0,"I am concerned he might try to do his normal people-pleasing and try to do both. There are some things you can safely bring a small baby to, but not everything. I'm concerned he'll try to do both and unwittingly hurt her."
1,"yeah, as someone who experienced years of remorseless cheating, this seems like... not that huge of a deal, to me. although i totally get how it would be jarring to find this out, because nobody wants to believe their partner is capable of even the slightest dishonesty or mistake.

on the other side of this, i am also an avid journaler and if my partner revealed that they snooped on one of the pages in my journal, i would have a REALLY hard time trusting them moving forward. personally i would prefer that they just never mention it to me so we can both pretend like it never happened (unless it's a habit, then of course i'd need to know).

so yeah, it's worth considering that you could do your partner the same service he did you, and not fess up to this one-time fuck up."
2,"Yeah. Frank, honest discussion is necessary if this is bothering you (and it's clearly bothering him). When it comes to someone's abusive behavior, it's important to make the distinction between their personal history explaining their actions vs. excusing them. It's understandable that your sisters ex has trouble creating a healthy relationship, but that doesn't give him license to hurt someone else "

4,"Sure, but until then, she can go anywhere she wants with the kids. OP can't stop her. "
5,"&gt; I know you will say guys your age are sooo immature. But I hate to break it to you, so are you.

Ding ding ding.  I hate to point this out because I don't want to jump on OP when she seems like a well intentioned person - but this post and the following comments just reek of immaturity.  If you have to ask these kinds of questions at all, then you are not really in the place to be in a healthy relationship, let alone one with a man nearly twice your age. "
6,"you wanted exclusive access to his emotional and physical intimacy. that is a relationship regardless of how you want to frame it.

he didn't want that.

so either you accept it and break up or you enter a true fwb situation where you are not exclusive.

you can't monopolize his source of physical and emotional inatamcy and then pretend it isn't a relationship.

frankly it sounds like he is being super fair about this he is respecting your wishes and returning back to friends. you're getting what you wanted if this isn't a relationship why are you so upset?

if you want a committed relationship why not tell him that? otherwise he is going to abide by the rules you guys established."
7,"So you just had a relationship with a end date, that's all. "
8,"This needs to be higher up. /u/Wolfonthecreek, you should read this one before you go to HR. For all you know, they may be trying to get you ousted. Maybe going to HR is the right call still, I don't know, but please read this one first."
9,"I missed it too, because I read the body of the post without skimming, it didn't feel necessary to read the tl;dr. Summaries don't usually contain new information. "
10,"&gt; He says that if I leave, I might as well not come back. For every minute that I'm gone, he will spend it hating me more and more and by the time it's been a week he won't want to see my face ever again because of how much he'll hate me and will never forgive me. He's so done. All I ever think of is myself and how things are affecting me, I'm so selfish, I'm crazy and he's always known it, and on and on... so incredibly hateful, not normal.

Those are horrendous things to say.  He is either mentally ill or abusive.  Those statements make me think he's abusive.  Abuse can creep  up and it can also be intermittent like this.  Check out RAINN dot org and do their abuse checklists.  I'm sorry you are experiencing this...it sounds horrible."
11,"Yea Matthew is being set up for a lot of emotional pain here.

There is nothing worse in the world than discovering the person you fell in love with was only dating you to advance their career. Whether it's true or not, even just the thought of it being true, in Matthews head, could destroy everything."
12,"OP your low tolerance is actually a blessing in disguise. I absolutely encourage you to be upfront about it with potential dates and stop talking to the ones that can't get past it. You don't have to waste time and energy getting to know the kind of person who is that shallow. I think a lot of reasonable people who enjoy drinking wouldn't want to date someone who was that judgmental either. 

There are a lot of single assholes out there. You just so happen to have a short cut to cutting through their bullshit and can move on faster than other people do. "
13,"If the president mentioned it in passing then this is a problem your Supervisor has, not a problem the president has. He extended a direct invitation to you that he may not have a problem with, but your Supervisor does because it puts you in direct contact with a superior.

That may cause her to feel a bit threatened. I'm not saying you should go above her when it comes to normal job tasks and duties, but I have no problem with the supervisors OR hourly staff who report to me go to my boss (the President of our division, coincidentally) for Braves tickets (we get them each season). It seems odd that this would be a point of contention, except for the percieved threat your boss has.

Let me reiterate - if it was mentioned in passing, you did *nothing* wrong. In this instance, I do not think it would be out of place to go to the president, face to face, and say ""I might have misunderstood your invitation from when I started, and I may have taken advantage of your offer. If that's the case, I'm sorry. I truly did not mean to come across as ungrateful or unprofessional.""

I can almost guarantee you, he will have no idea why you feel the need to apologize. "
14,Another glossy finish...
15,They will help the company by getting rid of the idiot supervisor who does crap like this.  He is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

17,"I've seen many angry women leave their husbands as soon as they get their degree.  If you want to save your marriage, OP, you had better try for counseling.

She sounds so angry still that she may not want to go with you, since she doesn't want you on the vacation.

If she won't go, get yourself some therapy so that your next relationship turns out better."
18,"LOL. I can see why this answer rubbed you the wrong way. But perhaps what they meant is that having more detail re: what you're looking for would help? If 'anyone who is not boring and nice to me' is your criteria, that's a bit too broad to find someone who will match you really well. 

As much as a 'list of requirements' thing is off putting, having a clearer idea of the kind of relationship you want can maybe help you find it?

P.S. I am a single 33F so we probably have the same issues.. I'm reading this thread carefully :P"
19,"Right there with you, babe. 39. Last committed relationship ended 8 yrs ago. Had a long FWB 4yrs ago, that almost became a relationship, but wasn't right for me. Otherwise, just dating here and there. I like sex, but i'd rather have it with someone I'm at least friendly with. (also an engineer!) 

-i/you have to take the lead in the dating sites. Start with an interesting conversation. I feel you on ""boring"", SO MUCH!! (profiles and msgs. Guys for heavens sake, if you send the 1st msg just say one thing specific to our profile, or activities in our pics. NOT about our bodies. It doesn't take long.) I give ""hey"" people one chance (if their profile looks interesting)  by answering with some kind of question/commonality for them to work with. If they're still not capable of having a normal back and forth chat, then forget it. I set small goals like one 1st msg a day, or 5 a week or something. After that, I put the app away so i don't spend time obsessing/optimizing. 

-i/you also have to find ways to meet people /create opportunities in real life. I have a hiking club, sports teams, volunteer, make a point to go to parties/events of people I don't know that well, to meet more of their friends. 

-make your single life a life you like! Find other kick ass (possibly) single women to hang out with. Make friends who you can rely on for emotional support/help painting/vacation buddies. It doesn't have to feel like ""you have to do it all yourself"",and a romantic partner isn't the only fix for that.  You are certainly not alone. 

-of course most people are not going to be a good match! But i/you don't need most people, you need the right one(s) for you. Don't try to force it, but do stay open to possibilities. Show them who you are,don't just go along with so that they like you. let them know if something isn't working for you, give them a chance to step up if they want. Or to let you know what they want of you. We're adults, it doesn't have to be a mystery/magic. Practice thinking about how you ideally want things to go rather than practicing cynical and frustrated thinking about how a date might disappoint you.

Keep your chin up! If there are qualities about yourself that you think make relationships challenging, then work on them! (temper? Communicating with respect even when angry? Mine is definitely being too cynical, and also not speaking up for what I want, going with the flow too much) 

Sure, many of them are not going to work out. But as long as you are meeting new people, giving it a try, finding occasional promising matches, then you're doing it right."
20,you're a shitty person
21,"&gt;And more importantly, do I share this information with Dylan? 

I don't see this benefiting him at all. Let him continue to move on."
22,"&gt;By the time I'm ready to move in with someone, I should be very committed to the relationship and on the path of staying together indefinitely.

I never saw it that way, I was always firmly in the camp of 'I need to make sure I can tolerate this person 24/7 for an extended period of time before I'm sure I can marry him.' But I *do* believe in being together for an appropriate amount of time before cohabitation. 'An appropriate amount of time' can vary between couples, but generally I think a year is a solid estimate."
23,"Lmao a lump at the table! That's how I Feel! He's came to a restaurant while we were halfway through our entrees. He just sat next to me with his cup of water until we were done. So ridiculous.

I know it didn't last long, but did you talk to him about it? How did he react?"
24,"&gt;he tried to shut his friend up when his friend mentioned the nudes.       
&gt;He knows damn well she expected privacy.

Replying just to emphasize those points. **He knew.**

/u/AThrowawayAccout, your boyfriend instantly reacted to his friend's comment by getting mad and trying to silence him. That's a glaring sign that your boyfriend *KNEW* you expected privacy, and he knew you'd be against the idea of his friends seeing your photos... so he purposely didn't tell you, and he purposely tried to cover it up when his friend spilled the beans.

That's really manipulative and gross. And then his excuse is that he ""never technically lied, because he never said he *wouldn't* show anyone the photos""... ugh. He still knew what your feelings were about it! So he deliberately did something behind your back that he knew would hurt you if you were aware of it. **That's like the definition of a betrayal.** 

He doesn't even feel appropriately bad about his actions, or realize *why* it was so wrong. You would be completely justified in breaking up with him, if that's what you decide to do.
"
25,"It's very unacceptable what he's doing since it's not only invading your boundaries, but also that of your friends. 

I would strongly encourage you to tell him not to ""pop"" up where you are. And that if you ask him to leave, that he'll leave.

Maybe put it it writing to better articulate your thoughts? It doesn't matter how you do it, but he *needs* to know that his behaviour needs to stop.

What do your friends think? I'd imagine your friends are also uncomfortable about him showing up uninvited when they're handing out with you.

28,"asking once and bothering you are two different things.

ask them nicely to stop worrying about the subject, and that you appreciate their concern, but you don't want to talk about it."
29,Some will be turned off. Others won't. Do whatever feels right to you and it'll help filter out bad potential matches. 
30,"You have to break up. Do not be pressured into a relationship style you are not 100% on board with. Monogamy vs non-monogamy is one of those classic hard deal breakers, and at least one person will end up hurt if you do go through with this. "
31,"I've told this story before, but it may be relevant here.  One morning years ago, I came downstairs and there was a girl asleep on our couch.  We lived in a townhouse complex, so there is some consistency in architecture, but the furniture would be different.  She had been very drunk, and fortunately didn't come all the way upstairs and crawl into bed with my wife and I, or with my daughter.  Anyway, just saying, you can be drunk enough to not realize where you are, or what you're doing.  From Tom's perspective, if someone crawled into bed with you, and they're similar sizes and shapes, I can see how you might be confused.  You'd have to be pretty out of it to start having sex with the wrong person, but given what people do in their sleep, it's certainly not impossible.  Finally, if it was an affair, why would she wake you up and tell you.  Why would Tom call his GF?  Why not just do it and shut up about it?"
32,"You are not a bad person. It is totally normal that after so many years together at such a young age, you would want to see what dating someone else is like. But respect for your girlfriend means ending things before pursuing your co-worker. And that doesn't mean ""things got really close to cheating so then I ended our relationship."" It means breaking up before consciously flirting/pursuing someone else.

If you don't want to break up with your girlfriend, then you need to shut down the flirting with your co-worker."
33,"&gt;chauvinistic


What the...


&gt;Have you considered approaching her about an open relationship? You could be with her then and she could still retain her sexual identity.


The fuck?


You have no clue what the dynamic was between OP and this girl, and making these assumptions is a bit unfair. Implied exclusivity is a thing, and OP has every right to feel the way he does. Does that mean the girl is a horrible person? No, but OP isn't either for being a little hurt by it. 


And really, an open relationship? Considering the reason why OP posted this to begin with, why would you even suggest that? "
34,"You still havent explained why you would share a video of your nipples being pierced with someone who wasnt your partner?

What was the thought process exactly?

Would the same apply to a video of your masturbating? Why not?"
35,"You're right about the broach, 100%. 

But I definitely think the ""insulted his family"" part is way off base. I'd say ""his family feels insulted"" because, frankly, this is such a silly thing for them to be mad about. I get that SIL was excited to be a bridesmaid, but she basically just appointed herself to the position without even asking the bride. Why should OP make someone a bridesmaid that she barely knows or doesn't get along with or doesn't like or whatever? Let this be a lesson to SIL about not inviting herself places and not making assumptions.

I will say, some people view weddings as a coming-together of two separate families, but not everyone does. OP wants her wedding party to be filled with people who support her and with people she loves. Personally I think OP could've said ""okay why not"" to avoid all of this drama (it sounds like OP - much like her in-laws - is also taking her own wedding a little too seriously, but that's her prerogative I guess), but she didn't. Now she knows her in-laws are dramatic people, and now her in-laws know OP doesn't value them as much as they thought she did. Tough. 

Where does OP's husband stand on this issue? "
36,"It doesnt say she's been crying continually either, or crying in front of people other than potentially her mum. Crying to close family isn't a tantrum. And yeah she's an adult, but she's a young adult. She's only 20, she's still learning about life and relationships. I'm a grown woman and I obviously know other friends who are grown women, and if people's feelings are badly hurt then crying can be a normal physiological response. I do think that she might be over emotional about this but wouldn't consider it a tantrum.

And a mum being protective of her daughters feelings and sticking up for her, in what way is that not normal?

I have a feeling we might have to disagree on this. I find this thread very interesting because all the commenters seem to have various and very different opinions about the behaviour of everyone who's involved. "
37,"Could've dropped some IOI. 

Me: Pick me pick me pick me up~

Her: How about no. "
38,"I mean, I'm in the school of telling your SO almost everything, because they're the best person to tell/gossip with/etc. So yeah, I'd tell, if only to unleash that secret. "
39,"Well, first of all, a woman who would hold your sexual past against you (unless your sexual past included stuff like rape and pedophilia) wouldn't be the right woman for you. 

But moving beyond that, it sounds like the cause of your shame was that you were having sex that you didn't enjoy or want to try to make yourself feel better, not that it was with other men? Whatever the cause of your current feelings on your past, though, I would encourage you to seek therapy if you can afford it so that you can come to terms with your past and your motivations. If you're feeling shame and self-disgust because you're worried that this makes you non-straight, then therapy would be helpful. And if you're feeling shame and self-disgust because of how having sex that you didn't want but felt a need for in order to get validation, then therapy would be even more helpful. "
40,Well the rent and everything else has turned him into and entitled brat.  Dude needs a wake up call and a half and you need to give it to him

42,"He's nearing 30 and telling you what to do with your body. Strange, does he shave his legs? Tell him he needs to."
43,Honestly sounds like a shitty relationship that should just be allowed to die.
44,"You do realize how he's handling finances now does not support the idea that he'll actually combine finances once you're married, right?"
45,"Threads where someone is using a person's past against them never side with the person doing so. They are always told to work out their own insecurities. 

A good partner doesn't use someone's past against them as a way to discount their character and then expect to be applauded as the best partner ever, like OP does. 

"

47,"You are both legal adults. Looking older makes no difference, but maturity level does. If her friends are seriously having that much of an influence on how she feels about you, she may be too immature to have a lasting adult relationship. You deserve better. And....Gray hair is hot. Just saying. "
48,"I mean the point is that you took it upon yourself to get back at a guy from HER life.  The guy sounds like a creep and all, don't get me wrong, but in terms of your own relationship, you probably shouldn't make unilateral decisions on things where she's more closely linked to the issue than you especially.  "
49,"This is just a wild guess but could he maybe be feeling a little insecure? Like worried that you might be leaving him behind, that you might find someone while you're out and about that has those same extroverted interests as you do and you'll choose that person over him? Or he might simply be jealous of the attention your friends get. That could also be why he doesn't want to talk about it, because he is embarassed or knows that it isn't rational, or he doesn't even know exactly why he is upset or can't articulate it and therefore he just wants to pretend it didn't happen.

Do you two have things that you do together beyond just hanging at home? Like any activities (even those done at home) or shared interests? Are you still giving those as much time and attention as before? Does he feel like you are? If you DON'T have those kinds of homebody shared interests, I can understand why he might be worried. He might feel like you don't have much in common now that you have a bunch of new interests that don't include him (not that you're purposely excluding him, but it is fact that there is a big new part of your life that he isn't a part of because of his introverted tendencies)."
50,"Girl, you keep on doing what you're doing. These guys are awful. "
51,"If your sister's intended hadn't proposed for 10 years, there's a good chance her wedding is NOT going to happen. There are numerous ways he could derail the whole thing, and he has every incentive to do so. If your sister is driving YOU nuts with her drama, what do you think she's doing to him? He could totally back out and blame it on her - ""I just can't deal with you, bridezilla."" Which would be awful for her, but she picked him.

You are never going to win with family like that. The more you try to use logic and reason to make them treat you fairly, the more they're just going to double-down on being awful. Love shouldn't be ""earned.""  If they can't treat you like a beloved family member now, they're never going to - so give up. Focus on your fiance and the wonderful life you can have together. That's your family."

58,"I'm really not sure I understand your post. I read it twice and I'm still confused.

What is your jealously issue you about? What do you mean you don't get jealous enough?

Also, about the ex-gf, are you saying you're not over her?

You gotta clear it up a bit, man."
59,Haha that's the only part of the story I could focus on. He just digs through a bathroom trash can (the grossest trash can of the house) and searches through crumpled toilet paper? What a disgusting thing to do. 
60,"I can understand why you would be upset because marriage is not something to joke about. He should apologise, you accept the apology and then move on. 6 months is short, but people still get married at that time so, like I said I understand why you'd be upset. 

Apologise and move on. "
61,"Please listen to this, OP. 

Don't fuel the fire, and document the harassment in the event that you need to cover your ass."
62,"This is a serious miscommunication. I honestly would be reconsidering my relationship over this. She needs to understand that your cats are part of the package, which means you gotta have a difficult conversation with her. 

Personally, I'd never be with someone who expected me to go rid of my pets. "
63,"No, the priority is to pay your four walls (food, housing, utilities) first - ALWAYS - and then comes debt and savings.  No exceptions.  Whether or not you paid your credit card payment isn't going to matter one bit if you don't have a roof over your head or any electricity or water."
64,"Hi OP - I'm in your wife's position. After 2 years of trying for a second, including a miscarriage and 3 failed rounds of IVF, I gave up at the end of last year.

I say this with all kindness: Had my husband tried to make this a ""celebration,"" I would have completely lost my mind at him. Please don't do that. I get the impulse, but it would be really cruel.

Instead, she will probably appreciate some stepped up support and care. Personally, I would have liked a short post-failed-IVF vacation to just relax and spend some time away from it all processing and  thinking about what I would like my life to look like now. 

Maybe ask her if she would want to take a weekend/3 days away and then arrange babysitting and schedule everything for the two of you (or alone, if she would like that better). 

I think you should put your sentiments about how much you love and care for her, etc, into a letter and give it to her when the time seems right. 

And OP - this is happening to you too. Give yourself some space to feel your feelings as well.

Good luck to you both. It's a painful, hard thing, but you sound like you guys will make it.

67,"I'm going to disagree with your point regarding her age and tech skills.   I'm also 45, I got my 1st computer in 1981, and since I started my career in 1992, I've worked on computers.  We are not ancient, we've been around computers almost our whole lives.

68,"Hijacking this to say I would have honestly replied with, ""We're not ruining everything. It is not our fault that not everyone has the ability to adult."""
69,"I'm so sorry your going through all of this while pregnant. Your husbands behavior is unacceptable he's emotionally cheating, he's ""in love"" with these girls because he doesn't really know them. So it's more he's creating the idea of the perfect women in his head. It's even worse is that his only form of communication he has is via texts or written words instead of verbal. All those issues are not your fault you've done your best to be understanding. You deserve to find someone who treats you with respect and wants to share a life with you. Is there any way you can go back to your family? Just because you are going to be a mom does not mean you are stuck or that your life is over. It's not going to be easy, it will be hard for a long time and therapy is definitely a great option, but the difference is you won't be dragging out the pain. If you stay chances are in five years things might be worse, or ten, and the longer you wait the harder it will be. Pain is something humans want to avoid so we'll do anything to protect our hearts, but pain also does not last forever and you will come out the other side happier and stronger. The reason I suggest leaving instead of working things out is because this relationship is one sided. You have personally done everything you can do for him, it's him that needs to change and as long as you're there I don't think he will. You could try one last ultimatum but he's the one with the issue not you. "
70,"&gt; The filth of the floors is not a concern to him because we still have a few months to have everything cleaned in his eyes.

72,"Honey, you are having a baby in 2 MONTHS (or less). You need to tell him that, for the rest of your pregnancy, and the first few months of your child's life, that HE needs to step up and take care of 100% of the household tasks. Believe me, no matter how much of a superwoman you are, you won't be able to handle it all without his support.

If anything, it will give him an idea of how much you actually do around the house. Then you two can get on a schedule with chores/childcare that requires equal contribution. 

If he refuses, then I think it's time you rethink why you decided to marry and start a family with a man so selfish and unwilling to be a partner. "
73,"Why would you still pay if you don't go? It's not like you are flaking, you weren't invited. Just ask them for your money back. Surely that is an option, no one would make you pay for an AirBnB that you won't actually be using. "

Because I would strongly recommend you start looking, unless you plan to live in his parents' home until he's ready to leave (which, based on your post, is not any time soon.) Yes, it will suck to live apart, but you shouldn't put a hold on your independence because he's not ready."

89,"Well, I am not a guy, but if he is dropping hints about getting engaged, it could crush him if you swooped in and asked him instead.

91,"Okay, so you've only been in relationships previously where you were, say, fond of your partners - you liked them but didn't really feel that you loved them? Do you think there's a reason for this? Something that's happened to you in the past to make it difficult for you to feel that you can unreservedly 'love' a partner?"
92,"My girlfriend and I have a shared google calendar and we put literally everything we do in there. Work, prepping dinner, movies, chores, etc... everything goes in there. We both have the calendar widget on the home page of our phones, so we always know what we're doing that day. I'm telling you - in terms of productivity - this was the best thing I ever did; once I put something in the Calendar I actually did it... (chores included). If I see a blank spot on the Calendar, then I have free reign to put whatever I want in there (So long as I pay for it if she doesn't want to do it) and vice versa. 

If you and your wife choose to adopt this, then I'd bet she'd be more willing to do things with you, or if she doesn't then she can't really get mad at you for doing it by yourself."

Have you talked to him about switching careers or furthering his education?

Have all your talks about goals long-term and vague? Have you discussed short-term goals that you both have, or do you have any concrete ways you're working towards your goals?

He should definitely start building credit though. ASAP.

97,"Thanks for your answer. Well I don't get my parents' choices, nor my grandparents ones. I saw my grandmother, her voice breaking, say to my sister on the phone that she loves her. 

My sister was to my grandmother's house this summer and complained all the time about my grandmother being too loud (my grandmother has a bad hip and has help at home). She acted like my grandmother is deaf and stupid. She took all the money she could from her. Then at Christmas I suggested to my family to go visit my grandmother, because she can't travel. They all came, except for my sister who didn't bother to answer. That's when I witnessed the sobbing on the phone and the I love you. 

I guess those people rather have shitty relationships than nothing. I can't use reason further than that. "

104,"It sounds like the BF pushes her boundaries often. If this was an isolated event, or something that OP felt markedly neutral about, I might agree with you. However, even without the concept of bodily autonomy trumping a partner's desire, I think it's telling that the BF is actively pouting about something that he wants but which simultaneously makes his partner feel LESS sexy. Not exactly a sign of a good relationship. "
105,"Even if he was just shocked, it is unacceptable to take his emotions out on her. He needs to talk to her like an adult, and trust her when she says she didn't know about her ex. If he doesn't trust her, why is he even with her?"
106,"How is this even going to work, with the people who were at the wedding? Do you and the ex look alike?

I suspect he plans to not even tell people that he's gotten married, after your wedding. He might say ""vow renewal,"" or he might not say anything and just ""go on vacation"" when you're on your honeymoon. Because he's written himself into a corner here."
107,"&gt;I cry myself to sleep most nights

This is such a bad sign.  You mentioned you don't think you can leave for financial reasons but that's not necessarily true.  It may be incredibly difficult, but don't convince yourself that you're stuck forever.  Start making a plan.  Figure out what needs to be done so you can leave this relationship.  Then take it 1 step at a time.  

Regardless of whether or not things happen with your best friend, I think you need to leave this marriage anyway.  Don't stay with your husband as some sort of a consolation for not getting your best friend.  That's not fair to anybody in this situation."

Just food for thought, I guess..."

113,"Yeah this is abusive. My guess is he thinks he can do this to you cause he has you at a point where you won't leave anyway. 

This is no way of treating a person ever. Don't put up with that shit. Tell him next time he loses his shit at you like that you will leave immediately. For your own sake. No one deserves to be treated that badly. This is really horrible! 

If you want to give this relationship a chance make it clear to him that he needs to get help!!!! I think he knows he fucks up. If he gives a crap about you he will go to therapy and recognize his behaviour is abusive and shitty.

Leave immediately if he denies it or blames you!!!! Immediately!!!"

115,You cannot build a relationship on a foundation of lies.
116,"What she said was horrible, but I feel that the fact that she tries to minimize the attitude is even worse.

I mean, if she acknowledged her mistake and the proportion of what happened, you could at least be sure that she understands what she did (and that she repents) and would be careful not to do something like that ever again. But her attitude implies that not only she doesn't see it (nor does she care) about the harm she may have done, but that it can happen again in the future since she doesn't think it was a big deal.

This is a big no no."

123,"My perspective on this is probably skewed because my job entails working with impoverished people in a major US urban center, but the examples you give of things that ""frighten"" your wife.....I think she needs to toughen up if that's REALLY the reason. She's an adult, she needs to stop acting like a tiny delicate flower who can't interact with poor people. And I say that as a small female myself. I thought from the title that maybe she was a targeted ethnic group in the new state, which could be very frightening, but it sounds more like she's just scared of panhandlers.

NOW, that being said, I can't help but think perhaps that is not really her issue, and that its being home all day with kids and not making any adult friends that is really causing the problem. I think some other people have given you advice about how to help in that area, but I second giving her a day or two off from child care so that she can go to the gym, take a class, or even get a part time job to meet people. She needs to make an effort- she can't run home to her parents for the res tof her life- but you need to help make that a possibility."

126,"I don't want to make this sound dramatic, but I do want to make it clear how serious this COULD be.  It's a big deal.  Bad breath is always a symptom of something more- sometimes a lot more.

**That in mind, please understand that my dad had awful, AWFUL breath, and ultimately it killed him.**

My dad was horribly dentist-phobic.  He brushed regularly enough, I suppose, but had a bridge of false teeth and we never saw him floss or use mouthwash.  His breath was... rough.  Just not great.  Sometimes truly terrible.

In his later years he had an untreated gum infection that slowly spread.  It gave him several issues but ultimately the issue was that it reached his heart.  He was a marathon bicyclist and otherwise had a great heart, but he developed complications from the infection that led to strokes.  The last stroke killed him.  

It had been noticed and was being treated throughout that year and was improving.  He died a few weeks before his final surgery to repair the heart damage.

So, sorry for the scare-story, but old man breath can be a symptom of many awful things, and even if its NOT life-threatening it needs to be diagnosed and dealt with.

He needs to see a dentist, even just for a cleaning and appraisal of health.  He one-hundred-percent needs to floss and use an antiseptic mouthwash.  The dentist will tell you the same: those gums are at huge risk for infection, and floss and listerine go a long way.

I deal with similar things myself.  I have disfigured (cryptic) tonsils myself from a bad illness (complications from mono) years ago.  This can occasionally lead to tonsil stones and awful breath.  I have to use antiseptic mouthwash regularly to manage it.  

You're perfectly right to be turned off by it.  Not only is it gross, but it's a primordial instinct to BE repulsed by it.  If he won't deal with it for his own health, he should at least do it for the relationship."
127,"Toilets are meant for shitting. She is being a weirdo. She should not be policing others' bathroom business and you should get a paper trail started even just at your desk in a word document, of every instance that she HARASSES you (yes use that word) about your normal bathroom use. Then you have something to refer back to if you ever escalate it. Meanwhile, continue shitting in the proper shit receptacle known as the toilet. "
128,"You guys definitely need to talk this out. Money can sometimes be a difficult and awkward topic to discuss but this is just going to build up resentment if it goes unchecked.

I would not recommend accusing her of expecting too much or anything, but just be honest and upfront about how her behavior is off-putting, and what you consider to be a fair distribution of expenses. I would also be upfront about how you'd like to use your increased income, including on things that would benefit you both long term (savings, house, etc). Maybe she's feeling insecure, like she could get shut out of your life as you move on to bigger and better things/people with your money, and is trying to ""claim a stake"" now? "
129,"You're being abused, and abuse slowly escalates. But if you won't leave him and he sees no problem, then maybe start practicing how to cover up bruises with makeup? Get used to walking on eggshells? Start formulating excuses for his behavior (you're already doing it by pointing out what he sees at work as being a reason). This is sad."

You need to stop worrying so much about your sister - you are also pregnant!!! Congrats. Enjoy your pregnancy, stop trying to mediate a peace between your sister and everyone else. She cares less about that peace than you do. 

Could you ever imagine treating people the way your sister is treating people? I doubt you could. Everyone needs to stick to their ground here. Being pregnant doesn't give her a pass to treat everyone like shit.

134,"&gt;We really need to spend some of this money. Our business had a terrible couple of years and I've basically been working for free. We had to put several months of our employees wages on a credit card and that interest is eating us alive even in good months. 

If your business is failing, perhaps it's time to stop throwing good money after bad and give it up.  Businesses are supposed to make money; yours isn't doing that.    "
135,"I would guess there's a very good chance he is depressed or having other psychological issues. That doesn't mean that you don't need him to step up. In my experience the best way to address this is to focus on your needs, while expressing concern. ""I need a partner who is going to act like a partner and contribute to our family. You used to be great at this, but lately you aren't following through or contributing. I can't keep going on like this, and I'm starting to get very worried about you. I need to work to become the partner you used to be, and I'm starting to think you need some help to do that. I need you to be healthy.""

Push for a therapist or psych evaluation by a medical doctor. If he's very depressed he probably doesn't see a way out of where he is, and he might need to get a push to get moving, but you need to insist on your needs being respected, too. If he's actually taking steps to make things get better, still expect it to take some time."

139,"&gt;I doubt he'd ever by me tampons

This is a relationship test I used about a month in. Anybody who couldn't buy me tampons or pads wasn't someone I wanted to date. Is it a little embarrassing for guys? Sure. But if they care about you they will ask you what size, brand, for a pic of the box, live chat you from the aisle asking which one and then they buy that shit without trying to hide it or being embarrassed about it. It's really not a big deal. Girls need these items. Any man should be able to buy what his partner needs without being embarrassed about it."
140,"Where does he eat? At my workplace you aren't supposed to eat anywhere but the break room. Does he have somewhere he can go and eat lunch or does he have to go out everyday? Maybe he didn't think about that at first and now he is realizing he can't afford to do that. I saw that you got this email right before quitting time, but you should probably go talk to him about what happened to make the deal not ok with him anymore. "

That's pretty scary for your family :(.

But they still do, at least with in the last year or so, my husband had some on a flight within the last year (funny bit is he didn't eat them and left them in his truck, it was almost a year later I saw them and asked if they were from his trip lol).  

Though I do think airlines have a special requirements thing when you book a flight, so maybe if someone on the flight is allergic maybe they don't do the peanuts but pretzels instead? I'm not sure how it works, but last time I flew (couple years ago) it was two flights and one had peanuts and one had pretzels.  *shrug*

I mean, what are the rules?  Do you get final approval of every person he follows or just the females?  Did he know of these rules?  Finally, this may have gone a lot better if you had approached him like an adult and told him that this made you uncomfortable and why and then let him make his own decision.  Instead, he now feels like an emasculated boy left to feel like a pedophile (by someone supposedly who knows him best).   Sometimes you just have to feel uncomfortable.  I don't like every decision my wife makes.  But I love and trust her. And she is an adult.  Being a couple doesn't mean you have to be OK with everything each other chooses to do.  Now, if you don't trust him...well that's quite another issue.

Secondly, I think that if you want to do some introspection as to whether this belief is biphobic or homophobic, you'll have to unpack the reasons *why* this is a turn-off or dealbreaker for you. I realize that emotional reactions aren't always 100% logical, explainable things, but if you can go beyond ""it's a turn off"" into *why* it would (again, **in theory**) be a turn off, then you can actually explore the possible biases involved.

It does sound like he didn't speak to them about the car, but honestly you shouldn't really have to tell people not to park across your own driveway on your own property, I mean, who does that?! It's just a completely selfish asshole thing to do that shows you have zero consideration for your neighbours. And if they were unco-operative regarding the noise, perhaps he thought speaking to them about this would also yield no results. 

**Not that I'm justifying him calling ICE**, but they really do sound like neighbours from hell. Can you imagine 20 people coming and going all day from one residential house, talking shouting, playing loud music, kids everywhere, and now them parking in your space. That would be a nightmare to live next door to absolutely irrespective of ethnicity. I do think he should have tried to work things out with them a different way, and even calling the police would have been preferable."
151,"&gt;&gt;Basically in high school he had a lot of personal problems, he didn't have much friends due to very much enjoying video games, he had friends he played online with that he knew from school and he enjoyed it so I didn't want to take that away from him. 

&gt;My guess is she thinks if she HAD taken them away, he might have been ""forced"" to interact more with real life friends and the family. 


TBF it sounds like most of the people he plays with are real life friends from his school which I kind of get- theres something to connect about in person and he does have real life friends who he presumably sees, but their hang out time is digital not personal- which as a person who likes her friends, but values down time, its awesome to just shut off the game and then be done with people for a bit rather then ushering them from the house, wrapping up convos, waiting for their rides, etc etc. So its a little different then if all of his friends were solely online

And now that she's expressed a belief that you actually might care about her, you wonder where this idea came from and want us to help you let her down gently?

158,"It sounds as though you and your boyfriend have different views on finances in your household. He wouldn't have made that comment had he not been thinking it, and probably for some time. 

I'm in a similar situation with my husband, but reversed. I'm the breadwinner in the house, and have been supporting us for a few years now. For a while there, he was going through a very hard time, and not in a position to make an income. I was genuinely happy to cover our expenses. 

For the past year or so, however, my husband has been capable of making an income. He's found it difficult to do so, as he was out of the work force for some time. I've been frustrated watching this, because I know that while he can, my support has made it so that he didn't have to. Granted, his income wouldn't be anywhere near what it used to be right now, but it would be an income. A way to contribute and take some weight off of me. 

I have tried very hard to bite my tongue and simply keep supporting us. My finances are good, and I can do this. However, from time to time, I start to feel taken advantage of and I will bring it up. It stresses my husband out, causes a fight, and is never fun. But at the same time, I feel like it's important for me to bring up. 

Maybe this is what your boyfriend was doing, in an admittedly unpleasant way. I'd suggest having an honest, thorough talk with him about finances. Discuss your job situation - are you able to work at all, even for a lower wage job than perhaps you'd like? If not, are you eligible for disability? If neither of these are possible, perhaps you can broach the idea of an allowance of sorts, that you can use for personal items that you aren't accountable to him for? "
159,"Lots of countries have needle distribution/trading programs because they'd rather drug users have a regular supply of clean, safe needles to use rather than reusing old dirty ones."
160,"This is honestly really simple. It's okay to want to fuck other people. It's okay to want to be with your boyfriend. You just have to decide which is more important to you. 

You can't have your boyfriend *and* fuck other people because he's not interested in an open relationship. Which is not wrong of him. Nor is it wrong of you to be cool with an open relationship. Everyone has their own take and there's no *right* or *wrong*. 

If you want to have sex with other people more than you want to be with him, then you break up. It will suck, but you won't be breaking up because you don't love him. It's just because your urge to have more sexual experiences can't be reconciled with his feelings against an open relationship. That's not either of your faults and it doesn't mean you don't love and respect each other. It just means you're incompatible right now. 

If being with him is more important than sex with other people, and his love is enough to fulfil you, stay with him. It sounds like you're choosing this option. 

If you're trying to repair the trust, a good place to start is by telling him you weren't *asking for* and open relationship, but rather just wanting to find out what his opinion on it is. And emphasize that choosing to be with him means that you really don't need to fuck other people for fulfilment. But only say this if you mean it.

163,"Hey. View from the kid's perspective- do it now. My father left my mom about a year ago and it completely blindsided her. She's 60 and thought that she would spend the rest of her life with him. A year later and she still hasn't really recovered.  I was living with them at the time while I went to graduate school and everything my father did basically fell onto my shoulders because my mom couldn't handle it/ she has health issues and can't do everything around the house. Instead of moving to another city like I wanted after graduation, I stayed to help and have basically been miserable. My father also lied to me a couple times about it and his whole handling of the situation has really damaged our relationship- maybe beyond repair. If he had done it five years ago I feel like it still would have been hard, but much better than what it's been. Anyway- obviously situations differ, but if you're sure that you don't want to stay married, then the longer you wait the worse it will be to leave. Staying ""for the kids"" does them no favors."

170,She's going to teach him how to know that a condom fits properly? I don't think so. Can you imagine how humiliated a 14 year old boy would feel asking a strange woman for that advice? You're nuts. That's not the school nurse's job.
171,"Jesus christ, the hardcore divorce reactions on here are absurd. I think a fundamental part of it is people commenting who have never smoked weed in their life and think it's the devil's lettuce. 

Millions of people use THC/CBD everyday, including hardworking parents that provide quality care for their children. Just because someone uses cannabis doesn't mean they're going to be incapable of responding to the child's needs. Functional stoners very much exist.

The real problem is your husband not thinking critically about having to drive you to your appointment in an hour. He didn't think his actions through, and therefore your mom had to pick up the slack. That is not okay; he should have made your medical needs and his responsibility as the driver a priority. The good news is, prioritizing responsibilities is an issue you can absolutely work on together. It's not something to divorce over. Perhaps seek couples therapy."
172,"I'm sure OP's boyfriend sees the distinction. That doesn't mean he has to approve or be comfortable with it. Many people would consider this a dealbreaker. OP's boyfriend at least gave it a chance and went in open, which is something not a lot of people would do. I'm thinking of how I would be in his situation and it would probably make my stomach twist and turn, especially if it looks realistic and they are good actors. "
173,"There is only one reason for him to text you. He is not waiting for you to text or whatever other excuse you want to give him. He is using you for sex, enjoy it while it lasts. "
174,"Other commenters have nailed it on the head by recommending consistent reporting. I just want to add that you may want to keep anything valuable/breakable somewhere else safe, like with a trusted friend who lives nearby. Never hurts, just in case. "
175,If that's the case then its less of a jealously thing (that's great btw) and more of a loneliness/missing you feeling. Did you ask him about doing ballroom out of curiosity? 
176,"Honestly, this couldn't be more wrong in my opinion. 

My first girlfriend was wild. She partied, drank, smoked weed, was a go go dancer for a few months, and really didn't have her shit together. No job, always going out, tried going to beauty school but got kicked out... I'm the complete opposite. I have a stable job, don't drink, never smoked, never really partied or went clubbing, or really anything she did. She was my first girlfriend so I put a lot of effort into it, spoiled her, saw her all the time, and followed her along to the parties where she would do whatever crazy shit she wanted to do and I would kinda just sit there conversing with people. We broke up because, well, she was fucking wild. I also paid for EVERYTHING because she didn't have a job and just really had no money at all. 

My most recent ex ALWAYS brought up my first girlfriend, thought I loved her more, thought I had more passion with her, thought the relationship was more exciting, etc. and we always fought about it. She said that I paid for everything in my first relationship but I wasn't paying for everything in this one. That's not true, I paid for 90% of it, she would pay for food sometimes. Mind you, we were in a long distance relationship so I paid for her plane tickets, the Airbnb for when she was here, the planning of where to take her in NYC, EVERYTHING, so I didn't think letting her pay for a few meals when she was here too unreasonable.. She's a teacher and has a career so I thought our relationship was way more balanced. But that never stopped her from comparing every aspect of both relationships, up until the very end of our relationship. She always said that she was getting the shit end of the stick, that I took her places that I already went with my ex, not as many presents, that she was just a rebound (we were together for a year and a half.....), and that I would do whatever my ex wanted me to do. She also had self esteem issues, so she always said she was fat.... even though she is only 115 pounds at most, does yoga, is absolutely gorgeous, and is in really good shape. 

I tried my hardest to make her believe me when I said that my first relationship was nothing compared to this one, even though she wasn't with me all the time and we had to fly back and forth to see each other. Being with her, it was the most amazing thing in the world and I couldn't even describe how in love with her I was. I never felt that way about my first girlfriend, even though she was my ""first love"". But no matter what I said, no matter what I did, she would always compare the two and make herself seem inferior, make it seem like I didn't love her half as much, and just really put a lot of doubt in her own mind. 

She wasn't a ""silver medal"". She was first and would always be first, no matter what. But sometimes, people get wrapped up in what they think they see, but it's completely wrong. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, that's something I never really saw with my first girlfriend. But there was nothing I could do to make her believe me. If I had a choice between the two of them, it would always be her. No questions asked at all. "
177,"It's really creepy how much effort you exerted to find out so much information about your gf's ex.

This is absolutely none of your business."
178,"&gt;I'm just looking for advice on how to make my fiancée feel better and not as stressed about it.

Well that's obvious. Be fully supportive of your fiancee kicking her out of the wedding party if she wants to."
179,"Dude, your *sister* is manipulative. Her boyfriend got into *one* argument with your fiance and now she's trying to break up your goddamn marriage over it. She won't stop bringing it up with you and trying to convince you he's a bad person based on that one incident, she's harassing your boyfriend by calling him or texting and starting shit, and she's actually *setting you up with other guys*.

How about you tell your sister that she can be in your life once she accepts he's in yours. That doesn't mean she and your fiance have to be friends or hang out, but it does mean she can't bother him anymore or bring him up to you anymore. Tell her if she can't do that, then your relationship with her is over. See if she's capable of listening and respecting you or if she loses her mind over it and doubles down (""he's trying to isolate you, oh no!""). I'm betting the latter will occur because that would be consistent with her behavior as you described it in your post---fucking manipulative. "
180,"WOW thank goodness you guys didn't date. You don't owe him anything, I second everyone who says to block him. You're not overreacting, in fact you might be underreacting. People will say to tell authorities but the best thing you can do is tell everyone in your life. When my roommate had a stalker (which this could very well be) we told everyone at our building, our jobs, and in our friend groups. It's not something to be embarrassed about. Get this guy out of your life! "
181,"Uh huh.

I think there are some feelings you need to compartmentalize here. You're flattered, you're shaken up, maybe even entertained or feeling like a savior. Make sure you're acting in your best interests and not on your feelings, especially if you're codependent (if you're feeling like you need to save him, that's codependency).

Tbh even if he escaped the relationship tomorrow, he wouldn't be a good choice in partner. He has a lot to recover from."
182,"Trickle truthing will only hurt you in the long run. You need to just be honest and own up to it. If you keep lying to try and save her feelings or save yourself face, will make it less likely to reconcile. "
183,I don't think this is a good idea right now.  It would probably be better to introduce Dan to these people slowly and under controlled circumstances.  Maybe you or Kevin could arrange a small party at one of your homes.

186,"I don't think that's what that poster meant by ""mombie"". It's totally fine to talk about your kid with friends, but some parents end up totally losing themselves to just becoming ""Mom"" and wrapping their entire identities around their child(ren) and then speak of nothing else. Even if I kind of like your kid, I don't want hear about little Susie's daily bowel movements, what she ate all day, how she was sick last week, and how she did a simple block puzzle isn't she a genius??. It's exhausting. Like, fucking talk about something else once in a while and have a two way conversation instead of talking at me about your child.

I had a couple friends like that and ""mombie"" is a really accurate term for it. Those friends ceased being the person I knew before and become ""____'s mother"". *Every* conversation or activity had to revolve around their baby or include it. I had to cut those people out because it wasn't a friendship anymore, I was a wall to talk at for them."

190,"Hm... I find it *very* strange that people are so certain about what happened here. Maybe everyone is correct, but I'd like to mention something that I haven't seen mentioned yet:

Alcohol affects everyone differently. Sometimes people black out, do stupid stuff, and then start coming out of the blackout in the middle of that stupid activity. Or maybe she wasn't blacked out, but maybe she was just so out of it that what she says is true, but the full weight of the situation hit her as it was happening, and right when she realized it, she stopped what was going on and went to tell you.

Anywho - If she *intentionally* cheated on you, why would she *immediately* tell you about it?"
191,"Unfortunately, this is common and will probably continue for a long time.  My friend had a caucasion, redheaded mom, and a full Japanese dad.  The three kids looked completely different.  They got comments constantly.  I LOVED how they dealt with it.

The Mom preferred to stare, silently, dead into the persons eyes (if it was strangers), and wait as long as possible to say ""really"" and walk away.  The Dad handed out little cards with the Genetics Punnet Square on it, with the title ""Genetic Trait Inheritance for Idiots"".  It was genius.

For family or friends, they actually would sit down with them and tell them that their comments were rude, hurtful, and could damage their child's self-perception, and would they like to be the one responsible for the child feeling different?  It usually shut people up.  "
192,[removed]
193,"I understand you're upset and other people have provided some good feedback there, but I'd also like to mention that it's unfair to look down on the other women as 'dirty whores'. Everyone has to try to make a living somehow. 

Demonizing sex workers doesn't solve any problems. Your boyfriend is the problem."
194,"But you're not a traditional man, and to paint yourself as one to those women is disingenuous and deceitful. Straight men don't resort to sex with other men to ""get off"" due to lack of other sexual contact. "
195,"Your sister is the one raising these children. Therefore, unfortunately for you, all the decisions are down to her. It may be easier at the moment for her to just pretend that your niece has a brother rather than an uncle, just for her to understand. My niece is four and still calls her grandad Dad. It doesn't mean she doesn't understand, and it won't always be like that. Also, your half-brother is just a baby. It wouldn't matter to him whether your sister was his mum or his sister at this point, as long as he's getting looked after.

Your niece having an uncle younger than her isn't the worst thing in the world, it will be okay. "
196,"This is correct; Each time you have sex there is a 1% chance you will become pregnant. Period. This is not cumulative… If you have sex 100 times that doesn't mean any time you have sex after that there is 100% chance or more? Lol, that would be ridiculous… 

If you use condoms correctly, there is practically a 100% success rate, however sometimes they can and do break, which is why it is advisable to use other forms of contraception as well."

You say, ""No, Mom, I'm sorry.  I need this money for college tuition, books, and rent while I'm in college.  Thanks for understanding.""  The end.  No more arguing.  Nothing."
199,"So, she:

Isn't sexually attracted to you anymore.  
Is getting nude photos from other men.  
Spends more time out of the house than in it.  
Refuses to go out with you.  
Leaves you to do the bulk of housework and childcare.

What part of this is a marriage anymore?

If you guys don't want to get divorced, then it's time for all of the above to change.  I recommend counseling and complete transparency with phone activity and social media, because while you don't think she's cheating, I think she's reeeeeeeeal close."
200,"Lots of really shitty relationships have good things in them. It doesn't mean it's a good relationship. You are an adult, no one should have to tell you to not be so critical, to not yell at people for stupid shit, to not criticize someone you supposedly love in front of other people. It was a series of problems that piled up and up, and you yourself said there has been no improvement on your criticisms.  Any time someone doesn't leave you after you piss them off, that's another chance you are getting. 

It takes a whole shitload more than love to make a relationship actually work. "
201,"How this works in a healthy relationship:

Her: ""Hey, it really hurts my feelings when you criticize me so harshly.""
You: ""Oh, crap, I'm doing something that hurts the person I love. I should apologize &amp; fox that."" [Works to fix it ]

How this worked in your relationship:

Her: ""Hey, it really hurts my feelings when you criticize me so harshly.
You: ""Okay, but you still talk about how you love me, &amp; you're still here, so it must be tolerable, right?""

By allowing the pattern of behavior to continue (despite having a clear understanding that you were hurting your partner), you burned through ALL of your extra chances. "
202,"To give the other perspective, what OP is describing would not be odd to me at all. Most dates are usually ""dinner and a movie""... so opposite sex friends should not go out to watch movies or go to dinner alone as often as they want because it's too ""date like""?! What is this, 1960?

Also a lot, A LOT of people will not back off a good friendship bond because of other people's irrational insecurities, regardless of who these other people are.

OP this is your insecurity, you have to work on it on your own by a huge part. It may be that you see them interact better together than you and your girlfriend interact, so work on YOUR relationship, don't try to sabotage their friendship."

"
205,"WTF?! Confront your gf and honestly, this person isn't a friend to your relationship. I would not be ok staying in this relationship unless Katie is an ex-friend to your gf. Talk to your gf, tell her how you feel and let her know that something needs to change here. Remember, that change may end up being you leaving the relationship. But, it's obvious that Katie is not a healthy friend to your relationship and you shouldn't stay in the relationship as long as she's still around. "

214,"Don't go back to him. He pushed you into sexual acts you weren't ready for and if you take him back you're normalizing the idea that that's okay for both of you. And it isn't. You need someone who is going to respect your boundaries and wait for your clear, enthusiastic consent. "
215,"&gt; To me, there is a line between friend and roommate that we must identify and respect boundaries.

Even friends need to identify and respect boundaries.... but no, I don't agree with you in your idea that somehow you can be roommates with someone and also neutral toward each other. Successful roommates need to also be friends--maybe not *great* friends, but friendly. 

I'm also a private, sort of asocial person, so I get what you're saying. But your attitude is *incredibly* pretentious, and it doesn't lend itself well to living with others. You don't need a roommate, you need a cat. "
216,"Be very very careful about doing so much leg work for him.  The things you describe have all the makings of codependence. He needs to start making his own appointments and taking ownership of his own recovery. If he's only doing it at your request you are going to be the one that takes all the lashing out when/if he relapses.

Also booking a trip is another way for him to run away from his bad feelings. He's replacing alcohol with the excitement of a trip. He needs to face his pain straight on.

I dont mean to be all gloom and doom, but addiction is one hell of a problem and I dont the think you've researched how deep it runs in a person. The fact that you've normalized his other drug use is also very troubling.

If you keep cushioning him from feeling consequences he will never have a reason to change.

219,"This.  /u/Lifting_Breh you should probably be discussing four options:

1. Staying exactly where you are

2. Moving within your current city

3. Moving to another city in your current state

4. Moving to your wife's desired state

Within each of those scenarios, look at:

* Pros/cons

* Possible improvements/changes to those pros/cons

* Costs/income

* 6 months/1 year/3 year/5 year plans

With all of that written out, you might find that the best idea is to stay where you are for 6 months, move to another city for the next two years after that, and then move to your wife's chosen state afterwards.

It's important to position this as looking at all your options.  Your wife needs to feel like she gets a say in this, but she has to be open to both pros and cons of each scenario.

Honestly, I wonder if you might have moved into a not-so-good neighbourhood because you didn't really know anything about the city when you got your job.  It's pretty common, and it can be dealt with pretty easily by identifying and moving to the kind of neighbourhood that is more your speed."

It is up to a parent, and only a parent, to decide when you can meet their children- especially when the kids are young. 

...is it supposed to be a bad thing that she cancelled a date to care for her sick kid?  Because if you think it is, you are not mature enough to date someone with a child. The child comes first. Period."
225,"Why don't you go with her to buy things that you do like? You say you don't like things that fit like skin and things from the banana republic/j crew catalog. Not all fashion trends are like that, and honestly you can still wear comfortable non-work clothes and look nice.

A well-tailored pair of jeans goes a LONG way. Go to Nordstrom and buy a couple pairs of jeans that fit nicely and they have tailors on staff who will tailor them to your body for free. They may be expensive upfront but I will tell you that there is nothing more comfortable than a nice pair of perfectly fitting jeans. My boyfriend got some jeans from Nordstrom recently and his exact words were, ""the material these jeans are made out of is so soft, is this what women have been hiding from us all these years?""

A nice fitting tshirt goes a long way too. You can get a lot of basic clothes like sweaters, tees, etc, that fit nicely and are flattering. You need to try them on though. Since you say you ""know your size"" and don't try your clothes on before you buy them, they may not fit as well as you think they do. Could be too baggy in places, hem is too short, shoulder width is too wide, not the right fit for your body, etc. 

You can still pull off the jeans and tshirt look as you get older, but they need to fit *really well*. I assure you that will make a difference."

Is there a college nearby?  Sometimes students are looking for temporary housing.

A hospital nearby?  Travelling nurses are a thing.  They work 3-4 days at a hospital, then go home for their days off.  Most of the time they get a stipend for travelling to use on a hotel.  If they found a temporary room instead, they'd save that stipend to use on themselves.  I currently do this with my spare bedroom.  They are typically cool, courteous people.

234,Your girlfriend sounds like she's better suited to date a 2nd grader. Her restrictions are ridiculous.  You're a grown man and have the right to watch what you want. I wouldn't stay with someone who policed my choice in movies or tv. That's just straight up crazy. 
235,"Okay, so it sounds like he's cranky because he does a bad job regulating his sleep. If he could commit to a bedtime &amp; a waking time, he would probably feel much better. But that's not something you can make him do. I wake up at the same time every day for work, so I wouldn't have any patience for tiptoeing around someone that stayed up too late &amp; now wants quiet until 11 am. (If he worked a night shift, I would have different advice about being more considerate of each other, but...)"
236,"I agree that this might be the result of intense insecurities but it is very different than the situation you just described. This girl is letting her own psychological issues dictate the behavior of someone she loves. Her priority should be to work on resolving the issues in herself. If this means that he does not watch movies with nudity while she is there, then that could be a way for him to help her with this. But she doesn't get to use her insecurity to limit someone else's happiness."
237,"&gt;  I think if someone put a time limit on how long I can take to cool down I would be upset.

Bear in mind that this isn't a time limit on how long you can take to cool down. (well, it's that too) It's a limit on how long you can leave your partner suspended in argument-limbo before he gets to start cooling down."
238,You are NOT a jerk for expecting her to pull her own weight. You ARE a jerk for not communicating this in a straightforward manner. Talk to her. Remind her of the agreement you guys had. 
239,"1. My husband is the same way. I use to ask for 'permission' all the damn time and it pissed me off. Then, I just sucked it up and realized I'm a grown ass woman and have a life of my own. I tell him in advance if at all possible. But it's not ""Is it ok if I do this?"" How you word things makes a HUGE difference. I say ""I'm having a girls night on X night. We don't have anything planned that night do we?"" and not ""Can I go out with the girls X night?"" ""I'm going to so and so's party on X night. They would like us both to come. What do you think?"" You are a duo so it's cool to run things past each other as a consideration but if he tells you NO with no good reason, that's definitely a huge problem.

2. IMO, this is non-negotiable. Even if you have zero plans to divorce, everyone should have some security money. Things happen. What if he gets in a car accident and his personality changes and he starts hitting you? You're financially stuck. I made this mistake in my first marriage. Do it. Don't ask for permission.

No marriage 'works' the same way. It's an agreement between two people on how things work for them."
240,"&gt; Sorry for trying to get a friend to help another friend.

they're not really friends anymore given how things ended, and OP *did* try to talk to/help him. it didn't seem to work out... so the next step is he should talk to him more?

that doesn't seem like helpful advice, especially since the friend doesn't seem to want to correct this at all (as evidenced by not telling his wife and taking another trip with his mistress), and that's why you're getting flack.

not to mention- if they're having a baby, i'd say dude has more of a duty to his other friend, the wife, since she will be the most severely and negatively affected by OP's friend's actions if they continue and she gets pregnant. wife is far more likely the one who has to deal with raising the child (in addition to the 9 months of pregnancy) than her husband. child support is not a comparable burden at all."

May as well speed this process along."
248,If you can't have an adult conversation with him on what he means by wifely duties then you should not be marrying him until your relationship finally gets to that point. 
249,"Ignoring your sexual needs NEVER works, trust me I've been there. This is something that will only get worse the longer it goes on. The fact that she says it's gross? This would be a deal breaker for me! You obviously have different views. 

I also think it's terrible how she's asking you to buy her expensive things and gets mad when you say no. That's just awful. If you get her little things every now and then I don't see why she can't just get the big stuff she wants herself. Plus it's just kind of ""tacky"" to ask your bf to buy you things? Like if you offer to it's different, this just sounds like she's trying to take advantage of you. 

Breaking up is really hard but I do hope you go through with it or start thinking about it. You could be so much happier!

Focus on yourself, and keep doing your thing, but make sure she knows you're there to support her. Just know that her distance may keep her from coming to you at all. If she appears to get worse, I'd offer to get her some help.

You are right to feel upset and violated.  Talk to her about it and tell her it is 100% not ok for her to share those pictures, taken without your consent, to her friends without your consent.  Tell her you feel violated and angry.  Then see what she says.  Any attempt to down play her actions or tell you that you are over-reaction needs to be shut down immediately."

As for the rest, both are true: Bob is lazy. He should be doing more and he isn't doing his fair share. But expecting him to do everything is, I agree, unreasonable. "
280,"This is absolutely unfair to you.

Look, I know being home with a toddler is a lot of work, but somehow my wife managed looking after two small children, keeping the house clean, cooking, and taking the kids to various events/playdates around town while she was a SAHP. Your husband sounds lazy. He can't even clean up the food your kid mashes into the carpet? That's left for you to handle? smh

I can understand that he can't get everything done during the day, with your son being only two and probably a handful, but that doesn't excuse him checking out as soon as you get home, turning the ""second shift"" over to you entirely while he plays games. *Especially* since you're taking care of the baby while doing all that housework -- which proves combining child care with housework can be done, right?"
281,"This definitely screams abuse. Just things that you said like ""you can't do what he wants"", him waking you up before dawn to go buy groceries, and even more so, the fact that he didn't ""let you"" have friends tell me that he is extremely controlling.  I know you are in a tough spot right now but it is for the better that you are out. 

Definitely have a friend acompany you, or better, a cop, like /u/notquitecockney says, to pick up your stuff. Contact a women's shelter or a good friend that you lose contact with because of your ex to have a place for a few days until you get on your feet. "
282,"I really do want to talk to her and I think she knows that which is why I think she told me before hand we weren't going to talk about it.

305,"This conversation always goes the same way the million times we've had it in this sub. What is really boils down to is if OP finds in unattractive, they're probably not compatible. 

I understand this is a real ""illness?"" that people struggle with. But it makes them incompatible with me.

Also, immature doesn't have to be derogatory. Fried chicken, fish sticks, spaghetti, and potatoes isn't exactly a healthy diet. It is what we in the US often call ""kid foods"" (this isn't a thing in many other countries). So, sure, it could very well be a sensory issue. But the fact that she pretty much only eats ""kid foods"" makes it simultaneously immature.

I'm 26 and still take shots when I go out on weekends. I'm immature too. I'm not hating on the girl for it. But she will need to find someone who is okay with this aspect of her personality."
306,"&gt; I am also thinking on the possibility of going back (an absolutely novelty for me, I've never gotten back with anyone) and going to couple's therapy to solve our issues.

Nahhhhhh, you seem rational and made a sound choice based on a number of things that were not working for you.  You can only give so much especially with the career you have. Your job isn't to make her happy, your job is to make yourself happy so you can be happy together."
307,"Like I said, listen to her more and accept that sometimes, you need to put aside what you want for the benefit of her and the relationship. It doesn't have to be anything drastic, but at least understanding where she is coming from and attempting to alter your attitude is a good start. It helps that you now at least have awareness that your behavior isn't the best. "
308,"It's hard to tell if this kid just doesn't have good boundaries being set or if there's something more going on here.   One of my sister-in-laws has a kid who we were all wondering about - as in, we were wondering whether he was going to start eviscerating cats or something, because he showed no empathy and enjoyed hurting others for the attention it got him.  Eventually, he got a autism spectrum diagnosis, which explains the lack of empathy at least. 

If your parents aren't following through on discipline, you may need to sit them down at have a serious talk with them about how your brother's unchecked behaviour is making your life difficult.  An itemized list with times and dates will help drive your point home. If they don't listen, or try to minimize it as ""he's just a kid, go easy on him."" then you'll have to start working out how to make your life manageable until you can move out. 

First? buy a lock for your door and keep as much of your stuff as you can in your room. 

Knowing kids like this, they're looking for a reaction from you.  Instead, give non-punishment consequences. 

  For example, if you see him bothering your younger sister, step in, scoop her up (figuratively or literally) and say ""hey, looks like it's time for us to hang out together where we can be nice with each other."" and go spend time with her away from him.   Don't look at him, don't acknowledge him. Just go hang out in yours or her room, close the door and do something together for 15-30 mins.    It'll remove her as a target, and deny him the attention he's looking for.  

If he's swearing at you, or otherwise using bad language, pretend not to understand him or hear him.   ""Huh? what? huh? are you saying something???"" 

If he's tossing your stuff around, as long as he can't break it, let him.  He'll get bored if you don't get upset. 

If it is something breakable or important, quickly remove it from his grasp without saying a word and lock yourself in your room.  Let him cry and make a scene. If he's not hurt, there's nothing you've done wrong.

310,"The thing where he tells his co-worker you are his ex-wife is gross and terrible and CAN NOT CONTINUE, and he does it because he's embarassed/ashamed/knows it looks bad that he's getting married again so close to his first marriage. 

Tell him his first wedding was not yours, and you want the wedding YOU want. If you need to wait (and you really should, holy shit the whole thing seems too fast) then you should.

But for real, you can not let him to continue acting as if you and first wife are the same person, that really needs to stop and he needs to explain to people he's hoodwinked about it that you are a new woman."
311,"So my friend is orthodox and I know I could ask her this question, but I don't want to seem rude or anything, but why can't you type the word ""god""?"

313,"Yeah, well, abusers and manipulators like to keep you confused. That's just another sign of the nature of the beast here."
314,"&gt;However, anytime I've brought her up he can't help but smile

Why is he not allowed to smile? Like seriously, having a problem with that is absurd. 

Also, why in the world were you bringing up his exes so often? How are his exes any of your business?

&gt;The issue came on the way home. He couldn't stop smiling! It bugged me so much and I'm still annoyed. Is he not over her? How can I breach the topic? Should I let it go?

So, let me get this straight. He was nice to her, she was nice to him, parted ways like adults, and you are mad that he...didn't mope? Should he have been crying? Does he need your permission for when he is allowed to smile? 

Honestly, you just sound either bored in this relationship and looking for a reason to leave, or you are incredibly jealous of his exes and his more adventurous relationship.

315,The hurt from a breakup is very different from the hurt that comes from being involved in something that makes you extremely uncomfortable for an indefinite period of time because you feel like you have to. 
316,"I've heard of a lot of parents who didn't feel connected to their children until they got past the toddler, small child phase and started developing into their own person. I don't think it's wrong, it's just that there's so much pressure on people to be perfect parents that hardly anyone talks about it, or when they do treat it like it's a massive taboo
"
317,"Sounds like everyone in that household is a mess and is more interested in egos and power struggles that supporting each other and getting things done. You have to be the bigger man. Have maturity, control your tone and volume, command the situation softly and leave him having to find excuses for his behavior rather than you find excuses for yours. Either do the right things in how you express yourself when tensions rise or you will be nursing your ego after in that kind of environment. Dramatic people love the struggle and will try every trick in the book to unbalance you or cause you to have a knee jerk reaction.
Have a goal. If their behavior escalates watch your own tone and body language. Focus on your goal and not how the other person is making you feel. If they take it too far calmly excuse yourself and either try again later or accept that's the best they are capable of and you need to try and find alternatives."

319,"&gt; I started getting burnt out, so the CEO and I decided to hire an assistant.

Good idea...except everything you then described as things you expect her to do fall **well** outside the normal job description of an assistant. 

&gt;This is an attribute I can't compromise on, because she handles a lot of daily accounting stuff.

You basically described an entry level analyst/accounting position in the following paragraph. As a manager, this one is on you as you need to properly address the job function you are in need of and to hire properly. Assistants are people that organize and manage meetings, take notes, schedule travel plans, file expense reports, etc. 

Obviously you are going to have to fire her or move her to an actual assistant job. My advice would be to support her any way you can and to also acknowledge that you dropped the ball here in determining the scope of the position you needed to actual hire for. "

It's a tough spot but one thing is apparent your father is unhappy. Your mother is unhappy and their marriage needs to end. Maybe if he knew you knew and that you had no judgment he would be open to divorce. Supporting him in his quest for happiness in a different way. Most parents stick together for their children or the idea that they will disappoint them. Now that you're an adult you can push him to putting him self first in a non deceptive way. "

340,"Leave her alone. If your idea of her ""warming up"" to you is that she *looks you in the eyes*, then you're beyond saving with her. And frankly from this retelling, I highly doubt you'd be interested in her when things got serious anyway; you seem to have a very serious problem with only being interested in new things you don't know (Anne before you got to know her, new girl when the feelings were still shiny). You're just going to harass her until she gives in, and then break her heart in a few months when you get bored.

Some things aren't fixable. And that girl doesn't deserve the hamhanded attempts at fixing when you can't even be vulnerable enough to tell her that you like her, or to honestly apologize for the crap you pulled."

Which, by the way, he wouldn't be wrong about. If that's what's actually motivating this. You need to ask directly and have an open and totally honest conversation on both of your ends until he tells you his reasoning."

344,"You're over reacting. In a super dramatic way. You made yourself the victim in this situation by trying to manipulate your SO into throwing them away because your cousin died from an overdose. 

He's not abusing drugs, and despite your  seemingly acute awareness of the damage abusing prescription drugs can do, you seem to be blind to the actual  signs of a prescription drug abuser. Him not throwing away a bottle of drugs is fairly normal, taking them for sleep probably isn't the best method to getting a full nights sleep, but it certainly isn't something an addict would do.

He's not seeking more. He's not taking them in unusual methods, snorting, or consuming more than a prescribed dose at a time. He's not being secretive about it. 

Although you object, you need to get your emotions in check. Maybe get some grief counseling. "
345,"It's not like she's saying this all behind your back maliciously. She straight up told you, which indicates that she didn't intend it to be malicious. Intentions don't matter much when the end result is that your coworkers look down upon you. If you really had a warm relationship and you have no reason to think she would react poorly to you having a conversation about this, then I think you should bring it up to her. Ask her to stop calling you that, and that you have noticed the other coworkers treating you differently.

Think about it from her perspective. Her favored employee who she has made exceptions for in the past and might consider a friend, suddenly stops talking to her and gives her the cold shoulder. Of course she's going to react negatively, she has no idea why you've stopped talking to her. Her dropping hints was your invitation to bring up your issues and solve them in a professional manner.

The flirtation thing is another problem altogether. You can bring that up in the same conversation if you feel comfortable, but you should also think on whether or not you would have the same reaction if a straight woman had said whatever she said to you. Keep an eye on it, document anything you find upsetting, and then escalate if you find a problem."
346,"I'm sorry...but taking care of your own child is not childcare. And as she pointed out in the post, the kid is in school now. Also, a bill for housecleaning? Something normal adults to so they don't live in filth? 

I don't think presenting the way you suggest is a good idea. I mean, he could come back with ""look how much I'd save if I wasn't paying for your food, your clothes, your share of the rent/mortgage, etc."" "
347,"Exactly!  
  
My bf of 9 years (living together for 7) provides almost all of our income, but we still consider everything to be our money. I would never say ""we"" are getting paid when talking about his paycheck. It's his name on the check, not mine. I'm not the one doing all the hard work to earn that paycheck. ""He"" is the one doing the work to contribute to ""our"" finances. Once ""he"" receives that money, we consider it ""ours"". "

349,"How many pathetic posts are you going to make about this 45 year old you're into.


Maybe he doesn't like dating people who could be his daughter. 


Maybe he's just confused.


Maybe you should stop posting about him 3 times a day. "
350,"EDIT: Red wine daily isn't customary in Norwegian culture.

She has a single glass of red wine daily. Though whenever it exceeds that when I'm around (which isn't too often) she said things like:

""You're just for me...just for now. And then we can go our separate ways"" After 6 months of being together.

last year when we were scrolling through my facebook profile I listed myself a month before she saw it as ""In a relationship"" after being with her, dating her, sleeping with her, and talking travels for a year. She just looked at me and said ""Who are you in a relationship with?"" we already had the relationship talk way back. We re-established that we were in after I just told her we could just go our separate ways if this isn't what she wanted - but she ran after me, convinced me that I misunderstood.

That night we went dancing somehow - she was holding her things as we danced on the dance floor. A tinder match lit up on her phone in front of us. I couldn't get myself to say anything and pretended it didn't happen so I don't puke."
351,way to completely miss the point
352,"Do your boyfriend's parents happen to pay for your BF's half of the rent? I was in a similar situation in college where my roommates sister was always at our apartment. Almost exactly how you describe your BFs brother. I finally realized that she assumed that she could hang out and stay there all she wanted because it was her dad's money paying the rent. I explained if that was the case they needed to pay2/3 rent to my 1/3. 

There's was nothing malicious or spiteful going on, the sister just didn't understand.  She was young and just assumed it was theirs because they are family.  She didn't understand the boundaries changed when I was in the equation or that its different whenyou get out on your own.  Your BFs brother might not realize that yet either."
353,Id tell her in front of him you might have caught something from her while scratching your junk
354,"This is the exact female equivalent of ""my girlfriend used to do all sorts of crazy sexual things with her ex that she refuses to do with me"" threads that pop up on here all the time. It really sucks being in the position where you think your partner had more passion with previous partners. People may say stuff like ""the only thing that matters is that he/she is with you now"", but it's a naive way of thinking. Just because someone is with you now, it doesn't mean you are his/her first pick. And evidently, if your BF did a lot more exciting stuff with his fling that he doesn't do with you, he probably had more passion for her. Not trying to be a dick -- this just seems to be the reality of the situation. 

In the end it's up to you to decide whether you want to settle for being someone's silver medal or finding someone who will see you as his gold medal. Personally, if I were in a relationship where it seemed like my partner didn't have as much passion for me as previous partners, I would break it off. "
355,"I understand that. OP was speaking in generalities, I was dispelling that. Some people have a problem, some don't, but there's no sense in adding that to his pile of fears about sharing a bedroom when he doesn't know if he will have the same problem at this time. I'm trying to tell a 17 year old not to use ""I read it on the internet"" as part of his argument."
356,"There is no guarantee he will mind going to all her races. Some people wouldn't. Not everyone desires the same amount of space or seperate/free time in a relationship. 

I think this strategy could very easily backfire with him going to all her races and then what does she do? Say yeah she asked him to come to all her races but she won't reciprocate? Or tell him it was a manipulative ploy to use up his weekends in hopes he'd be unhappy? "
357,"&gt; it probably isn't likely you'll see him often anyway. 

Except now he knows she lives next door and apparently thinks this is ""fate"". And he's already found a way to tell her (or insinuate) that he's given up his trust fund and gone no-contact with his family as a result of the actions that lead to their breakup. So he clearly still carries a torch for her and likely will keep finding reasons to try and see her or make contact. "
358,"If it bothers you that much then you should leave. The fact that he lied to you about it says a lot, and now you will have trouble trusting him. I found out my husband pays cam girls sometimes and even though he was super up front about it, it still bothers the hell out of me. "
359,"Yeah just being told would be a serious turn off for me, and I also don't consider strippers cheating."
360,What are you asking her to do? 
361,"I agree with Kiratear. It's another persons wedding and you don't want to argue at it. Try to ask her to be seated away from your sister, if she can't then you're gonna have to be mature and act professionally. You don't even have to talk to her, just think about it as ""two people that are going to a wedding but don't know each other or want to talk to each other"" thing.. if that makes sense. Of course you can answer questions short but you can signify by not maintaining a good conversation to let her know that you don't want to speak to her."
362,"Oh, sorry, I know how it sounds."
363,"I'm sensing you're leaving out important information about your relationship.

She has never brought up issues with the cats before? Is it common for her to throw wrenches around so late in the plan? How would you rate your communication as a couple? Does she come from a non pet friendly culture? "
364,"I would suggest that you don't worry about telling her about how she is perceived.  I'm not sure that would do anything other than make her alienated from you and hurt her.  What you might try is to influence her management style by providing her books, articles, TED talks on management.  There are lots of stuff on positive management, setting clear goal, etc.  I would think with an MBA she would be receptive to those management books.   I do think you run the risk of hurting yourself by letting her know what your boss confided to you.  I think you're helping her more by just trying to give her positive direction.  I would hope the company has already directly addressed her performance.  Ultimately, she is a grown woman and responsible for her decisions. "
365,"Absolutely the numbers! Over the course of a year I think I talked to about 350 men on OkCupid, met about 15, had a short thing with two (sequentially, they were not good picks) and have been with the ""right"" guy for almost two years. So a 0.29% success rate for conversations, ""success"" being a relationship longer than three months."
366,"You're right, it's more than just the boat. We've never been on the same page when it comes to finances. We don't share accounts. He gives me an allowance each month. When I start working again, I know that this will also become an issue because he'll either want me to pay him back for the years that he's supported me or he'll want to share income at that point so he'll have free range access to my income. We've been avoiding the topic for a while. I don't know how other marriages handle their finances, but what we've had going on for years doesn't seem right. I'm embarrassed to share this with my own family because my siblings seem to share their income 50/50 regardless of who is the breadwinner. "
367,"&gt;He'll barely speak to me all evening
&gt;I went to his apartment last night to hang out with him, his friend who was visiting for the night and whom I'd never met but was super keen to, and his new female roommate. I made an effort to be kind, friendly, funny. It was a blast and we had a lovely time - but he barely interacted me, when others laughed at my jokes he barely reacted.

TBH it sounds like he doesn't even like you

&gt;At what point in a relationship do you accept that you're completely different people to when you first met, in a way that can't work?

When it's evident that they don't even like me"
368,"&gt; This doesn’t affect my recognition of people or objects.

She addressed this in the OP."
369,"Wouldn't be as weird as being in your dad's nasty house. 

I could have a different sort of view point, as much of my youth was spent in a long series of many kinds of various trailers, but I don't see an issue. "
370,I consider this. Take a screenshot of Katie's message and send it to her boyfriend. 
371,WTF did I just try to read?  
372,"&gt; i don't go into detail.

That's why they hate you. It's not rude. You know if you tell them you want multiple weekly hookups with different women you will get turned down more often. "
373,"I did. There's a specialist a city over who I went to. I'm avidly against self diagnosis, because it makes us people who actually have medical  issues look bad. "
374,Gaslighting is manipulating reality to make somebody question their sanity. Nothing your boyfriend is doing sounds like gaslighting. It sounds like regular old lying and being inconsiderate.
375,Because you still need the exposure to adult situations while your brain is growing.  If we waited until 25 for people to be legally considered adults then they wouldn't learn as much from those mistakes they will make.  The process the brain is going through is called myelination.  Look it up.
376,Just have an open discussion on why she feels the need about buying you new clothes. If she really doesn't like your style then you should explain to her that you're not interested in changing but you appreciate her efforts. 
377,"I'm usually one to jump at the spouse being crazy and controlling but that doesn't sound good to me either. 

That sounds like one hell of a pill to swallow for a SO."
378,"You should DEFINITELY tell your parents. You have no idea how long this has been going on, and there is no guarantee whatsoever that she won't do it again. "
379,She wanted him to congratulate her for fixing it.
380,"&gt;Shaving is not a hygiene issue.

I read somewhere that we've retained coarse hair on our heads, eyebrows/faces, and genitals because it protects you. It can protect your head if something hits it (not a lot, but if you dropped a small rock on someone's head, it might cut the bald guy but it'd probably bounce off the girl with her long hair in a bun), eyebrows and eyelashes are there to keep random bugs and dirt from getting in your eyes, and pubic hair is there to keep bacteria out, protect the genitals, and (for women) maintain stable pH to prevent irritation and infection.

So if we wanna talk about hygiene, it's technically way ""dirtier"" to shave ;)

Buuuut since we're not cavemen, and we have running water and soap, shaving is not a hygiene issue either way. Most of us are too clean for shaving/not shaving to have any affect on health."
381,"I'm guessing you don't think the gym membership was romantic/special, but it was a point of contention in our marriage in the early days that I wanted a gym membership &amp; he didn't want us the spend the money on it, but he paid for this woman's gym membership when they were on-and-off again as part of wooing her. 

Today I have 2 gym memberships (one near my house for convenient workouts, one inconveniently located for swimming as my local one doesn't have a pool), so obv. we worked that out over the years (and also have a better cash flow nowadays)."
382,"If you're not into partying there are some wonderful natural areas within a one or two hour drive from Disney.  Go tubing down the Ichetucknee on hot days, you lay back as the current slowly moves you along with the cold water below and the hot sun above, pure bliss.  Or go hiking/biking in the Paynes Prairie preserve.  Visit the beaches.  There's a lot more to Florida than Disney.  Have fun!"
383,"This. On of my HS best friends came out in college and got angry that most of his old friends we're ""Cool, whatever get us another beer. We knew you were gay since high school"". 

He pouted a few month and we had to give him a reality check that us not giving a fuck was as positive as it can be but he got better. "
384,Your revenge fantasy is kinda adorable.
385,"If his gums are bleeding after brushing he has gum disease and that's most likely what you're smelling. It can be healed/cured but it really needs to be a focal point. I buy floss by the bulk because my dad lost his teeth early. I know that smell and it's bacteria and rot.

He needs to go to a dentist and get on a cure plan. He needs to floss literally after every meal, brush, and then rinse with a dentist recommended oral rinse. I know flossing sounds annoying after every meal but it gets to become routine. 

This is very important because while it might just seem like it's the mouth being affected the bacteria will travel through the entire body causing a host of other problems. Gut problems, digestive problems, and heart disease just to name a few. 

He's young enough that he can still fix this but if he doesn't get on it now he'll probably have no teeth left by the time he's 40. He'll be getting extractions in a few years and may have to get some now. Deep root rot can cause abscesses which can kill. The smell is probably some deep root rot.

I would treat this as a medical condition rather than a ""gross smell"" issue that tries to be covered up. Treating symptoms never works."
386,"&gt; brother is busy and he'll want to go though mom's stuff too

""Okay, fine.  Talk to him, and let's block off a day/weekend in the next couple of months to get this done.  Or let's pool our money and hire someone who specializes in estate sales to figure out what's actually valuable, and you can pick a few representative things to hang on to before we take care of the rest.""

You've tried being polite.  Time to be direct: this stuff is not Mom.  Hanging on to it will not bring her back, just as getting rid of it doesn't erase the memories.  And if it's not something they've thought about until they stumble across it in the pile, then they're not going to miss it as much as they think they will.  The sooner they get past that hurdle, the sooner they can start figuring out what to do about the house in general, and the sooner the two of you can start thinking about a future and family of your own.  "
387,"&gt; You're making 110k more than her, honestly that is a gap but not a sizable gap.

I'm assuming your edit messed this up? Because... holy fuck. That is a huge gap."
388,You're not getting it.  It doesn't matter.  Someone can be anyone online.  It has been two weeks.  You have never met.  You cannot know someone that you have never met in that short amount of time.
389,"&gt; ""I'm happy, if you're not it's your own problem""

Despite the above being a shitty, insensitive, or even abusive thing to say to one's partner, there is a kernel of truth here. If he is happy, and does not want to change, you cannot make him. Make yourself happy. End this relationship and move on with your life."
390,You can probably take solace in the fact that their relationship seems to revolve around you. 
391,"You've had feelings for this woman for seven years.

You acted romantic with her the next day. You didn't feel regret, you felt *good*.

When you tell your husband, you need to tell him that you're going to quit your job, and that you're never going to see or speak to this woman again."
392,"I'm not sure what she expected when she started dating a teenager.  You were still a kid, not an adult.  You hadn't finished developing (you still haven't) and she shouldn't have expected you to act like an adult partner.

If you are having physical symptoms from mental illness, you need to focus on yourself.  Please see a doctor.  Take care of yourself first and let her take care of herself.

She is nowhere near too old to start over with someone else, and she should not be guilting you into something you aren't ready for."
393,[deleted]
394,"I'm pretty sure what's he's saying is that he's now reconsidering the relationship. 

If someone can't lock in the details, barring any mental/health reasons, on a ""forever"" item, that's supposed to be a symbol of love and the right choice, are they really the right spouse? All he asked for was no gold, it's a simple request."
395,You already did. You chose her. 
396,[deleted]
397,"How many of those friends have someone that loves them, gives them HJs and wants to spend time with them? Don't listen to them man. They're either jealous, insecure or both. There's no such thing as the man card and if there were it would be being secure in who you are, what you like and who you like. You have something great, go with it."
398,"Well, although I completely agree with you about the loser bf, I would respectfully contend that the mother is also fucked up and unhealthy psychologically. They are a dysfunctional dyad, those two. "
399,"Okay, but EVEN if it was a chronic issue, 5 minutes isn't a lot. Also, not addressing that issue is pretty harsh too. To outright tell her to go home is kind of messed up. "
400,"I despise people being late. It's a huge pet peeve of mine and I think it's terribly inconsiderate at best. Notifying someone when you are literally 1 min late is perfectly okay. In fact, I've done it myself a couple of times (exactly w the same times in your story) and I am very very rarely late. Best guess is he was pissed off about something else and took it out on you.  "
401,"Say ""While I accept that it's your choice that you don't want to shave your body any longer, it's not what I signed up for and as a result I'm no longer physically attracted to you.  If we can't find a way to come to a compromise, I don't really see how our relationship can last.""  Because that seems to be the truth."
402,"She may be your mother but she has some serious growing up to do. Tell her to shove it and make it known that you are extremely disappointed in her as a person and as your mother. Hopefully your dismay will teach her a lesson. She clearly needs one. Play it dramatically. Stop talking to her. She's not getting any younger, hopefully she'll realise how much she has hurt you. "
403,"It sounds like your wife perhaps does not find that very attractive. You're, of course, free to dress the way you want - it's your body! But it sounds like your wife thinks you look attractive in different clothes than the ones you usually wear, and, I mean, I know my husband likes certain styles on me, so I wear them on occasion. Why make something small into a huge deal?"
404,It's easy cause it's the right choice 
405,"No, you absolutely are not wrong.  You have your own life and goals.  Your brother's decisions and life are not your own.  Absolutely set boundaries.  

"
406,"&gt;I would expect that for both of you this is at the centre of things.

For sure.  Raising kids is hard at the best of times and having mental health issues surrounding it makes it that much harder.  The thing is, she has had dabilitating anxiety since the beginning and I have supported her so much through that over the years.  I feel like she's just throwing my issues in my face coz she can't deal with it.

&gt;As a couple, leaving her propensity to remotely flash her tits at people she knows, what is the quality of the relationship between you? Could it be better? Could both of you be making more of a contribution to improving your relationship? Problem is, do both of you want to make that contribution? Is it obvious to the other person how their partner regards the relationship?

It could be better.  She's always doubted my commitment (being married with 4 kids isn't enough apparently).  Just last night I went to the office to do some after hours project work and she was hounding me about who was there and if any females were present.  She's very insecure.  I have seen a psychologist many times and he says we're in a caring paradox - I'm not always honest with her about how I feel because I don't want to hurt her feelings.  The times that I am honest, she takes it very badly (any kind of criticism).  So yeah, our relationship isn't in great shape BUT we have been through A LOT of tough times and made it through the other side.  One of our daughters has high functioning autism and she takes a lot of energy to manage day to day.  Our lives are crazy and honestly it's no surprise that she does something like this to escape it all but at the end of the day she knows how I feel about it, I've made it very clear, and right now I feel like she's broken my trust and disrespected me for the last time.


&gt;You have a problem in the immediate term, that you have discovered her latest transgression but you have done so by perusing through her phone when you probably shouldn't have done. Incidentally, why did you do that?

We went to a theme park on the weekend and she took heaps of photos.  I wanted to have a look at them as I hadn't seen them yet.  The offending photo and screenshot was taken 2 days later so it's right there to see.  I wasn't checking up on her, we're pretty open about our personal stuff.  She knows my passwords for everything and I'm ok with that coz I actually have nothing to hide from her and I am 100% open about the communications I've had with people.  

&gt;Has she had emotional or even physical affairs?

Emotional yes, physical...not that I know of.

&gt;what if your wife was to flash her tits at these same people with your knowledge? Could you live with that?

I don't know to be honest.  But the thing is she doesn't even do that to me.  She has done more sexy things in the last 10 years to other people than she has to me (aside from having actual sex, but you know what I mean?).  She may very well get a thrill from doing it behind my back.

I need to deal with it asap.  I had a panic attack when I saw the evidence last night and I've been a mess all day.  The thing that really irks me is she did it while I was at my Dad's place looking after him.  He's in his last stages of terminal lung cancer and will be dead in the coming months.

Thank you for your reply, I appreciate it."
407,"Listen, this relationship isn't right for you.  You're different.

However, blogging your relationship problems is also a stupid idea in any situation and you need to own that many people would find that as grounds to break up.

She is in to a poly lifestyle, and you aren't comfortable with it.  This is totally ok.  I did poly for a while with an ex and it didn't work either.  Not everything works for everyone, and you two are fundamentally different on what you want in a relationship.  Nothing was ruined, you simply don't have the same relationship ideals.

You don't want to be ""friends"", you want her to be close enough to still be around and hope she misses what she had.  You can't be friends with someone you're in love with, it just doesn't work - ever.

It's over, and it's time to start the healing.  Get away from her as fast as you can, and stop communication with her. "
408,"Hey, I'm kind of like your husband. I obsess about something and then once I get it I move on.

He isn't going to like it but the best thing for him is for you to tell him you won't help him. He needs patience and a reality check. My uncle had a boat; he bought it in terrible condition while he was broke and only barely afforded to get it fixed up so he could sell it later. They are a total money pit and not worth it at all. 

It sounds like, if he's like me at all, his parents catered to his whims when he was a kid and never gave him any consequences for leaving behind an interest when it got too ""hard"" or whatever.

He says he wants you to work, but then says he doesn't want you to work. This is a guy who has no idea what he wants in life other than things he doesn't have right now.

You shouldn't have to ""pay him back"" for his supporting you while you're in school if he's the one that insisted you be reliant on him in the first place!

The important part: **I think you'd both be better off with other people that have more similar spending habits.** Counseling first, if he's up for it. He might not realize he has a problem and is acting like a child when his whims aren't immediately satisfied."
409,"This. All of this.
It would be a HUGE FUCK NO if it was me. Absolutely nonnegotiable! Kids come first.
Sounds like the owners just want to off load the dog cos they know it's high maintenance.
"
410,It would be inappropriate to even be friends with her. Cut contact immediately. 
411,"There is always someone better, richer, and more well-off than you are.  Always.  If you think about it, you could have a friend who is homeless, sick, divorced, or 100 other problems and they would look at YOU as the fortunate one.  

I've been through rough times, I know it is easy to get mad, sad, worried, and want to lash out at others.  These feelings are pointless and only harmful to yourself.  Try to focus on your own plan for your own life.  You're not living your friend's life, how do you get yourself in a position that makes you happy."
412,But OP would be literally asking not to discuss it anymore.
413,"Finding one dream kitty is hard enough. I grew up with a maine coon who has the most remarkable personality: extremely friendly, loving and sociable. (She liked to perch on my chest each night and purr before moving to the foot of the bed!) When I left for college, I missed my family, but I missed my cat more. ""Snickers"" was a ""family cat,"" and because my mom was equally attached to her, I wasn't allowed to take her to college.
&amp;nbsp;

When I started living on my own I began browsing shelters, but couldn't find the ""right"" cat for me. Then one day, I came across a maine coon kitten--with the same exact markings Snickers had, and the same outgoing, personable demeanor. I instantly knew she was the cat for me. 
&amp;nbsp;

I feel incredibly lucky to have found another cat with all of the traits I prize most. It's funny how alike they are, yet my memories with them, so different. 
&amp;nbsp;

Pets are family, and it sounds like you too were blessed with not one amazing cat, but two. Jayden may be a painful reminder for your husband, but giving him away would be a separate, additional loss for you. Tell your husband that. By giving away a cat you love and cherish, you'd only deepen the overall grief under your roof. 
&amp;nbsp;

A home without a cat is far too lonely, and a good cat is hard to find. "
414,"&gt; Oh yeah and he's a coke addict. 

Well, to be fair, she is too."
415,"It's a very bad sign that the business *needs* to pay their employees with a credit card. Why is it a good idea to prop up an unprofitable business? 

EDIT my father's death wasn't a surprise but it affected me far more and for far longer than I ever would have guessed. That's so common that pretty much every ethical financial professional will recommend you make as few decisions as possible for at least 6 months."
416,It's a huge problem. Dump the liar. 
417,"I don't understand why your son would be excluded even if he had a job. From what you wrote, this is supposed to be a week long trip for your daughter. Could your son not take those dates off work and still go on the trip? He can request those dates off when his workplace makes his first schedule. 

What is the real reason why you do not want him to go?"
418,"&gt;He also wants me to let him treat me like shit so he looks cool to his friends.

What the everloving fuck??? First off, what decent person thinks its cool to disrespect and degrade their soon-to-be wife? If my boyfriend treated me like shit in front of his friends they'd all tear him a new one.

&gt;But because I came with a son it's not enough

I'm getting the sense throughout your post that you feel like you need to somehow make up or compensate for your son being in your life, that somehow, being an awesome mom to an awesome little boy makes you ""less than."" That's ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. Sure, some people would prefer not to date someone with a child and that's their right, but that doesn't mean that single parents are less of a catch. If your fiance is bothered by his friends' comments about your status as a single mother, then 1) he has SHITTY friends, and 2) he's not ready to be a father and he doesn't deserve to be a father.

I would 100% call off this wedding. "
419,I don't think that's true. Many men marry single moms without feeling like they have to subjugate them in front of their friends. That has nothing to do with her being a single mom and everything to do with him being a douche.
420,That doesn't make it okay for him to control your time like this. You have a right to spend your free time doing things that you need/want to. You don't have to always be at his beck and call. 
421,"I don't know why we would demonize her. I don't plan to demonize you either. You made some big, big mistakes and it seems like you know where they lay. Could you speak to a counselor or psychologist about this once or twice? "
422,"That's not a good enough reason to stay with your fiance. It isn't fair to him to stay simply because ""you don't want to end up alone"". Sexual chemistry is important and you're thinking about someone else. 

End things with your fiance. Don't marry him. "
423,"I now realize my hang up about PDA and adventure has to do with his ED. I thought through him holding my hand or attempting to make out with me in public I wouldn't feel so bad about our dying bedroom and perhaps I could convince myself I'm OK with the lack of PIV sex. 

I don't want to kiss in public. I've never liked PDA. I don't want to go to bars or get drunk on the beach. I like going out to dinner and then watching a horror flick at home. That's enjoyable to both of us. 

It was misplaced hurt. We discussed it and he said he'd see a doctor. I'm overjoyed. "
424,"Wow. Score-keeping is *super* healthy in a relationship and you both seem to be doing it. Now we've upgraded to resentment, which is even worse. 

Basically, you've both started a count-down clock on your relationship. You need to hash this out with a third party, because your relationship is doomed as-is."
425,"This train is already heading to Divorce Town. If you want to hop off and walk back to Marriageville, you'd better be 100% committed and fully invested with every fiber of your being.

You're not. Such is life. Learn from this. "
426,"I saw it last night and I honestly cannot think of the part with nudity!

I find it so ironic that people are more concerned with nudity than violence. "
427,"&gt; Don't suggest. Tell. Suggesting implies that he can veto it.

Amen. As another PP said,

""Hubs, I'm not going to your practices any more- on Sunday mornings I will be training for my races.  I'm happy to go to a few of your actual games, but I'm not going to attend every one.""

Leave it at that.

And just stop answering the phone when he calls.
"
428,"Hmm, that's pretty vague. Care to expand on that thought?"
429,"I would be up for couples therapy, but I'm not sure about him.  "
430,Just because exceptions exist doesn't mean it's not a good rule.
431,That's actually a perfect response. 
432,That's not what I thought we were doing at all. 
433,"&gt; Then again, my literal BEST friend didn't attend my wedding. We still joke about it. I wasn't hurt.

Now you are seeing why not attending probably won't be the meltdown you worry it might be.  It's going to be her wedding day.  She's going to be focusing on her new husband and life together, not worrying about who couldn't make it.

Send a gift and a card.  Express your regret at being unable to attend.  Any real friend wouldn't have a problem with that.  "
434,"I understand being an introvert, and I also am a therapist who would consider herself introverted. But when I am facing a situation I want to talk about, I have friends to confide in, I have people to go see a movie with and grab food, I have people to cry to when I'm sad. However, I have few people I feel comfortable doing this with. I don't like big groups of people. But to put ALL of that energy into one person IMO is not healthy. Not everyone needs to be a party girl, but you need to be able to maintain a relationship with someone other than 1 person. 

I agree more with your last paragraph. You need to have a support system other than your bf. Only being open to 1 person in the world is not healthy, and to be honest if you only reach out to your supports if you break up that's pretty selfish. IMO not being open to having 1-2 friends and only caring about your bf is unhealthy."
435,"But that's his problem, and it's one he could fix by doing the same thing you seem to want to do -- making new friends."
436,"You're not wrong to not want to pay for and undergo the treatments. That's your choice. But your husband isn't wrong to want children, either. This might just be a dealbreaker."
437,"You've done what should have been done and talked to him about it, but that didn't work.  It may be the point to give him an ultimatum to either get his shit together and treat you with respect or you'll dump his ass. If that doesn't work then it's honestly just easier to find someone else who isn't going to treat you like shit. "
438,"You need to set boundaries with this girl. Whether you do it from the angle of ""let's be friends, I wanna help you be less creepy and fit in more"" or ""you need to stop I am creeped out"" doesn't really matter. It's up to you. But set a boundary with her. If you want a tool to have this conversation you can use ""when you..., I feel..., I need you to...., are you willing to..."" And fill in as you need. 

You shouldn't feel *responsible*, but you have options here to either be her friend or just tell her and you wouldn't be wrong either way, imo"
439,"Wow wow wow, slow your role. Your jumping to wild conclusion and your dealing with a grade 11 boy, meaning OP may not take what you say with a grain of salt and might just act on it causing more problems. 

A less doom and gloom sotuation is the two dating have a friend sharing all that shows your location (or he just asked another kid in school where OP lives). The boyfriend is a grade 11 boy, probably insecure, ya know due to puberty, highschool and shit, so he may be nervous or  jealous that his gf is at a popular boys house watching TV shows at night.

He could just be going over to see she's not there late/sizing up the competition. 

I'm not saying it's right, the creepy vibes are high but to say she's being abused is a wild assumption. And again OP is a grade 11 kid, pretty impressionable so you may be putting thoughts into his head that he will act on. "
440,"Continue investing in yourself. Have you been in any sort of counseling for your trauma experiences?

The problem seems to be that you look for men who will ""complete"" you, rather than looking for someone who will enhance your life. It's also possible that you seek out men who need fixing in order to feel like you're the one in control after growing up in an environment that took your power away completely. "
441,"Hey, here's a fun idea: don't take a bunch of drugs and then get behind the wheel of a car.  "
442,"Don't listen to this post. This is not about whether it was cheating or not. This is about how she feels hurt. She doesn't need more of a valid reason to feel this way. You should stop fighting over who is right or wrong, just talk it out with each other, let it go afterward. Agree that you both messed up, let go of any ego you have and just move on. "
443,"It's not right to pressure her not to. You like doing it and you aren't concerned about her. You're doing it because you want her to behave in a way that you have archetyped into a perfect girlfriend. That's what you call objectification. If you were here describing how you're concerned for her safety, concerned about the law, concerned about her health, even concerned about her grades, I'd give you way different advice but considering that all of those things are secondary to you, I think you're being selfish and should leave it alone. "
444,"You're still trying to change her. Don't try and change people. If you can't be happy with your SO as is, then move on. Otherwise, learn to accept that your gf likes to smoke weed occasionally. "
445,She likes you. It just took the booze to give her enough courage to say it.
446,"There's nothing to fall for, he told her exactly what's going on. OP is in denial."
447,"""If you are so happy, why are you hunting me down to tell me?"" This statement will take the wind out of her sails.  Because odds are, she is not happy, otherwise she wouldn't be trying to put on a show just for you."
448,Cheap roses that come in glass vials. They sell them at like Circle K and truck stops so people can get cheap way to smoke meth. Sorry I thought that was a common term
449,"I'm not sure you really need to do anything beyond following up with a text a few days later to see how she's holding up. Generally, you only send flowers and condolences to family members of the deceased, but if you really want to go above and beyond as a friend, you could send her a personalized care package of items to cheer her up, such as chocolate and a book or movie.

As for the wedding stuff, don't mention anything wedding related--not even innocently--unless she brings up flower arrangements, caterers, etc. first.  It sounds like she has a strong support system back home, and she will probably prioritize their assistance over yours to get through this, especially if they are all grieving for the deceased friend, too. Best to remain hands off in this situation."
450,"Sorry OP but what the heck is wrong with you?? 

You let some stranger, and a teenaged KID none the less, yell at your son??? And you just stand there letting it happen? 

She sits next to you guys half naked and sends your hubby sexy snaps and you sneakily delete her?? 

Where is your spine? Where is your sense of self? Where is your anger? You are letting a kid half your age roll right over you!! 

Talk to your husband and ask him what kind of loser he thinks you are that you should accept this kind of treatment from him?? Your husband should not be prioritizing a 19 yr old gf of his brother over you and his son!! 

Why aren't you angry he isn't doing his child care duties?? Why aren't you angry that he's ignored his father and husband responsibilities to go off and play single happy life??? 

Have a serious conversation with him - because this is all on your husband to correct - and if he would rather act like his brothers age than his own, then he's made his choice and you should make yours. Hopefully your husband realizes tho that even his younger brother will one day grow up and mature, and your husband will he left in the dust, alone. 

But goddam over anything else AT LEAST PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN WOMAN."
451,"&gt; He tells me I'm selfish and only care about myself.

He's got a fuckton of nerve, doesn't he? Let us assure you, *he* is the selfish one. He doesn't even care that his own dog is suffering! I think you need to get away from this asshat."
452,"So he won't even put in the effort to try and help this dog that he apparently loves too much to let go of. That poor dog :( I'm sorry, OP, some people just won't put in the effort. "
453,They may not have realized yet that they would have to limit it to engaged or married to stay within budget. I'm sure they didn't intentionally mislead you and once they decided on that rule they couldn't very well make an exception in case someone else who couldn't bring a plus one found out. Planning a wedding is complicated. 
454,"He has no idea how hard it is to be pregnant. Truly doesn't. Even *I* am surprised at how physically draining it has been. On a good day, I'm still achey and exhausted yet I still manage to do it all. If I complain that I'm tired he scoffs and rolls his eyes. "
455,"Yeah this is weird. I don't know why he'd go into gory detail without being asked. 

Also- so what if you are jealous? Like, if my BF describes a wonderful, juicy burger with crispy french fries for lunch, yeah I'm gonna be jealous of that tasty treat. Why wouldn't you be jealous of him describing some wonderful sexual escapade? "
456,Except that also doesn't explain why she would be angry the next morning like you said happens when she's asleep when you get home and doesn't wake up. It seems more like some sort of control issue. 
457,"Your brother has a poor romantic track record, making bad decisions in choosing a partner, failing to build a healthy relationship, and cheating on his wife.  Maybe he has learned lessons from all this and has gone through a lot of personal growth, but maybe he's just somebody who makes a lot of bad romantic decisions and will continue to do so.  

As for what to tell your family, I think you should try to make two points.  1) The kids are innocent of all of this, and you think it is beneficial to stay in their lives, which means getting along with both of their parents.  2) You disagree with your brother's choices, but you love your brother and you aren't going to shun him just because somebody else told you to.  

But mostly, I think you should try to avoid talking about the matter with the rest of your family for at least a year.  Eventually things will settle down into a new status quo.  If you come out strong in defense of your brother and his girlfriend, you stir up more drama centering around you. Better to stay out of the family discussion about the whole mess as much as possible. "
458,"Given that YOU live at YOUR place and are a guest at his, wouldn't a fair split be that he does the chores at his house and you do the chores at yours?"
459,&gt;He paid a lot of my tuition to get me my masters so I can get my dream job.
460,"Your mom wanted you to write thank you notes (when you were a child) and you said you'd rather not have any than do that?

Why? "
461,"Come on OP, like the other poster said, get some self respect. Fuck this guy who mocked you to his buddies. You're way too young to waste your time with a jerk like that. You should be embarrassed that he shared that info with everyone. Seriously forget about him. "
462,"thanks.


FYI, my nutritionist and doctor are both pushing peanut butter as the best non-meat protein alternative.  "
463,It's really sad that you would rather spend time with your friends who you see everyday more than your girlfriend who bends over backwards for you. I hope she realizes pretty soon that she deserves to be treated better than this. 
464,"Calling her a muse is at least presenting to her that she's high on a pedestal to you. Whether or not that was your intention, that's how it's going to come across. There is a balance you need to learn in dating. Not being self deprecating, but also understanding how you're coming off, and making sure you want to come off the way you want to. 


It comes across as very nice guy. Like you're avoiding sex with her because you think you know what she wants better than her. And presenting that you want something deep and meaningful, disregarding her wishes, even though she has made it clear she just wants sex. So yea, sorry bud, but you come off as very Nice Guy. "
465,"Five months.  And she wants to move into your swanky luxury condo with the cat she knows makes you sick.

This is a mistake on many levels.   

Why are you even considering this madness?

At 5 months, you don't even really know this person yet.  Well, except I guess you do know she cares more about getting her way than your health.   

"
466,"Yeah I agree with you. BF and I are on a fitness journey where I track my calories and stick to 1300/Day unless I do cardio. BF has a much more generous calorie limit than I, so I just have to live with that sometimes he can snack and I can't. Tracking calories in an app makes it so much easier to limit yourself though! "
467,[deleted]
468,"I guess I don't really see the point of uninviting her at this time? Like, she sounds incredibly busy, but she's not actively going out of her way to be mean to you. I can understand that your feelings are hurt that she's not as attentive to you, but uninviting her is a friendship ending move. Something I read when I was planning my own wedding - it's the most important day *for you* but it's just another event for your guests. "
469,"Men talk a lot about sex. On sites like Reddit, you get the impression all they want is sex. There are jokes about girls saying no, endless porn subs, creepy comments on any picture of a girl, endless wanking jokes... if you haven't been with actual human guys before, it's easy to believe men want sex all the time. I had the same issue. I'd been told men needed no foreplay, would sometimes cum in under a minute, would stay with abusive women because they were hot/good in bed, so when my boyfriend turned down a blowjob/sex/anal I took it personally. 

I mean, obviously I was wrong. Sometimes you just aren't in the mood, or you're feeling ill or you just ate or you're tired. It took me a while to get that, because it went against everything I'd been told. 

I say sit her down and tell her 'men don't always want sex. That's a myth. Today I didn't want sex for {reason}. I'm still very attracted to you and I'm not cheating- I just didn't want to have sex at that exact moment in time. It's not acceptable to talk to me like that or react in that way. I'm allowed to say no, and you need to respect that.'

If she reacts negatively to that, you'll know she's just selfish and rude. However, if she hadn't shown any other signs of being awful, don't give up hope just yet.

PS: I'm so sorry about your dog, man. Hope he's got all the tennis balls and treats he wants wherever he might be now. Rainbow bridge is a really nice poem if you haven't been recommended it already."
470,That's why these kinds of things tend to be called red flags. They're warning you of bigger problems/underlying issues.
471,"Thanks for updating us. And a late chag sameach, as well!"
472,What ever could possibly go wrong!
473,"I'll preface this by saying that I don't know you or what makes you happy, so this is all just my opinion. Listen to it as much or as little as you want. 

I mean, you do you, but I get the feeling you'll end up pretty sad and lonely in the long term. Not that I have experience, just that having 3 kids with a man you don't love while sexually serving him multiple times a day doesn't sound like my personal idea of happiness. "
474,"Once again, while this is likely true, do not believe random redditor memecitydreams about it just because he said it. Whether or not you can get out of it, it's almost certainly going to depend on your state and the exact terms of the lease. Consult your lawyer. It's very possible that you only owe money to the landlord, and not if he paid it. Generally leases specify that you pay the landlord each month, but not which tenant pays which percentage. There might be an issue if you promised to pay him 50%, but again, it's murky and all depends on your state. Get a lawyer, or at the very least the legaladvice subreddit, don't listen to people here.

Oh and absolutely do not meet with him. Things you say can only be used against you. More than likely he doesn't actually go through with anything."
475,"I'm surprised at the genuine support I've received from reddit. I was afraid it would turn nasty or just be repetitive ""leave him"" responses. I've received a lot of great advice and I'm definitely taking it all to heart. "
476,Smiling typically indicates happiness. He was with you in the car driving to your home together. I'd assume he's happy.

482,"If you can't plan a wedding without asking 6-8 people to help you with minor details how can you get a mortgage on a house (omg it's such a pain) or one day when you have kids, juggle life? Kid A has to go to soccer at 8-12 and kid B has practice at 9 and then a game at 10-1, it takes half an hour to get to Kid B's event and Kid A's event is in town but OH god okay Kid A needs to finish that stupid poster and it has to be done before dinner because grandma is coming to drop off those casserole pans I need for a Sunday, but maybe SHEeeee can come early and, wait, when did husband say his car was in the shop because then he can use his moms car and then if she's here....

Ugh. "
483,"Um, you were scared of your husband--this is definitely not something to ignore. 

How does he handle it after these episodes? Does he pretend they don't happen? Apologize profusely? Has he ever acknowledged that he has anger issues?"
484,"I agree with the other commenters that your going there was an overreaction, and your response to his text is an overreaction. He's a grown man, who, in response to your offer to come take care of him, said no. You can't be mad at him for not being there when you unilaterally decided to take off work and drive over. 

As for the loop issue- he clearly wasn't expecting to need to update you on every development, hence his frustrated text about going to his mom's. Try to chill out!"
485,"I mean, fortunately the requirement for probable cause to break up with somebody is a lot lower than to conduct a raid into somebody's home for narcotics!

In either case, if you're suspicious enough to snoop into your SO's personal shit, either you have your reasons/suspicions or the relationship is on the outs already (or probably should be). My take on it, at least. "
486,"I don't know, I'm not you. Just have no illusions of pulling both of these things off. If this goes long distance, you absolutely need to break up. Maintaining a serious adult relationship while in medical school is borderline suicidal in and of itself. My doctor friends (who are admittedly overachievers in a field of overachievers), had precious little time for relationships, friendships, or even anything resembling recreation for YEARS while in med school and residency. If you are that type of person (which I think you are), it will wholly consume your every thought and action for the next few years. 

"
487,"Uhhh ... he doesn't drive, he doesn't help out, he's not affectionate. He's manipulative in that he keeps talking you into staying with him when you clearly want out (although, your fault too - you're easy to manipulate). He doesn't sound like that great of a person, and you sound like a pushover.

Rip the bandaid, and leave."
488,"You cannot get pregnant any day of the month. There needs to be an egg present for conception to happen, and that only happens once per cycle. "
489,"This isn't true, they call it 3LOL for a reason, you literally don't even need it but we still do it.  Something is odd, and girl don't feel bad, and I would go no contact on his ass."
490,Yeah I think that might be the best path. We have family near by so it wouldn't be a 'wasted' trip if we end up finding nothing. It might do her some good. 
491,"It wouldn't be his friend because said friend wouldn't be allowed to HAVE friends. 

I think that makes it even worse. "
492,"He sounds impulsive and childish and not a person to have children with. If you want to leave, I don't think there's anyone here who would tell you otherwise - cut your losses and get gone."
493,"And so what if it does? Failing to see how this is a problem. 

Unless by ""weird"" he means ""disgusting"" in which case it's going to be tricky."
494,"No, but they can tell you WHERE to 'pass'.

&gt; The one I was in is used for clients/guests

Sounds like staff are fully aware they should be using other restrooms."
495,"When choosing a partner, one of the important long-term quality of life issues is how they interact with your social sphere.  You viewyour girlfriend as somebody who gets in unnecessary arguments, throws tantrums, and who creates drama.  Do you really want to be partnered with that?  Can your relationship overall survive the fact that you have little respect for your girlfriend's interpersonal skills?  

Have you ever told your girlfriend that you think she was in the wrong in her disagreement with your friends, and that the tantrum was completely inappropriate?  That's a conversation you need to have with her if you want to try to actually resolve these issues.  "
496,"&gt; But I still feel like I'm focusing on all the good/what we could have been.

This is common, and very natural. Often short relationships are strangely harder to get over than long ones because you haven't seen all the ugly sides of someone yet and you're so much closer to the beginning excitement, so those memories are fresher in your mind. You absolutely did the right and mature thing to end it since you two wanted different things, and he acted like a baby about it so that's a bullet dodged.

All you can really do is distract yourself. Date other people, go out with friends, engage in your hobbies. This will fade, probably more quickly than you expect. Also definitely keep reminding yourself of his childish reaction - in his late 20s and can't handle a polite rejection when he didn't even want to get serious in the first place? Yikes."
497,"Yeah, I would NOT want that guy around my kid. If I had a kid, which I don't. But still.

498,"I don't know what state they're in or if the husband or the estate was listed as the beneficiary of the policy (it sounds like the husband is the listed beneficiary) but, life insurance policy benefits generally pay to a named beneficiary and can't be called for estate debts or taxes in the US.

Source: I'm a licensed life insurance agent in Michigan."
499,"&gt;The ignorance thing does spread into other issues. Like politics. He hates them and knows nothing about them. Can't hold a conversation about them. His one political opinion is that the government is fake and being controlled by others.

This would 100% be a dealbreaker for me. This is only my personal opinion and you are a totally different person, but I just want you to know that having this preference is not crazy. It's very important to me that partner cares about the world and the people around them, and part of that is being aware of politics and how it affects us. They don't need to be an expert (I'm certainly not either).

&gt;Now that I think about it, bf doesn't have many hobbies. I'm his hobby pretty much. All free time is spent with me unless I'm out with my friends. He calls me often because he's bored. He gets off work at 2pm then just goes home.

I think this is the stand-out issue in this post. It's not at all unreasonable to expect your partner to be their own person with their own interests. Depending entirely on you for entertainment is what a 3-year-old does (and that's the age where parents have to really actively encourage independent activities). Personally I would not want to date a 3-year-old."
500,"HOLD UP.

He didn't even LISTEN to it?
He threw it in the trash?

and..... then you actually slept with him, because he wanted it (you did not)?!

OP, get outta there. You can do so so so much better. 
Get ouuuuutta there. "
501,"&gt; I don't really understand how I'm passing responsibility to him

Because by your own description you're getting mad at HIM for you not going to the gym, when in reality, making sure you go to the gym is your responsibility, not his. 

Same thing with getting up earlier before work. If you want to get up earlier, you do it. 

&gt;I also don't understand why it's an unreasonable expectation for me to expect him to say ""ok you're right, go do the thing""

It's an unreasonable expectation because he has demonstrated repeatedly that it is not going to happen.

I mean, the sun COULD rise in the west tomorrow, but that has never happened, so expecting it would be an unreasonable expectation.

Your BF has demonstrated that he is NOT going to be your personal trainer or time-management coach.

If you want to work out or make better use of your time, you're going to need to do it yourself. 

&gt;in the end I'm giving in to him

Ding ding ding!

As soon as you stop doing that, your problem will be solved."
502,"If it's that important for him to share his wife's name, why won't he change his? I'd tell him you won't marry him til he agrees to change his name to yours. "
503,"Honestly, after two years, that's when the planning for a future starts - and the first step is usually making sure you're in the same zip code. Are you planning to move out of NYC eventually? If not, how exactly do you see this relationship progressing? It honestly sounds like you're not ready for the next step and after a year of dating, that's not a good sign. "
504,"&gt; I also discovered that I am eligible to get in state tuition to University of Hawaii, which would honestly be the dream place for me to live, and has a program for Environmental Design which I am super interested in.

#GO!

If your relationship is as strong as you believe then you will be okay. If it's not then it's better you find this out now than several years from now, after making many educational and familial sacrifices."
505,OP needs to spell out everything here in writing for her- bullet points even- so when she approaches grandma she doesn't get flustered and lose what she needs to say.
506,"I recommend you just do some research about relationships. Read some articles, maybe a book or two, or look up website reviews. Sure you're going to get some good tips on here but you need more than two paragraphs to really turn your life around."
507,"&gt; I understand the feeling of wanting certain things when special between you two.

This isn't really reasonable when you have a young kid, separated parents or not. When a kid get really into something they want to play it all the time and show everyone they know about it. Like if you give a young kid some pokemon cards, for example, they aren't just going to keep them in their pocket and only play with them with the person who bought them.The vast majority of kids, when they find something new and fun, want to share it with everyone.

If OP is immature enough that he can't handle his son wanting to share his joy for a toy with other people, then he is not a mature or reasonable parent and he needs to get over himself."
508,"&gt;In short, her knowing that you're thinking of her through your words and actions will help heaps :)


Thanks :-) This was why I came to r/relationships. 

I just am worried that this will bring an extra level of complication to the pregnancy and want to make sure that I am completely prepared for it. Its early days but I know we will get through this together. 

You mentioned that you had GD for your first, did you have another pregnancy where the ugly GD did not make an appearance?

Also thanks for the advice on where to give birth- we are currently exploring all our options, we don't live in either of our birth countries so healthcare is an issue.  "
509,I don't understand why you didn't physically go see her yourself? I mean 2 months? For a 5 year relationship? It seems like you checked out a while ago as well.
510,"Everybody grieves completely differently and just because his father is able to function normally does not mean that his mother has to function normally. Comparing two people grieving just doesn't make sense. She does need therapy and it is not good to ignore your children because of grief, but not everybody is able to deal with grief in a healthy way on their own. "
511,The double standard there did cross my mind. Like she is a boring prude if she doesn't play or drink and if she plays she is a cheating slut. Lesson learned avoid drinking and not drinking with those two. Don't see them at all.
512,That's because mushrooms aren't food. It's the people that eat them that have a problem. 
513,"I'm pretty sure there are tons of actors and actresses who have entire careers without any sex scenes, so I don't really agree with that first part"
514,"Do not go out of your way to meddle and cause a drama unless you are pretty certain they are supposed to be on monogamous terms with their partner. It's a tough one, but you can't go witch hunting everyone who's out of place, because as you say, you don't know the score."
515,"This isn't petty, you're in an abusive relationship. "
516,"The good memories are part of why it's so hard to leave abusers in the first place: if they were always monsters, then you'd never get involved.  You want to believe that the times when the two of you had a normal-to-good relationship were more ""real"" than the abuse, because you know that's what relationships are supposed to be.  The other stuff is still baffling and painful and hard to focus on for too long.

If you're really struggling with this, you should probably take it to an actual therapist, but I think it might be helpful to stop trying to counteract the memories and just acknowledge them instead.  They were things that happened, and it's okay to remember them fondly despite all the bad stuff that happened around them, but all of that is over now.  Today is a new day, and a chance to make new ""golden memories.""  Look into ""mindfulness techniques"" and see if any of those resonate with you."
517,"So this guy somehow has nowhere else to go but live with you after only three months of dating (what would he have done if you weren't in the picture?) And then proceeds to reward your hospitality by going out of his way to make sure he has eliminated all of the alone time you expressly asked him for. He uses emotional manipulation to guilt you into spending time outside of the house with his friends when you don't want to. And now he's trying to emotionally balckmail you by saying moving apart is breaking up? Insane. You both have children and you've only been dating for two years. Living apart should be the standard at this point. *Maybe* you should be *starting* to think about moving in together if everything's going well. But it's not! He's given you no reason to believe this will be a good situation for you at all. (Not to mention your poor daughter) Everything is on his terms. I mean, honestly, he sounds like dead weight. I would just tell him he needs to find a new place and delete his number."
518,"&gt; Sounds like they have enough room outside and is a perfect example of how to teach your kids how to be responsible.

Yeah, but imagine the consequences of irresponsibility.  They are toddlers.  They are going to mess up and be irresponsible.  The penalty for that shouldn't be maiming/death.  "
519,"Here's the thing: If you say something innocuous and he's terribly hurt by it, that's on him. If he's so insecure or anxious that he can read an indictment of his character into everything you say to him, he needs professional help. The solution isn't for you to just walk on eggshells around him forever, which is kinda what he's forcing you to do when he has a meltdown like this. "
520,"Yes, he is allowed to be angry. But the component he's missing is that adults are still responsible for managing their own anger and expressing it appropriately.  Of course, people are not robots and nobody's going to act perfectly 100% of the time, but if you have a *pattern* of lashing out then you need to figure out how to get a grip on that.  It's a bad sign that your BF blew up when you suggested addressing the pattern."
521,"You're an adult now. Crying ""BS"" amounts to exactly jack shit in the real world. If you don't like it, grow up and move out."
522,"I'd say you're definitely justified in worrying about him doing something major during the wedding or reception. Eve absolutely shouldn't be the one to suffer because Tom is a jackass! But it sounds like your fiancé has some...issues...when it comes to Tom and his shitty behavior. Does he often excuse/dismiss this kind of thing, or is it just when his cousin is involved? 

I hope Eve is tracking of all these incidents and keeping screenshots of any harassing texts. She may need to pursue a restraining order, given that Tom escalated things at the party. "
523,Guy here. Totally unacceptable. 
524,I'd suggest trying therapy as soon as it's an affordable option for you. 
525,I don't get this. You envision yourself with a future SO so that implies you envision yourself having sex in the future and not like dying alone as a virgin or whatever. So like... just have sex with the next girl you start dating?
526,Wow so many insecure people in here.
527,...you thought the sub would blame him so to counter that you blamed him yourself? 
528,"The fact that it's a person he knows (used to know) makes it feel a little sketchy, though. I enjoy porn, my boyfriend enjoys porn, and him getting himself off by himself doesn't bother me at all. But if he were getting off to someone he knew, I would be uncomfortable with it."
529,Find someone who will honor you as a person. Talking over you means he doesn't care about who you are. 
530,An owner that doesn't keep up with vet visits and offers to just get rid of the dog because it's old is not a caring or responsible owner.
531,"Haha, we're revisiting the topic when she's two. :) I wanted to get into the swing of motherhood first (even before all this!)."
532,"My gfs dad's a doctor and her mum's a nurse and as a general rule of thumb they didn't treat people they knew. I don't know if that's a hospital specific rule or just a general rule though. I think you have to keep in mind that likelihood of you bumping into him is very low (him going to hospital at the exact time of your shift, at the exact ward you're working in and walking by at the exact moment) but if you see him, keep your head down, don't say hi and walk on. Tell one of your colleagues or head nurses the situation in private and ask if you can move ward or swap wards with another nurse but they'll have experience and know what to do"
533,"Okay I came here to say maybe give him the benefit of the doubt because it could just be something that he'd forgotten about, but he viewed it two days ago and is still keeping it. Even if he viewed it just to see what it was, I think it's really disrespectful to both you AND the ex that he didn't get rid of it. I would be pretty skeeved out if my ex kept even a nude photo of me without my face in it, let alone a sex tape. She trusted him to take this video, and now a stranger has (accidentally) seen it. 

Anyway, all that aside, you have to talk to him. If it really went down the way you described, then you found it while using his computer for a legitimate reason, so it wasn't exactly hidden. It will also eat away at your trust for him if you stay silent. Don't go into the conversation with anger or accusations, but tell him that you found something on his computer that you two need to discuss. He will almost certainly know what you're talking about. 

Leave the question open-ended and DO NOT mention the ex at all. Just something like, ""hey, is there a reason you kept this video? I was pretty surprised to find it,"" and his reaction will be telling. If he gets super defensive and angry, and tries to turn it around on you, that's not a good sign. I think it's very reasonable to ask him to get rid of it. If there's pushback on that, that's not a good sign either. Keeping memories is healthy and not a problem, but keeping sexual content of someone that you used to bang is very different. In addition, it's upsetting his current partner. The biggest issue is that this erodes your trust in him. Six months isn't a very long time, but it's longer than a week. 

Just keep your cool, and don't let him gaslight you into thinking that you're being a crazy jealous girlfriend. You're making a reasonable request. This is a shit situation, OP. I'm really sorry."
534,"&gt; This means OP's GF will be able to dictate everything, meaning where they live, where they eat, what kind of things they buy. It may sound like a good deal but in reality it is very tiring. 

No, it doesn't mean that at all. A healthy relationship calls for communication of desires. If their needs don't sync up, then OP can walk away at any time. "
535,"C'mon man, this is really simple. Don't engage with them with anything other than work-related things. Don't socialize. If you need to ask them something work-related, keep it professional. If they refuse to cooperate, bring it up with superiors. Don't express anger, frustration, or sadness. Be professional &amp; upbeat. You need to show that you aren't bothered with their antics. You need to make them look like morons each time they pull something. The more you do this, the more they'll be frustrated and maybe try to escalate their behavior. Eventually they'll screw up, and that's when karma will bite them in the ass. You do realize they're not actually happy with each other, right? They're bonding mutually through bullying. Bide your time, be patient, and you'll pull through. 

Edit: Typo!"

537,"You've been chatting online for a couple weeks and he's almost twice as old as you. Don't be so worried about whether or not he is into you, this could never work out realistically. "
538,"Hey OP. I'm sorry for you. I think the money is a symptom though. Because if the money hadn't come through, you guys would have had to do something else to deal with this. I understand that logically your husband should get to writing checks and ""Fix"" all of this but I don't think it will do what you want.

Because the money was a surprise. You guys needed a plan b anyway. The fact that there wasn't one (or a viable one?) really means you guys need to talk so much more.

This is a tough situation but the money isn't going anywhere any time soon. If you can bear to wait a little, try some counselling together and alone to try and deal with the underlying issues. If that doesn't work or you don't want to, then there is always the nuclear divorce option.

But please don't let the money change how you would act. Pretend for a little while as if the money isn't there and do whatever you would have had to do anyway. Plus, your husband is no doubt still grieving. Tough for both of you.

Good luck "
539,"&gt; I'm also scared something happened to her at a younger age that made her develop an almost hatred for sexual activity.

Yikes, do not ever say anything remotely like this to her. Asexuality is a valid sexuality and does not necessarily have to stem from abuse. It's very insulting to imply that something terrible must have happened to her in order to make her Asexual."
540,"Objectively, I have to side with her. You are making way too much of this. "
541,"I strongly suspect that your girlfriend actually *does* mind that you're friends with this coworker, but she is saying nothing because she doesn't want to be seen as ""controlling"". Last time she drew a perfectly reasonable boundary (ie, ""Please don't show your breasts to a coworker,"") you reacted by running *directly* to that coworker and involving them in the argument. You didn't use an outside opinion to inform yours, you treated coworker as though they had an equal say in what was a very private argument. 

You proved to your girlfriend that you're not actually on her team. 

You keep asking ""how can we move forward"", you're not really asking, ""How can I make my girlfriend feel more comfortable"". If you want to repair the damage you cause to the relationship, you need to start behaving as though you're on her team. That means making sacrifices. That means *voluntarily* ending all out-of-work contact with your coworker. Don't do it because ""girlfriend said so"". Don't do it ""to make girlfriend happy"". Do it because ""I love my girlfriend and I want to demonstrate that she comes first in my life. I am on her team and am willing to put her needs before my own in circumstances such as these.""

Apologise to your girlfriend for betraying her trust. Don't add, ""I didn't realise it was wrong,"" or ""I didn't think you would react the way you did,"" or ""it obviously upsets you, so I won't do it again."" Take responsibility. ""I fucked up."" Then *ask her*, ""How can I make you feel more secure in our relationship?"" Rebuilding trust takes a *long* time, and it isn't evidently clear whether you have put any effort into rebuilding the trust or whether you've just hoped that her feelings would ease in time. But rebuilding trust takes effort and time, and you need to put the hard yards in if you want your relationship to thrive.

"
542,So you're not attracted to someone. And you don't see yourself having a relationship with them (non physical attraction wise)...but you have sex with them? I honestly can't understand how people do that. Not judging. Just genuinely confused.

544,"Wow your husband is so in the wrong here! I'm pretty, so I would just make tons and tons of noise in the morning at 6 when you wake up with your son. And therefore waking both your husband and all his friends up every time they come home drunk.

The non-petty way would be to sit down and talk about it when you're both calm. It's not ok, to have people wake your child up or be in your house that late into the morning of one of you is not comfortable with it. Both of you live there and both of you deserve to be comfortable in your house. Is he inconsiderate of your needs and comfort in other areas of your life?"
545,"No, this is terrible advice. She mentioned in a comment way down, her fiancé was yelling racist insults at her sister's bf in her sister's apartment at a party in front of their friend group because he didn't get his way. He will keep arguing and shouting for HOURS if people don't agree with him... his friends have left him over this... her sister is actually totally right! She shouldn't be accepting the fiancé at all because that would accepting racism towards her own boyfriend. Her sister is being aggressive about it because OP is trying to sweep her fiancé' racism under the rug because he's manipulated her into thinking it's no big deal. 

Of course the sister is going to ostracize him, that's what you do with a racist. You don't invite them to parties so they can continue being racist towards your loved ones, and you definitely don't stay quiet about it if your sister is about to marry a racist who will chase all her friends away with his aggressiveness. 

The fact that OP didn't mention that in the post and didn't admit to it until she was asked hundreds of times speaks volumes.   "

This isn't to say that smart parents don't have smart children - they do. It's just that their children are rarely as smart because of regression to the mean. Essentially, your father was likely a positive outlier from his genetics. You are closer to the expectation. You cannot live up to your parent's expectations, because, like many smart people, they implicitly assume that you are capable of what they are capable of. You need to work on minimizing their adverse effect on your life. Keep in mind that there is much, much more to life than being smart. "

556,"I'm hijacking this comment because you got so much ""just do it anyway!""-advice.

You are so worried, and so embarrassed. And it's so easy to sit behind a screen and tell you not to be, but no one here lives in your head.

So here's a possible script for your dad:

""Dad, I'm about to tell you something that's very embarrassing for me, and which makes me really worried about how disappointed you will be. I haven't been training for the 5k, and at this point I've decided not to do it. Please don't try to convince me otherwise.""

(A possible bonus solution, ONLY if you feel it might be good for you. I don't know your situation, so I don't know if this is a good idea: ""I won't run in the actual race, but would you go with me on a 5k jog just the two of us? I haven't trained, so it will have to be a mic of walking and jogging, but I really need some positive memories around this for motivation.)"
557,"Wow, I have self harm scars and I'm in a wedding and I don't think there is a tactful way to ask your friend to cover up her body because it's so upsetting it would make your guests uncomfortable. 

Either make all the bridesmaids wear some sort of cover up, or just accept your friend how she is. You could also hope your guests aren't absurd enough to gawk and be rude to someone because they have scars. "
558,I can't believe you and your fiancee would treat his sister like that.  She struggled with mental illness for YEARS and FINALLY has the courage to show her battle scars and you want to single her out and shame her because you're embarrassed. You knew this was going to be a potential problem so you shouldn't have asked her to be part of your wedding.  Theres no good way to go about it but I recommend telling you FSIL so she knows just what kind of awful person she's dealing with.  You wouldn't ask a cancer patient to wear a wig would you?

574,"In some areas, you are allowed to own one with a license, but it comes along with a LOT of regulations around their ownership.  If it IS legal where he lives, he probably still requires a permit and would have had to buy it from a reputable breeder.  It can't have been taken from the wild (even if it was abandoned).  It MUST have a suitable enclosure, which includes both land and water sections. 

According to the recommendations in a 2013 publication by the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, enclosures for mature crocodilians should be twice as long and wide as the animal's length. For example, even an 8-foot-long female requires a 16-by-16 enclosure.

About one-half of this space should feature a pond deep enough for the animal to submerge completely. Because of their immense bulk and incredible strength, you must construct the cage from resilient materials, such as concrete blocks, poured concrete and chain-link fence. As alligators are often housed outside, it is imperative that the cage not only keeps the animal inside, but that you ensure unauthorized people cannot get into the cage.

Letting it roam in the house is absolutely not legal anywhere, as far as I can tell.  

Keeping the enclosure and pond clean will require considerable amounts of labor, and ideally, the installation of a drainage system for the pond. He would also need to include heat lamps if the local temperatures are not appropriate.

Feeding the alligator is also regulated. While it may be easy enough to obtain feeder fish, crickets and rodents to feed a young alligator, feeding an adult is an entirely different matter. His alligator is an adult and he would need to find a source for rabbits, nutria, chickens or similar food items.

Some municipalities also require liability insurance (duh).  You should talk to your local wildlife department and find out what the laws are.  You could then take those to him and make him fulfilling ALL of those laws a requirement of you moving in, IF you are willing to move your children there if the alligator is properly contained outside in a gated and locked enclosure.

If he's failing on a bunch of those fronts, then he is not properly caring for his pet and it should be removed from him."
575,"Oh fuck this guy. Leave him immediately. Thank goodness you're long distance and your lives aren't further entangled. Non-consensual choking? WtF. So much no. Infinite amounts of no. Just because he's smiling and laughing when he calls you a baby doesn't mean he's joking. It just means he's smiling and laughing at your fear and panic. He enjoys it. He enjoys upsetting you and making you panic. 

&gt; Last time he started to talk about this, I told him to stop because I know I'm going to get upset, and he persisted and accused me of manipulating him into apologizing for something he doesn't see as wrong by crying when this topic comes up.

And on top of all that sadistic behavior, he uses this tactic of pushing you too far then playing victim when you finally crack. The something he doesn't see as wrong- it isn't just his terrible anti-semitic views - he just plain doesn't see it as wrong to make you cry. 

Given the history with your dad, and given that you think this relationship with this guy is something you should bother working on instead of ending - you should get yourself into some therapy."
576,"I can see that from their point of view. He pays rent and seems to be grateful to have a roof over his head. Meanwhile their daughter is begging and fighting with them to let him stay in her room, yet he's not supporting that idea. He's the ""good kid"" in this situation. "

578,"A lot of posters are rushing in with asexuality but I think, based on your post, that it might be more of a cultural issue. I am a first gen american and came from a very traditional and religious background. When I was younger, I had a lot of hang ups about sex. I didn't understand the appeal, it kinda even repulsed me. I realise now that it was just the taboo nature surrounding sex and virginity in our culture that made me feel that way.

It took a lot of time and reconditioning but I'm a lot more comfortable with sexuality now, even if I'm still pretty modest and shy. It's going to be a long journey of self-discovery for your girlfriend. Reading books on the subject and seeing a therapist might help. She might find out that she's just scared of sex because of her traditional upbringing. Or maybe she *is* asexual. All in all there isn't much you can do except offer your support as a friend.

"
579,"Honestly, I can see both sides here, but since it is you who is here rather than your wife, I'll suggest a few things you may not have thought about:

* You say your wife suffers from chronic pain. Travelling with chronic pain can be miserable and can even cause some difficulties as some countries don't allow certain pain meds into the country (e.g. Japan and codeine). I can see why spending large amounts of time travelling may not be that appealing to her.

* Would you actually be able to live in the countries you're thinking about? You're not yet of retirement age in most places, and if I'm reading it correctly neither of you work due to disability? Some countries may not offer the same financial support to people in your situation that you can get in Germany, and if you support yourself on savings, keep in mind that somewhere like Australia has a very high cost of living. Also, a lot of countries are not going to be keen on allowing permanent immigrants of working age who aren't going to bring in-demand skills to the workforce. So will you get a visa? Can you support yourselves?

* Would it really be practical to be in these countries in your old age? The extreme heat of Australian summers can be difficult for older people, as can the serious humidity in Asian countries. You may still end up confined to the house with air conditioning. On top of that, as you age, the long flights home will become impossible and you won't be able to visit family. 

* You mention somewhere in comments that she's already spent much of her life travelling because of you and wants to settle down. Do you appreciate her having done this? How much have you sacrificed to have a lifestyle that she likes?

As I said, I absolutely understand your side as well, but I thought I'd present some of the issues I can see from your wife's point of view."
580,"If you do respond, I would phrase it in a way so as to give no apologies. Don't put yourself on the defensive saying you didn't know you were in a relationship. Because you weren't, ha. 

After he ghosted you, at some point you came to the conclusion yourself that the relationship was over, and you came to terms with that. That's when it ended. Not your fault he gave nothing but radio silence. You've done nothing wrong.

If it were me replying I would say something disdainful like

""That's hilarious! You actually think we're still a couple???""

""Are you fucking kidding me - this relationship ended over two months ago. You should know - you killed it."""
581,"&gt;Do you think that they were fooling around and shit when we were still together

Yes. Make it a break UP. "
582,You are being petty. You avoid them yourseklfbut want them there for the party...
583,"This. She probably doesn't really want your brother. She just wants to be number one. She can't stand her place is being threatened by someone that might be viewed as ""superior"". 

She quintessentially acting like that girl who doesn't want to date her ""best guy friend"" but doesn't want him to date anyone else either because she's be losing the attention. Not OK. Your brother deserves this happiness.

She needs to grow up and talk to about this maturely. 

Is she feeling extra threatened because she is insecure about her appearance with the pregnancy and all?"
584,Offering to pay if it looks like its broken is a pretty normal reaction. Getting upset and asking them to pay for a seemingly broken thing isn't much of an overreaction. It's to be expected. If she said she was sorry and told her bf that if it was broken she would replace it I think he'd be a lot less upset. He even apologized for snapping a bit. She's being way too sensitive over this thing and she doesn't take much responsibility.
585,You've already been through one relationship with a cheater and you know how horrible it is.  This man has shown you twice that he can't be trusted.  Be good to yourself and your children and break up with him.
586,"&gt; She told me that she was into degradation (sexually) which makes me think she might actually just be a worthless horrible person

What the fuck, dude. 

One second you're ""crazy about her"" and the next you're calling her a worthless horrible person? 

I think you need to do some self reflection here. It's not healthy to be so attached to someone you've only known for two weeks. It's not normal to agree to exclusivity *on your first date*. It's not normal or healthy to be talking about ""falling in love"" with each other within the first two weeks of dating. It's terribly unkind to call someone worthless and horrible for their sexual interests. *Especially* someone you claim to care about. 

This relationship is not worth continuing, don't waste your time. What's your dating history like? You can find someone you're compatible with, but not if you rush into exclusivity with every person that you've been on **one date** with. Compatibility is a complex thing and your eagerness to find a long-term thing is only going to prevent you from being able to find a healthy relationship  if you don't slow things down. "
587,"so far they've been black-and-white deal breakers - Like on the extreme end: cheating and alcoholism. In the middle example: A guy that stayed friends with an ex (normally that's okay with me, but he continued a relationship while she continued to be inappropriate with him, he constantly talked about her, etc. Basically he wasn't over her), and on the ""shallow"" end: I won't continue to date someone I don't feel physically attracted to within like 3 dates. I'm always attracted to someone's personality first, but if the physical part doesn't follow shortly after, I'll consider that a deal breaker too....  =/ Edit: The funny part is, I've dated the guys with more ""extreme"" deal breakers, for longer than any of the lesser deal breakers... So I definitely don't cut anyone off too quickly.... I'm all about a fair chance to get to know someone. "
588,"An 18 year old planning to take steroids is a ticking time bomb.

I know guys who have taken steroids and it completely changes them. Mood swings, shriveled balls, extreme aggression, and other bad shit are just some of the side effects."
589,"I don't even think this has much to do with your boyfriend, but look at your own life. I get that you don't like your job. Working a job you hate is very draining, and I 100% get that. But working full time at a job that you would need to supplement with government assistance and having to rely on other people financially? Doing that purposefully, I can't help but wonder why a grown woman would do something like that.

Your ""husband"" makes me want to eat glass."
592,"&gt; I'd bet she wants/needs to know that OP's romantic situation is ""worse"" or that he's still hung up on her.

This is very likely in my opinion. My husband's ex did this a bit -- gushing about how amazing things were with her boyfriend and then, since she couldn't jab at him for being single, she decided to repeatedly imply that *he knew, deep down* he wasn't happy with me. It turned out she was still obsessed with him and needed to know that he was doing badly without her. 

Of course, I'm biased because this is what my personal experience has shown me, but I'd almost be ready to put money on this being a similar situation."

Bisexual. Roommate is romantic partner. Wants to use you as his beard in public. 

Neurotic about cleanliness / organization/ order. The only way you can be allowed to see his apartment is through a video camera, so you can't touch anything / get germs on it / mess anything up. 

Embarrassing fetish. He really doesn't want you finding his collection of body pillows / porn DVDs / Precious Moments figurines. Maybe it's not even an embarrassing fetish; maybe he just has $80,000 worth of Fender Guitars in his collection, and doesn't want anyone accidentally damaging them.

Noise/smell conscious. Small space and/or thin walls means the neighbors hear everything. Heck, small space / thin walls means when he uses the bathroom and you're in the living room, *you* hear everything! (how unsexy is that on a date?)  Maybe his roommate likes to cook curry and microwave fish, or maybe the place just has a residual funk from dudes living in the same space and not cleaning often enough. 

Maybe he's a really strong introvert, and his living space is the only place he feels he can really recharge. "

601,All signs point to cheating. I can't imagine coming home from a concert and wanting to send the artists boob snaps. The non existent snap account and trying to cover by saying the pics were for you screams guilt. Looking for somewhere else to live is a smart idea.

&gt; We've both screwed up in this relationship so I don't feel like I'm able to judge too harshly.

No, judge harshly. These are really fucked up things to say and you should actually be scared. 

*He said your dog is less deserving of love because she met another human being before meeting him, and that it was his ""right"" to meet the dog first*. 

Seriously, take your rose-tinted glasses off, realise your boyfriend is insane and quite possibly dangerous, and remove him from you and your dog's life. "
609,"2.5 months isn't really that long when you consider the seriousness of the surgery and the anxiety it caused. It took me that long to recover from a c-section, add despite being cleared for heavy lifting by my doctor at 8 weeks, my MIL still fussed about it for another month or two. It was annoying, but her own fears and experience didn't match what I was feeling. It just took time for her to understand that I truly was recovered. "
610,That's an excellent point. When I've spent all day connected to my baby the last thing I want is someone else wanting quality time with my body.
611,"This is something that comes up all the time in /r/relationships. Every person has the ability and right to dictate what their boundaries are in a relationship. They don't have to make sense to you, or me, or anyone else. Your girlfriend has presented you a boundary. 

The other party has the ability to accept or reject the boundary, which is where you are. You can accept her conditions for the relationship and quit smoking weed, or reject the conditions and risk the relationship. 

There's no ""bad guy"" here. It's entirely possible you two are just incompatible long-term. "
612,"No, I just don't think ""just deal with it kid, she's grieving and therefore has free rein to treat you however she will"" is good or empathetic advice. Both need grief counseling, particularly the mother. As impossibly difficult as this is for her, she has to learn how to deal with it enough to stop neglecting and mistreating her living children."
613,"???

Sweetie, you really need some help.  Everyone deserves to have friends.  To say that you shouldn't be friends with people because you are selfish is untrue.  You simply need to work on behaving less so.  I can see that you're hurting and I'm sorry to see that.  But you've got to learn to respect the boundaries that others set.  Of course you deserve friends.  Just be mindful of how you treat those friends."
614,"This is the best advice. HR will think you're whiney and a bad loser if you tell on your ex gf with the guy she is with after you. Put on your big boy pants, ignore them and be professional. She is doing it to wind you up, don't let her and she will get over it.  "
615,"I don't think he's trying to push your buttons. But since it's something you're sensitive about it hurts.

To be fair, while it is a joint account, HE is getting paid on Friday, not the both of you. I doubt he's trying to make you feel bad, probably more him trying to say that he is the one working for the money, and he wants recognition for it. He just wants his contribution noticed.
"
616,"Depending on how regularly she gets tested, she could have had that chlamydia forever and not know. It's also really hard for women to transmit STDs to men, compared to the other way around, so it's not surprising that you didn't get it.

If she was having unprotected sex with you I wouldn't take her word that she wasn't having unprotected sex with anyone else she was seeing regularly. She probably initially blamed you because you are her current partner, and even if she knew you didn't have it she's dug her heels in too much to back down and now she can't show face. 

Her reaction, without having all of the information, was really shitty. I feel like when people have the STD conversation they make a great effort to be really careful to avoid accusations until there is any reason to suspect who gave what to who. So I would have to imagine this isn't her first go round on that rodeo, she seems like more trouble than she's worth. "
617,Don't call your (ex)boyfriend when you run out of gas though!
618,"Just my two cents here. In my circle of male friends, calling each other 'babe', 'sweetheart', 'luv' is just a part of our camaraderie together. Obviously, the way in which it is said matters but I don't think any outsiders looking in would expect homosexual intentions. It's just how we act together after years of close friendship. All of us are straight and comfortable with our sexualities (minus 1 who's still trying to figure it out). 

I'm not sure how it is where you live, but this is pretty common where I am in the UK. It's just a joke, a little banter between friends."

621,"OP, are you involved with anyone right now?

Because I kinda don't think this has anything to do with games. I think this has to do with the presence of another man in your son's life. If it was just your ex-wife playing the games with him I don't think it would be a problem. I think it's the fact that it's her boyfriend, someone you clearly resent."
622,"I might also add that, if you know of anyone he's close with (male work or personal friends), consider reaching out to them and asking that they check up on John. You don't need to provide the details of what he said, but say that you've noticed some concerning behavior, and you think he could use someone to talk with."
623,"I ask for help and I only have my kids seven days out of 14. They outnumber me, work doesn't let up just because it's my turn with the kiddos, I'm a human who gets tired.

626,"It's not insensitive at all.


You're showing compassion and understanding about something deeply personal to him which you yourself have no vested interest in and a very limited understanding of. It's very sweet.


As you've said it might be a little raw still and there is a chance (very small) that he will feel conflicted over it. I think when you give it to him you should frame it like this. He lost his religion because of something seemingly out of his control (I'm assuming here) so you're giving him the tools and option to take it back, if he wants it back, on his own terms and personally. He is under no obligation to read the book or go to church but you want him to know that he can explore this with your full support, no matter the result.


Good luck to the both of you, you both sound lovely!"

Only if she does the same for you. "
628,"This. I never understood how my father could look me in the eye and say I was lucky I wasn't raised by his father (my grandfather). Like punching me in the mouth and beating me with a belt is somehow less traumatic that whatever shit he went through as a kid.

632,"Congratulations on your pregnancy!


I'm sorry but you don't have a MIL problem, you have a husband problem.  Which will most likely worsen after the baby is born and MIL needs to see your baby all the time, and will have LOTS of advice for you.


If it's an 9-hr event, your husband will be there all 9 hours too.  Anytime she makes a comment, you need to say LOUDLY, hey hubs, your mom is asking about our birth control - what would you like to  say?  


You need to be OK with embarassing her and husband.


Sounds like your husband is in denial on how bad she is towards you, so you need to direct all of her bad behavior to him.  

If she tries anything when he's not around, then call him by phone or from the other room, and say, hey husband, come on over, MIL is giving us marriage advice.  If he refuses, then you go to his location with MIL. 


Good luck!"
633,Gyno should have definitely talked to her about other BC options. And just because one pill gave her mood swings and killed her libido doesn't mean all the pills will. A good gyno provides all the options. I had to try 3 or 4 different pills before I found one that worked for me.

644,"&gt;What do you do when your spouse grosses you out?

Maybe change perspectives? I don't mean that in a rude way, so hear me out:

Let's say your wife didn't care for porn and didn't write the erotic fanfiction. However, she was still unemployed. Instead, all she did was play phone apps and watch youtube videos.

In that situation, would you be supportive of those 'hobbies' or is it the fact that she is unemployed and lounging around in the office doing something you deem unproductive that bothers you?


On one hand, I don't think writing erotic fanfiction is really all that bad or even gross (but that is MY personal feelings on the matter). It's a form of creative writing, albeit sexual in nature.

However, if that's ALL my partner did or talked about, I'd be embarrassed. I'd want my partner to be looking for work and to have OTHER passions. 

The thing is, this isn't on the level of gross where your partner picks their nose and puts the boogers on the wall, or your partner takes a shit but doesn't wipe. This is on the level of ""I don't respect my partner's hobby"" because you find the *excessiveness* of it gross. 

If she also had a job and worked out and volunteered with disabled puppies but her guilty pleasure was writing erotic fiction, would it still bother you?

Is this really about being grossed out or is it a lack of respect? You're losing respect because you feel she wastes her time writing dirty novels while you financially support her.

Think about it, and start from there. The conversation with your wife would be less about ""you need to STOP doing this"" and more about ""I want us to have two incomes, and I want us to develop other hobbies together that aren't sexual in nature"".
 "
645,I feel like no one knows what a season pass is in this thread. 
646,"So... you have two absolutely terrible options from which to choose:

1. Be honest and deal with the fallout, and the fact that your girlfriend of 6 months might not pick you over her family.

2. Be evasive and just not tell them and hope they never find out. It's technically none of their business, but that's never stopped anyone before....

Both of those options really suck, but #1 is probably the safest bet. It's possible that you lose your girlfriend over this, unfortunately, but you've probably been aware of this possibility for some time now. 

Good luck."
647,"According to OP this isn't the first time. He's got a history of this, and apparently did it a lot more in the past."
648,"The people jumping to abuse are ridiculous. If they just got married in May, they are probably still adjusting to being married, and WANT to be together most likely. My bf and I hardly do stuff by ourselves, but that's because we LIKE spending time together. Sure, if either of us wants to do something with just our friends, we do. But more often than not, our friends invite US, not just one of us, so that's what we are used to. If you want time by yourself with her, just say you want to spend a girls only day. She's not a mind reader. There are no red flags in this relationship from this post. "

650,"I've dieted a few times over the years, I would never dream of asking someone not to eat something in front of me. I'm not an animal, I have self control. 

At what point do you stop? Random strangers eating chocolate on the bus? people walking in the street eating doughnuts or an ice cream? Where does his responsibility to himself end and everyone else's responsibility to cater to him begin? 

"
651,"I just don't find it reasonable though.

Is she supposed to hide her eating habits? Sneaking cakes and buns while he's out of the room? She shouldn't have to change or restrict her eating habits because he has no self restraint. It's not even like it's a hot food so the smell will linger, it's gone once it's eaten so once she's done the temptation is over, he had to ignore it for a few minutes at most.

If he can't deal with someone eating something sweet beside him then he will never be able to keep off his weight.

Dieting isn't just about losing weight it's a lifestyle change where you learn what trade offs you make. You can't go back to having what ever you want whenever you want. He has to learn self control or he'll just end up in a cycle of restricting for a while then gaining weight."
652,"Do you need to eat dog shit to know chicken or something tastes better? You could apply that logic to everything. 

Let's try all the things people claim are shit just to be sure!"
653,"&gt; I think it largely stems from the fact that she mistreated me as a baby and has told me the stories about how she would be so pissed off that I was crying that she'd leave me in my crib all day so that when my dad would get home I would have piss and shit all over myself and I would be so hungry from not being fed all day.

Protect your child by any means necessary. It would be reprehensible to leave your child in the hands of someone that you know has a history of neglecting children. There's a reason that you feel rage when you see her interact with your son. That's your protective mama bear nature kicking in. It's a good thing. Listen to it.

There is a saying that babies are ""narc food."" It sounds like that's really all your mother wants is to feed her narcissism using your helpless child. She wants your baby so she can share in all the attention a new baby brings. That's why she was so insistent about being in the delivery room. It had absolutely nothing to do with comforting and supporting you. It was just another way to make herself feel special because everything is all about her. And now she wants to tell all her friends about how she is the most important person in that baby's life. She wants to post photos all over social media and rake in all the likes and attention that brings. You are absolutely doing the right thing by saying no. 

Just come up with a few stock answers and use the same answers over and over again. Don't try to give her any reasons because she'll just see that as an invite to try to argue against each of your reasons. Just stick to things like ""We're not going to need babysitting any time soon."" ""No thank you."" ""We're all set."" ""You know mom, you seem to be getting very upset. Let's end our visit now and we can try again when you're a little calmer.""

Oh, and stop letting your mother through the door when she shows up unannounced. Try to plan any visits with her in a neutral place. Meet her for a half an hour for coffee or breakfast. It's easier to get away from temper tantrums if you can just get up and leave."

You see Vick as a friend and only as a friend. Great. You have a *responsibility* to your *child* that you recognize *boundaries*, though. And your *boundaries* were violated here and you haven't recognized that. Your friend Sara is a good friend who recognized it.  Your sister as well.     
      
who knows if he's trying to sleep with you? there's a good chance. but learn to recognize dirt bags now because he is a dirt bag, no matter what his intent is. if a guy twice your age is trying to fuck you, he's probably not a good guy, or he'd already have a family. sounds simple, but exceptions are exceptions. generally correct though. "
655,I get the feeling he doesn't care so much about having things in common. 
656,"Sounds like he's upset about not being able to spend as much time with you, but isn't comfortable articulating his emotions. Instead he turns it into something you're doing wrong. I hope counseling goes well!"
657,"I didn't state that ""nobody has those issues when sleeping with someone else."" All I said was everything you read on the internet isn't true. You are choosing to interpret those words to mean something entirely different."
658,"When he's gone for a few hours: pack your stuff (esp. IDs, whatever cash you have, passport etc) and then move out to a friend at whose house you can crash for a while. Leave a note on the table saying 'we are done. This relationship is over. Do not contact me.' Then block him on your phone and social media, and inform anybody that he could use to reach you that you two are broken up and that it's messy. The only contact you should have with him in the future is, say, to pick up your mail or any items you've left behind, and you should be accompanied by a trusted friend. 

Do not let him convince you to meet. Do not let him argue his way back into a relationship with you. Do not let boredom, loneliness, or doubt diminish your resolve. You must be strong and unyielding. It'll be hard, but the good news is that it'll get better. 

You may think that he is bad news and the relationship is not healthy. Wait until 6 months, a year or two after the breakup, and you will understand best just how toxic it was. The trick is to survive those first 6 months. 

You must secure a place to stay at  for a while. A friend's couch or a family member's guest room is good. A woman's shelter if it comes to that will do. Then work your ass off to regain your financial independence. 

In the future, do not allow yourself to ever let go so easily of your financial independence, and be very wary of relationships with a big age gap (they are often indicative of unhealthy dynamics). "

But the reality is that her asshole husband could very well give her asymptotic gonorrhea or chlamydia. She could lose her fertility. If she gets pregnant the baby could be at risk.

I'd hate to be put in a box like that. I did an English degree and love embroidery and playing the piano and post makeup looks to reddit. I also love tech, plan to build a computer and am currently doing a Computing Masters with the view to become a webdev or programmer. 

I feel like people oversimplify descriptions of themselves and others when they feel insecure/have low self esteem. He wants to feel good about being logical and shit which is all well and good but comparing himself to you in order to achieve this confidence is unfair. Especially when his assessment of you is reductive.

Edit: also what do you mean about acting formal with you? It sounds like if you question him he starts acting cold/distant/puts a barrier up? That ain't fun."

671,"&gt;but the way it is all happening is destroying me.

You're talking an awfully lot about how this hurts *you* and how it ""breaks your heart""...it's starting to look like a yellow flag.

If this is about your son and not about you start acting like it, because your reaction is concerning."
672,Six Flags does it for sure. You get a whole coupon book with the season pass. 
673,"I'm baffled that you don't have discussions about the things you are doing. 

I'd be shocked if my husband arrange a dancing class with someone else and did not tell me.  I'm pretty introverted btw."
674,"Better yet, kick her out. She's in the wrong here. I know you want the extra income, but, really, your mental health is going to suffer if you have to keep hearing how shitty she has it right now when, really, she messed up here, and she has no right to act like she's got it bad right now."
675,"This is pretty dumb logic? You're admitting that shaving generally looks nicer/sexier whatever by saying it's reserved for special nights, but what about the people who want to look sexy/special all the time? That's why most people shave anyway. 

I'm not one to tell my girlfriend that she needs to shave or whatever anyway, but your logic doesn't hold up imo "
676,"Hmm I would say this is a amber flag (if not a red flag!). 

it's really bizarre and just remind her that it's your place as well as hers. 

You just have to tell her that you are an adult and as an adult, you will be staying out past 8pm  and sleeping over somewhere is not going to be an option.

I'm not saying she might be controlling (it might be something else) but it seems like she's making these rules and making it more inconvenient for you to stay out late so that eventually you cave in and stop visiting friends and family at certain times all together."
677,"Disagreed. I'm familiar with the community OP is describing and it's way, *way* outside the feminist mainstream, and is widely considered toxic and hateful.

This is like finding out your SO posts on the subreddit dedicated to a pill of a certain crimson hue; it requires immediate intervention because the more time she spends there, the more it will radicalize her."
678,"&gt; But I gotta admit I get a bit bothered when she tells me about the cough she's had for a year now or that the doctor found pus in her throat. I know those aren't STDs, but I can't help but wonder if they're symptoms somehow.

Of....sex? Unprotected sex doesn't just get you sick, unless you contract an STD.

And as someone who has had ulcers in her throat (fuck. that.), it's not connected to sex. 


I think you are way overstepping. You are not her personal chastity belt. You don't get to dictate how she has sex. Just stop. 

Her and her past partners were all irresponsible about wearing condoms. That's on her and them. It has literally nothing to do with you. Pull your head out of her vagina, please. 
"
679,"Thanks for the reply, I really appreciate it.

I will definitely ask her to try really hard and write down any potential reasons why she could be this upset over this.

As for me, its not a deal breaker because its literally 1 problem out of an extremely wonderful relationship.  If I was going out all the time and staying out late 1) I could understand her being mad (for different reasons), and 2) it would happen a lot.  But most nights I just want to be at home anyways, so its a rare (but very annoying) occurrence.

I didn't mean to imply she was mad at me all the time, sorry for giving off that impression.  She has also tried to not be mad, which I appreciate, but her emotions are so easy to read since I know her so well that I of course notice."
680,"Yeah and coming from someone in professional Theatre now (my S.O. Is as well)-- it's really unrealistic to expect someone to come see every showing of your performance. I, as a Stage Manager, have to see the show every time it runs. It gets boring. My bf (the T.D. also had to sit through tech to see it about 100 times). He'd come see it once all put together and that was good enough for me. Especially because we had a new show every single month. I don't know, sounds like she's overreacting. But, then, some actors are like that."
681,"Well, that's kind of cute.  And mutually agreed upon!

It's really his reaction that's the problem."
682,Maybe she doesn't want you as a friend and just communicates with you to be polite? 
683,"When I was 8 (or even younger, my dad was quite strict), my dad would return anything (including trick or treat candy) if I did not properly thank the person giving it to me and then I would not get anything at all. The idea that a child or person would do this with that many presents at every holiday and still gets presents bogols my mind. "
684,"You summed up nicely why a validation based question is problematic. This form of questioning is accusing him of being a bad person and puts the focus on yourself. OP, it's better to frame words which puts the focus on the other person. for example, ""Thanks for the sweet words"", emphasizes how great of a person he is and doesn't ask him to validate your insecurities."
685,"That's not true when it comes to workplaces, especially where the ADA is involved.

Everyone in the workplace has the right to eat peanuts on their own time. They don't have that right at work. Furthermore, the organization has a legal responsibility to make reasonable accommodations for an employees peanut allergy.

OP might be able to work out a deal with HR, where she's allowed to consume her smoothies at work as long as they're contained and she doesn't wash the containers at work, but she isn't having her rights infringed."
686,"I was diagnosed with PTSD at age 19, but I recovered and felt like I had worked through everything. Then I had a child. I don't think you can really comprehend how fucked up childhood abuse is until you know what it feels like to be a parent. When you know you would fight, kill, or die for your child, it definitely begs the (unanswerable) question - why didn't my parents feel that way about me? How could they do what they did? "
687,Yeah this is what's at issue here. The finances are a symptom.
688,She's not annoyed when you're at work or practice because those are important obligations you can't miss. She is traveling to see you yet you want to leave her at home Sunday to go on a bar crawl with dudes you see probably almost every day. It's so disrespectful! 
689,"I have a cat. I love my cat. Therefore, I don't date people who are allergic to cats. If I found out a date/potential partner was allergic to cats, I would end the relationship before I got too attached. 

Honestly, this is her problem, not yours. She needs to choose whether she wants to keep her cat or live with you. She can't have both. "
690,"His apologies are all manipulative and sneaky tricks to get you to take responsibility for every problem in the relationship. Look at this:

&gt; He was very regretful. He said he did not know the affair was going on and he just did not want me to drive home because he thought I was drunk.

In other words, it's your fault for leading him to think you were drunk, not his fault for flying off the handle. You caused him to threaten you. 

How much bullshit is that? Is he a ventriloquist's dummy? No: the only reason he got mad and threatened you is because he wanted to. That's it.

I know: your first instinct is to reply to this to explaaaaaain in very great detaaaaail specifically why this isn't the case, but you need to stop, completely and totally, dwelling in *specifics* you can explain away. Look at the *pattern*:

&gt;blame me for my insecurity

Over a half-naked girl he makes crude sexual comments about. (They're having sex, by the way, and probably belittled you behind your back for not catching on.)

&gt; cleaning the bathroom

A deliberate, malicious attempt to make you feel insecure! He withholds affection and induces you to chase him for it. If you're always chasing him, you'll never take the time to ask if you should be.

&gt;treated me like a princess

Google ""cycle of abuse"". Abusers often treat their partners like gold until they don't, and then after the bruises begin to fade they wail about how sorry they are ""but you just made me so mad!"", or in your case ""you're so insecure!"" or ""I thought you were drunk!"" (a nice one if he's hoping to keep you away from friends).

&gt;talking in secret

Of course he is; if he were a real man he wouldn't do this. He's trying to brainwash you into seeing your relationship as ""us against the world"", as if your meddling parents were interfering with majestic, courageous, adult True Love. That way you'll pull away from your parents and he can isolate you.

Again a pile of bullshit. Your parents are trying desperately to help you. They see right through this guy: they have his number. You need to trust their judgment on this one. He is no good.

He is not Romeo and you are not Juliet: he's playing you like a violin."
691,"Other than him being a complete ass, verbally abusive, rude, unappreciative etc, yeah he sounds a peach.

This will get old VERY fast"
692,"Mine is labeled ""shitten spray"". Katara definitely knows what it's for when she sees it, but it's like sometimes her impulse control just can't help it. She'll pounce, bite, then immediately skitter under the nearest piece of furniture because she knows she's not supposed to and she's gonna get it but she just couldn't help herself, lol.

Even though Max and Katara are the same age, I can see the benefit of Max's upbringing where he had his brothers and sister to check him when he bit too hard. Either he'll be able to teach Katara how to kitten properly, or she'll be stubborn and never learn but we'll have a maximum of a year more of this behavior from her. She's really starting to Cat lately instead of Kitten, and it makes me happy but also sad- my little one is growing up."
693,Four months is WAY TOO EARLY to expect him to disclose finances. He may be independently wealthy. He's doing something right if he owns his home outright. Don't pry any further or you'll come off as a gold digger.
694,Look at all the idiots who successfully raise kids. You'll be fine.
695,"So, this is about more than the dog. He criticizes you for voicing your needs and calls you selfish for doing a perfectly normal thing, i.e. nesting and preparing for a baby? I'd bet dollars-to-doughnuts that the dog is only a microcosm, he won't help with the baby, and you will be subject to ridicule if you voice your needs. Infants yield sleepless nights, expenses, stress - the fact that you guys are ill-aligned on the issue of a dog does not speak highly of your longevity or compatibility as a couple, frankly. I'm sorry that he's criticizing you on this issue, but I don't think that getting rid of the dog will be the end of that behavior"
696,"Right? It's great he can be friends with an ex, but the perimeters of that whole dynamic doesn't sound healthy at all. "
697,Or heard things from friends and family. 
698,"&gt; When he's angry he'll lock me out of our home or tell me I need to find other places to stay- he says he doesn't want to be around me. He tells me I'm hormonal and to get over it.

Holy shit"
699,"Yeah yeah, you're so emo and edgy. 

You're not going to be the next Joe Rogan or Zuckerberg with that attitude."
700,"You should find a new therapist as well. Talking about this with your current girlfriend, in this brand new environment will no doubt trigger something in you...you should find a professional to talk to and help build a support network around yourself.

701,"Has your boyfriend ever traveled with a small child on public transit? Does he know what kind of special pain in the butt that is?

Let me tell you, as a child who grew up poor as hell, whose mother dragged her on the bus to and from the welfare office and her work and beauty school that it was not fun or easy to manage. 

Have you helped your daughter find other SAHM(P)s that would be willing to take her daughter or about a sliding scale daycare. 

What about state assistance for childcare?

Seriously, you should be ashamed for telling your daughter to leave but that you'll take care of your grandchild without hesitation. I'm sure that made your daughter feel real *great* inside. 

If and when your daughter leaves prepare yourself for little or no contact with her or your grandchild. What you've offered is and has already damaged your relationship beyond any matter of repair. "
702,She ruined her own life.
703,You spread rumours with no basis whatsoever. Grow. The. Fuck. Up. 
704,"I think you need to love yourself enough to not need the attention from men. Fixating on the attention will only give you extra stress and could possible cause you to over-analyse. Just be yourself. Also, having the thoughts like this guy may be the one is going to be too much, especially you don't know this person very well. He could have done bad shits in the past and you might not accept him as who he is. Stop fantasising , take it slowly (slower) and step by step.

My approach to guys, not really only guys but everyone, is to learn about their stories and to know who they really are, be their friends and be interested to hear what they say. 
I started to have anxiety of meeting new people and talking to them two years ago and still do. I force myself to look them in the eyes and maybe it will come naturally with practice. One of the guys who I have recently met told me that he thought I was a very confident girl and he didn't even know that I have anxiety until I told him about it. I guess fake it till you make it.
Still learning and hoping to learn from others. :)"
705,"Yes I know... He told me it's probably been over a year since he's had a whole day without a drink so I was worried about the no drinking period before surgery. The doctors said that there is medication they can give him to help, but ideally they want him drinking a lot less before surgery. How is your ex now if you don't mind me asking? "
706,Why are you shitting six times a day? You should go to the doctor that's not normal.
707,"My boyfriend's old roommate did this. Every time he left the bathroom, she would go sniff it. She was a poop sniffer"
708,"IMO, she wants to know, because she can't trust him.

You'd be doing her a favor, because she's not getting the truth from him.

Outside of blatant paranoia - is there *anything* that suggests she'd be violent, to you?"
709,"I mean, it was probably just an oversight on their part, I'm planning a wedding right now and I can't think of every single person's plus one off the top of their head.

Just tell your boyfriend to ask his cousin to see if it's okay if you attend, I'm sure it'll be fine. Probably just an oversight."

717,"I am married, and my husband would tell em to get the hell out. I mean, when I was sick- and had medical reasons for not doing anything, that was one thing- but no, I'm to busy watching shows and playing video games? I'd be laughed out onto the street."
718,"We see this so often on this subreddit I feel like - the whole, ""sometimes I don't like confrontation"" thing.

Can I just say, as a fairly applicable blanket statement, that if you don't feel comfortable asking questions to your closest ppl (friends, SO, family, etc), there's a chance you should re-evaluate the power balance and the basis of your relationship entirely.

I can totally understand for other friends, acquaintances, strangers, coworkers, bosses, etc, that asking challenging questions can seem tough. But if you can't ask simple questions back to your friend of 10 years without feeling self-doubt, then there is a high, high, high chance that it was never an equal or healthy relationship to begin with.  "
719,"People are really nervous about bleach. To some extent, they're right--a lot of bleach is needed to turn brown hair platinum. It's possible your friend could fuck up your hair with that amount of bleach. More likely, the shade won't be quite what you had envisioned. But really, it's just hair. If you want your friend to bleach the shit out of it, go for it. I bleached my own and many other people's hair at your age. It generally turned out fine. As long as you're prepared for the possibility that things won't go to plan (i.e., you're not going to have a mental breakdown and trash your friendship with this person if your hair does end up looking like shit), I don't see what the big deal is."
720,"""I'm not going to pretend I love earrings, but it's your body and you get to do what you please with it.""

Trying to prevent someone from wearing earrings because you don't like them would be weirdly controlling and red-flaggy. 

If she gets her ears pierced and it bothers you that much, you're free to break up with her and go date someone else.

Honestly the degree to which this seems to freak you out suggests a bit of therapy might help. Millions of people all over the world have piercings and are fine. 
"
721,"you need to learn from this experience and take responsibility for your criticisms,  and respect your ex.

 you need to go no contact with her and move on."
722,"Well duh, you're taking advantage of him and admitting it would make you a bad person. Therefore just don't admit and you can pretend you're still a good person."
723,"&gt; In my experience, whenever someone says something along the lines of ""I would NEVER like so-and-so"" or ""That's ridiculous, I have NO interest whatsoever in them"", it is usually the opposite. 

My ex used to tell me how much she hated a specific friend of mine.  They're married and have 2 kids now."

726,"It is manipulative, though. And honestly, most people wouldnt care. Ive never met someone who really cared about any smells knowing the person is clean, unless it was the smell of infection.

Has she ever made a joke about your penis before going down on you? Or a joke about how your balls smell after a long day before going down on you? If not, then theres no way for you to justify this."
727,"One simply can't put a price tag on *support*! 

In all seriousness, though, having a decent bra (not necessarily expensive, but unfortunately it often comes with high price) is absolute necessity! It gives support, helps with the weight and improves posture. It's hard to be all lovely and gracious when there's a wire sticking in your flesh and the burden of several kilos pressing your shoulders and pulling your torso closer to dirt! "

733,"wow. Sorry to say your sister sounds really strange.   I think the best thing to do, at this point, is to put them all on an information diet.  You focus on your honeymoon and the wonderful life that you and your soon to be wife will have together. (And don't share the plans) Show up at your sister's wedding,  stand where she says stand and generally just be polite.  It probably is true that the mother will be more invested in a daughter's wedding than in that of a son.  Your sister sounds incredibly jealous and resentful of you and your life.  But look what you have compared to what she has!!!  After the wedding, I think you really might consider lowering the amount of contact you have with your sister and maybe any parts of the family that have treated you poorly over the years.  Build the life you want to have with the woman, with the partner you have chosen."
734,Or he just raw dogs it
735,"Dude she sounds awful. Seriously, run. 

You sound like a great guy "
736,"Ugh I wish you had gotten more feedback. You're in a serious situation. 

OP, I'm going to say something that you're not going to want to hear. **Your parents are physically abusing you**. 

They are hitting you and putting you in an unsafe environment. It doesn't matter how bratty your brother is being, there is never an excuse for any of you to be hit. 

I get it. You want to be able to solve this simply, quietly, behind the 4 walls of your home. You don't want to rock the boat... you just want all the yelling to stop. I'm really sorry OP, but that's jut not going to happen. 

Your parents are two individuals who are unfortunately unequipped to be effective parents. Sadly, instead of realizing they're poor parents and getting help, they lash out you and your brother and feel sorry for themselves. 

I'm concerned for your well being. They're hitting, they're yelling, and they're using manipulative tactics (your father in particular with his ""why do I have bad sons"" routine). *This is not parenting*. I'm worried about the short and long term implications of this abuse. 

If you're anything like me OP, you'll be tempted to just keep riding this out and try to talk to them, to avoid ""making things worse"". This is the wrong attitude. Not only is **none of this on you**, but this isn't going to stop. And as you go further into your teen years, they will get worse. 

Time to talk to your counsellor. Time to open up about the hitting. And time to look for help from your counsellor. 

Please remember. You can love your parents and they can love you, but they can still be unhealthy and dangerous people in your life.

But regardless, OP has every right to set a boundary here, and I really do think that her husband is being selfish.  I seriously think there's something about keeping this dog that appeals to him and *that*'s why he's pushing it, not because the dog's current home is so terrible.

766,"It might be useful for you and your family to go for 1-2 counseling sessions. Sometimes having input from a neutral third party makes all the difference.

Sorry for the cards you were dealt OP. Hope you go easy."
767,I suggest confronting your brother about this. What exactly was he doing hacking into your boyfriend's email anyway? Did he show you any proof about the accusations?
768,"She was 17, which is a child, and mentally ill.  I did not say he forced her into marriage, and I DID say that I know his intentions were good.

But the facts are she was a mentally ill child, and he was an adult.  She's growing up and healthy now, and realizing this isn't a good relationship for her.  

I encouraged him to seek counselling and to let her go.  Nothing about that is harsh, but there is no reason to say that what he did was fine, because it wasn't.  It was a serious mistake.  He was young, yes, but she was an ill child.  It should not have happened."
769,"That's not a job, thats just life."
770,"Just FYI, this comes across a bit victim blamey. There's more to staying with an abuser than just not having the money to move. Especially when it's your father you have lived with your whole life."
771,"
&gt;You're probably talking from personal experience. But I disagree. Most 18 year olds I knew back then were normal and wouldn't do this to a friend of a friend.  

Yeah, doing this to his face constantly, and trying to bring a more attractive girl for him to hook up with is a million miles away from normal teenage behaviour. 

It borders on some kind of group-induced sociopathy. "
772,"This sounds a lot more like sexual assault than her cheating on you. It was her first time drunk, she came clean to you immediately, had a physical reaction to the discovery that she was in bed with another man, and is basically dropping everything to convince you to stay. Those aren't the actions of someone who cheated. "
773,[removed]
774,"Do not tell the coworker of his infidelity!! She will find out when HR deals with him. If you tell her directly she will likely deny, get jealous, and act like you are some harlot rubbing her boyfriend's affection for you in her face. 

Don't put yourself in that position. You tell HR, bring the package to them and say you are shocked at his actions. You give them a document outlining his past offenses to you and tell them his behavior is escalating. Request he have no contact with you and continue to be the best employee you can be at this bad ass job. "
775,"It's just a piece of furniture.
It's not different than touching her or having Sex with her. Her Ex did all that too, but you wouldn't want to throw her away, right?

Are a step back for a moment and try to see how weird you're being about a piece of furniture..."
776,"&gt; You should have some goal in life other than being his girlfriend.
&gt; You should have some goal in life other than being his girlfriend.
&gt; You should have some goal in life other than being his girlfriend.
&gt; You should have some goal in life other than being his girlfriend.

Like being a physics major with a degree from the Naval Academy, perhaps?"

778,"Story time. 


In high school, I was in a long distance relationship. To give you a very sanitized version of the story, senior year of high school, I realized that  I was going to go to college...and he had several more years of college...and between that and many other reasons, I didn't want to be in the relationship any more. We had been dating long distance for YEARS.


So, his birthday was soon. Well, you can't break up with someone near their BIRTHDAY, can you? (/s) Or so my naive self thought at the time.


OP, right after my then-boyfriend's birthday, his father died. Of course he visited, I had to pretend like I was still brimming over with feelings for him, support him, etc. After we'd broken up, my ex later confided in me that he would much have preferred a break up before his father passed away.


There will always be something. Don't tell her right before an exam, but it's the weekend. Try to get through this cleanly, compassionately, but firmly before a birthday/holiday/anniversary/whatever comes up.


Best of luck to you both, and good luck on your exams."
779,"Just because it didn't happen to you doesn't mean it's not a possible side-effect for others!

When taking these meds as a migraineur, we tend to get some really bizarre, rare side effect."
780,"Exactly! Responsible, caring, kind my ass. This dog's health problems wouldn't be so bad if his owner actually brought him to the vet like a good owner would. It's easier to prevent health issues or fix them when they first show up, not years later, where it might be too late.

I highly doubt the dog is ""comfortable"". He's in pain and probably perceptive enough to know his owner doesn't care that much about him. He's just waiting for him to die, as OP said..."
781,"Nice, glad to year things worked out so well. You did very well and glad your hubs stepped up too.

Elephant in the room question: Now that you've gotten it all figured out, are you planning on a second child? :)"
782,"In this time and age, this is exactly like accidentally walking into the bathroom while she's changing or into their room during sex.

There are a few reasons this mst be making OP uncomfortable:

- **You weren't there with her.** If it was walking into you two having sex, you would share the experience and it'd be more ""whoopsie daisy"".

- **There is a possibility the photos are ""out there"" because you made a mistake.** Not saying your dad would keep them or whatever, but you might be feeling guilty because your gf is the one in a vulnerable position because of something you screwed up. It's an accident and they happen but, most importantly:

- **She doesn't know.** If she had experienced it first hand, it would've been different. In this case, she might as well never find out. You may be feeling guilty about that.

My advice? Come clean to the her, apologise as much as you need and prepare for not receiving nudes for a whike, maybe forever. Take new and better precautions so this won't happen again (there are safe apps that are a different storage for content like this that are password protected and not cloud synced) and show her these measures. Also talk ti your dad, thank him for telling you and telk him you feel like an ass about it and you'd appreciate he never mentions it to anyone. "
783,"Be prepared for her to cry, beg, and promise the world once you confront her. She's going to be frantic at losing her security and meal ticket. Don't blame yourself for her actions."
784,"Um, no there are no reasons to continue dating a CHILD. If I caught you dating one of my daughters, I'd have you put in jail so fast you wouldn't know what hit you."
785,"If he's always been that gross, well, I'm surprised you even exist. "
786,This makes no sense. The dog has no idea what's going on right now. If the dog gets overly excited about anyone coming over then that itself is something in need of training. Not everyone wants to snuggle and pet your dog. And that's ok. It's not like his life with have no affection at all because one or two friends don't participate.  
787,"Sadly, noone will care if she added you first as soon as she starts crying about it. Society really sucks here, just tell her and get out."
788,"Strange. I have a child as a result of dating someone with the same mental health issue and thought process as your sister.

I didn't marry her."
789,"You're an idiot and a huge jerk, break up with your girlfriend now. "
790,So what you're saying is that your wife isn't good enough for you to not cheat on her?
791,"If you're ever in Vancouver and you see a young Korean guy bumping into inanimate objects and apologizing, then yeah lmao. Probably me. "
792,I'd probably laugh at him though 
793,Everything was great...until it wasn't.  The trust is gone.
794,"Your girlfriend is upset that you're basically taking another girl out on dates? Shocker!!! 

Maybe Jennifer IS interested in you. And honestly you sound like you're interested in her. 

What's more important to you? Your relationship with your girlfriend OR your friendship with Jennifer? If you're not willing to stop going on dates with Jennifer for your GF's comfort (and it's a totally reasonable boundary) then break up because then you're clearly prioritizing someone else over your relationship. "
795,"So to summarise:
1. Your dad wanted you to play with him when you were kids and instead got a dog because you wouldn't play with him

2. You signed up for a 5k and he was really excited to support you in this

3. Instead of using this as a bonding experience and a way to build your fitness and have him not be disappointed you are going to give up and disappoint him. 

4. Your going to ignore the advice on how to talk to him and alternative ways to handle this (like walking) and complain that no one is giving you advice. 
"
796,"Good job man, I'm in a similar situation, maybe I'll grow the balls needed someday"
797,"You're wrong, but I can see that arguing with you is a fool's errand. 

Feel free to Google systemic racism, though, if you actually care about the answer. "
798,You have no idea who initiated it. You were not there. 
799,"BF is a black guy. The neighbors could just as easily call the cops on him and get him arrested for no good reason.

OP, your BF isn't smart. He should be looking at moving, frankly, because he's made a bad situation worse and it's only a matter of time before some real shit goes down."
800,"""I know it's my problem. She said 'no' and I should accept that""

You've said it yourself. You're acting like a child not getting his own way. Pestering your loved one and pressuring them continuously into a sexual act that they're not comfortable with is extremely immature and disrespectful. "
801,"In reading your subsequent comments it sounds like your issue really has to do more with your body image than with your mother. You are hurt and angry that you won't have ""the attractive body I've dreamed of"". It seems like you are directing your anger at her instead of dealing with your emotions. Whether she is responsible or not, cutting her out of your life won't change the fact that you used to be obese. It won't make the excess skin go away and most importantly it won't change your negative self image. Punishing her clearly isn't making you feel better. 

You are solely in charge of your body now, your mother has no say in what you eat. If the relationship is healthy now that you are an adult then I'd reconsider going no contact although you may need a little space until you've worked through your anger. It sounds like you've got some deep emotional pain to work through. Have you considered therapy?

I know it must be hard to put so much work and effort into a goal and then be disappointed with your results. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be attractive and I'm not minimizing your disappointment but could you try focusing on what you've gained from your weight loss? Better health and improved energy and stamina (presumably) for one.  How about working towards a non appearance related fitness goal? Such as mastering a new sport/hobby"
802,Said it to my husband last night and I couldn't care less about his body hair. I just know he hates it when it's that long and he hadn't noticed. 
803,"Slow day at the office, huh?

I'm not going to judge what you're into, but this has the potential to turn openly unprofessional *fast*.  Keep your head about you."
804,"In your next conversation, i think you should also let him know *why* his language hit such a nerve. It's not just that ""need"" is commanding. It's also that the ""need"" he wanted to impart on you corresponds to a social norm. Western society tells women that they need to shave their legs to be pretty, feminine, and even to appear clean/hygienic. His use of the word relates back to that norm and that pressure. It may have felt benign to him but there's good reason it didn't feel so to you."
805,It's better to be hated for trying to do the right thing than to have the guilt of not doing anything on your hands. 
806,"Wait...his argument doesn't even make sense.  You make less, but you pay HALF the bills, correct???  So then you ARE an equal contributor!  He's assigning you a personal value based on a lower income, and deciding that because you are worth less financially, even though you contribute equally, you have to be his house and sex slave?

NO.  NOT OK.

Chores should be split based on hours worked, which is equal in your case.  And stop giving him free BJ's all the time if he's neglecting your needs!  He treats you like crap.  You deserve better."
807,"I don't really think that this is worthy of interrupting sleep patterns. There was nothing that you - never mind he - could do except wait. 

I think that allowing him to sleep until he needed to wake up would be the nicest thing to do. This is especially true if you had some advance discussions about losing your job (put bluntly: if you saw this coming). 

That's not to say that I think it's awful that you woke him. I don't, I just think it's a bit needy.

That said, I don't think his response was all that bad. Everyone is grumpy when they're woken up unexpectedly. "
808,"So your wife can't have an awesome birthday celebration, because it makes youre insecure? That's lame."
809,"""they're my best and only friends.""

You need new friends. "
810,"What about his compassion towards her? Why doesn't she deserve compassion, too?"
811,"It could be many things but like everyone says you need to talk to him and he needs to open up. 

He may be mad at himself that he can give you want you need socially and that bothers him because you're his wife and he loves you. 

It could be he's mad that you're going out multiple times a week and don't tell him anything and as a partner that worries him. 

Again seek marriage counseling asap. 

**EDIT**
The more I read your other comments and what more you said I think your husband's reaction was so strong because he saw it as a date with another guy. "
812,You should move on. Block him. He's not your best friend. 
813,"I just want you to know that you *are not* in any way weird or crazy for feeling uncomfortable that your boyfriend's instagram feed (which I'm sure he scrolls through dozens of times a day) is full of highly sexualized pictures of other women. Don't let anyone convince you that you should have to pretend to be ""cool"" with that. At best it's extremely immature. I think most women would find it to be a huge turn off, even without the past history of openly oggling random women in public who are just trying to go about their own business, and in front of his girlfriend now less!  

I know it's such cliche advice on this sub, but I think you should really think hard about whether it's worth your time and in your own best interest to stay in a relationship with this guy. Wouldn't you rather be alone with the chance of finding a guy who makes you feel desirable? You're twenty years old, for christs sake! You should be with a guy who can't stop checking *you* out, and instead your stuck feeling insecure because of your boyfriends constantly wandering eye. "
814,"I can relate: I've dated two girls who had that wandering eye in my life. We'd go out, have a good time over food or a drink perhaps, and suddenly she'd look up and start *beaming* at someone. Smiling and eye- fluttering at the waiter, things like that.

It's absolutely infuriating. I am not one bit possessive, and don't care much who my date talks to, but there is something extremely disrespectful about hard-core flirting while on a date. I decided that I couldn't cope with that and prefer to be friends, which I have for 15 and 25 years, respectively. As did others I presume: they are now both nearing 45 and only have short- term relationships."
815,"You should see all the other acronyms on r/weddingplanning

BM is my favorite. ""BM is being a nightmare."" Is a fun tidbit you see on there now and again."
816,"This. I've never broken the law, been arrested, or been in jail. The worst thing on my record is a speeding ticket and a retail theft fine from when I was 18, in high school, and stupid (probably wouldn't come up anymore 20 years later, and if a business or employer wanted to hold a dumb teenage mistake over my head at nearly 40 fuck them anyway). 

Yet, every interaction I've had with police has been bad. From unproductive, like the time I tapped my horn to get the lady ahead of me's attention at a stop light, and she flipped out. An officer showed up at my apartment and refused to believe me, refused to charge me with anything, but refused to leave - it was over an hour or more of repeating the same story over, and over, and over, and over and getting nowhere with this dumbshit. I finally had to say ""Officer, I need to be to work. If you're going to cite me for something you'll need to do that. Otherwise, I'll need your superior or I need you to leave."" Another 15 minutes round and round until I called the precinct standing right there and asked them to come collect this guy, because he was parked behind my car and *I needed to leave*. I posted a comment the other day about how a doctor misinterpreted a comment as me being suicidal when I wasn't, and a police officer called me at work. When I refused to tell him I was going to harm myself, because I, yanno, wasnt, he started *screaming* at me, using abusive language, and making it about HIM and how I had wasted his time. I have at least a half dozen more examples, but ANY TIME I or someone around me has needed actual HELP, like when there was domestic violence in my apartment parking lot, or someone tried to break into my work, *the police never came*. They literally just never showed up.

You would be hard pressed to tell me that these are isolated incidents with a few bad cops."
