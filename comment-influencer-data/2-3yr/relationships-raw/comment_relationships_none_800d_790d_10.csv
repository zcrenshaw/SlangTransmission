0,"Just take the damn test.

And yes, she almost certainly is pregnant, although if you are lucky its PANIC about being pregnant that's delaying it."
1,You were born with survival instincts developed over the history of our species. Those instincts exist for a reason. Don't be afraid to trust them and second guess yourself less.
2,"OP this is the single BEST present idea. It's seriously amazing and she won't interpret it poorly, she'll see it as an amazingly kind and thoughtful gift."
3,"You can explain to him if you want, but in this day and age your parents' views are definitely outdated. It's too late for them to change their views on these matters (and why would they need to?) But not too late for you. Definitely don't take any more advice from your mother about dating though haha, leaving your wallet at home to avoid paying is sketchy as. Another thing you should take from this is that he's treating you as an equal in your relationship! It can take some women a really long time to find someone who doesn't treat them like a mindless sex machine but he acknowledges your worth in that he treats you as a functional member of society!"
4,"If I may take a guess at what he was thinking: ""ME! ME! ME!"" I doubt he was thinking about you, your feelings, health or wishes. I think the details of what he was thinking and why don't change that you should be cautious with him.

Maybe he is afraid he would regret not having a child, but if he knocks you up and later on figures out children are not for him, he has an easy out as it was an ""accident"" and he never agreed with having a child. "
5,"What you're describing is an almost textbook example of the kind of thing counseling/ couple's counseling was *invented* for. 

It can help you both learn to navigate each other's arguing styles and find a common ground. It can facilitate communication and understanding as long as both of you are committed to really working toward a healthy goal. 

I might be wrong, but it kinda sounds to me like you're either looking for some magical ""quick-fix"" or you're looking for some kind of permission from the collective reddit hive mind to end your relationship. 

It bugs me that you appear immediately resistant to (in my opinion) the most logical first step in mending your relationship. Why is that?"
6,She is perfectly right to tell a white lie to escape his behavior as long as it's in good faith- not covering up actual infidelity.
7,"This is a classic thought process from a particular kind of guy, ""I don't know what I want, but I know I like fucking"".  Set some boundaries and goals for yourself, and break it off if it's not heading a direction you want.

&gt; Reddit, this is where I need help: What could he have meant by ""I don't know what's out there"" (he himself could not tell me what he meant)?

I'll be very blunt, it means he wants to fuck other girls, and him not being able to tell you what he meant is just him not having enough balls to tell you that he wants to fuck other girls."
8,"Yeah, she wants Mitchell. Maybe she always did, and that's why she agreed to this threesome in the first place. And she's gonna ruin Michelle's and his life to get him. Or try to. In reality, unless Mitchell does some weird 180, she's gonna lose Michelle (I would walk away from my ""friend"" and never look back), and Mitchell and Michelle are gonna have their happiness destroyed. All so that their guest star can attempt to play Father Knows Best with a childfree guy. (An irresponsible one, because why the hell would he do that without a condom?!)

OP, you can be selfish or do the right thing. If you're selfish, I cannot imagine anyone here can tell you the magic combination of words that will make any of this dumpster fire okay. "
9,"If you want to live on your own, do it. Don't feel guilty  and cave into his needs/wants. He should be happy that you want your own independence and time to yourself. It's not like you can't see him every week. It's not like you're living in another state."
10,"Disappointment, perhaps. You've just found out that the man you love has a really awful, insane side to him. Geez, what was his plan if you had his baby and he discovered that nothing changed  and he was still cf? Stay with you, but resent the kid? Or bail and leave you as a single mom? "
11,[removed]
12,"Don't listen to that guy trying to attack you lol. You're not doing anything wrong.

Break up with her. **She does not truly want to nor will she ever change.** I'm sorry OP. You can love someone and they can still be wrong/incompatible with you. "
13,"This is a good plan, don't keep secrets. Nobody likes to found out a secret after they've just committed their life to a person, even if it's seemingly a positive secret."
14,"This goes beyond just behaving badly. Your behavior is erratic. **You slashed his tires**. 

If you want a happy life, your absolute top priority has to be getting professional mental health care for your issues. Your behavior isn't just seriously damaging your interpersonal relationships, it's gotten to the point where you're doing things you can be arrested for. 

You need help. Desperately."
15,"Your husband gave you an emphatic ""no"" -- I'm not sure why this is still a question?

Tell her he said no, it's his house too, and your marriage comes first. "
16,"This is the answer. Tell your wife immediately. Regardless of how you handle things, transparency in your own relationship is essential.

As far as how to handle things, I'd approach things carefully. I get the impression that a lot of the people telling you to shut your ex down hard have never been in a coparenting situation. Often enduring a degree of otherwise-unacceptable behaviour is the price you pay to keep your kids' lives running smoothly.

You and your wife need to work out what boundaries you're both comfortable with, and how to most effectively enforce them. This is a sensitive situation and should be treated as such."
17,You'll be in a better position to help your family in the future if you go to college and get a degree and good career out of it!
18,"&gt;She thinks hobbies should only be participated once or twice a week. The rest of the time should be spent doing things together.

This is just ridiculous.  How much time do you spend together during the week?  Its one thing if you are spending all your free time alone, quite another if you are spending plenty of time with her already.  I think alot of this comes down to what she thinks ""together"" time is.  Is it doing things you mutually enjoy?  or are they basically her hobbies/interests that she doesn't want to do alone?"
19,He means the ex has a right to feel petty because he was essentially cheated on by your girlfriend. 
20,Feel completely free to text him that it's over. And also feel free to be away in another city or at a friend's place for the week when you do.
21,"Yep. Way past time to cut her loose. You don't owe her anything, OP, not even an explanation. Try to get right with that in your head and don't allow yourself to be manipulated. If you try to give her an explanation, she'll make excuses and promises and pull you back in. Protect yourself and your life."
22,Do you really want to be in a marriage where your in-laws expect to make this kind of decision for you? 
23,"Well, he's made his choice then. Its going to be painful, but realistically, you will find someone else. It could be a dodged bullet tbh because his parents sound awful and imagine having to deal with them for the rest of your life! "
24,[removed]
25,"I want to preface this by saying that I work with kids and am around them and parties so I am not some anti child individual.

Honestly, I think they want to avoid the parties with children and I don't really blame them. It can be tough being around people with kids or a place with a lot of kids. Some might feel as though they don't know what to do or say. I feel like this and I take care of kids. This is because a lot of parents have different parenting styles and rules etc. It can be overwhelming if you are not familiar with how the kids interact and like to be interacted with.

Kids also can add an intense dynamic. If these people are already somewhat on the fence about kids, then they go to a party where they require a lot of attention, that can be uncomfortable. Maybe they want to chill and talk but then the kids tip over something and then you have to clean something up, then after a while they might not feel they get to be with you. 

Some people just don't like kids and thats okay. They are loud and like tornado's that have their own emotions that can become intense at times. Some people are just uncomfortable around that.

I get what you are saying about them supporting you but if you're having family gatherings with 15-20 kids in attendance, that greatly changes the party and dynamic greatly. That is a lot of kids with a lot of parents and yelling and running and everything that comes with kids. It can be really exhausting instead of a chill get together. 

I don't think you should take it too personally. Now if you threw some parties without kids and they ignore you, then I would re-evaluate. I didn't see the ages of the children mentioned but if they are older, maybe there is someone in the group you are closer with, you can invite them to a park or something and you guys can sit at a bench eating lunch, drinking coffee, whatever, while you watch your kid play; granted they are old enough to navigate a park easily by themselves. That way, they are more comfortable around your family dynamic but you aren't just chasing after kids.  "
26,"&gt; If I go ""Lol it's nothing, I fell"" I'm worried it's gonna look like I'm trying to hide that my boyfriend hit me or something...

Yes, that is what people are likely to assume especially when they smell whiffs of deception.  A trueish but abridged version will also stand up long termshould coworkers hear about this 4th hand."
27,"Okay, but masturbation machine?

Please elaborate?"
28,"Don't change your habits, and don't move out. This is Rich's problem to manage. It has nothing to do with you.

If you stopped having sex, and instead, you cuddled on the couch with your boyfriend, Rich would start getting upset about that. If you told Rich that from now on, you'd leave the house to have sex, and go to a hotel, and then you started smiling and giggling before you left the house, Rich would get upset and tell you that he knew why you were leaving the house, and you'd have to stop going to a hotel having sex and being so gleeful about it because it was making him feel bad. 

I can understand not wanting to hear moans and wails. That is a reasonable request. But putting on music or a loud TV show is absolutely acceptable, it muffles the sex noises, and as long as you're being quiet and respectful, Rich has nothing more to say. He does not get to tell you what you can or can't do in your room. At that point, everything is just in his imagination, and if he's imagining you having sex, then that's on him, and that's creepy as fuck. And he needs to cut that shit out. Tell him that you are profoundly uncomfortable with his lack of respect, and that from this point forward, he is not to talk to you about your sex life at all."
29,She could have at least called. Then if he starts to beg she can hang up. An email is really impersonal.
30,"If she wasn't the best mom to you growing up, isn't as responsible as you (or your husband?), and tries to regularly push her agenda without respect toward your husbands boundaries, then no wonder he doesn't like her and doesn't want her around much."
31,"Yeah, it's weird how people -- including the OP -- kind of treat this lady like a delicate, whiny child who needs to be coddled. She's 'scared' to work? Well, yeah, a lot of people are before getting their first job. That's no excuse. She is a full grown adult and there is no reason OP should tolerate her dad's wife mooching off of her and staying in HER house for free for absolutely no reason. "
32,Are you referring to Alienation of Affection laws in regard to the wife suing the sister? I know some states still have those.
33,"I've experienced this situation a lot given my job and I know that sometimes people focus on the craziest of stuff as a coping mechanism (for example a dad who who's baby was dying and he was obsessed about his parking meter running out - it was clear he was getting hysterical though).

This doesn't sound the same. They don't get calculated, they get very ditzy and super focused on the other thing and sort of not relating it to the main issue (the dying person). It's like they're distracting themselves. OPs father not allowing her to say goodbye properly and rushing the turning off of vents doesn't sound like that so I stand by my he's a gobshite statement"
34,Dress your own damn kid sometimes. End of problem. 
35,Agree. Be vague. Most people in their later 20s mature and start real careers and this sharing of income info will slow. 
36,"See the thing you aren't comprehending is that YOU are being hurtful to the one you love.  You think hurting someone is just with words. You are hurting him with your actions but you completely don't see it and dismiss it.  YOU ARE HURTING HIM.  Just because you don't do it with words doesn't mean you aren't doing it.  When you ignore someone who asks you to stop doing something, you hurt them. That's a blow.  When you do something you know they hate, in public to cause drama, that's a blow.  

Don't think because you don't yell or call him names you are an innocent victim here.  You are hurting him and think he's the monster for ""beating up your brain"" when your actions are just as careless and hurtful.  

THAT'S what you don't comprehend. "
37,"&gt; I do make more than her, but I have other responsibilities that I pay for. I have family that I send money too, and I have student debt as well.

Put the money concerns out of your mind. It is the least of your problems. 

The main problem is that this girl is beyond selfish, and nasty, too.  She attacked you because your ex had blond hair.  What an underhanded attack. You can't even answer it because it is so illogical.  Leave this relationship far behind. 

I need to add that since you have only been together for 8 months and she has already shown her true nature, drop her now and take that burden off your back."
38,If I had a 6 year old on my inner thigh I would have surgery too.
39,"She's 32, so I'm guessing the timeline for kids is pretty short, yes? 

In her mind there's probably a lot of ""why bother""- why bother getting a job she'll just have to quit?"
40,"&gt; student center.

Is this the Dean of Students?  Or Dean of Student Affairs?

As /u/No_Bullshit_Advice says, the Dean of Students / Student Affairs is where you need to be going with this.  Also, if your university has a student ""Ombudsman / Ombudsperson""  that would be the person to contact.

Starting with reports at the Dean of Students should cover your behind in the event that she does something weird at the university. "
41,"Welcome to the working world dude! You gotta get some thick skin if you're going to be working directly with customers. That is honestly a super minor thing

You're gonna see 999 things that seems stupid and that don't make sense to you. Just stfu and do what your boss says. No one likes a smart ass 17 year old.

Also, why did you feel to need to tell us that it is mostly white cis males that come in?!"
42,"He had just turned 30. I mean it all makes sense.... the dude was immature and so were all of his friends. Believe me, this was not his first rodeo with acid... he's had plenty of experiences. Just this time it was only a bad one and unfortunately planned by one of his friends who I assume thought it would be funny."
43,"LOL.. okay well here's the deal. You don't trust him any more. Period.  So whether he's cheating on you, or doing porn, or drugs, whatever, evidence is irrelevant.  You don't trust him any more.  And without trust, your relationship is down the drain anyway. "
44,"And, shock horror, thanks to the miracle of hair dye people don't necessarily keep the colour they were born with."
45,"You clearly have no idea how pregnancy and childbirth can affect a woman's body. Childbirth can really weaken the pelvic floor causing bladder and incontinence issues. Assisting your partner by being courteous shouldn't be a problem, but it is for them. 

"
46,"Yeah dude, from the way you talk about this woman, she does NOT sound like the love of your life. You're wasting your life away by staying in this relationship."
47,"""wrong and strong"" means that she's emotionally connected to him, and can't see herself breaking that bond, even for her husband.

Sounds like his marriage is breaking up and if your wife is crushing on him it's got all the makings of a disaster.   No telling what she's telling him, he might think your marriage isn't her ""ideal"" so he might be thinking he's getting the OK from the tower to land.  

When you are in a marriage you put the relationship above yourself, that's the only way it can work, and she's putting herself about the relationship, if that doesn't change this isn't going to work out.  "
48,[deleted]
49,She shouldn't NEED him. She needs her husband that she chose and married haha perhaps you should remind her of that. That you and her made a commitment to each other and that you're the one who has taken on the responsibility of meeting her needs. 
50,"But really, the issue here *is* that she can't. She's not mentally in a good spot to, she doesn't know his job... I have no idea why he even wants her to, unless he has a hankering to be lazy and then end up looking foolish because it'll understandably look as though someone who doesn't know what they're doing did it. "
51,"No, you don't. Be sympathetic. She's probably upset too, she failed at something that meant something to her."
52,"They never will.  All the incentives, every single one of them, point to continuing to mooch.  They need to take on significant hardship to leave, under significant pressure, and where is that pressure going to come from now that Mom is in the hospital?

There's no magic here.  Reddit can't make your brothers into successful adults for you.  Family mooches simply never leave without being forced."
53,"&gt; But today, I was searching my personal email for something unrelated, and I came across an email I'd sent him just after I found out. I was still uncovering all the lies. I had asked him why he lied, and how much more he planned on hurting me.

Delete and remove anything which is associated to him. You come so far, don't be dragged down by this unnecessary anchor."
54,"$450 is an expensive asshole detector, but it might be worth it."
55,"I'd be more than happy to help him with it. But for him, it's all or nothing. And it's not like he's walking me to the bathroom or helping me in the shower. At this point, he doesn't need to do much for me. Before the surgeries, I had set up my house so that I don't have to lift or cook or anything else i can't do. When he comes home from work, he asks if there's anything i need from him, i say no, and then we watch TV or he plays video games. "
56,"I totally get this feeling, I really, really do, but for me if I have an inappropriate crush on a guy who is already in a relationship, the fastest way to get rid of it is to get to know his SO as an actual person, and not just someone he's mentioned or (even worse) complained about. About ninety percent of the time I'll end up really liking the SO, and it makes my crush vanish entirely. 

By going on a double date, you'll be indirectly forcing your wife to get to know Work Husband's actual wife as a real person, and it might just do the trick."
57,"When you see a tick sucking your blood, what do you do? Well, you have a human-sized tick feeding on you!"
58,"You haven't mentioned a single good quality yet.  Everything you've told us about him has been negative.  So what ARE his good qualities?

Wait, it doesn't matter what they are.

The good stuff in a relationship is not there to balance out the bad stuff.  The good stuff is the normal stuff that should be in any relationship.  The bad stuff is just bad.

You could have the greatest sandwich ever made, with the finest gourmet ingredients, but if there's tiny bit of turd smeared on it, it's still a shit sandwich."
59,"&gt;He swears it was to teach me a lesson of what could happen

this is so stupid. of course you know it COULD happen. and while i don't agree with the idea of leaving your windows down (IMO that actually does make it easier to steal b/c a thief wouldn't have to deal with breaking the windows) i still think what he did was idiotic and rude. he sat there at your home all that time KNOWING that you were freaking out over the fact that your car was gone. that is all kinds of fucked up.

i'll tell you one thing i would do immediately: take away the key he has to your home."
60,"This. This is abusive, uncalled for, and just plain wrong. Not to mention asking you to do part of his job for him is unethical as hell."
61,"You need to be direct. You're going to great lengths for her (that commute isn't fun) and saving her money. Tell her you need to be compensated for your expenses. If she says she'll pay you later, let her know that until you have the money in your account you will not be babysitting. Even good people can get lazy and take the path of least resistance, so I'm not saying you need to be angry or think less of her, but you do need to insist you are treated fairly. That is the bare minimum of what she owes you. Don't accept any guilt trips as payment. "
62,"I agree that OP should be cautious if not suspicious, but it's worth pointing out that there is a hyper-religious subculture that equates homosexuality with just general deviancy- it might not have taken much for kids raised in that environment to buy that a person who was gay might also be involved in drugs and prostitution. I mean obviously that's a terrible and wildly incorrect belief, but a lot of people have it."
63,"&gt; I think either OP wants kids a by more than she's letting on

This is what I'm wondering--either she wants kids or she doesn't want kids or something, but she's got a lot of feelings about kids and is working them out by doting on her niblings and then overanalyzing every interaction with their parents."
64,"I wouldn't be so sure; if you're truly the ""only one"" in your sister's life, she may have done it on purpose because she sees your fiancée as a threat to your relationship and she's desperate to complete for your attention against the person she sees as ""taking her brother away from her."" This isn't to say that your sister is a bad person, but if she already has issues-which you can't deny she DOES- psychological damage can make people do crazier shit. By the way, this is an explanation, NOT an excuse. I'm sorry about whatever happened to your sister, but she still needs to take responsibility to get the help she needs to move on. You're setting a really bad precedent here, and you need to fix this while you can."
65,"Seriously, dude, this needed to happen YESTERDAY. Please listen to all the women chiming in here, since you posted this looking for insight, and PUT YOUR FIANCEE FIRST. Or you WILL find yourself single.

"
66,"To me, it sounds like you're trying way too hard. You're so focused on locking down a serious relationship with your perfect Christian woman, that it probably comes across as desperation. I think you are missing the point of relationships - they are *built*, not *found*. In other words, you're putting the cart before the horse.

Stop looking for a relationship. Stop using relationships as a measure of self worth. Stop speed dating. Stay the hell off eharmony. Go do something you love in the company of other people that love that same thing, and connections are sure to form.

Not romantic connections! Just connections. If one of them develops into more, great! But if not, your life will still be full of rich human interaction. And hey, maybe one of those people knows a really great girl at their church that they could introduce you to... if you see where I'm going here.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that women don't like the kind of guy that posts novels on Reddit about how they can't find a girlfriend. Above all else, people are most attracted to people that are happy being alone. Go become someone that attracts people through your passion for life, and everything else will fall in place."
67,[removed]
68,"The qualification is just so she understands you don't mean ""Stop"". If she doesn't know that going it, you could easily end up giving her that message. 

Seriously, you need to talk to her straight up about off us this. Don't try to 'handle' her, have an actual discussion where you ask lots of questions and really listen to the answers."
69,"I would say the amount of home stuff she does has increased marginally since the move. Probably close to 50/50 since I did more of that stuff before the move. 

I do definitely feel the resentment starting to bubble up beneath the surface. I need to have this conversation sooner rather than later."
70,You guys are making the right decision. I wouldn't want that guy to live with me either.
71,There's nothing more powerless than a manager after you quit. You're free to talk back if you want. Mostly I'd avoid her.
72,"Holy shit dude. How much counseling are you getting? I don't think it's enough.

Please keep in mind that while you have had this all happen, none of it is your fault. Sending you internet bro-hugs dude."
73,"Make sure to take your half in the checking account into your own checking separate checking account before you tell her you're divorcing her. Consult with a lawyer of course but from stories I've heard, if the spouse is pissed the money will be all gone when they both meet with lawyers. "
74,"Your sister is an adult and needs to learn that actions come with consequences, and that you cannot expect other people to bail you out when you make bad decisions."
75,"You should have left your sister to fend for herself since she was already so far away from you.  It might be a different story if she was 5 minutes down the road, but in these circumstances you should have been at the hospital for your future wife.  Your sister is an adult who chose to get drunk and needs to learn how to handle herself-- she will never learn how to grow up and handle her business if you're always ready to leap to her rescue and clean up her mess.  Your fiancé is completely right to be upset--you've shown her that she comes second to your drunk juvenile little sister, what a shame."
76,"&gt; My initial reaction to this was Jay was being resentful that we had the freedom to spend our money where we wanted, while he's supporting his family because Christie decided to not return to work midway through her mat leave.

I'd say it's 100% likely that he's resentful, but so what? That's his problem, not yours. Just keeping living your lives and making the choices that are best for you, and Jay can sit on a tack. Every time he makes a passive-aggressive comment about how ""easy"" and ""carefree"" your child-free lives are, just smile and think about how pathetic that is. The only person who looks bad in the end is Jay."
77,"I have an off-topic question for you: what is your sister's dating life like? How have you interacted with her boyfriends? 

If you two weren't related is she someone you'd want to be with? "
78,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

"
79,"Ugh, no useful advice, just had to say that my last ex was like this and it was one of the many nails in the coffin. He'd pick apart my word choice instead of trying to listen to what I was trying to convey. He was raised (by his parents and grad programs) to believe that precise language is the answer to all conflict. And I have a language processing disorder (autism). Soooo... That was a struggle."
80,"Let's say you are a hideous blob. 

Even hideous blobs deserve to be happy. I've seen 300lb women with giant noses and receding hair lines in happy relationships. They have husbands that love  them, support them. 

You need to set the bar higher for yourself. CONTINUE GOING TO THERAPY. This will help you so much. I also have PTSD and after about two years in therapy I can honestly say my self esteem is much, much better. "
81,"I truly believe you need therapy or counseling of some sort. You've just potentially ruined this girl's life when you could have just ignored the note, or spoke with her. 

Alot of people get bullied in highschool, you're paranoia is unfounded. If you have really been beaten up why haven't you contacted the police?"
82,"Well you sucked a guys dick for a handful of money, and your boyfriend is now taking sexual advantage of you.  Any angle I look at it from, this relationship should end."
83,[removed]
84,[removed]
85,"You're right, but that doesn't change the large majority of my points. I think people in the last thread were wrong not to take the husband's possible reaction into account."
86,"I think the point was that OP thought her bf's first language was English, but he's not fluent in English. "
87,You need to stop thinking of your sister as a child. She's a grown woman now and her getting drunk is like not even 100th of the importance of your wife having major emergency surgery. It's actually scary to me how you can't see this.
88,"Let me leave you a link, you only need your SSN, a photo of your ID and a bank statement to sign up for bi-weekly updates. "
89,"You know, it's very thickheaded of you to respond: ""Oh, I guess my sister isn't my family/I should feel NO responsibility for her."" It's defensive and pig-headed. The problem with what you did is the fact that your sister's problem was 1) not a big deal and 2) easily resolvable without your help. It's not like you're looking at proportionate crises and facing a difficult choice. It's the fact that you're willing to put dumb drunk bullshit over a major surgery and seem to be insisting that it's a difficult choice."
90,"No, she is responsible for her own anger. And she needs to manage it in a mature manner and not act like an immature child in front of you and her parents. 

If she is hurt by what you did, she needs to USE HER WORDS.. you learn this in kindergarten damn it! 
I cannot even believe she invited you out, acted like a grumpy child, then called you and said you failed her because you agreed to an invitation she gave to you because you should've... that is even too insane and passive aggressive for me to finish typing. 

8 months.. if you think this is as bad as it gets after 8 months, you're very wrong sir. 

Good luck.. yoga is great for stress, you're gonna need it. "
91,"I wouldn't consider it a bullying sub. I've found a fair amount of kindness from people there, especially as I move through my own weightloss journey. The majority of users on that sub (there are always outliers) dislike the logic that people use to make excuses for an ""inability"" to lose weight, not the people themselves. There are always people on that subreddit that target individuals, not ways of thinking, but there are also weekly threads where people can get help and advice and work through some of the ways they have unhealthy relationships with food. Even just reading posts (though I must admit I mainly only visit the comment sections of the weekly threads) has been incredibly helpful in keeping me motivated and reminding me of different ways that I'm thinking about food and my own weight in an unhealthy way. It reminds me that I have control over my body and even though different people have slightly different levels of control, we're not slaves to what our body ""wants""."
92,Agreed. He can't have his wife and his addiction. He has to pick one.  
93,"First of all, I'm really proud of you for getting through the things you've been through. I have also been through assault and emotional abuse. I'd really like to recommend The Chimp Paradox, which is a book about mind management. It has really helped me understand and manage my negative emotions and anxiety, and has been a great help in restoring order and happiness to my life."
94,He didn't. Odds are the gift was never even given to the son. He just pocketed it.
95,"All I can think after reading this, OP, is that you need to change your phone number and drop this woman like a bad habit. Because she IS a bad habit, and will bring only misery into your home should you let her in."
96,"It doesn't really matter if *we* think it's inappropriate. You are uncomfortable. Next time, tell her it is making you uncomfortable, apologize if you are misinterpreting, but for the sake of clarity you would like her to make certain not to approach that line again. Don't be aggressive. Once you do that, tell your wife it happened and that you directly shut it down. That should be the end of it."

99,"At the same time, according to the CDC intimate partner violence study a full 10% of men have experienced at least attempted reproductive coercion. It's slightly lower for women. It's not that rare. But I agree if you're really worried about this you should be done."
100,"None of that is a reason to treat HER badly. Nothing stopped you making a phone call to say ""cant make the date"".

Also... dude, your mother is literally destroying every aspect of your life: finances, depression, homeless, lost gf....  is your mother (the woman who ABUSED you!) really worth it?  What woman wants to be tied to a man whose whole life is spent and thrown away on providing for his criminal mother? 

Dude, you really, really need to cut your mother out of your life. She is STILL abusing you"
101,"You've lost her, dude. The girl you loved doesn't exist any more; she's been replaced by this new super religious person who you dont know and with whom you no longer share core values.



&gt; I 100% respect her for whatever she wants to believe in 

Good, but sadly that's not mutual respect: she's flat-out said she doesn't respect your beliefs/lack of beliefs and is asking that you change them.

You gotta end this now."
102,"Your behavior was out of line, of course. His behavior was so fucking out of line it's ridiculous. 

Surely you guys had talked about what happens when someone violates a boundary like you did? Isn't there some kind of contingency plan you guys have in place to help you deal with the repercussions? I don't think it included him calling you names. 

Personally I don't think he's suited for this kind of thing if this is his reaction."

108,"I'm not sure why no one has suggested this yet, but I'm tagging it along on the top comment.

I think you need to suggest marriage counseling to your wife. Frame it to her like you want to rebuild trust. It seems like she has a lot of lingering resentment against you and baggage with her family, and is taking it out on you. This seems like the kind of situation where couples counseling could really help her understand how her actions are hurting the relationship. And she will be willing to go because she thinks it's your fault.

However if she's simply jealous and doesn't allow you to have female friends, not sure if counseling can solve that. I think this advice only works if the reason she's behaving like this is that she's still hurting from the Ashley Madison hack."

He doesn't want to marry you. Do with that what you will."

114,"For me, it's a pattern of taking over tasks without asking, because my dad disagrees with how I want to do something, doesn't trust me to get it done on time, and/or believes that he will do a better job.

It's controlling, condescending behavior."

116,"Not sure how each country works, I'm in Australia and when people rent a house/apartment, they'll pay first month's rent and a bond when they first move in. Price varies and the bond is basically a security deposit incase any damage occurs or is left behind, most usually you have the bond returned once you leave. 

Definitely read your lease again and see what it states, double check any of that fine print! It doesn't sound right to me, especially the painting and pressure cleaning. Whenever I've rented, getting the carpets professionally cleaned was a requirement, but that's about then only part I'd be expecting you'll possibly find in the lease. 

Hope this doesn't wind up costing you a huge amount because it absolutely shouldn't! Good luck!"
117,"&gt; I'm stuck in this stupid country with my only group of friends in a dinky town 3 hours away.

Would your friends be willing to let you stay with them while you get back on your feet? How about family?

&gt; What do I do with all of the photos? I can't stop crying.

Put them in some kind of locked box, and give it to a friend for safekeeping until you're over the breakup. Being in possession of those photos isn't helping you right now.

&gt; I can't even go here and give advice anymore because clearly I don't know how to have a good relationship.

If anything, you have even more of a right to be here giving advice. You gained experience from this, which you could use to help others in similar situations.

&gt; I feel like a fraud. All of his friends liked his new Facebook photo and a lot had heart reactions- just goes to show how they never liked me in the first place...

Are you sure that they realize you broke up? Maybe they just liked the picture itself, and not the implications of it."
118,"This, so much this. It's a great idea theoretically to put locks on doors etc. But having come from a volatile relationship with my mother who decided everything I worked for was rightfully hers, because  ""she gave birth to me, I owed her for putting a roof over my head, food in my stomach etc. etc"". (Even though I was contributing 50% of earnings to rent, bills and her habits)


As soon as I tried to lock things away after explaining how I felt, she trashed my room, broke my things, threw everything out and filmed it,showed off to anyone who visited how ""messy her room is, She'll never understand the value of money etc....""

I ended up storing items elsewhere until I saved enough to get out.

120,"Your older friends and family members are fucking insane, this is not remotely normal and this dude is absolutely one billion percent going to hit you in the future and blame you for making him do it."
121,"&gt;The problem of course is that I can't just tell everyone to fuck off.

You absolutely can. 

Ask them why they want you to be with someone who thinks you're there to be put down and picked up at their pleasure? Why they want you to be with someone who has that little consideration for you."
122,You don't get to tell someone when their trust has or has not been violated. That's a very personal thing that everyone has a right to determine for themselves. 
123,"Please do not marry someone who you cannot bring yourself to stand up to and who calls you worthless. I know how it feels to just think ""I'll just swallow my feelings and go along with it to avoid a fight"". I did that for almost 14 years with an emotional abuser. Please don't do what I did. Get out now before you have kids with this man who walks all over you and lets his family do it too. "
124,"Yes, I have. Every single time. I don't start having sex if I'm that tired that I will need to stop halfway through. I'm not expecting them to be psychic, I'm expecting them to have an awareness of their own bodies. That's not being a perfectionist. And yeah, I'm in a long term relationship. 

I didn't say that I would say a partner couldn't orgasm unless I did. I said that I would want that to be communicated if they anticipated that they wouldn't have the energy to get me off too. Then either person has the option to say yeah that's cool or no thanks, maybe just take care of yourself. Of course consent can be withdrawn, but that's not really what we're talking about here. "
125,I feel like that's something he wouldn't need to keep secret from his wife.
126,[deleted]
127,"&gt; So at that point, or at any point during the week, did you respond to him ""Actually, I'm tapped out on moving, I'm going to see my own family instead""?

Nope. Because up until 10:45am Sunday, I didn't know I was going to see my family at all. My brother's wife simply said ""we're going to [my twin]'s house. Since you're not doing much here, do you want to come? We'll only be an hour or two""... of course, it was a nice surprise when I got there, to see my parents were also there. Hence me taking a little longer than I thought.

He definitely cannot say no to his parents. He fears letting them down. 

I hate letting him down, but I also needed to recognise what was more important to me that morning. Briefly letting him down, or missing out on seeing my twin and parents. Definitely latter. He'll eventually get over it. My parents are going overseas on Thursday, and I would never forgive myself if it got to 3 months without seeing them.

"
128,"I think the solution here, and moving forward, is to say no to things. As in ""We're helping my parents move Sunday."" ""Well you have fun, but I'm going to try to see my parents that day, cheers!""  

Or you show up to the house, see that everything is still EVERYWHERE, and say to your boyfriend, ""I'm happy to help with the boxes, so let me know when everything is packed up, but I can't help with the packing today.""  

Or in general ""Boyfriend, the way your family moves house makes me anxious and frustrated. I'm done helping them move/ I'm only coming to the part of the move where the carrying of boxes happens/ I'm happy to help prepare, but I'm done helping the day of.""  

The thing that stood out in your story was the passive lack-of-communication. You were grumpy and frustrated that your boyfriend's family is so disorganized (legit!) and so you passively avoided doing stuff you didn't want to do in favor of something that was important to you (less legit!). You are allowed to draw boundaries, but you have to actually DRAW them out loud."
129,Did you remind her that she chose that dress for you?
130,"Yeah, but money &lt; getting away from crazy. "
131,"She could be crazy head over heels in love with you and want to marry you tomorrow morning and still not want to give up her job for you. Idk what kind of world you live in where she'd probably do it herself if she saw something there - it's just a job. I know some guys get all weird about prostitution, but at the end of the day its just a job for her like bagging groceries, and you wouldn't expect any other profession would want give up their career for you if they saw a relationship going anywhere?? "
132,"So you breakup if you feel that way. You don't up the ante. 

You are creating a shitty cycle. Instead of being able to say ""I went to your grandfather's funeral because I care for you."" and have an example of the consideration you'd like him to have; you instead are giving him more reasons to double down on his behavior. ""She wasn't even there for me. Why should I be there for her?""

What has his family done that makes you not like them? There aren't many examples of that in your comments. "
133,"If you don't trust him, leave. Trust is the most crucial part. If I didn't trust my boyfriend he'd be gone in 10 minutes."
134,"&gt;It seems almost like it's because he's spent a lot more time single than in a relationship and he's still learning how and when he should take his partner's feelings into account. 

This really jumped out at me, because as someone who was single most of her adult life, and married someone who also didn't date much before we met...you learn this stuff from nonromantic relationships your whole life. You learn that people don't like it when you're late and that they don't want to spend time with that one co-worker and that they get annoyed when you put your feelings above theirs. Yeah, romantic relationships are different, but he's 33, he's not brand new at having to consider others' feelings. 

So I get that you don't want to hear ""break up"" and I'd advise more like...think about how long it's taken him to start learning these lessons. Think about whether he's the same kind of inconsiderate with his friends and family, like, is it his nature or is it his behavior WITH YOU. And understand that either way, you're in this role of teaching and correcting him - one year and you've had three near-dealbreakers plus a handful of annoyances you've had to bring up? That honestly sounds exhausting, and it's  not going to get better overnight...ask yourself whether you're okay with keeping that up, and for how long before he gets it on his own. "
135,"How so? Everyone in this thread is trying to explain to you how so and you're not listening, so I'm not going to bother.

What I will say is this: you're an adult now, in an adult relationship, but you're still using the unhealthy relationship skills you developed as a teenager. If either of you ever realize how unhealthy this relationship is and leave it, you are *both* going to find dating as adults very challenging. For the sake of your present relationship and potential future relationships, please consider getting help.

Even though you don't think you need it, if this many internet strangers have independently come to the conclusion that you're not a healthy partner, please consider that we're seeing something that you're not."
136,"&gt;I don't understand why you harbor so much hatred towards her though.

I don't? I don't understand where people are getting this from. 

Just because I don't want to spend my time around her or pretend to be civil and polite, when I don't have to, doesn't mean I hate her. I'd just rather not spend my time on someone that's nothing and no one to me. "
137,She probably assumed you wouldn't scoop a number from a twenty-something random you met at a bar when you were on a guy's weekend.
138,"Unless you want to have a baby on your own, you really need to consider your options right now. Abortion, adoption, etc. It doesn't sound like you can support yourself or a baby on your own. "
139,"Acknowledging he fucked up is a good first step though.  As is deleting the video.

You're not our of the woods, for sure."
140,"&gt;My mom always believes she is right and gets extremely angry when someone confronts her. 

&gt;I always had a great relationship with my mom. 


Oh, was it because you never stood up to her? Because this is what it looks like to me. 

Yes, your mother stole your money.  And maybe she thought about paying you back in the beginning,  but she reasoned herself into thinking she needs it more. 

Speak to your father,  use legal means if possible.  Your mother chose money over you. "
141,"&gt; I think it's a big leap for you to decide we aren't mature enough for something.

YOU HAVE 'HALL PASSES' AND GET OUT OF MONOGAMY FREE SEX LISTS.

You are NOT mature about the care and respect BOTH partners deserve and are necessary to maintain a healthy relationship. "
142,"&gt; Did you tell this ""potential friend"" you are happily married with children in your conversation?

&gt; I was wearing my wedding ring and my phone background (which she saw and briefly commented on) was of my wife and me. She knew I was married.

Translation: No, I did not tell her I was married and have children.

153,"If you look at the thread you will see OP making that kind of response multiple times until people started to gang up on him and pile on like you're doing still. At a certain point multiple ""misunderstandings"" you continue to correct in a row start to look an awful lot like attacks.

People get defensive sometimes when they're attacked. "
154,"No, don't say that you'll get another cat.

I had a cat like cat #1. She was terrified of all other cats. My sister had a cat like cat #2. My cat was terrified of her. My other sister had 2 cats who kept to themselves when visiting. My cat didn't want anything to do with them either."

163,"She didn't stop it. They had sex the day before she left to come and see you. That is fucked up and if the internship hadn't finished, she would still be cheating on you now.

164,Omg please dont listen to this poster. This is how eating disorders start. Please talk to your doctor. 
165,"Just be honest that homeownership isn't all its cracked up to be. Its more work than renting, you're limited in your options for moving/relocating, property value appreciation isn't anywhere near what it used to be, the first 15 years of a 30-year loan your payments are more interest than principal, etc.

Unless you're really liquid financially, I don't see any reason to buy a home unless you're starting a family and plan to live there for 20+ years. 

Do you have an accountant or financial adviser that you could put them in touch with? Even a brief conversation with someone assessing their finances putting the kibosh on it could be helpful. A tax accountant could be great, as he could dispel the common misconception that ""owning a home really helps with your taxes"". It helps less the less money you make, and at any level, its wildly overblown. Ten thousand dollars in interest and real estate taxes might only increase your refund by a few hundred bucks."
166,"OOOPS, just saw in another poster's comment that in OP's post history there is one where he emotionally cheated with co-worker. Welp, that will explain why the wife is not so comfortable with his ""alone"" time. "
167,"You said you met her on a swinger app, and were a little surprised that she seems to be moving quickly. I think it's silly that you even have a little concern, since she would probably assume things should get sexual quickly because of the nature of meeting on a swinger app.

Now of course if she still doesn't realize that after you guys tell her that would be cause for concern. I wouldn't hold it against her in anyway if things are like you described though. You definitely have to be explicit with what you want and you're entitled to that, but don't discount her before she knows what you guys want."
168,"I am a little puzzled by this.

What does your partner actually work as?

He can't help in his family medical practice as he isn't qualified.

Quite honestly you should all just meet up on neutral ground and make it plain he's not able to follow in daddy's footsteps and doesn't want to."
169,"If you're in a relationship with a partner that you're expecting to change, then you're doing it wrong. You love the person for who they are, not what you want them to be.

That goes for anything, btw.

So your BF is a pushover and non-confrontational. That's him. He's not going to miraculously just change. My Fiance has social anxiety and avoids social interaction when I'm not around (or her close best friends). I'm not going to expect her to just change and become a social butterfly. That's just who she is. And I accept that.

So you either have to accept it, or move on from this relationship. but wanting him to change to a completely different person is irrational. "
170,"your husband needs Al-anon *badly*, if he really thinks something you guys do is going to ""make"" her drink or not drink."
171,"This sounds like it was a really bad point in your relationship to be having house guests, particularly attractive female house guests. Don't blame your sister, this is entirely on your husband. The root of the issue here to me is the fact that you are in a rut in your relationship. You say you are living like roommates, and that lack of intimate contact is probably a main reason why your husband is behaving like he is. Maybe sit down with your husband and discuss everything, ask if he's willing to work on your relationship, perhaps even couple's counseling. You need to devote time to each other and try to reignite things. Maybe go for a weekend getaway, start having weekly date nights, etc."

174,"Good for you? From where I am that IS a decent amount, especially at this age. I was praising her ability to even have a job with that much responsibility + pay, since most people my age in my city struggle to find employment as new grads unless it's a shit admin role or if they have connections already. 

What OP's boyfriend makes is great; there is no denying that. I was praising her attitude while criticising HIS regarding both salaries. 

"
175,"I was more on your wife's side until you mentioned your lotto money. I think she's being unreasonable, FWIW. "
176,"Has he actually said what the fight was specifically about? He's been asked a few times and seems to always throw it back to her for ""being mad about the past.""  

She was upset so he got upset, then wandered off, then got mad no one checked on him, and now wants to leave his girlfriend and her kids 7 hours from home so he can leave one day early?  Dude...you may be being a tad dramatic here and seem mainly upset that your manipulative attempts to turn attention back to you aren't working.

I always obsessed over what my ex could possibly have been thinking when, whenever we'd fight on vacation, he'd threaten to strand me and drive himself home (usually from fights he picked and refused to be consoled about).  I'm assuming it was probably a lot like this...and it's probably no surprise that he's an ex."
177,"&gt;  And now I'm feeling lonely and scared but didn't once say ""I think I'll stay with him.""

This part is where you sound like you aren't sure if you'll leave him or not:

&gt; I feel confused and conflicted. Part of me feels like I did the right thing and this timing is good because I have my dad's full support and encouragement now. The other part of me feels like this was too early and I wasn't ready to leave him yet. I'll miss his companionship so much and all the good times we have together - it's hard to see that I might be better off alone than to have a companion and someone to share my life with. I'm terrified of the impending feeling of loneliness, especially at my age when all my friends are in couples or are newlyweds."
178,"^ Beat me to it.  I was going to say this just based on your title, but I kept reading, hoping there was some logical explanations, then gave up reading because why deal with this over a 6 week relationship?

179,"Make sure to keep a running log of your responsibilities.

Six rough months at the beginning of your career to ""prove yourself"" is okay, but if you keep doing work above your payscale and not getting compensated for it, people will learn to use you.

I was in your position too, and while I was praised for my ""flexibility"" and ""willingness to take on new/challenging/additional tasks"", at the end of the day, praise means nothing if you're not fairly paid for your 16 hour days. Definitely negotiate a raise at the end of the year. "
180,Totally thinking the same thing! I bet the prevailing thought would be that the man is entitled to his money 
181,"""No one wonders where I am or contacts me for meal plans. They have breakfast and lunch without me and by the time dinner rolls around I get a call from her friend asking if I'm coming for dinner.""

You don't know if they wonder where you are or not. Your ""gf"" probably told them you are fighting or they can tell. Your gf is their friend, not you. They were nice enough to let you know it was dinner. You have one day left, either suck it up or ask your girlfriend if she's able to get home a different way because you would like to leave. I assume you are breaking it off for good, otherwise you are just being dramatic. "
182,"&gt; Weird gym rat people...

What? Why care about other people at the gym?"
183,"If your main annoyance is her talking to you too much, that can be solved without you quitting. 

First option is to just talk to her, let her know you appreciate her friendliness but you get easily distracted and it's hard for you to refocus when you lose a train of through. 

If you're not comfortable approaching her, you can also try wearing headphones while you work and tell her you concentrate better with music. You can even not play any music if you don't want to, but I think she'll get the point. "
184,"If you can comfortably afford it and that's something you want to do, feel free to give her an allowance when you're older and more established. 

But for now, only pay her rent if you're living with her. Continuing to pay after you leave would be enabling her and that's not healthy for either of you. Encourage her to seek mental health treatment if you want to help her, but don't put yourself in a position where you struggle with your own bills because your mom feels entitled to retire early."
185,"Agreed, grooming part is shallow. Perhaps it's painful to groom it (I'll give her that one) but she is a bit childish to make OP feel like his body parts are ""gross"" "
186,"Unrelated: you're dating a dude 14 years older than you, and that's probably just a generally bad idea.  Just the idea that he's 34 and okay with dating a 20 year old should be a red flag, even to a 20 year old."
187,"They're kinda perfect for each other really. She'll continue to enable him and feel bad when he behaves stupidly/criminally. Jail will do to him what jail does best and make him more a criminal. Bright future, and one all too common."
188,"I read that part a few times and still don't fully understand. I read it as she already had sex with him, for the entire summer? I'm just super confused with the situation. "
189,"&gt; I know that I would NEVER commit my husband to a decision like that to the future/potential employer. That, to me, is the biggest overstep of boundaries.

Under any other circumstances, I would fully agree. But, I'm not going to bury my husband because he died of a heart attack at 35 and I would much rather work with less than be a widow. His big fear was money but how many 6-person households in the US can say they earn well over $200k? How many people in general? 

Part of me thinks: I married him not money and if I lose him, would it be worth it? How many panic attacks does he have before he jumps? How many times do his coworkers die or suffer catastrophic illness before he prioritizes himself? Do his kids care at the end of the day? 

He's always wanted to teach them to swim but has no time. We have a pool. We have willing children, but on Saturdays he's writing proposals and fighting with staff. What's the point of it all? 

Would I have done this normally? No. But I'm penned into a corner and my husband won't back down on this. If fear won't let him quit, then I used fear to compel him to quit. Shitty move on my part, but damn if I don't feel justified in doing it. "

194,"This is her fuck up and she's trying to take the spot light off of her and make it about you. Just continually point out that she in fact sent it and you in fact deleted it before she ever called. If she has such trust issues, maybe she should be more careful when sending nudes. Honestly, at this point it doesn't matter what jess thinks.  This whole mess is her own damned fault. If she needs to be reminded of that, remind her. Nicely of course, but don't let her shift any blame to you for something you had no control over. "
195,"If OP even politely tells her ""Stop, this is making me uncomfortable"", she probably IS going to be embarrassed, so no need to intentionally create embarassment or shame. "
196,"I literally can't agree with this more. The focus should be on building up your husband's confidence and trust in your relationship from where it was broken, not tearing you down to a level of pain and belittlement that he thinks (and you think) is deserved."
197,"&gt; When you see a tick sucking your blood, what do you do?

You tell it you love it because you know it's really a good tick deep down inside, and you go get blood transfusions because the poor tick is just *hungry* and surely if you just keep giving it more and more blood until it's full, it will transform into a prince and brilliant business man."
198,"If she's unattractive to you just because she wears her hair a certain way, are you really attracted to at all? If it's completely dependent on a hairstyle, it's not real attraction. "
199,"&gt; Sometimes they confide in me they're unhappy at home and I try to help them without crossing a boundary.

This is always going to be a boundary. DO NOT discuss this at work with ANY of these men, no matter how cool you think you are. Even with my closest guy friends we simply do not talk about relationship issues as that's a hairy line. Imagine if YOU were the girlfriend/partner of one of these men and you find out they're talking about your relationship problems to the bubbly little cute 23 year old in the office? I'd be pissed too. It IS a boundary and crosses a line, while you may have a boyfriend who doesn't care if you give this kind of intimate advice and you also feel you can provide insight, just don't. It might not be your boundary but it is their SOs boundary and you should respect that. If they come up to you and try, just say ""I don't want to be involved"" or ""Let's talk about something else"" or just interrupt the conversation or simply say you don't care. It's not your job to play individual relationship therapist.

When they insinuate incorrect things about your boyfriend, tell them that is EXTREMELY inappropriate, very correct and that they need to focus on other things...like work. Jesus. You *can* have friends but the thing that I'll tell you as a girl with guy friends and no drama, you cannot treat your guy friends the same as your girlfriends. That means relationship discussions are off the table unless both of you are single, and the one-on-one hangouts are going to be massively uncomfortable for most people. Reddit is FILLED with very liberal, understanding people who seem to not care about this stuff, but it's not a demographic representative of the actual population. Most SO's aren't going to go ""Oh cool 23F is hanging out with her male co-worker after work, I'm so glad they've made a new friend"" and that's just the facts. Group stuff is probably okay or even suggesting going on a double date, but trying to treat them like you'd treat a girlfriend, while ""technically super correct"" to most of Reddit, it's going to give you a bad time. 

Lastly, ""It's hard to find females that want to be your friend here. It's isolating and lonely."" Work isn't the **only place** to make friends. I'd try to give the girls at your work another chance and put in more effort with them- any time you feel like going to talk about John about why he has a dead bedroom, instead go try to talk with Lauren about neat stuff in your field or astrophysics or whatever cool thing you guys would talk about. Lastly, try to separate ""work"" and ""social life."" I know you spend a lot of time there but I have had a lot of co-workers who say ""I don't add coworkers on social media, we are not friends, and it's nothing personal."" And they stick to it. And they make friends outside of work through hobbies, Meetup, SO's friends/family, really just any way most people make friends. Because workplace friendships tend to end up as workplace drama. It's not the same as high school or University where part of the experience is to make friends. You're there to do the job. Right now these social interactions are interfering with your job as it is causing you to be insecure and feel isolated and lonely. So scale back the social and push forward the work and you're likely to stop stepping on toes and crossing other people's boundaries and getting gossip/rumors about you. 

Then make friends outside of work. 

Sorry if that's not the nicest advice and I'm sure a lot of people will be a bit surprised as it doesn't typically go with what's said on here most of the time, but it's realistic. You're never going to have the type of relationship you want with these guys or be able to treat them like a regular girl friend without stepping on massive toes and having drama around you. Branch out."
200,"Do you believe in an afterlife? 

If so, do you think your wife is up there angrily hoping that you stay celibate and alone for the next 50 years of your life? Isn't it more likely that, now that she's at complete peace, she wants you to be happy and have your needs met? She's on your side. And if you're lonely, then she would *want* you to find companionship.  

Do you not believe in an afterlife?  

Then your wife is gone. And life needs to go on. It's a tragedy what happened to your wife. But that incident doesn't need to take 1 more life away. You need to find happiness, companionship, and move forward because you're still alive.  

Don't be miserable and alone. Your son deserves a happy home. You deserve a happy life.  

Good luck. "
201,"I don't say this lightly, but I genuinely think she might be jealous. 

Unless there's something your bf knows that you don't. "
202,"Ok, so ""served"" is not quite the right word for that, but it doesn't really matter.

Anyway, sorry this happened to you, but you can definitely blame your boyfriend for this.  

I think it would be wise for you to get on the wife's side of this issue.  Reach out to her and offer to help, testify, etc.  Explain you were deceived and you never would have gotten involved if you had known.  That'll put you in a position where if you ask that she be discreet about the tape and about *your* reputation, she would be inclined to do you a favor."

204,"While I agree with you that this whole situation is absurd and not your problem, you do say that you've benefitted significantly from MIL's giving nature.  And MIL did hire the dog sitter for most of the time.  If you're physically capable of watching the dog for the two days, it would probably be worth it in general family goodwill.  With two small children, you'll probably be benefitting a lot from your inlaws offering free babysitting and other helpful services.  You don't want to establish yourself as somebody who doesn't reciprocate favors. 

Again, I agree with you that MIL shouldn't have let this situation develop.  But if it is a choice between watching an elderly lab for 2 days and damaging a hugely beneficial relationship with your MIL, I think you should watch the dog.  But since this is your husband's weird family and since you're pregnant, he should step up and vacuum up the dog hair afterwards, as well as help out with any errands you can't run while watching the dog.  "
205,"Well, that's one of the drawbacks of dating a good looking woman...guys are gonna flirt with her.  She can't shut down every flirt (or presumed flirt) with ""I have a boyfriend"".  That makes things very awkward.  Guys have probably been flirting with her since she was 15.  I'm sure she knows how to handle it.  If you can't deal with it then date an ugly chick."
206,"Your entire post sounds like you are just trying to justify why it's OK for you to break up a relationship by getting her to cheat. What you are doing is wrong. Completely and morally wrong. And if you start the relationship by cheating, it will likely end by cheating as well. You are showing her that you think cheating is OK and you can justify doing it. What happens when you meet a new female co-worker and have a bond with her? Will it be worth cheating for? Disrespecting a relationship for? That's the message you will be sending to this crush. Not to mention the fact that she will feel awful and blame you for her feelings, possibly even resent you. She told you she still wants to be in that relationship and you don't seem to respect her words. You are pushing her and pushing her until you get what you want. 

Just. Stop. If you really want it to work with her, be the better man, all the way through. Because maybe loser video game boyfriend is kind and loyal in his heart, and that's what she likes. You? You sound like an opportunistic home-wrecker that can't take no for an answer. 

Sorry. That was harsh. But I want you to stop before you cause a disaster that ends in everyone hurt. If it's meant to be, she'll find you. But for now, as hard as it sounds, this relationship can't happen until SHE breaks up with him. And if you really want something that can last long term, let it start legitimately and respectfully - i.e. a story you wouldn't be embarrassed to tell your friends."
207,"I like that question a lot, thank you. If I'm ever in contact with her again I will ask her that exactly. 

"
208,"&gt; Do women befriend men only if they consider their physical appearance good enough for sex?

Yes totally. That's how the term ""friendzoned"" came into being - from the distilled tears of all the men that women would only make ""friends"" with as a pretense when all they wanted was the sex. "
209,"&gt; What do you think is the catalyst for her behavior? 

Ask her. And tell her how you feel. Don't say anything accusatory because it makes the other person feel defensive, i.e. ""You're such a nag,"" but rather ""When you do/say this, it makes me feel like this/that"" and so on. "

218,"There is already a lot of good advice on here, but I have to ask why the heck do they have a dog if they can't afford to feed, clothe, and home themselves? A pet is a luxury not a necessity. 

You need to lay down some strict boundaries and expectations or they are going to take you for a ride like they have done with everyone else. 

-Your brother needs to be getting up at a decent time in order to get a job. Sleeping past 12 is ridiculous and unacceptable when you are unemployed and desperate for cash. 

-Girlfriend needs to keep up this waitressing job. If she doesn't show/gets fired whatever there are consequences. 

-They need to make long term plans. How much do they need to strike out on their own? What are they going to do about their education/careers. You need to make clear this is a SHORT TERM solution. Or else you will never get your house back. 

-They need to be contributing to the household chores. They are living rent free, it is MORE than reasonable to tell them to clean up after themselves. Right now you are giving them housing and are their cook and maid. 

-If the dog isn't crated or cared for it has to go. There is no reason for you to lose your deposit because they cannot train/take care of the animal. 

If they don't abide by your rules or drop the ball, they are out. It's as simple as that. Yes they have a hard go of it but it sounds like they have squandered many opportunities that come their way. They aren't your house guests, it's not your job to make them comfortable. Actually they should be a little uncomfortable because the goal is to get them on their feet and out. 

You can be firm and compassionate, from one big sister to another. "

220,"Plastic surgery is pretty common these days, and really not that big of a deal. If it makes them happier to have smaller noses or whatever it is, who cares? 

It really is none of your business to be so hyper-focused on their looks once they're adults, or try to tell them what they should be doing with their body, and it's equally as ridiculous to be so anti surgery as it would be to be pro surgery. If you don't want to pay for it that's your business, but your kids are near adults and will make their own decisions. They're going to learn very fast life isn't fair, and plenty of normal people get surgery. The onus isn't on your stepdaughter to be a rolemodel. I fail to see how it's a bad example that someone fixed their ears and a bump on their nose. "

222,"Glad it worked out for you.

The only thing I'd say about some of the advice I read here is that this sub is not good at advising new parents. Majority of the folks here have not dealt with parenting a newborn and therefore do not understand the practicalities of it.

For example, some people agreed with you that it was annoying for your gf to ask you to turn on the AC in the room where she was while she was changing the baby...

I have an 8 week old, very wriggly, son. When I've got him on the changing table, there is no way I'm going to be able to do anything else that's not within arms reach because I have to keep one hand on the baby. I'm used to changing him alone (we run a farm and hubby is usually outside doing farm work) so I've learned to make sure I have everything I might need set up close at hand before I do a nappie change. 

In your fiance's case though, I doubt she's had to get used to changing baby without anyone else in the house. So naturally I can see how she would ask for help with something that seems like she could easily do herself."
223,"Wait...it's too late to apply for school in the fall.  For graduate school (at a decent school) applications and interviews start in late fall through early spring.  Assuming she applies and gets in when they open the application window (Sept/Oct 2017), what is she going to do until the next fall when classes start (Aug 2018)?

Also....HOLD UP.  Paying her share of rent and food - ok, maybe.  Pay her *car lease* and *credit card*.  Holy cow, no.

She can go month to month on her lease in Vegas, or she could move to Chicago where she has family.  It's not like she has no options.  And what's going to happen if she gets into a program in Chicago?  Are you guys done?  Long distance?

I have a terrible feeling that she's going to use you to move back, get into school and then once she's going to say it doesn't feel right and it's over."
224,"While she has the right to say what she wants (barring certain legalities), she also has the right to bear the consequences of her ""free speech."" In this case, the consequences of being nasty is having someone refuse to do her a favor.

But until he decides to grow a spine, and be a man and learn to confront his parents instead of running away like a coward, this is not the man you want to commit to and I guarantee the life you have with him will not be the life you want.

232,"I agree 100%. People with healthy conflict resolution skills and respectful views of women do not even think these things, let alone say them out loud. I think if you start to watch carefully you'll start to notice him escalating his threats/controls and pushing your boundaries in other ways. That doesn't mean he's guaranteed to be full on abusive, but only you can decide if he's worth taking that risk. That type of comment, even in jest, is so horrifying to me I would be out of there.

Also, OP, you really have no idea if he abused Marie or not, no matter what his friends say. Many, if not most, abusive relationships look picture perfect from the outside.

"
233,"I don't think you should go no contact with those who associate themselves with him. However, I think you should go no contact with him and his girlfriend. This is in no way saying that his girlfriend is toxic in any way (though if she is, more reason to go no contact). But it seems as though your friends don't only view your ex as pathetic, but perhaps even his girlfriend for allowing this to happen. This could potentially make her feel extremely horrible if she's the joke of the party, especially if she has no idea that these are his reasons for having a baby. 

I think because of his actions in the past and the situation that just occurred, you should try to avoid him as best as you can. If he goes to events you are invited to, don't go. If you feel you have to or don't want to stop hanging out with friends simply because he's there, try to keep yourself busy all the time. Have someone with you, if he tries to talk to you again, simply say no and move along. 

Mostly, just keep your SO close by and don't let this cause you stress. Take care of yourself OP."

247,"Yea but we're afraid that he might kill himself if we tell his mom. She already said that she's going to take him to family counseling when he gets back (who knows maybe he's doing something to his other siblings back home). And yes he was molested, when he was about 5 or 6 his 10 year old step brother touched him on his privates and who knows what else. His mom said that after that, he was obsessed with his penis and wanting his penis to feel good. But he remained close to the step brother, although the two haven't seen each other in about 5 years (the step brother is now 17 and in juvenile hall). Do you think that's why he's like this, or could his step father or someone else be possibly molesting him back home? Looking back, I don't like how my family handled him being molested in the past. Although they weren't allowed to be alone together, they did still play and interact together. It's kind of reminiscent of what we're doing now, we're letting him and his sister interact just not alone. I think my family just doesn't know what to do in situations like this, I mean who would you know? You think that you'd act one way until it actually happens in your family and then your just lost and sickened and don't know how to confront it"

253,"The major problem here is that you're headed for a breakup. You can't sustain this. You're already very resentful of your boyfriends manipulation and controlling tactics. The resentment is not going to magically disappear, and your boyfriend is not going to magically change. 

Normally I would say you have to have an honest talk with him. It sounds like you've already done that. And he has attempted to throw it back on you every time, or deny there's a problem. He has even engaged in what's called loan-sharking, where he buys you gifts you don't want, and then leverages them later in order to get you to buy things for him. That's not him being kind, that is a manipulation tactic. Your boyfriend is using tactics against you.

If you want this relationship to work, you have no choice but to set hard boundaries and stick to them. You have already tried just doing things his way, and you're unhappy. You have tried talking to him about your concerns, and he does not care. Since this can't continue indefinitely, your ONLY option going forward is hard boundaries. 

He will resist them every step of the way. He wants the girlfriend who pays for concert tickets and all of his beers. He wants the girlfriend that goes out with his friends without complaining. He wants the girlfriend that pays for his friends groceries. He had a pretty sweet deal going, and he's not going to give it up. He's going to fight you every step of the way. He's going to be angry, and Sullen, and upset, he's going to blame you, and make you feel guilty, and obligated. Look, if someone was giving you free money every week, and then suddenly stopped giving it, wouldn't you try to get it back? Of course. Your boyfriend will do the same thing. You just have to stand firm. Your relationship depends on it. If you give in, you will burn with resentment, and the relationship will fail.

So from now on, no more concerts that you don't want to go to. If he already bought the ticket without consulting you, that's on him. Just explain friendly but clearly that you don't want to go, that he didn't consult you, and you're not going. Make other plans for the night, and stick to them. He will be pissy, he will throw a tantrum, he might cry, he might call you names. Stand firm. It is not your problem.

Make plans for yourself several nights a week. Don't go out with his friends. Go to the library, go out with your own friends, go see a movie by yourself, or just make plans to read a book in your bedroom that night. Tell your boyfriend you have plans and you're not going out. If he pouts and says fine he won't go out either, that is 100% his choice. He doesn't get to be mad at you about it. Stay calm, use the gray rock technique, and don't give in to his tantrum. Stick firm with your plans.

If he invites his friends over, you can either go out for the night yourself, or just go in the bedroom. You don't have to hang out with them. And you absolutely don't have to buy food for them.

273,"Not necessarily. My father got away with not paying child support from the time I was 4. He owed in excess of $50k just on monthly payments (his support order was ridiculously small -- something like, $100/mo). It was NEVER enforced because we were never on state support."
274,"I would say dementia is a reasonable excuse for sexually harassing someone (bc people with dementia have no clue what they're doing most of the time) but it doesn't mean you have to TOLERATE that harassment. It means either someone needs to be babysitting him or he needs to be in some kind of care. It can be a reason for why he's doing this behavior but a lot of people equate that with ""...and since he can't help it you shouldn't get mad or expect anything to change!"" That's the real bullshit part. Something needs to be done to stop it whether he knows what he's doing or not. I don't get mad at a puppy that bites me too hard but I also don't think someone should just get bitten and bitten while everyone around them goes ""oh puppies just do that they can't help it!"" 

Of course this all assumes dementia is even this guy's problem, he could just be a shitty pervert."

286,"Yes but I don't think it will just be eventually. It'll probably go very bad for OP the minute he has this discussion with this girl about ""boundaries"" that so many are recommending. All this alone time with this girl, a wife that thinks he's the one making up stories about her coming on to him and of course no telling how stable this girl is given her troubled background.

Your ""nobody else will love you, feel obligated to stay with the guy who has only tried once in the past 8 years, and only because you're about to leave him"" is extremely fucked up, and shows a pretty low opinion of men in general, if you really think this is the best out there. (And your ""pick up a nice paycheck for getting divorced"" shows your fundamental misunderstanding of divorce and your low opinion of women.)

Even if she is single for a while, that's far better than sticking with a man who doesn't give a shit about her emotional or sexual needs and who only makes any effort in their relationship when he's afraid his bangmaid is about to get wise and leave him, and who she's only staying with out of obligation or the fear of not finding anything better. "
290,"Wow that's a really helpful attitude. OP was providing additional information regarding the care of the animal. 

OP, you need to have a clear conversation with your SO after the trip. If he absolutely cannot leave his dog with anyone other than his mother, you need to establish guidelines for what this means in your future. What if you have an out of state family emergency? Would you have to go without him if he can't get acceptable (to him) animal care? What's the rule moving forward for vacations? How does he now plan to celebrate the engagement with your family? "

Technically, OP can't tell her to not to do that either.

My partner is from a European country -when I visit his friends, those who can speak some English (most of them), try to converse with me a bit, but most of the conversation had by the group is in their own language. I think it's unreasonable for a group of friends to speak in a language some of them don't understand or speak well, just for my sake. I spend much of the night not really listening and still have fun. 

To OP - it sounds like your problems are a bit deeper than any I've experienced. I've accepted that I will spend much of the time not understanding anything, but at least my partner and his friends aren't rude to me. If everyone is lauging and I ask what's so funny, somebody will explain it to me. Maybe you should aim for some kind of middle ground instead of hoping for a whole group to change something as important as language just for one person. It is really important, since not many can convey themselves effectively or passionately in a foreign language. I don't have much to add I was really just curious if u/strangeandweird would also stop hanging out with my partners friends?"

You're going to have a hard time finding someone who is willing to place you that high; your expectations are petty and unrealistic.

Not about gossip. It is about supporting a loved one.

The point is that you *seriously* could have found a ~~&lt;0.9% NaCl~~ solution to this problem. Your issue here is not that your girlfriend does not place you high enough on her list. It is that you are unwilling to compromise or concede any desire of yours for her sake."

301,"This is behavior I might see from teen girls who just discovered feminism and are going overboard. It's a bit odd that a 24 year old is doing this, but it is what it is. 

So, I can explain what she means by her ""You can't be sexist to men"" thing. It stems from the fact that since men have historically been in most positions of power and that things are still a bit skewed in favor of them this means men can oppress women but women can't oppress men(disclaimer - not saying I agree with this, just explaining what the GF thinks). Therefore, in her eyes, sexism doesn't exist against men. 

I know I would not want to be with a guy who tells me ""all girls are terrible"", ""you act too much like a girl"" and degrades me for being a girl in general. Her thinking sexism doesn't exist towards men doesn't excuse her from being a jerk about you and your gender.

Now, I don't know your GF, so I might just be projecting the types of people I've encountered onto her, but in my experience there's nothing really you can do to change their minds. She's going to have to learn on her own that she's going overboard. You should definitely try to talk to her about how she's making you feel - that her telling you that 'all men are terrible' and that you somehow 'act too much like a man', even if in her mind isn't sexist, hurt your feelings. If she doesn't seem to care about the fact that she hurt you(or says something like ""I like you but not when you act like a man"" again), then you should probably end it. You seem to be a mindful person who apologizes when you do something wrong, but you shouldn't have to feel like apologizing for what gender you are :(

DUDE. 

Oh your little sister has you wrapped right around her finger, doesn't she?"
304,"&gt;She also said she felt like how we split cost is unfair to her. She think we should just split utilities based on our income (I make a lot more than her), and split groceries. Since she doesn't own the house she doesn't think she should have to pay anything for that. Part of her feels like she was taken advantage of.

Dude this is bananas. She lives there. Her stuff is there and she eats, poops, showers, and sleeps there. And she is paying no rent at all. Is she your child?

&gt;Her response was that she can't talk about it or I wont propose.

Really, lady?! Damn right you better not propose. She has no interest in being the partner you need. She does not trust you. She can't even be honest with you about her own feelings. 

She's a mooch. She will never be the partner you want. I'm not saying she's a bad person or unlikable or anything. Just look at what you want:  an equal partnership =/= what she wants wants.

You are incompatible. 

I own the house my SO and I live in. He pays me rent and utilities relative to our incomes. It is not too much to ask. I understand that she doesn't want to *feel* like she's your tenant. That's fine. But she's occupying space you could be renting out to someone who WILL be your tenant. She's got to meet you halfway here."

Obviously a pregnancy at her age isn't ideal, but it doesn't have to be this horrible shadow over the entire rest of her life no matter what she decides to do. If she chooses to keep the baby, her life will be very challenging but she can make it. Right now she needs to know that one mistake won't automatically ruin her, and that you're there for her while she makes her decision. "

Like ""Future Mr. Right"", ""Future Babe Magnet"", stuff like that. Still not my style but will make your wife smile.

Edit: You are taking a beating in these comments. And I get why you are. Just keep in mind: You are one month into parenthood. You are going to stretch and bend and grow and love in ways you never knew possible. It is so hard and so amazing.

312,"Right. And I completely agree, that's the issue for me. I do not want to point fingers or act holier than thou, but she is the one that is having a problem with discussing specifics.

317,"Yes, it's a reason to fall out of love. 

You have the opportunity now to realize that love is conditional and that you control 50% of the conditions. If you're only feeding negativity into the relationship, then his positive feelings for you are going to change pretty quickly. 

Be honest about how you feel, of course, but picking pointless fights to work out your anxiety is you deciding to put your need to get negative feelings out onto others above your partner's well-being. Very few people would be able to maintain love for someone who regularly does that to them. 

You can improve yourself for the next guy, so start considering what you can do in the future. How can you work out these destructive feelings without dumping then on a partner's head? Maybe get into fitness, mediation, etc. "
318,"You don't sound harsh at all - this is 100% the correct solution. With a living creature, you HAVE to consider the needs of the animal first. And OP and her bf need to do that RIGHT NOW. The dog must be given to a home where he will be properly provided for."

I could stare at you for hours while slowly licking a hunting knife and while that would not be illegal and I would not be in prison for it it would certainly be creepy.

Low ages of consent are mostly to acknowledge that sometimes teenagers have sex with each other and putting them in jail for it might not be the best idea. it's not some kind of expression that it's open season for adult creeps to go after children sexually. As much as pedophiles like to argue on the internet that that's the case."

Because now she has become more comfortable either with you or with herself. What should you do? Nothing different than you've been doing! Bi people aren't sex demons or threesome machines, they're people. She has the same risk of cheating she's always had; if you were comfortable on that front before you should be comfortable now. She has the same feelings about you, she has the same desire for marriage, she's just as monogamous or polyamorous as she's always been. Why on EARTH would the sex of any potential future partner change anything about HER and about your relationship now? It doesn't! The idea that it does is just demonizing her for her sexuality.

But, you've already said your piece and your manager may keep thinking the same about you. I would start looking for something new. In the future, if you feel you are not getting enough client time or challenging opportunities, then I would say something like: ""I think I can handle more challenging work"" or ""I'd love to become more involved in x project."" No point in burning bridges this early in your career. That said, some people will arbitrarily decide that you're not experienced enough.

Remember the facts here: 

* Super creepy age difference
* Past Emotional affair
* Repeated lying about contacting/not contacting her

&gt; we were drinking and he burst into tears, which really surprised me and is uncharacteristic of him. He started talking about how he misses his friend, and how he feels so alone and that he has nobody to talk to, and how nobody understands him and how he feels so isolated. 

This is his problem. I mean, I know making friends is hard as an adult, but having your only friend being a lot younger with previous romantic involvement is going to end up being an issue in any relationship he gets in. He can go online and make more friends.

He's also basically saying you're not enough of a friend to him to keep him from feeling lonely. **Like she was more emotional support than you.** Is this what you want from a partner?

&gt; What can I do? I want to compromise, I want him to be happy and have a support system of friends. 

He needs to figure out how to have platonic adult relationships. If he needs her friendship but their friendship is causing you to be unhappy in this relationship, you guys are incompatible and you should break it off before there's another emotional affair. If he's holding this over your head, or going behind your back and talking to her again, you should end it. This is not how adults function in relationships. 

Anecdotal story: I had an ex who I was friends with for many years when I started dating my current boyfriend. My friendship with my ex made my boyfriend uncomfortable. We talked about it a few times, and I cut off that friendship with my ex because I valued my relationship more than that friendship. I have other friends, my ex has other friends, we'll survive without each other. If your bf can't survive without that girl's friendship, there's weird dependency issues there that is not a platonic friendship."

361,"Your husband prioritizes the comfort of these friends over you. He did it in the beginning by making sure the ""friendships hadn't changed"" - that sounds like it wasn't a mutual agreement they all made for any current or future marriage changes, but how your husband accommodated them instead of you.

Now that they're married, your husband *still* doesn't want to upset his friends or make them feel the impact of their changes, so **again you're asked and forced to comply with what works for their friendship dynamics - at the cost of you.**

You have to put your foot down with your husband. You either get included with the guys or you don't attend and start fostering your own separate friendships. Don't let them shuffle you to wherever they feel is convenient for them to enjoy their time. You deserve that JUST as much as they do. They don't get to treat women like they are just convenient objects that accommodate their big ol' manly club."

364,"Your parents sound awful. I can't believe the top comments here don't respond to the fact that your dad used to hit you, both parents verbally abused you. For your mental and physical health, you should stay far away from them. Don't go home at all... if you want to see your high school friend, stay with the friend, don't even tell your parents you will be in town, lie and say you're postponing it to another weekend if you have to.

Now as to them being controlling... I think it's great that you're looking into financial aid in case your parents pull their support. Very smart. Keep doing that. But in the meantime, I honestly would not feel remorse for lying to them and taking their tuition money. They were abusive parents and you deserve at least that much from them. Call your parents on the phone and tell them how sorry you are about drugs, that you didn't realize how serious they were about it but of course you will stop 100%. Then stay clean until you have a backup plan for financial aid from your university. In the meantime, procrastinate on sending them any drug tests... weasel out of it any way you can, make excuses, etc. Once you have a backup in place resume your normal lifestyle. Best of luck. "
365,And honestly only weed. Acid and most fun stuff is out of your system within a few days. 
366,"I remember that! I think it was Good Housekeeping, ""Can This Marriage Be Saved?"" They published both sides of the story, had the couple meet with a counselor, and followed up with them. I read soooo many of those in college."
367,If he's actually divorced I'll eat my hat
368,"I get the feeling that this is a troll post for this exact purpose. And if you read the comments, almost all of them are saying he's within his rights to decline to give her rides. "
369,"Apologize to your wife, admit you were wrong and she was right, and ask her for her help. Nothing we can do. "
370,"The fact that several, if not many people noticed his disrespect is very telling of how blatantly obvious he must've been flirting all night. Like it's one thing for you to notice, but when a room full of people notice, you reaaaallly know he was being incredibly blatant and not innocent. "
371,"You're sad because you're grieving the relationship and man you thought he was. Of course you're sad.

Although your sister was the victim in this situation, she has no right to alienate him from his child if you think it would be in the kid's best interest to have a relationship with his father."
372,[deleted]
373,"Please don't give her the letter if you are not going to her coffee shop anymore. That makes you look so weak. Just ask her out. When I saw a letter on my windshield, the first thing came to my mind was stalkers. Then I wondered why he didn't have the courage to ask me face to face. He lost my respect instantly. It reminded me some old TV shows in which students drop love notes into others' lockers and that's in the 80's."
374,"Usually I would agree, but that would require the adult to *admit* that what they did was a mistake and to tell their child how to do it better.

OP's parents *lied* to her about the true nature of their relationship and pretended like nothing questionable happened."
375,I love that sub but there's no indication here that he baby talks because his mom is a JNMIL.  That's a leap.
376,"Not worth it . She want to get back to u because maybe she didn't find anyone to replace you with , But as soon as you guys will fall into the same routine as in the past the relationship will die again . and this time you will be left more broken.
"
377,"Just break up with her.

Best case scenario: she doesn't want to fuck him but cares more about the attention than your feelings. She will continue to flirt with him and you'll hear about it through friends and it'll drive you crazy. 

Worst case: she wants to fuck him and is going to. Either it'll ""just happen"" some night or she'll break up with you to ""find herself and be single"" and you'll find out she  had him balls deep the next night. Or it could already be going on. 

She's not a good girlfriend."
378,"lmao are you serious rn

he's become ""emasculated"" in your eyes? that's your problem, not his. he literally stepped up to defend you and you're whining about him making noises after he'd been punched in the stomach? dude.

it would be one thing for you to say, violence makes me uncomfortable and I don't know what to do after seeing my boyfriend get into a fight. but the fact that your issue isn't with him fighting in the first place but instead with your boyfriend's reaction to pain?

getting punched in the stomach is not only painful as hell but also potentially very dangerous. a hit to the head could easily be fatal. if you think he's not a real man, or whatever, after him defending you, then break up with him and let him find a better woman to date.

don't like feminine men? fine. but don't degrade men for being feminine. that's seriously not okay. "
379,"He's dreaming. Most families cannot get by comfortably on one salary anymore.

The fact that he said you should ""slave away at university"" because you're beautiful is a red flag for me. He wants to keep you where he wants you. Next thing is he'll choose your friends and then get mad at you when you can't tone up or lose the weight after having a baby or two. 


You're 18. You've just started living out in the real world. This man is at a different point in his life than you.
Never ever let someone convince you that your own personal education is a waste of time and or money for any reason. 


I would almost think that this man has some possible abusive tendencies that you're not seeing here. 



What if you don't want children 5 years from now? What if you hate being a SAHM because of how isolating and lonely it is? What if you come to realize that the type of dude that wants his future wife to be a SAHM is usually the same type that won't help with ANYTHING related to housekeeping or child rearing? What if he loses his job and you have no marketable skills to get back into the workforce?


I'm not saying to break up with this guy, but follow the path you want. Absolutely do not mold yourself to fit his image of an ideal woman. You will end up years from now wondering who you are and hate yourself for letting him shape your future for you."
380,"Goddamnit, old people are so fucking cute sometimes."
381,"As a daughter who falls under the same circumstances as yours I can genuinely say you should go alone. If you take your wife or if you don't show up at all you WILL destroy your relationship with your daughter. Also, like everyone else before me had typed this is owning up to a mistake you both made in the past. It is not just your mistake it's your current wife's mistake as well. She should try seeing how both of your actions have affected your daughters life. Also, why should she be the one to make sacrifices on HER wedding day?"
382,As a mid to late twenty something divorced woman with a child my mom got flack in the 80s. Was even asked to not come to a church in Southern California because she was divorced. 
383,"Lol I laughed pretty hard at the alternatively part.

Perhaps I do have a little internalized homophobia I was unaware of but I have a few gay friends and never once have I felt any differently towards them than anybody else. They're still my friends regardless. "
384,your brother and SIL are the ones with problem of their own making....
385,"&gt;At this point I’m ready to tell him to fuck off, but he’s been ~~a great partner~~ very careful to hide who he really is for six years 

FTFY.

Your boyfriend is shit, his parents are shit and his friends are also shit. He's trying to manipulate you into major surgery and weeks of painful recovery because he thinks he's entitled to your ""undamaged"" vagina at the end of it. His selfishness knows no bounds and you are most certainly not being unreasonable.

Tell him you have ""given it some thought"", and you're not going to put yourself through surgery unless your doctor thinks it's necessary at the time of birth. If he loves and respects you, he will accept your decision; if not, then you walk away and bring your child up with the help of people who aren't selfish fuckheads."
386,"I am in the exact same spot. My (30f) husband (29m, together 15, married last 5) is doing the same thing. We haven't been getting along. It's not like an angry yelling but more apathy and ignorance. He tends to be a bit of an arrogant jerk and it's been getting progressively worse through the years. We separated for about 4 months. I let him move back in and now he's helping around the house, being overly attentive....to the point it's almost unnerving.  I want to leave and find someone who actually loves me and wants to spend time with me but I want to stay and try to make it work since he's putting forth some effort. "
387,"I would like for my husband to stay home if it was me... BUT, also: I don't know how far this party is, but if it's near (and if you're good friends with the people throwing the party) then maybe you could swing by for a little while, and ask them if it's okay to take a little food and a slice of cake/dessert home for your wife. Granted, a few people might look down on that, but I had a graduation party once and my cousin got very sick the night before. When my uncle left early to go home and take care of her I sent food, drinks and snacks with him to give her. 

*ETA: If you go I would avoid drinking so you can relieve/help your wife when you come home.*"
388,"Ellen is an abusive and neglectful pet owner. Most domestic cats should weight 10 pounds according to google (though it depends on the cat breed). He's obviously not trained either, and Ellen kept him in horrible conditions. Not to mention that manipulative message about the kill shelter, like that's just fucked up.

Do not give the cat to Ellen ever. I'm guessing that the white cat never ran away, if you get what I mean. Either look into how to train this cat and get it on a diet, or take it to a no-kill shelter so it can find a forever home. Drop Ellen as a friend while you're at it."
389,"You were raped. She didn't believe you, then she blamed you for it. THEN she implied that you *enjoyed* it. You're engaged to a rape apologist and a victim blamer. 

You need to leave. If she can't support you through a traumatic event, how can she be expected to be a loving, caring wife?

I'm so sorry this happened to you. You deserve better. Please leave her. "
390,"you should definitely report samantha. this isn't something small, you were raped, and I'm sorry that your fiancé doesn't seem to be very worried about how you're coping with it. if you don't report her she might do it again. save yourself, your relationship, and other men, report her. "
391,"I'm not saying I see much to salvage either. But as long as the relationship exists, he's being disrespectful and damaging it by entertaining this indulgence with a problematic ex.

He needs to make up his mind once and for all. "
392,"You paint a compelling picture of a woman in a great relationship which she is busily sabotaging.  The textbook answer would be for you to seek therapy.  (You drop some very clear hints about your body image and self esteem.)

However...it's a bit *too* perfect of a picture, and a lot doesn't really add up.  He was in a happy relationship with a great, super attractive woman, everything is perfect, and he just...randomly cheats.  But only once!  And she just happens to find out, and then they have a totally perfect divorce and went totally no contact.  And then he spent 5 years celibate and in therapy fixing himself, and then he met you, and now everything is perfect?

I mean...okay, I guess that's a thing that could happen.  In theory.  But it doesn't really sound very likely, and I think on some level that may be causing you to question the situation.  Because it would be pretty weird if everything he said was exactly true just like he said it, but if it isn't, why is he lying?  Just how closely did you read the court records about the divorce?

Normally divorces are less clean, and you get to hear different sides of the story over time from friends, family, mutual acquaintances, etc.  Plus, if you meet a person you quickly find out they're human, with warts just like all of us.  Here it seems like you're only hearing his side.  Maybe you should reach out to his cousin's wife's friend or whatever...

(And you really should consider talking to a therapist about whatever is driving your focus on your weight versus his ex's weight.)"
393,"Personally, I would let him know that you (plural) will not continue a friendship with him until he leaves Crazy but make it absolutely clear that you will accept him 100% after he leaves her. She's an abuser - she's running off his entire support system and she will have complete emotional control over him. He'll be isolated and without emotional resources to defend himself. Make sure he knows you'll be there when he makes the move to divorce her. "
394,"I think what OP means that if nomoreraddishcalves really does have BDD then surgery to change body features will not change how they feel about themselves and their body. They'll still be unhappy with the result. It's a real mental disorder, it can't be helped. "

397,My slumber parties would be so much better with swords tho..
398,"Just in case the post gets deleted (which I suspect, with the incomplete story and the lack of response from the OP):

&gt;Three years ago, I left to work in the military and it was a very sad moment for my girlfriend and I. She promised that she would wait for me and that we would get married as soon as I returned. Being out there was the hardest I ever had to do in my life and I was told to go back home as I deserved it for my services.

&gt;I was ready to go home and once I got back, I was greeted by my parents, my grandparents and the rest of my family. However, my girlfriend was not there and I was told by my sister that she hooked up with her best friend from college while I was away and that she moved on. I was heartbroken, but I took in the fact that stuff like this happens.

&gt;I didn't even though that she was interested in women, but their relationship is known by a lot of the people I know and it's a very passionate relationship that began a mere month after I left mainly because she was missing our love and affection and she found some from her best friend. She kept it quiet from some people, but lately became very open about it, her best friend is bisexual and now I guess my girlfriend is too.

&gt;I am so heartbroken and angry at her for cheating on me, but I guess she is in a better relationship now. I have spoken to her and she has invited me over for dinner and she still has feelings for me and wants to see me again to catch up, but I just so annoyed at her and heartbroken.

&gt;I seriously don't know what to do now, I feel that I failed her by putting the military first before her and I regret everything! Any advice?

&gt;tl;dr: I [29M] returned from three years of military service last week only to find out that my girlfriend [27F] has been cheating on me with her best friend from college [27F]!"
399,The truth hurts man. u/thirteenth_hour has given you better advice than any other comment in this thread. If you really want to fix things I would pay attention to it.
400,"I don't get this nonsense about people's dying wishes when they involve other people. I remember reading some Reddit comment about someone going to med school because it was his dad's dying wish, and he was miserable. You don't suddenly get to mess up other people's lives just because you're not going to around to see the aftermath of your meddling. Tell him that while he means well, you can't honour his wishes because it will undermine your marriage."
401,"You're not wrong, but my concern is also that OP will trash his relationship with Carol by complying with Sam's request, and then look back with regret on that as well. That's a long history to throw away, and honestly, I think it's kind of awful of Sam to even ask OP to risk that.  It's basically saying that Sam's fantasy of OP and Rachel are more important than OP's *actual* relationship. I know he's dying and people don't think clearly or nicely when that happens so I don't mean to demonize him as a person, just to say that the request isn't okay.

OP, I feel for you because I know it can't be easy to untangle what Sam wants from what you wants from what Carol wants.... I don't know if Carol is the right person to stay with, but I think you should play fair with her. Like u/dahlialia said, work on repairing the relationship or get out on your own terms, not because Sam/Rachel goaded you in a certain direction."
402,"Break up, you aren't anywhere close to compatible."
403,"&gt; How secure do you feel that your wife of many years will be by your side?

Just to be fair to both OP and his gf...they are 20 and 19 years old respectively. It's a little unrealistic to expect any dating relationship at that age to act in any way similar to a committed marriage. "
404,"On the bright side, OP no longer has... to pay for her ticket home.  Money saved, yay!"
405,"""How she is"" = a brat."
406,[deleted]
407,"Throw in some ""my tight cunt"" for good measure."
408,Pastrami method is gold.
409,"This is the attitude of a kind and trusting person, who believes others are the same, and who is about to get fucked in both ears by a reality check.

""We don't want to get lawyers involved"" - if you were capable of making decisions as a ""we"" then you would be be splitting up.

Don't be taken advantage of because you're nice"
410,"I kind of feel bad in a way. Porn culture really dooms a lot of people to be bad at sex. On top of just teaching them nothing, it also gives many men the idea that they have to be the one to know everything about sex, and teaches women to be really meek about it. 

Generally, women won't speak up against bad sex, and men won't take advice from women about it bc ego issues. It's a sad cycle where no one gets sum gud fuk :'("
411,"So he turns a promise ring into the engagement ring and comments that any wedding band to go with it can't be ""too expensive.""  And when you make a joke he goes crazy and throws the ring you love away?  I expect he felt like you slapped him in the face with the comment about the band not costing more than the ring he bought his ex. But the question is what to do now? The ring you love is gone, the concern about his commitment and respect for you remain.  Please put the engagement and the the house purchase on hold until you and he have some premarital counseling.  There are some hurt feelings on both sides that need to be addressed, as well as his spiteful temper tantrum."
412,"""...touch theirs. Maintain eye contact..."" DYING... "
413,I wish I had any advice for you. What he did was terrible and very immature. Something I may expect from a  teenager. Are you sure in your heart this is someone you want to spend your life with. Think long and don't settle. You're better than that
414,This is a massive indication that your relationship is not actually mature at all. No compromise doesn't work in the long run. The only way for her to grow is to move on. 
415,"Your dad is an asshole. I'm sorry. 

I'd tell him that you're not going to put up with him speaking to you like that, that you're a human being, everyone makes mistakes, and his methods of ""advice"" are not only not helping, they're cruel. He'll flip it on you and talk about how mean you are,  etc., but stick to it. When he tries to yell, leave. Leave the room. Or the house. Whatever it takes. Disengage. 

Good luck!"
416,"Not just his mother. OP, this sounds like an emotionally abusive relationship. I'm sorry there are people on this thread telling you to ""man up"" and ""deal with it."" 

You are correct that your wife's behavior is unacceptable. It sounds like she is trying to gaslight you with the whole period thing. She is also isolating you from your family. If you want to salvage this relationship, seek couples counseling. But no matter what, don't give in to her, do not go on this trip. Good luck. "
417,"I agree that it's still an overreaction - hugely so! But if you're going to overreact, this is less creepy than breaking in. It's less of an invasion of privacy."
418,"What the heck? No, OP, this is bad advice. Snapchat is absolutely *not* for anonymous nudes. It is a tool that cheaters *can* use for cheating but it is not an app that is used exclusively for it. This isn't like your BF having Tinder still downloaded on his phone - it's more like claiming that partners who own cell phones are cheating because they can receive nudes through the text messages. "
419,"Maybe she doesn't want you to be inebriated every night. Do you have a plan for getting to the hospital in the middle of the night if an emergency arises? Would you be okay to drive if your wife couldn't?

She may also just find you annoying when you're stoned. My soon to be husband and I both smoke frequently, and when I took a break I found my stoned bf to be really obnoxious (of course, he's great fun when we're both in that state of mind). "
420,agreed. I have 3 different friends that got married within the same time frame.  Nobody else has any issues.  Every situation is different. 
421,"You heard a snippet of a conversation. Definitely not a flattering one, but an older stressed bride venting to a friend is a long way from plotting to keep a new stepdaughter from attending her father's wedding. 

If this was anything more substantial than that, obviously your father would have to find out. I'm assuming he has enough of a backbone not to allow his own daughter to be excluded from his wedding. "
422,This is the best advice OP. Please listen to this person!
423,"First of all, if your husband would truly ""do everything he could to make your life hell"" if you left him, then you need to leave him. That's not a good person to share a home with.

Secondly, you can't predict how his family will respond and you can't control it. They will be disappointed to see you leave him, especially if it's a tradition that they don't support. They might be mad too. But they're clearly attached to you and the children and can see the reality of your relationship and your husband. They might be more understanding that you think. There's just no telling.

So you just kind of have to bite the bullet. You should leave him because he's bad for you. You should be open with his family because you care about them. You should invite them into your life and that of your childrens' because that's something you want. And then you'll see where the chips fall.

You'll be okay."
424,"You report a crime (I.E. breaking and entering, destruction of property) to the police, who file that report, so that the court may work out the rest (I.E. restitution). The police are the first step in that process.

This is also a good step to take should he escalate and she need a protective order, and flags him for others."
425,"OP, I'm so sorry that this happened to you, and I'm so glad you have supportive parents who believed you and want to help you get better. As long as you're willing to try to open up to people who can help you, I bet that you will go on to put the experience behind you and live a long health life, as /u/tedrupi suggests! However:

&gt; Maybe your therapist wasn't suggesting that you were a freak but rather a mature individual with logical thought proccesses.

I agree that this might well have been what the therapist meant, but OP, that doesn't mean you have to keep seeing this therapist.

I think if this therapist makes you uncomfortable you should absolutely tell your parents that and that you'd like to switch. There's no shame in that and you have no obligation to ""click"" with a particular therapist.

"
426,"Nah, sounds to me like she was trying to rewrite her past. She thought if she could get validation from you then she could cope better with your terrible treatment of her in the past. That's not you're responsibility but don't delude yourself with the idea that you are a good person."
427,[removed]
428,Yeah. I kind of think he was using a mental loophole and kind of knew it wasn't really on the up and up.
429,Since when do you need to get hungover drunk to have fun with your friends at a holiday party? If you think that's necessary I think that speaks to bigger problems than who will stay home
430,"You sound judgmental as all hell. Why are you even with this guy if you have no respect for him and just want to change every single thing about him?

&gt;i do accept him!!

Oh, but you just act like you don't?"
431,Who cares how you handled it and when you told him? It still happened and his friend grabbed your ass and your BF took his side? Not cool.
432,"Immature, confusing and annoying. Why even bother with someone like that. "
433,[removed]
434,"I'm not sure I agree with these statements. As someone who has also comes from a messed up childhood and has abandonment issues, that would honestly make me feel a million times worse. And while I've never done the things he's doing, I can admit when I first began dating, there were times I wanted to so I can sympathize a bit. However, if you're 27 then I'm assuming he's close in age and it's time to stop blaming your upbringing and take responsibility for your own healing. You DO need to be assertive about your decision, I just don't agree with saying ""...you're emotionally unstable and I'm sorry you had a bad childhood."" I would leave it at, ""I've felt like we weren't compatible for about a month now but I wanted to give it a fair shot but this relationship just isn't working for me."" If he asks why, and I'm sure he will, you can say, ""I'm the type of person who needs more space and that takes her time in a new relationship."" He will probably bring up his childhood as a reason and at that point, you can say, ""I'm sorry you had to go through that. I can't imagine what it would be like but if you feel it's affecting your relationships, perhaps talking to someone would help. You're a good person and I'm sure you'll find someone who is compatible. I wish it could have been me but I'm sorry to say it is not."" 

Notice how in most of my advice in why it's not working begins with ""I"". The last thing you want to do, especially if you're worried about his reaction is to point fingers, whether it's true or not. "
435,"There are two separate issues here. The first is that your mom is something of a helicopter parent, which will be easier to deal with as you get older. You're almost 18, so moving out/going to college might be on the horizon for you, and you can use that time living away from home to set healthy boundaries with your mom. It will take some work on your part but if you search through this sub there is no shortage of advice on how to do that. 

The second is that either you or your mother or both of you have a wildly irresponsible attitude towards prescription drugs and your various needs for them. Go to the doctor TOGETHER and get what you need prescribed. Tell them the last stuff you had caused an allergic reaction. I don't know if this 'I don't need drugs to manage my schizophrenia' thing is coming from you or her, but you need to educate yourself on the realities of living with illnesses and conditions that REQUIRE treatment. "
436,"I think OP is handling it badly because she has never been taught otherwise. That's no excuse for not taking the initiative to educate herself, but I also think she's unaware of that as an option. There's a kind of learned helplessness going on here that is actually scary. "
437,"Oh, we found a live one here. You can be an intellectual and still occasionally play Neopets after dinner. "
438,"Thank you for the kind words. It's so hard to make myself realise I truly don't deserve this. I am just so unsure when and if I am manipulative and what I can do to change. Like I am a hard believer in it taking two people to make a relationship go south. We have good times but the way he treats me when he's ""not in the mood"" for my mental breakdowns isn't okay. He usually leaves the room or something and goes to chat with his friends on Discord or something. It makes me feel abandoned. I don't think he's a bad person. He's just immature when I've been through some shit that's made me more mature for my age maybe while he's from a very well off family that's handed him everything in a nice little hand basket, a phone, a computer, this birthday he's getting a car. Mommy still pays his phone bill. I think I will ask him to come with me to the local trauma centre once they know me a bit better and have a professional with authority tell him what's up in a way he understands. And if at that point it doesn't get through to him, I'll look for ways to end it. "
439,"2 months is a lot. Not impossibly late, but f*ing unlikely.

Assuming she IS pregnant - what are your thoughts about telling her parents and yours? Obviously it will be a shit-storm, but will they permit/assist an abortion? Will they pack you off to some horriffic Jesus camp/military school? Basically CAN you talk to them? Even if one set is bad, both of you can talk to the other set.

You have to accept this: If she is pregnant, this is too big for two 15 year old kids to handle alone. You acted like kids (condoms EVERY TIME, EVERY TIME!!!! EVERY TIME!!!!!) and you made a childish mistake. You are going to HAVE to stop playing at being adults and get adult help.

I wish you good luck. Fingers crossed that it's nothing."
440,"No, I agree with Mojojojo and disagree with your response. By doing the chores he is demonstrating on a daily basis that he is willing to do housework. While it may be possible he is an irredeemable chore fucker-upper, communicating by cutting off all affection and a refusal to engage in an earnest plea for communication is not the way to go-- and that is what the wife did. I agree that the right step is acting on her concerns, but OP is demonstrating the frustration of someone who doesn't actually know what he's doing wrong. I mean, he's willing to chart this shit out, and she is not offering concrete suggestions. You're being ridiculously uncharitable to him."
441,"She is going to CRY HER FACE OFF!!! Fucking grade A boyfriending, my man. Be proud."
442,"I'd hate to see what OP would say *was* inappropriate, if not all of this. FFS."
443,You should definitely urge her to seek help. She's clearly having some sort of breakdown. You have kids. Don't subject them to a mentally ill mother and a father who does nothing. 
444,"Damage to him? That isn't OPs concern. If he has emotional breakdowns with her, he's probably gonna have one when she leaves him and it is not her concern. He's 37, he should have gotten over his bad history a while ago with the help of a therapist.

OP: do not give this guy a chance, leave now and get yourself somewhere that you feel safe. "
445,"You'd be fine with your girlfriend ""sensually touching"" another dude? No? Then she's cheating. "
446,"Eek. This is a mess. On one hand, it's not good at all for a physician who lost their license due to a drug habit (this is not the easiest thing to do, many boards will give second and third chances after rehab and such for this kind of thing, it happens more often than you might think) and whom you know dislikes you to be trying to send an unknown medication through you. I would be extremely uncomfortable with that. On the other hand, NY State does have extremely good coverage for people with HIV. People have been known to move there to get the benefits. 

If it were me, I would either reject the package (have the deliverer return to sender, wrong address) or get on the phone with them and find out the whole story to your satisfaction and what's at stake. "
447,"When you say he has different morals, what does that mean? "
448,"You might have said you were looking for friends, but unfortunately you did it on a dating app and a lot of people really disregard that. 

He's not going to stop looking at you like a potential partner, and if you keep on looking for friends on a dating app this **will** happen again. 

There are site for just making friends. I'd suggest you stick to those. "
449,"You don't feel the same way he does, that much is clear. He desperately wants you to, but you don't. 
You should create distance. This letting him cuddle and kiss you thing is only going to end up hurting him. 
Thank about it for a few days if you are feeling unsure. Heck, if you are up for it, try kissing him. "
450,"While it may not technically be your house in that it's a house he purchased, it's still your home as you've both reached a point where you're ready to live together. Which is great, *however* this is when you and he start to really see each other in a different way as opposed to when you weren't living together. 

It's a huge learning curve and a big adjustment for you both. It doesn't matter what type of furniture or decorations he's got, the point is that now that you're living together, you need to find a way to come together and make it a home that you're both happy with. This means compromise, which is a good thing!

I know everyone is different, for example I'm a huge Funko Pop collector. My collection could quite easily fill a room on its own. And when I lived with my partner, I toned it down because it wasn't her thing. No way would I expect or even think of having my collection consume that much shared space! And she had her own interests and collectables. Can't say I liked her style either but it was a part of her, so we just compromised. 

To me, it's just a matter of a good talk between you both, sharing thoughts and not getting worked up, which I know is easy to do. Share with your BF that you'd like it to be a home for both of you, maybe you could have some of your things up on the walls, etc. It's only been three months of living together and personally I think it can take a while to both get on a similar page, just gotta be patient and communicate openly which it sounds like you've already got in your relationship. 

The housework, well, that's a bit trickier. Everyone is different, was raised different, etc. Can only draw on my own experiences again, my partner very much didn't believe she ought to do much around the house initially because she worked more than I did. It did become a major issue between us that resulted in one of our first major arguments. Suffice to say I didn't handle it well! I'm OCD about cleaning and I didn't even realise how aggressive I could be about it. That took *a lot* of talking! We eventually found a system that worked; we did our own chores and agreed on what to share. 

Sorry for the length. Just remember that you're both still adapting and it's possible he just isn't used to the whole side of that. Keep communicating with him, because ultimately I feel that you can both find a way to work together on this. "
451,Give him the benefit of the doubt and say.... if you don't start helping out I have to move out 
452,"Yes sorry I forgot to include that! So I don't pay anything towards the actual house (I view it as his house aka his equity so I'm not contributing to that). I do pay all utilities, groceries, household items, and toiletries. It comes out to where he pays about 60% and I pay about 40%. So not quite equal but those proportions are also equal to our income so we agreed it was a pretty fair split.

He really is caring but this past month or two I've felt really like my feelings don't matter at all and it's super frustrating. I think that's a good idea where I'll stop doing his laundry and maybe he'll see that I'm serious about it!

I think I will have to move out if he doesn't change soon..."
453,"First, you need to acknowledge that she's done absolutely nothing wrong or ""slutty"" by having such a past.  People can have sex with whoever they want and can have as many partners as they want.  So long as you acknowledge this truth, we can move forward.

I'm more understanding when guys bring up these types of posts because we've only in the last couple decades have started to come around to the idea that women can enjoy sex with many different partners, just like men can.  Men (and women)  have had it ingrained in them from an early age that women shouldn't be as promiscuous as men, so it will take some time where this mindset is  completely archaic.

So given that, let me try to put this in a perspective that could possibly make you be ok with her past. Not saying it will work but worth a shot.

Let's assume she had 15 partners in 15 months, but since only two boyfriends, most of these guys were one-offs. So in 15 months, she only had sex about 15-25 times.  Safe assumption.

I assume you'd be ok if before you, she had one long term boyfriend, right? Well, she probably had sex waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than 15-25 times in that period.  And probably much freakier sex than with those one-time hook ups.

I don't know if that helps. But logically, it should a bit.

If it were me, I'd be stoked that a girl who hooked up with a bunch of guys chose me to be the one to stay with.  

"
454,"yeah.. I overlooked the petty part, he said he was petty himself. in the beginning I thought it was kind of funny but now that I look at it, its really hurtful. probably not worth trying to talk to him and expecting him to realize where he's wrong right?
"
455,"This was my thought too. Also this stood out to me:

&gt;  I got pretty sick a few days ago (can't breathe through nose, sore throat, much nastier cough than the usual cold, etc) 

Sore throat, cough and stuffy nose are just symptoms of a cold, the 'much nastier' part sounds like it's being played up for effect. Also he said he got sick a few days ago, which is usually enough time to get over the bad part of a cold. 

It sounds like this guy didn't want to go and the cold is a convenient excuse. Even if it's the right decision to make, I'm sure she can pick up on his relief to not be going."
456,[removed]
457,"So, it sounds like you are feeling really personally attacked by your girlfriend's generalizations. You have a couple options to address this: I-statements are always useful, and it could help your cause to look up why people who use phrases like 'all men' or 'all white people' or whatever justify using those phrases. You might not agree, of course, but it might help you get more insight into why she's doing it. That is just a suggestion, I don't mean to imply that the onus is necessarily on you. In a mature relationship, any time one partner tells the other that they are being hurt by the other's speech/actions, that should be accepted and effort should be made to change. If she can't understand or empathize with you being hurt, then you should reconsider the relationship.

It sounds like she's really frustrated too. Being hit on at work fucking sucks. Being disrespected fucking sucks. A lot of times, frankly, being a woman in a sexist society fucking sucks. But frustration, while valid, shouldn't be an excuse to act out against your partner- you recognize this when you say it was wrong to tell her to break up with you (not abusive, necessarily, just not great communication) and she shouldn't have gone off on you for interrupting to point out something she asked you in the past to point out. These are fixable problems, but they involve a lot of work to change communication patterns. It's not easy work.

You should definitely tell her that you feel like she's implying that you are inherently evil because of your gender. Many feminists don't feel that way, but I'm sure some do, and if she's in the latter category then this relationship isn't a healthy place for you."
458,"I'm willing to bet that if he did everything around the house perfectly then it wouldn't make the slightest difference. 

If anything she'd be even more mad as then she wouldn't be able to blame her disdain for him on anything but the real issues. 

I've been in his situation. It is not about the housework; she just doesn't feel it anymore."
459,"Part of me definitely does want to not get trapped in a sexless marriage, but on the other hand she really is so great besides our sex life, and things have gotten pretty serious. We've gone to family weddings together, family vacations, talked about a future including marriage and kids. I really don't want to hurt her by making her feel inadequate, and I also don't want her to think I'm shallow by throwing away a girl I love just because if sex.
But a life time is a really long time to go with such little and so unadventurous sex.

EDIT: Just trying to play devil's advocate. I do very much appreciate your advice, and I do agree that I might be too young to not let myself be with someone that satisfies me sexually, and I'm sure with time I'll find a girl I love just as much, but damn. I really don't want to let go of her if I don't have to."
460,I really hate women like that.  They want the emotional support of a relationship and just cling to that until they find someone else willing to take them and its basically one long affair conga line.
461,"OP, your mother is a bit protective - but 2 Benadryl that had not been authorized by your doctor?  That was not a good idea on your part, not at all.  With the medications you are taking, I would advise you to consult a medical person before taking any OTC remedies. For example:  My  77 year old sister's doctor would only authorize claritin, not benadryl or zertek for her at night because of it possibly making her drowsy and liable to fall if she got up to pee during the night.  2 benadry will knock  my brother in law out so much he walks into walls for 10 or so hours.   So, to answer your question : yes, your mom forcing you to purge was excessive, but you need to check with medical professional before adding certain OTC to your protocols.  They can be dangerous to you."
462,My boyfriend makes more than me and our apartment is $1660 a month. The most I can contribute is $600 a month and he takes care of the rest. Could you guys do something like that?
463,He can pay child support without entering the kids life. Let's be real here. It's the child support obligation he is avoiding. stealing from his own son.
464,"&gt;yes I could leave and go to the library, but why should I when all it takes is disciplining the child a bit?

Because you're a guest in her house."
465,"Sure! I met him while traveling to his country. And we've been visiting each other once per month, so far (We're living at about 1000 miles distance). This is my first ""serious'' relationship."
466,"I would text her tomorrow morning before the beach to let her know that you're not coming because she basically stole $300 from your child and insulted you with the world's shittiest baby shower after getting your hopes up about it.

I wouldn't even ask for the money back, just let her know that she fucked up too bad this time and you'll call her if/when you're ready. Honestly, you do NOT want to be dealing with this shitheel while you have a newborn, anyway. Block her and give it a year, then see if it hurts any less."
467,"^THIS. OP, I'm so sorry that you are having to go through all of this. I wish you the best in your battle against cancer, you've beat it before, you can beat it again. 

Unfortunately sometimes it takes a while for someone's 'true colors' to show, and the above comment is spot on - your illness didn't really cost him anything until now. He's a selfish piece of work and you deserve someone better. I know you care about him but I hope you find the courage to leave his pathetic ass.  "
468,"Same to all of this. If I had to share a room with my girlfriend we'd be LONG broken up, lol. I need my space, dammit, and my SLEEP!"
469,[deleted]
470,They broke up because she cheated. He didn't want to break up but that forced him into leaving her. It apparently took him a long time to get over it.
471,"This isn't a normal thing to do. The people making positive comments are the 10% of the population that are dumb enough to think they're funny. Some of them might be cute, but some are incredibly tacky and the only reason the other 90% don't say anything is because we know that there is no point in even bringing it up. Some people just make embarrassing choices for their children. I feel sorry for you."
472,I would not marry someone if I knew I had to financially support their entitled mother for an unknown number of years because they made poor choices. His girlfriend is being responsible and making sure they can live their lives without the stress of supporting others. Having to get insurance and funding your own retirement is part of being an adult.
473,Yes. 199% yes. Reasonable adults won't touch potential kiddie porn with a 10ft pole and that includes beautiful underage young women on Instagram.
474,"You should reconsider pressing charges.  I mean honestly that would be considered a hate crime.  Also,  if he has no problem beating the shit out of a woman who is a stranger in front of a bunch of witnesses what do you think he's probably going to do to his girlfriend behind closed doors? I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this.  I mean it wasn't a little scuffle,  it sounds like he full on attacked you. 

As for the coworkers,  what others have said about giving them a half truth sounds good.  You were at a party and a stranger attacked you for some reason.  Don't be surprised though if they don't buy it and your boyfriend still gets the side eye. I gave myself a black eye once getting out of a car and my husband got a lot of dirty looks til it healed up. 

Edit: changed shot to shit "
475,"You might instead of unfriending her just set your stuff on a filter so she has to be specifically tagged to see things. However, if she posts something with you in it against your wishes you can report it to FB to have it taken down (just don't tell her you're the one who reported it).

"
476,"Do you use your machine in a separate room? I'd be a little irritated if I was trying to sleep and a masturbation machine was whirring away right next to me. I know Reddit takes the position of ""it's my house and I can masturbate wherever I want!"" but if you have a rec room it's more respectful to just go there and let your gf sleep."
477,Exactly. That incident would've warranted a post of its own.
478,Missionary with the lights off in compete silence would be my guess
479,Yes. Sounds like you got drugged.  So sorry.
480,"So that's fair. You should be able to dress him appropriately for times when it would be problematic for your family relationship. 

The rest of the time? I'd just let it go. The onesie phase won't last forever and people really aren't judging you on the street. "
481,So make sure your the one that dresses him before you go out. You said you feel people are judging you the only people that would are the ones that overthink stupid shit. Most people just go awwww baby. 
482,"&gt; She thinks I'm trying to say I (and my family) are better than her, when it's not the case. 

Well actually it sounds like yes, you and your family ARE better than her and her family. And that's perfectly fine. "
483,"Yes, we're from the UK."
484,"Congratulations on your teenager. 

I'm seeing my old FB posts from the last ten years. A few of my earlier ones are ""I'm excited to clean my house when did I become old"". I did not become ""old"" but rather I take pride in my well kept home. I take pride in being able to cook well. I take pride in being self sufficient. 

Your husband is still an angsty teenager who takes pride in telling the world to suck it. "
485,"&gt; And, frankly, unprofessional for someone in HR.

So much this. They surely can't take her seriously in her role when she acts so inappropriately at work "
486,"Yes but what am I to do?

Isn't this far more on her to do something than it is me? I can only tell her to stop or ask her to switch jobs but it's on her to follow through. "
487,"TBH I am not certain that this guy *wouldn't* end up killing the child. Not through active abuse, but neglect. I can't see this guy taking the kid to the ER in the event of an emergency if OP were unavailable. I'm not sure he'd even notice the child needed to go to the ER, as long as it was being quiet and not bothering him. Kid could be slowly drowning in its own fluids in the crib and he'd never notice.... "
488,"Why do you have to be friends with your sister-in-law? 

It would be nice, for sure, but my brother-in-law and I are cordial around each other, but I was never considered for his groomsmen, nor do we hang out. We're relatives, not buddies. My sister, niece, nephew, wife, and daughters go out and have dinner... he may or may not join. Whatever. He's not the one I care about. 

So, you don't have to be buddies with your sis-in-law, and can almost certainly maintain being close with your bro. Just treat her like you would a co-worker: cordial but superficial."
489,"Download the Venmo app. Send them all the link to your venmo account. Tell them all to venmo you $150 by x date or you'll need to cancel. 

I had a friend take me for a ride on the money for a hotel only one time. Never again. Pay me back beforehand or you aren't included on the booking. Technically until they've paid you back, it's *your* room only. I wouldn't even let them into the hotel room unless they had given me their share."
490,When I read all of the surgeries you have had and all the organs that have had to be removed I winced. I immediately empathized with you as a complete stranger. This is something your husband is lacking. Empathy. It seems all he can see at the moment is how your illness is hurting HIM. Its like he is seeing your recovery time as free time at home. I cant even imagine my husband talking to me like that. Does he usually swear at you when he is angry? Also blocking the room when you are trying to leave is an aggresive move in my opinion. You need to be able to focus on healing without him trying to push work onto you. If he cant understand that then he isnt a very good partner.
491,"Show her this post. If you feel she's just paying lip-service, it means she's deliberately choosing to lie to you about this relationship. 

I'd call that escalation. I'd call that betrayal. What's next? I mean, she's already lying. This has the potential to torpedo your marriage. You need to rehash the discussion until she gets it."
492,"&gt; Get to know her coworker as a person, not just a threat. Have him over for dinner or meet up for drinks with them after work.

I don't really want to get to know him, have him over for dinner or meet up for drinks with him and my wife. If it's all her co-workers then sure but if it's just him it's a hard no. It might not be the most immature response but I'm not the one cozying up with a co-worker  to the point that other people are noticing. 

I can trust my wife but not this situation. Some people seem to think that if you don't trust your spouse in a potentially dangerous situation then you obviously don't trust them at all but that's just not true. "
493,"&gt; J and I flirted a lot more than usual and she very bluntly said she would want to date me if B was ok with it, but only if B was ok with it.

And B is clearly not OK with it.  This means ""no"", OP.  J just doesn't want to hurt your feelings.

Lose this drama and go find another partner."
494,[removed]
495,"No.

They said they would.

The annoying thing is, they went out NYE (we were meant to do it in London for the trip) and they invited me. I said I couldn't go as I had no money because of paying for all these tickets. I would have GLADLY forgotten about everything if they just gave me a fraction of it back, enough to pay for alcohol. Instead, they went out, spent money on a massive meal and didn't pay me anything. Instead, I spent NYE alone. Just a few short weeks before, I thought that NYE was going to be the best NYE of my life :) It ended up being the first one I had ever spent alone.

Then a month later, they were talking about somebody asking them to go to a different country with them and they were going to save up for it. "
496,"If your sister had really thought it was important that you be there, wouldn't she have asked you in advance?

Please for the love of fuck, listen to the ENTIRE internet, because if you don't stop this way of thinking, you're not only not going to marry this girl, you're never going to marry ANYONE."
497,"My job can be time sensitive and occasionally one person needs to send a few emails on my behalf (To which he has told me he doesn't mind). But aside from that, all my work is done on time, nothing gets missed, and I often take whatever time I used off my lunch hour to make up for the loss."
498,You won't be the one ending it.

That doesn't make it better.

500,Actions speak a lot louder than words. His behaviour suggests that he is checking out of the whole relationship. You can't make it work with someone who doesn't want to make it work with you.
501,"Let's assume that you've already cut Ellen out of your life entirely.  She's a toxic piece of shit.  Oh and obviously you have to cut Rob out of your life as well.

That's not your problem right now.  The problem is the unfathomable mess you created by turning a harmless fantasy into a marriage-wrecking paper-trail.  I have to wonder what you were thinking, OP.  But what's done is done.

I would start by showing your husband the first thread you posted before this blew up.  Let him know, to the extent that he will listen, that you love him and that this it was a horrible mistake to commit your harmless daydreaming to a text that make it sound way more concrete than it really was.  Have him imagine what it might sound like if he had to write down one of his sexual fantasies and send it to you in an email.

I think marriage counseling is a given.  Mostly I think this is going to be the only really productive context to share the above - that this was pure sexual fantasy that looks really really bad when you write it down and it gets shared by an ex-friend."
502,"Why can't you explore your sexuality with your husband? 

Just a quick question.  You seem to be a very emotional connecting person.  How would you emotionally feel knowing that your husband slept with a woman he had connected with and happened to be your best friend?  "
503,"""I love my BF but I don't fully trust him""


So why did you move to a new country together? Why move in together at all? 
If you don't trust him then you sure as hell shouldn't be taking steps like this. Work on the trust. If you find yourself unable to move forward then it's time to break up. How long are you going to look over your shoulder and wonder what he's doing? It will drive you crazy. Next you'll try to get access to his texts. Maybe he's cheating? Maybe not. You can't control his actions only your own and you're already being crazy &amp; disrespectful by snooping in his emails. If you can't build trust, you will always look for something to be suspicious. 
"
504,"Yeah it feels like these people being like ""omg OP how horrible for YOU"" aren't considering how it'd feel to know your spouse of 12 years has been fantasizing/crushing on ONE SPECIFIC PERSON FROM YOUR REAL LIFE for that entire time, and doesn't want to stop, and ALSO thinks your actual sex life is meh.

Rob is a fantasy to let OP refuse to bring up the sex life issues to her husband because that'd be effort. Instead she invests in the notion of another man.

This woman is 30 and she just straight up doesn't want her crush to end because it's ""fun"" but it's been 12 freakin years of her thinking about not-her-husband???? Like sure everyone gets crushes but when you're married you SHUT THAT DOWN out of respect to your spouse.

OP do you respect him or is he just convenient for your lifestyle?"
505,I was thinking more about the rest of his behavior. All of the over the top comments about how op will understand such and such after she has kids could be him trying to tell her that she doesn't understand/is not the parent and needs to back off. 
506,"I'd have a hard time being polite to someone who is constantly over analyzing my every move, calling my kid bratty, and plying my kid with sugar and toys. Frankly I probably would have just said, ""Stop buying shit for my kid without clearing it with me.""

507,"Neither of you is in the wrong.  Tyler's being childish about it, but neither of you is wrong.

It's fine to want to be friends with an ex.  

It's normal for your SO to not be okay with that.

It sounds like Tyler had never encountered this situation before, told you to go ahead, and is now realizing that he's not okay with it.  He shouldn't be pouty and passive-aggressive about it, but if he says ""you know, I thought I'd be okay with this but I'm not"", that's a reasonable boundary.

You may have to decide what you want more:  a relationship with Tyler, or a friendship with Nick."
508,"""Tell me things, but don't tell me we're not incompatible, or to break up. Because our relationship is great. Except i'm miserable and we're not sexual. But we want to have kids.""

510,"This is not relevant. She's a 19 year old girl. They are established, well off adults. "
511,"I'm a little confused by these timelines. You said your father was with this new woman for a few months. You said your mother said they had been planning the divorce for a few months. It sounds like their relationship is already done. Do you know whether your father's new relationship started after they had agreed to a divorce? Or after they had already ended it?

The reason I'm asking is because a divorce is just a legal proceeding to dissolve the marriage. Once they've agreed to the divorce, the relationship is done. Calling it an affair if it started after the previous relationship ended seems like a stretch. The timeline of a marriage and a relationship are usually not the same - a relationship usually begins well before a marriage and ends well before a divorce. It would be like saying an affair isn't an affair if the couple is only engaged and not yet married.

While it's not very classy to start a new relationship that quickly, if he did, I could see why he wouldn't tell your mom, knowing it would probably hurt her to move on so quickly. Though in the case of a divorce after a long marriage, at least one of the two parties (many times both in an amicable divorce) usually has been done in their mind long before it got to the point of starting divorce proceedings."
512,"&gt; Also, as this poster's name suggests, you should seek counseling both with and without your son ~~and wife.~~

513,"Plus add in different life goals. He wants to experience living other places, where she's perfectly happy living in Small Town USA forever.

OP also doesn't actually say that they agree about kids, or money. They've only been together for 3 months, it's likely they haven't had those discussions yet. Especially seeing as how money discussions often don't crop up too much until you're living together or considering it..

And seeing as how she comes from the devout, conservative Christian camp, there's a pretty decent chance she expects to be a SAHM in the future, with a bunch of little minis running around to take care of. "

515,"You say your sister and fiancée are decent friends.

That means your sister presumably knew your fiancée was having a serious surgery and had been hospitalized due to an illness.

Yet she still went out, got drunk, then called you for help.

It sounds like your sister does not respect your relationship. It sounds like she thinks she should always be the top priority, and you should drop everything for her.

I would break up with you immediately. Surgery is terrifying and both times I've had to go in, I've woken up from the anesthesia asking for my SO. How terrifying to wake up and the person you love has left to do something they deem more important. Your fiancée is being generous by giving you more chances."
516,"SIL is most certainly trying to be respectful, it doesnt matter what the poor girl does, it's the ""wrong thing"". You're full of conflicting emotions and expectations. If you can, you should reach out to her and start being the best Aunty in the world - only if you can let this unwarranted resentment go though - she does not need that toxicity in her life."
517,"So you have given these adult people a free ride for years and feel like a POS for cutting them off to save yourself? You should definitely go. Gf can come or no, but you're done subsidizing anyone's lifestyle but your own. And if you give gf any money, guess where it's going to go?

Please get some therapy or learn to stand up for yourself. You are a WONDERFUL person for being as generous as you could be. Not a POS for stopping."

519,"If your sister had been attacked or abandoned somewhere that would be one thing. But she was just getting trashed and arguing with her BF and then expected you to bail her out, and you went to her when she didn't _actually_ need you (getting trashed/fighting with a BF and having major surgery are not on the same level) leaving your fiance with her sister. I know it's not how you meant it, but to your fiance it looks like every time your sister calls, even for stupid things and bad behaviour, you will drop absolutely everything for her. It's not fair to expect her to always come in second like you have been doing."
520,"Well, you could gently and subtly encourage her to shower such as by making it part of sexy time / foreplay. You could only go down on her when you know she's recently bathed so she starts to correlate the two. I don't think you should feel pressured to do it if you don't want to.

But, I also encourage you to just tell her. She's an adult and I don't blame you for being grossed out. Hygiene is part of caring for yourself and being considerate of other people. Soften it by telling her how sexy you find her and how much you love your sex life with her but say you just can't enjoy sex when she hasn't recently showered, and ask her to shower more frequently so you can keep up the fun."

Hopefully, she will not have any contact with you and won't confront you. In my experience, if she's at all unhinged, smile, agree, nod, (don't concede that you did say anything you dint remember saying) apologize and be way over concerned and understanding if she does confront you. Good luck, OP. Hopefully, your boss has your back. "

526,"Music, art, pottery, languages, sports, work, video games, drinking, partying, sitcoms, literally anything. The great divider usually (but not necessarily) is if you have young kids or not in the house."
527,"&gt; The unfortunate thing in life is that we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions.

This is so often true. But in the case of OP's boyfriend . . .

&gt;He then proceeded to cook the last three pieces of bacon while I was making pancakes. When we were sitting down to eat I asked for my bacon (expecting one of the pieces on his plate to be for me) and he said he'd forgotten I like to eat bacon and proceeded to start eating like that was the end of it.

He hadn't eaten them yet. It wasn't in any way too late. If he had any intention to share he could have spent 2 seconds passing her a strip of bacon once reminded. He doesn't have good intentions. He is using ""I forgot"" as a way of saying ""I'm not doing that but won't admit it."" He doesn't feel like sharing or generally doing anything nice or putting any effort into OP. That makes him look shitty though (like he is) so instead he lies constantly as a sort of cover for not pulling his weight or ever being considerate. 

If OP really wants to date this guy (for some reason??) I suggest she do the harsh version of what you suggested. When/if he apologizes and says he is a bad boyfriend tell him she agrees and is losing her confidence in and respect for him. When he promises to do something rather then saying she doesn't believe him accept but say very seriously she will hold him to it the next time she sees him. Then when he gets home without your food send his ass back out the door for the food he promised. Or eat the food he bought for himself. If he promises to do a chore tell him to do it now or ask him exactly when he intends to do it. If he whines tell him he is a habitual liar and has no credibility with you. When her argues tell him that if he wanted to keep his word he'd do it when reminded. Never accept anything in trade for a promise of something from later just remind him his word is worthless so you need it up front. And in the bacon situation say ""good thing I reminded you"" and take two of the strips off his plate and eat them in front of his face. 

Or you know, date someone who actually does anything nice for you instead of a selfish lazy lair. 

Disclaimer: This will cause strife and may end your relationship. Your boyfriend is very comfortable lying constantly about being a helpful or considerate partner and doing nothing. He is unlikely to handle being expected to be actually helpful/considerate or honesty about his behavior well. He only calls himself a bad boyfriend to be told he's a good one, as evidenced by the complaints that his lying nothing is not appreciated enough. Even the polite mild way OP handles it now causes arguments but it's not bad enough for his situation and ego (what he seems to care about) to cause any change. Since he dosen't want to change and wants to just feel awesome and lie, you have to make lying and being inconsderate make him feel shitty instead. Also, no matter what you do he is unlikely to suddenly become an honest and helpful man. Maybe just lest bad since you don't put up with his bullshit and make him pay for it. "

She's getting help thankfully to process this.

Has he ever gone to a therapist? I'm not saying that it would be enough for you to stay with him, but I find it rather troubling he hasn't at least done the bare minimum to change himself."
531,"&gt;Please dont tell me to drop him. Thats impossible at this point. Were rooming together and were int he same fraternity. You also cant tell me to ""get over him."" I simply cant.

532,"Congratulations on finding some happiness, OP. 

I don't think you should take it personally. Like you said, this is just them lashing out through their grief. It doesn't have much to do with you. It's not that they'd rather see you miserable for the rest of your life, they just don't know how to process all of this. I'd just ignore them if I were you. Stop bringing him around family for a while, avoid gushing on social media for a bit, just let everything cool down and give them time to accept the idea. Refuse to engage in any negative discussions with them and try as much as you can to let the comments roll off your back."

You can stand up for yourself without invalidating her."

She hates that you are unable to tell the difference between family time, work time, and hobby/personal time.

Eventually, you're going to need to learn how to budget your time in a way that doesn't prioritize selfish wants over responsibilities.

You just said ""we stopped midway through... He said he didn't want to do it ever again. I think he enjoyed it"". No, he didn't enjoy it, he obviously didn't like it because he was hesitant at first, stopped you midway through, and told you to never do it again. But in a nice way.

Were you two sober during this incident? If not it sounds like you coerced him into it and he didn't want to do it at all.

You can be dishonest with yourself. Sometimes the truth is hard to accept."

It's not rude to send a few messages or take a call, I'm sure she will be speaking with friends/family in the same manner and he doesn't need to hold her hand 24/7.

I would suggest saying to him that you'd love the chance to speak and get to know her and ask if he could set up a 3 way Skype call.
His reaction will probably tell you all you need to know. "
563,"I don't think ""keeping it a secret"" and ""explaining it"" are your only two choices here. You could just mention it in a more low key way and just say it doesn't appeal.

I don't think you owe all kinds of reasons and explanations to anyone (unless it is actually someone who is trying to get you to marry them). 

Also, bear in mind that understanding you, agreeing with you, and respecting you are three different things.

The third one is the one that has to always be present in a friendship, but I wouldn't stress too much about the other two. It sounds to me like your current set of friends find your ideas challenging, but as you meet more people and grow and change you'll find more understanding and common ground with people.

EDIT: I've just had a PM telling me that ""not addressing"" the fact you don't want to marry with people you are dating would be ""selfish and duplicitous"", which is a fair point.

So to clarify, in case it wasn't clear,  I'm not suggesting that OP keep it secret from any prospective partner. But she doesn't have to justify and explain in detail her position on her own marital status to everyone, much less get into an argument defending it as she describes above. "

567,"Okay so I had to make an account after reading this and reading your post history. OP, your fiance cheated on you for 7-9 years?! and you're still thinking about marrying him? You're expected to bend to his every whim, but he can't even bother to take off work to help you move out of your own apartment? I'm sorry, but you need to find your spine and leave him. He does not respect you or your time. You'll be thrown under the bus every time when it comes to his family and it'll never end. "

569,"FOR REAL. That is some creepy controlling family behavior that OP needs to address. Forget this girl (keep shutting her down if she persists) but you really gotta address the fact that your family wants to meddle in your life like this. You're an adult, you're independent--you are allowed to draw a hard and fast line here. If they keep bringing her up, you don't talk to them. The first time they do it they get a warning, the second time you hang up (and don't answer callbacks for 24 hours) / you walk out &amp; leave / you kick them out of your house. This is a perfectly reasonable boundary to take seriously. Don't justify, argue, defend, or explain--just tell them you are 100% done talking about Rose, hearing about Rose, or even having her name spoken around you."

He may have also gotten back in 'contact' with an old dealer he owed money to and needed to pull it and stay away from home to keep his family safe.

I've got a brother in my fraternity who was into crack/meth (dealing too) and he refuses to go back to his hometown, period, because he fucked some people over and made some enemies that wouldn't hesitate to drop his family in retaliation if they found out where they lived, even almost a decade later. If OP's bf had a serious problem with crack I wouldn't be surprised if he owes some people some solid amounts of money."
572,"&gt;-He unilaterally made the decision to stop using condoms. He never asked me. He just stopped one day and I didn't know how to approach it. I thought it was just the natural progression of the relationship but with some other things that happened now I'm thinking it's a red flag.

You say, ""We need to discuss our methods of protection. I am committed to practicing safe sex, and I want to make sure we're on the same page."" This is not the natural progression of any relationship -- that's something that should be discussed.

&gt;I work retail and I thought someone might have been messing around in one of my dressing rooms. He told me to record it. I said that was wrong and immoral and he disagreed.

Yeah, it's also illegal. 

Yes, these are all red flags -- including the ones I didn't comment directly on. Pair this with the age difference, and it's clearly a power imbalance issue that's only going to get worse if you continue the relationship. He's showing no respect for you or your body. I wouldn't be surprised if his plan is to get you pregnant and make you feel trapped in this relationship.

I mean seriously. A month and youre debating this?  What kind of country would you be moving to? Not expected to wear a hijab? What if he decided to change his mind later on? What would your thoughts be on that? Do you even believe in the religion, their God, or are you just like ""eh"" because you think you want to be with this guy? How do you feel about having to pray as many times required per day? Just going to go through the act and fake it? Because he sounds devote. Yeah, a lot of religious texts sound great. You ready to worship and really devote yourself? Have you taken any actual classes and learned their beliefs aside from reading by yourself?

Who is going to do the housework? Who is going to manage the money? Joint accounts or separate? Are you guys sexually compatible? What are his friends like? Going to move in together immediately? What's his religion think of that? Premarital sex? What is divorce like? Can YOU even get a visa/citizenship to live there? What is the workforce for women writers like there? Is your writing a match for the industry/is it freelance online? How much has the whole working thing been considered? Do you need to learn a new language?

How much do you even know about this guy after a month of texting/whatever that you want to basically say ""fuck you"" to your brother and everything you've known to move to another country, join a religion, and start anew with him?

I'd apologize that this comes across as rude, but I'm not sorry. This is the near worst idea I've heard. And I've made plenty of dumb ones myself.

585,Sounds like he has two girlfriends that don't know about each other and he tells them both the same thing. 
586,"&gt; I just have mixed emotions because he's had a history of hooking up with his girl friends

I don't follow. Do you mean you'd be afraid of him hitting and quitting, or that he would keep hooking up with his other girlfriends if you started a relationship? If you don't trust him—which is totally fair, I don't know him—turn him down for that, not for who he's hooked up with. If you do trust him, neither of these should be concerns. Either way, ""why won't you let me love you"" does not sound like he's looking for a hookup.

All of which is irrelevant of course, given you should really turn him down becaue you do not like him the way he likes you. Stop doing things that make it look like you do. You didn't know better since you're inexperienced, but now you do."

I still live with my parents, haven't gone to college yet, but I remember one of my sisters marrying a guy who didn't tell anyone what he earned and my family was just stunned. It was considered weird not to be open about that. I talked with him about it (he was giving me advice on colleges and career choices) and he said that no one where he works tells anyone else how much they make. Like, he literally has no idea how much the guy whose office shares a wall with his office makes. And he has no idea how much anyone he works with makes. "

Differing political views may  not exactly be a red flag, but they're going to make this relationship difficult.  Can you talk about politics?

But when there's a large disparity in income, and the higher-income partner wants to enjoy a higher standard of living, it's not really fair to demand the lower-income partner contribute an equal 50%. 

It's really a situational thing for a couple to decide for themselves. As an obsessive lurker in this sub, apparently a lot of couples aren't good at agreeing on how to divide spending!"

Kicking them out *is* an option, but OP feels obligated to put up with this since her father has always been there for her and raised her as a single parent (something that is a responsibility/obligation of any parent either way).

No, a bf shouldn't be like this. Also, if he hasn't told his friends you are back together then it is worrying. why? because if they don't know you are back together then he can act single and do whatever he wants around them.

Is it usually him who breaks up with you when you guys are on and off or mutual?

Look, he may not be cheating, but it doesn''t justify his behaviour. He wants the comfort of you and having a gf yet at the same time he wants to flirt and lust on other girls.

If you can't trust him, leave him. And a guy will come along who will show you how a real bf should act like.

Trust me, at 23 you'll look back and go like 'why did i ever stay in this as long as i did' (i am 23 now and i want to punch myself for what i put up with a the age of 20). Now i have a man who is showing me what it is like to be treated like a queen. We all deserve that."

603,"&gt; The whole point is that the implication is that this man hasn't learnt his lesson from his first child, which isn't necessarily true. If he didn't want to use a condom because he believes that the pill is enough then that is reasonable. 

Right. My entire point is that I *categorically* disagree with you. It's not reasonable to whine about having to use a condom EVER, and he clearly hadn't learned his lesson about accidentally getting someone pregnant - if he had, he wouldn't be fucking whining about using male birth control. He got so butthurt about not being able to force his ex to get an abortion while simultaneously refusing to be responsible NOW. But guaranteed he'd still demand that he got to decide what happened if OP got pregnant, despite his continued irresponsibility.

The proof is that this bumblefuck is *still* whining about the CHILD he helped create. He's 32 years old, he missed the deadline for growing the fuck up and taking responsibility."
604,To be fair though I doubt OP was working all 48 hours that he was away. That aside I'm not disagreeing with you that he needed alone time. It's just that asking for it during a date night that he had planned with his wife who was excited to see him when he came home was the wrong time for it. 
605,"Wow, how magnanimous of him to offer to bring his A game (somewhere fancy) after you've proven to him you're worth it. Who says that? It is one thing to keep it casual on first meeting, but this is weird as hell. Borders on him not wanting to spend too much money until he is sure he can get what he wants out of you. Spoiler, he will likely never take you anywhere ""fancy"".

Your instincts serve you well. This guy is meh at best out of the gate. It's all downhill from there. Don't waste your time with this. There are plenty others out there who will be much more enthusiastic to talk to you.

As you said, OP just *doesn't know* if this event will make the wife turn her life around and stop being so despicable. What OP *does know* is that she back-stabbed her life partner. And the partner deserves to know what sort of a person he calls his wife. "

Meanwhile, I hit the gym every day while he sat on his ass. Your weight is healthy and you should NOT be starving yourself for this guy. I made that mistake, and he treated me like dirt (it started with weight and soon he was criticizing everything about me, constantly pointing out ""flaws"" or things I did ""wrong""). And yes, you ABSOLUTELY can risk losing him if he doesn't respect your health. And if he wants you to work out more but isn't willing to do it himself, maybe you should consider whether YOU are as attracted to him anymore, because that is bogus. 

Also, you can't spot-reduce so him telling you you need to lose weight from your chin and stomach specifically is ridiculous. As others have said, when you lose weight, you lose it where you lose it — you can't dictate where you get thinner faster (I tend to gain/lose in my boobs first, which is a pain in the ass, and nothing I've done has ever changed that)."
610,"&gt; I just feel like I'm wasting time on his giant robot shows and stuff

Is he aware that you consider watching one of 'his' shows with him a ""waste of time""? I bet that would affect how interested he is in doing your hobbies with you.  

I watch Ellen with my wife. I don't like the show. But she likes it and watching it makes her happy, and I love making her happy, so I watch it with her. Pretty easy trade-off. "
611,Why would she cry and beg me to keep quiet if she had an open marriage? 
612,"Funny enough, she said she can't cut my hours and the only thing I can do is resign. So I wrote my resignation that night and brought it in today, lmao. Now she's freaking out"
613,and look! she IS making drama! no wonder she didn't say anything
614,"&gt;his main goal in life is to make sure he doesn't hurt her feelings

yeah, that is SUPER dysfunctional. there are a lot of things more important than her feelings."
615,"&gt; Is it fair of me to tell my boss no, given that I've put in over two weeks notice?

Absolutely. just say ""Sorry, I can't"". Don't be afraid of conflict."
616,"Right? Reading some of these replies feel like I'm taking crazy pills. She's trying to work on the marriage and at best (based on her comments) he seems openly uninterested in her and is instead jerking it to her 21 YEAR OLD sister. I highlight her age due to the maturity gap between the two of them- I sure as fuck don't hang out with 21yos or want to in my 30s. Especially, say, my sister-in-law in the way he's clearly crushing on her."
617,"""Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark..."""
618,"Yeah, it's pretty telling that this young woman apparently cares more about OP's well being than her own husband does. But, OP is in shock and upset, so I'll give her a pass on that floozy comment for now.

But OP, keep in mind that not only did your husband continue an affair through deception to both his affair partner and you for five months, but he only admitted to it after the other woman forced him to. I highly doubt he ever planned to tell you. He elaborately planned and schemed for months to cheat on you, instead of just talking to you. He never once worried about your needs in that time. And even now, instead of caring about you, letting you have space and work out what you want to do, etc., he's selfishly flooding you with calls. He's still thinking only of himself.

He blamed you for his cheating, too! What if you get busy again sometime? What if you have kids and can't have sex for a long time? How can you ever trust him not to cheat? You'll always be wondering. "
619,"I had an older coworker (37) do to me what your husband did to this paralegal (early 20's and first professional job), where he told me his wife had divorced him, had custody of their kids, etc...so I had no clue that I was participating in an affair. Since he had no pictures at work, except of his kids, and was flexible in his schedule after work to see me, I believed his story. He took advantage of my naive nature and inexperience, so when I found out the truth, I tried to help out his wife and give her ammo for a divorce (text messages showing the affair), but she chose to stay with him. No clue why. He lied to both of us and manipulated some sob story to her (she told me everything he said to her and I tried to convince her he was lying). DO NOT stay with this man. He *chose* to cheat on you and prey on a much younger woman that he could easily manipulate."
620,"You know what, I just read all your replies and honestly, you have already made up your mind. Go be the little doormat for the girl who cheats on you. Come back when your asking if you should forgive her the 10th time."
621,"Don't worry, anyone who knows anything knows MD are the harder/superior schools ;)"
622,"After your boyfriend made the comment, you say that Jess ""was banging her head on the wall."" Then faced with the prospect of seeing him again, she said ""she might come, but that it wouldn't be her fault if she runs out of the room crying.""

These are not normal emotional reactions. There are two possible explanations for this kind of behavior:

1. Jess is seriously mentally ill or otherwise incapable of controlling her behavior.

2. Jess is using this comment as a pretext to control and emotionally manipulate you.

Which do you think is more likely? And either way, how important is it to you to maintain a friendship with someone who treats you like this?"
623,"Yeah, it pretty much has.  This is a consequence of the choices you've made, and you can't avoid it with lies and hiding.

If you choose to remain close friends with the women you've slept with, you need to date women who are okay with that.  That's another choice, with consequences.

If you choose to not restrict who you date, you need to be prepared to lose your friendships with women you've slept with.  That's another choice, with consequences.

If you choose to lie to your SO, you need to be prepared to be emotionally invested in the relationship when it blows up due to your lies being discovered... as you've already seen.  This is a third choice, with consequences.

You ... don't get to avoid consequences.  That's not how life works.  "
624,This is correct. Inheritance is not a natural asset. 
625,"&gt;He called and for some reason I got really aggressive, told him take it now or we’re through, I wasn’t going to watch him die of a heart attack and then hung up. 


Were you being honest when you said he had to take it or you'd leave?


If you were lying about that - if this was a manipulation tactic - then I think you overstepped your bounds and what you did was wrong. Understandable, and I empathize, but still wrong.


If you were being 100% honest in saying you'd leave if he didn't quit and take the offer, then I think you are in the clear. In that scenario, you didn't force him to do anything - you presented him with two clear options and allowed him to choose which one he wanted to go with. Your husband is an adult; he could theoretically have chosen to stay at his former job and lose his family (as unlikely as that may be).


So I think a lot hinges on how honest you were with him; I don't believe in lying to manipulate someone into doing something you want them to do, but I *do* believe in being clear and firm about dealbreakers in relationships - only you really know which one this scenario is. "
626,"Wow, you sound like a mess.  Move out and get therapy bro, you should not be in a relationship until you can get your impulses under control.

She thinks you cheated because you did cheat, while she was trying to work through issues from you having been abusive.  Get out of her house and leave her alone.  I'm glad she got the courage to leave."
627,"Since you are working full time you need to pay for your housing costs.  Either rent a place on your own, or pay to live with your mother.  If you find life difficult living with her, then move out and get your own place.  She can downsize if you are gone.  Paying rent or a mortgage is a fact of life.  Having to live in a stressful environment is not.  "
628,"Yes because all women have no idea what proper communication is like, and they're all manipulative. "
629,It has a lot to do with it. It's absurd to agree to marry someone before you even know if you're sexually compatible. All the communication in the world can't change individual preferences or physical capabilities. 
630,"I think she took a job a decade ago and the guy flirted with her and convinced her to sleep with him all summer. Guy now comes forward and makes ambiguous statements possibly implying dad told him to or that dad wanted me to watch over you and I used that to sleep with you.

Either way, I don't understand why tell her now."
631,"Sounds like you guys need help.

She can't keep being vague. She needs to outright say, ""When you put your penis in, I need you to kiss me/grab my boobs/pinch my butt"" whatever the hell will make her feel ""loved"" in that situation. She can't keep humming and hawing and expecting you to read her mind, then getting angry at YOU for magically not knowing what to do, despite no words.

As for you -- you need to stop trying to read her mind. Stop trying to go off these vague cues and then feeling like a failure when you can't manage. That is going to destroy your self esteem and make you hate sex more than she does and build resentment. You can't let her get away with being vague anymore -- she needs to *outright say* what she wants. Either you BOTH learn to speak clearly, or your sex life is going to be shit. That's really it.

There are sex therapists that can possibly help you learn to talk to one another if necessary, but at the end of the day, this is less a sex issue and more an atrocious communication issue. Three years in, she should be comfortable saying, ""Use more lube/Kiss me when you put it in/Rub my clit when you fuck me/Put your finger in my butt when you do my from behind"" or whatever else. You can't sit around guessing, and she can't sit around upset you don't ""get it"". It's poisoning the entire relationship. You have to both sit down and agree to be straightforward, and then practice at genuinely being so. "
632,"Well, after reading this, I honestly don't understand why you would want to be in a typical serious longterm relationship? 
That is not for everyone, that's totally fine. There are plenty of ways towards happiness and content."
633,"Except that OP admits he would disappear for hours at a time with no explanation and was also hiding his phone. It's unclear from the narrative if that happened before she started getting suspicious or after, but if it was before, she's certainly not acting ""based on no reason."""
634,"&gt;am I the only one

 Probably not"
635,"Sounds like you have an narcissistic mother. I highly recommend that you google the article ""enough about you Merrill Markoe."" (We can't link here). It's a funny and informative article that explains how a narcissistic parent works (the fact that she doesn't consider you your own person is a big tip off). 

You might also check out r/raisedbynarcissists. It's a good place to learn that you aren't the crazy one, that she's far more abusive than you realize (it's hard to see when you've been raised in it), and how to deal with her and keep your sanity. "
636,"Yeah, that must be really frustrating for you. 
I know you've tried to talk to him about it... But was it a serious talk or a quick chat? Maybe tell him that that evening you need to have a serious discussion about this issue. Lay down a rule that you must be informed BEFORE plans are finalised and make him stick to it. If he cancels things because you say no, let him. If you give in he realises he can get his way by strong his feet. Call his bluff and stand firm.

If just saying no isn't enough, say you're hanging out with your friends. Or implement a system; every time you hang with his friends, he's got to hang with yours. You've got to plant your boots in the ground and not let anything uproot you. 

His behaviour is controlling, even if he doesn't realise it, and you shouldn't have to put up with it. "
637,"&gt; he doesn't ever do errands for me (if I ask, he rolls his eyes and complains.) 

And you're still engaged to him?"
638,"Yes, it's super easy to just get a job that pays a lot of money with a whopping 6 months of experience. /s

Your boyfriend is an idiot, and you should find a better one. He doesn't respect you. He's incredibly lucky to have found a job so quickly and he seems to think that everyone can do the same thing.

Get rid of him, move to a far more reasonable rent situation and live your life. If you're really doing a great job, you will earn more, either at your current company or the next.

"
639,"That's an interesting take. I usually go more for the ""people show you who they are with their actions, not their words"" philosophy, which in this situation would mean she's not a gold-digger. 

Based on her behavior, I lean towards the theory that she's making jokes because she's aware of the income difference and humor is her way of dealing with the awkwardness."
640,"Why would I tell my daughter about the inheritance I got from my mother?  Why would I do it when she was 10?  Hell, why would I do it now?  Its none of their business.  The fact is you start talking about how much money you have and suddenly its the worlds business.

He's not hiding it, he just didnt tell you about it.  Im sorry that you feel poor right now, but you have zero claim to that money unless he up and dies without a will."
641,"&gt; If he can't put his anger aside, they need to split up.

It's been 2mos..."
642,"&gt; men in America still think it's inappropriate for married/committed partners to have one on one interactions with members of the opposite sex.

644,"That whizzing sound you hear is the bullet going RIGHT over your head.

Here's the thing about ""dreams"".  They're fiction.  Dreams end, and when you wake up, you're in the real world with bills to pay and responsibilities to manage.

To, at 23, *twenty fucking three* act like somehow her dream of travel is dead is absurd, and the height of immaturity, child like thinking.  Yeah, people do have months long travel excursions.  In their *sixties and seventies* when they're retired, have a set fixed income, and no job to go to.  

You didn't do anything to this woman other than say ""I'm not willing to sacrifice my job to go backpacking across Europe for several months"", and to get the *""you ruined my life!""* because you weren't willing to essentially sacrifice everything for a whim is...beyond insane."
645,"&gt; say hide in the trunk and pop out on the road.

What in the world are you even proposing someone would do?"
646,"&gt; Again, maybe I'm naive, but I'm not sure what they could do with that information to hurt me.

From your description your biological parents do not live in the same world of reality that you and I do.  Now that you have a life you enjoy and are relatively well-adjusted, you may not really be able to apprehend just how deeply disturbed some people could be.  

For instance: if I had treated a son of mine the way that you have been treated, as soon as I came to and realized what had happened I would seriously consider ending my own life.  It would not occur to me, for instance, to instead proceed by telling close family lies about you being a drug-abusing whore.

Be aware that your biological parents are capable of great evil and remain capable of it as long as they live; the guilt they bear and repress is something they will never fully work through, and while it seethes beneath the surface of their miserable lives, it will continue to work evil through them.  Repressed guilt of this magnitude is a standard motive for murder, for instance - by killing you, their subconscious says, they would kill the thorn that has been stabbing them all these years.

I would advise you to be skeptical of your sister's motivations and actions too; she is just starting to understand the full picture and it is going to come as a great shock when she really digests it."
647,"She's trying. I'll take that over ""I hate you and you're going to burn in hell."""
648,"This is not romantic, this is creepy. Your gut is warning you - listen to it."
649,"&gt; having tarot cards is really not on the spectrum of offensive or controversial.

Actually for Christians, that's absolutely on the spectrum of offensive or controversial, because tarot cards = fortune telling = occult.  Something evil to be taken seriously.  A devout Christian is going to be put into an extremely uncomfortable position being invited to support the couple as they indulge in a Satanic practice.  And it's not enough to explain any innocent intent, as they believe any occult practice invites Satan around whether the participants believe in the occult or not.  

It's not the family trying to exert control over OP, but their religion exerting control over the family.  A lot might feel like they are commanded not to attend even if they don't participate in tarot cards, just because they believe an evil presence would be there, and because they are Christian they feel like they should know better.

The person who contacted her has been more than gracious.  No one is making demands - OP holds the cards (hur hur).  OP's family still accepts her and her non-Christian wedding, but the presence of an element that directly opposes their religion is a bit much if the element isn't that important to OP in the first place. "
650,That's an awesome sub! Thank you so much.
651,"You may have good points regarding lack of dates, sex etc but you do yourself no favors comparing it to his previous relationships. Do people who live together go on less dates than those that don't? Yeah, probably and that's quite natural. 

Wanna go on more dates? Talk to him about that. Want more sex? Talk to him about that. But bringing up exes will weaken your position as it just ends up sounding like petty jealousies."
652,[deleted]
653,"I dont understand this. Seems very clear you want other women and dont want to marry her. So why are you making it worse and trying to keep her now? Have you told her you dont want to marry her and dont see a future with her? I think you need to tell her that and then let her decide whether she wants to keep your sorry ass. 

You really care? Let her go now because you are holding her back from someone that wont cheat on her and will give her the future she deserves. 

You are being selfish."
654,"I couldn't deliver that line without breaking down crying myself, I am not good at being outright mean. Snarky and sarcastic, yes, but not mean."
655,"Yes, in abusive relationships attachment often gets confused for love. Of course OP is attached, children need to do this to survive, but if this is confused for love then you end up with a really messed up idea of what love is. This isn't it. "
656,"I was cheated on by my boyfriend of 7 years (much less severly than your situation) but I firmly believe there's a difference
between ""cheater"" and a best friend who really fucked up but would never do it again. Your
husband seems more like the former. He didn't seem worried enough to tell the paralegal you'd be at the
party (he should be scared shitless); he resisted the truth even when you had hard evidence; 
he only told you because he got caught. 

Most importantly, his aversion to take resposibility. What he did was flat out wrong, and it seems like he has 
a laundry list of reasons why it wasn't 100% his fault. He should be chiefly concerned about your mental/emotional state,
not clearing his own slate. He might be your best friend, but he doesn't fully respect your welfare (or even the welfare of
the other girl involved)."
657,"Just for the record, I believe you, but my boyfriend said all those things to me, too. That he could never imagine cheating on me. Her behavior doesn't raise any red flags that she's controlling - she is expressing a (perfectly normal) boundary to you. So the question becomes, is this a deal breaker to you? She's uncomfortable with it, it's not weird of her to be uncomfortable with it (as all the comments on this post show), so is your friendship with your ex worth making your girlfriend sad? If so, that's ok, but it means that you guys are incompatible.

Also, for the record, it's not like she's lacking trust in you out of nowhere. You going out with your ex the first time without telling her is a massive trust-breaker. It could have been remedied if from then on you made sure to be *extra* careful around the ex, getting some distance and always keeping your girlfriend updated as soon as ex texted you to make plans. But you didn't do that. I think part of your problem is you're thinking of all of the things you did as isolated incidents, whereas she's seeing them through the lens of having her trust broken and then *her* putting in tons of effort to rebuild it while you don't really make it easier on her."
658,"This is the worst way he can establish trust with you. Trust is formed by him being open and honest, and you learning to react appropriately. What he's doing isn't okay, in my opinion. He doesn't get to shut down communication in response to you overreacting. That's not how you move forward. He is making things worse. I would break up with him."
659,"Ok, but here's the thing -- I want to be your unicorn because * I * don't want to get to know you and chat about your lives. I get off on having an experiences with 2 other people because I'm my OWN person. Do I *have* to get to know you for this to work? What if I like the thrill of some awesome hook up? 

I know you and your wife WANT a deeper connection but I think that is going BEYOND unicorn territory into something even more mythical.

BTW, my scenarios are all hypothetical. I'm a sex worker and find it crazy the nit picking when I would charge upwards to $1000k for that moment in time. This woman is doing it for free and is excited. Damn. "
660,"I know your ex hasn't struggled with boundaries, I was stating that I'd been in a similar boat. 
Also, empathy is a thing. I think it's awful convenient that you seem to think if the shoe were on the other foot, you'd have no issues. Putting yourself in her shoes is supposed to make you understand another side's point of view, not make you more ardent in defending your own.

 That aside, it *should* be enough that your girlfriend needs your help right now. The more you try to deflect and say her feelings are her problems, and not yours to deal with as a couple, the more obvious it is that you don't particularly care about ""Hannah"" as deeply as you do the Ex. If it's JUST lunch once on a blue moon, then why is it even important to begin with? Why would blowing it off or cutting ties with the ex matter if you have absolutely no feelings for her? 

By cutting the ex out of the picture, you help your girlfriend and show her she matters more. It's a solid win across the board. My guess is though, that that is not the case, and you rather like being able to play with fire. "
661,"That sounds mental health related, the cyclical nature of her moods. She should at the very least be evaluated."
662,[deleted]
663,"&gt; she says she thought about it and how to tell me for almost 2 years.

She messed up. It's a basic compatibility question and she put it off too long. I'm sorry.

&gt;I offered a compromise as this made me uncomfortable. I told her she could openly date women but I just couldn't come to terms with another man, for various reasons.

I get the intent, but it sounds like you didn't want to open it up in general, which means it basically ended then. Going along with a poly relationship you don't want to be in is a bad idea.

&gt;   I just keep asking myself why our relationship wasn't enough for her or if I should have gone along with her idea despite the way I was feeling.

It doesn't work that way, and no. You didn't necessarily do anything wrong. 

&gt; 2.) Can anybody ELI5 why someone would end what they call the best thing thats happened to them so they can sleep around?

Some people aren't happy with just one relationship, or don't see the point in limiting themselves. It's more than just 'sleeping around', it can including love. It doesn't make her a bad or shallow person, or your relationship or you bad. It's just an incompatibility.   "
664,"I agree. In fact its REALLY DANGEROUS to recklessly and desperately search for jobs. I made that mistake and ended up doing a lot of things I didn't like and wasted a lot of time where if I just took some time off, experimented, and really figured out which trajectory to go on I could have saved way more time.

667,"I would be extremely wary of letting your mother move close to you and take care of your child. 
Verrrrry wary. 

First of all- if she's taking care of your child she may feel as though she can make decisions about raising that child that you don't agree with. 

2nd- she will be there ALL THE TIME. Do you really want to deal with her all the time? 

3rd- this is the biggest one here- she may emotionally abuse that child. Is that worth it to you? For free daycare? 

Keep your boundaries. Just because she is your mother doesn't mean you have to let her do anything you're not comfortable with. Be careful. She sounds very manipulative and absolutely abusive. 

I would also recommend you talk to a therapist. The way she treated you is by no means normal. It's downright awful. No one should be treated like that. I'm sorry you had to go through that. "
668,"I agree with /u/Population-Tire then. He needs therapy and to address the financial ties he has to his parents. 

I think you should both have a conversation of whether you want his parents in your future children's lives. I think expecting them to just be hands off wonderful grandparents is unrealistic, especially if they don't approve of you as his partner. "
669,"Girl, your boyfriend is the one who doesn't know boundaries! He needs to stand up to his mother and stop being a momma's boy and he shows zero indication that he wants to do that. Your boyfriend is the problem here, not his mother. "
670,"Start talking about your girlfriend, real or imaginary.  Nice shirt?  Thanks, my girlfriend picked it out for me.  "
671,"&gt; The only reason he is in my life is because our families are so intertwined and I am incredibly forgiving.

It might be time to start getting less forgiving. An ex who was abusive is not the kind of ex that's worth staying on ""good terms"" with, even for the sake of family/friends entanglement."
672,"Even if you are saying it in a friendly manner, he is probably still feeling defensive. Like imagine if your friend kindly told you she thought you made an unnecessary purchase. You would recognize her good intent, but probably still feel defensive."
673,"I think Sarah is clearly not a real friend, she's your buddy's gf which doesn't automatically make her your friend too. Getting somebody a job is a huge reflection on you and can make you look bad if it it works out negatively. You did the right thing and the fact that they're trying to call you sexist shows that they're most likely people you don't want to associate with. First impressions are important and Jamie made a bad one and sounds like that's nothing new. Imo you dodged a bullet, so cut them out of ya life because you don't deserve the drama or stress.   "
674,This should be higher. You're girlfriend seems to have extremely poor judgment.
675,"Do you have a friend you trust to keep it? If I were you, I'd pull out products for one full face (with maybe a couple of lipstick options) and get the rest out of the house. The makeup you keep with you stays in your purse next to you, or in a locked box. If your mom goes looking for something to steal, it's not like she'll be able to ask you where it went. If she does ask (ha!), say ""haven't seen that for a while! I thought you had it,"" or be slightly more confrontational and say ""I didn't loan that to you, so why were you looking through my makeup?""

It would mean limiting your cosmetic creativity until you move out,  but it will also mean that all of your makeup is safe and waiting to reunite with you when you head off to college. "
676,"Dude - you should have an issue with guys letching on women. Not on what women wear. This is like asking a girl who was raped what she was wearing - making a guys shitty behavior her fault. She can wear what she wants, when she wants. Husband here just needs to love it and get over his own insecurities. She won't leave him if he loves her and supports her and builds her up - she will be untouchable. But, if he tells her to change and tries to take deflate her confidence then maybe she will - because she will find a man that tells her how great she is. "

679,"Yes, thank you for adding this! There absolutely is hope. I had vaginismus in the past. I still have *some* struggles with PIV, but nothing like before. Now, just adding lube and making sure I'm relaxed, and of course, foreplay, is enough to have a great time! 

Definitely start with calling your doctor and go from there. "
680,"I think the bigger issue here is (ironically) less the marital infidelity than that you continued to maintain a close relationship with the man you had an affair with and his unsuspecting wife.  I honestly don't know how you make good on this, but if you don't at least try, I suspect you're going to lose your fiance forever.

I hope you can find a way through this mess.  Good luck."
681,WWIII if you tell her to get rid of them. She's your wife till death do you part or divorce which hopefully never happens. What's wrong with waiting longer??? You've got the rest of your life together. Animals are very much apart of her family. So what's the deal? Unless you think something else is going on...
682,"You clearly do not take wedding vows seriously. You knew Tommy was married and that didn't stop you from fucking him...for *3 months* that is no brief mistake or accident. Also, if you regarded martial vows so highly, why didn't you tell his wife? You were a willing participant in violating someone's marriage and you never did anything to atone for it.

And the lying by omission is outrageous! Your sly little ""teehee let's not talk about our sexual history"" -- I'm pretty sure that excludes owning up to having sexual history with someone you see often, regardless of whether or not that person is/was married.

In a moment, your fiancé got a glimpse of who (or *what*) you really are. You have a strikingly different opinion of yourself than what's being fleshed out here, I'd really take a hard look at that. "
683,"this is what i'm hoping for, we did recently lose a family member, and the stress of sorting out everything afterwards was stressful (arguments etc). "
684,"Okay, but it doesn't matter if this is just ""how you interact"", the fact that your girlfriend is pissed shows that she doesn't care about that - she was offended and that needs to be respected. "
685,"It's not healthy to obsess over any person, although not that uncommon.  

Spend more time with other people and your obsession will fade.  Try to go on other dates and ask friends to go out more, without your sister.

686,"&gt; how can I learn to cope with his anger in a healthy way instead of shutting down?

How do you stick your hand in fire without getting burnt? How do you smash your hand with a hammer without screaming? 

Your fear to your husband's aggressive behaviour is a natural response. It's natural and automatic. To learn how to not be affected by it would be to tell your body to shut down the processes that are there to keep you alive. I've heard of people in similar situations to you who have had their adrenaline sources shut down from overuse. Who've had their immunity systems shut down from stress. If you want to age yourself prematurely from the stress of constantly being in fight-or-flight mode, by all means, stick around. 

Or tell your husband that his explosive temper is having a negative impact on your health and your marriage, and his seeking anger management is crucial to the longevity of your marriage. 

&gt; He only gets ragey at me if I start criticizing him a lot, and then he just gets super frustrated and snaps (like, ""FUCKING FINE, I'LL DO [whatever], ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY?!"")

This is not a normal reaction. If you are afraid of airing your grievances to your husband for fear of his response, then you are not an equal in this relationship.

690,"Just so this is really clear to you, this is not normal or acceptable behaviour, regardless of him being ""the type of person who likes to impress others"". You do not have to be okay with this. There are so many red flags in your post. He has already cheated on you once before and still giving you nothing but excuses to justify his actions. "

It's also possible that she a perfectly reasonable human being, who has different opinions, boundaries and expectations about social media use than you do.

When you say shit like ""I could see myself marrying this person"" then you seriously owe it that person to treat their opinion with respect. Respect doesn't mean obedience but it does mean a hell of lot better than you've managed so far. Honestly, even if she turns out to be controlling—which could still happen—what is clearly fucking with you so much right now is that you are quicker to believe ""Bitches be crazy"" than to assume ""This person I care for may have a strong opinion which is different than mine."""
692,"Who exactly do you think you are to make anything clear to another adult, esp. regarding their personal choices? The only lines out there are the lines she chooses, you have no say whatsoever in how she dresses. How insecure must you be?!"
693,"Well, this puts a different perspective on the situation.

I mean, it doesn't really justify the way he dealt with you, which I think wasn't the best - grunting at someone does not sound like an ideal way to solve a problem.

On the other hand... I'm wondering here how bad your  attitude must have been to make someone, after 8 years together, have felt so bad and so displeased by what you did that the only way he could deal with you was to ignore you. He must have felt incredibly frustrated and humiliated if this was the first time he'd acted like this in almost a decade.

Again, I'm not saying this justifies his attitude, but it sure explains it. And because you're being so vague in describing the events, I can only conclude that they were really bad, which makes me instinctively want to take the side of your boyfriend in this situation.

-------------------

**EDIT:**

I think you really need to describe what you mean by ""spoiled"" and ""unappreciative"". 

Because this can follow in two directions. The first, is that you really acted in a terrible way, which may have been shocking to your boyfriend and he reacted badly, very badly. In this first case, you need to talk more and resolve that - he needs to learn how to deal with frustration more productively, and you absolutely need to sort out your emotional side.

The second direction... Is that what you actually did was no big deal. Your attitudes weren't so bad, on the contrary, they were trivial, nothing to be mad about. If that's the case, then your boyfriend's attitude takes on a completely different connotation, and in this case, perhaps your relationship is dysfunctional and you aren't revealing several other wrong things that may have happened in those 8 years. His attitude may have been really absurd here for all we know.

We are trying to analyze a singular act without the necessary context, and you are not even willing to describe what happened. You will hardly receive proper advice in this way."

It seems like he might feel reluctant to use this word in front of him. "
696,"I'm pretty sure it's normal for guys to be awkward/shy/intimidated by attractive women. I used to stutter and slur my words whenever I was around someone that I found attractive. It takes practice and changing your mindset. Approach talking to women as a chance to make a new friend, rather than to find a potential partner. Get to know someone first. I've got a list of conversation starters that I use to get to know someone and then eventually get their number.

Personally, I'm not as much of a fan of talking to women online to improve talking to them in person. It's just not the same. It's not easy to read into the tone of a message and it's not a good way to practice learning social cues. I ended up just talking to women on campus. Nowadays, I meet people through work, the gym, Tinder, the bar, clubs, music festivals, rock climbing, etc."

You need to stand up for yourself and your family here. I hope when she was sending those texts to your mom you weren't shrugging your shoulders because it was easier than confronting how awful her behavior was.

Surely you are aware that Superfund sites pose risk to human health, so to clean them up is generally considered a good thing?  I'm assuming you care about the environment and human health?

My wife is now unable to hold a steady job.

I don't believe she tells me the whole story, but whenever she works at a school, they let her go either immediately after the year is over, or in some cases even before that.

So now she will be working at a restaurant which will barely offer what must be provided to live a normal life.

Up to this point we've tried multiple things. First I worked, and she stood home. Money was tight, but she hated being home. 

Then she worked, and I stood home. I didn't like it, but it worked well. However she felt I didn't do enough, and wanted me to work a job, too. 

It didn't work out, since she always wanted me to call out. She was admitted another time again during that period.

She collected unemployment checks all inbetween as well, which I think added to her ""permanent vacation,"" state of mind.

Overall I am exhausted, and immensely depressed inside. I try so hard to be happy for my son and wife, but the weight is becoming 10 million demoralizing tons. It changes my personality and makes me less approachable to my boy. I hate that part the most, too.

I've tried exercising more, learning guitar, taking in adorable pets to take care of, but being married to someone who is like my worst enemy now is so confusing and hard to wake up to , especially after all the months of the same situation.

I hate waking up with my son alone, hearing my wife snore from lethargy, when I have to be happy and, make my son food, after being so depressed and insomniac'd out the night before trying to make peace with situation. To find any glimmer of a normalish reality.

I'm sorry for all of the venting, it's been a very confusing and hazy past couple of years. I guess because I try to forget how unsure it's all been, every day. I lose a lot of the details. Lack of good night sleeps hasn't been helping for the past few years.

What do people do in situations like this? I will not ever consider leaving my sons side. 

I've talked about how we can improve things so many times that I'm sick and tired of repeating myself.. and nothing ever changes anyway. Sometimes my wife tells me I'm just ""bashing,"" on her when I try to talk about how we can be more responsible and cleaner people.

Now... I've been contemplating taking my son and living in a shelter or with good friend until I can figure something out. 

I just want to do what is best for him. I don't want to take him away from his mother but this environment is so unhealthy as is. I argue often with my wife now. 

I tried talking about divorce even... but she doesn't want that either. I would have been happy to live together, as a separated couple for our child.

Something, anything. I don't know what options I have. Please, reddit, offer me guidance ?"

735,"I would agree with you regarding him not wanting the same things if he hadn't told me multiple times that this WAS what he wanted. He was the one who mentioned marriage first, actually. And the additional times he's asked me to marry him were completely without prompting. 

It wasn't ""getting married"" that was important to me, it was getting married to him. He's the only one I've ever wanted that with. 

As for doing what we had to in order to make the relationship work, my reference was in regards to what many relationships have to go through when there are bumps in the road. You figure out what is most important to each person, and you compromise if/when you have to in ways that work best for you both.

I do get what you're saying, though, and I appreciate the response. 

This entire night has definitely given me a lot to think about. "
736,Tell him to deal with it. You're an adult who has a past. He either needs to grow up or you need to find someone who can handle an adult relationship. Adults don't give other adults the silent treatment. 
737,"I think you and your wife are missing a big thing here... your daughter knew your wife didn't approve, so waited for her to be gone and went to you. She played you against each other. Regardless of how your wife feels about pageants, the fact is that your daughter knowingly went behind your wife's back, and didn't tell you ""hey Dad, Mom won't let me do this, but I want to for the following reasons..."", giving you the complete picture. 

Playing mom and Dad against each other is something 5 year olds do. Your daughter is old enough to know better, and should not be rewarded for this stunt. 

I would pull her out of the pageant for that reason alone. "

You keep trying to make people understand why you think it is ok and they keep telling you that you are wrong. I get that. And I also get how frustrating that could be. So let me try this example to show you how difficult talking to your parents/friends/etc is going to be. 

Imagine if your best friend told you she was secretly dating a 12 year old and that they were in love and were going to get married. Imagine the rush of queasiness at listening to someone about to go to college explain why she was in love with a 7th grader. What would you say? Would you be ok with it? What if she said she got his parents consent and was going to marry him next month? How hard would you try to talk her out of it? Creepy, no?

Well that is why you are getting the responses you are getting. I'm sorry but this is not going to end well. "

745,"It's not going to happen. He could be the nicest, sweetest, most compassionate man you've ever met, and all your family will see is a dude almost their age wanting to shack up with their legally adult daughter.

If this is the best relationship you've had, take it from someone who's seen this happen to a friend or two -- older men who pursue much younger women don't have to work hard to get them. They know you haven't been in enough relationships to know any better. They know that being an 'adult' sounds cool and fun and to be pursued by an older guy probably makes you feel mature af. Your love's gonna surpass all social barriers, taboo assumptions, etc. *Your love* will be beautiful enough that they'd write books on it.

When you're 18, you are ambitious to the point of idiocy. Give yourself maybe at least 5yrs, and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Lastly, every post here, you're defensive over the response. I'm gonna go out and take a risk and say what you REALLY are asking about is confirmation from strangers that this relationship isn't 'wrong'. BUT unfortunately, we're not doing that and it's creating a lot of discomfort and doubt, which makes you go on the defensive."

753,"Ditto. 
It sucks. 
It's triggering. 
It's also my problem, not yours or anyone else's. 
More to the point, though, part of recovery is about navigating every day triggers, like challenging foods so you can go to a friend's birthday party, or yes, exposed collarbones, so you can get to know your bro's girlfriend, etc. 
Don't change how you eat or dress. If you feel inclined, tell her you're very sympathetic to her struggles, and you have an open ear to talk... But you need to eat and dress appropriately for your own preferences. "

Secondly what really stood out to me ""why do you feel like you can't confront him?""  Even if you were snooping, you found something that warrants confronting him about? Does he make it difficult for you to confront him about things? 



Thirdly a) yes he could be using it to masturbate BUT b) he's looking up local escorts in your area. There's a very good chance he's using them and has used them. 


You should confront him. Do NOT mention that he might be using them to masturbate. ASK HIM why he has those tabs up and let him give you a reason as to why he's looking up escorts. I'm really sorry about this and please go and get tested. I don't want to further the stigma that prostitues are all sti riddled women but as a former escort myself I understood that sex workers have much higher risks and even though you can be as safe as possible due to random chances you can still catch something . So please  please go and get tested. 



I have no idea why people act like snooping is worse than potentially seeing escorts whilst in a relationship but Reddit never ceases to surprise me. "

 If OP had time to open and close a gate and the cousin did not notice then he should not even own a slingshot. 

In your other comment you mention that he was not expecting anything but his mum but what would have happened if it was police? His mum coming back from work early? FAMILY MEMBERS VISITING? A family friend? And frankly i doubt the gate was so large that a bad shot couldn't reach over and hit some innocent passerby.
He should be shooting in the opposite direction of people and buildings. And if that is not possible then he should cough up the money and rent a range. 

An arrow is potentially more lethal then a fire arm, it can be considerably bigger then a lot of bullets and can arc over objects. 

This is no more an accident then driving blind folded, sure you didn't mean to mow down a person but you certainly caused it through negligence, and thats what this is, pure stupid negligence and he needs to reap all the punishments he is getting from this if not more.

761,"My dad also deployed a lot. My mom and dad were insanely good at keeping their problems away from me and my sibling. I also deployed multiple times in just three years (my unit deployed a lot and judging by this I can tell yours does). 

1. Do not feel like it's your job to help her. Don't take this wrong, what I mean is don't get frustrated if it's not working.

2. Not much you can do. He's probably feeling the same way. I was in a four year relationship during my first deployment, both ends suck. I guarantee his sucks a lot more idc what anyone says. Reason why I say this is not to compare but to let you know not to tell him. Especially if they rarely talk because in between talks this can drive his thoughts crazy. 

3. A love for a child is stronger than a love for a spouse but theres different  chemicals. What she's experiencing, biologically, is withdrawal. So again, I can't stress this enough, this isn't your burden. I do thank you for being compassionate about the situation.

What can you do?

1. Take her mind off things. Not ""taking her out to dinner,"" blah blah. She's a mother. Make her feel like a mother. You have a problem with school? Ask her for help. Make her feel wanted. Got boy troubles? Talk. Anything. Taking her out is nice but adults are not stupid. She will know why you're doing it. 

2. Be happy. Lol harder said than done and it contradicts what's I said on number one but psychologist have theorized that people mimic others. You smile? People often smile back. Smiling itself can make you happy if you do it long enough. If she sees her daughter happy I guarantee she will be happy.

3. Again going against one, but reduce stress. Low on money? Don't ask for it to go out with friends. I don't know your families stress nor do I need to know but lower it. 

4. Let her cry. Her husbands gone. This can make her feel better. She's not cleaning? Pick up the slack so she can cry. 

I have to cut this short. Take mine, and everyone's advice with a grain of salt. I wasn't on the other side. I was the one deployed. My pops deploying didn't affect me (he was abusive and sort of a drunk).

Neither are justifications for cheating! She doesn't even seem remorseful since she told you over 7 years later and only brought it up when she made you promise to forgive her *before* you even knew what you were forgiving her for.

"
766,"Along with the other comments, she could be looking at your connections to see if she knows anyone else you know rather than search every name she can think of.

Like you said, she's new. It could be a lot of reasons. But as long as she's not treating anyone different and you aren't getting a negative vibe, I wouldn't think to much about it."

768,"your stepmom is a real goddess incarnate (but i'm pretty sure you already knew that!). seriously, every part of this update has me grinning from ear to ear. not only is every step your SM took beautifully planned, it resulted in a lovely wedding and a closer bond with the family that's looking out for you. i'm so happy for you, OP! "
769,"Haha, I've had a bunch of threesomes. Usually not a lot of planning goes into it. A couple has a single friend, they're all attracted to each other, and one night they're drinking together and someone makes a joke about how wouldn't it be funny if they had a threesome, and then it just... escalates."
770,"&gt; you cant really blame him for not disclosing that information earlier

I think you can, and ill tell you why

Due to the fact that the boyfriend already said that the friend is ""like a sister""

I suspect op already had a gut feeling and questioned him, said that she was jealous or something like that.

I dont feel that this situation is new

And then he goes with

""Oh you dont have to worry! She is like a sister to me""

And then, not so much of a sister some time later

Sure this is speculation, but... possible."
771,I'm sorry you were blindsided but you don't know the whole story.  Talk to your parents but their history if their history and really none of your business.  You're 18 now so date who you want to date.
772,"It sounds like she just needs some space to sort through her emotions. If her comment holds any validity that she has previously been violent this is probably a good approach for her to try.

 I know I personally go to our room if I know on some level I'm having a knee jerk emotional response to a disagreement with my husband. It allows the ""heat of the moment"" to dissipate so a simple disagreement doesn't turn into a larger fight and we talk about it later when I can look at the logical side without the emotional confounding things. 

So let her know you are willing to talk when she feels up to it and go hang out in the living room so she doesn't have to hide in the bathroom. 


As to the ex gf I think your solution is a good compromise because I know I wouldn't feel comfortable with my hubs spending the night somewhere his ex was. "
773,"Your parents are flawed human beings and this feeling you have towards them will go away and you will love them just the same. I had something similar happen to me at 18. I found out my mom was previously married to a man named Doug, which was a bombshell all on its own. Then I come to learn that my dad was Doug's best friend at the time of my mom's marriage to Doug. Didn't take too long to piece together they started their relationship a shady way. It was weird but time heals all and now I don't ever think badly about it, it just is. You will get over this and you will make mistakes all the same, hopefully some of your mistakes end in a happy marriage like theirs. "
774,You did something incredibly shitty. It's hard to feel bad for you when you don't even seem  to assume full responsibility for what you did. You need to work on yourself before you are equipped to date again.
775,"'I don't want her to be hurt'.

Too bad. It's already happened, she just doesn't know yet. Just get it done in a clean, straight-forward way and hope she understands. Best of luck with your ex."
776,"pretty much this OP ^^^^. There's a difference between saying ""your friend is pretty"" and flirting with her and ignoring your SO all night. "
777,"It got to the point that others were addressing it at the party. He knew what he was doing. He was just arrogant enough not to care. 

I'm not sure I could stay after those comments and behavior but I understand this seems out of the blue and you have commitments together. So if you do want to maintain this relationship you're gonna likely need to bring in a professional. Counselling together and alone. He's behaved cruelly and when it was addressed, responded with even more, pointed cruelty. "
778,"Come on. You're dating a gigantic asshole, pumpkin. "
779,"""I wish I had tried harder to find her before calling so they wouldn't be so upset.""

I don't get why your blaming yourself for the police and ss getting in on this.  There are people out there that mistakenly forgot their child and that lead to something terrible and wished someone could of told them.

It sounds like this woman has postpartum depression.  If she confronts you about how upset she is... open her eyes and tell her she needs to be seen ASAP.  She could be playing the victim while wishing someone would take her child."
780,This...what happens when he gets old(er) and can't wipe himself? Are you willing to take care of him when he can't take care of himself?
781,That's a fucking leap from what OP said. Jesus christ
782,"""My intention is not to praise myself or degrade women."" ........ *spends entire post praising himself*

I'm not sure what your question is exactly. If you're having problems with women maybe try getting a nice voice tone, or a calm mind perhaps."

785,"so your wife is working overnight shift, is that correct? so you want her to come home in the morning after working all night, do all the housework stuff during the day, make dinner etc. and then sleep for a few hours before she goes into work again that night. which would mean she would pretty much only see the kids at dinner.

and stop saying you HELP her. why is maintaining the household something that's supposed to fall totally on her shoulders with you just 'helping' here &amp; there? you live there too. these are your children as well.

google THE MENTAL LOAD COMIC and see if it rings any bells for you."
786,"So what do you do around the house? 

If the answer is nothing, maybe you should start pulling your weight."
787,Your boyfriend is a fucking loser. Hottest girl he's ever hit on? What is he in middle school?
788,"Women can tell when you want to snag one for the sake of having a girlfriend.

A relationship should be about living your life and along comes something that makes you think 'hm, I could see myself starting a relationship with this person'

NOT 'holy fuck I want a girlfriend so badly please hot women come fill this empty hole in my life' "
789,"OP, your son desperately needs counseling, and it's not because he's a sociopath. It's because he's been abused and terrorized by his mother since he was a preteen and because his stepfather hid at work rather than protect him. Neither one of you taught him how to love or care. Your wife taught him that lasting out in violence is okay when you're disappointed, and it's a miracle that he's not getting into fights as a result. She also taught him that the only reason to try in life is to avoid violence or punishment. Now that she can't hit him and you won't, he has no motivation. Meanwhile, you taught him that the best way to deal with difficult situations is to detach emotionally and hide away. He's doing with you all exactly what you did when your wife was beating him. 

Seriously, apologize wholeheartedly to this kid and get him counseling, both individual and family. If your wife won't join in, just go with him. And please, please, please protect your daughter better than you have your son. You can't turn back time for him, but you can at least prevent your wife from abusing your daughter when she inevitably gets less than perfect grades. "
790,"&gt; If we think you're pretty, we wanna have sex with you  

Speak for yourself man. "

792,Why would you need help not dying thoug?
793,"&gt; I feel he could potentially do better in a home that could use clay litter and potentially one that is less loud/busy.

IMO that is not enough.  If you are serious about the idea of rehoming him you should test these conditions and find out for sure.  Maybe by committing to take allergy medication for a month and trialing clay litter in the basement, or having someone informed in a quieter household take him for a few weeks.

I think it would be smart to up the playing again.  I have a feral with some similar issues and when I don't satisfy her prey drive the energy seeps out in other ways."
794,"Good God how does this even happen? Triplets and now twins??

Go to therapy. Go to therapy NOW. Insist on hiring help. Look into preschool for the kids when the babies are born. Move a relative in short term. Do WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO to survive.

Also. Would she be open to one of those smushmortions? "
795,"They didn't even read your post lol some of the things they were asking questions about you had already clearly addressed at the very beginning of it!! It's clear to me that's you're compassionate and love all your animals, I hope you find a solution to the pee problem so that Boy Cat can stay with you. If not, I'm sure your family will work hard to find him a great new home. "
796,"They both have a passion for travel, good eating, and good drinking.  For fuck sake they both binge watch popular TV shows and enjoy cinema.

You don't just stumble upon this.  They both love to laugh!"
797,"Hey op you remind me a lot of my old man, similar circumstances.  I'm 37 now but 10 years ago when I got married had a similar situation to this.  My pops argued to get his way in the wedding and I caved.  I thought I was being diplomatic so everyone would be happy but I wasn't.  One of my great regrets is not standing up to pops and telling him, much like your daughter did, to play by my rules or don't come.

"
798,"Similarly, he could reach out to the pastor of their church and say that he wants to aid in her recovery. I would make finding out the name of the facility and contacting her priority one. 


Even if he has to spend a full day calling all of the facilities in their region and asking to speak to his sister. "

Nor should she."
805,"I don't think you're unreasonable. 

I think maybe you and your sister would benefit from a little family counseling to help deal. It sounds like you're holding a little resentment about your brother not being old enough to make an informed decision and I'd hate to see this fester and grow. 

Is your mom divorcing your dad finally?? Because if not, she should be. I'd encourage your mom to reach out to a lawyer (most do free consults) and see what her options are. Also maybe some counseling for her to help her confront and stand up to him. I hate to say, but it sounds like your mom's self esteem is in the toilet and she's afraid to leave him even though it's clear that he's an abusive cheating turdnugget. Plus they have kids so I'm sure he uses that against her too. "

Being a telecommunicator is an extremely strwrssful job and every dispatch center I've worked around (I'm up to 5 in 3 different states) has been high-stress, high-turnover. It takes a very particular kind of person to enjoy and be good at it so make sure she likes it/can handle the emotional and mental toil of the job before you make any drastic changes."

811,"it's one night.

i understand it being an inconvenience, but that's all it really is. it sounds like they'll be out at night then just crashing at your place, and leaving the next day, is that correct?

if you have things of value in the living room you're concerned about, move them into your bedroom for the night.

apparently this is something that's important to your BF. someday there will be something important to you that he doesn't want to do, but will. "
812,"Girl, your boyfriend is a Schrödinger's asshole. This is defined as: ""A person who says something offensive, then waits to see the reaction it gets before deciding whether to claim it was a joke.""

He doesn't care if it hurts your feelings; in fact, the intent is probably to hurt your feelings so he can take more of your effort, time and energy. Is this a quality you want in a partner? "
813,"So the writing is on the wall? Sounds like this whole pressuring to improve your paternal relationship is a deal breaker. 

I have a similar relationship with my mother. When people tell me I *should* try to repair our relationship I tell them simply, you weren't there, so please don't tell me how to live my life. Things are like this for a reason. 

Not everyone has perfect childhoods or relationships with their parents, but they shouldn't push their ideals on you or try to emotionally manipulate you to do so. "
814,"I've been through one of these programs, too. My heart is racing. To say that the experience fucked me up is an understatement. I don't know how many of us are left because I lost touch when I left the country, but the story is similar. Lot of suicides and ODs. 

Unfortunately, there's nothing OP can do. A lawyer won't help because this is legal. Children in America have no real rights and no recourse. It might be different if he was a co-parent or guardian, but he isn't. 

The only thing he can do is never speak to his parents again, outlive them, and piss on their graves. That, and be there for his sister when she gets out.

825,"Hey! Glad you responded :) 
Genuine question - how is it selfish? She doesn't ""owe "" it to anyone to work on a day that's not included in her availability. 
I work retail and I haven't worked a Sunday in more than four years. No joke. I took it out of my availability for multiple reasons that guess what, I don't have to justify to anyone, and I have said no to people's faces asking me to pick up a shift for them. Not that I haven't felt bad and helped them find someone else, but I know that once I start occasionally working that day it's all systems go and I'll find myself working Sundays often which is not something I want. I'm no less committed to my job than those who work Sundays and I'd get miffed if someone told me that. My managers seem more helpful than yours - if I get booked against my availability then it's their problem not mine and I drop it in their lap to fix. So how exactly does your scheduling work? As in, can you book off a particular day as a guarantee or is it more of managers having to remember to not book so and so on this day too often bc they prefer not to work then? I hate closing. Everyone I work with knows this. However, bc it's still included in my availability I sometimes get booked for them and though they suck, I show up and do my job. My boss tries not to do it often which is nice and I appreciate, but it's never a guarantee and that's more than an even trade. I appreciate the favour. But if I took closing shifts out of my availability and I still got booked for them then damn straight I'm not working them, and will call off if needed bc that's not my problem. 
I totally get it that she called off before her availability was put through, and that does suck! Get mad, complain to managers, etc, since everyone including your boss knows why. If someone arbitrarily didn't show for a shift cuz they're partying I would get mad too. But is it her fault or the system's fault that she's able to do so without penalty? It's not playing the system if someone is able to call in at the last minute withou finding someone to cover it if there are no check holders in place to stop her from it. It sucks, but it's not 'illegal' in that sense. My work has rules in place for no-shows if it happens too many times on shifts within your availability before they fire you, which is fair. "
826,"Wait did you say 5 days? As in less than a week? Put in the brakes and get out. 

Even if you had no mental health issues this is too fast. "
827,"I do those things. I wipe the counter everytime. But i do not clean the entire floor if i dropped something. I pick it up and throw it out. I also don't clean the surfaces of the cupboards weekly. The rest i do. I clean the stove after using. But a minor spill does not lead to me mopping the entire floor. What I know for sure is that none of the other two guys do that either. But they've known him longer so maybe that's why he's just so radical with me. 


edit: a word"
828,"The tv you were going to toss and it's broken so you can't claim it as a gift. 


The cart. 

What money did it cost you to repair?
Your wife took it to the bike repair shop and then messaged your SIL, why? Did she/you expect her to pay for something she basically never uses?
And finally, did you offer to buy the cart off them since if their willing to watch a tv with a black spot, they are obviously hard up for cash. "

So maybe this is her first taste of what she's getting into...which is why she doesn't want to go to the funeral, etc."
830,"i used to babysit for a woman whose boys were 5 and 2. i was the very first babysitter she agreed to. for FIVE YEARS that woman had refused to even go out to dinner b/c of her fear of what might happen if the kid(s) were out of her sight. she of course left me a list of instructions that went on for about 5 pages. this was before cell phones so it included the number for the restaurant (obviously), the home number of their pediatrician, and probably the number for a local priest LOL. and of course she stepped away from the table to call and check in at least 3 or 4 times during the dinner. eventually she became comfortable enough with me that she was able to go out a few times per month. her husband was so incredibly grateful that i had somehow managed to instill some semblance of sanity into her freakish fear that he used to pay me exorbitant amounts of money. granted, he was a bigshot on wall street and made a shitload of money, but he was literally giving me a couple hundred dollars to babysit for a just a few hours.

the following holiday season i was slated to do something early morning on new years day, so i had decided to stay in on new years eve. when he found out i would be available to babysit (of course they hadn't been out for the last 5 new year's eve celebrations) he was so excited he paid me over $1000, and sent me &amp; a friend on a weekend holiday in miami.
