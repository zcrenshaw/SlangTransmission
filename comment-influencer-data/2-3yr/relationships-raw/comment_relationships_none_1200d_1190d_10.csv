1,You don't have to be the maid just because he makes more money. Do you think he would do the same if he got paid less? Yoy are supposed to be partners
2,"I'm my group's prankster and simply saying ""I forgot my wallet"" and waiting for one fearful heartbeat would be approaching the line.

But talking to the waiter, manager, calling OP poor, and having the police mentioned is completely classless and cruel."
3,"&gt; How many people get an all expenses paid two year vacation in Hawaii WHILE getting a free college degree?

Except that they're not paying to send you on vacation.  They're shipping you off to this church you know nothing about.  You might never wind up having any leisure time because you'll constantly be pressured into doing additional volunteer work or activities.

If this really sounds like something you might want to do anyway, then do your research and decide.  But as long as you're not taking out more than you expect to earn back, a little debt is not necessarily the worst thing in the world, and it's a small price to pay for the freedom to shape your life the way you want it.  If I were you, I'd use this as incentive to think about how *you* want to get yourself out of your rut, and come up with a plan for making that happen."
4,"So, you are monogamous and straight and he doesn't respect those facts. He doesn't respect that you want this behavior to stop. 

Even if you were bi, declaring that to a total stranger and using that as a way to take this stranger home **without even discussing it with you** is not okay in any way. 

Be extremely clear that this behavior is not okay with you. That he doesn't get to decide your sexuality, tell other people what he has decided you are, and try to invite people into your bedroom using you as an excuse. If he tries to defend it, shut him down. "
5,"Ok, these are the apparent facts:
1)S is recently hired and in less than 6 months is promoted. (Not blatantly suspicious but it's questionable)
2)S tells you HERSELF that she doesn't have the qualifications for such a promotion.
3)Other workers who have worked there longer, and most likely have the qualifications, get passed over for the promotion.
4)Lastly, (huge conflict of interest) your manager is in a sexual relationship with one of his subordinates.......a new staff member who just happens to get promoted and moved from a department that suddenly gets eliminated.

Looks like L knew in advance that your Department was going to be eliminated and thus put things in motion ahead of time to save S from getting cut.


I don't think it's too late to take a stand and expose this obvious conflict of interest and ""quid pro quo"". Unless you were replying to her messages with words of encouragement/approval (""Wow, i wish I could do/get away with something LIKE that."" ""You're so lucky.""), then you should be ok.

And just like another poster stated, your job has already been indirectly eliminated. You have nothing to lose!"
6," &gt;I am pretty flirty. I acknowledge it, and *I treat everyone the exact same*. I flirt with girls, guys, people with SOs, gay people. I let people know this from the get go and everyone jokes about it.

Unrelated but be careful with this behavior in SE Asia"

8,"Also please report this to your professor at the very least.  Teachers, aids, whoever is in charge of the course need and want to know when this sort of thing goes on."
9,Well number 1 is report your coworker to HR for sexual harassment. This will demonstrate to your wife that you were not a consenting party to this text message and that you didn't like it. 
10,"&gt; This is kind of a red flag. 

Her brothers girlfriend is upset because she thinks he's going to start **fucking his sister** because she doesn't dress like a nun, and went behind his back to basically accuse him of that.

&gt; This is ~~kind of~~ a huge fucking red flag."
11,"Oh, dear. I wish I was there and could hug you.

He is the one who is full of poison, not you.

Nothing that he is experiencing is because of your status. You have every right to be angry!  And if I were you, I'd leave him.

&gt;I don't want to stomp on what seem to be genuine spiritual beliefs

There are genuine spiritual beliefs that go ""Those guys in the other valley are hated of our god, and so we must destroy them."" Doesn't mean that the guys in the other valley should roll over and take it.  

You aren't stomping on a belief by going ""Yeah, uh, that is some heinous abusive shit you're pointing at me, and I'm not going to sit around and let you keep doing it.""

OP, are you seeing a therapist? This has to be really heavy and awful for you, and the phobia is unlikely to heal up on its own.  Seeing a pro can give you coping mechanisms and new tools of thought to help get you out from under the dark."
12,"That's awesome and it gives me hope :)

Also, I want to add that I think it's awesome that you and your ex are still very good friends. You're clearly rooting for their relationship and it's refreshing to see!"

14,"Your BiL is 30 though

the appropriate inappropriate social thing to do at that age for weddings is to get blackout drunk and start a fight, not make a lame joke that you might see in a children's cartoon."
15,"Your mother may also be a victim, but the thing is, she is the *parent*. It was her duty to provide a safe environment for her children, and she failed to do so. Now that she's being called out on it, she wants the sympathy because she refused to accept and acknowledge what was going on under her own roof and pretty much under her watch. 
She not only failed you by not protecting you, but she also failed your sister by not getting her the help she clearly needed. Whether she was too afraid to do more than some cursory therapy or it was just easier to pretend all was okay and ""deal with it"", I don't know, but the point is, as a mother, she failed you both in different, but severe, ways. She is not just a parent in denial, she is downright neglectful

I'm sorry that your sister abused her too, but as the parent, she should never have let it get that far. 
I understand she has a disability that makes it harder for her to do those things, but that's zero excuse for not stepping up and being the parent in this situation. 
There's plenty of help out there for those who search for it. 

You're making excuses for your mom because it's easier to see her as a victim along with yourself than it is to accept that she did you wrong. 

Your mother is probably not a bad person, but she is a weak person."
16,"He doesn't have to know the definition of ""negging"" to do it you.  If he is so ignorant he doesn't get that he is being malicious and cruel to you, you would benefit from not being his friend.  If he is so ignorant that he thinks a 5'3"" girl is fat at 126 pounds -- and he's been called out on his crass comments -- you don't need a friend that ignorant.  However, imho, he knows exactly what he's doing and is trying to make/keep you insecure and anxious for some weird reason. I do not believe he is benign in his intentions."
17,"Oh, honey. No. You do not need to talk to him alone. Do not be alone with him.  You don't owe him anything. NOTHING. 

Can you talk to the person in charge of the interns? Do you have someone on the floor like an RA? This is not something you need to handle alone. You should tell people that you trust what's going on. Stop being nice to him. Only be professional. 

I'm sure others will have more advice to offer but I want to reiterate that you don't need to talk to him alone (and shouldn't).  "
18,"Listen to this person, OP! Your wife just found out she's pregnant, and you're pulling the silent treatment on her? What the hell? She will never, ever forget this. Your behavior is childish and just plain cruel, and whenever she thinks of this time in her life, she will remember it with this enormous stain. That hurts. You need to work on your communication skills, stat. The silent treatment is a sign of real problems.

Also, it's a bit late now, but you should never have asked her to rank you or the sister ""first."" It's not fair, it's not right, and it's not productive. I love my husband to the moon and back, but if he asked me if my brother, with whom I am extremely close, came ""first,"" I don't think I could answer truthfully without hurting any feelings. It's also a very complicated question, because there are so many ways to think about it. In many ways, my husband would be ""first,"" but there are other ways in which my brother would be. At the end of the day, it's probably more of a ""tie,"" but I'm not sure that would make anyone feel any better if I were forced to explain the whole thing. Other people's emotional lives, including your wife's, are complicated things, and I don't think it's right for you to demand total primacy.

Finally, many women would have shared this news with a best friend, sister, or mother before the husband, especially very early in the pregnancy, and especially if they were scared about losing the baby, which most women are when it's this early on. I frankly find it somewhat controlling that you feel the need to punish her when she ""chose wrong"" on this."
19,"The guy gives you $10,000 to help with your brother's surgery, and you're making this about how stressful that gift was for you? Seriously, you don't fucking deserve him. I try to be helpful the few times I post in this sub, but I have nothing to say to you beyond grow the fuck up "
20,"It sounds like he's ready for kids now and you aren't. That's just an incompatibility in your relationship that won't change. 

But for the love of Pete, if you don't want a child, stop having unprotected sex! You are playing with fire here. You are only 23, you have an entire decade to decide if you want kids. Don't let your relationship pressure you into something you don't want. "
21,"You don't have to know what the issue is. You don't even have to solve it. (This may sound harsh, but its actually better for children to figure out their own issues with each other than have their parents step in an mediate. Long term, they will have a better relationship this way)

What you do have to do is set ground rules for what is appropriate behavior (e.g. You will not insult or condescend your sibling), and be willing to punish either of them if they misbehave.

You can (and should) sit them down and say something along the lines of ""you two have been at each other since Yasha came home. I don't care why this, what I do care is that you are both acting horribly. That stops now, you do not have to like each other, but you will act with politeness and respect. If you do not, I will have no choice but to ground you."""

23,Underrated comment of the day.
24,"Cutting off outside social supports is like one of the top five priorities of an abuser before they ramp up to violence. I guess OP's lucky he's being really fucking blatant about it? (And yeah he might not escalate to violence, but even if he doesn't losing his temper over small shit and never knowing when it's going to happen or what you've done to cause it is really unhealthy to live with just by itself.)"

27,"Please just get away from him op. If you want some perspective, just hang out on  this subreddit for a while and read stuff a bit. Maybe reading about other people/s similar experiences will help you see the situation more clearly. 

Your bf's brother is a great guy. Whatever you do, don't cut ties with him, even if it means breaking up with your bf. "
28,"Going to your sister seems like it would just be upsetting for you, and unhelpful.  He's not going to listen, 'cause he's a huge creep.

The best way to deal with a creep is to deny them the satisfaction they're getting.  He loves making you feel uncomfortable, because then he feels powerful.

The easiest way to deal with this is to suddenly develop a hearing problem.  Every time he says something like this to you, repeat it back to him (loudly.)  So it goes like this:

""What?  What did you say?  YOU SAID MY BOOBS LOOK GREAT TODAY? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?""

Sound clueless, and sound loud.  Everyone else will stare - at him.  He no longer gets the rush of forcing you to try and not make a scene, he doesn't get the rush of watching you be uncomfortable and skeeved out.  Instead, everyone knows what he said."
29,"Please listen to this advice OP.  Her attachment is fueled out of grief, not happiness for you.  Its not love, its envy and its possession.  This is terribly unhealthy and I almost feel that the harshness of your response was because you were actually, subconsciously, perceiving a very real threat to you and yours.  That doesn't mean it wasn't incredibly heartbreaking, but I'd listen to that gut instinct.  

Best possible outcome?  That response kicks her back into reality and she can finally move on.  But I don't think its wise to continue this friendship, and I don't think a face-to-face apology is the safest option.  Do it over email or text, and just keep an eye out.  Good luck!"
30,"She should get IUD if she can, or the shot or implant. Because he can't find those."

Where do you think she will be next time she goes for ""drinks""?  
Sorry her actions are way too defensive for nothing happening.  
Good Luck"
33,"I would do a couple of things. 

I could contact your landlord in writing and explain that you and your roommate did NOT approve this dog, have had nothing to do with the descision, and as a result, do not feel that you should lose your deposit due to the damage the dog has caused, and that all damages caused by the dog MUST be billed to Carly. 
 
Then I would draw up a contract with Carly, that you and roommate will provide pet sitting services (i.e. letting the dog out) for $10 per time (or whatever fee you want) and if the dog is not let out on an appropriate schedule (for puppies, they recommend age of the puppies in months + 1 to determine the number of hours the dog can go without a break, so if the puppy is 6 months old, then it can't go more than 7 hours without a potty break) you will report it to animal control (or whatever the appropriate agency is in your area.) 

I would write a letter to whatever campus service is that recommends these ESAs, and explain the situation, as well, and the impact it is having on you. 
 
I would even consider a letter to your campus newspaper - ""My Roommate's ESA Is Ruining Our Lives - Why It's Irresponsible For Just Anyone to Have an ESA"". 

And lastly, I would talk to legal services on your campus, to see what can be done about the loss of deposit that she should have to pay. 
 
"
34,"No. You are UNDERreacting.

Why is this still even a ""boyfriend"" situation? I mean, dude... Dudette... You had to physically RUN away from him. You LITERALLY RAN AWAY for fear of your personal safety.

Leave him yesterday. Then, for your own sake, take some time and work on yourself. We can never truly expect to be loved by another if we don't first love ourselves."
35,"Yup. They just showed where they place him on their totem pole.

He's their ""poor friend"" and they're gonna treat him like a dog cuz they're assholes."
36,"Off topic, but is $1000 a month really an ""absurd"" amount to support three children? In my city that wouldn't even cover daycare for ONE of the kids."

38,"This guy has one foot out the door of your relationship. It sounds like if Megan crooked her finger he'd come running and forget you in a heartbeat. 

Don't be a placeholder."
39,"They have been together for five years, meaning she was 22 when they started dating and he was 39. He has had a lot more time to settle himself into a comfortable living situation, and makes much more than OP, but holds her at the same standard when it comes to finance as he is now, not himself over 15 year ago.

She's paying probably close if not more in rent for the apartment he has (Honestly if he is making six figures, IMO, he shouldn't have to rent). 50/50 doesn't work if one is making 6 times more than the other."
40,"That says enough. DO NOT APOLOGIZE

He thinks you are wrong and you are the reason he is angry. And adults dont shout over multiple rooms, they talk.

Get a hotel for the night."
41,"Yeah, this was kind of my general feeling as well, but I wasn't sure if maybe I'm being completely unreasonable and unable to see it..

I can't believe this is even a consideration in my mind, I actually broke up with someone in order to move and study, so I seem to have lost track of my priorities a little bit 😕

Now I only need to figure out how to settle this and tell him it's not happening (and have a plan in mind if we do break up over it on how to get my stuff from our shared apartment). "
42,[removed]
43,"Yeah OP never should have engaged in conversation at all, it should have been ""get out of my house now or I am calling the police!"" If she doesn't immediately start moving towards the door you get a phone and start dialing. 

When I had a similar situation with my ex walking into my house, uninvited, all I had to do was say this(and mean it) and she left and she never comes into the house uninvited anymore, which means she never comes into the house because I've never invited her in."
44,"What the hell, guys? How are so many people focusing on ""he chose you, that's what's important?""

OP has some serious insecurity issues, that is true. But if my fiancé waited until we were engaged and I was drunk to mention that his best friend and him had actually had a sexual relationship and they weren't just ""friends,"" I'd feel lied to and betrayed.

I don't have a problem with opposite-gendered friendships, but there's a difference between ""she's like a sister to me"" kind of friendship and the ""we hooked up"" kind of friendship. Additionally, it sounds like OP doesn't even trust that it was just once...he does have a tendency to adjust the truth to fit his needs. I'd be afraid the ""we slept together once"" is a trickle-truth to ""we dated for four years.""

OP, talk to your boyfriend about why he hid this from you for so long. And talk to a therapist about your insecurity. I don't blame you for reacting shittily- I'd react shittily, too."
45,"Never negotiate with a terrorist. Ignore her. If she follows through, go to the police."
46,"Well from his point of view I can understand. I have two friends that are very wealthy. They never pushed it in people's faces because they were brought up right. However, in both cases when a GF found out the dynamic of their relationship changed. Expectations and entitlement crept in and it destroyed both relationships. They are far more guarded about their wealth now because of it.


I just want to add...your BF is not responsible for your guilt. He helped, you accepted. He didn't need to explain himself."
47,"He keeps saying it because he wants it to be true. 

Tell him that under no circumstances is he to bring it up again. You are not, have never been, and will never be into the idea of sleeping with another woman. Establish what you feel comfortable as the consequences for if he brings it up again (in public or private). The stick to it. 

Whether he wants to admit it or not, he keeps saying that your are bisexual because he wants you to be bisexual."
48,"I would take this as either, you were a casualty of some girls insecurity or parents about having single people around at the party, or a way of pushing you out. Would there be any reason they wouldn't want you at the party specifically? Could you ask other people who went if they knew it was couples only and when they knew? 

Personally, changing requirements like that so last minute is rude, especially given the way your friend told you. I think you should focus on other friendships, this friend sounds like a jerk. I wouldn't bring it up, but rather just distance yourself from them a bit. Since you still will have school with them for a bit, no sense in creating any more drama that will make school awkward. "
49,I told him that it seemed like he was ok with cheating and he said absolutely not but that it was between them and we should give Dave a chance to tell her himself. But I don't know if I believe that now.

And this isn't the kind of thing you just yell out in anger. Combined with the Cradle Rocking behavior, I'd be really concerned."
55,Right from the abuser's playbook. 
56,I don't even THINK that kind of stuff about my SO though. Some of that is just plain mean. I'd talk to him about it. You can't unsee what you saw but he can start making you feel better (if you even stay) by telling you all the positive things he does love about you.
57,"She knew the name. Shes insecure about it, you probably mentioned it at some point. Ask her to ask granpa for more details.

Id agree to counseling, she does seem to need it. None of this new age stuff though, tell her to make a concession on that, you are agreeing to go to counseling over a ouija board, the least she can do is go to a regular councilor. 

If she truly believes she is speaking to a spirit on her ouija board, maybe remind her that it might not be her grandpa who told her that, apparently those things dont always conjure up ""nice"" spirits (im not a believer, but do some research and come at it from her angle/beliefs)

Finally though, id be just plain furious. And make her aware in no uncertain terms that she is damaging the marriage with the mistrust. 
"
58,"Holy shit! Sweetheart, I know this sub over recommends therapy sometimes but you need it. A lot of it. Your desperation is cringeworthy and so very palpable. The way you talk about yourself, it's clear that you don't like yourself, much less love yourself. This is an open invitation for someone to treat you like crap because you're so focused on being a Mrs that you don't care about anything else. You need to take some time and work on you or it won't get any better."
59,[removed]
60,"&gt; I need to tell her what they will be doing

That's why I said ""related to co-parenting"" only. 

Pickup and drop off time and location coordination, sure. Planning any deviations of normal visitation schedule due to holidays, special events, or summer camp, absolutely. Addressing problems the kids are having, of course.

But other than that, no, you don't need to account for how you and your kids spend your time together. She'll probably find out after the fact from the kids, but that's ok.

The only other exception I can think of is giving her a heads-up when *traveling somewhere else* (going camping in the wilderness, or driving out of town), just for safety's sake. My parents are divorced, and we used to go camping and hiking and fishing with my dad all the time; I didn't know until very recently that *he never told my mother where in the vast Cascade mountains he was taking us*, even after she begged him to just tell *someone* where we would be, so they'd have somewhere to start looking if we never made it back."
61,"Yes, I think you are very right to be concerned. You've been very vigilant, and I agree that the red flags you have identified here are all concerning things.

At the very least, he is too close to this woman in an emotional sense. He seems to be going out of his way to spend time with her - including time alone!"
62,"Boom. Listen to this advice, OP. It sounds like you might be dating my ex.

He got laid off. I was looking for a better job to try to fill in the gaps. I was running crazy. I did the chores, the errands, went to interviews, did the pre employment physicals (my field usually requires them), put out life's little brush fires, put out life's BIG brush fires, I did everything.

What did he do? Fuck all. Never once offered to help, contribute, or support in any way.

I remember one day in particular. It was the worst. I wasn't feeling well. I was stressed, tired, and hungry. The night before one of the cats had made an unbelievable mess. I had to clean it up and replace something he had broken. In the process, he had cut a paw, and was at the vet. I had an interview, I had errands to run, I had applications to fill out. I had no clean clothes and no groceries.

I was in tears. Completely overwhelmed.

Ex BF called up and said ""Remember we have a dinner to go to tonight."" I explained what was going on, that I probably wouldn't have time to go.

Did he offer to not go to help me? Did he offer to help so we could both go? Did he even express that he had to go, but would leave ASAP and come help me after? Nope. He just said ""OK"", peaced out, went to dinner, and went home.

He didn't want the yucky parts of a relationship. He didn't want the stressful days, the difficult times, the occasional emotional meltdown, the sacrifices that sometimes had to be made. He wanted a show pony to take places so he could say he had a girlfriend. He was in no way a boyfriend.

I remember being at the end of my rope one night when he had dropped me on my head yet again, left me holding the bag while he flounced off to go do whatever, and I screamed at him ""God dammit, if I'd WANTED to raise a child I'D HAVE HAD ONE!!! Why do I have to walk you through EVERYTHING??? Why do I have to babysit to make sure you do what you say you'll do???""

And that's when I realized it was over. I wasn't resentful, I just had ZERO respect left for him. I looked at him as another responsibility I couldn't handle, not anything that added value to my life in any way.

He moved back in with his mother 2 weeks later."
63,"&gt;he doesn't know what it was he just saw.  

Ell oh fuckin' ell."
64,"Your fiancé's parents have not acted like loving parents who deserve to attend your wedding. 

Six months ago there was a post in the subreddit raisedbynarcissists by a young woman who was very religious, and was concerned about going no contact with her abusive mother.  Her church advisors told the young woman that her mother had broken her duty to her daughter by her abusive treatment.  They told her it was OK to go ""no contact"" with her mother - that she should release her mother to God, so that He could work on her.  

I think that before you get married you need to go to a lawyer who is an expert in financial matters.  Draw up an ironclad combination of wills, trusts, and a prenup so that these abusive people will never see a red cent of your money.  Make it so that she won't be able to give them large sums of money if you predecease her.

Only then should you marry.  You could elope to someplace really wonderful, like Tahiti, and avoid the whole invitation thing.  If you want to have a traditional wedding, you need to use a venue that will enable you to hire security.

One of my friends went to a beautiful wedding on someone's estate, and security checked people's invitations at the gate.  That would be ideal for you - it is not hard to imagine these people ruining your wedding out of spite."

My ex abused me to the extreme, like would grab me by the hair and throw me on the ground *right in front of other people.* They all looked extremely uncomfortable, but no one ever did shit because it was ""none of their business."" People will ignore anything if it means that they save themselves some hassle. "
70,"Amicable or not, considering you seem to have been the main caretaker of the cat, I'd say definitely do all you can to keep it.  She is pretty young, if you do go legally she will probably back off from inexperience on her options.  She will hate you for it, but if you love the animal, don't subject it to living in a house with 3 other cats and 2 big dogs that could possibly harm it.  It will not have a good life like that.

If you have the vet bills as well keep them along with your registration to have everything you need to prove ownership.  9 months is nothing compared to a cats lifespan, you have an opportunity to give the cat a good life, so many have terrible lives...  I'd say go for it as soon as you can and let her know after the fact that you legally have ownership of the cat.  

She broke up with you, not the other way around."

This is completely inexcusable. Tell your sister, tell the cops, then dump his ass on the side of the road where it belongs."
73,the fact that she also stays completely silent about it??
74,"I think you both make valid points. The expectation that moms participate in every activity their children do *is* unreasonable, and it isn't necessary that you and your husband take part in all the same activities with your kids. I agree with you there. 

That said, ten is PLENTY old enough to remember the time that Mom didn't show up to an important event that you worked hard to achieve and feel really badly about it. I get that you don't enjoy sports or hot weather. I don't, either. But maybe this once you can suck it up and go support your son. "
75,"you're within your rights to keep the picture, and no, she doesn't have a case with the police.  they'd have to be pretty bored to even entertain the call.  chances are she 'wants' the picture only to prolong the breakup and your contact with her, as well as annoy you enough to continue engaging with her.

that said, is the picture so awesome as to be worth this drama?  i have a hard time believing it is.

were it me, i'd be trying to decide between two things:

giving the picture back and blocking her on everything (this is what i'd personally do, btw, to take the wind completely out of her sails)

or

keeping the picture and... blocking her on everything.  and in the extremely unlikely event the cops show up:  ""it was a gift.""  ""ma'am, do you have proof this wasn't a gift?""  ""no.""  ""then i guess you can take him to small claims.  c'mon, joe, let's get a cup of coffee, fuck this nonsense.""

personally, i wouldn't find a picture i could go out and take myself and print somewhere for $30 worth this crazy chick's nonsense, but that's me.  your mileage may vary.  either way, the point is, she's only using this picture to prolong things/annoy you.  were i you, i'd not buy into it.  and the best way to not buy into it is to either tell her you'll see her in court and block her, or just give it back (and block her) and laugh when you catch wind of her reporting to her friends that ""CAN YOU BELIEVE IT HE GAVE MY GIFT BACK IN MY BOX OF STUFF.""

she's playing baby games here.  rise above.  if you're inclined to play along, you might consider that you're getting something out of this silly drama, as well."
76,He hasn't seemed to realize it yet. He's only texted me once since yesterday that he would contact his friends on the weekend. He hasn't apologized at all. 
77,"That is how I felt too. I think some of it is anger at myself for not supporting my husband in the first place. I all but engineered the entire thing. I dismissed his concerns. Because of that, I created a situation where he was stalked and now we can't see people we miss greatly. All because I didn't just let him follow his gut.

Maybe, when I say I hate her, I actually hate myself. God, I hope not."
78,"Stop trying for a baby, firstly. "
79,"Given what you have survived, I have *no* doubt you will make this work with a little communication.

&gt;How should i go about making sure we can live comfortably or at least in peace?

This is your dad's job.  Talk to him.  Go in depth.  Express your concerns.  You aren't a ""burden"" you are a gift.

&gt;i think some of my brothers slightly hate me? Like me older brother(19m) wants nothing to do with me and is very curt. My twin was slightly excited to meet me but with all the issues I've been having (mentally) i think he was disappointed. 

Teenage years are tough.  My guess is they feel awkward and unsure of how to act around you given your traumatic past.  Doesn't seem to me based on what you've written that they ""hate"" or ""resent"" you - it's just an adjustment. Talk to your dad about arranging some fun, lighthearted family activities.  Express some interest in rugby and ask them about school - what teachers are bad, what kids are nice, etc.

&gt;I feel like im slightly impeding in their family

You *are* their family now. 
"
80,"&gt; It's over now

Smart man."
81,"lol do you throw away all of your 15+ year relationships over stuff like this?  I agree she was acting awful, but as a friend of 15 FUCKING YEARS wouldn't you want to put a little more effort into finding out what is going on??  Wtf is with this sub.  Maybe it's just the meta to recommend ghosting people?"
82,"Yes, a normal person would have been like ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I never meant to scare her"" etc etc. Your gf is batshit."
83,I know. At the very least I know he edited it and left it on his phone.  He said he was so drunk he forgot about it and now he wants to stop his drinking. Obviously I know that's not an excuse. I think I just needed to hear people say it to me instead of just sitting here saying it to myself.
84,"Sign it and then be really good about hiding what you do. Also, if he's a redditor, take this post down, because he will probably find it. "
85,"CPS for the brother, and please report the abuse of the dog as well. And don't let them near your baby.  :("
86,"He's a lazy asshole. Why are you dating a lazy asshole? One year and no job? How hard is he really looking? Are they advertizing jobs on tv? That's why he watches so much? If the only found a job selling cars in one year, then he should be selling the mother fucking cars! Not only that, but he is not even taking care of the house while you work? What is his excuse? Why are you enabling this? And to top it all, he's angry you wake up early to go work?? Fuck I'm angry for you. How long are you gonna put up with this lazy bum? Good luck raising kids with him."
87,"I'll give you an alternative.  When the flagship displays the signal flags B and Z (called Bravo Zulu in the Navy)  It stands for ""well done"" an high compliment.  Use Beezy to stand for that and it get rid of the demon connotation."
88,"*I don't think I'll ever find anyone better than that, and it will kill me when she finds somebody better than me.*

Um, no. With her racist views she's going to ultimately end up with someone who also believes in the superiority of whites. Definitely not better than you at all. I know right now it feels like you'll never find someone better, but you will. Give yourself time to grieve and let your emotions settle. And just remember,  had you stayed with your ex, it would have been your little sister writing here eventually asking for advice on how to handle her racist sil and her brother who refuses to defend her."
89,My husband spilled some red wine on my third favorite rug. Does anyone know a good divorce attorney? - OP
90,You're enabling her. She's damn near 30 and still living off of you and your husband.  She's quit a lucrative career to pursue a hobby that you're footing the bill for.  She should be grateful that she has supportive parents.  But if she's going to be nasty then maybe you should cut her off financially.
91,"&gt; He's everything I ever wanted in a partner

You want someone who cheats on you as a partner?
Odd."
92,I imagine a lot of gay kids with parents who did what you did dream at night about their parents doing a 180 like you've just done. I hope your relationship with your son continues to improve. 
93,even if i takes 5 hours to clean the lazy fuck doesnt have a job.
94,"&gt; We talked about a solution and he thinks I need to go back to my home country by myself for a few weeks and be with my family, and to leave him alone for that time so that he can think and mourn alone. **He also said that he is thinking about moving out of our flat at the end of the summer, to go live with some friends, but he said that he wants us to stay together.**

&gt; I think at this point that the relationship might be over

He's grieving and upset, but if you go forth with his ""solution"" OP then yes relationship is certainly over.

He's taking out his pain on you. That's what this is. He isn't thinking logically and it's easier for him to focus his anger/hurt on you *missing* the funeral (not being there in his time of need) rather than come to terms with the painful loss. He would STILL be hurting massively even had you gone to the funeral, because the woman he loves deeply and raised him is gone. However, right now you being M.I.A. is a lightening rod to channel his hurt feelings.

When you live together, moving out to live with friends is a HUGE downgrade that few relationships survive. He needs counseling, someone impartial to help him see what he's doing and that blaming you for upholding your educational duties is misplaced anger. There was nothing you could do -- postponing graduating for a YEAR to make a funeral doesn't make sense and it's likely not what his Grandmother would have wanted either!"
95,"Yes, this.

Do the holiday as planned this year and next year do a joint family holiday with everyone. It's time to start getting to know the sisters new family as a family. 

Probably wasn't the best idea to assume the holiday would happen as usual this year but since this has been the norm I'll give OP a pass. Equally the new husband can't expect a short notice big change like adding that many more kids but it is time to review plans so that the step sibs are involved together."
96,[removed]
97,It would be such a pity if anything was to.. happen.. to any of you.
98,"A male nurse? I'm shocked that ANY medical professional would spout this bullshit, let alone about his or her own child. (Sorry for yelling, I'm on mobile and don't know how to strikethrough/FTFY.)"
99,"&gt; I think you should have MORE contact with your mom and much lower contact with your dad. Frankly, your mom's affair was between her and your dad, and she has acted completely appropriately in the aftermath. 

I really agree with this, actually. OP has a right to feel hurt that her mom's affair destroyed her family and she has a right to establish her own boundaries with her mother going forward. That being said, OP should try to focus on the hurt that her mother caused her, herself. Not her father. She should not carry the burden of her father's hurt for the rest of her life. She's allowed to forgive her mom. "
100,[deleted]
101,"&gt;I don't want him to bear this crushing news while in prison

He isn't in jail for a minor drug infraction or tax evasion. He was arrested for *child pornography*. He should have known that as soon as the police broke down the door and told you why they were arresting him, there was no way you would stay married to him. 

He lied to you. He was committing a crime under your nose all these years. He even put you in danger (what if the police believed you *did* know about the CP?). He might be crushed to receive divorce papers in prison, but he absolutely shouldn't be surprised.  You really don't need to explain yourself. 

EDIT: a word."
102,"OP is so stupid I am laughing. She should have tried to explain to her brother (or tell him to stop), instead she told his BF to run away LOL Talk to your family more girl!"
103,"He invited them to steal from me. They cut the patches off with a pocket knife and left holes in my bag. 

My main effort is going to be getting my dad's patches back. I can get over the rest of them. But I really want those 4."
104,"&gt; she's very hyperactive and is on the go 24/7. Even with strict discipline she is very stubborn and causes a lot of trouble

... so she's 1?"
105,"Agreed - I've been out of work for three months and I keep to the same sleep schedule as my husband and do all the chores so that when he gets home he doesn't have to lift a finger and we can enjoy our time together. I'm busy all day with errands, laundry, cleaning, cooking and freelance work, and if I get any down time I'll bake or do something extra like whiten his shirts or whatever. I'm incredibly grateful to him for supporting me through this and doing the chores is a way to say thank you. 

OP, you deserve better. Me and the commenter above aren't saints, we're just normal human beings in loving relationships. Sounds to me like your boyfriend is depressed about being out of work. Having a schedule including chores will help him."
106,"""Yes, when I was 17, an older man took advantage of me. I'd prefer not to talk about it."""
107,"This is very good advice, and I hope you pay attention to it.

SHE IS STILL BULLYING YOU. You do not have to forgive her.  Do NOT have sex with a bully; it's just setting yourself up for no end of awful behavior.

Here's what you do: you continue to be polite but distant.  When she brings this stuff up, you should have some prepared phrases ready to go, and just keep repeating them. Miss Manners recommends this tactic to politely get someone to leave you alone, as eventually a broken record causes people to give up. ""As I have told you many times, Ashley, I'm under no obligation to do anything for you."" ""I don't see a point in discussing this any further, Ashley; my mind is made up."" Figure out your phrase and just use it each and every time she brings it up; keep repeating it like a broken record.

"
108,"That's what I thought. Seeing him call her a girl in the title I was like ""Oh this must be a non-romantic / non-sexual relationship.

Nope, he's just happy to be fucking someone he sees as a ""girl"""
109,"I don't think you need a lawyer for this. Her marrying for a green card may be a crime, but i dont see how this involves you. Did you find her the husband or take the money from her? Nope. You were not at the wedding, you have not seen the license, etc. for all you know, she might not even be married. Or, she IS married but in a real relationship with him, while you are the guy on the side. 

Breaking up is a great idea, but being the boyfriend of a newlywed is not a crime."
110,"I am so close and affectionate with my female friends that we are frequently mistaken for lesbian couples, and the things you describe are far over the line of mere friendship. You say if she was a man you wouldn't have let it go so far. I think you should dial it way back, because it seems your friendship has crossed an emotional line. "
111,"You should tell your husband to back off of your daughter and keep his mouth shut. 

I'll never understand why parents put their spouses first. My dad does that shit with my step mom and I *hate* it. There is literally no other way to make a kid feel any less wanted than to not step in and defend them when their new spouse starts shit talking."
112,"Yeahhhh the ways he's expressing his concerns are pretty sexist. I think any conversation needs to start with OP making clear that calling her vapid or a bridezilla for having, like, bookmarks on the internet, is some shit that will not fly. Even if he's genuinely concerned that she's getting carried away, belittling her intelligence is still a really disrespectful way to address it. "
113,"I get that your wife pulled a real bullshit move. But damn OP... 

I wouldn't be surprised if she left because she wanted you to 'wake up' and start realizing that you need to start putting serious effort into the relationship or risk losing it. 

Unfortunately, your wife's plan backfired hard. 

OP, do you care about your wife or family? 

Most people would be heartbroken in this situation. Lost. Not you. You jumped back into the dating life in a... Month? Most people would need time to pick up the pieces. Or maybe have a few one night stands. Not you. You shrug and move on to live a new life. 

I have to say I'm kind of appalled. What about your kids? Do you care about them? 

&gt;I continued on with my life, still maintaining occasional contact with my kids

Uhm, shouldn't you have been starting preparations for getting custody? A couple of Skype calls shouldn't be acceptable to you. Just how much do you care? Not enough. 

Your wife may have been awful, but I suspect your non-caring response to it is a reflection of how you behave in the marriage."
114,Thanks. I'm just gonna say this. 
115,"Jesus tapdancing christ...I couldn't even make it halfway through.

Why are you even with someone you treats you like this? There's no way you can get married until and unless you and sort this out.

He's being pushy, demanding, demeaning, and all around like he is severely constipated. 

Seriously put the brakes on this whole thing."
116,"Dude, making it right is going to be a life long process, not something that you do right before you leave. So you can start by having a conversation with them and asking what you can do to improve their lot in life. 

"
117,"But he ""totally wasn't going to go through with it""

My eyes rolled so hard they're spinning."
118,"Yup, this. The only things ""un-grandfathering"" Noah would accomplish would be 

a) hurting Noah, OPs mom, and their relationship with OP &amp; husband, and 

b) depriving a child of a grandparent

Which of these things are worth his mental satisfaction from propping his own father up?"
119,"Damage Control time.


Make it up to him, and pull out all the stops. This means taking him to his favorite restaurant, doing one of his favorite activities together, getting him a great gift. Just make him feel like it's no reflection on him that you forgot.


As another commenter said, ""make it a point to be there for him more going forward"".


I think you should tell your parents. Even if whatever they do isn't out of genuine care at their son being upset, it would be better than them not realizing and making up for it at all."

121,"Wow, you really show your true colors in that fourth paragraph.  I feel for your ex and I bet we're not getting the entire story."
122,There's only two other people that have keys to our house and it's her mom and grandmother. I actually did purchase a nanny cam last night and am going to install it when it arrives.
123,"I think you need to think about why she is crying.

It's not that what you said is an unkind lie.  It was the honest truth and truth can hurt the most.  She's facing the consequences of her situation - that the dating pool will be a lot smaller for her now as she needs to find a guy who does want to raise someone else's kid.  I'd be sad too.  It's not insurmountable, but her life will be harder now and disappointment from you will not be the last time she feels this disappointment.

It's gotta sting knowing you are good enough for sex, but that some will reject a relationship with you due to you kid. It's reality and reality SUCKS sometimes.

Probably even more so since you two already have history.  Most random guys will be even harder to get interested as they don't know her at all."
124,"Ultimatum time. ""Clean the fucking house, or pack your bags and get your lazy ass out of the house I am paying for""

This calls for plain speaking and an ultimatum you enforce. This is massively disrespectful and parasitic"
125,"&gt;""pregnancy, responsibility, diseases, assholes who don't care about you and just use you etc"" is a bit too much at this age I think

Your 11 year old is about at the age where she will start getting sex ed from the school.  I think it's absolutely an appropriate time to start talking about this stuff.  And maybe I'm old fashioned, but 12 years old is SUPER YOUNG to be having sex.  Like, TOO young.  

I agree that it might be problematic for your wife to be telling your daughters to never have sex unless they're in love or whatever.  I think that borders on shaming and I don't necessarily think girls should feel guilty for having sex with someone they're not necessarily in love with.

You two really need to sit down and talk to each other and get on the same page with regard to educating and preparing your daughters.  Just because you're the dad and just because you're not a pediatrician doesn't mean you don't get an equal say. 

also, I hope your wife knows that sending your daughters to an all-girl school will do absolutely nothing in deterring them from sex."
126,"Like, multiple people thinking you were trying is... Weird. And not even being like 'oh, I just assumed', but responding with outright confusion? He's telling people you were trying.

If he's telling people you were trying to get pregnant, I would be... Very cautious."
127,"&gt;  Sure, they're just lemons but there was company coming over and she was setting up and doing all the work in trying to create a nice dinner party. She cooked and cleaned and he didn't lift a finger or do the one thing she asked of him, which was typical behavior, and she lost it.

Very good example. I think a lot of people here are hung up on the ""It's like $30 worth of hot dogs, so what?"" aspect of this instead of the ""BF acted completely selfishly and keeps minimizing OP's feelings over it.""

If someone does something to upset me, the **last** fucking thing I want to hear from that person is ""It's not a big deal"". 

I think it matters if BF does things like this regularly (acts on impulse, doesn't think about the consequences, has no regard for OP) or if it was a one-time thing. "
128,"Right? ""Keep up appearances"" For who? You're letting in someone who thinks INCEST regularly happens in your family. I would go...and I would stand and make a speech when they ask ""does anyone object"" and I would read a prepared speech to show just how vile this woman is. "
129,"You didn't start divorce proceedings in two months...why would you assume it was over? You didn't fight to get your kids back. Its like you just wanted to walk away - except she walked away.
Of course she will see this as cheating - and she isn't wrong.
If you see this as over - start the divorce and end it."
130,"IIRC inherited assets, especially those inherited before marriage, remain separate property. That said since she wants to stay home a prenup will likely protect you much more than it will protect her, as you will be the one earning what goes into retirement accounts, you'll be the one who would have to pay alimony and you'll be the one paying child support. 

So clarifying now how to split all the money you saved while married and your future money is in *your* best interests, especially given your fear of divorce. 

Having or not having a prenup does not cause or prevent a divorce. What it does do is prevent being financially ruined if a divorce does happen. "
131,"Yes.  Abusers blame their actions on their victims.  That's what he did here: he took a genuine, real (terrifying) concern you have, and turned it into a problem of you not respecting him enough.

This is like when someone hits their partner and then says ""You made me do it again!  Why can't you stop making me hit you!"""
132,"Your boyfriend would literally let someone keep something your dead father gave you than risk looking ""uncool"" in front of his friends. 

This guy is not a keeper."
133,"&gt; I don't want to contact IHSS and tell them my parents aren't making my living situation a safe environment

It's this, or maintain the status quo. Those are your options, because your parents aren't going to magically change all of a sudden. 

Also, if your brother is legitimately psychopathic it's nothing your parents have done. It's a mental illness like schizophrenia and bipolar, it's not a product of upbringing. If this is just you armchair diagnosing, try not to do that."
134,"This is a symptom of something much worse - he is being possessive of your body. Huge red flag, this would be a deal breaker for me. Im braless most days, wear low cut tops etc and my boyfriend only says I look great"

136,"I think you should be talking to the rest of your family to find out what they've been doing to your sister. 

They beat her for getting 80% in class? That's terrible. Where were you when this was going on? Do they buy you expensive gifts and leave her out?

And why does everyone feel entitled to touch her? She doesn't even have control over her own body? How far did this abuse go? We already know it was emotional and physical, was it sexual too?

I think you have to give her space or you're ignoring her wishes as her family has done over and over again. I think you should get into therapy yourself to find out how you contributed to this."

138,"If your house is big enough and you have the money for it, you can do what some Indian families do and partition your house so that your wife and you have your own private section of it. It's perfectly natural for your girlfriend to not want to be your dad's carer so reassure her that that won't be an issue and that you'll have someone looking after him even after she moves in."
139,It's a good skill to have and it sounds like you need practice.  
140,"Yeah, reading the title I was prepared to totally take his side... but then that really caught me off guard.  The fact that he was dating multiple women within two months of his wife walking out without even speaking once to talk about divorce - that shows bad judgment on his part and it really makes me question what else he's had bad judgment about.  Either way, these two people probably shouldn't be together.  Poor kids."
141,"He knows he's messy, he's just pretending he doesn't know.  If he notices your tiny messes, then he for sure notices his.  What he should actually say if he's being honest, is that he doesn't CARE about his own messes.

Sit down and talk to him.  Confirm that you don't mind doing more of the house work, but tell him that you don't appreciate him nagging you over your small messes when he doesn't care about his own.  Ask him direct questions: ""why does it bother you when I leave my clothes on the floor, but not when your own are on the floor?""  ""why do you mention my messes, but not your own?"" etc.  Tell him that you would appreciate it if he either picked up after himself more, or didn't criticize your cleaning habits since you're doing more of it."
142,"OP, you've posted comments all over this thread about how this dude whines for sex, doesn't respect your boundaries, and coerced you into doing things you didn't want to. Please just get out of the relationship. 

You need to be single right now. From your comments, you don't sound like you can stick up for yourself. You need to work on your self esteem and work on understanding how to set firm boundaries dude. Someone is going to seriously hurt you if this keeps up, probably this guy."
143,"First thing's first. Have you called the police yet? Call the police right now, while the bruise is still fresh. If your sister needs to pursue a restraining order, this will be a huge help later.

Second, your sister feels guilty that she urged you into a situation that ended with you getting punched. It's great that you don't blame her, but she does blame herself. Most people would feel terrible in that situation. Essentially, her bad choices hurt someone she loves, and that's a tough situation to be in. She will forgive herself soon."
144,Definitely make her pay child support
145,"Totally. The update is going to be something like ""yeah turns out my parents were furious because the twin I never knew I had was buried in the cellar and constantly haunting my parents for killing him"""
146,"Wow I missed that, you're right. Sneaky OP, brushing off details (why not tell her what's so urgent??) and making himself the victim.

Man, in this case, this whole thing is on OP and the chick's better off without him."
147,"&gt;   I haven't told her that, I've mostly just stuck to the feminism thing.

So you're full of shit and she knows.  

A main problem with your argument is that, while marriage as an institution may be founded in misogyny, you as individuals have the agency to negotiate more respectful and egalitarian boundaries in your union.

Your gf wants to make your relationship legit.  She's almost 30 now, and marriage is something she has come to value more.  If you can't marry her and don't trust her enough to not screw you over (yeah, read what you wrote again - you don't trust her), then just end it."
148,Excellent point and gracefully stated! I'll use this for sure. 
149,"Just want to say that just because you do volunteer work doesn't make you a good person. I've known a few horrible narcissists that get off on having a martyr complex from volunteering and making sacrifices. 

Not that I'm saying this is your bf. Just don't think that everyone that volunteers dies so because they have a good heart. 

Besides, this wedding might be bringing out your bf's true colors. "
150,if the genders were reversed...
151,"Why do you want to remain with a man who is this thoughtless and destructive. It is one thing to be drunk and stupid and quite another to not recognize how serious this was. He lacks accountability. He should be horrified and offer to pay medical bills, offer an apology, and stop drinking. It could have been much worse than a concussion."
152,"This was the deal with my narcissist mother, me, and my name too. My legal name is AWFUL. Think a SPESHUL speeling of a common name, like Khrystahl for Crystal, or Jessyka for Jessica. ALWAYS mangled. I've hated it as long as I can remember because it looks like its said ""Chris-stall"" or ""Je-see-ka"" when really it's supposed to be said just like Crystal or Jessica.

So I informally changed it kinda by serendipity. 

I couldn't be called my preferred name because basically, I was defacing Nmoms property. My name wasn't mine, I wasn't mine. 

And nothing I ever did was right. Just like in your situation. If I didn't clean my room, that was wrong. If I cleaned it, I did it wrong. If I cleaned it the way I was told, I did it at the wrong time. 

You can't ever win with a narcissist. Never. But that's the issue here, you have to find a way to win, because you need to be the stable, safe adult for Beezy. I feel for you. :-/"
153,"Okay, here's the thing: some people are attracted to things that other people find unattractive. 

I'm definitely one of them. One of my most cherished relationships was with a girl who my friends compared to a caricature of a witch. She had a large nose with a crook in it, a big chin, a slightly lazy eye, super short black curly hair, and not much to speak of in the breast department. And yet to me she was one of the sexiest women I have ever dated and if she wasn't married today I would jump at the chance to see her again. 

I've dated tall leggy American blondes with huge breasts, petite Asian women that neckbeards would kill for and German fashion models - but when I'm fantasizing about which of my previous girlfriends I'd want to be with again, that witch girl is number one.

Stop being so down on yourself and maybe give the guy a chance. As long as you don't suspect he's trying to fuck with your head for shits and giggles, he may actually be really into you."
154,She says he didn't want me around because it would be difficult with his own kids but since my sister was younger he imagined that it would not be as much of a problem. She said the reason for divorce is that they no longer feel like they can be life partners. Nothing specific.
155,"OP, I recently lived with someone who abused their child. It's real. This is abuse and controlling behavior and it's a fucking vortex.  Don't engage. Don't prod. Ignore and contact the landlord about moving out. Or just put on headphones and pretend you're in a silent movie with her. That's what I did.

Edit: Woah peeps...totally reported that shit when she started breeding rabbits in her room. This was literally like last week...situational irony too cause I just happened to do it on red nose day. I actually want to do a meta ppost for /r/relationships because this woman was too god damn much. But I'm also going to use her crazy as character source material for a book im writing. 

Edit2: Anyone who's going to judge me for handling the situation the way I did has clearly never been in a place/time where their entire life is at risk. Reporting/Getting involved while in the state would have ended up with a bullet in my head. So...fuck off :D"
156,"At first I was shocked because it seemed totally out of character for him (there's times where students and some faculty members have attended social outings together and he's adamant about not going) but based on the responses here, I think he was just trying to be respectful of our professional relationship instead of jeopardizing it with his own desires. I can respect that. 

EDIT: a word. "
157,"This.

She doesn't sound like someone I would want around in my life. She'll probably wiggle her way into this trip one way or another but don't give her the details on your flight home so you can have a peaceful flight and not deal with her."
158,"Don't do this.  Don't try to understand it.

It cannot be understood.

She's a flawed person, and she cheated and then kept lying to everyone about it.

You'll love again.  And you'll be thankful that you found out about all this before you were married and had kids.

Hang in there.  Stop worrying about her.

Grieve for the loss of the future you thought you had, but hold hope for the brighter one you will have once you are past this."
159,"As they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
160,"Maybe, but it gets the point across. Another response in this vein could be: ""Yes, now that you mention it. Having the same conversation about my lunch every day IS boring. Read any good books lately?"" "
161,I see divorce in your future. You gave her an ultimatum; let's be real here. 
162,"There's always the chance that she won't believe me. I do think the other women who witnessed the other behavior could provide insight, though. 

Dave and Katie's interactions definitely seemed like more than friends, I agree. "
163,"These are way past borderline offensive- even if I am blisteringly angry with my SO, I would never write these things about them. Even if we're fighting, I will never say things to personally attack them because you should never want to attack them and bring them down. Maybe I'm an anomaly but why would I want to write down that negative energy about the person I love? I wouldn't, so it surprises me when people bash their SO's in their journals. I don't get it. I don't blame you for beginning to read them, as there's no reason why he should've kept them- why did he keep them when they have blatantly rude and awful things written about you on them? Especially now that you're married?

I would definitely sit him down and talk to him about this. Ask for an explanation as to why he wrote them when some of them are just mean- he hates the way you laugh? He doesn't like how close you are to your parents? (Shouldn't this be a good thing?) He thinks you should shove the litter up your ass after you asked him to clean the litterbox? Seriously? What an asshole. He better have a good explanation for writing this crap, its so disrespectful.

If there was something bothering him about you, sit down like adults and talk about to work towards a solution- don't write them down in a ""Burn Book"" as if you're in high school. I know this is one of those classic passive-aggressive writing an angry letter and not sending it things but nothing gets solved that way. You just end up with a piece of paper covered in awful things about the person you're supposed to love."
164,"Lucy is responsible for her own coursework, period.  If she'd put as much effort into actually doing her own damn work as she did into trying to get other people to ~~do it for her~~ ""help"", she wouldn't be in this mess.  Also, asking Michael ""in front of other people so he won't say no"" *is* completely manipulative, regardless of Michael's other behavior.  Sam, however unintentionally, set this whole mess up by suggesting that.  I think Sam needs to learn that this is the outcome when you try to strong-arm people you know aren't willing.  

As for Michael, while I get that you have concerns about him, I don't really think this is the right situation to drop the hammer.  I do think it's worth having a talk with him about how this kind of behavior plays in the adult world -- if you pull this kind of sabotage in the working world, even if the other person *totally deserves it,* you risk damaging your own reputation as much as the other person.  But beyond that, honestly, Michael sounds like he was pushed into a corner and it's not totally fair to punish him for reacting."
165,Pfft. She doesn't have to buy him shit. Link him to the fleshlight Web page and say adios.
166,"They might react to ""are you flirting with me?"" with a quick ""no way!!"" just to save some face. (Schrödinger's flirter, it's only flirting if you react positively to it.)

If they do react like that, you should follow up with a cheerful ""awesome! I was hoping that wasn't the case, that saves me the trouble of having to reject you! Haha."" 

If anyone jokes about ""oohhhh, friendzoned!"" just respond ""yup!"" and don't explain or defend yourself. The correct answer to ""wow, how mean of you to friendzone me"" is always going to be ""so you don't want to be my friend anymore? Okay. Consider it done."""
167,"Yeah I'm confused who says ""I need to go it's urgent"" to an 8 year partner???"
168,"Sounds like he doesnt respect you or your career choice, huge red flag."
169,"Abuser textbook basics. It's always your fault. He threatens to smash a stool into your face, but you made him do it. On what earth could you have possibly made him do it? Did you have a gun to his head forcing him to threaten you? 

I'm not kidding, pack, go. "
170,Privacy setting please. My dad thinks I only used Facebook twice this year. 
171,People without siblings live on the same planet as everyone else. We understand that incest isn't a normal thing to be assumed about others. 
172,"I mean, I've definitely been around people who make little jokes like this. Small jabs at things that people can't afford. It's still remarkably dickish and annoying but they keep it within the friend group. As assholish as that behaviour is, it's a whole new level to *ESCALATE THE FUCKING JOKE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE RESTAURANT AND RISK CRIMINAL ACTION ON THEIR PART.* That's sincerely sociopathic shit right there. These ""friends"" are nothing but bad news and have exactly zero empathy for other human beings, you are their plaything and will use you for whatever cheap laughs they can squeeze out of you. Get out."
173,"When you told her no did you tell her your situation and why you feel it's too soon? I personally think 6 months is way too soon to get married especially because you guys still might be in the honeymoon phase of your relationship. 
If you haven't already, you guys should get together and talk about it, explain your situation and make sure to comfort her as well. Imagine if she had told you no and how you would feel. You can tell her you do see a future with her and plan on getting married but just not now. (If you feel that way of course) "
174,"Why is your mother not sorting this out?

You're a kid, and you're paying rent and child-minding for two adults that can't get their shit together?"
175,Bottom line is he and they stole from you. I'm really confused why he or any of your friends are perfectly fine with that.  I'd play nice until you get as many patches as possible back then dump him like the piece of shit he is.
176,"I'm very much a lurker...but this stood out tremendously to me. Your children live with you and you see them and interact with them all day everyday to going to speaking to them (3 kids!) 2 to 3 times a week?? So was he just getting them all on the phone at once to check in??

Who knows what was going on with their marriage, but he clearly felt they were in a normal (perhaps strained) marriage because he was so blindsided by her leaving etc., so how did he start dating so quickly? And clearly didn't tell his date the situation since she was shocked at the sight of his wife. 

Also, where did he expect his children to live permanently? His wife and him may separate sure, but he seemed completely content with only speaking to his kids a few times a week as they lived with his SIL. I too am left with more questions than answers..."
177,"Hi, Russian-Jewish atheist who married a Serbian-Orthodox Christian in dual (one-following-the-other) ceremony here. Here is how I approached my more religious relatives about it. I explained that we would be raising our children in both faiths (and we are) and that of course the marriage is (as both religious ceremonies really are) centered around raising our children in the faith. If they can't support the marriage, they can't support the resulting children and their moral upbringing in the Jewish faith. I stressed how I would hate to have to not invite them to the briss celebration or the bar/bat mitzvahs, how sad it would be for the kids to not visit them when they go on Birthright, etc.  I stressed that it would be a shame that such a wealth of religious instruction they could provide would be closed off to my children especially when they do start to decide which religion speaks true to them as they grow older.  But, surely, if they chose to publicly disapprove of my wedding and question the vowes in the ketubah we signed, then they cannot expect to be relied upon to help us fulfill those vowes.  Then I begged them not to start the exclusion wars because I love them and I love my faith (ethnically and traditionally speaking). All showed up. "
178,"""I was a teenager, he was twice my age, and married with children, as well as my boss. He had the balance of power and chose to pursue me regardless. I have no intention of addressing it further."" 

I come from a small town, people will talk - but there's been 1000 juicy tidbits to gossip about in the meantime. If you address it in this way, and engage in no further discussion, I think they'll fall back to all those other gossip topics pretty quickly."
179,"That is the first thing I am doing, I just got back to my place with my nephew. 

First thing I am doing in the morning is going to an attorney and filing for guardianship and I told my sister this. She said she is going to be completely cooperative through the process  "
180,"Speaking as a former 23-year-old busty virgin, these sorts of people aren't uncommon. Everybody thinks that having big boobs makes you a sex object, but most have the tact to not say it. Your brother's fiancé is way out of line, and there's no way I'd go to that wedding. 

Think about it, unless your sister wears a thick sweater, the fiancé will probably call whatever she wears ""inappropriate"" simply because the shape of large breasts is considered sexy by most people. And not attending sends a clear message to your brother that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated. "
181,[removed]
182,"I think you need to spend some time being extra considerate of his needs, even if he won't voice them and that means having the discipline to really analyze yourself. I'm glad you were able to open up communication and hopefully it stays open so resentment doesn't build up and you are able to rebuild his trust. Figuring out yourself is important, but so is being a partner to your husband. "
183,Can you ask the officers you spoke to if they would bring it up with her?  This is so out of nowhere for her that I wouldn't be surprised if needing to take that action hasn't occurred to her.  And she is absolutely still in danger from Sasha.
184,"In the OP he just said ""it's urgent"". "
185,"Does he still see his therapist? You could go with him and tell him there where you will both have the support you need to make sure he understands that this just happens sometimes. It's incredibly common, and just nature doing what it needs to do.

For what it's worth, I had a miscarriage for a pregnancy I didn't even want and I was pretty broken up about it. It's ok to grieve. But it's better to share it with someone so you can heal better and move forwards."
186,Why is that terrifying? You're ALREADY raising your kid alone. YOUR HUSBAND HAS NO JOB BUT YOUR CHILD IS IN DAYCARE ANYWAY. 
187,"Ask for the money back. Doesnt hurt to ask. Dont ask, dont get. You only spent this money because of him, he kinda owes you, hopefully he'll see it that way

Or: Take the flights anyway, and book a cheap hotel somewhere else, have a mini-break you've largely paid for already. The flight is the big expense.

Bon voyage!"
188,"I know that you love your mother, but she doesn't get to make the decision about if you call the police or not. This has stopped being about her- you have your little brother to think about, and that's more important than what she wants.

There's a lot of information out there about leaving abusive relationships, and getting away from abusive parents is similar. You need to be so incredibly careful about how you do this. Are you using a computer at home to post this? If so, you need to go through your history and delete all evidence of coming here for help now. Abusers are most dangerous when you're planning to leave.

Talk to a women's shelter. Ask them what you need and what you can do. Ask them what happens if you call the police and your mom claims that she fell down the stairs and refuses to say anything different. 

ETA: be sure to consider the role CPS could play in this, too. childhelp.org might be a resource for you."
189,"Honestly, I have been in the same situation. A guy I worked with would tickle me, poke my sides, and even went as far as to ""admire my belt buckle"" by touching it. I asked him to stop many times. It didn't help. He cornered me one day threatening to tickle me. I told him not to touch me. The closer he got, the louder I got, until he heard someone coming and backed off.

I went to HR.

We was fired shortly after that.

Turns out I wasn't the first person to go to HR about him. "
190,"If you don't think you can handle this, then now would be the time to bail.

At least you acknowledge the responsibility of all parties in this, but your husband finishing inside his friend was an astronomically idiotic thing to do, I take it there was no mention of the Plan B pill afterward?

If you feel like ending it is the right thing to do, then do it before you have kids."
191,"But I'm saying, WHO DOES THAT? Who offers and who the hell accepts, and thinks it's okay to just cut into someone's bag like that?!"
192,"For your own daughter's sake, I think you need to sit down SIL and tell her frankly that you will not be able to babysit her daughter if you have your daughter with you. Her choice of parenting method sends confusing messages to your daughter, who does not understand why she is the only one that has to follow the rules. Your niece has also hit your daughter and has been aggressive towards her. If you are not allowed to discipline your niece when she acts up, then you cannot babysit. 

And just leave it at that. I don't think you are going to get a good response if you tell your SIL that you think her parenting methods are terrible. But this may send enough of a message to rethink things. "
193,Keep it secret. Keep it safe.
194,"This is incredibly worrisome!! /u/Punchdrunklady change ALL your passwords **immediately**!

Based on her behavior, Lisa is not someone I'd want to associate with, in the future."
196,"Definitely. I'm not an expert but I think you may even be able to get some thin, soft foam products to layer under the area rugs. Bonus is that they will be easier on your newbie as s/he crawls and learns to walk :)

I think your neighbor is overreacting and frankly not being very neighborly -- noise like this is a normal part of living in an apartment and it's not like you're playing the drums at 4am -- but in the interest of keeping the peace I would either talk to her or leave her a note and say you completely understand her complaints, and you are looking into soundproofing products, project to be completed within 1-2 weeks (or whatever is a realistic timeline for you)."
197,So he cheats on you and demands you become his mother.. why are you with him? Are these the values you want your kids to learn?
198,"Be cold and polite but do not engage.  Say ""she had me jumped and I want nothing to do with her"" if anyone asks. Do not give her any of your time or attention. You don't need to be her friend to be a part of the group. Watch out for her spreading some shit or creating some drama to force your hand. It doesn't sound like she's changed much to be honest.

And just to be clear - DO NOT fuck her. "
199,"Many people are saying it is just venting, and maybe so. But I do not think I would be able to stay with someone after reading all of the things they hate about me, 5+ years' worth. My boyfriend agrees. Dealing with why he feels that why and why he has to write it down is one thing, but *you* also need to be reaffirmed that he loves you. It is not all about finding out why he feels that way, but also how you can move on from reading his ""hate-venting-journel.""

I think that you should bring it up, and maybe go to couples' counseling -- for *both* of you. He needs to learn how to express his anger in a way that you can actually reduce whatever is stressing him out so much -- some of which are very easy to fix like not making that same recipe when he either is ""absolutely disgusted by"" or smiles when you say it's for dinner...? Because you need to know which one is the truth. And also -- you need therapy because to be a productive partner in this marriage you need reassurance you are loved and valued and not just secretly hated.

Best of luck to both of you."
200,"I don't want to shit on your answer, but ""reassure her you still want to be with her"" is a small scratch on the surface of the problem.

It's one thing to just say ""Well sweetie it's just biology! I'm so attracted to you."" and another thing for your dick to ""prove"" (in her mind) that you're not attracted to her.

It's going to be a very long and difficult road to try to verbally convince her while your dick is betraying you and (again, in her mind), ""proving"" that what you're saying isn't true.

It's going to take a lot of talking, a lot of effort in trying to figure out your medical issue as well. You should consider the thought that it's not just a family doctor you should be seeing, but also maybe a therapist (even if you don't really need long talking sessions, it would be nice to even have 1 session where you see if you can pinpoint the origin). I don't know shit about being a doctor so maybe it's just physical, I dunno, but you should take every route open to you in solving this.

It's going to take time for her to get over it, and it's going to be made even more difficult every time you guys try to have sex and it doesn't go smoothly. Spend time with her, talk to her about it, talk to your psychiatrist about it, talk again to your doctor about it?"
201,It's so adorable that I want to vomit. Congrats OP. 
202,"Yeah, I was hoping there was a nice way I could suggest it as I see her daughter's behavior steadily getting worse to the point of being intolerable, and I don't think anyone else is going to say anything (her husband is super uninvolved in childrearing) but I can see how it would go over badly."
203,"Oh, and you asking for no alcohol and him replying your parents can just stay away?  NO.  That is so rude and disrespectful I'd call a halt to everything just for that."
204,"Your brother really upsets me.

&gt;And he turned to me and said ""I'm very disappointed in you, I thought you were more mature than this.""

He turned to YOU and said this?!  He should have said it to his fiance!  Not only would I definitely not attend his wedding, I would try and convince your parents not to attend either.

""Mom, Dad, future SIL is going to tear our family apart.  She is openly disrespectful to both sister and I, and is going to cause a rift between all of us.  We do not support this marriage, and hope you realize how toxic this environment will become""

Maybe  once ALL your family members tell your brother how awful his fiance is, He'll start to realize it"
205,"Up through the depths! About six feet high! Breathing beer! His chest full of sighs! Groomzilla!

Seriously, OP, are you allowed to have _any_ input into your own damn wedding?  If I were you, I'd put my foot down. No, he can't choose your dress. No, there will be no alcohol, or there will be no wedding; this wedding is _not_ about what he can make his family do for him, it's about joining your family to his, and if he's making it so that your family can't come when they  haven't been abusive to him, that's a non-starter.

I'd really recommend putting ALL the planning on hold until you can get to a couple's therapist."
206,"Serious question, how do you see a longterm future with this guy? You're not in this together, you are the breadwinner and the maid."
207,"And you know for the rest of that little kid's youth, he will hear about the time he knocked over the cupcakes at aunt so-and-so's wedding and isn't that cute

209,"So, you haven't even made an effective case for yourself to internet strangers. You told us how great the location your parents picked is, but you told us nothing about your own plan. Only a vague ""I'd like independence"". You don't convey a sense to me that you've done a lot of soul searching, or that you even can codify your reasons. So I have to wonder how you sound when you try to explain your side to your friends and family.

Turning down a windfall like this is kind of crazy just so you can live life in hard mode. Struggling to make your way, paying rent in an expensive market, is not glamorous at all. Don't do it just to do it. Take your extra money and get time to focus on developing yourself, your hobbies, your relationships. But if you have a reason for distancing yourself from your parents that's a different story. Does the flat come with very invasive strings attached, for example? Is your older brother absolutely insufferable?

So hit me with your best shot. Why do you feel doing it on your own is in your own best interests?"
210,"He's not just dramatic; he's manipulative. If you don't want to go no contact, I would ignore him when he's having his fits and only respond when he's being polite. That said, you don't owe him this. 

He's being emotionally abusive, and you're not required to keep him in your life. If you're looking for kinship, you may want to check out r/raisedbynarcissists."
211,"Personally, as a male, I think you're being dramatic. I've never heard of anyone I know who has a vasectomy having any long term pain, though I realize that's purely anecdotal. I think you're copping out over what is actually a pretty minor risk if at all (and don't bother telling me to Google to surgeries like you did the other respondents, I know). 

The burden of prevention has been on her for years, she's carried 3 children for you and you're scared of a small statistic even your urologist believes is over inflated? Just don't try to blame anyone but yourself when your wife decides she doesn't want to have sex with you or decides to be the only one in the relationship willing to compromise and make some sacrifice while resentment begins to build up on her end. "
212,"Talk to your professor immediately, and they will advise you on who to talk to next. It's possible that, with the possibility of legal trouble for you, the professor may choose to ""act on an anonymous tip,"" kick her up the chain to disciplinary action, thereby getting her into trouble all by herself, and saving you from being exposed. After all, as long as what you did wasn't plagarism, a college disciplinary board won't be able to do anything to you. "

215,"**DO NOT APOLOGIZE, DO NOT ENGAGE HER IN ANYWAY**

Your child, your husband and your safety come first.  Engaging her in anyway puts her needs above those of your family.  You need to file a report with the police.  This woman needs help and she has the potential to be dangerous, very dangerous.   She also has the potential to fool you into thinking she's better.  This is a situation that you don't return from, ever.  

She pushed over the course of weeks to a mental break point, what you said was said out of fear, and anger caused by her unstable behavior."
216,"One question. If it's all innocent. WHY LIE? trust your gut. what is it telling you? Please go with your gut.

EDIT: by go with your gut I meant to say tell her goodbye. At your age you're ready to settle down. (Unless you don't want to). Do her actions fit with what you need? Say goodbye bro."
217,"I work with kids with autism and one of their big behaviors is inappropriate attention seeking. 

The way to curb this is to stop giving it attention. If she doesn't show up, go on without her. If she disappears, she's a big girl, she can take care of herself. If she doesn't answer your text/phonecall, don't send another one until she does. 

Its important that EVERYONE stops giving it attention though, which can be hard to navigate. Also, when attention seeking starts to stop working, often people will get whats called an 'extinction burst' -the behavior gets worse before it gets better. Its like when you stop answering that jackhole's texts and then suddenly he texts and calls you 4 times a second for 5 hours. 

Edit: important note, you are ignoring the *behavior*, not the person. If she appropriately asks for attention, reinforce the hell out of it. Give her sympathy and affection and whatever she's asking for, make it gushy. "
218,"Honestly, just be there on time lol. I always thought I wanted to be greeted with flowers and this big show of affection, but...flying really fucks you up. Get there on time, greet her sweetly, take her luggage and bags and load them into the car, and my god, bring her favorite snack or junk food to eat on the ride back and a bottle of water. You're sweet for asking! She's a lucky girl.

220,"I can't help thinking about what your brother said. In the first post you said he thought ""it was about time to become a family again"". 

I agree he is naive, but maybe he was inclined to get you back as a form of support for himself, and not for your mother's sake.

He has been through some shitty behaviour from your mom, although not as bad as you have, but imagine if you suddenly bumped in to your older sibling when you were still young and only ""had"" your mother. You're the only one he has beside his mother. It's naive but not weird to want an ally "

225,"Firstly, tell them it's damn well *not* ""our"" house. It's your house. They don't own it, they don't pay the bills, so they have zero input on whether you allow someone to live there.

Secondly, have you actually punished them for it at all? *Done* anything about it?"
226,"Wowww, what 'good friend' are you talking about here? This man has assaulted you, trapped you, and is displaying all kinds of really concerning, really terrible behavior! This guy is not your friend!

Look, I have social anxiety, and I understand the fear of letting people go. Especially when they seem so hard to come by. But believe me what I say, that this guy honestly sounds like he's waiting for things to escalate. And if you don't cut him out, things will escalate, and then it's not going to be 'funny' and 'a joke' any more. Locking you in a room for 10 minutes? I'd have called the police.

He's not showing you respect, nor treating you like an equal. Imagine if he did the stuff he did to a male friend, or anyone, regardless of anxiety. Would they keep him around? No way. Don't let yourself settle for jerks just because you're scared of being alone, that only keeps you from meeting good people who care about you."

Even if she hadn't been there, he was psycho enough to drive over and scream and smash shit just on the *chance* she was there. That becomes obvious when he saw her and it was enough of a surprise that he started threatening suicide. It was only a surprise because he didn't know for certain she was there. "

234,"You're going through JADE- Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain. 

Leaving is a process but now would be a good time to start this process.

Is he going to raise a chair and scream at your child when they're two and in the ""no"" phase?

You need to leave before this man hurts you. Emotionally, he already has. Physically, it's only a matter of time. "
235,"Op, have you not discussed limits? 

You dont have to be okay with it, specially since you aren't."
236,"Came here to say pretty much exactly this. When you've been dating someone for a while, it's pretty shitty to go out and hook up with someone right away, especially when the ""break up"" was during such an emotionally charged situation. 

But yes, you guys don't seem very compatible. "
237,"I had a stepgrandfather who passed away a few years ago.  Similar situation -- he didn't raise my dad, but he was in my dad's life before I was born, so he was my grandpa.  I still miss him and think about him a lot.  My grandma -- his wife -- died when I was very little, and his memories of her are one of the ways I was able to feel like I knew her.  

Not to feelingsbomb you, but I'm really, really glad my parents didn't have your husband's attitude.  "
238,"Is there a way to write a legal as possible letter without a lawyer? Our current lawyer, that we have been using for different reasons, charges $275 an hour. That's a little out of our price range for this."

240,"This is a mild form of ableism, OP. Love the armchair medical advice. Culturally, we allow for a huge amount of judgement based on people's eating habits and relationship toward food.

You need to come up with some scripts to shut people down when they start with this line of pressure. Here are some examples:

1. ""Yeah, that pizza does look good. But I cant eat it. Pass the salt, please.""

2. ""Everybody likes to think they're a doctor but they're not. Unless you can show me a medical degree with a specialization in nutrition and allergies my diet is not up for discussion.""

3. ""I'll eat what I want. You eat what you want. If my diet is such a problem for you, that's your issue, not mine.""

4. ""Yep, I can't eat whatever I want, whenever I want. Oh well. I love the paint color in here.""

5. ""My diet isn't up for negotiation, sorry."""
241,"For what it's worth, women's shelters in my city at least are just about always full so it's not quite as easy as just calling and moving in. 

Additionally those services exist because in the 70s, 80s and 90s survivors lobbied and organized and worked really hard against a system stacked against them. The organization I'm involved with (a domestic violence phone line) *is* working to make these services available to people of all genders, not just women. "

244,"She knows she's obese. She hates being obese. She hates herself. That's why she makes mean ""jokes"" towards other people. To project her own self loathing, to ease her own pain. I feel for her, but that does not excuse her. You didn't even make a revenge joke. You made a good point. She knows that point and she can't take it. 

I hope she learns that she can't dish out shit without getting some back.  And I hope your brother learns how to stop being blinded by love and defend his family."
245,"That being said OP...be the voice of reason when it comes to holiday times. Why go visit that ""family"" when you can just enjoy your own that you're making?

They gave birth to the man but that doesn't mean for the rest of his life he had to put up with it. And to be frank, having the position of ""I'm not going just to be apart of the 'go gina' parade"" is more than valid at this point."
246,"I think you should break up with her. She is using you as the launching pad to be able to fuck somebody else and still have the convenience of a stable relationship. We all deserve somebody who makes us number one in their priorities. Don't listen to her bullshit, end it."
247,"&gt; there are people who have never met homosexuals before, let alone the child of a homosexual couple, so they want to know how it works.

I would rate the classroom pretty low on the list of ""places we should be having this discussion"". I'd rate the teacher even lower on the list of ""people who should be starting this discussion"". Not to mention this is all shit you can literally get off google.

""Who is the dad in 2 mom relationships"" will get you a plethora of hand holding answers that will baby you and cater to your complete ignorance.

Because also, I'm sorry but - this is all some stupid shit coming from an adult. ""Who teaches you to work on cars if you don't have a dad!?""... well I have a dad and he sure as fuck didn't know anything about cars, so I'm not even sure what he's asking. 

""Who wears the pants"" (paraphrasing) is an equally ignorant and closed minded question that could easily be answered by talking to google. ...or a child psychiatrist who will hold your hand and walk you through learning the complexities of homosexual relationships. You don't have to know someone with 2 gay parents to find out how stupid it is to ask something like ""Who's the man in their relationship?"". Not to mention how invasive, intrusive, and disrespectful those type of questions can be. 

They're just archaic questions, asked in a shitty manner, in a shitty place, by someone who had no right to ask the shitty questions.

~~I don't even necessarily disagree with what you're suggesting about talking to him first, I just don't know if I agree with it either.~~ OK after my edit, I do disagree with you. This teacher doesn't need a soft talking to, he needs someone up in higher administration to hold his hand, to educate him on same sex couples, and to explain to him why what he did was inappropriate. Hopefully coupled with a slight reprimand for being so callous. That's not something OP should have to deal with."
248,"You're hiding in your room from him right now?! GURL, CALL 911, YOUR *STALKER* HAS YOU TRAPPED IN YOUR DORM ROOM. Stop being nice, at this point being nice will only encourage him, you don't owe him a goddamn thing. Have you told him flat out to leave you alone? Honestly I'M scared about what will happen if you talk to him alone, especially if you think he seems emotionally unstable.

He is stalking you. He is following you around and harassing you. Call the goddamn cops because *you are scared for a reason.*"
249,"Oh man here we go I remember your original post... I think the first three paragraphs are great. She shouldn't be trying to negatively impact your relationship with your son and it's important that you guys have put that on the table and started talking about it.

If you can't see how that 4th paragraph is going to cause huge problems... geez man. She wanted more children, which you are now not only doing with your new wife, but you're planning on suing for primary custody of the first one after you dazzle him with a new room and new siblings. That's going to be very tough on your ex and I can only advise that you try to handle the situation with compassion instead of a ""ha ha"" attitude. "
250,I'm very surprised you didn't follow them. It could have a range of interpretations from a crazy idea to wanting to fuck on the beach.

256,"It's pretty bizarre that your husband is willingly living in a bad neighborhood, at the expense of his family's safety, for some kind of street cred with his clients. Like yeah he'll be able to relate more to their struggles, but at the end of the day he's an upper middle class white dude who has never experienced what his clients have experienced and can dip any time. 

It sounds like he feels some sort of guilt because of his work, social work is super stressful and takes a huge toll on people mentally and emotionally. He needs to get it together though and remember he still has a family.

I wouldn't personally jump straight to divorce, but a serious talk and maybe a separation would probably be in order. Take your son somewhere safe and get the message across to your husband that if he can't prioritize his family's safety, he won't have a family anymore."
257,"I don't know if I would say it was an accident. I am not saying that he meant to knock the brother out, but seriously, who throws planks of wood at a party? That's not expected party behaviour, unless there is some new game I am completely unaware of."

261,"I was genuinely touched by how kind R was to me, I teared up a bit at it. It's for that reason I would feel really bad about cutting ties to make BF happy "
262,"That is what abusive, controlling boyfriends say. I had a bf that wouldn't allow me to wear makeup or anything that revealed my body in any way because he didn't want people to look at me and think about sex. At the time I thought he was being sweet and protective. Only after we broke up (because he cheated on me repeatedly) did I realize he was trying to harm my self esteem.

Nipples get hard. It is a natural reaction and there is nothing you can do to stop it from happening. There is nothing wrong with it. Everyone has nipples and everyone's nipples get hard on occasion.

What he is doing is trying to take over your body, make you feel ashamed of what your body does and how it feels, and he will use it to be abusive. There are many types of abuse.

Tell him that it's your body and you will dress however you feel comfortable. If he can't deal with that he can leave. Trust me, in the long run you will be better off.

Good luck."
263,"There's a severe logistics issue here.

Including Joseph's kids means that you have 2 adults, 3 teens, 2 preteens, and 2 kids that are younger. That's WAY beyond the fiscal and logistical bounds of two adults, especially when 4 of the kids are not well-known to you. That means that they will likely need their own chaperone, which would surely cost more $$$.

Joseph needs to put his $$$ where his mouth his. If he wants his kids to go, he should pay for them AND their chaperone to go. Otherwise, it's not logistically feasible to include them. That's the bottom line, and he has to accept that. I would put the ball in his court and wait."
264,"Umm yeah. When I was in an abusive relationship, every girl he'd dated before me was ""crazy"" and ""a liar"" - he made sure to tell me this from the very beginning, before I ever knew who any of his exes were. One time in an argument he whined about all of the women he's dated treating him badly and I said ""it's not my problem that you've had a shit taste in partners, but make no mistake, I am not the same as every woman you have ever dated.""

As it turns out, all of your partners will ""treat you poorly"" when you're being an abusive and manipulative psychopath.

Also, while I'm responding directly to you I'm going to tell you that him wanted you to delete his brothers number has nothing to do with respect, he wants to cut you off from any and all resources you might have that will help you escape your abusive relationship. This piece of human garbage is not worth your time, you're only 21 for fuck sake leave him and be happy. Hell, maybe date his brother, at least he gives a flying fuck about you."
265,"R sounds like a really awesome, mature man. 


The thing with your boyfriend. He called you some awful things, and it seems this isn't the first time? Why would you stay with someone who thinks so little of you? 


Him wanting you to cut contact with R is for one reason - he's furious that R stopped him from abusing you further. 

If he truly cared for you, surely he'd be apologizing profusely? Instead he's turning it all back on you. He's trying to manipulate you by refusing to engage in any discussion of his awful behavior until you cut contact with the one person who protected you from his torrent of abuse. 


Your boyfriend is a cruel, nasty person. I think you should listen to R. R is his brother, so R should be biased towards taking his brother's side. That he's taking your side speaks volumes about just how badly your boyfriend is treating you."
266,"Also give the invitations to you siblings seperatly.

Let them know they are welcome and leave it to you father to explain why he won't let them go."
267,"Moving in together is usually a sign that the relationship has some kind of expectation of permanency. ""Living together"" is generally the point at which people start calling that person their partner, start doing shared-life stuff, making shared-life plans. Marriage doesn't particularly mean anything to me as such (my partner is my partner, we have a shared home, a shared future, etc.). For me, marriage is just a piece of paper, a nice celebration of an existing situation, and it'll make it easier for us if we have kids or need to get a mortage. 

That said, not wanting to be married really can mean a lot. For some people, it does mean a lot more-- an acknowledgment of a change in situation, a public statement of ""yep, this one right here, this is the one I'm pretty sure I'm going to spend the rest of my life happier with, and I'm here and now ruling all others out.""

When you say ""I have no desire to get married, nor know if I ever will."" it can mean different things. For her, what it means is ""I don't see us as having a future, I don't see us having that shared life. I think we may be temporary.""

What you mean by it... well, that's for you to decide. It can mean, ""I think of marriage as part of settling down and having kids, and I don't think we're they're yet."" It can mean, ""I think of marriage as a life-time commitment. I do think you're the person I want to spend the rest of my life with, but it seems unwise to risk something that important when we've only lived together for 9 months."" It can mean, ""Actually, I love you, but I don't think I do want to spend the rest of my life with you."" It can mean, ""I'm worried that our futures aren't compatible.""

She's kind of told you what it means for her. You need to figure out what it means for you, why you don't feel it, and then, maybe, accept that if you don't want to marry her, if you don't see that ever happening, then it's not worth it for her to stay in limbo with you.

"
268,"&gt;He is willing to come back and apologize to my brother. I honestly don't know if it is a good idea, or even if he should.

This did it for me. OP's bf seems alright but OP is definitely whacko."
269,"Has there been any off behaviour recently?

I actually had a good friend in which this was happening. Wife was ""finding"" all of these ""clues"" to him cheating. Except he wasn't. He set up cameras, found out she was planting the shit.

She was trying to build a case that he was cheating to get a one up on the divorce she was planning.

Not saying this is your case, but damn I was floored about finding that out."
270,"Ignoring his level of maturity for calling things ""super gay,"" those obviously aren't purely platonic touches. He's basically admitting that there are sexual undertones to those actions and that's why, as a presumable straight man, he feels more comfortable doing them with women than with men. 

Ask him if he feels equally uncomfortable shaking a man's hand. He'll say no, then ask him to explain why since it's a kind of touch too."
271,"Wow OP, your boyfriend is really, really creepy.

Like seriously, he's up at 6:30 in the morning checking in on you.  That's like - what sane person does stuff like that? 

Also it's a bit of a red flag that over the course of your entire relationship you've stopped doing stuff by yourself - that he's more or less always there or you're at home, where he can track your location.  Like something he owns.

Ugh.  Is he in therapy? Because he should be in therapy so he can deal with his 'bad thoughts' in a sane way.  

Or to put it in another way: you shouldn't have to restrict your freedom just so he can use you as a crutch about 'bad thoughts'.
"
272,"&gt;&gt; time is running out for me to have a child before I'm too old

&gt;I'm sorry, what? You're only 23! 


RIGHT!!?

While it is EXTREMELY risky and inadvisable, women have had kids into their sixties. Just because  you are not 14 and pregnant does not mean you can't have kids after age.. 25 for example. 

Whatis in this girls head...?
"
273,"That would be challenging, but besides that, OP doesn't even really know these kids. There is no way in hell they should be taking them out of the country on a week long vacation. 

If Joseph can't understand that then that has to be his problem. "
274,"Yeah, not sure why you got downvoted, it's true. The married guy was taking advantage of her when she was naive and 17, the majority of the fault lies with him, but small towns like to gossip and the fact that she's a single mother is just going to add more fuel to their gossip. She should move back only if she thinks she's mentally strong enough to handle it"
275,"You both sound awful. You are acting like 13 yo girls. Don't post on faecbook, and talk to her one on one like a grown woman. Quit being passive aggressive and calling yourself a ""mama bear"" too. You sound unbearable."
276,'And don't you worry about me falling asleep. I STILL HAVE YOUR LETTER.'
277,"This is what we chalked it up to the first couple times too, but it looks like the same type of hair each time. Also the one she found last night was just laying right in the sink like it had been, dropped there. The part that really freaks me out is I have a routine of getting out of the shower, shaving, fixing my hair and then rinsing the sink. After that I won't go back into the bathroom. So how the hell does this mysterious hair get the in the sink five hours in between when I left for work and she found it? I'm starting to get really paranoid about it."
278,"Yes, your guests are definitely being disrespectful and crossing good boundaries. Do you have any idea why they are doing this? Is this your parents and they're still treating you like a child?"
279,"&gt; Frankly, she sounds super repressed and jealous. 

Yeah. I mean I'd understand if you were literally butt-ass-naked walking around the house, but there's absolutely no reason you should ever have to worry about just wearing normal girl things (even tank tops and shorts) around your brother.

Insinuating that it will **become** a problem is fucking disgusting, and shows how little your brother's SO thinks of him.

I also think it's **hilarious** that she's scared of your underwear. Like he's just going to dive face first into your bra and inhale deeply or some bullshit.

I lived in a family of 4, there were panties and bras CONSTANTLY mixed into my clothes. Do you know how weird it would have been **if I made it weird**?

Honestly even if you weren't his brother, none of your behavior is beyond what should be expected of a typical female/male living arrangement. Girls don't wear bras 24/7. Expecting that is fucking stupid. Shorts are cooler than jeans and way more comfortable, and even things like tank tops are just ... fucking clothes man...

I can't get over the thought of her thinking her boyfriend is going to start jacking off to his sisters underwear or something. That's how little she thinks of him.

I hope your brother gets his balls and freedoms back. Because holy shit."
280,"Jesus this is some Norman Bates type shit here. Your mum is being creepy as hell, it's none of her concern what you do with your body hair. 

Just shave it off, don't tell her. It's your body, your hair, your choice. If she asks just tell her it's none of her business and that her level of interest in your body is creepy. 

And I normally really don't suggest this because there are almost always circumstances but I think you'd be doing yourself a big favour of you start looking into moving out sooner rather than later. "
281,"I am a r/relationships addict. And we see weird stuff around here. None the less, I'm gob-smacked by the number of posts we see like this around here. I would say...three a month? Usually, the OP is dating a woman who is crazy jealous of a sister/niece/female cousin. And not, like, jealous of the amount of money or time being spent on a relative, but jealous of imagined romantic/sexual attention. 

I just don't get it. Like...are all of these women victims of incest themselves? Only children who don't get platonic, familial relationships? What is the common thread?

OP: Trust your sister. Even if it was a joke (it wasn't), it was a creepy, unfunny joke. "
282,"I wouldn't even do an ultimatum. I would just say ""I am not comfortable being in a relationship where my partner is in frequent contact with someone who is disrespecting our relationship. Nor am I comfortable being with someone who does not set clear boundaries against inappropiate behaviour."" And leave it at that. Which I guess is similar to an ultimatum, but not quite ""She goes or I go"". It also shifts the posturing away from him and Lizzie personally, and more on the behavior.

It lets him know your feelings and choice, and leaves the door open for him to change if he really wants a relationship for you.

On another note, he mentions that he doesn't want to leave his group of friends (which may be a convenient excuse to have Lizzie fawn over him), but are the group of friends comfortable with Lizzie's behavior? Maybe they would be willing to cut her loose since they now see what a nutjob she is"
283,"This isn't a husband problem, it's your problem. Another adult isn't responsible for soothing your social anxiety. It's within your scope to seek treatment for your anxiety; it's also within your scope to limit the number of public events that you attend."
284,"&gt;No one honestly wants to do that.

No, but they do it anyway. My dad, a beer and football on the couch guy through and through, came to all my ballet shows, took me to practice and competitions, missed going to a HUGE game for his team because I had a huge audition and I was frightened and I needed him once. I would have been happy with half of what he did. That's what good parents do, they put their children first. He hated it (although he would never admit that because he's a bro), but he did it, because he's my dad and he has my back. 

Bring a cushion and a fan. Suck it up. "

286,"I live in L.A. and have taught and worked literally all over the city for the past 9 years. 

As a math teacher, I could tell you exactly how economically stressed any given part of the city was by how easily my students could understand certain math concepts. In the most stressed neighborhoods, adding and subtracting negative numbers made kids' heads explode, for example. So would a word problem mentioning a shape (Joe and Linda are building a rectangular deck...). Both of these tasks require you to visualize the idea. Stressed out kids are pretty terrible at that. 

Poverty and violence stress kids out immensely, and stressed out people have a hard time thinking clearly. This has been shown in study after study. This has nothing to do (inherently) with race. Go to a more middle class area, and it was different. The kids knew what they were supposed to be doing. Putting ideas together was not so foreign to them. 

This is what is happening to your child, *right now.* 

Your husband thinks he is the Great Noble White Savior. He is hurting you more than himself, and is hurting your child most of all. 

You and your husband had the benefit of growing up without worrying about being hurt, targeted, losing your living situation, losing your relatives, food insecurity, the electric bill being paid. You got great educations and we're surrounded, for the most part, by functional people, adults and kids alike, whose needs were being met. 

If things went your husband's way, your child would receive none of these benefits. He or she would be as stressed just trying to keep their head down. Their #1 priority would be avoiding being a target. They would be victimized by gangs, and recruited by them, a pleasure neither of you adults would enjoy. 

If your husband told his clients what his grand idea for equality was, they would laugh at him. Any one of them would be thrilled to move to a better situation if they had the means. 

If your husband really wants to help, Step 1 is acquire cultural competence. For middle and upper class white people, that starts with keeping our little ears open and our big mouths shut. 

Step 2 is work hard and be good at his job. Living somewhere where his family was happy and the environment wasn't a dangerous distraction would help. Adults don't do well under chronic stress, either.

287,Too bad they already have a kid O_o
288,You would really be a jerk if you lead her on.
289,"Yeah...this is weird.  So...you can only truly be a Dad when you have a woman there to help you out?  You didn't try to get at least shared custody of your son yet?  That's pretty questionable behavior.  I think you and your girlfriend are having some unrealistic expectations of how your son is going to welcome her into the family.  It's pretty darn unusual for kids to want to be with their stepmoms more than their actual moms.  I think that whole painted-mural, big-brother to step-siblings thought you two have might be a pipe-dream.  

EDITED TO ADD:  I referenced the first post and somehow your girlfriend aged 2 years in a few weeks.  My guess is because OP got crucified in the last post, partially due to the age difference, and deleted it."

He's taking advantage of you, and, what's more, you keep letting him.

He's unlikely to stop, so really the decision you have before you is whether continuing to have a relationship with him is worth the money that you're spending on him."
295,"That doesn't matter! He's doing it NOW.

You can't get married like this to a person who is treating you like that.

Do you want to start out your married life, **legally bound**, to someone who is bullying you, dismissing you, demeaning you, and basically treating you like an accessory to his life? And an annoying accessory at that?

No  no NO.

A good partner does not treat their SO like this.

296,"I love the whole 'you're overreacting' thing.

If he does give it to you, write a receipt. ""Thank you for your payment on 01/06/2016 of €X towards your debt of €X. Yours, Throwaway."" Post him a copy, staple the postal receipt to your copy.

While he is unlikely to harass you through the courts or legal system, it is definitely possible and writing things down - when he knocks on your door, when he calls you, what money he has given you, etc - will make you safer in the long run."
298,"I think I see your work load increasing significantly in the near future. So many forms to check,  so little time and all that.

I'd probably start amusing myself in your shoes by playing the wide eyed innocent during get togethers. ""Oh, your husband us doing what? That sounds just awful! Have you tried marriage  counseling?  No, my dearest doesn't think I'm fat at all. Running works the kegels and the sex has never been better! Oh, he makes plenty of money, I'm just working to support an organization that educates on the dangers of infidelity.  You know, stds, pregnancies,  Betty Broderick. You should join too, AffairChick. I'm sure it would be so enlightening.  You can't stand Absent Neighbor? That's so sad.  I guess with her feeling the same way there's no hope of burying the hatchet.

One happy accident, yay, two happy accidents, yay but maybe she should rethink her method of prevention, but by the third, i gotta ask, is this really an accident at this point?  She does realize how pregnancy occurs right?  I mean if you want 3 kids, by all means, have 3!  Have 6 if that's what you want!  But can we please quit calling them accidents?  I think if I kept 'accidentally' getting pregnant I would be on the pill and an IUD and make him get a vasectomy AND wear a condom just for good measure."

I'd just hold your ground and refuse giving in. She needs to be more wise with her money, and that it's unfair to ask for such a large sum when she's so careless with it. For now, just push her to get a job and tell her that she needs to stand up on her own two feet, pay back the money she's borrowed and be more independent instead of asking others."

My wife is second generation Vietnamese (born here, foreign born parents), so American wedding culture isn't nearly as ingrained in her.  Like a lot of the corny little traditions, she knew nothing about.  So its definitely possible that the photographer just told her that this was part of the tradition, to have these photos for the husband.  I hadn't really thought of that..."

And 

&gt;we are also paying for a very expensive wedding for her


This suggest she is surrounded by people who enable her shitty behaviour. 

Despite having this:

&gt;so we now support her while she gets on her feet with 

As leverage over her actions, my guess is you don't want to deal with her yelling, screaming and attitude. So you don't do anything. And she continues to get away with murder. 

&gt;How can I make her see the error of her ways? 

You mean, error of **your ways**. As someone else said, you created this monster, and her fiancé is perpetuating it. 

I'd personally pull out all of the money for the wedding and tell her she has 1 month to move out. You've warned her about her attitude and she didn't listen. Time for some consequences (for the first time in her life). 
"
310,"Way ahead of you. I've never been so scared of someone much tinier than me, and I feel awful that she followed Alma."
311,"Do you never indulge your pregnant wife anything? Jesus Christ, she wants some pictures taken of a time in your life that will be fleeting and that you can never get back. Let her get the damn pictures. Wrangle your kid for them (This is a REALLY shitty excuse and makes me think pretty poorly of you). You will be glad to have these pictures in twenty years. There's almost no chance that you'll look at these pictures when your kids are grown and be like, ""Ugh, those fucking things. Wasn't THAT a shitty day."" "
312,"Even assuming OP is a serial killer (and **s**he probably isn't, since **s**he would have already, uh, *solved* this issue on h**er** own), blackmail is still illegal, and blackmailing someone into doing your coursework for you is very much expellable in every school or university I've ever set foot in.  **S**he has physical evidence of the blackmail as well.  The blackmailer can't do anything without demolishing her own life in the process.

That said, yeah, a conversation with a lawyer is a good idea."
313,"Well:
1) You didn't cause her behavior to be this crazy. She did that, so don't feel guilty at all. She did what she did. I am so sorry it happened. =(

2) I would have dismissed his concerns as well. Honestly, I would have had the same response. He was cautious because young girls are girls, you were like ""no seriously she is so close to us!"". You did nothing wrong. 


If you had ANY idea it would have happened, I have the utmost confidence you wouldn't have pushed it forward. He didn't either otherwise he would never have agreed to it, even with you pushing.

She sounds toxic, crazy, and like something you should avoid at all costs. But seriously though, you didn't cause this. I get the guilt, but you sound like a lovely soul and it hurts to think you believe you caused any of this. "
314,"And quit saying ""I killed...."", there was an auto accident caused by the other driver and the other driver did not survive. You did not seek this out, you did not cause this. Saying ""I killed...."" makes it sound like you are culpable. You are not. It was an accident. You didn't swerve to hit her and yell 25 points at the top of you lungs. While you were involved in the accident, it was in fact an accident."
315,"&gt; I'm afraid she'll get angry and dump me out of anger.

If she gets angry because you won't co-sign for her, then she's just using you. Good riddance. You don't owe her this."

I don't really need to read the rest. Cut her out of your life. She's toxic and abusive."
317,"Well, he's told you his plan. His plan is to work 15 hours a week for the rest of his life and put the burden of breadwinning on your shoulders. Which seems like a fucking shitty thing to do to your partner.

But what you do about it is up to you. You can accept that he's lazy and refuses to contribute to the family and continue on in the status quo. Or you can DO something about it.

"
318,"What do you think of the comments saying that maybe you should back off of trying to say *anything* to your sister about her body?  I know you mean well, but as someone who has been in her position, what she needs more than anything is for someone, *particularly* her family, to treat her like her boobs just are not even there.  You know how they say the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference?  Well, the cure to hating a part of your body does not start with loving it (even though one can eventually get there), but with realizing it *doesn't matter*.   And when even her brother obsesses over that part of her body, it's going to be really hard for her to be indifferent to it or realize that it's just a very small part of who she is.  

Can you do your sister a huge favor and never ever ever mention her boobs to her again?  If she mentions them, you don't have to run away, but you could say ""don't talk like that, you have so many amazing qualities like [insert absolutely anything about her personality or her brains here]."""
319,"It seems like you have a lot of life pondering to do, but the one thing I can say is, why not party with your girlfriend? Bring her to the things you're invited to.

It's really fun to get drunk with friends at parties, but honestly, the best part is stumbling home with your SO, making pizza bagels and then falling asleep together.

You can still have fun, you can still be young and crazy, but look at having an SO like a +1 to all those events, instead of being ""tied down"""

321,"I was the less favored child in my family. My brother was the ""Gina"" of my family. He is now a barely functioning adult, and I have funded my own education and bought a house with my husband without either of my parents' help. 

By ""helping"" Gina, your fiance's parents are making her less capable of earning her own way in life. I would not trade places with my brother for anything. I am a self-made woman, and he is totally co-dependent on them. It sucked for a long time and I was definitely resentful, but I just moved on and worked on making my own life better without worrying about my parents' influence or help.(It sounds like your fiance is trying to do the same). When my parents got older they realized they made mistakes in how they treated us. We are a lot closer now after my mom admitted that she made these mistakes.

You should absolutely NOT try to intervene on your SO's behalf. It's their relationship to work out. Hopefully they will come to the same conclusion that my parents and I did. "
322,"If I end up going on a date with him, I'll shred the letter.

323,"Seriously, watch your back OP.

Is it possible to drive home with an escort every time you get home after dark? -- a friend, a family member. She sounds like the type of crazy vindictive girl to attack you with a knife or go Lorena Bobbit on it on you.

* Tell EVERYONE you know about her arrest and the obsessive things she has done so they know what's up with her and can protect you. Delete all social media so she can't read up on you. 

* Ask friends and family not to tag you in pictures or mention you online. 

* Inform your job that by no means is she to be allowed in the office.

* Get some mace and don't be afraid to use it if she invades your personal space

I'm sorry this happened to you. She has gone off the deep end!!"
324,"I never ever give advice to be vindictive on this sub. While I enjoy reading about drama, I would feel bad about causing it in anyone's life.

Now that I've given that caveat: OP PLEASE DO THIS. And please tell us what happened.

Your sister sounds like she's the worst ... What sort of asshole behaves this way! I would love to hear that she got a proper comeuppance.

Totally with your husband on this btw - I personally would never bother with this sort of person. Yuck. What a selfish, self absorbed dungmuffin."

326,"If the proffers of money were a gift, she'll get nothing in court.  If they were a loan and she has evidence that they were a loan, she still doesn't get to set the repayment schedule unilaterally after the fact.  If you intend to repay the loan and want to avoid a tedious day in small claims court, counter her repayment schedule with a different one that you can afford.  Make her sign a promissory note outlining the terms (including how much you owe her, how much you already payed, and the number, interval and amount of the installments you intend to pay), and pay her by check with ""loan repayment"" written in the memo field.  If you don't intend to repay the loan, the amount of ugliness and wasted time you're in for will depend on the ratio of her vindictiveness to common sense, but unless there is some kind of paper trail, the only evidence she has of the debt is your stipulation to it.  

Since you *do* stipulate to it, don't be a shit: repay her.  But if you make a good faith effort to repay her in a reasonable amount of time given your finances and keep documentation that you have done so (cancelled checks, promissory note), she'll have no standing to sue you, not even the vanishingly slim one she has now."
327,"Agreed that although the girlfriend was using manipulation and other tactics, OP was thinking too short term and didn't think about all the possible consequences of sleeping with this girl. Its all fair game, but it suggests that OP wasn't that serious with his girlfriend. 

It's his call, but waiting until you known this girl for at least 15 years before marriage is a bit extreme and I can see how the girl would be very upset. She isn't blame free with how she acted with the news of his father, but it seems like OP was brushing off why he wanted to wait so long and she wanted an actual reason. So honestly, I feel more for the girl than I do for OP and it would probably be better for the both of them to go their separate ways."
328,"Well, either he's cheating on you/has a secret family or he isn't.  As adults and seeing as you've been in a relationship for 10 years, you could tell him your concerns, ask him who the text was for and say that you do want to be filled in on the drama in his life so you can get surety on what is going on.

Or alternatively, you can assume that he is cheating and call it off and find out that universal truth of breaking up: you really will be fine, you don't need another person to fulfil you, and you will carry on and find somebody else and be happy without him.

Also, you were 24 and he was 36 when you started dating and --- after ten years, you aren't living together and your lives are so separate that he openly admits that he keeps stuff away from you? Does this not wave any red flags to you?
"
329,"It's taken a while, but your fiance is finally showing you who he is. You're facing a serious fiance/in-law problem.

You need to have a serious talk with him about what *YOU* want. If the wedding is an indicator, your marriage is already getting off on the wrong foot. Is this how things are going to be going forward? Will his parents be calling the shots and will you be coerced into doing things because appearances or because of what his family wants?

Give some serious consideration to couples counseling so you two can get these things worked out now. Don't get married until your comfortable and have an equal say in how things proceed.

Good luck."

331,"/u/teresajs's advice is spot on because it's to the polite, to the point and also establishes the fact that you're not interest in being buddy-buddy with her in the future.

Not that it really matters, but I have to wonder what her motivations are for wanting to attend your wedding, especially since you've kept your distance from her.  Did she ever end up having children with someone else? Does she have a good relationship with her family or did she latch on to yours?  Has she been in a serious relationship since your split?  "

They may be in the best position to take action and help in your circumstance (i.e., they probably know what agencies to contact and can help you make a safety plan or find somewhere else to stay).

What is your relationship with your family like? The reason I don't immediately say ""tell family"" is because they may be biased and more likely to support him instead of you if they think his behavior sounds ""out of character"". School officials (or even child protective services, for that matter) will not have that same bias and will be much more willing to look at things objectively.

349,"&gt;To be honest, its made me see her in a much darker light

Truth is, her choice here is not evil, it's not unkind or wrong or lacking in compassion.  It is what it is.  I wouldn't take my parents or my parents in law.  They can afford a great home and if they couldn't I could for them.  That is just a lifestyle that is rather common now a'days.  I understand that you don't subscribe to it, but she does.  

Yes, your relationship is over, just as if you wanted kids and she didn't.  Or you wanted to live in a big city and she wanted mountains.  Or you want a big house and both of you to work 100 hour weeks and she wants small house and small hours.  Some lifestyles just aren't compatible, this is one of them.

You might have to involve the landlord, depending on the type of house and adjustments necessary. Doorstops and babyproofing certain handles are things you can do inside your home, but if it's the vent or something more technical, your landlord might need to get a maintenance guy.

363,"&gt; 10 is not a high number for a single girl at 26 man.

Yeah I gotta say... I was expecting it to be like 30+. I don't want to say ""most people"", but most people *I know* have about that many. I mean shit, that's like 3-5 people she was dating or in a relationship, and like 5 hookups over what, 11 years (if she started at like 16). 

If you break it down 10 is actually pretty low. Even worst case scenario (she's never been in a relationship before) that's still less than 1 partner a year. But assuming she's been in relationships we're talking 1 random hookup every other year. ...that's **nothing**. 

Your issue, OP, is that you're comparing it too much to yourself. I don't want to shame you but being a virgin at 22 is definitely not the norm anymore (I'm not saying it's abnormal or anything, plenty of people are). Hell, if you had 1 or 2 girlfriends in high school, and 1 or 2 in college you'd only be a couple behind her.

Also, you should learn from this. I don't **want** to know my partners number. I don't ask for details, I don't ask how I compare, I don't ask how big I am or how long I last compared to her previous partners... because it **doesn't fucking matter, and only serves to hurt you**. Is she happy with your sex life? Are you happy with yours? OK then, that sounds like a non-issue. "
364,"&gt;If she wants her kid to be called name a instead of name b, that's her decision, not mine

Nope, it's the kid's decision.  Unless she's being asked to be called the n-word or a cussword or something, the kid's going to be more persuasive in telling people her name than anyone else.  Hell, sometimes we don't even like our own nickname but it sticks for whatever reason - so I guess we don't even get 100% say over our own name... but we certainly have more say than our mothers do.  If Beezy likes to be called Beezy and it fits well and others use it, then she's going to be called Beezy no matter what your sister says."

Also, telling her about it was kind of an asshole thing to do, unless it was your way of drilling into her that it's over, but it doesn't seem like that was the intention.

So no, you didn't do anything wrong, other than not letting yourself admit that this relationship is over. Cut her off, so you can both move on. "

"
374,"I do not think this reflects on you but rather stems from Chris. You are probably very attractive on top of being feminine, and the long relationship you two have had threatens her. But I think there are a few key issues that stuck out to me.

&gt; He's also never had a problem getting female friends, but he always seems to end up getting a crush on them. 

This is bad because it sets a precedent of him escalating friendships into romantic relationships. Would you want to date a girl with a history of hitting on their friends, who had a beautiful, kind, long-term female friend that said she was heterosexual? Especially if some of her actions perhaps seemed a bit...romantic (even if they were not?) I feel like perhaps she is worried that he will develop a crush on you, and regardless of how you handle it, this is still generally inappropriate for Chris to be in the situation *if* he is expressing any romantic thoughts and feelings for you.

&gt; I've tried to be supportive, but some of the time

You have a heavy opinion and are involved in Chris's romantic life. He discusses intimate details of his relationship with you and also allows you to weigh in your opinion on what kind of girl you think he is dating and whether or not you approve.

&gt; sane enough when he first got close and I encouraged him to pursue her.

It honestly seems like he brings his girlfriends around you and then you screen them to see whether or not they are desirable. Even if this is not being done consciously, you still have a say in his relationships. This can be very threatening to many girls, but it is ultimately an issue between Chris and his lack of setting appropriate boundaries with the girl he is dating, rather than anything you are doing. Most people do indeed like to have their friend's opinions on relationships. 

However, something has me thinking that Chris might be expressing some inappropriate thoughts or feelings about you, or that he is *too* close for another girl to be comfortable with. Honestly, this is nothing to do with you, but it does not mean the other girls are automatically all crazy, jealous witches. If it is common for his girlfriends to get ""jealous,"" he might be exhibiting inappropriate behavior or prioritizing you over his relationship and doing things that essentially undermine his girlfriends. Many people can sense when someone ""likes"" someone else, and in a relationship that's just not okay. So regardless of your sexuality, it seems like Chris honestly might enjoy your company a bit...more than friends.

&gt;  I completely believe him because he's absolutely abysmal at telling girl's moods or what's wrong.

Additionally, his ""aloof"" demeanor might be due to the fact that he is more considerate of your feelings than his girlfriends. I sincerely believe his actions are causing the girls he is dating to be wary of you for some reason, and that he is either not caring or not hiding it well enough. This is just speculation though, but I know if my SO had a long-term friend (regardless of her sexuality) that he prioritized, thought was beautiful, that everyone joked they should get together, who he goes on date-type meetups with and whom knows almost everything about him, there would be issues. And I'm not really the jealous type, I just don't like being number two when I make a boyfriend number one.

&gt; Julia had started complaining about me and saying that he paid way too much attention to me.

Again, all of my previous comments are a bit affirmed by this. Regardless of your opinion or assessment of the situation, his girlfriend is seeing parts of Chris that you have not seen since you have never considered him in a romantic context. It genuinely could be that he just prioritizes you, likes you, and values you more than any other girl in his life, which leaves no room for a SO.

&gt; we had planned for it to just be the two of us

Also going on the numerous dates alone would be a little odd...I know you aren't straight, but if a girl that your girlfriend was dating was CONSTANTLY wanting to hang out with her alone and inviting her **without inviting you**, wouldn't that make you uncomfortable? Most couples generally are invited together to social events, especially when they've been introduced to another person. I was invited to a baby shower after meeting my SO's friends, once. They also tease about bringing me along. Of course I politely declined for not knowing the people having the baby (!) and because I don't feel the need to be constantly around him when with friends, but the offer is the important part. Having someone invite him one-on-one all the time must be a bit disheartening for the gf, especially if he's always taking you up on it. I'd be absolutely livid if my SO was going out with a random girl all the time without inviting me,  without saying much, no asking, just ""oh I'm with female friend btw lol :)"" on top of all of this...even if she was gay, it's just a bit rude for any couple.  

&gt;  he said that she was just joking, but I know that she definitely wasn't joking.

Yeah, he's aloof, or...trying to make you think that? TBH Given his following behavior, it seems to me like he knows exactly what's happening/what he is doing and you perhaps are the one not seeing the situation as clearly as you'd think. I feel like Julia is being a bit catty to you, but people do not generally act this way unless they feel very threatened. Especially not brazenly insulting you in front of your best friend/her SO, that means he clearly knows her feelings and at least thinks they're somewhat justified for whatever reason. Again, all on him, none of this reflects on you.

&gt; I noticed after that Chris started texting me less in the week following,

This means your assessment of Chris being aloof is wrong. He knows his girlfriends feelings. **If he felt that she was justified, do you really think he'd slowly be cutting contact?** I feel like the girlfriend's side would be EXTREMELY interesting to hear at this point. Again, I do not think you have done anything wrong, as you are just a good friend, I think Chris might have boundary issues and be inappropriately into you.

&gt; seeing as how he was 100% the wrong gender. He just mumbled something like ""Yeah, I know"" and again moved on.

Yeah....""I know."" Interesting. Honestly, he seems to be quite aware of everything he is doing. Not aloof in the slightest.

So yes, my perspective is that while you have done nothing wrong, Chris is not treating his girlfriends with the respect they deserve, prioritizing you over them, and might have some inappropriate or unrequited feelings for you. Have you ever given this thought or felt he might be into you? Because that's what I am getting.

**All of this being said**, Julia is being really rude and petty and handling it horribly. The passive aggression is impolite and the comment was very snarky. But given that those are the only two instances over months time, I feel like...again, she probably just knows a side of Chris that you are either aloof to or unaware of. 

If there's a history of girlfriends being jealous of you, I feel like there's a point in time where you need to stop instantly putting the blame on the ""Crazy jealous girls"" and instead take a look at Chris's behavior and see if you would appreciate it coming from a girlfriend of yours. 

Lastly,

&gt; I felt like he needed to have a say in the relationship too.

Why do you think that he did not have a say in it? Do you really think he blindly accepted and was like ""okay."" No. You've been his friend for 8 years, this wouldn't just happen. Most likely he was confronted with undeniable evidence that his feelings or expressions were inappropriate regarding you (and potentially others) and that him and his girlfriend came to a compromise. A lot of people have their SO's cut out friends, even ones they've known for years, because of unrequited love that often the other person is completely unaware of.

Then again, I could be wrong, but I urge you to consider this perspective and take it into account before pursuing any further action

375,"My grandparents love their assisted living facility. They have their own vey larger apartment and they have organized outings and social events. Meals are served at a fancy looking restaurant downstairs and there's even a hair salon and dance hall on site in addition to a gym, pool and spa. There are nice homes out there. They also prefer it. My grandmother is too damn stubborn to live in someone else's house and have I ask them for help. The home she is in gives her a feeling of independence as the assistance is as much or as little as she needs. "
376,"I don't think you should stop hating her. She is bad news. Bad, bad news. You don't have be actively rude, but don't let your guard down for one minute, and don't be phony. Before you go, discuss a game plan with your husband on how you will manage an encounter with her at this event. Don't go in unprepared. I recommend that you not be friendly, be civil but nonverbal. Don't let her get your husband alone, she might try some bullshit to frame him or something. And decline any photos with you guys in the pictures with her. Also, if your husband has to verbally shred her again, encourage him to not raise his voice, but shred her with facts...it could get filmed and become viral if too dramatic. Also, go in with a plan of who you wanna talk to and some idea of what you guys will be doing to enjoy the exhibition. "
377,"Was it weird that she didn't tell you first yes. 

Would I have wanted my wife to tell me first yes.

I would probably be annoyed by it. I am the father it does effect me more then the sister.

But honestly it sounds less like your wife ranking her sister above you and more like your wife getting caught up in the moment. Even if you asked her, and even if she nodded.

Honestly when I start to think would I be pissed if my wife thought her sister more important then me.

I have to say no not really. In specific situations maybe, like an argument between us, if the sister was being blatantly unreasonable.

But the problem is I can't see a situation where I would blatantly ask my significant other if I'm more important then her family. 

Simply because I assume that people don't rank their loved ones. Because to compare how much you love someone vs someone else is impossible.

Especially not in such a superficial number way, based on one admittedly important moment.

Is she more important then your parents, or siblings? 

Is she going to be more important then your child, or is your child going to be ""first""?

Besides the fact that you've been married three years, dated a bit more then that. Even if you dated her for 5 or 10 years that is her sister. Her twin sister they shared a womb for god sake. 

And this :

&gt; I haven't talked to her in a few days 

Is an over reaction. Especially if you're having a baby, especially in the days following that announcement.

Our styles of child care are not compatible, and it's best that you find someone who can more closely match your childcare needs."" (What do you mean? We want specifics. What isn't compatible?)  ""I feel that the standards you set forth for the care of your children is out of the realm of my experience. You'll need to find someone who is more comfortable providing the specific type of care you need for your children.""  (But WHY? Is it the feeding? Is it the art supplies? What is it?) ""Please understand that I am very sensitive to your needs as parents to parent your children as you see fit. I am not here to judge or criticize or point out this thing or that thing.

You shouldn't have surgery if you want or might want more kids.  But it means your wife is still going to have to bear the pain of surgery/contraception/your opps baby for the rest of your marriage.

She will likely mellow as she grows up more, but the more you attempt to squash her interests or wish she'd go away instead of engaging her, the worse it will be. How about as the adult you try to engage her more. Ask her why. Ask her why she feels that way, or acts that way to her sister, or how she feels about ____.

391,It's not victim blaming. That's just plain old common sense!
392,"&gt; It was an accident. But it was still his fault

When my little brother was about 3 years old, whenever he did something wrong he always said it wasn't on purpose. When he was 4, he learned that it doesn't always matter if it was an accident, but that you do have to be careful. 

This guy is 20 years older than him at the time and he still doesn't seem to grasp this concept."

That's one version. Here's another: 

""Steve, you're an awesome friend and I care a great deal about your friendship. That's why I am going to be honest, which is something only a good friend can or would do: your novel isn't ready for publication. I think it needs to be work shopped before you send it out again. I think a writing group and/or some creative writing classes would help you get it to fighting weight, but right now it has some serious flaws. You have great drive and potential, I can see that, but you need to fix a few issues. No editor is going to look at this until you fix some of the grammar flaws; it is too much work on their end to proof it for you. I think the ending needs more impact. Also, bringing some more depth to the characters would help. A writing group that can give you feedback and help you need to edit this to perfection is a resource that would really benefit your writing. Let me recommend a couple in the area.""

Then, here's the kind lie: 

""Sorry....my editor isn't taking new authors right now. I asked if they were interested in seeing new authors and they said they'd let me know, but I am pretty sure I got the brush off. Sorry, Steve, I tried"". And then you leave it at that. "

398,"Hang on.

In your old post, you wrote about a lot of physical incidents that occurred. For instance, you mentioned a time she tried to kill you as an infant when she left you in a bathtub of ice water. Clearly you have no memory of that and couldn't have been the one to put a stop to it. So one of your parents did, correct? You also mentioned that she's physically terrorized both your parents. Which means they knew she was fully capable of physical abuse. 

So they had AT LEAST one very clear example of physical abuse to you that nearly resulted in your death at her hands, and they knew she physically abused them. You also mentioned she burned you with cigarettes. Didn't they need medical treatment? Or what about the marks from her choking you? I mean, choking someone to the point of unconsciousness is going to leave some bruising or other traces.

My point is that yes, they knew. I'm sorry. I know that's hard to hear about people who are not only your family but who are fellow victims of your sister. But they knew. They pretended not to know, and maybe even managed to convince themselves that you weren't being physically abused, because it would have made life even harder and more hellish for them.

Please, please, PLEASE find a good therapist. You're right that it's done nothing to change your sister for the better, but you are a very different story. And you need someone who can help you unravel all the unhealthy mental mechanisms you've had to use to help yourself survive that place. You need to develop the tools that will help you maintain a healthy distance from your family and protect yourself, your mind, and your new life.

(Edited for a typo.)"
399,"Yeah. You're not making yourself look very good here. What I'm reading is ""My older sister rebelled against my strict parents. They abandoned her and focused on us, the good daughters. She took us in in the hopes that she could have a place in the family again. Her husband is really cool but we all agree she still sucks. It must be her because we are well behaved, nice, smart, teenage girls who do nothing wrong. So definitely her. But she's always sucked so none of us are surprised. My parents agree with us. So does her husband"". This may not be how you intend to come off, but after reading this post and your replies this is how I'm reading this.  Your poor sister. Christ. 


What can you do? Have a family meeting. Say, ""hey older sister. I know our parents were shitty to you and didn't give you what you needed when you were going through a hard time. And now we are stuck together because they kind of gave us no choice. We also recognize having two teenagers in a house when you are newly married is overwhelming. Can we, as a group, come up with some rules and expectations that we can all agree to that might make you feel better about this?""  Your parents obviously made mistakes with her as well. They were not amazing parents to her by treating her like this. And it seems some of the bitterness they have towardfs her is rubbing off on you. "
400,"This is a **terrible** fucking idea. Tell you girlfriend no, you won't do it understand any circumstances. If she won't listen, walk away."
401,"&gt; We've been doing good for the most part but **every time we fight it gets dark quickly.**

Is anyone going to talk about this also? This is scary shit. You know what makes a good relationship is people who can work through disagreements without it turning nasty. What she describes is toxic."
402,It seems to me like he's gathering evidence of your behavior possibly to use against you in a divorce/custody proceeding.  You should take steps to protect yourself from this possibility.  You may also want to start looking into it yourself.  Your relationship sounds like it's over.
403,"What does your husband know about your past and present? Did he hear this conversation? Because he needs to know everything.

The thing is, your parents are abusive NOW. Not in the past. And they're denying, AND refusing to promise not to hit a baby. You know who won't promise that? Monsters.


Your mom's spectacular emotional tantrum and gaslighting, denial, and guilt tripping are all further alarm bells,  and she's not sorry in the least for what she did to you. First she said she's ashamed, then you'll understand later, and then that she never did anything?? How does that make sense?


They can't watch your son, ever. They WILL hurt him. They've said as much.


Take some time in NC and talk to your husband. See a therapist! As a doctor you already know there are good and bad practitioners, and you really need to see someone about all of this. A broken bone will heal if left alone, but it might heal crooked - same analogy applies."
404,"&gt;one of my other friends told me how the group caught the boys in a different room with Teddy's hands around my son's neck. She laughed as she told me this story

They laughed off a child strangling a younger child? Uhm. How does someone just laugh about that? 

&gt;Am I overreacting to Teddy? Is he just being a 4 year old boy?

He sounds rough, even for a 4 year old boy. Not wanting your smaller kids around a child who can possibly cause them harm (throwing things, being rough, strangling them, etc) is completely fair in my view. The worst thing is that his parents are doing nothing at all to correct this behavior, which will lead him to thinking that it is completely fine to push other people around. Not okay.

What you're saying is that making your wife feel beautiful during her pregnancy is a ""waste of time and money.""  

&gt; I get doing it for our first because it was unique and special, 

...No. The first was just your first. There is nothing unique about a pregnant woman being pregnant, or a hetero couple having a kid. Nothing at all. It's special because it's your kid, and this kid shouldn't be any less special than that.  To say that the first one was unique and the second one isn't would, if I were your wife, definitely cause me to have a bit more concern that Kid 2 is going to be relatively neglected.

If you don't like the photographer for the first set, say, ""Wife, I'd really like to find a different artist for this one."" Shop around. Find someone whose photos you like better. 

&gt;Second, I really don't see the point. We never look at the photos from the first shoot. 

Of course you don't, they're not five years old yet.  You're going to be glad that you have them in another fifteen, in thirty. Photos aren't for today, they're for when the entire world has swung a different direction and you want to remember how things were."
411,"No, I completely understand. People say they ""like"" being able to snooze, but the way you wake up is easily moulded by routine and self-discipline. If she slept alone, she could hit snooze for 10 hours, but that's not the case. It's inconsiderate and selfish in this instance. 

She is kidding herself thinking that ""knowing"" she has more time to sleep is more important than actually GETTING that sleep."
412,"Yeah why couldn't he have said to her, ""WE are doing no cell phone after 8."" Why are you being positioned as the comptroller or whatever. Anyway, sounds like you're doing all the right things. Glad you are finding the resources you need to come up with a plan."

415,"Especially since it reads, to me, that ""help"" really meant ""do it for me."" It sounds like Michael was made to write her paper for her. How else could he sneak in plagiarism.

416,"It's a faux pas in general, but I think it's especially weird to have had an engagement party (did you throw it, or did someone else?) when you're not engaged, you're married.

Also, yes, four separate gift-giving events is a lot if the same people were invited to all of them.

That being said, I think a sincere apology on your part would go a long way to smooth things over, and you need to accompany it with a comment about how the decision was on both of you, not just your wife."
417,"As an identical twin here's my input. 

If I was taking a pregnancy test and hadn't talked to my SO yet (which is unlikely, but I digress) and was looking for support without freaking out the SO, I would probably get my sister on the phone or be texting her while I took it. I know she wouldn't share this information and I would probably tell SO ASAP anyway. 

If I was taking a pregnancy and talked to my SO and went to take it with him around, my twin would be an afterthought. This would be about me and my SO and our future! My twin sister has always been the person I'm in constant contact with but I would be more focused on this experience with the SO. 

OP, I suspect your sister's behavior shows that she is joined at the hip with her twin. That's just how some twins work, unfortunately. And, that's probably something you should have known if you guys have been together long enough to be married....It's not behavior that exactly comes out of nowhere. If it is out of nowhere you gotta nip it in the bud, essentially - you haven't got a problem with the twin,  but make it clear that you need to be a priority because you made a life commitment to each other by choice. 

All that aside I say it's just shitty for her to tell you that her twin sister is above you. In marriage you are symbolically ""leaving"" your family to join your spouse(not literally leaving them in the dust but you know what I mean); your marriage and subsequent offspring are your new and most important family. If that is not something one party is capable of, I am of the opinion you should not marry unless everyone's ok with the situation.  

Either way a serious talk needs to happen about your values and future. "
418,"Came here to agree.  Visiting Europe has always been a major bucket list item for me. I had one boyfriend, and we would always excitedly talk about the places we wanted to go once we were finished college/had money to go. Of course we broke up before that ever happened and I ended up with boyfriend #2.

I started talking about how I always wanted to visit Europe, and that we should take a vacation there sometime. His response? ""Been there, done that. Don't want to do it again."". I was heartbroken. Visiting Europe was going to be such a huge life moment for me, I almost broke up with him over that (We ended up compromising on visiting somewhere he hasn't been before.  Not my first choice, but I will still be happy).

In another story, my cousin and his girlfriend of one year ended up backpacking around Europe. I first thought ""Oh that's a bad idea, if they ever break up they are going to have tainted memories of that place."" Luckily they are getting married in two weeks, so there is a happy ending to that story.

So for some helpful advice,I suggest you and your girlfriend do the same compromise that my boyfriend and I did. Pick a location where you and your ex haven't been to, and you and your girlfriend can make all new, just the two of you memories."
419,"I'm in the same boat, and unfortunately it's going to keep happening. People get *weird* about other people's diets. Personally, my theory is that when people see me refuse something, they feel like I'm judging them for eating it. There's always this lingering idea that the more controlled your diet is, the better you are (or think you are) as a person. (I have celiac, so I get to tell people I can't have gluten. It's super fun. /s) The way to go is to never apologize for keeping yourself safe. You know what will happen if you eat your allergen, and in the end it doesn't matter if nobody else does. Your issue is real and deserves to be taken seriously.

Anyway, tips:  
* Compliment the food you can't have. Express a wish that you could eat it. ""Oh god, that cake looks so good. Have a slice in my honor."" ""Stupid doughnuts, quit tempting me.""  
* Make it clear it's medical, and define the consequences for eating the allergen. You shouldn't have to, but it does help sometimes. ""Oh yeah, it's obnoxious. Thank god I don't stop breathing or anything when I eat it, but last time I accidentally had [ingredient], I was *pretty damn uncomfortable* for a couple of days, believe you me.""  
* Don't act apologetic. People will react to how you set the tone. ""Nah, I can't. Allergic to [ingredient]."" Shrug, grab something you can eat, and munch happily while changing the subject.  
* Don't back down when you have a suspect food. You take it seriously, it's more likely they'll take it seriously. Don't risk cross contamination. ""Normally it'd be fine, but it was in with all the [ingredient] and I can't risk it. Too bad.""  
* If all else fails, get graphic. ""If I eat that, I will be shitting continuously for the next two days."" "
420,"just make sure you do it in a safe, well padded environment. She can wake up with a note taped to her forehead explaining the rest of the conversation. "
421,"Yeah, this is definitely a bigger issue than just the housing situation. Your boyfriend basically thinks he's right, and you're wrong, and he's going to force you to see his way somewhere down the line. 

He basically thinks you aren't smart enough to make up your own mind. He thinks he can change you, or bully you into seeing things his way. This is a bit of a red flag for signs of him being controlling further down the line."
422,"&gt; Mike and I split all of our bills 50/50, and he pays for groceries while I cook meals.

WAT. 

You make, at MOST, a quarter of what he makes. And he is calling all the shots in this relationship. And yes, it probably IS tied to the age difference. 

He also has a cold, shriveled, Grinch-y heart if he won't cut you any slack while you're struggling. You shouldn't even be paying 50% during your stable periods, that is ridiculous based on your income difference. 

It's MORE than reasonable to expect a romantic partner to help out when you're struggling. Isn't that part of the point of partnership?"
423,"Wait, so a $2k/mo apartment (edit: house, whatever) is out of the price range of Mike alone? What the hell? He should be able to afford that no problem if he's really making six figures. This guy is hiding something big from you."

One thing that article doesn't really cover though is the rape trial I alluded to.  In the middle of the book, for no apparent reason, Bink stumbles upon a rape trial in progress.  The judge concludes that since the woman in question knew her attacker and didn't run away immediately upon seeing him, she must have wanted to have sex.  She is then warned that she will be harshly disciplined if she brings up the matter ever again.  Bink looks at her and feels sympathy for her attacker, thinking to himself that you could hardly blame anyone for forcing her, since she is so beautiful, ""a creature created for no other purpose than r-- love."""
426,"He is going out with you because he likes you.  You are only 16 anyway, your body is still changing.  Your sisters sound cruel, don't give them any information that they can use to bully you. At their age they should act better.

Also, does your mom know how they treat you. I would have a talk with her and ask not to share more information. "
427,"I feel like I need ""Death threats mean never having to say you're sorry"" crocheted onto a pillow or something. Morbid but hilarious. And for the record OP, I hope you take this to heart.

436,"Holy shit, THIS. You do NOT want these photos ending up on the Internet and having your hands tied by copyright laws."
437,"Yup. I think, ""OK fiance, to show my excitement is only about marrying you and not the party, why don't you plan the flowers, invitations, centerpieces, color scheme, bridesmaids' hair and dresses, menu, and table gifts?"" would be the quickest way to get him to do a 180 on this BS."
438,
439,"First of all, the only point at which you need to come clean about this is when there is a relationship on the horizon. I think talking to her first about what her feelings are would be a good start.

Secondly, as a physician also, she has to know why you wouldn't want to share this information widely.  I really don't think she could fault you for not announcing this until there was some understanding that she was the only person you had told.  Be prepared for questions that are going to be uncomfortable though.  Be prepared to answer to her about how you are maintaining your mental health and safeguards you have intact to ensure that you are covered in the event that you lose insight about your circumstances.  (Maybe you never will, but she will probably want to know what plans you have to cover this eventuality).

Finally, this isn't a betrayal of her trust.  This is a situation in which you have to be sure that you can trust another person before you share intimate details of your life.  The person who put you on the spot before had no right to do that.  You did the best thing you could at the time and the fact that they all gossiped about your ""car accident"" just reinforces the need to be careful about who you tell anything to.  A lot of these people will be in competition with you, especially if you are getting great marks.  You do need to be wary.

Incidentally, just because you've put on some weight doesn't make you unattractive.  In time you'll probably adjust to your meds and find a good place to be (especially if school eased up and gives you a chance to be more active).  I would take her interest in you despite your appearance changing as an indicator of how truly attractive you are.

When my husband gains weight I think he looks awesome because he is a super attractive guy inside and out.  He doesn't need to be any particular size to achieve that.  I suspect you are the same way. "
440,"Yeah you were the instigator for this entire conflict. You asked him what he was looking at he told you. You then pushed him to share more he agreed and then you decided to throw a tantrum and slam the door. Which he justifiably got upset about, you then pushed him to have a conversation past the point he was done. But the major thing that you did wrong was try to prevent him from leaving that is abuse. Your hurt that he pushed but it sounds like there was no other way from to get himself out of that situation. You need to grow up"
441,"Well, what they said ranges from their simple political views to insensitive to pretty wildly offensive, they covered the full spectrum. Impressive. 

I don't think anyone can make this call for you. There's a chance they'd warm up and apologize, but if I was with my family when they started spouting off in front of my SO I'd be mortified and offended and correcting them. The fact your bf didn't doesn't speak very highly of him to me. 

I would lean towards don't waste your time. If he isn't on your team now, at the start of the relationship, when will he be? "
442,"I think this is likely driven by grief and she feels this promise is keeping her brother/father/his legacy alive. If you are not happy with changing your name, then you might have to accept you break up."
443,"&gt; That being said, I dont think a partner should have so much uncertainty in long-term relationship sustainability that they've deconstructed their alternate life plans down to the penny, which I dont think she has. 

Well why not though? It's just stability and like I said, just in case for uncertain things like death. If you don't even think she's planned it like that and then you're confusing me by saying she did plan it like that... huh

"
444,"You've got the flu, not a rare form of deadly cancer or ebola. Take care of yourself, call a friend/cab and go to the doctor if you feel dehydrated and can't keep anything down. Then, get better and go join her on vacation as soon as your fever drops w/o meds. Also, not having mom/baby being around people with flu/cold virus during the first six months is good practice, including you.


The elephant in the room here is the 3mo baby. You're working a lot of hours and need a break, and her job taking care of baby is a 24/7/365 job and she needs a break. You both probably haven't had a good night's sleep in the last three months. You both need a break. Meeting up with her family going to help her a lot, she can give the baby to somebody trusted and just have some time to herself (and you can too).  So cherish the night or two you have the house to yourself to sleep, and then go meet up with them on vacation and if the family offers two give you and her some alone time without the baby, take it and try to reconnect."
445,"&gt;We were planning to have a baby in 2016 after 9 years of being together.

No matter what, **put that plan on hold**.

&gt;She has shown no remorse, no loving feeling or attraction towards me. She never touches me, we haven't even kissed in the last 3 months.

She cheated on you for months, lied to you about it, and now this:

&gt;She has shown no remorse, no loving feeling or attraction towards me. She never touches me, we haven't even kissed in the last 3 months.

Dude, get yourself together. If you need to see a shrink, **do so**. I'd say definitely leave her. 

&gt;She felt she didn't have closure with him and kept meeting him behind my back. I found couple of months ago that she was still talking/meeting him in his office and spending time with him. I lost everything after she cheated second time around(for me it was still cheating as she was still meeting him)

Why the fuck are you still with her? She doesn't love you, doesn't respect you, and is the cause of your misery. Do not let her be the cause of any further misery and end things.

&gt;I am so scared of all the hurt i will cause if i divorce her. I don't know how to let go of someone after a decade. My parents/siblings would be devastated to say the least. My friends would never believe me and even if they do may side with her. She is perfect epitome of someone being perfect from outside.

I hate to sound heartless **but fuck them**. Your **first** priority is to yourself. They can get over it. Fuck them if they can't.

You owe yourself **more than this**. You only get **one shot** on this planet and you are blowing it with a piece of shit.

&gt;I still love her but i see no reason to take this abuse anymore. How do i go about this ?

Of course you still love her - you are an emotional being and it takes a while for your emotions to take what your reason is telling you.  You go about doing this by visiting a lawyer and **starting the process**.

446,You do realize that the placement of an IUD is also an in office surgical procedure like the vasectomy is? 
447,"There's an article on The AV Club called ""Revisiting the sad, misogynistic fantasy of Xanth"". You should read it. You'll probably find it interesting and cathartic because it savagely breaks down why the books are so awful. But there's also some discussion of where the appeal lies (especially for those who read them when they weren't old enough to know better), which could help you understand where he's coming from.

Personally I would keep reading (/skimming) through to the end in order to make him give Harry Potter a chance, but I'm a fast reader. If you want to bail, you should. Just talk to him about your concerns, making sure to be clear that you don't think HE is a sexist idiot for liking it (probably from when he was like 12, anyway). If he is a well educated, feminist guy in other ways, he should be able to respect your point of view when you talk about why the book is sexist."
448,"Yeah, they're great except for the abuse is like saying ""this smoothie is great, except for the horse manure in it"". It may only be a small percentage, but that doesn't mean you can separate it out, and if you can't separate it out, you certainly don't want it. "
449,"&gt; Mike is upset because I no longer want to go out to eat with him, see a movie, etc.

Mike isn't a good life partner in that he'll have your back when you're down.  He's a roommate you have sex with.

I agree with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lrz5y/i_27f_am_drowning_in_debt_but_my_bf_of_5_years/d3pnsuu).  It sounds like you're living above your means.

454,That is pretty spot on. 
455,"Also it sounds like dad is working all time time which means mom NEVER gets a break from the baby.

457,"A lot of people here are telling you to go and under normal circumstances I'd agree. However, they seem to be missing the fact that you have a drug problem. When someone has a drug problem you don't send them away to another state without supervision. You put them in rehab so they can get their life back on track. I'm sorry about your bio mom and I totally get you wanting to be there for your grandparents but dude...you can't even be there for yourself right now. You've got two people in your life not trying to control you but trying to help you get clean and actually have a freaking life. They want you to be able to work and have a future. If there's a chance you could slip back into drugs while you're away they aren't going to take that chance. You're an adult and can do what you want but if they refuse to home you when you get back and if there's a chance of drugs being a problem if you go then it won't be worth it. I'm sorry you're in such a hard place with this as it is your bio mom but chances are if she was even a little bit of a decent human being she wouldn't have wanted you to end up where she did or die the way she did. You're job right now is to get clean, get a job, and get independent.

460,"&gt;I know that most people are not going to like this, but thats okay. If I'm making a mistake, it's my mistake to make.

&gt;We agreed that I would sign a three month lease, or rent month to month. And in that time, we continue seeing each other. Also, in August we would find a new house to move into.

Yes, you're correct it is your mistake to make. This is a very stupid decision, but you have every right to make it. Moving in with your boyfriend of a couple months, who has demonstrated that he'll get jealous and rude to you when you're in a good situation and he's not. Who will lash out at you instead of working to fix his own situation. Who relies on you to get him out of bad life situations instead of doing so himself, even after he's been rude to you. And, will deny the truth and be dishonest.

Later on, remember he showed you right away how he was and how he operates in life. And, you chose to ignore it because you're in lurvvve and it's fun picking out household decor together. In fact you chose to get even MORE enmeshed with him before waiting to see if he will change this trait, or knowing him long enough to find out about his other traits. Before even living in the same city as him and experiencing what it is like to be around him on a regular basis . Just do your friends and family a favor and don't talk their ears off about how crappy he treats you next time there's something good in your life. After all as you whined, this is YOUR choice. So don't burden anyone else with it later. And that's fine.

Edit: I wrote this before I went back to the original post and read the updates in the comments about the hammock and IKEA, not to mention the soap. After reading that I think that anyone dumb enough to move in with this man after a few months of dating (long distance dating!) deserves what is coming to them. If nothing else it will be the kind of suffering that  builds some sorely-needed maturity and life experience."
461,"Who exactly is putting pressure on you to have a kid before you are 30? Family? Yourself? Also, I'm a bit confused, if you've decided you don't want to have kids *at all* why are you rationalising and planning when you should have them? And finally, yeah, there's a large middle ground between having a kid at 60 and having one at 23! Even if you want to have a kid before 30 (which is young by many people's standards) you have *7 years* until you are 30. You seriously do not need to be in any rush!  Really! 

But again, why is this even relevant when the core problem is apparently that you don't actually want to have kids ever at all?"

465,"&gt;So I guess I'm kinda asking if she's overreacting?

She's not. I'll explain why in a minute.

&gt;Or If I'm an idiot who nearly lost the love of my life for something so stupid?

She warned you straight up how she feels about porn. You went ahead and looked at porn. You were careless about hiding it, and now you've been caught. 

You ignored her feelings on the matter.

But here's the thing. I completely accept that some people cannot handle porn in their relationships. But you simply can't deny a person porn (and essentially masturbation as a whole, as lots of people prefer/need porn during masturbation) and sex simultaneously. That's selfish and unfair.

I don't know if she's withholding sex from you for outrageous periods (if her being tired and turning you down for sex is uncommon then that's not withholding sex, it's being too tired for a night), but if she isn't, then even more reason for her to be upset.

But she didn't do anything wrong. You didn't do anything wrong. You two just might be incompatible on this and will need to reach a compromise or go your separate ways. It obviously needs further discussion but she needs to reach a point where she's not so emotional about it.

&gt;It's just porn to me and it would not bother me at all if she masturbated to it. 

Keep in mind that just because you're okay with it doesn't mean that she is, or should be. Lots of people are going to tell you that she's wrong and unreasonable, but that's just not true. She's as entitled to her feelings as you are. You two just need to get on the same level here by talking it out.

This is something that needs to be totally resolved before you two get married. And if she sets an ultimatum that you don't look at porn anymore, you tell her how frequently you need sex, and if you agree to this, then you stick with it. Don't lie to make her happy and then do it behind her back, because if she finds out, she will be furious. And if you don't want to give up porn for her, then don't, but have the courtesy to be upfront and honest and about it and go your separate ways if you can't work it out.

It seems silly to a lot of people, but some people just aren't okay with porn. It doesn't make them terrible, controlling, dangerously insecure people. "
466,"Risks aren't avoidable. I really have to chime in here.

This is an extreme scenario, but it's entirely relevant. 

My parents were married for nearly 20 years. My dad was in his 40s when he died. Suddenly. He had been sick, but not ""death"" sick. But for whatever reasons, he fell ill. It was a horrible and long struggle him, especially towards the end. We were given false hope by doctors nearly a day before he died that he was actually making progress. The next day, he died. It was heartbreaking. The most awful experience. I was a child and a decade on the impact still wrecks havoc on my life, but largely speaking my family and I are in a better place than we were for oh the first 6-7 years following his death.

And you know what. My mom took the leap of faith and got married. Through sickness and in health. But like any logical-minded people, my father and her recognized the risks and made their wills.

Not because they expected either to die, but when you are married and have children it would be insane and selfish as well as incredibly short-sighted to not have your affairs in order just in case. Because you never know.

My father's will and estate didn't amount to much. We were never wealthy people. But it helped us be able to afford his funeral and figure out how to support the family on a single parent's income with 3 children (2 of which were still very young). 

Had my parents not had their PLAN B... Their contingency plans, I can't imagine how horrible life would be now. I surely wouldn't have gone to college. We probably would have had to move homes into a worse neighborhood. We struggled financially, horribly for years after my dad died because we relied on his income. But his will and his life insurance helped significantly in that our life wasn't so displaced after his death. 

It was absolutely heartbreaking when my mother, just a couple of years now told me she never imagined she'd have her husband stolen from her like that. She still struggles to this day with the idea of going through the rest of her life without him.

Even though she had a will, even though she knew he was sick, she never made a ""plan B"" for life after his death. She didn't know what she wanted for herself, because for 20 years she had been a wife and a mother with a loving husband and a life partner. Then all of a sudden, she was in her early 40s and a widow with 3 kids. She had to figure out life anew without any direction, but a great support system. 

So, it taught me ""Plan B"". Seeing what my mom went through.

I am of the same exact mind as your girlfriend. Even when I'm involved with somebody: devoted, deeply caring, and imagining them in my future -- I don't ignore the reality that for some circumstance that I can't predict they might not be there... So I have to have a PLAN B. 

Because there is *nothing* worse than feeling bereft and without any direction. 

My ex boyfriend couldn't understand that. He was like you and offended that despite wanting to have these big life plans and goals with him, I still had other goals outside or beyond our relationship just in case things didn't work out. And good thing, because as aforementioned: he is an ex. If life had kept on the track with him, we'd likely be on our way to engaged, I'd be living in his country, and not pursuing life in my own country doing what I am now. Neither is a better or worse option: it just is. 

So you need to take a step back and not take it so personal, because she's not doing this in spite of or because of you. She's doing it because she's reasonable. "
467,I'm a but confused. How does you being conceived by in vitro make him not your bio dad? Why does that fact matter at all? What is even the source of the blackmail since you know about the in vitro? Just what in general
468,Leave now and take the dog with you.
469,"When I first starting reading your post, I agreed with you - you didn't necessarily do anything wrong by asking for a prenup. But, as you went on I  got some insight into your general attitude towards women and life, my hunch is that it probably wasn't that you asked for a prenup, but HOW you asked. Framing these types of conversations the right way is important and so is being respectful of the other party. There's nothing inherently wrong with wanting a prenup. It can be a valuable tool to protect both people going into a marriage and can be a jumping off point for important discussions about what you both ultimately think is fair. From your post, I can see pretty clearly that's not how you approached this discussion. Likely, you came at her with a demand that she enter into an agreement that heavily favored you and that she needed to sign it to prove to you she wasn't a gold digger. I would probably have refused too, because that's just flat out not how I want to be treated or viewed by my future husband. 

FYI, my husband and I do have a prenup. The way he handled that situation showed me he was a quality, respectful man who I was proud to be marrying. He never once suggested he could have ever viewed me as a gold digger, no matter what the outcome. "

The only reason I still love my brother and am close with him is because he told our parents that they were treating him with favoritism and it needed to stop.

472,There is no rush to get engaged or married. If he can't afford a $150 ring then he can't afford an independent life. Don't rush this.
473,"While what you have written here certainly paints her in a less than favorable light, and makes your decisions seem justified, this is one of those posts that seem a little suspicious to me.

Without having heard the whole conversation I can't say for sure, but the part about her accusing you of kidnapping her seems strange. Did she ask to be let out so she could go out and you said something like, ""No, we're going back."" 

What seems odd to me is that you point out that the car doors were unlocked and you were only going 25 miles per hour, like you're implying that she could opened the car door, and tucked and rolled her way to freedom at any time. 

Plus she didn't act like you were kidnapping her, she asked to be let out of the car, while she was super angry. When I read this title, I thought you meant she pretended that you were kidnapping her to other people, like at a drivethrough she shouted, ""Help! Help! I'm being kidnapped!"" to some random passersby as a prank. 

Like I said, I wasn't there, she could've been exactly as crazy and out of line as you described, but this story doesn't quite add up to me the way some of the others do, I have a sneaking suspicion you might have been significantly less reasonable than you are letting on."
474,"&gt;Kid: ""mom it's ok i didn't really mind""

haha"
475,"Branding people (and particularly women) people as crazy with little-to-no background information really bothers me. Maybe it's just having been in a gaslighting relationship, but it's kind of insulting to both women and genuinely mentally ill people, and it doesn't exactly constitute helpful advice.

What I think is, it was obviously a poor decision to propose out of the blue, but it sounds like she really cares about him and thought she was doing something romantic. The way to handle it is not to run away (and hurt her feelings even more), but to listen to her and talk about why. Obviously OP has a decision to make about the future of the relationship, but let's keep it rational and respectful."

You literally just lectured her about tainting your relationship, don't intentionally do the same thing.

She needs to own up to her actions. Tell her that."
485,"Sometimes people won't believe something horrible is possible until it happens.

They don't want to believe that this guy is a bad person. They don't want to accepts that someone they considered to be a friend tried to intimidate a girl at a party. You can't blame people for wanting to see the good in someone, but they shouldn't try to deny reality either.

I would present your side of the story (including what you observed and why you acted) to anyone who's still giving you crap about what happened, and then ask them, given what you saw and heard, what they think you should have done instead. They'll probably say they know this guy, he wouldn't hurt anyone, etc. -- but you don't know that and it seems pretty clear that girl didn't want anything to do with him.

You're much better off having your friends think you overreacted than having guilt for ignoring what was clearly a problem."

488,"&gt; Is Wilson the golden child in the family?

No, my other brother was the golden child but he married someone and moved to australia. He keeps in touch via skype but he hasn't visited in 6 years and it kills my parents that they have grandkids so far away. I do think ""losing"" him was very hard on my parents. I think the idea that anyone else could be lost (or threaten to leave the family fold) is frightening to them. They are loathe to risk that so they let Wilson call the shots. Their connection to him has always been more tentative as he's more independent than the rest of us were. 

I think they feel like my relationship with them is very secure, I've always been loyal to the family and made sure to make time for my family. He's much less likely to show up to family events unless they call and do a bit of convincing. So they're probably more likely to take this event out on me and defend him because he's already a more distant part of the family tree. 

Maybe. Families are complex and maybe I'm wrong. "

Someone even replaced the wedding ring with a toonie (Canadian $2 coin) in the box. They even used a cheap ballpoint pen to ""sign"" the wedding registry! Everyone was laughing and having a good time with this because it was the REHEARSAL, not the ceremony."
494,"You couldn't wear a bathing suit? Shorts? Underwear? No one could find a big baggy shirt for the girl? *Really*?

I think this is one of those things where it's a very personal line to draw.   I don't think you were *wrong* per say - I think you were stupid. Really really stupid.  *If* you honest to god weren't thinking anything sexual *at all*.  Which is questionable, I mean you had to have known chilling with a topless girl in a pool wasn't ok.  

 But I don't think she's wrong at all for being upset either. This crossed a line that she wasn't ok with crossing, and I think that's understandable. 

Learn from it and move on if it's cooked. "
495,"Um, yea. Another woman, a man, a selection of common farm animals - it's still cheating. "
496,"It's a bit odd that your sister didn't cover up with a twelve year old present, but other than that she didn't do anything wrong. Perhaps that's what is bothering your wife, at the heart of it? Your son should definitely be made reminded of appropriate boundaries and courtesy moving forward."
497,"What you said was very harsh, but I think your friendship with her ended when her pregnancy did. I would leave it alone.

Just want to echo everyone's warnings  about how much of a danger this woman is to you right now. There have been documented cases of women who lose their babies who have targeted/killed new mothers in order to steal their babies.

Please be careful, document whatever you can, and protect yourself and your child."
498,"Call the police, why is that not the first thing that came to your mind? Also that 18 year age gap is weird. I know you've complained for people bringing it up but it's kinda gross. "
499,"Aw, your friend turned into a crust punk while you weren't looking and you can't deal. It's not my style either, but a good undergrad friend got into a similar music scene, slowly adopted the personal style, and is happy as a clam. He seems a lot happier than I am in grad school to be honest, and we still meet up for bike rides when I'm in town. Your pal's punk house sounds worse than most (the dog shit and basement floods are definitely an issue) but otherwise, it is not your place to intervene. It looks like squalor, and definitely is squalor, but in this case it's a distinct cultural choice. He's got some defined professional goals, so it sounds like he's doing well as a person and not struggling with some kind of addiction or other problem a friend's support could help. If you don't think you want to accept the situation you should gracefully bow out. "
500,"Yes, this! His comment about OP's school accounts make me believe he's got access to them, and possibly other accounts. "
501,"Your extremely defensive reaction was not unwarranted frankly.

This woman is a legitimate danger, something about the trauma of her miscarriage has changed her in a fairly frightening way, and until she gets help she poses a very real threat."
502,I actually feel like gagging just reading your post. He sounds absolutely disgusting. Is this really something you want to learn to live with?
503,"You need to call animal services. And I would also call child services for past abuse. 

Your father is an asshole abuser. You can't stay there for the next 5 years without compromising your mental health.

You seem to be a very mature person, even more as you are only 13. 

He just took his abuse from you to the dog."
504,"If he's such a good friend, talk to him and explain that what he's saying is rude, hurtful and actually pretty harmful as you're nowhere near fat. Tell him you don't want to hear this shit in future- you don't comment on his body and you don't understand why he thinks it's ok to comment on yours.

I suspect you'll quickly confirm that he's not as good a guy as you think. You might already know this deep down, because you've either told him you don't like it and it hasn't stopped or you know he will be defensive, agressive or dismissive and so have come to a help forum to find a magical way to tell him he's hurt you that will result in him to not being those things. I dunno, he might be decent about it. I'd be surprised though."
505,"Thanks, the ""teaching moment"" is a great point. I definitely don't need to be taught how to use my money at this point, and by someone who should be *helping*. 

These responses are eye-opening for sure. I think because our relationship has been so easy in all other aspects, I've given a pass on this one. In addition to my own guilt over needing to feel ""independent"" in all ways. But it's taken me being backed into a financial corner to realize this isn't okay, and your responses to point out this is a huge character flaw."
506,"I think you should break up with her dude. It seems to me she has some of her own issues she might be dealing with but she doesn't want to tell you about it or she hasn't really realised it herself. With what you're doing and your busy schedule, you deserve someone who could provide for your needs and you can do the same for them but it doesn't look like she can provide for you or you could provide any emotional support to her so, for both of your sakes, break it off."
507,Exactly.  A few comments here are suggesting he get right down on her level...  Who is that going to help?  Certainly not his kids.
508,"A lot of people are bringing up the fact that you've sacrificed nothing and your girlfriend sacrificed everything. So instead of calling you out on that here are a few compromises that might level the playing field a bit. 

- Finding someone who can take your dad overnight a couple times a month, so you two can have complete privacy in your home to have a romantic dinner, sex on the couch, whatever. Yes, I know you think your dad's no problem once he goes to bed, but that's not true at all. It's important to have some complete alone time in the house. 

- If there's a spare room available in your house, let your girlfriend use it as an office/craft room/whatever she's into, so she has a private space she can get away to. 

- A promise that you'll occasionally be willing to find him overnight care, so you guys can still go on vacations, or just away for the weekend. 

- You, dad, and girlfriend sitting down and drawing up an official roommate agreement/list of house rules. I know this seems like overkill but it's a smart thing to do in any living situation. 

- Try to find day programs for dad. There might be ""senior daycare"" type programs in your area. This is good for both your dad and girlfriend. He's out of the house so she has more privacy, and he gets to socialize with people his own age. 

- Don't dump half the care on her. He's your father, and you're the one that wants him at home. Both of you need to have a conversation about what types of care she can provide, how often she can provide it, etc. Once you come to an agreement, respect it. Don't try to force more chores on her. Revisit the agreement whenever he declines and the level of care needed changes. 

- Most importantly, sit down and talk to your girlfriend tomorrow. Tell her you understand that she's making a huge sacrifice, and you want to make things easier on her. Ask her what she thinks can be done to make her more comfortable in her home, and try your best to accommodate. 

And please, for your own good, accept that eventually your dad may need to go to a home. If he ends up developing dementia or Alzheimer's he WILL NOT be safe with you once it gets bad. It won't be a matter of him being too much work, he'll just need to have round the clock professional care. If you guys take your eyes off him for a minute, he could be out the door with the car keys thinking he needs to drive to work. You are not able to look after a late stage Alzheimer's or dementia patient at home. A round the clock care worker is not even able to safely take care of an Alzheimer's or dementia patient at home. He'll need to be in a facility specifically designed to be secure."
509,"I think you're doing the right thing. Your nephew sounds like he could use a fun break with you and his friend, and it's so awesome of you to do this for him. 

Fourteen is plenty old enough to understand that when you behave badly, you don't get invited places. It doesn't mean you don't love your nieces, it means they have proven unable to follow the rules, and you and your nephew do not have to worry about them acting shitty. Going to Disneyland is a privilege, not a right, and privileges are extended to those that earn them. You're a great aunt, and you're giving them boundaries and teaching them life lessons that no other adult in their lives has been willing to extend the effort to teach them. Better Disneyland now than a college scholarship or job opportunity in a few years. You can love them all equally while treating them all uniquely, according to their needs. They are not all the same person, despite being the same age, and it does them a disservice to treat them the same. 

If you really feel bad for your nieces, maybe you can organize doing something special (not an amusement park) on another date with each of them. I'd do it separate from each other. One, that way you can say that you're giving them each individual time and attention. Two, it sounds like they're more bearable separately. And three, twins tend to be lumped in together as one person in two bodies by most people, and individual time that caters to them as separate people with their own interests would likely benefit them greatly. It doesn't have to be big. Maybe you can take one to a movie and another to laser tag or something. You could even let them bring a friend if you want to, though you certainly don't have to. 

Personally, I'd probably frame it in two parts to the family: one, that their history of misbehaving and not following rules at amusement parks means that you're not up to taking them to one; and two, that you're trying to spend time with your nieces and nephews as individuals, and you will arrange something special with each of them on another date. 

You don't have to do it this way and you're under no obligation to placate anyone, but it's likely the best strategy to keep the peace. Don't diminish this experience for you and your nephew though. He's earned a break he doesn't have to share with his cousins. And so have you. 

Edit: Framing it to your family as less ""They were spoiled brats who ignored the rules and ruined the whole thing last time"", and more ""They were unable to follow the rules and ran off without permission despite warnings and knowing the rules the last few times, and I don't feel I can keep them safe because they ran off alone after promising not to last time. It's a big place and far from home, and I just don't feel I'm up to the task of ensuring their safety in that circumstance"" may help them accept it more. They'll likely still be pushy assholes about it, but it's a lot harder to argue about the safety aspect with someone. If they argue, you can reply that you don't feel it's wise or fair to compromise their safety in that setting, which is pretty hard to argue with without seeming like an asshole who doesn't care about the safety of their child. "
510,"&gt; I'm tossing up about reaching out to BFs ex, but I'm not sure if that will cause more problems for everyone. 

I don't think it'll cause any issues for anyone except your ex-boyfriend. I think that if you would like another person to help support you that knows *exactly* what you've been through, it might benefit you to talk to her if you'd like. You are not obligated by any means of course, but if you think it'd help you come to terms with the situation or assist you at all in the ""well...what now?"" part, then go for it. She may have dealt with these erratic behaviors in the past and might give some advice that Reddit may not have thought of. 

This being said, I normally am the type of person who always is really ""put-together"" even if I'm destroyed on the inside, and if I were in your shoes, the affair allegations would seriously upset me because my reputation is important. Although now I am sure it is the last of your concerns, I think the rest seems to be well taken care of. Your ex's family is supportive, extremely, and is willing to assist you while you get back on your feet with housing, and you seem to have a good head on your shoulders. So, the things I can tell you that you may/may not already know:

 * Read up the laws in your vicinity about pepper spray and/or any other type of self-defense tool.  

It is always good to know everything about how you can/cannot use the pepper spray and if there are any mandatory regulations.

 * If you potentially could have any access to a lawyer, consider a free consultation. **I would do this part without discussing it with his family, as while they will protect you, they are still his family and might not take too kindly to the trying to arrest him part.**

I am not a lawyer, but so far you have *explicit threatening text messages* sent to R's phone that I would try to screenshot and save. You have *destruction of property* with R's apartment and potentially any of your things. You have *slander* with him spreading the pornographic photographs around. I'd screenshot and save all the evidence on as many devices as possible. Take photographs of the damage that your ex has done to R's rental property. 

He needs to be properly held accountable for his actions, and I feel that while his family is helping, he might be getting off a little easy....I can guarantee if it wasn't his family members, they'd have the police called as soon as the threatening texts were sent and he'd probably be arrested for showing up and attempting to create that scene. Of course this is all in retrospect, but I feel like this menace to society needs to be off the streets. 

 * Damage control. Now, even without a lawyer, what you *can* do still is document/photograph everything for proof to the police and the landlord that this was caused by R's brother and to see if you perhaps can get him to be held accountable for the destruction of property. I'd report every Facebook post and photograph that is insinuating an affair and, if you do lawyer up and this is not against his advice, I'd try posting damage control about the things being said. One simple ""There have been allegations about my relationship ending that are simply not true"" post and an allusion to his violent behavior might help, along with any of the photographic evidence that you have with texts supporting your version over his. Additionally, go to the police with every threatening text, email, letter, whatever type of written communications that your ex boyfriend sent you and use this as a basis for either a restraining order or more. Threatening bodily harm or worse is against the law. 

Overall OP, I'm glad you got out and we're all really happy to hear you are safe and that things turned out mostly okay. Things can only look up from here and it'll be like a weight lifted off your shoulders without that man in your life. Stay strong "
511,"I agree with you.  The early teens are a really important time for determining what kind of person he'll grow into, and disregarding a 13/14 year old to the point of his entire family forgetting his birthday is probably not a good thing at all.  It really smacks of a single symptom of a more systemic issue, because nobody who actively raises their kid 90% of the time is going to forget their birthday, let alone leave him with a friend and take off on a vacation to which he isn't invited on that day.

  At least his friends knew, even if it was only due to the Facebook reminder, so he wasn't *completely* alone."
512,"Buying clothes is an absolute basic. That's like saying ""yeah I feed them"". Redecorating is also pretty basic. Do you play with them/spend time with them/hang out with them at all? 
"
513,"Just yesterday someone commented in another thread, ""Someone who truly cares about you won't compromise your education."" He's telling you to put your Master's on hold for a baby. How can that possibly be wanting what's best for you?"
514,Listen to this one. Your mother just did you a huge favor. She wants out of a relationship where she manipulates you and then tries to pull your fiance into it. Let her go and realize how lucky you are for her to cut ties. 
515,"Bank of Mommy and Daddy closed, and she's shopping around for a new one to fund her irresponsible spending.  You're right to say no, and she needs to find a way to fund her own life."
516,"You don't have to go so far.  A firm and relatively loud ""*Stop* touching me"" will likely do wonders.  Loud enough that people look over, but not so loud as to make a scene.  

If you're not comfortable doing even that then go right to HR, but I do encourage you to consider this option.  Being able to tell people off appropriately is a huge advantage in work and life."
517,And a cheater. The only reason he hasn't actually cheated yet is because this other girl isn't interested. 
518,"Drugs. I'm calling it right now, it's drugs."
519,"It doesn't help that I've been here for over 5+ years and have been busting my ass. I have received awards for excellence and outstanding efforts.

 So what the fuck!"
520,"I am so sorry this happened. All of it. 

In a sense, we can't help who we love. Your wife went through a tremendous ordeal, physically, and emotionally. It's natural that she latched onto her source of support during that time. It seems that she associated you with her loss and that made it too hard for her to feel close to you. 

She and your brother fell in love, but she didn't leave you for him. She didn't sleep with him. And when he realized what had happened to them, he fled. I understand you feel betrayed by two people that you love, but I think given time you can also have empathy for them, and sympathy for the way they handled the situation.

Counseling, individually and joint, for your grief, and this situation could help. I don't think anything is over for you and your wife. It seems clear to me that she still loves you also. Her feelings will fade in time."
521,"Absolutely everyone in my family is telling me to get out while they're doing their thing but that seems like a really, really bad idea. "
522,Are you saying it's not ok for someone to have an affair because their wife doesn't wear heels enough? /s
523,"You guys need to handle this like adults, you are going to be living together and avoiding him is not a solution. Hopefully you will be able to look back on this and laugh in the future.

525,My father is abusive and everyone who isn't a family member or close friend loves him. 
526,"I was waiting for your update, unfortunately this took a more dramatic turn than what I was expecting.

I think the best thing is to look for another job (which it seems you have already started) and cut off all contact in the meantime, besides if it relates strictly to work.

When you do find another job, you should consider telling this poor girl because I highly doubt that the sob story of ""can't leave her immediately because she would be too hurt"" is legitimate and is really just a bunch of bullshit and she deserves to know that the asshole she has been dating for eleven years is a creep.

You are in no way to blame, you had no idea. Heads up, you'll find someone who isn't a total asshole, I promise!"
527,Right?  Like up to 20 years of time
528,I guess I just needed validation that this was not normal.  The next time something like this happens I'll try telling Teddy that it's not okay and see how his parents react.  Their reaction will tell me all I need to know as to whether I will allow my son around theirs.
529,I am definitely this person. I love my own son and kiss him and show him tons of affection but other people's children make me uncomfortable for some reason. Almost like I'm intimidated by them? 
530,"Honestly, there's a lot of holier-than-thou racist implications going on with what he's saying. I'm sure he doesn't want to move not for OP's safety, but because it makes him look like he's ""connecting"" with his clients, when in reality, he will always be a step ahead and cannot admit that to himself. That's not true empathy for his clients. That's ego-stroking, and he'll never truly have experienced what his clients have. 

Being more worried about your ""credibility"" than your wife's, let alone your infant's safety, is a big concern."
531,"Why do you want to be with someone who calls you names and tries to degrade you over something it sounds like he enjoys himself (sex.... most humans like sex). 

It would be another ball game if he communicated maturely with you and explained his discomfort and tried to work around it with you. But he's being a disrespectful ass-hat and I'd be long gone if I were you."
532,"FYI, you probably already know this, but when he says ""not loyal"", he means ""you wouldn't put up with me being an asshole toward you"". Sorry, these particular friends are jerks, and you're better off without them as close friends."
533,"That's the main takeaway here. There's resentment in their relationship because they don't agree on finances. It's not a difference of income or something like that, but he legitimately does not respect her financial decisions (rightfully so), so there isn't really any compatibility. If she doesn't change, this is only going to get worse further down the road. "
534,"&gt; I just needed validation that this was not normal

Just to comment on your username, you are no being over protective at all. You are being protective and justifiably so. Children need to be protected, 2 year olds especially.

539,"Let's put it this way: would you rather overreact for nothing ... or underreact and get assaulted? Your intuition is SCREAMING at you. Listen to it!

Being rude is not the worst thing in the world (not that you're being rude). I'd rather hurt someone's feelings and stay safe than get hurt."
540,"So she did get you a gift for Mother's day? It sounds like you weren't satisfied with what she gave you. What expectations did you have from her? Does she even have money to buy you a gift with?

Also, about the stepmother thing, I didn't really buy my mom gifts as a teenager, my dad was in charge of that and we would give her the gift together, so it could just be that your ex is doing most of the work there. It doesn't mean your daughter is doing more for her."
541,"Of course! Make no mistake, this is an attempt to control your agency within the relationship. The comments about your family being 'happy' to loan you money, so why should he, is bizarre coming from someone who is supposed to be your partner. 

I think you need to take off the rose coloured glasses and admit that, yes, the age gap in your relationship is affecting things. He thinks he 'knows better'. If you're going to get married, you should know how much money he's making (even if the finances are separate). That is a hugely important factor in a life together, and his daddy issues shouldn't be used as an excuse to keep this in the dark from you. 

He's almost fifty, for fuck's sake. Daddy didn't love me doesn't get to be an excuse to hold a financial noose around your neck."
542,"First of all, even before you dump your bf, change doctors! There's no way that a specialist wouldn't have put you on treatment with a viral load of 75K. There is absolutely no reason to not start taking medication now. Please, please, go see another doctor and get on treatment. You know you'll have to be on it for life, most places will give it to you for free if you don't have insurance.

Has your bf been tested? have you always been safe? aside from his crazy beliefs, having 2 instances of pneumonia and a yeast infection can be indicatives of HIV infection. "
543,No you're not unreasonable. 
544,"Yeah, OP! Stop trying to get an apology from the horrible SIL and spineless brother. Your parents care more about them than you or your sister. You should probably try to get your sister in therapy and move out together if possible to get away from any future drama. That environment at home is not healthy for your sister and it can mentally destroy her if you keep trying to enable her to stick around your horrible family. "
545,"&gt; She's worried that the change in pace will do me more harm than good but I reminded her that I'm not disappearing completely and she's still going to see me at work five days a week.

I agree with the above commenter. This is where you should have chose to put up a boundary: ""Thank you but I think that's for me to worry about."" Instead of trying to reassure the person you've been emotionally cheating with, OP, you should be *distancing* yourself not just saying that you will. You've clearly made some effort but you need to make more."
546,"Honest male perspective here. Life experience has taught many a man that there is no point in trying to start a romantic and/or sexual relationship with a woman who is ""above"" him in terms of social status and success (degrees, companies, net worth, awards and recognition of talents/achievements, travel experience, social skills, human networks/connections, etc.).

We very quickly find out that women who have more going for themselves than we do, tend to have 0 interest in us and consider our interest annoying and creepy at best.

Since it takes quite some effort to ""woo"" a girl, we do not have the time or energy for pointless pursuits which we know are extremely likely to end in complete rejection.

So we self-select ourselves out of the competition for your heart, and instead focus on girls that are more ""matched"" in terms of status and success. Not because our ""insecure fragile male ego"" cannot handle a ""strong woman"", but because experience has taught us that such strong women do not respect men as equals in the dating game unless they are at least on the same level socially. And no woman is going to be interested in dating a man that she doesn't respect. 

We know from experience that when we approach a woman above us, she sees us as a boy and/or a subordinate. Any possibility for sexual tension is immediately quenched. But when we approach a woman on our level (or below), she can see us as a man. There is potential for sexual tension there.

We men did not make these ""rules"". They are not even rules, but observations and experiences. We may not even like this reality. Plenty of men get tired of always having to fight to be on top of life or else be a romantic reject. Plenty of men wish to date taller girls, highly succesful women, etc. - and find that the vast majority of girls will have none of that. It's not the kind of relationship women seem to want.

Men did not make these ""rules"". But we know this is how it is, and we have to deal with it. So we self-select ourselves out of the race for women above us. If tomorrow all girls would suddenly start rejecting men above them, and fawning over boys below them, then men would all start living in cardboard boxes and begging for money on the street while trying to play a song on a hobo harmonica but failing due to not being particularily musically gifted. But as it is right now, it's the male rock star who gets all the groupies. Meanwhile, [the female rock star hardly gets any action](http://www.salon.com/2011/02/22/neko_case_male_groupies/), because there are hardly any men higher up on the ladder:

&gt;Most women stars I know are busy screwing male stars and guys in their band

A similar thing happens to tall girls. Experience has taught men that they tend to get rejected unless they are at least a few cm taller than the girl they approach. Yes, there are *some* exceptions, but the trend is clear and is a well established scientific fact. {Edit: [someone asked for evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mj45l/i_32f_am_constantly_being_told_im_just/d3wq8z5)} So the tall girls get less attention, because men know the most likely outcome of an approach is to be ridiculed.

Men IRL may be reluctant to tell you about this, because they are likely to get belittled with the ""fragile male ego"" insults. But this has little to do with egos and a lot with practicality. As the woman in the current top comment describes:

&gt;(2) the guys who actually did like me and thought I was intimidating were probably guys I didn't want to date anyway.

Another example of the same female sentiment in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mj45l/i_32f_am_constantly_being_told_im_just/d3vzv8a). 

&gt;I very much wore the pants in the relationship. I hated it. It took me a while but I pretty much found the biggest asshole in my profession, and we started dating. In truth he found me. I guess he is the one guy who isn't intimidated by me. He respects my independence and my successes. And he is just as intimidating as I am.

So indeed, most women are in fact not interested in guys below them (both literally and in terms of status). So if you are a woman high up on the ladder, most of the guys below you will opt themselves out, and the ones that don't are still not appealing to you. What's left are the maybe 10% of guys even further up the ladder than you. Indeed, many comments here are giving you the advice to look for [super hot and accomplished guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mj45l/i_32f_am_constantly_being_told_im_just/d3w0ds6) and to [date ""way, way up"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mj45l/i_32f_am_constantly_being_told_im_just/d3w6d1x)

But guess what: success and status tend to make a man very attractive to many other women. So those 10% of men can drown in female attention if they want to, and they don't mind getting attention from the girls ""below"" them. The male doctor will date the female nurse, but the female doctor often won't date the male nurse. That is the root of your problem, because you are now competing with the entire female population (of eligible age) for this small fraction of top men. So you may end up dating a doctor that you consider the perfect match, but he will also be considered the perfect match by hordes of other girls. So you are very unlikely to get monogamous commitment from him.

The only real solution would be, if we somehow got rid of the female tendency to only fall for men above them. But that is not going to happen. So the market will be the market, and it is indeed possible to prize yourself out of it.

This story can sometimes be a little too honest, blunt, coldly analytical, or frank for common conversation, which is why it often gets dressed up in carefully cushioned but vague phrases such as ""you may be too intimidating"". But here you have my dissection of what that actually concretely means in a broader context. Good luck."
547,"I think they meant, given that the Dad is in a non-gender-stereotypical profession surely he'd be a bit more open-minded on what it means to ""be a man""..."
548,"Really? The doctor told them that he wasn't eligible, but it's *your* job to somehow fix this? Even if you were inclined to help, what exactly could you even do? And after how he treated you, your father's got to have a pair of brass ones to expect you to fight and advocate like that on his behalf.

I'm glad you're seeing a therapist soon. Focus on yourself and take all the time you need to heal. Best of luck!"

Give no indication that you might. Be INCREDIBLY clear that you will NOT, under ANY circumstances be playing happy families with her, that you will contest paternity with a court ordered test, and IF its yours, you will pay the minimum legally possible support and have no contact whatsoever with her or the child.

She may then decide to abort.

550,"I love to drink. I get trashed.

I have never in my life taken a secret spy video of someone using the bathroom or showering. Funny how no matter how drunkenly I fumble with my iPhone that never happens.  Especially twice.

And I've never drunkenly edited videos, either. 

He's a sexual predator, and he's really disgusting. Dump him. There's no way he didn't set up his phone ... TWICE..  on purpose to invade your sister's privacy so he could jerk off to her nude body. And he obviously edited the films for the best parts. 

And he's gaslighting you!  That's mentally and emotionally abusive!

If you stay with him, you're going to start doubting your own memories and ability to know what is going on, and he's going to keep spying on your sister and maybe other women. "
551,"Explain to them that you've been training for years and prefer sparring with people who are more experienced. Also, start asking them questions about it that might intimidate them. Use a lot of technical MMA terms that they wouldn't understand when asking them how they like to fight."
552,"Seems like Gaby may have lied to them about having your dad living with you guys and/or in a relationship with your mom.
It's her relationship with her parents, not your relationship with her or your relationship with HER parents that's at risk here. She needs to deal with it, be honest with them. You're right not to expect your mom to go solo nor to lie for you to them - honesty is the best policy here.

You can ask her to tell her parents the truth, gauge their reaction and see whether or not it's even safe (emotionally) for your mom to be at their house at all. Maybe they will surprise their daughter? Don't lie, don't feed into lies, don't continue any lies. It will only make this much, much harder than it has to be. If they're rabidly homophobic that's on them, not you or Gaby. They might be pissed at her for lying to them though."

559,"My long term ex (4 years!) did this to me too. Suspiciously soon after we broke up he was dating his ""best friend"". It hurt like hell and really altered the way I saw him as a person, and the way we handled the break up going forward. 

We had been civil post-breakup, and after that came out, I could no longer be civil.  I cut him out full stop. What I did not do was exact revenge. You can be the bigger person (which 100% sucks. Adulting sucks.). 

Now, if his parents ever asked you of their own volition, I don't think you need to keep his secrets. He doesn't deserve your protection. But don't run off to them to tattle. He'll probably get the money anyway, once the dust settles.

560,"There are other witnesses to back you up, it only takes one person to break the ice, no one else is going to deny it when it was so obvious. In fact, I'm sure she's going to be angry with everyone that *didn't* immediately come forward to talk to her, because that shit is a major betrayal. There were so many witnesses that this is *going* to come out. Be on the right side when it does. Staying silent means she will never trust you again."

573,"This could easily turn into an episode of Law and Order. I'd remove all contact and let everyone close to you know how potentially unstable she is.

Seriously, $200 is NOTHING for an adult with a job. And the fact that the difference between $50 and $100 is a huge deal to you is also quite worrying. It sounds like the two of you should really get your finances in order before you think about getting married."
581,"Your boyfriend knowing the truth isn't ""making the situation worse"".

You seem to think that if you suffering in silence will spare people around you pain. It's noble, but also very foolish. You are hurting (because someone hurt you) and are making decision based on this hurt and also your safety that is effecting not only you but people around you. You are not suffering in silence! You are suffering in plain view of other people who don't understand why you won't let them help you and feel bad that they can't be there for you.

582,"Wait until they contact you and let them know you are disappointed with how they treated you.  

Reiterate that you were glad to help!  But that their behavior and conduct left you feeling (however you felt leaving that encounter - upset, frustrated, angry).  Also tell them you're taking a breather and will reach out when you're ready to work on your friendship.  

Then do that.  Give it some time and space.  If they apologize, consider that apology and accept it if you can.  I have a gut feeling that they will probably deny and minimize their poor behavior which, if they do, drop them.

I have a near non-existent relationship with my mother, and has been tense at best otherwise for the past 17 years.  However I was also the same age she was when she had me when I had my first child. It was easier and is still easier on some levels to understand some of the life choices she made, both good and shitty as I mature and age. 

Now, I think we're getting closer to an olive branch on some amicable level.. though in very, very, small baby steps.  But once I realized how/why she made some of those decisions, they were mostly because she was having issues of her own, not because I was to blame. 

Edit: Bajeesus. I just realized I'm the same age as OP's mother and OP 2 years older than my first child. I think it's worth it to just... hear each other out as an adult to an adult not as a parent/child.  Again, cautiously.  I also live out of state with my kids and I had limited time with my kids since they lived with their father and his crazy ex-wife.

It's past time to put your foot down with your kids, and let them know that this behavior on their part *will not be tolerated*.

I would be quite surprised if this guy hadn't already either molested a kid or been viewing child porn.   IDK what moves you should make but to be honest it is extremely optimistic if not outright naive to assume he is telling you the truth about this and hasn't already hurt someone's kid."

590,Seconded. This sounds like it's escalating into an extremely dangerous situation for OP.
591,"You sound like you have two separate issues: your family and your husband.

With the family, it sounds like these are people who it might benefit you to just go no contact with. If they're not bringing anything beneficial to your life, why continue to be tormented by them by keeping in touch? You are not obligated to be in contact with them. Definitely don't say anything or mention it unless they explicitly ask. Be very vague in your responses unless you want to share. They're not entitled to personal details about your life.

This being said, your husband doesn't necessarily need to know either. I'd 100% get a lawyer (consultations are generally free, from what I have heard but IANAL) and start planning to leave without him knowing. If he's on heroin and other hardcore drugs, his behavior will be unpredictable and erratic. You might want to call a police officer on the non-emergency line or a women's shelter and ask for someone to assist in monitoring you as you move out for protection. He will find out when he is served and honestly it might be best not to provoke a man who is known to be a liar and dabbling in hardcore drugs. 

I'm sorry you're going through this OP"

599,"Honey....your mom needed you to bail her out of jail...that's not normal.

She caused you serious drama, embarrassed you in front of your boss and then attacked you and created more drama.  What does she add to your life that is positive?

My advice is to let her cut contact and get yourself some therapy.  She will come screaming back into your life demanding money so don't worry about her disappearing.  Go enjoy your vacation and ""forget"" your phone.  

Oh and check out r/raisedbynarcissists  and Alanon to learn how to protect yourself and set up boundaries."
600,"What kind of reactions does she think she'll face? For practical matters, if she's financially dependent on them and thinks they'll cut her off I can understand her issue. This sub always advises people to keep their head down until they're financially independent.

601,I think you should end it. There is no point in having a partner that won't help you through the hard times.
602,"&gt; How do you tell someone you love that you would pick a living location over being with them?

Its not necessarily that you are picking a location over her. You two are just going different places in life. She wants to be married and have kids and it sounds like ASAP. You want to work, have fun, and be in an interesting place. You are not the first person to come to this cross roads and you definitely won't be the last.

Don't worry about how she will feel because its not your life goal to make this other person happy at the expense of your own happiness. She will be able to find someone else who can give her what she wants and be happy doing it.

Don't worry about being selfish. When all is said and done the only person looking 100% out for you is you. So you need to take steps to make sure you're happy, fulfilled, and on the path you want to be on.

It's been 2 years so the least you can do is do it in person. Meet up with her and just tell her that you two are going in different directions and going down her path isn't where you want to go in life."

606,"""The pot is scratched"" does not sound like a complaint to me.  Neither does ""The water tastes different"" or ""the cicadas sound weird here.""

Why do you take them as complaints?

A scratched Teflon pot needs to be replaced.  The water DOES taste different from place to place, and the pitch of a cicada's wings is different sometimes on the West Coast than the East.  

So, you need to go to anger management to learn how to better deal with stuff that irritates you (and how to recognize when being irritated by it is the wrong choice).

Before the trip, you should sit down with your girlfriend and say ""There are going to be times when I'm going to need to take a walk alone for a couple of hours, and it's not because I don't love you, it's because being on  my own resets my brain so that I'm not cranky.""  And then when  you DO take those breaks, it needs to not be ""AAAH, you're pissing me off so much! I'll be back when I'm back!"" it needs to be ""Ok, I'm going to take one of those breaks we talked about, and I'll be at (place) at (time). Love you!""

&gt;How can I teach myself to say, without starting an argument, ""Yes, the water is different. Please stop talking about it""? 

Yeah, that's kinda fucking rude of you. You don't teach yourself to find kinder ways to change her harmless behaviors, you teach yourself to not get irritated by them."
607,There is nothing here to suggest a court will enforce supervised contact. In fact there is nothing to suggest that she won't get joint custody if she wants it. So there's no need to worry about telling your in laws about something that exists solely in your imagination.
608,"Do you live in the area? Take him out. You can't fix your parents' thoughtlessness, but you can certainly make up for yours!"

Sure she did it for EVERY piece of news. She's used to it.  a twin is way closer to their twin sibling than most of us could imagine o it's only natural for her to instinctively react like this.

614,"Honestly, I don't care what happens I would never leave something out there that could screw up my chance of losing my career path."
615,"It isn't fair of them to be *angry* with you about it, but you have to understand, when you move on from a period of life, you often *really* move on, even if it was a happy time. I loved raising my kids, but that was twenty years of work and I have no desire to go back to it. I love my downsized empty-nest life! And, you know, the family home isn't always as fond for a parent as it is for children. When you're a parent, your home is often built around the kids' needs more than yours, and you just kind of make do on your own needs and wants sometimes. So the empty-nest home is sometimes the home you *really* wanted, sometimes for the first time. Not everyone wants to go home again, y'know? Your post comes across a bit as if you just assumed everyone was going to want to go and re-live your childhood there, which is a bit different to just, ""Hey, I bought the old house."" And that may not be a realistic expectation to have."
616,"Listen to this. This is sexual harassment and a hostile work environment.

You might also want to see if you can file harassment charges with the police."
617,"Well, the sensitivity sounds... intense. I think you have been letting these feelings fester, and you need to sit him down and have a direct conversation about all of this. How he reacts can inform you if you want to stay in the relationship. 

You need to tell him that his constantly asking ""what's wrong"" makes you think there *is* something wrong. Ask him why he asks that in response to benign statements. Listen to what he says. Push him to articulate (by either staying silent until he talks more, or asking deeper questions, whatever seems appropriate) if he doesn't expand right away. Ask him why he feels upset so often. Is it your tone? Is it a past relationship influencing his behavior? etc. 

With the snuggling you should just lay down the boundaries. Explain you're an introvert (I'm sure he knows this) and that means you need time alone. Like, without him, alone. He should be able to respect that. 

You should also discuss your different cuddle thresholds. Reiterate that you enjoy the physical side of the relationship, but that frequent cuddling can feel overwhelming. I'm the cuddler in my relationship, and to fulfill my higher ""cuddle drive"" I got a pet cat. Maybe a pet is an option for him. 

I would separate it into two convos... 1) about the sensitivity and 2) about personal space. Otherwise he'll feel like you've been building up all these issues to pile on him at once. You know him, but the personal space conversation is probably the easier one, and so that's the one I would lead with a few weeks before the other. "
618,"To me, it depends on what he said and how he said it. Being high, wearing PJs and buying snacks that are obviously for the munchies, all combined can appear pretty trashy. Perhaps he was worried about seeing someone from work/school, his landlord/neighbours, a family member, who knows? If he said ""hey, I'm not going out with you unless you put some pants on"", I think that is understandable. If he said ""you're an embarrassment, I wouldn't be seen dead with you in public like that you skank. Put some makeup on too while you're at it"" then that is not cool."
619,"I'm the thinnest person in an office full of overweight women who think everyone should suffer because of how much they hate their own bodies. It won't change. Nothing you say will make it change. They will just gossip about how you think you're better than they are and how you're a bitch or too sensitive or whatever. Eat what you want, make friends with the thin lady, and ignore these women. They are a level of pathetic you could never hope to achieve even with your most dedicated efforts."
620,"Except she really can't kick him out unless she wants to go to jail.

That said, if you want to take him in now, then go for it.  Consider getting him into therapy too, because I am guessing he is going to have some abandonment issues."
621,"Not just bad memories; it also makes her think about the ""what ifs"" of her boyfriend dying in a sudden accident ...not a pleasant thought to ponder."
622,"If two people are in a relationship and agree that certain things are not allowed, and one person does it behind the other persons back, thats cheating. Some couples include porn. Some more insane couples include talking to members of the opposite sex. Some couples will allow sex with others but kissing will be considered cheating. Every relationship is different.

In your case, she did something that she would have considered cheating had you have done it, thus you should consider it cheating just the same."
623,"Look, he can afford a lawyer. Please do everything you can to encourage him to get one, or at least call one for a phone consult, *now.* After the court appearance will be too late. This is not a situation he can afford to play by ear, and you can't assume that the appearance will go well because he ""didn't do anything."" For pete's sake, he was just arrested for breaking a picture frame. Can you not get the hint? *This is not something to fool around with or take casually.* And from your two posts there is *no* reason to rely on your sister's assurances that she will testify favorably. 

He. Needs. A. Lawyer.

624,"Just so you're prepared, he will probably pout and try to paint you as being ""too sensitive"" or otherwise irrational about it. Do not listen.

Him: Woah, woah! Calm down! What's your problem!  
You: I want you to stop touching me.  
Him: It's just tickling, it doesn't mean anything!  
You: I need it to stop.  
Him: You've never had a problem before!  
You: I have told you *repeatedly* to stop.  
Him: Yeah, but-  
You: I do not want you to touch me. Do you understand?

Do not justify yourself, defend your position, or explain why you don't want to be touched. You do not owe anyone an explanation. "
625,"This is serious, and you need to do these 2 things immediately:

I thought it sounded crazy but it's so much better to wake up between 8:00-8:30 when I'm ready vs 8:30 every day when I'm not. I use sleep cycle maybe this is a possibility for her. 
629,"&gt;Sure we wanted to go to college in the States but if my sister didn't want us it's not like we would hold a grudge against her. We would have packed our things and left with my parents.

&gt;if we could legally live on our own then we would just do that but we can't.

This is the whole point. You can't live on your own and she is doing you a massive life altering favor.

&gt;my parents don't think very highly of my sister, probably why she took us in. ...

&gt;They said that they knew Frank would take care of us anyways and that my sister lacked the discipline to care for anyone but herself.

&gt;They really like Frank, they were against him initially but he quickly showed his true colors and they have since accepted him with open arms into our family.

&gt;They were very cruel but everything they said was 200% true about my sister. 

&gt; I don't want to be mean but it doesn't even seem like my sister deserves someone like him

Do you realize how judging you are being of your sister in these comments? It sounds like you don't even think of/treat your sister like family, you treat Frank like family. Instead of looking at your own actions that could have caused issues, you instead think of course Lily is the problem.
You also said that 

&gt;It started great at first, we spent time together and as she said we were growing our sisterly bond that was missed when we were growing up. But, over time she became more and more strict and started to complain a lot more. I think she grew tired of us or she was trying to fake her kindness because like I said she has never been close to us and we're both pretty sure she might dislike us.

Did you ever consider that she did want you there? Maybe she just caught onto the fact that you don't and will never think of her family, that you don’t think highly of her and that you don't respect her at all. (edit: read some of ops comments to see what I mean) She opened her house to you, had fun and small talked, she held out the olive branch if you will, to the three of you sisters becoming closer but if you speak to her like you do in the comments its going to sour that relationship quite quickly. 

I am not saying that verbal abuse or passive aggression are ok. But I am urging you to see if you have contributed to this problem, and to look for solutions. If you think Korea is a viable option and you don't mind going there you and your sister should seriously consider moving there because it would be to everyone's benefit. "

You've got a drug problem and it's pretty clear from the way you are writing that you need help, not grounded help, but rehab help.  Perhaps a compromise is in order.  Talk to your parents about going into rehab, after you get back from the funeral that you will attend with your grandparents.   This is fair compromise you get the real help you need and you get to say goodbye to Jessica.   

If I were in your position I would ask to get put into rehab and I would deliberately miss Jessica's funeral, because I was in rehab.   Jessica gave you up due to her drug problems, and she probably didn't want you to have the same problem she had, she probably would be happier if you were clean and sober rather than using, and missing her funeral due to your own drug problem should be rock bottom and a wake up call for you. Life is inconvenient, and sometimes you need to make a hard decisions when you don't want to, you need to start thinking about **YOUR** priorities, if being sober is a priority then you need to make the right decisions to get and stay sober.  If being sober isn't a priority then you need move out of your parents house and stop burdening them with you priorities.  "

649,"Even if there is nothing going on and it's totally appropriate behaviour, often in life it's not about you but what people perceive about you. Being a teacher, who has power and authority over children, means you have a public profile wether you want to or not. Having all these young female students posting things about him, and interacting on his page, could likely lead to people perceiving that he has been/is in appropriate with his students. Does he have male students as friends on Facebook as well? If not that's even worse. 

He can be ""right"" and still be wrong. The road he's going down is a dangerous one. Even a rumour of a teacher acting inappropriate with a student can ruin his career. Even if it's not true. "

651,"The best way to stop a negative pattern, whatever that pattern is, is to shut it down right at the beginning.


Tom has to be the one to bend first here. He's an adult, with an adult's reasoning skills, an adult's experience, and an adult's emotional intelligence. So it's up to him to change first.


I think you should talk to him again and to agree to stop complaining about all the kids. The key word here is complaining: having a discussion about them is fine, talking about things they did wrong/when they were misbehaving/things that need to be addressed is fine.


But Tom is an adult and he should be able to comprehend the difference between talking and complaining. And he needs to stop complaining about Julie, because it's a problem. Frame it as stopping complaining about them all, because that's a good habit, but really this is to address his attitude about Julie. 


So when he starts, ask him to stop. Ask him to re-frame what he's saying and thinking as a conversation, as a discussion, and not as a complaint. *Stop letting him roast Julie for 45 minutes*. Seriously, why are you even listening to him spend a lot of time complaining about her? 


Don't force them to spend time one-on-one. He doesn't like the idea, she doesn't like the idea - you need to compromise on this one and let it go. Their relationship will improve, but you don't want to force it. 


Get him a book or two on parenting teenagers. 14 year old girls are little assholes. It will help him to understand that it's nothing personal - that's just how it is. Maybe even seek out books that explain the physical development of a teenager's brain and the different hormonal factors that influence their behavior. Basically anything that lets him know he's not alone.


Okay, with that in mind: let's assume that all worked and Tom has softened and compromised in his approach to her. 


With Julie, you need to take a harder line on her behavior toward him. Show Tom that, although you won't let him spend forever bitching about her, you also won't let her get away with being bitchy to him. If she's doing things to piss him off deliberately, that shit stops now. She's 14, not 4. Yes, it's a difficult time in her life, but that's no excuse for treating others poorly. If she treats him badly and is deliberately defiant, those behaviors are not okay. I'm surprised that you phrase things this way: 


&gt;She treats him badly. She does things to piss him off deliberately. She won't open up to him and she doesn't talk to him. He's basically acting like she's rejected him so he doesn't have to try anymore. I reminded him that he's the grown up and needs to keep trying, and he just blows that off.


She treats him poorly... but you continue the paragraph by talking about him? What are the consequences for her behavior? What steps are you taking so that she knows this isn't going to be tolerated?


This is a tough situation. 14 year old girls are tough! Step dads are tough! Your husband needs to bend first, but Julie needs to get her attitude in line as well. "
652,"You're way over analyzing this. You haven't talked to him much, you say in the comments you think he's attractive, and he's interested in at least being friends with you, so just keep talking to him, ask him a question or two about himself, and see where it goes. 

The vibe I'm getting from you after reading all the comments so far is that you're interested in him but are scared because of awful parents and other people in your life calling you ugly. You need to work on your confidence, whether or not anything happens with this guy. Your self depreciation is depressing and will not be beneficial later in life. "
653,"Even tho its shitty for the puppy dog like a lot of pet owners they don't actually care.  Get her to buy a large lockable crate with a feeding and water tray which the puppy must be placed in until house trained.  Also request this in a registered letter to her.

If she refuses tell her you are starting to take pictures of the damage and will start reporting it to the landlord, and if you don't receive your full deposit back due to the damage of the dog you will be taking her to court to get said deposit.

i don't feel bad in my judgement. abandoning your children has to be the most selfish, prickish, assholish things a person can emotionally do to a child. those kids didn't ask to be his firsts. 

and your sister is no winner either. she's accepting this behavior from him. she should be helping him foster a relationship with his children despite whatever relationship he has with their mother. no, she's being a selfish POS too.

and then what happens when he leaves her? it's not like there isn't a history of him leaving his family. i guess it's easier to not want to seem judgmental when it's not your nieces/nephews.

His loss of temper and subsequent violence are his fault, not yours.

For the love of god, pack and get out of there, at least for tonight. You need to start making plans for how to get out of there permanently.

671,"&gt;I also want to say that my parents aren't all to blame. I can be jerk sometimes. I'm really good at being mean in arguments and a lot of our incidents have started with me being sarcastic and ended with my dad punching something. I don't want to use my parents as an excuse for my own bad behaviors and I don't want to become anything like them.

You being sarcastic or occasionally petty does not in any way whatsoever excuse or justify your parents being violent, mean, and cruel. Nothing that they've done is your fault. They failed as parents, completely and utterly. You didn't do anything wrong except *exist*.

I hope things continue to improve with you, though. If you do end up going to college, pick the one with the most expensive tuiton you can get away with just to poke em a little. :P "

674,"Yes, precisely.

OP, why the fuck didn't you try to see your kids? Get a lawyer and seek visitation/custody? You knew they were at your SIL's; you could have arranged to see them. You sound like an awful father who didn't give a fuck his kids were out of his life because he could fuck some strange."

Call CPS. You and the kids need to tell them everything that's been going on (current situation and past). If you are willing to take the kids, a social worker should be able to help you get it all figured out and get social services for the kids while you are taking care of them (it's called kinship care in California). If you are not, then your siblings might end up in foster care or end up back with your mother  with visits from a social worker to check up on them. "

These are not just occasional blips, OP says it seems he writes letters on a weekly basis. I can't imagine just hiding that much hostility back in the box among the jewelry and forgetting about it. It needs to be discussed. Maybe OP's husband actually loves her very much but can't bring himself to raise touchy subjects, so he's become fixated on them. They need to talk IMO. "
681,"&gt; You need to consider that her answer was probably based on the fear of a breakup

I'm worried about that too, its why I told her to take as much time as she needs to think it over and not decide on the spot.

In many ways we already do almost live together.  She has her own house, but she spends an equal amount of time at my house and about 50% of nights.   She will be moving to live with me full-time now, which I think is good for the reasons you mentioned.  Of course, she won't be doing anything rash such as selling her own house, in case, like you mentioned, it turns out it won't work out.  Thank you very much for your wishes, best to you too."
682,"I disagree with most of the comments here. There's nothing wrong with your BF having opposite gender friendships, but the fact that he hid it from you this long means he knew it was on some level not above board and intentionally kept it from you. AND he told you while you were drunk, not while you were sober, stable, and rational, and could process it peacefully, with most likely exaggerated and dishonest terms. How could you have reacted in any way other than shittily?

You have insecurity problems, its true, but what's also true is so many of /r/relationships posts are around opposite gender best friends being some kind of dealbreaker. Add to that sexual history, and you've got a recipe for jealousy and insecurity that even the most trusting of monogamous couples can't recover from. I would argue that its your debilitating insecurity that *doesn't* see how poorly your BF handled this situation.

I would leave him over this, not because I'm insecure about BF and his best friend's relationship, but because I'm not sure I could trust BF not to pull another one over me like that. But you should think about what *you* need to fix that trust -- whether it be an honest conversation over sexual history or cutting the best friend out completely -- because IMO that lack of trust is what fuels so much of the insecurity and anxiety you're experiencing."

Wow. 

OP, I am amazed you have been able to watch this over the years. Now, she is turning it on you. You aren't flaunting, you aren't walking out in your panties doing a show, just sweats and a tee. It is your home too. You have every right to do what you want in your home.

He needs to show that he can be responsible and contribute consistently *before* you get a place together. 

And just because you're privileged (and it's good that you recognize it) doesn't mean you owe anyone else anything. It's nice that your parents supported you so you could graduate and start adulthood debt free. It doesn't mean that you have to pay anyone else's way though. "

692,I am sorry this happened to you. I really am. I have been in bad relationships before. You are not at fault for trusting him and you are not a dirty person for being tricked. He is 100% at fault. He is the one who has to answer for that shit and the one who needs to be 100% kicked in morals.

Letting Mom establish a huge chasm is a terrible idea. You don't support it. There are more sibs than one parent and all the sibs want to go. Ignore her and set it up.

Btw, people can express grief in weird ways. I think that's what this is. Possibly you should explain to the half sibs that Mom feels weird and you think it's a form of grieving? That she said your Dad was gone and so she had no connection left to them? Do you think they could help with that? BUT don't say in advance unless you have to because she's acting so oddly, try to discuss it on vacation. Unfortunately unless Mom fall in line right away I think you are going to have to mention it. But don't make it uncomfortable, make it like: Mom's doing some odd things, she's treating some things and people oddly and we really need to help her straighten this out. Say you are really looking forward to seeing them, etc., make it clear that they are your family without actually saying that but make them feel close, okay?

And get that halfsib another present for her birthday!

Just keep reminding Mom you are all a family and explain that Dad passing on does not make her not a stepmom, she still is a stepmother!

Remind her that Dad would want her to carry on with the family for ALL of you, together.

Remind her how nice they are and how much they still depend on her and want her to do things with them.

Tell her they ARE YOUR immediate family, you are related to them by blood!

If she continues to be weird, I think you have to take her to therapy and go in with her and explain the problem. Possibly she needs some depression medication.

I don't see how she has the right to suddenly not allow your halfsibs to be at her house, which even if she inherited it all herself, she got it from your Dad with the clear expectation that ALL his kids would be welcome there."

Yeah... according to her. You have no idea if what she is telling you is the truth, or whether it is simply self-preserving manipulation by someone who neglected and abused the man you love when he was just a helpless little boy. He knows her far, far, far better than you ever will. 


Especially since it seems she has a history of lying and playing the victim and downplaying her abuse of her son - you done fucked up.  You went behind his back and shared HUGE news with her that you should've shared with him first.  That kind of breach of trust is hard to recover from in a relationship.


Come clean about everything with him, let him know that you are 100% on his side, and that you will let him take the lead when it comes to contact with his mother.  There is a very good chance he will not want his son or daughter to be around his mother and you need to honor his wishes unless you want things to really go past the point of no return here."
702,"He's scared you're going to break up with him because he knows he's an asshole. Reassure him that if you've put up with his nonsense (ask yourself if this is the only situation where he violates your boundaries) so far, it proves you do love him and aren't about it leave him over this (PS: I think you should) but only if from now on, like right this second, he starts to respect you.  
This means not attempting to control you in any shape or form, or you're out.  
This means not trying to belittle you for looking good or liking how you look, or you're out.  
This means relinquishing his unauthorized access to your electronics and online accounts (he should do this in front of you), as well as making separate accounts if you share any - and take your gadgets to be scanned for any software/hardware he may have installed immediately, even if he claims to have removed everything (do this every two weeks for a couple of months at least). Change all your passwords everywhere.  
This means taking tangible steps to better himself as a person and a partner - such as personal therapy or counseling as a couple, these are just broad suggestions because you really haven't said anything about the dynamics of your relationship - or you're out.   

Is there a reason (besides ""I really love him"") why you are so determined to continue to work on this relationship, when the effort is clearly one-sided? I mean, what would be the immediate consequences of breaking up? Are you dependent on him in some material way? "
703,"This was my first thought too. He's told his friends and family they're trying, he just hasn't told the woman he's actually trying to impregnate. That coupled with his insitance that she can just give up her schooling and forget marriage for now makes me think he's made up his mind that he should get her pregnant now.

I wonder what else is going on in the relationship. You say he earns enough to support the two of you. Is he in some way nervous that you'll leave once you've got your masters? Are you going to eventually out earn him? Are you planning to pick a career which requires travel?

It just seems really surprising that he wants to get pregnant NOW rather than wait to finish your schooling and get married. You're still young, the urgency is surprising."

Get over yourself and for a few hours be a part of your child's memory.  They grow up faster than you think.  When they get of adult age, or even now...right now... if your kid asked why you're not going next week, and your answer as to ""hey mom, why weren't you at any of my championships or going to my invitational meet next week?

728,"Designer who works with artist logos regularly - for the sake of design, sometimes they need to be changed - *especially* if you're dealing with low-res imagery, or, as you stated in your post a clashing color scheme. At that point, however, there are design guidelines regarding what colors a logo should be in, etc.

In my opinion, you're not necessarily in the wrong, but there is some learning to be had. While you may not have had confidence you would receive the logo in time, you should have contacted John and Amy to at least request it, then followed up with her and voiced your concern. The fact that you didn't even bother because you thought they would be untimely isn't ok - moving forward, you need to make every reasonable effort to retrieve original files.

Also, and take a look at other flyers for this one, when adding a logo to a flyer, you want to try to keep the color scheme and design to a minimum around that area. That might mean pulling a gradient down over a pattern so there aren't any clashing shapes when you layer the logo on top, for instance.

Just learn from this and move forward. Your friend over reacted about the situation, but you could have also made a better effort to get the original logo as well.

Best of luck!"

I'll bet you the threat of that much massive amount of embarrassment will have them all back pretty quick. If not, you follow through and you'll probably still get them all back since I'm sure the rest of his friends will be horrified.

732,"I have to say I agree with you a fair amount here.

I mean, I get venting about things on paper when you're annoyed by an SO. It's therapeutic. But there were two things in her examples that gave me pause - namely the one about how she's lucky she's good in bed, and how he wanted to tell her to shove it up her ass when she asked for his assistance in a household chore.

There's being annoyed, and there's lacking respect. Those two things make this feel like the latter. 

I know I annoy my SO, but I also know that he wouldn't ever address me (in his mind/privately or out loud) in that manner. I would never think of him that way either. Assuming those are direct quotes from the letters, the verbiage makes my skin crawl."

His pride, in this situation, was more important to him than your personal comfort (he probably logically knew that a tent/air mattress would be more comfortable).

750,"Your ex sounds pretty bitter and exhausting, BUT I've read lots of threads of these types (divorced dad dating hot young thing, ex-wife angry) and I gotta say that it's hard to believe you aren't kind of showing off here. Hear me out!

I'm divorced. My ex-husband and I are amicable. I'm in a relationship now with a younger man (not too terribly younger, but still). My ex is alone. 

However, I'd never dream of telling my ex all the things my BF and I do that my ex and I didn't. I'm not interested in rubbing it in his face that my BF is handsomer and more romantic and more whatever. I don't divulge our activities. I don't let on that I am a far better partner to BF than I was to him (because I was unhappy, and that went both ways). It wasn't even your ex's idea to meet your GF, it was yours, so I wonder if you are kind of bragging to your ex while maintaining this veneer of plausible deniability. 

Again, NOT saying your ex is right to say these things. But for God's sake, put her on an information diet regarding your life and your GF. Like someone else said, your conversations should be about the kids. 

I feel for the exes in these situations. It always stings when your ex-partner gets this new squeeze and proceeds to do everything with them that you begged them to do with you for years. If my ex got a GF and proceeded to be the man I always dreamed of to her, it would STILL sting even though I am happily coupled because I would know that he COULD HAVE been that way with me, he just CHOSE not to be. And I am sensitive to that fact about myself too, therefore I do not inform my ex of any of these things. "
751,"Completely agree. I'm more appalled at the parents who keep insisting they go to this ""wedding"" (I'm more inclined to call it a shitshow at this point) and expose OP's sister to more ridicule. 

FSIL has made it obvious that not only is she not going to apologize for past behavior but has no qualms about creating drama with her future in-laws. Going to the wedding just validates that not only is her behavior acceptable, it can continue because OP's spineless parents care more about appearances. "

I can't emphasize this enough. My mother never spoke ill of my father growing up, but he really liked bringing up irrelevant shit from the past (from when she was a teenager no less) and complaining about her. Even from a young age I realized it was bitter nonsense, and eventually I got sick of it and basically told him to shut up about it if he wanted to keep seeing me. OP, if you continue to be the loving father they deserve, they will recognize that.

It's unfair and awful that they're exposed to this, but sadly that's just how some people are."
754,"Nope.  Sorry.  He's being an asshole.  And you are not being a ""princess"" (ew).

I had a boyfriend who did exactly the same things, and it totally screwed with my sleep schedule (which also screwed with my appetite, and my energy, and my mood, and just everything).  Every guy I've been with since has been completely respectful of my bedroom/sleep time rules.

I think you may have some good advice already about how to deal with him, but I think we also need to address mommy's weirdness too. He married her when you were how old? Her silence on this issue is just as creepy as his intrusiveness."
756,"Damn dude. That all went downhill very very quickly. I'll just be honest though, she wanted marriage after 8 years together. I can understand why because after 8 years, you don't think a relationship that long is that easy to throw away. She made up her mind that she wanted to be with you forever and your reaction to it made her think you don't want the same. You even said it yourself. I completely understand why she's devastated. You were so quick to sleep with another woman which just makes you look like an asshole honestly. If I had a girlfriend for that long, I'd be more than happy to marry her since I wouldn't be able to see my life with anyone else. This is your fault dude. You were so quick to leave out other options and you didn't even think of bringing her with you to your dad."
757,"You should ask yourself why you're considering meeting with him in the first place. You're not interested in a relationship, and you barely know him. Do you just feel obligated because he randomly decided to get on a plane? If so, that's not your problem. I agree with everyone else that this his behavior is quite bizarre. Best case scenario, he's got a complete lack of social graces. Worst case scenario, well, he's a total creep. In either case, do you see this meeting turning into something--a relationship, a profound friendship, anything at all? If not, there's no point in meeting and you're under no obligation to do so."
758,"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. You are right to feel weird about this.

Send him a text message or email saying that you feel threatened and unsafe, and that you want him to leave you alone and not contact you, and that all further attention from him will be documented.

You need to document absolutely everything that happens with something that is time-and-date stamped. Best way to do this is to send yourself an email as quickly as you can after ANYTHING happens, describing the events and your feelings in the most newspaper way possible. 

My roommate in college escalated her crush on me to full-blown stalking, and my college wouldn't take my complaint seriously until I printed out extensive gchats to show her attention had always been unwanted.

You should also tell your supervisor at work what is happening and ask for his or her feedback. You should also tell your parents, not so that they can helicopter in to save you, but so that they can day-by-day help you evaluate the grown-up workplace and so that they can give you any resources you may need. And finally, you should tell your friends so that they can help run interference and keep you apart at social occasions. 

Look up ""The Gift of Fear."" If you feel unsafe, that's a feeling you should take very, very seriously."
759,"&gt; They have not even realized and I am not sure if I should even bother telling them.

So you expect your brother to tell his own parents they forgot his birthday? Give your brother a break and tell them, so they can be sure to make amends by getting him an amazing birthday present from Hawaii."
760,"&gt;Does it really affect people that much?  

and  

&gt;I feel like if he would have just told me and not lied about it then nothing would have changed

and 

&gt; We were grateful but those were such stress times that would have been so much less stressful had we known the full picture.


Look at the slow progression. You first said that you don't think anything would change and then later admitted that yeah, it would've made a difference (i.e. things would've changed). So ask yourself, if you knew he was wealthy and your brother needed his surgery, would you and your family expect money from him for the surgery (whether it be a gift or a payment plan). If you think no, you don't expect to, why would it be less stressful for your family unless it is because he is wealthy? If your original comment is your true feelings, then yes, knowing he was wealthy would've made an impact on your relationship and it changes the dynamic and expectations.   
  

Now put yourself in your boyfriend's shoes. His previous relationships with people were affected because people wanted easy money from him at worst, or thought of him as a financial safety net during stressful times at best. Can you imagine having to question whether or not any person you meet is genuine or looking for a hand out. Can you imagine the backlash if you don't want to help someone out financially, even if you can afford to and it is an ""emergency""?"
761,"OP, I want you to think about this for a minute: what would happen if you just.... never talked to him again? Sent a message saying sorry but you don't think you have the same goals and then blocked him from everything? 

You'd probably feel relieved, right? You don't have to deal with this boundaries crossing dude ever again. You are not looking for a relationship, you're not even friends at this point. He's just a guy who you texted a grand total of less than 14 days. 

If you're looking for permission to make that choice, you have mine.  Listen to that feeling in your gut saying there's something off about this whole thing. Don't let your socialization to be nice override your instincts. We have them for a reason. "
762,"It sounds like she's upset he pays more attention and time with you two than her, teaching you to cook etc. Couples need alone time too, do her a favour and allow them some space in the next week i.e don't do things with him alone and keep to your room / go out with friends."

764,"Okay I don't see anyone talking about this--but from your second edit it sounds like he wants to control your sex life because he's possessive of *you*. I don't agree with ""sign it and take his money"" at all. You don't want this creepazoid to have that kind of power over you. Having loans sucks but I'm pretty sure having a nasty perv overlord is worse. Do you have any other relatives you could reach out to?

765,"Amy Poehler has a quote she uses a lot that I've adopted ""good for you, not for me.""

768,"The boss has created a toxic situation, by exploiting the weakness and greed of others.   He's created a boys club and I bet all the men are having a blast.  They probably go out together, strip clubs, golf, bars, and let's not forget the big trip.  The boss is calling the shots, so your poor husband has no choice but to go along otherwise he'll get fired.   It's amazing what people will do for money and power, and I'm referring to your husband.  When your husband gets promoted you won't be able to get away because he won't want to get fired will he?  If friendship with these women is necessary to get promoted it's incredibly naive to think that you can walk away from them after he gets promoted, it will look like you used them.  You're in this for the long haul.  

You need to be very, very, very careful there may be other affairs going on that you aren't aware of, and that others may not be aware of.  I wouldn't tell **any** of these women anything because it could boomerang back to the boss, or could be told to the boss directly via pillow talk.   The women hate their husbands, hate their lives and they might hate you for not getting caught up in the nonsense, but wait that will change.  Once your husband get promoted then you probably won't be allowed to work, because it then looks like he's not getting paid enough and that would be embarrassing for the boss.  The boss is like a chief of police in a small town, he can almost do what he likes because if someone opposes him they'll get ruined.  

You need to have a frank discussion with your husband, the company is providing the house, and the friends, did you see the move The Firm?  They are starting to own your life, all because you husbands wants more money and a title.  It seems like he's valuing his job over the quality of life for him and his family, but he probably doesn't care because he's having a blast with the new job.
 "
769,"This JUST happened. You JUST found out about this two days ago. Of course you're devastated. 

But no one lied or cheated. You feel betrayed, and you have a right to that, of course, but you know you are as much to blame for this situation as your husband. 

Don't make any big decisions right at the moment. I think this is too big of a problem for Reddit to fix. We can't answer a question as personal and life-changing as ""is my marriage over"", because there is no clear villain and we don't actually know you, your husband, or Marla. 

Go to the counseling appointment. Give it a couple months. Give the nightmare time to feel real. Then look at what you want and what you feel and make a decision with a clear head.

And obviously, never had a threesome ever again."
770,He's grieving and unrealistic. Did he expect you to sacrifice your whole future? You mentioned you did all these other things to comfort him so I don't think it's fair for him to treat you like this. Life happens and part of being a good partner is understanding that. I think because he was so traumatized by his dad the death of his grandmother is resurfacing all of those other feelings. It probably feels to him in some round about way that you don't care he was abused. Of course this is totally irrational but I think it means it's over. Dont blame yourself. He has issues and refuses to fix them through therapy.
771,"Good. If some of the replies seem harsh, it's because you are in a very scary situation, and people are worried about you.

This kind of thing can go very, very bad. 

Please be safe. This guy is bad news."
772,"I read this to my boyfriend and both of our reactions were ""I want to yell at this guy"" "
773,"How would he have responded if your family asked about his sperm count during casual conversation? 

These people need boundaries and if he's not setting them he doesn't get to tell you to apologise after you do. 

Good thing you're not getting children any time soon, because he needs to learn how to be a grown-up first."
774,"This is what blows my mind about this. Dave brought a hook-up on a trip of 18 people (presumably 9 long-term couples that all socialize with one another) without any worries that any of the 16 other peple would tell Sarah about it. OP, please take that in: he thinks he can do something horrendously wrong &amp; that the rest of the guys wI'll cover for him &amp; get their girls to keep quiet. I would immediately start to wonder what else has gone down in this group that's just been quietly swept under the rug, since it just seemed implicitly understood that this would be tolerated &amp; never mentioned again."
775,What if there's a fire? 
776,"That you're doing it for socialization does not actually change the fact that you are raising your child completely alone. Your husband contributes literally nothing. 

Here is something my mom told me about why she divorced my dad that stuck with me: ""I actually felt less alone by myself than I did with your dad.""  I'm pretty sure you will feel the same way if you leave your husband. Because all of the pain and resentment you feel for him doing nothing for you? That will all be gone."
777,"Ugh, your poor sister. OP, I don't know the details of your 26-year-old sister's ""couple of bad mistakes"" or how she ""disrespected"" the parents who foisted you guys on her. (This is not a judgment of you. You and your sister were kids–this is a judgment of your parents.)

It seems to me like your sister has been the family scapegoat. Your parents are cruel about your sister, while heaping praise on her husband–one of the more poisonous ways in-laws can torpedo a relationship. Her favored husband sides with you against her, isolating her still further. You talk behind her back to your parents, where they disparage her again. (Something you see as 200% correct, despite the fact that she took you in when she didn't have to and is raising you.) 

OP, if your parents honestly don't think highly of your sister and she were genuinely a bad person, then THEY WERE IRRESPONSIBLE IN GIVING YOU AND YOUR TWIN TO HER TO RAISE. It sounds to me like they've been poisoning you against the sister who they were only to happy to inconvenience when it suited them. You've carried on their contemptuous attitude towards her, undermining her in her own home and in her own marriage. 

I don't blame the two of you, often it takes until adulthood to recognize that you've been raised in a poisonous family system. But I think you need to serious reevaluate whether you think poorly of your sister because she has done OBJECTIVELY BAD THINGS, or whether it has just been normalized in your family to think badly of her. She did not need to offer to keep you, you are not entitled to stay with her, regardless of your parents sending her a check (and then bad-mouthing her behind her back). This suggestion that she did it only to curry favor with your highly critical parents makes me sad, either because it's true and she was that desperate for any form of approval from them, or because it's not true and you act as though it somehow negates the sacrifices she's made for you."
778,"No, I think she sounds unreasonable. Especially about the food thing. That's just a nice, friendly gesture. I've done it for my roommates/friends. As far as your clothes, he's your brother, he's not thinking about you sexually and you should be free to wear what you want in your own home and dry your bra and underpants with the rest of your clothes. "
779,"Yes! Many other commentors also brought this up.  I didn't even think about that because I have never used the site before.  I do know it's used more for ""general ideas"", but I didn't even know about the captions/comments and all that."
780,"It isn't your relationship. You don't need to get involved in that aspect. Just go talk to him with your mom and tell him that your mom broke down and told you and that you don't care at all. Then start talking about your brother. It doesn't have to be this complicated.

This is how you make him trust you in my opinion, come clean just be honest, the longer you put it off, the harder it will be. Just rip the bandaid. The chips will fall where they may you can't control everything. "
781,"Suggest that you could take this job if you free up a lot of time by not doing any cooking or cleaning, and he picks up all the slack on that. He should take on all the housecleaning and cooking, and make sure you have a hot meal every time you get home from your exhausting job. After all, he's let you do all that work while you were working full-time, so he clearly believes it's possible. See what his response is.

I don't suggest you follow through on taking the job, but the response he gives to this suggestion may illuminate some things for you."
782,"Even though I'm not OP, I just want to thank you for sitting down and taking the time to write out such a detailed, concise and genuine response to a complete strangers problem. 

It's people like you that are more often than not the difference between someone ending their lives and someone pulling themselves together. Sometimes realising that there are people like them out there that have gone through these issues and who can help, can be all they need. 

You rock =) "
783,"It's not weird, it's pretty obvious what is going on.

You have spent 10 years of your life as the ""other woman"".  Accept it, dump him, and try to move on.  My guess is that you can find someone who treats you nicely and doesn't have a list of rules for you to follow like a maid."
784,I really don't think this was some sort of exhibitionist action. Nudity is  not inherently sexual. 
785,"Nice update.

I see you often prefer to take the high road, but sometimes you seem a bit dense about telling people what happened and what's happening. 

There's nothing wrong to explain people why you want to stay away from bully Ashley, especially since she likes to draw you as the bad guy."
786,"I'm the same as /u/pbmonster in that I will normally say ""girl"". I wouldn't say the phrase ""38 year old girl"" though, in that context I'd say ""38 year old woman"" since the sentence itself is quite formal. However I would say ""in a relationship with a girl"" in reference to a 38 year old without giving it a second thought.

Different people speak in different ways. Just because *you* exclusively use ""girl"" to refer to children that doesn't mean that everybody else does. To try to paint OP as some sort of sick paedophile who views this girl as a child is just messed up."
787,If you sent them to her she's in just as much trouble as you are since she didn't report you immediately. If she turns you in now they're going to assume she used them. 
788,"The fact he wanted the son gone but the daughter could stay is a bit suspect. Regardless, if you do talk to your mom I'd suggest just getting answers as to why you had to be sent away. If you don't need closure, then don't bother. Your mom gave up her chance to be in your life, you don't have to give her another chance if you don't want to."

790,"Record them. Then the next time they start play the recording super loud. If they ignore it continue and slowly increase the volume. It will be weird and they will stop.  You don't stop, though. Play the recording for another 5min. Make them feel just as awkward as it makes you feel. Laugh and bang on the walls at random moments.

793,"Would you bloody STOP, right now and forever, with that disgusting depersonalizing ""hur hur your husband will love it"" creepy weirdo CRAP?

Her body exists for HER. Only her. Only ever her. This is so creepy it pegs the meter. STOP IT."
794,"Sounds to me like she uses you only when it's convenient for her. The good news is that it sounds as though you've improved yourself throughout the relationship. If any of your friends have told you that you could do better, they're probably right. "
795,"""either you talk to a therapist about your fucking bullshit way that you are treating our son or I will have serious misgivings about our relationship. Stop being a coward."""
796,"That's why she said what she said.  It was calculated to hurt you as much as she could.

I know it sucks right now, and will for a long time, but eventually you will be thankful you are no longer with someone who would take so much pleasure in hurting you."
797,Thanks. I think I will still apologize because what I said was totally heinous. Luckily I am a stay at home mom for now but I will be sure to be more diligent about keeping doers and windows locked. Do I need to have proof she said those things to go to the police? Will they contact her? I'd rather they didn't. 
798,"I am hoping for all the positive things for you, your husband, and your pregnancy. 

Surround yourself with those positive people, your *chosen* family, and let those connections to the people that are related to you fade out. A lot of people don't realize, but we can choose our family. Just because we are related to someone doesn't make them family. "
799,"Ehh, shit happens. At least you didn't meet the guy. This wasn't a part of your life in any way just two weeks ago, no need to get too worked up about it imo."
800,"Your mother is really out of step here, OP.  Your siblings are bound to be hurt when they find out that they are not invited.

I'm not sure about this year, but perhaps next year you and all of the siblings could plan a camping trip together, with or without your mother.

Don't let her be the gate keeper on the relationships with your siblings, because she is not cooperating.  You and the sibs need to organize and make the plans now."
801,"*blinks*

Why are you still with this asshole? You convinced me about 1/3 of the way in and it just got worse and worse and worse. He literally treats you like garbage, and is emotional abusing you. He has anger issues and who knows what else. The part where he makes you drive 2/10ths of a mile to/from his work had me laughing out loud. What an entitled toad.

I would take him to work tomorrow, get some friends to help move your stuff out, and block his number and let him wait on for you after work, never to hear from you ever again. The only things to worry about are the lease/utilities, but it would totally be worth taking some loss there just so you can be away from him."
802,"Oof...methinks there are some toxic family dynamics coming to the surface here. I suspect they're in the habit of disguising emotional abuse as ""honesty."""
803,"As someone planning a wedding, seriously, if a $150 ring is a stressful thing to him you're setting yourself up for a tough road. Not that the money is that important but his ability to comprehend costs and budget is concerning.  He doesn't sound like an adult with a reasonable understanding of expenses at all. $150 is an anniversary dinner not the cost of a ring that symbolizes you want to spend forever with someone. There's nothing wrong with simple and not over the top rings or weddings etc but his shocked reaction leads me to believe you all haven't lived in the real world yet. "
804,"&gt; What does she mean by ""more established as a couple""? 1.5 years? 3 years? At your wedding? At the birth of your first grandkid?

She meant perhaps when we're engaged or something or at least are more independent. We've both just turned 20 this year and this is the longest relationship I've been in so she wants to tell them when it wouldn't be as easy for her parents to dismiss me as just some random kid their daughter is dating. Either way I'm not really sure I can do this since it would mean having to lie about my moms for an extended period of time. 

Telling them before the BBQ is a good suggestion, thanks."
805,"And every time it's brought up, he'll likely feel embarrassed because he grew up and knew it wasn't appropriate. Unlike OP's BIL."
806,If there's anything I've learned from this subreddit it's that they were probably smoking weed lol. 
807,"I agree. I dated a guy who would act like a complete drunken dumbass, and I wanted to be the ""cool, chill girlfriend"" and didn't hold him accountable for it...trust me, your future will thank you if you either confront him or end it. It's not worth it to avoid the fight now, because I guarantee something like this will happen again and he will not take any responsibility. "
808,"It doesn't matter, he is abusive and wishes to cut you off from people who support you."
809,"Also, don't go to the wedding. Too many people in this world get away with terrible behavior because everyone will sweep everything under the rug to ""keep up appearances"". "
810,"well, if they are deaf to you, you can be deaf to them. Just ignore them and do what makes you happy.

IMO call or text Max **ASAP** to let him know people might make up some stories about you, they might spin some mean plot that you are totally mean or hateful (when you're really trying to teach the twins an honest lesson, really). **Let Max know now they are trying to damage this trip**"
811,"It's really interesting how people seem to think that OP was raised by narcissists based on her perception of a situation in which she was obviously insecure. 

So Alex is naturally charismatic and smart? Ok, what is he supposed to do about that? Not be? I don't know.

Alex left home because his parents were pressuring him. Two things on that. No parent wants their child drifting around aimlessly after college and they probably didn't want their son back in their house after college because he didn't have a plan. Alex didn't want to deal with what he saw as parental pressure and left. How was he wrong, OP? You could have done the same thing, instead you stayed and followed your parents' plan. How was that his fault? You could have left too. You could have put your foot down. You could have fucked off to Europe to find yourself too. But you didn't, and now you blame him for that?

I'm not even touching the girlfriend stuff, because you know she has nothing to do with this OP. That's all you."
812,"There's nothing wrong with having mainstream hobbies. In fact, consider it a bonus: you don't attract jerks who have superiority complexes over subjective preferences.

Also, $5 says that he liked to play video games or was into technology, which are somehow more legitimate hobbies than art, design, language and fashion."
813,"I am seriously regretting hurting my brother, and I never would have done this if I had realized how deeply this would have effected him. But I feel like his reaction has been completely fucking insane and I don't understand why no one else in my family can see that. Nate's fiance sent me an email and I'm debating what I should say."
814,"Brah if you don't want the surgery don't get the surgery. Your body, your choice. Use condoms instead. BUT also don't claim to have empathy for what she did with her body because clearly you have a peepee rather than a hoohaa and have not experienced childbirth. 

It's normal to be scared of pain, just stop faffing about and say it loud and clear: you don't want the surgery.

Of course she'll be upset, if she's VERY upset then suggest marital counselling. But I'm not going to tell anyone to get surgery on their junk if they're not 100% willing."
815,Not to mention those two demands are utterly bizarre and contradictory.
816,"So you make the whole weekend about him instead. Whenever you hand in this report, from that moment it's go time on spoiling him.

Tell your parents and get them to forward you some money - put your would-be gift money to that and go for something big and bold and don't shy away from apologising out loud. Tell him you'll make an effort to be better than this in the future, and that you'll speak to the rest of the family - don't leave it up to the kid to do that extremely difficult thing on his own."
817,"I think it's more along the lines of the fact that the sister said he was getting kicked out no matter what, so OP is picking him up to make sure that, no matter what, he's in a safe place.  It's probably more 'make sure nephew is safe first, deal with wtf is going on with my sister later' than just shrugging it off."
818,"I review resumes and have done hiring. Depending on the job and other qualifications- I would adore seeing GARLIC BREAD, lol as that's hilarious and original. Based on your age, and career position- this can majorly work to your advantage as people will remember you! I would not re email everyone, but instead just wait for people to reach out to you. Play this off as intentional and you'll see that originality is often rewarded. It's truly nothing to get so upset over at this stage in your job search. Good luck !!!"
819,"Don't uninvite the children. Leave it up to Christina whether or not they can go. She can be the one to tell them why, because ultimately she's the parent and it is her decision. "
820,"It is well within your boyfriend's rights to feel that you should shoulder costs that you incur. However, you are currently living outside your means, and his philosophy works both ways.

Downsize your living arrangements to save costs, as that seems to be the sticking point. While personal responsibility is a necessity in adulthood, there is a point where it can go too far. If I were in his position, you're damn right I'd be bailing my girl out. After five years? I'd do whatever I needed to help her get her head above water, and I'd hope she'd be willing to do the same if the situation were reversed."
821,"&gt;No, I actually went looking for what to do I case of an infection

You take fucking antibiotics and move on with your life. 

&gt;and came across many people talking about PVPS. Started googling it and it became clear the % of risk of that happening is In the double digits

The plural of anecdote is not data. 

&gt;Not a lot of official studies outside of post op surveys, a few urologists on youtube and reading about peoples experiences.

So you're making a mountain out of a molehill. This is up there with the antivax movement in terms of scientific viability. Speaking as someone who had a 1 in a million, near fatal illness stemming from an incredibly common medical procedure that left me permanently disabled: you're being a fucking baby. Your wife has taken far greater risk delivering three children than you will with your 30 minute procedure. Get over yourself. 

Edit: fun thing about Youtube, they don't check people's credentials. If a urologist were sitting on damning data about vasectomies, they would be publishing that shit in the New England Journal of medicine. They would not be reading testimonials on a Youtube channel. That's how you lose all professional credibility.

822,"Get the cat chipped and registered to you.

A few days before she is due to move, move the cat to boarding kennels so it is out of the way. Your excuse is ""so it doesnt get hurt/stressed/accidentally released during the move""

This is your cat, and you have a strong argument for its welfare. Keep repeating those two points."

826,"'Furiously Angry' is not the right response to this email if you've been exclusive for over a year. Your boyfriend isn't being realistic or mature if he finds a thoughtful, well-written letter asking for clarity and commitment a problem. Honestly, I could understand confusion and apprehension but there's nothing in here that should spark anger. If nothing else, ending with 'can we talk about it' is pretty reasonable. 

I think this is a case where you're 'throwing your pearls before swine'. If he's not mature enough to respond to this letter properly, you're wasting your time. You want a grown-up who can consider the needs of the other person. It's clear that your needs aren't being met, and his response to your request makes it clear that he's not able to change that. Time to cut your losses and move on.

When you do, he may try to 'say anything' to keep you around. What he has to do is convince you that he cares about *you*, and not simply *the way you make him feel*. At the moment, I'd wager that it's the latter."
827,"This is way above Reddit's paygrade, tbh. Therapy, first of all... Regardless of what you decide to do. It might also be helpful to go with your wife in the meantime so that the two of you can work through your grief and how you want to go forward. So therapy for you individually so you can work through your grief and your feelings about everything, and also together if you decide to try and save the relationship. 

It sounds like it's possible that the two of them realized what was happening and took steps to try and make sure it didn't go further, but your wife should have talked to you. "
828,"You can't say you trust someone and then track them 24/7. You just can't, it's an oxymoron. His explanations are nonsense. "
829,"She feels how she feels.  We here on the internet can speculate about causes (perhaps she really resents having your sister and nephew living with you more than she has let on, perhaps there's something else going on; there's no way for us to know).

There are people who in general have no particular like for children, and only ever really form a bond with their own.

You can't *make* your wife feel something she does not, and until you understand the reasons for why she treats your nephew the way she does, anything you try will be superficial at best.

Have you had a conversation with your wife about it?  The only reasonable path forward here is to gather more information so that you truly understand what is going on, before you try to change anything."
830,Your partner is a repeat offender and an all around shitty person. Why are you still with this person? 
831,Right?  What a concept. 
832,"Dude.

He HIT your PREGNANT sister.  TWICE.  Does that seem physically or emotionally healthy to you?  Your sister is being abused, and the cycle of abuse followed by apologies is going to continue so long as the people around her (your scummy parents) pretend this is normal behavior and don't support her choice to proceed with a divorce.  

Don't get me wrong, this situation is not your fault.  Your parents shouldn't be enabling your brother-in-law's abuse, and ultimately your sister is the only one with the agency to leave this toxic situation.  But PLEASE talk to your sister, tell her you're concerned that she's experiencing domestic violence and abuse, and do your best to support her if she does want to leave her husband.  It's often tough for individuals experiencing abuse to realize that the situation is not normal and that their lives will be better without the toxic partner.  She's going to need all the support she can get if she ever does leave her husband, so try to provide that even if your other family members are willfully blind to what's going on in her marriage."
833,What? Pay the father to watch his own child? You have a Masters and you don't know the answer to this? Take a stab at it.
834,"""Help with the Anthony thing"" by fixing his shitty behavior. Better you help him with it now than later, because nobody in the real world is going to put up with his attitude. He's the minor, and he's the one you're responsible for training/correcting. And he's going to get his ass handed to him or worse.

""Sweetness and light"" ha. No. Nobody is that, and definitely not when pushed to their last damn nerve. Stop equivocating and trying to split the blame here. "
835,Thank you for this 
836,No 'maybe' about it. OP needs to call CPS *yesterday*.

We are training and not fighting so it sounds like there may be a culture issue at that gym. I have been doing it a long time and have no issues sparing with new people. I help them to learn and have never had anyone complain. I go light with newer people and just work at a pace they are comfortable with and everyone always has a good time. 

Honestly I don't know you but this comes across as a gym with a bad culture, a humble brag, or that you are a bad training partner. "
839,"The Recovery programs tend to cover the fact that forgiveness/reconciliation is a thing that you offer, not demand, so the guilt-trippy letter implies that he's not as far along in his recovery as he thinks he is.

"
841,Sounds like they are setting you up for a drug bust
842,"Doing this once and apologizing is ignorant. Being called out several times by multiple people and still doing it is just douchey. I doubt a long sit-down is going to accomplish anything, and if his comments are actively making your struggle with body image more difficult, I frankly don't think it's worth it. 
"
843,"That seems exactly right, and to his credit. If he had been flirtatious with you or other students, if he had accepted invitations to go out, or socialize with students, there may have been some students who could have tried to misinterpret his actions, or tried to cozy up to him to get better grades. If he's attractive I'm sure he knows it, and I'm sure that there have been people who promised to ""do just anything"" for a better grade, or people who would have invited him out to social events, just for the chance to kiss up.  
 
So the fact that he was 100% professional (maybe even annoyingly so) seems to indicate that he is good at setting those kind of boundaries which is important in an academic setting. "
844,"thats obviously not the case. Its obviously something serious, and he obviously cant trust OP even if he IS innocently protecting some girl from an unwanted pregnancy or an abusive family situation because she went STRAIGHT to OPs MOM. She is, objectively untrustable. Not saying thats healthy. Not saying he didnt do anything wrong. He may have. But if he is being noble, this would look exactly the same. "

846,"Yeah David has always been a bit of an ass which is why we were only friends in high school and college and not best friends.

He always seemed to be a little too much about himself.

I do have a friend that I'm close to within our little circle of friends and I think maybe it is a good idea to send them this link and see how it goes.

I really want to be in Sarah's life so hopefully that does happen but unless she approaches me I don't think I have the right to talk to her. 

I never in a million years would have thought that my letter would even get David a date or two. I thought it would be seen as a nice gesture and then maybe she would feel better.

848,"&gt; Seeing their naked bodies in our wedding photos was shocking albeit thrilling.

Yeah, this part threw me way off when reading. Get rid of those and don't be a creeper about it."
849,"I think this probably falls under the ""good intention, but not so great execution"" category. 

First off, when you say critique, what exactly do you mean? This is really broad and could vastly change the needed advice for the situation (for example, if you're critiquing in the moment, it can feel more like an exam he's being graded upon.) 

As a general rule, going into sex with the sole goal of ""get person x to finish"" when they have had trouble in the past is going to feel more like drudgery work than fun, sexy times like we think it will be heading into it. 

Now is the lack of climaxing maybe because he's just not hitting the right spots in the right ways? Possibly, but I have found that a lot of the time when I haven't finished with a partner (especially after that long of being together) the issue more comes from myself.

Not to be too TMI, but for me I have to be in a certain place and mindset to have that earth shattering OMG orgasm. If I'm stressed from work, or it's super late at night, or hungry...lol forget it he could do all the right things for 10 hours straight and it STILL wouldn't happen. Think about when you have your ""private time"" (if you do) and what is mentally going on for you. Personally, the better and more organic the build up to sex (sex comes out of nowhere, like we were cooking or doing some other activity) the better my body responds. I also like a slow burn instead of hot and heavy right away for my own self.

Now I did notice say you haven't had an orgasm...do you mean just with him or in general? If it is more of the latter, thing is if you don't get off with yourself (you don't masturbate) then you may want to start experimenting to see what you like and what you don't. It's almost a blind leading the blind in that situation if you catch my drift.

I would recommend for the critiquing part to keep it more positive: ""ooh I really like that!"" Or just be more vocal and responsive to the things you do like vs using negative language towards the things you don't ""it doesn't feel as good..."". Now by all means please please please speak up if something hurts or crosses boundaries by any means, but the more negative connotations you use in regards to his attempts to get you off are going to start coloring his perspective negative as well. 

I know this was a lot of word vomit but I hope it helps a little! 

"
850,"I mean, your FSIL sounds awful, but I do think you should maybe have less conversations about your sisters' breasts and in general get a little less involved in all this drama. You talk about your sister's figure a lot. It's a little weird to read, and more importantly, it seems to make your sister pretty uncomfortable."
851,What a horrendous idea.
852,"&gt;BFs ex apparently had also called R around 6 months after myself and BF had gotten together and asked him to help me if anything happened.

She's good people. And clearly your ex was abusive enough that she was very legitimately concerned about what he could do in future to someone else. It might be cathartic to discuss things with someone else who has experienced ex's behaviour, but you might also want to move on and forget about it, or she might, as she contacted R quite some time ago? Maybe wait for things to settle a bit more and you can think over whether you want to do that.

Your ex's family sound like lovely people, and hopefully the fact that your ex's own family is testifying that he got violent trying to get to you and threatening to hurt himself if you didn't do what he wanted will negate any lies he manages to spin for the police about none of this being his fault. Definitely sort out a restraining order ASAP! This is exactly the sort of situation they're for.

Also I know you're a bit overwhelmed by everything that's happened right now, but it might be a nice idea to think of ways you could thank R for stepping in and giving you a place to stay. Maybe helping to sort out the damage caused by your ex's tantrum or taking over some household duties? 

I'm glad you got out of there, OP :)"
853,"&gt;And this :
&gt;I haven't talked to her in a few days
Is an over reaction. Especially if you're having a baby, especially in the days following that announcement.

THANK YOU for pointing that out. I was wondering why nobody is mentioning how IMMATURE it is for two grown ass adults who are having a child to ignore each other for a few DAYS. "
854,"&gt;The worst thing is, I don't even think he's threatened by me at all.

&gt;At one point I was a bit of a douche and made some comment about my ex being the breadwinner and he just praised her and said, ""it's 2016"" and how he hoped their daughter was as kickass as their mother which got him a lot of praise from the group we were in and made me look like some sexist douchebag.

&gt;I don't know if the ""old white boys"" was a dig at me since I'm white and I also didn't really know how to contribute because to be honest, I didn't really look at what the networking event was for. I thought it would be more of a networking thing than a charity thing, but it was really more of a charity thing.

&gt;Also, it out he's one of those ""cool"" schoolteachers who get involved with the community and stuff which was what inspired this charity/networking event where even the organizer gave him personal thanks for his involvement and inspiring this etc. and how teachers were so undervalued in their role in ""shaping the future"".

This might come off as a bit harsh, but based on what you wrote, it seems like things such as trust in a relationship, gender-equality, and charity are somewhat foreign to you.  It's understandable if your jealous of him, but instead of just channeling that into resentment, why don't you use these examples to become a better person yourself?

I hope you find someone who's a good match for you in the future.  And, for the record, I don't think pre-nups are always a bad idea.  Sometimes they really are for the best."
855,I bet this is exactly the kind of child he was.
856,"&gt; Is make-up before the gym even a good idea?

Good lord, no.  The only type of person who would wear makeup to the gym would be...well, someone who thinks the gym is basically a meat market, and not someplace people actually go to work out.

Please stop feeling guilty.  You can't reason with someone who's building their argument around made-up logic.  The only thing speaking up sooner might have done would be to expose these issues so you could have gotten yourself out of this situation sooner.  I'm sure you'll be able to find someone who can be a workout partner, or at least supportive of your efforts to take care of yourself rather than worrying about what it means for them."
857,"Christ, if I was the sister I'd feel pretty violated that you had naked photos.  You need to find out whether they knew the photos were being taken and that you have copies."
858,"But he's removing her from making a decision. ""You can wait on your schooling"" but she doesn't want to. 

She's not saying she never wants kids, she's saying she wants to stick to the plan they'd originally worked out, *together*. He is the one changing things up and getting mad about her not bending to his whim. "
859,"She's 19 14 months after the harassment stopped which went on for 10 months, so she was 17 or younger when it started."
860,"You're not in the wrong, you didn't cheat, and you don't sound like an asshole. 

I wouldn't get back together with her, and not just because of this.  She wants marriage and possibly children, and she doesn't have an endless window of time for the latter. It sounds like she'd be better off moving on and finding someone more compatible with her life goals."
861,"I'm so, so proud of you, you acted really bravely. Stay strong!"
862,I think the bigger issue is that you're considering going out with someone that accosted you.  Have some standards.  There's plenty of guys out there that will be interested in what you're looking for.  Just download tinder and put it on your profile.

865,"As an addition to the last point I would start looking at homes for your father now and find a nice one. One bad slip could land you father in the hospital and then in the first available spot in a home rather than a nice home. You do not need to move your father in right away but getting him on the waiting list (and staying on it if the space becomes available and he's not ready to move) is a very good thing to plan ahead of time, rather than in a moment of stress and necessity."
866,"To add to this, I think it would also be irresponsible to bring children you know nothing about. That you have no idea how they would interact with your children or how they would respond to you being in charge. I'm not alluding to them being bad kids, just that it seems dangerous to take them to a foreign country when you know literally noting about them.

I can see how it would come across as excluding them, but even if you knew them well it seems like far too many children to safely keep an eye on. You could suggest having your sister and her husband come along and it can be just this massive family vacation. I would hope though, that they would assume financial responsibility for themselves and the remaining children. 

If the new husband expected you to pay for the other 4 kids or even themselves, I'd be looking at him in a very different light. "
867,"I don't understand why he KEPT the letters in the first place. I can understand writing down frustrations, maybe even hateful things if I was annoyed and frustrated, but I wouldn't keep it for 5 years. I'd destroy it right away. And some of those things he wrote are just downright mean. If I were OP I would be crying in the box I found them in until he got home and wondered what was up. There's absolutely no way OP can ignore this. I might be a blessing that she found them. There's more to those letter than we know. "
868,"OP, even my ex - who had a lot of trouble expressing his feelings and being vulnerable - would be the sweetest whenever I cried. He would put aside whatever beliefs he had about people crying to comfort me, because he valued my feelings. That's how partners should behave.

Partners should NOT be kicking their emotionally vulnerable girlfriend out the door. Like....even FRIENDS shouldn't be doing that to each other, and definitely NOT your significant other. "
869,He wants all the authority with none of the responsibility. Don't we all.
870,"As a bride-to-be, you don't really get to dictate if you get a plus one if you are single. If people were in a relationship when my invitations went out, that was a long-term one, they got a plus one. But my single friends did not; there will be people at the wedding that they know and can socialize with. Some people don't realize how much weddings can cost, especially as you are generally talking about $100/plate. My best friend is not getting a plus one, as she only started dating her guy 2 months ago (and I'm not having a virtual stranger at my wedding).

Just keep in mind, it's just one day. I'm far from bridezilla, and am letting things roll off my back that I'm sure most brides wouldn't, but I would hate for someone to dictate who I have to invite to my own wedding. I want to be surrounded by people that care about me and want to share this joyful moment with me. "
871,"Thiiiiis. I feel so much for your poor sister, I have gone through the body shaming and self-hate that she has. Don't go to the Damn wedding, and stop making comments about your sister's body, even if they're positive. That isn't going to make her feel better. Just be there for her. Don't go to the wedding, don't let your parents force that on her."
872,"I think being nude around someone else's kid is kind of like spanking someone else's kid. It might be ok, it might not. You should probably check first.

Leave her the fuck alone and take a long hard look in the mirror. Try and be a better person."
875,"Also you have to question WHY she wants to get back with you. Is it for you, or because she thought you, unlike most other guys, would support her and her baby even though it wasnt his?  I mean, where is the baby's daddy?"
876,"I don't know whether to stare in sympathetic shock or laugh my ass off. Maybe both. This is so bizarre and unfortunate it's hilarious. 

The truth is, as long as you and your boyfriend are saying it's not rape, he can't be charged.  And as long as your brother lives he will never get that image out of his head, even if it was consensual.  It will take a long time before they subconsciously get past this. The best you can do is stay firm and for the LOVE OF GOD DONT EVER HAVE SEX AT YOUR PARENTS PLACE AGAIN"
877,"I think you're a lot more likely to kick yourself for letting your parents bribe you into a breakup because they didn't approve of your life choices.

883,"Interviewers often base their questions on aspects of your resume that catch their eye. There's probably a high chance they'll ask you about the garlic bread situation. At that point you should take the opportunity to show some personality and tell them how it was a prank from your sister, and generally make light of the situation. 

Turn it into a positive by making it a humorous situation for you and the interviewers, then offer to tell them about your *real* hobbies. I think this could make the best out of the situation or even potentially make the interview more fun than it would have been before!"

885,"Not to mention OP's girlfriend isn't interested in having sex with him, but she is interested in having sex with another woman? That suggests to me that she might be a lesbian who's slowly coming to terms with her sexuality. The cheating is a big deal, and in this case, the gender of the cheating partner, combined with OP's sex life with his gf, suggests that the gf might not even be into OP sexually. "

891,"You definitely need to call it ""touching me"" and ""touching my body"", which is what the problem is, *not* ""tickling"". 

The main point is you don't want him touching you at all. I mean, if he was stroking the back of your leg you wouldn't like that either. He uses ""tickling"" to rationalise what he's doing. Don't just say ""stop"" - define the behaviour. It's unwanted touching.

Tickling is a sexual fetish for some people so apart from the obvious bullying and harassment this is quite likely sexual harassment."
892,"I dated a guy that would call himself a freak when I'd try to talk to him about me not wanting to continue engaging in his fetishes. 

In my opinion, it wasn't a response of embarrassment as much as manipulation. He wanted me to feel bad for not wanting to keep doing things his way, and to apologize to him for voicing my preferences. Be gentle with his feelings, of course, but don't back down and retreat just because he gets mopey."
893,"Plus, the last time he was presented with one of her Pinterest boards, all the captions were her own.

There's nothing wrong with having a plan for her future if things don't work out with you. You need to chill."
904,"&gt;she wants to tell them when it wouldn't be as easy for her parents to dismiss me as just some random kid their daughter is dating

You've already reached this point. Her parents know you well enough to want to meet your parents. If you keep up *Gaby's* lie, her parents will eventually find out and you won't be the guy with two moms, you'll be the guy who lied to them. Telling them before the BBQ is definitely the best idea if you plan on staying with Gaby. Gaby needs to be apologetic about *her* lie and you need to be straightforward. ""My dad and my mom divorced x years ago and aren't on the best terms right now, but thankfully my mom married her long-term partner last year. Her name is (insert name)."" This is all they need to know. Telling them is not about confronting their views about homosexuality. It's about introducing your family. 

My dad/step-mom are extremely conservative Christians who think homosexuality is a sin. They voted against gay marriage; they are not ashamed to discuss their beliefs. But when my brother introduced his gay best friend to them, they took it in stride. As certain as I am that they prayed for his friend's immortal soul later, they kept their mouths shut at the time because 1) it was rude, and 2) they weren't stupid enough to think they could change his mind. Maybe Gaby's parents will do the same?

Let's assume they don't freak out about your moms when you explain beforehand. Take note of their attitude and Gaby's and *tell your moms* about it. They deserve to know what they what they may be walking into. 

EDIT: How many people are going to this BBQ? Who else is invited? Is it soon? I hate to say it, but Gaby's parents may be more willing to accept your moms if they don't have to do it in front of their friends who presumably have similar views. And if they have more time to process the news. Maybe suggest something with just of the six of you? Leave them options, just make sure they all include not disrespecting your moms. "

Those things would be enough to make me wonder if he actually likes me or if he just tolerates me most of the time. If for YEARS I hadn't the faintest clue he thought these things, it means he's good at hiding it.. so what else is he really feeling that I don't know?

Not to mention if this is a venting exercise like people are saying, these things actually upset him enough for him to go write it down to cope with it instead of just letting the feeling and thought pass.

&gt; Its not like he's some stranger, he's my nephew, my flesh and blood, that makes him her nephew, her family.

Right, and then his cousin, and the cousin's aunt, and the aunt's brother-in-law, and - where does it stop? Everyone is everyone's family at some point. There is something in between strangers and flesh and blood, she's not treating him like a stranger if she treats him differently to her own flesh and blood. Your flesh and blood is not her flesh and blood, apart from your own son. It doesn't matter that your son and nephew look alike, that doesn't make your nephew your wife's son! Please bear in mind when you compare the actions of your wife and sister that your son is your sister's blood nephew and your nephew is not your wife's blood nephew - he is *your* blood nephew, obviously, but *you are not your wife*!

A lot of people would not even have their sister-in-law living with them, and then on top of that you're giving money to her too - I don't see anything wrong with what you're doing but most spouses would not have let you gone this far. Your wife has! She's been very generous to your sister and nephew, absolutely taken them into her family, she has literally taken them into her house! And now you're saying apart from this, that when she's affectionate with your nephew she's *not affectionate enough* - it's not fair at all. I think you also think women should love all children as their own children and that's not fair either. A woman not loving a child (especially a child she's not even actually related to by blood) like her own child is not some kind of coldness, I really don't think you'd expect that from a man. Your nephew has a mother if he needs mothering! Your wife is his aunt by marriage and it sounds like a normal relationship, not worrying or strange in the slightest."
945,"It's good your SIL is finally realizing she shouldn't put up with the verbal abuse your brother hurled at her for years, but she needs to realize a clean break is the healthy, adult thing to do not cheat behind his back.

And totally independent of the cheating, your brother needs to majorly work on himself and his abusive tendencies."
946,"Text from locked post:

&gt;I met my boyfriend in our masters program. We became friends over this past year, and started dating and becoming serious shortly before I left the state for a summer internship.


&gt; He gifted me a book to read, saying it was one he liked. It's ""A Spell for Chameleon"" by Piers Anthony, a fantasy novel written several decades ago. I knew nothing about it prior, and began laughing at it two pages in because of how ridiculous the writing was, especially about women.


&gt; We skyped after I got through the first chapter, and I tried respectfully explaining my doubts about the book. He made a deal with me: Knowing I'm a big Harry Potter fan, he promised to give the HP series a chance, starting with Philosopher's Stone, if I gave his book a chance and kept reading. This rocked my world, and I had a sudden burst of motivation.


&gt; I'm on chapter three, and I cannot stand this book. It is one of the most sexist and misogynistic texts I have ever had to read, and it honestly makes me feel like crap. Not to mention it's just poorly written all around - painfully spoon-feeding obvious symbolism, and excessively throwing in fantasy creatures/concepts that do nothing for the plot. The protagonist is a complete dillhole that I could not care less about, and as a reader, I don't want to follow him or anything in the fantasy world of Xanth.


&gt; But of course, flat out telling my boyfriend those thoughts about a book he enjoys would be hurtful, and he has every right to have different preferences. I am shocked that he would recommend such a book to me though. He is a respectful and educated man, treating me very well and identifying as a proud feminist. This recommendation was out of left field! Does he not remember how hurtful the author's writing on women is? Did he read it at a young age, and has since grown?


&gt; I can't expect him to hold his end of the bargain and read Harry Potter, which is fine, especially if it means not having to put myself through Piers Anthony's excuse for writing ever again. I like my boyfriend a lot. How do I respectfully tell him WHY I cannot invest in this book anymore? It's important to me that he realizes the negative messages being suggested, but I want to do this without insulting his taste or making him feel at fault.


&gt; tl;dr: Boyfriend gave me a book to read, and I accepted. I think it's sexist and poorly written. How do I tell him that I cannot keep reading? Should I explain my concerns? "
947,'and that's how I became a professional gimp'
948,"&gt; some sort of judge

You don't even remotely listen or take interest not only in your kids activities but your husband's volunteerism.   My god... I've never seen anyone so apparently selfish...Your husband should divorce you. You're a complete cancer to those that you supposed to love the most with this ""all about me"" bullshit attitude. "
949,"&gt; wants us to ""continue to date"" but ""not exclusively"".

So he wants to make you some side piece.

Cut your losses."
950,"My heart is hurting for all my large-boobed sisters right now. There is just no winning the boob wars. 

I'd skip it too. That, or go scorched earth and show up in a plunging neckline and push-up bra. But I'm a bit of an asshole like that."
951,"Yes he's addicted.  
I'm a hardcore gamer (30+ hours a week) and he's got a strong reek of the behavioural addiction symptoms (games, like gambling etc is a behaviour addiction, not a physical one).  
You need to do a few things.    
  
Firstly, You need to properly sit him down and talk to him properly about this.   
You've said this in your OP:   
*'I've told him his usage bothers me and that there are appropriate times to play, but it seems to go in and out.""*  
But this, this is not direct, strong and clear enough. It's time to address to the fallout it's having on your relationship, how it's making you really feel and what the consequences of his actions are.   
  
Secondly, I've given others on here advice on how to reduce the amount of time he spends gaming with both of you coming up with a kind of ""Online/Offline"" day/times system, you can read about that stuff [Here](https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lpxwh/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_24m_of_four_years_has/) and [Here](https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gdk66/me_24_f_with_my_bf_31_m_of_15_years_i_feel_like_i/). I'd only be repeating a lot of what I've said already in those threads.  
    
Finally you can give him an ultimatum ""Me or the Machine"".  
If you want more advice, feel free to PM me.  
"
952,"A few questions. Does he know how pintrest works? If he saw a ton of pins he might have thought that you spent hours upon hours planning for this dream wedding. Does he know when you made the board? Making the point that it was made only after the engagement was put on the table may make him think differently. 

But honestly there is something else going on here. This reaction was way over the top. You should seriously give marriage a second thought here. "
953,Because it's really really gross?
954,"I think that's actually a good idea. In my last thread, many people told me to just deny everything but it seems I didn't really do anything illegal and I think she actually deserves to have this brought to the attention of her professor. "
955,"Mostly people don't understand that professions they don't understand constitute _work_, and they don't value what they don't pay for. To them, because they don't understand it, they think a graphic designer is just someone who can work Photoshop, a photographer is someone who owns a camera, and a wedding planner is a not really a job because it's just a bunch of stuff.

This is why I recommend never doing professional services for free as a favor to friends or family. Do another favor. I'm sure it can work sometimes, but the risk to the relationship is high."
956,"This is really *really* important. Whatever OP decides to do it is crucial he doesn't tell her that it is about her body. 

OP deserves to have somebody he is attracted to and she deserves to be with somebody who is attracted to her. "
957,"I work in this field, so let me give you a better background.  It sounds like the place is really good.  However, they have a state license and have to ensure proper care of all of the residents as legally required.  Your dad by being burnt that bad is endangering their license.  Also their livelihood as who wants to send a parent to a place where someone gets 2nd degree burns?

Your mom has to suck it up and deal with the fact that her husband is so mentally unsound that he literally won't come in out of the sun.  He NEEDS this level of care.  What I would recommend for her is to have a talk with the facility about positive conditioning.  Offer him a reason to come in that respects his choices but gets him in.  Is it bingo time?  Time for a manicure?  How about his favorite show?  Could the care givers call your mom and then go tell your dad that he has a call inside?

Otherwise...either he leaves or he will just lose his right to outside time.  Facilities do NOT play when it comes to licenses."
958,"Your husband's perception is that he needs you to socially network on his behalf. That isn't uncommon, depending on the industry (speaking here as a spouse of someone that worked 20 years in advertising).

Make it clear to your husband that he will not benefit from this friendship. Be very blunt about it; they start drinking at noon, make terrible comments about everyone, bash their husbands as a game, and mock you openly for not being exactly like them. There is no way to curry their favor. If you turned around tomorrow and started crushing Chardonnay at 11:59am and talking shit about everyone around you, quit your job, and ignored your kids all day *they'd gouge you for that, too.* You can't win. There is no friendship to be had.

Besides, don't their kids act out from being parented by toxic people? They will soon. I suggest getting your kids signed up for swim lessons and cut your visits down to once a week. Then, start cancelling all together. Your husband isn't going to get promoted because you force a fake friendship with these women. Chances are, they just talk shit about you when you aren't there. There is no benefit to being around them.

Edit: autocorrect, oy"
959,"Accept the school offer (if you want it), and ditch the girl.


Depression doesn't give you the excuse to behave this way.


Who cares if they didn't sleep together? She's emotionally cheated already at this point, and is only imposing this absurd ""3-day probation"" because she got caught. 


Also, the 3 day thing? Fucking stupid. It doesn't take 3 days - all she has to do is so ""no"" to this guy and block his number."
960,"Excuse me? My fiancé also uses reddit, so you need to back off and stop being on the Internet at the same time as him. Home wrecker. "

962,"So OP your mother choose him and his money over you, and now she wants forgiveness because she's is losing access to her husband and her husband's money. Strange that isn't it?
"
963,"Right! The hate here is ridiculous. ""Pete needs to get his shit together"" ""I cannot believe this marriage will last."" All this is based off of what some guy said he was like in high school. I'm sure most people would agree their tastes are different than when they were 18. I'm sure Ella knew Pete liked red heads and in a flurry of emotion thought this was a sensible request. Mistakes happen. We don't have to jump overboard and start berating the groom based off 4th hand facts!"
964,"There is no obligation he has to his ex wife if they've been divorced over 15 years and the kids are fully grown adults.  There is nothing legally holding him to this.  The kids in most states are emancipated upon graduation or 18 years old; which ever longer though some states support if college dependents until age 21. 

There's no reason for him to contact her, give her money or anything.  Same with the kids.  I mean the whole reason of divorce is to end the relationship with that person. 

Your ~~hubby~~ boyfriend needs to go full no contact with her, as the kids are well enough of an age to have a 1:1 relationship with their father, unless I'm missing something?"
965,I hope the real father is located soon and he can move with the baby out of state.
966,"So you'd rather support a man who uses money to hold the sexuality of a young woman to ransom?

Her integrity will go unfettered by lying to a controlling misogynist for her own happiness and opportunity, honestly."
967,I think you're going to have to start believing in divorce.
968,"Sometimes plans/expectations don't line up with reality. Maybe he thought he'd want a large family when it was just talk, but the reality of the amount of work that goes into just one kid hit him hard. It sucks when you're no longer on the same page but it happens a lot.

You have to decide which is more important: having another kid, or keeping the family you have now."
969,"OMG, that explanation just pisses me off.  It's not even "" he was abusive and kept my medication from me, and I've just now gotten the strength to leave him""  it's, ""having you around would have been kinda of hard"".

Fuck. That. "

I wish I hadn't. It wasn't worth it. The whole thing is way overrated especially if you've got a good thing in front of you now. You don't want to give that up, go screw around only to realize.... ""oh... wow... yeah... that wasn't worth it"" But by then she is already gone."

I would hope they would be pretty responsive. If I were them, I would instantly apologize and fall over myself to return something sentimental like that... Though, I can't imagine taking them in the first place."
989,"After a few months of perusing r/relationships, I've determined that men+video games=women+social media."
990,"I don't know whether she misunderstood or it was explained to her wrong or misleadingly.

OP the police have a fair degree of choice on whether they arrest or charge for domestic violence (and in fact are heavily criticised for not exercising the ability to choose to arrest often enough). They most certainly aren't required to show up and arrest someone over a broken photo frame in any state I'm aware of the laws and practices in*. If you were told that happened I would be skeptical. You also have the option of going to Greg's court date to support him and your sister, and what actually happened will be discussed there.

\* As has been pointed out below some states have mandatory arrest legislation (generally developed in response to the above mentioned criticisms the police don't do enough). This doesn't require arrest and charge on every single callout/accusation. The police are still broadly required to genuinely believe on the evidence to hand that domestic violence has occurred to arrest and charge. 

While I could go into the background of criticisms of application of mandatory arrest provisions by police it is probably sufficient to say that they would have had to be exceptionally zealous and inflexible to go from one broken frame to arrest (generally what makes police respond like that is the person they arrest being a pita in some way and police want a reason to remove them from the situation, but that's pure speculation). Usually there needs to be more than that to establish a reasonable belief that DV has occurred.  Perhaps Greg's case is the exception to the usual application of these laws, but it isn't particularly likely. The most reasonable assumption is that more happened than OP knows about that did do enough to justify an arrest and charge, because that's how it goes 99.99% of the time. "
991,"Why on earth would 70 people leave a party to search for one adult who had decided (of her own accord) to leave? All that warranted was an ""oh she mustn't have been feeling well, better ring her husband so he can check up on her"" and to continue with the festivities.

You made the scene every bit as much as your sister did."
992,"OK, I really try not to be the person instantly saying ""Dump him/her"", but... dump this asshole!!  He's going to drive you into an eating disorder.  In addition, he has severe contempt for you and no interest in seeing the problem, let alone fixing it.  I can't link, but you should google the study that found contempt and eye-rolling to be one of the strongest predictors of divorce (I know you aren't married, but speaking in terms of behaviors/attitudes that kill relationships).

I guarantee that as soon as this guy is out of your life and you aren't subjected to his nagging and criticism on a daily basis, you WILL feel 100 pounds lighter without so much as an extra second spent in the gym."
993,Dude. That's emotional abuse. Don't you fucking dare. 
994,"Honestly who really knows what drives people to do these things. 

My ex husband left me for someone 10 years younger than me that he swore up and down they were ' just friends' and had a workplace mentor/mentee thing going. BS. They're engaged now. I literally feel like I never really knew him. 

I'm sorry you are going through this! It's cliche to say it gets better but it does. I am now a year and a few months removed from my divorce and my life is amazing. I have an amazing BF. I have re-connected with old friends and formed new ones too. Hang in there!"
995,"&gt;So she went and took a prenatal paternity test (after collecting my hair from my pillows or some shit like that). 

I am not a doctor, but I'm fairly certain they need a blood sample from you and that takes a decent chunk of time (longer than 3 weeks).

&gt; But when I accused her of it, she started crying and saying stuff like ""if you really loved me then you'd want to raise this child with me"" 

She didn't even deny your accusation?"
996,So you basically isolate yourself and then complain that you're alone?
997,"Alternatively, maybe the wife has been in some sketchy situations involving nudity/people actually exposing themselves predatorily, and is extra touchy about it?

998,"I'm fairly certain they are about us. My sister isn't very discreet when she yells ""They keep doing x,y and z""

We live in a 4 bedroom house and we do get out of the house quite often. We're actually gone for most of the day until around 7pm when its time for dinner.

We play sports and we've been spending a lot of time at the library while we prepare for our summer courses.

I don't think we'll have time for a job but we're definitely out of the house and we give them tons of free time.

1003,"Whenever I went out with the boys, sometimes girls would slip me their number.  I always threw it away.  Bars really aren't the best place to meet someone to just ""be friends"".  I don't think having a boundary like this is unreasonable at all.  "
1004,"Yeah, probably because they are desperate to make some sort of connection with their detached, uninvested mother that only cares about that stuff and refuses to celebrate their own interests."
1005,"It's hard, but flat out say ""Rubbing my shoulders/innuendos/whatever specific thing is making me uncomfortable.  Let's focus on (task at hand).""  That way there's no way the person can 'misread your signals.' 

Don't worry about their comfort.  It is not rude or bitchy to keep the class room professional.  And, if you think about it, a lot of creepy dudes are creepy because no one calls them out on it.  As long as you aren't intentionally hurtful, you're doing yourself and these guys a favor.

I'm a 30 year old woman and I can tell you this approach works."
1006,"Yeah, that squicked me out too. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was just being honest with us about his knee jerk reaction, until I got to:

&gt;Am I justified keeping the photos for myself (including the nude photos of the bridesmaids?) 

NO, you are not justified in jerking off to photos of your SIL and wife's best friend that they may not even realize you have. Ew."
1007,"My hippy upbringing may show through here, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with nudism.

1010,"&gt; therapists never worked on my sister, so I don't see how they'll work for me.

Your situations are entirely different. She didn't think she needed help. You do. She needed to change her behavior. You need help with how you feel about being the victim of someone else's behavior.

&gt; I feel like utter garbage for not knowing that they didn't know.

I don't think you should feel like garbage. It's pretty surprising they didn't know. Unless your sister was a master of only being violent when they weren't around *and* you never mentioned it to your parents, they probably didn't know because they didn't want to know. "

1013,"&gt; she said our future SIL reminded her exactly of those girls who used to tease her for them at school and make her hate her own body

She feels that way because your SIL **is** one of those girls.  She’s a hateful little bully.

&gt; if her problem isn't really with the fiance, then there's no reason she can't go to the wedding

The fact that your sister has a history of being bullied and abused does not lessen the fact that your SIL is an abusive bully who takes pleasure in causing your sister pain.  Stop trying to minimize/excuse SIL's abusive behavior.

&gt; maybe fiance wasn't breastfed as a baby and this was her way of taking out her anger?

Ha!  Your sister is right, that's weird, and also wrong.  Your SIL acts this way because, I repeat, she's a bully, and takes pleasure in hurting your sister.  She elevates herself by dragging other people down.

&gt; I suggested maybe she could wear something really revealing that accentuated her figure, just to mess with the fiance and fuck with everyone.

A woman who's been harassed and made to feel ashamed of her body would be extremely uncomfortable being put on display and leered at.  Your suggestion was crude, inappropriate, and not funny.  Learn this lesson early:  It's not a joke if you're the only one laughing.  I'm sure your SIL thinks her abusive comments and the hurt feelings they cause are *hilarious*.

&gt; I told her what the fuck was her problem, I said to her face that she's a terrible person and she's just coming into our house and accusing my sister of being a liar and a slut and she should get the fuck out she's not welcome here any more.

*This* is what a good brother does.  She doesn't have it in her to stand up for herself because she has internalized all these hateful comments and her self-esteem has been battered down so far she feels she deserves it in some way.  She doesn't, and needs to know that she has support.

&gt; If needed, we'll maintain relations with our brother in the future but only if his wife isn't there.

It isn't needed.  He chose her, let him feel the consequences of that choice.

&gt; They both said we have every right to hate her, but they would still prefer if we went along to the wedding, as a final gesture, just for formality's sake in front of the extended family. 

They only care about showing the facade of a happy family.  Appearances mean more than their children's comfort in this scenario.  Don't be surprised if they continue pleading with you to suck it up and pretend to be happy at all other major events where extended family are present.  Consider strongly whether you want to set the precedent now.  If you don't attend, come up with an acceptable excuse for your parents to give should extended family ask about your absences, that will placate them in regard to appearances.

&gt; I told her not to do that, not everyone will hate her for them or treat her negatively for them. I told her some guys might even like her more because of them and they might make her future husband very happy, the only worry was that they'll get more attention than her. She was like ""again, that's weird and slightly disturbing coming from you."" but we just laughed about it.

You have a bad habit of resorting to crude humor with your sister.  She doesn't like it.  She'll fake a smile and laugh it off and minimize it because that's what she does to everyone else, but *she doesn't like it*.  Please stop.  She has enough people treating her like her value lies in her tits and treating her like a sexual object.  You don't need to be one of them.

&gt; She was contemplating going just as a formality, but she thought her presence there will be a victory for our brother's fiance, and she might even use the opportunity to humiliate her or berate her in one of her cruel ways.

She will.

&gt; I told her maybe if I could get a promise out of her that she wouldn't, or an apology, would she then come. 

The last time SIL agreed to play nice she didn't make it one day.  Why have you not learned this lesson yet?  How much more false smiles and backhanded compliments and outright abuse must your sister endure before you accept that SIL is a bad person and will not change just because you ask?

&gt; However, again we spoke to our parents, and they again said they would really appreciate if we did go, and we wouldn't have to speak to the bride and groom at all, we can just stay seated at our table for most of the night if we want to.

The entire purpose of attending a wedding is to support the bride and groom in their commitment to one another.  You don't even like these people.  And this isn't going to happen.  Your parents will make all the promises in the world to get you to come to the wedding, because not attending will make them look bad.  But you're not going to be able to just sit at the table.  There will be something.  Maybe during the photos, where you'll be expected to stand together and look like such a happy family, where SIL will no doubt make some hurtful comment and your sister will still be expected to smile for the camera, because *appearances*.  Or maybe SIL has some equally cruel friends who will decide to come sit with you and berate your sister in her stead.  Or maybe the harpy will take time out of her special evening to come directly to you, and it's not as though you'll be allowed to walk away, because *appearances*.  

This is a terrible idea and you're both going to be miserable if you attend the wedding."
1014,"Your kids could give two shits about their rooms or their clothes.

But having you celebrate their achievements actually *matters* to them.

Wow. So this is what the inner monologue of a narcissist looks like. It's pretty fascinating actually."
1015,"&gt;  He wanted a well laid out explanation for her and for her to have a chance to ask me any questions and air out her concerns so I can address them now rather than her coming to me with them later. 

And there are ways to do this that don't involve a dinner date and her walking you to your car and **kissing you**. That's when you should have pushed her away and asked if she even heard a single word you said.

Like I said before, you seem to have the right general idea, but little in the way of follow-through. But obviously this is still very new for you, so hopefully this is just the momentum gradually working the other way."
1016,"&gt; Before I could even go over to clean up and hire a plumber she had gone to the hardware store and then fixed it herself. Same with when her truck broke down and when she needed to repair her fence.

How they hell is that a problem?

&gt; She is my girlfriend and I would happily help her pay her bills or give her money for shopping sometimes

That's not what boyfriends normally do. It's one thing to pay for dates, but you don't just give them money. And if she wants to split dates or alternate who pays that's awesome.

&gt; I know she cares about me but I went on a fishing trip and she only called or texted every other day. She said it was because she didn't want to bother me and wanted me to enjoy time with my friends. The other guys I with who are in relationships were getting contact multiple times a day.

I pity those men. If I'm out of town away from my wife we usually talk or text once a day. Two would be OK. Every other day would be OK with me too.

&gt; Even if I go out for wing night there is radio silence and she didn't even question the time I went to a place with exotic dancers for my buddy's stag, she just told me to have fun.

Again, not seeing the problem. 

&gt; She will also stay home if I'm out with my friends and she doesn't have plans and will not ask to join us.

Maybe she wants to hang out at home.

&gt; Also she doesn't like to complain to me ever or anything even though I have said she is welcome to use me as a sounding board anytime. I know she has had stuff going on that most people would complain about (like a stressful day at work) but she doesn't want to and just says she would spend our time together enjoying ourselves.

She sounds better and better.

Being in a relationship is about spending time with someone you care about whose company you enjoy. It's not about needing someone. Your girlfriend sounds happy and well adjusted. If you decide you don't want to be with her there will be guys lining up to date someone so awesome.

1017,"&gt; her thunder has been stolen by me buying a house with my boyfriend in February     
&gt; thought me buying a house would be enough for awhile         

It sounds like your sisters have this bizarre, made-up system where the three of you are supposed to ""take turns"" being in the spotlight. The comment about the house ""being enough for a while"" and ""stealing her thunder"" seem an awful lot like implying, ""you've had enough attention from the family for now, it's my turn!""     

This is immature and selfish behavior on their part; don't lend any credence to it, and don't try to schedule your own milestones around the small pockets of time that they won't be offended at positive changes in your life. It won't stop at ""don't get engaged the same year of my wedding"", soon it will be things like ""you can't plan for a child within 2 years of me having a baby"" or ""how dare you upgrade to a better house when I won't have the money to do so for 5 years"".     

You've mentioned that they have ""tried to act like mothers and run your life"" in the past. Disregarding their antics and moving forward with your engagement shows them that for all their complaining, you're an independent adult and their 'rules' change nothing. They can either be mature adults and celebrate with you, or be miserable all by themselves.      

You're about to be engaged, don't let them diminish what is a very exciting time for you. Keep on living your life. Enjoy your new house, and time with your future husband. If they can't be glad just for the fact that your life is going great; if they're going to sulk because your happiness isn't going according to THEIR plan, then that's their failing as siblings, not yours. "
1018,"The political correctness of the sub pisses me off.

$150 is not a lot of money for anyone in the western world.
I don't care what the job if you can't afford $150 you have a long hard road ahead of you.

You're an idiot for going ahead with an engagement, even moving in.

But judging from your responses, which might even be a troll, you will learn the hard way.

Far too stubborn with absolutely no clue about the real world.

Sorry someone had to lay it out there."
1019,"Have you considered Izzy might also be having a hard time adjusting to her personality diverging significantly from her sister's?  By your own words, they've always done everything together, and now suddenly they are worlds apart.  It doesn't help that Sam is conforming to gender norms- even though it's by her own choice, it is a LOT less fraught with conflict than the path Izzy has chosen.  There could easily be some jealousy over Sam having things ""easier"" because she is naturally more suited to these social expectations.

Furthermore, she sees you endorsing and rewarding Sam's behavior with all of these mother/daughter trips, while Izzy mostly seems to get exhaustion and criticism from you.  It's not enough to invite her along.  I know you've tried asking her to suggest some activities, but she's 16 and she feels alienated by her family.  It might be more productive for you to do the planning.  Or for her to do some things with her father, or both of you.

Lashing out specifically at her sister for not following Izzy's version of feminism sounds as much like an expression of this underlying pain as it does self-righteous.  (It's definitely both IMO.)

Izzy's attitude obviously needs to be addressed.  She can't treat her sister or her parents like this, or frankly her teachers, classmates, or anyone else who might be exposed to her strict beliefs.  But it's my experience that unless you can get to the real root causes of such behavior, it is impossible to correct.

When I was Izzy's age, I had moments like this, though my beliefs then were not as extreme or black-and-white.  It was sometimes hard for me to feel respectful of others' beliefs when I lived in a community that was constantly and incessantly disrespectful of mine.  It wasn't that they were always doing it to me directly; it's more like it was just assumed everyone thought the same way, and it led to opinions/attitudes being discussed casually, every day, in school, at home, out in public, at work which were like fingernails on a chalkboard to me, paired with a lot of derision for people who did share my beliefs.  And sometimes dealing with that boiled over in unhealthy ways.

The thing my family didn't really understand was how deeply personal all these issues were to me.  To them, homophobia (for example) was an academic debate.  To me, it was my best friend coming out to me as bisexual the day before I had to sit through a homophobic sermon at church.  It wasn't ""homosexual people are sinners""; it was ""this girl you love like a sister is going to hell for something she can't help"".  For me, a bra was a prison representing the mountain of shit that landed on my head at the onset of puberty, punishment for losing a genetic lottery, and to them it was a female undershirt.  That missed understanding feels like a very real and painful lack of support to a teenager."
1020,"You yourself said ""terrified of getting married because my partner could destroy my life"".  Well this is why people get prenups.  Your GF is making a pretty reasonable call here.  Just make it part of the marriage paperwork.  It's not a big deal and won't ""spoil"" your marriage."
1021,"It isn't illegal to sleep with a prof, and at most universities it isn't against policy if you have no influence over that student either (though usually frowned upon) I'd look up your university's policy.

1023,"I guess you could say she's selectively racist and she hides behind ignorance, and she's very much ok with other things if she likes them, so she gets away with it when she acts that way. I think her husband sees her act this way about everything she doesn't like (like gardening) so he kind of accepts it and moves on."

1025,"Dress your mom's partner as a man and re-enact The Bird Cage. I'm joking, I'm joking!

&gt; Gaby pleaded for me to reconsider because it's important for her parents to have some sort of relationship with my family too if their daughter and I are gonna be together. 

If Gaby's parents want to have a relationship with your family, then that's all the more reason for you to bring *your family* around to visit. If her parents have decided they can't accept their daughter dating the son of lesbian moms, then everyone might as well face the music now.

&gt; She said that she will eventually tell her parents about my moms when we're more established as a couple

So she's suggesting you both lie to her parents for what I'm guessing is a few years at least. She expects you (and your mother) to keep up this charade, only to turn around and say, ""Now that we're engaged, it's time to admit that we have been lying to you for years."" I imagine that a long-term lie would be more upsetting to her parents than the truth.  

I understand Gaby is scared, but lying is not the way out of this situation. Either her parents will learn to accept that they might have a same-sex couple as future in-laws, or they won't and Gaby will have to deal with the consequences. She's an adult, it's not like they can prevent her from continuing a relationship with you (at least not after she moves out). But if her parents can't accept your parents, then it's up to you and Gaby to decide whether you're interested in continuing a relationship with *them*. 

Tell Gaby to sit her parents down (before the BBQ) and tell her parents the truth. Go with her if you need to. But it's up to her to tell them the truth, as it sounds like she's been misleading her parents. 

And seriously, watch The Bird Cage. It's pretty much the exact same scenario.

He doesn't see it because he wakes up and goes to work at the same time, but doesn't understand that he spends 1hr at the gym and has a full extra day off? 

I would:
bring out a calendar and fill out his hours and your hours so he can clearly see the distinction. Google calendars work well for this, make drive time, work time, gym time, chores Etc

Of course he doesn't consider the ""house work"" in his mind because meals are magically done, the house doesn't look dirty and his clothes are clean and dishes clean, not doing chores does not hurt him in anyway so he doesn't consider them in the schedule

Stop doing 90% of the chores unless you always plan on doing them. Why are you cooking his meals and doing all your and his chores? Outline clear chore list and divide the responsibilities. Again a visual do to chore board might need to be used. Once he is responsible for more than just his job he can appreciate how the hours not working are also busy. If he refuses, fine let him live in filth, do your laundry, cook your meals and don't act like his servant.

Two weeks to wrangle up a treadmill and stick to a ""safe food,"" plus all of the actions and comments of the family have me thinking that yes, she has an eating disorder, and has for many years. I think that perhaps she's been recovered for the past couple of years, but between her brother's comments and her mom, it's now all falling apart, and fast."
1031,"Yeah, in my situation the guy didn't even want to talk about why he suddenly looked like he was rethinking marriage altogether. They were on the same page about a big 200+ wedding, halfway through planning it with no arguments at all. This girl is the complete opposite of a bridezilla. Finally he points at the screen and goes ""is this...did she...is this what she really thinks?!"" There was a lot of relief when I laughed and went ""holy shit NO!"" This guy sounds like he's having a similar nervous reaction. "
1032,"Your BF is using the ""equal partnership"" as an excuse to make you the evil GF who is ruining all of his family's hopes and dreams for him.  *He* also doesn't want to get married and have kids yet.  *He* needs to stop making it a battle between you and them when it's his fight.  As for SIL, her sensitivity is her problem. You didn't even know about her ""happy accidents,"" so there is no way you could have been trying to rile her up.  "

1035,"So let me get this straight. A young, clearly disturbed girl came on to your husband, hard, and he shut her down. She then kept coming after him, and he kept shutting her down. I could see hating her if your husband had been tempted, because that would be easier than hating him, but mostly she comes off as damaged and pathetic, hardly a figure worthy of hatred. My guess is that she'll run for the exit the instant she sees you two. 

If you skip the event you will be letting a teenaged girl have power over you. And that sounds really pathetic."

1037,"""Connor, you've made it very clear you don't want to follow the rules of my home, and refuse to show any sort of respect for our family.  You have one month to shape up or move out. Your choice."" The key is not to single out your nephew as the reason you're kicking him out if his attitude doesn't improve. 

As for your girls, take away their hair and beauty products until they shape up. With Connor out of the picture, or hopefully behaving himself, they may stop bullying your nephew. But if not,  their clothes get replaced with bell bottoms and tie dye until they do."
1038,"&gt;My sister never hid her doing that. It was always in the house. I don't know how she didn't see it.

Stop feeling guilty over your parents failure to protect you.  You didn't say the wrong thing, you didn't mess up or hurt your mother.  They were willfully ignorant of what happened to you or knew and chose not to rock the boat and address it.  If your sister was so blatant about it, I highly doubt your mother was clueless.  She's just flipping it on you to divert from the fact she was a bad mother.

1041,"Thats the exact thought that I have. Whats even worse is that she was in a somewhat similar situation with one of her stepdaughters. The stepdaughter was staying at her house (for free, she didn't/doesn't have a job) much longer than originally expected and literally forced my mom to kick her out and it made my mom feel terrible. So, she wants me to do the same thing when it's not even my own living space????? 

About the reassurance thing, I have been, constantly. Because she texts me about three times a day telling me how I should be doing absolutely nothing else but studying, sleeping, and eating. Better be talking to the teacher every single day, make friends in the class but not real friends just use them for help, etc. Like god damn woman "
1042,Not to mention a hypocrite who holds women to different standards than himself? Imagine having a daughter with this guy.
1043,"Personally, I think you are completely right in not wanting a child right now.

You graduate in a year and a half...you have already invested so much time (and money!) into getting your degree.  It's a goal that you have set for yourself and until very recently, he agreed with.  Does he think you'd just be okay with flushing all of that effort down the toilet and leaving whether or not you'll go back to finish as an open-ended topic?  

You need to tell him that you will be finishing school before you try to get pregnant again and if wanting to be married first is important to you, you need to explain to him that you want that solid, legal foundation before you bring a life into this world with him.  Even if it is ""just a piece of paper"", it's a legally binding piece of paper.  Make sure he knows that you absolutely want children with him.  You just need a little bit more time to achieve your personal goals before this happens.  

And, honestly, the two of you also need to sit down and discuss the expectations for how you would raise a child anyway.  It sounds like he might expect you to be a stay-at-home Mom while he works, but it also sounds like you like working...  You two clearly aren't on the same page at all right now."
1044,"That's pretty cheap for a babysitter, a lot of the kids where I live can get 15, maybe 20 if they're really good"
1045,"Is she really your best friend? Besides letting her sleep in your bed, do you find yourself doing things for her that you would not do for a male best friend? The thing is, if you have these pent-up feelings and do special things for this girl, then you are not necessarily being honest about your relationship being purely platonic.

DO NOT dump your feelings on her! Save the whole ""for the past 6 years you have been my one and only...""-nonsense, even if she did have feelings for you that kind of confession puts her in an extremely awkward position and there is no way she could reciprocate.

Ask her out on a date. She'll ask if it's a date-date, and you'll reply, ""Yes.""  She'll say you guys are such good friends, and you'll reply, ""Yes, we've been friends for six years, but I'd like to see if there is any potential outside of platonic friendship."" It's still a gamble, but a much more effective way of conveying your romantic interest without putting this girl on the spot.

If it doesn't work out, you at least tried. Ultimately it's not fair for you to repress your feelings. Conversely, if she knows that you have strong feelings for her and she still strings you along, then she is kind of a shitty person."

Let's get this out of the way  
- Stop asking questions you don't want to know the answer to.  
- The number of partners your partner has had is... a number and nothing more.  
-She's with you and as long as you have no reason to suspect shenanigans on your partner's side, you've absolutely nothing to complain about  
- Your self-pity ""woe is me, she deserves better/more/whatever"" bullshit will become a self-fulfilling prophecy unless you nip that shit in the bud, like yesterday  
-You need to get your head out of your ass and treat your relationship as a match of equals rather than some game where you're playing catch up.  Nothing is less appealing than having your partner tell you how much they rely on you to drag them along.  

Slap in the face time: grow up. Stop the worrying about the past as you have zero control over it. You have the now. Focus there and act like an adult."
1061,"My first thought was that he used you for sex.

I would block him and go no contact. If he reaches out to you, don't reply. Even if he is having family trouble, you don't take a girls virginity and then ghost her, that's such a shitty way to act. Especially if you two agreed to be an item, that's not how you treat your girlfriend."

That said, OP does NOT have that problem. Her fiance is being a huge douche about it. And loads of people DO overuse that expression to gaslight someone about their own fears around getting married. "

If she's not a very light natural blonde or highlights instead of dying from the roots, there's a chance the hairs could be hers. Brown hairs can look a lot darker in isolation, or up against a white sink. She should also consider who *she* works with with hair like that. She could even bring the hairs you find into work and ask folks if they recognize them, while sheepishly explaining that she and her husband have been really creeped out lately. Your son could also have a teacher with hair like that?

In the meantime, be as kind and loving to them as you can, and don't lose your sense of humor.  They will test you, but don't be afraid to set reasonable boundaries and expectations.  Children feel more secure when they have limits."

Honestly, if someone said that about me, I'd spend the rest of the day cheeping at them every time they asked me a question.

If you're in on the joke, the joke isn't funny any more, and they'll get bored. If they keep it up, then that's workplace bullying, and I'd have a chat with the closest responsible manager, or HR. It could be ended with a simple email with the manager or HR cced in."

Each time they get away with a cycle they will have a chance at escalating the abuse. "

There is a big difference between working harder to support the person you love and having a miserable social life in order to *potentially* assist the person you love's career. You're right to be nervous about long-term commitments, and I think you should ask your husband to really consider what the consequences will be: risk-vs-reward, and length of commitment. As another commenter mentioned, you should let him know your membership in the social group is not a favored place, but a person they denigrate, *especially* because you don't put *him* down.

If he was coming to you saying, ""Clearly this isn't working, what can I be doing better"" that would be one thing. Or asking, ""How can I reshape this to make it better?"" that would be another. But he's taking this rejection like someone who thinks he's entitled to greatness because OF COURSE everything that drops out of his brain is golden. 

A real writer thinks everything they write is shit. They are doing everything they can to make it better. 

He just thinks what he wrote is awesome and therefore the idiots in the publishing houses can't see his greatness. 

I just recently quit my PhD in English (long story, not relevant). I was in a bar and someone pulled another guy over who was working on his 'novel'. I asked him like two, very basic questions. Questions like, ""Okay, I get the premise, but where's the conflict?"" He flipped. his. shit. And I just backed away slowly because the only thought in my head was, ""Okay....you don't understand the very basic elements of story telling"". And I'm NOT a creative writer. I still understand the basics of how a story arch functions and the fact that there's NO CONFLICT in your story line is going to be a deal-breaker. What frustrated me is that every serious creative writer I've met would be THRILLED to hear a question like that because they are thinking about these things just like I am. They'd want to talk me to death. If you're pissed off by very basic, very relevant questions then this is just vanity and narcissism (not the clinical kind, the regular kind). That's fine, but you take that shit to the A03 and publish it as fanfic....because that's what you're writing.

1108,"*WARNING: CHILD DEVELOPMENT THEORY, POLITICS, MORALS, ETC.*

I don't think your wife is wrong. I also don't think you did anything that you should feel bad about. I think this is a legitimate disagreement with important points on both sides, and you guys just need to talk about it and find a compromise. This is a confusing issue, but I'll try to explain my views on both sides, especially hers. 

My parents never allowed me to play with toy guns either. I hated them for it. I lusted after toy guns as a kid. I could think of nothing more exciting.

Now, I'm an adult who has mixed feelings about it. I enjoy a good game of Red Dead Redemption on my Xbox (bought when I was an adult, lol) from time to time, and I love a good game of laser tag. At the same time, I work at a nonprofit that teaches non-violent conflict resolution to kids, and student-teach in a preschool that discourages 'weapon play,' for good reasons. And I'm really, really scared at how easily our culture normalizes violence, especially gun violence, to children. I can't deny that it freaks me out a little to see kids actually excited and jazzed about guns, even though that was me as a kid and, honestly, still is a little me now. 

Your wife's argument is familiar to me because I heard it a million times growing up, and still believe a lot of it now. Let me try and summarize it in a way that might be more accessible to you:

-Bottom line, I think real guns are horrible. They are literally made to kill and hurt other people and things, and I don't think anyone should have them except for people who hunt, farmers who need to protect their land, and special police, the way it is in most of Europe. I totally understand wanting to protect one's family, and there is nothing morally wrong with wanting to own a gun for this purpose, but you're more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder and are better off owning a stun gun or a taser. Curbing our culture's fascination with guns would literally save tens of thousands of lives a year (gun violence deaths in America are 30k+ yearly). Not every kid who plays with guns will grow up to own one, but this culture where we treat guns as fun, exciting, cool, and a ""game"" for kids allows them to grow up to be grown men who like guns, own guns, and shoot guns--in a safe way, of course, but having a gun around the house often leads to suicides and accidental shootings. And unfortunately, when you combine this mentality with a serious mental illness, that's when you get massacres. None of this is going to be solved by you not giving your kid a toy gun, but if all the parents in the country stopped giving all their kids toy guns, the world would be a better place, you know?

-The line between fantasy and reality is really, really blurry for some kids. That doesn't mean that your kid will go shoot up his school after playing cowboys and indians with you. But it does mean that, if he were to somehow get his hands on a real gun at a friend's house where the parents don't lock the guns up safely (god forbid!) he might treat it like a toy and hurt someone else, or himself. Plenty of examples of kids doing this literally every day, sadly. More likely, it may just freak him out and give him nightmares. 

-This is beyond the guns, but at a really young age where kids are still developing, playing games that involve being violent to get the things you want (or for fun) can really train you to think that the way to get the things you want is to hurt or threaten people. Again, this isn't just toy guns, but literally every TV show and lots of the resulting schoolyard mimicry. That doesn't mean every kid who learns that violence is a tool to solve problems grows up to shoot people, but the fact that so many kids learn fighting is the way to get what you want is probably responsible for a lot of bullying, bar brawls and domestic violence. That said, if you set a good example for your son by treating others with respect and modeling constructive problem-solving skills, you're doing more good than playing with a toy gun could ever undo.

Bottom line, very little of my (and I bet her) objection is about the gun itself, but what it represents--a wildly and stupidly and meanly violent world that our kids are being taught to accept and play into (by the media, by their friends, etc), with sad consequences. It's a damn shame that so many adults hurt each other, and it's a damn shame kids play games where they pretend to hurt each other, and it's a damn lie to think that there's not any causal relationship between those things on a societal level, even if your average cowboy and indian didn't grow up to be a serial killer. 

The counterpoint was given to me by one of my beloved college professors, who has been in education for decades. She is a classic left-wing 60s hippie, Sarah Lawrence degree and all, so you would expect her to be vehemently anti-guns-for-children. But she explained it to me this way:

-First, when we deny something to kids, it makes them want it all the more. Refusing to let them play with guns just makes them more and more excited about guns. It turns them from an interesting object into a forbidden object, and forbidden objects are much more fun and enthralling to kids than interesting ones. So trying to prevent 'gun play' just turns into a constant battle about the gun, when the goal is to stem children's fascination with guns in the first place.

-Second, play is a time for kids to work through their feelings. And kids have a lot of feelings of frustration, powerlessness, anger, fear, and frustration with a world they don't fully understand and can't control. Gun play is often a way of either releasing some of their pent-up rage and anger, or allowing them to pretend to have some power in a world where they have none. Same for children who pretend to be monsters, or good guys and bad guys, or ferocious wild animals. Gun play isn't motivated by a desire to hurt and kill but by a developmentally-appropriate desire to be angry, loud, and powerful. It does not in any way mean that kids will grow up to be murderers, in the same way that kids who play princesses don't grow up to be princesses. 

-Third, you can't really prevent gun play, even if you try. If you take the toy guns away, kids will make guns out of their hands. If you tell them to stop making guns with their hands, they'll tell you ""it's a flashlight."" You can't ban pretend flashlights, so you can't effectively ban pretend guns.

Anyway. All this to say:

This isn't one of those clear situations where one of you is right and one is wrong. You want to pass down treasured, fun childhood memories, which I highly doubt will scar his psyche in any way. She sees that he's going out into a painfully violent world one day and wants to show him that it is 100% not okay.  

Both beliefs and concerns are valid, both approaches have merit. In the end, this is truly a personal parenting decision that you have to make in accordance with your values. So talk about it and compromise, but present a united front. The worst thing would be for your son to think he could play like this with you even if mom wasn't okay with it. It allows the seven-year-old to make the parenting decisions when mom and dad disagree, which is not a good precedent to set.

Hope that was helpful. Could have been nonsense. Best wishes and good luck."
1109,"Why does being capable of taking on a challenge mean that challenge has to be financial? Frankly, taking up your parents on their offer could be viewed as a challenge because it gives you no excuse not to do your very best in your new job. Why don't you try redefining what it means to be independent in your own mind. Did you get your trainee position yourself? Did you pass through school yourself? Will you succeed professionally on your own merit? If these things are true, aren't you independently successful?

It sounds to me that you feel guilty about being privileged. This makes some sense, though not everyone feels this way about privilege. I agree with others who suggest you save your money and do something meaningful with it. I bet that would make you feel better than handing money over to some faceless landlord who is probably privileged too. "

1114,Totally. It's refreshing to see OPs approach. I admire her ability to stay true to what she believes.
1115,Plan B is just being prudent. Now if she has a back up BF in mind that is different. But given you had voiced some doubts to her already it is not crazy to consider a Plan B.
1116,"I think what OP might be trying to say is that if her son wants to take AP classes or specialized programs those would not be available to him since students have already picked classes. This is just a guess, though, and I agree completely that the public schools are obligated to take him if they live in the district."
1117,"Good Questions. 


(1) Don't think so. They have always been extremely supportive, plus they kind of put a lot of pressure on me to succeed so I think they are just proud of me.


(2) I initially thought about this but most of my siblings had homes at my age, I might have even been the latest.


(3) After looking through both inspections, the one when they sold and the most recent one--everything was pretty much covered. 


Still not really sure how to go about getting them to talk to me. "
1118,"Believe that I'm not (shits still going down). Of course she showed up like nothing was wrong, came to me for kisses and I could smell the weed on her breath. I'm just like uhhh whatcha doin. Told her that she treats me like absolute garbage, and she had no idea how I came to that conclusions. Will update more later"
1119,"I think it's super cool that you're still looking for ways to interact with a difficult child - parenting is hard as shit and the fact you're still willing says a lot about the kind of mother you both are, and want to be. Frankly, teens are rough. I remember my mother always saying to me at age 13 ""your older brother didn't act like this, what's up with you?"" Turns out his Terrible Teens came on at 18. Hopefully it won't be the same with Sam but it's worth keeping in mind that hormonal angsty phases are usually par for the course with young people.

For something to do with Izzy, I'd suggest maybe introducing her to a space in which she can creatively vent her frustrations but also be surrounded by a community who can expose her to different perspectives. Do you live in a city which has a Spoken Word Poetry scene? Slam Poetry and Open Mic Poetry events are huge right now and because so many different people use that platform to share their thoughts, vulnerabilities, and personal politics, you could go to an event together and then discuss afterwards the stories people onstage have shared, which ones moved you, which ones you disagreed with, etc. A lot of cities even have Poetry Collectives for young people which she could get involved with, so she can express her opinions in an artistic (rather than adversarial) way, and because those collectives make the young'uns workshop their ideas, they actually have people challenging them in a more gentle, collaborative way. That could be really helpful for her to learn how to be contradicted without bristling, and also will help her make friends with other likeminded young people.

See if your local university or city council is running any events like lectures from feminist thinkers and whatnot. Maybe look into joining a book club together and read the books when you're at the hairdresser (added bonus that she has to express her ideas and opinions in an adult space, which requires her to think more tactfully on how to present her opinions). 

When I was in debating club as a teenager, we'd often have interschool debates on a weekly or fortnightly basis. Ask her if anything like that exists for you to come along and see her in action.

On the media front - if you like, I can ask some people what might be good feminist TV/movie content for you to broach with her? My obvious thoughts are Broad City (very funny and intelligent TV show which lovingly mocks people who take those types of politics too seriously whilst also acknowledging the legitimacy of their complaints - but also quite explicit in themes a lot of the time so up to your personal taste) and Crazy Ex Girlfriend (which is a musical-style sitcom that is told from the perspective of a very smart and talented female lawyer who puts all her emotional stock in a man to make her happy, and is very subversive and clever in the way it turns the trope of ""Crazy Ex Girlfriend"" on its head). I've also heard Jessica Jones is amazing and inspiring, but I haven't seen it yet."
1120,"She just got out of what seems to be an abusive relationship. Abusive relationships mess with a person's mentality and they often ""trained"" by the abuser that everything is their fault and they are an awful person because ""Look at how angry you made me. This is your fault. YOU made me act like this.""                 

She brought a person into your life that physically assaulted you. In a sense she did create the situation that led to your injury. That's how she thinks about it.               

She needs time to heal. She needs time to relearn how non-abused people see the world. Tell her ""You aren't responsible for his actions. He made the choice to hit me because he is an awful person. I made the choice to get the cardigan. You need to stop blaming yourself for this."" The fact you only did it because she begged you will obviously bring more guilt, but just breeze over that."
1121,"He didn't mention that he said to her, ""Hey I know we are having a serious discussion right now but my father is being rushed to the hospital so I have to go."" Any reasonable person, especially someone who has been by your side for eight years, will *totally* understand that whatever conversation is happening at that moment immediately gets postponed. It sounds to me like they were arguing, he got that text from his sister, and was like ""That's it, I'm out."" From the gf's point of view, he was walking out on their conversation for no good reason."

1127,"Wth regards to your side-note about flirting-- take this as a very small lesson in what flirting with everyone you meet can lead to. (I know Amar could have gotten fixated on you sans flirting, but I'd be surprised if this is the first issue you've had like this, and the flirting is a part of it)

Even if you know you don't mean anything by it, and even if you make it known that you flirt with everyone, plenty of people are going to get the wrong idea. There will be the Amars that hope and act like they are the exception and that you are flirting with them out of actual interest. There will be the SOs of the people you flirt with that will be very uncomfortable. There will be people in your professional environment who take this kind of behavior very poorly.

I'd start getting used to being friendly in ways that don't come across as flirting, because that's something you'll need as it becomes more necessary for you to mature out of the ""flirting with everyone is acceptable"" mentality.

He is the most important person in my life. I still have a backup plan if he were to be kidnapped by aliens/leave me/hit by a bus/etc. I know he has one as well.

Mention how flirty and territorial she was. Mention that you don't think he is to blame or that he is being deceitful, but that you don't trust her because of the way you've witnessed her interacting with him. If he doesn't back off, then I'm not sure what to tell you. At that point, he isn't respecting you."
1137,"Well. Kind of. I was suggesting more of what *you* use around her mom, not her.      
Anyway it's not important to her mom so much as its another thing she can control. Narcissists want little clones, honestly. So her daughter disagreeing with her is a Big Deal because her daughter *isn't allowed* to disagree with her or form opinions that clash with her mom's opinions.     

Seriously, OP. Watch after that kid. This is just the beginning."
