"I'm not grossed out by penises, if I was, I wouldn't masturbate or watch heterosexual porn. It's not disgust for the male body that makes me straight, it's the disgust for the idea of being another man's lover.  "
"Bought and wrapped my own Christmas presents and put them under the tree, just so I had something to open on Christmas. : (

Edit: This really blew up guys, thanks for everyone that messaged and told me happy birthday.
To be clear, we do have a awesome relationship. This is just me venting ok, I'm not looking to get divorced or anything super drastic. I'm going to talk to him.

Edit: ya'll are too kind."
"It's not just about vaginas vs dicks, its also about the feel of a woman. The way that women are soft and curvy and smooth in more places than men, that their hair is long and their asses and breasts are round. As well as the way they act differently from guys.  

Don't get me wrong, I love a good looking vag, but it's not all about the genitals. Sometimes it's about the combination of attributes that makes women different from dudes. "
"Made cards and other craft projects stuff, cute and time consuming but made me feel bland "
"Not a man, but a woman who has grown up in the south. Let me tell you. Other people may have their reasons, but down here, the good ol' boys don't do it JUST because it's the fucking funniest gotdamn thing they've ever seen, but because it's a status symbol. You don't put truck nutz on your little Toyota Tacoma, no sir. In fact, truck nutz are like the tassel on your high school graduation cap. There's a whole load of classes you gotta make it through first. You've gotta have an American-made truck (or Tahoe, which is truck enough) with a tow package--that's the easy part. You've also gotta have a brush guard, hunting spotlights (gun rack optional, but preferred) a lift kit (""The bigger the lift, the higher to God"") and winch, some sort of ""_____ life"" decal on the rear window (""Salt"" if you're from Florida, ""Huntin'"" or ""Mud"" anywhere else) and some mid-range sound system that makes every girl yell ""turn that shit down!"" 

Then, after your truck is assembled, you and at least three other friends must ritualistically hang the truck nutz proudly from the bumper while drinking Natty Lite. The nutz must then be christened, much like the time young good ol' boy ""explored"" his cousin out behind the barn--the nutz must be muddied. If rain has been sparse that season, driving on dirt roads will suffice, but the nutz must be muddied within one years time. 

Once this has occurred, you can graduate and enter the real world, where you are officially a real, red-blooded American man. These truck nutz are a treasure. A day will come when a man, too old and brittle to be climbing and extra foot into his truck simply to drive it to the pharmacy to get his blood pressure medicine, will pass his truck nutz on to his son. That son has a legacy to uphold, and those metal testicles will be a constant reminder of the man he is destined to become.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, my friends!"
"i once drove around town for 2-3 hours on my birthday so i could come back and lie to my parents that i'd hung out with friends. i didn't want them feeling bad for me if i'd spent my entire birthday alone in my room - which i wouldn't have been bothered by at all if i did do that, i just didn't want them to be sad or anything."
You likely That! You ducking regard! 
"I like vaginas because they are great for putting your penis in.

I hate penises because they are really terrible for putting your penis in."
"Yes, especially if they are stretching and their shirt pulls up and uncovers their belly. Just makes you imagine them naked. As others have said though, not if they are fat."
"She used the word ""Mansplaining"" to complain about that time her landlord had told her to pick up her hair after showering, after he had to unclog the drain.

Lost all respect for her."
She's a cutie patootie 24/7
"Group camping trip.  We had been in the ""hanging out"" phase for a while.  We had been ""hanging out"" a lot lately.  I offered to help her set up her tent.  She said she hadn't brought one.  She didn't say she *forgot*, she just said ""I didn't bring one.""  Yeah you know where this is going.  Like the chivalrous but clueless virgin I was, I totally showed off my badass wilderness skillz by constructing a lean-to for myself so she could use my tent! My god, it's a miracle my people have managed to get dicks in vaginas enough to have propagated our kind all the way to 2016.

Don't worry, she forgave my cluelessness.  At the end of the night I was spreading my sleeping bag out under my (totally kickass) lean-to, and she walked up, grabbed it, threw it into the tent, and said ""Don't be a dumbass."" "
"In the last few weeks as my wife was slowly dying from stomach cancer after a two and a half year battle, I asked to record her. She wanted me to leave the room and I took our 2yo (at the time) outside to play. I didn't see the videos until years later because it hurt too much to even try. This took me years to get over, but three years ago as I was in a bad place, I watched them. They gave me the strength to not give up, no matter what.

In her four little 1 minute movies, she told me she loved me and could feel my love for her and asked me to be happy. She said she wanted to make a happy life together but if she couldn't then she'd try to do it in other ways. She asked our son and I to never forget her and to get double happiness out of life if possible: happiness for each of us and happiness for her. I actually do this every day. When I go shopping, I can still hear her voice *""don't choose expensive, don't choose cheap, choose what you want""*. It makes me smile but then it also makes me cry and break down again. It's sweet pain.

I showed these to our (now) 16yo son and they are invaluable to us. Now, my son and I have her in our minds every time we try to do something, even if we fail (and fail we do plenty). But we know that there's more to life that we can see. Every time we see 11:11 or 222 or 555, we feel she is talking to us.

This gives us strength and keeps her in our hearts, because to me that's what life is about. She's also the reason behind me trying to create a massive social change effort, one that the world is against me but one that I've found was incredibly useful in understanding her at a much deeper level, without having to be told or having to ask."
Valentines day was coming.
His last name didn't go with my first name (think Julia Gulia) so there was no point in pursuing it further.
Man you women think up the craziest shit to be worried about.
"I'm still young (19) but I think framing it as great vs. average is only ever going to lead to disappointment. I mean who decides whether you're great or average? Why do you need their validation?

As long as I make my own way in life, stick to my principles and experience life as much as I can I'll be happy. 

**Edit:** Find your own standards, your own values to live by. "
"&gt; she walked up, grabbed it, threw it into the tent, and said ""Don't be a dumbass.""

This was the perfect end to the story. Go her."
47. I'm 46 now and optimistic. 
"I've always believed that when people get married they should both ditch their last names for a new, far more awesome last name.  Like John Johnson and Jill Wilson would become John &amp; Jill Bearstabber."
"You give yourself a hand job, you faggot. "
"dreamt she got obese, could never look at her the same again. "

I'm going to do the same thing I did for international women's day. Nothing. 
"I watch a lot of PBS and their breaks between programs are like minute long mini-fundraisers that end by thanking donors for making a contribution to the station with a simple ""thank you"". 

This guy, without fail, would say ""you're welcome"" back to the screen...every...single...time. 

Oh, and his smoke alarm was constantly chirping for new batteries. 

ETA: I am actually pretty into bad humor and not nearly as uptight as this post sounds! Just one of those weird things that coupled with other things just make you go Nancy Kerrigan whyyyyyyyy world.
"
"A girl in high school kept saying stuff like ''If I keep talking to you, my friends will think that we are dating'' or ''My mom saw us and taught that you are my boyfriend!'' and she stared at my junk while we talked. Back then I believed she was just joking or being weird, maybe both. "
He would take the lid and straw off the fast food cup and drink it like a glass.  
One of life's biggest irony is that it's only by getting laid a lot that you end up realizing it's not that important.
"""Dude, you come off creepy as fuck.""

Then suggest what he could do better.

Don't mince words or try to beat around the bush."
"My SO is beautiful with and without makeup. She wears makeup because she enjoys putting it on and she likes doing cool things with it and I think it's awesome. In that sense, I love her with makeup because she's happy wearing it and I like seeing her happy. But also I like her without makeup as well because she is beautiful."
"Because when we were on a date I was doing EVERYTHING. At first it was okay, when you meet somebody who's pretty good looking and funny and intelligent it takes a while to realize. And then one day it hit me like a brick through the window:

I picked where we met, when we met, I picked the bar we went to and every single decision was just met with a blank stare. Even a simple thing would be this purgatory of guesswork where I'd either have to guess what would be a hit or we'd go through this awful thing say at a bar like: ""Maybe you'd like an IPA?""  
""eww I hate beer it's gross!""  
""Fine how about a cocktail?""  
""I'm trying to cut down on sugar."" 

The thing that did it was we were at dinner when the waiter came to take the order I realized I was expected to order for both of us without even having a discussion like this was the 1950s. I knew I couldn't do this, I want a partner not a passenger. "
Made too many typos when sexting
"She was gaining weight while I was losing it. I got more looks from other, more attractive women.

I wanted to fuck those women. So I broke up with the girlfriend to do so. 

No ragrets. "
It was a speed bump
I learned how insecure I was. I had no redeeming qualities as a partner. But the next couple of years were great as I focused on myself. I did a lot of growing and learning about just who I am. Really made me appreciate myself more and not completely look for happiness in someone else.
I'm working my way up to average
"Her style of texting was really annoying to me and I couldn't handle it. She would use ellipses as if they were fancy periods and would end everything which could possibly be construed as a question with a question mark. Her use of emojis was also out of hand. Part of me wonders if I'm really that much of a dick that I would give up on an attractive girl who was interested in me for something so stupid, but I don't really regret it. Reading her texts would always piss me off. "
Pretended to be someone else and ordered a stripper to my home and acted all surprised and shocked when she arrived. Best birthday ever....
Your step mom is a piece of shit
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket
She got out of breath walking up a small hill.
"Yeah, my birthday was 2 days ago I was hoping for anything from anyone. My husband didn't even get me card. I don't want  or expect anything but fuck I would have been thrilled with Happy Birthday written on a napkin. fuck.. 

Edit:   I just realised this was askmen, oh well. To be clear I am a woman."
"Spoke really fucking whimsically, like super relaxed and floaty way of speaking. At first it was endearing then it was just odd "
"A lot of guys mention the importance of fitness, so if the are any women reading this who don't fully understand, I just wanted to make something explicit, from my point of view:

Fat women, chubby women, and so on, can be beautiful and pretty and so on, but there are certain approaches to how you dress and carry yourself that really only work if you're on the thinner side, and if larger women try to do it, it's incredibly unflattering to them. So if you're a larger woman trying to look good, be aware that not everything that works for thin women will work for you. That doesn't mean you're not sexy, it just means you need a different strategy sometimes"
Defo. A dude with a vag is not interesting to me. I'd go as far as to say I'd be more interested in a feminine body with a penis attached than the reverse
"I think it's nice to look at, then I move on with my life. "
I've never been brought on a date by a girl.
Have an upvote for a truly petty answer
"She would never type the correct Your or Your're. And when I brought it up one day telling her bad grammar irritates me, she started using ""ur"" instead of either one.

Broke up with her that same week."
"That there's more than 2 genders.

Look, bang who you wanna bang, wear what you wanna wear, have your hair how you want your hair, wear makeup or don't, feel how you wanna feel, IDGAF as long as it doesn't involve me. But I just don't understand how that makes more than 2 genders. If you're a guy who dresses really feminine and is bisexual, great, whatever makes you happy, but that doesn't make you're not a guy...


Edit: Grammar"
"Boundaries. I know what I definitely can and can't handle, and behavior I will or won't accept in a partner."
"I had a girl over to my dorm one night, basically a friend of mine so I thought nothing of it. Got shit faced. ""Do you mind if I just sleep here?"" Nah I don't give a shit. ""Can you give me a back rub?"" Oh yeah sure, I'm the back fucking master. 

Decent night sleep for a tiny college bed. "
"Most of life is figuring out that no-ones got their shit completely sorted out mate - we're all in the process at some point or another. We just get a lot better at giving the impression of having a handle on things, on sorting out the obvious issues, and cleaning up the rest. Learn to live with the knowledge that you could always be doing more, always be trying harder and draw inspiration from that - but never mistake stability for anything other than temporary stagnation. 

As to how to get there: planning. Amazing how easy it is to know you're not where you want to be in life but how hard it is to know where you wish you were. Be honest with yourself about what you want, be detailed. Figure out the chap you'd like to be in 5 years. Break it down into categories - relationship, job, education, whatever applies. Then figure out how the bloke you are today ends up as that chap. Improving your life takes effort mate, a lot of work. Always remember tho - that effort needs to be directed in the right ways, towards productive outcomes. "
Every single gun is loaded and has the safety off.
"I'm not grossed out by dicks, and I don't think vaginas look that great, really. I mean, have you ever seen a vagina by itself? Not for me. 

But dude, hello? Boobs?"
"&gt; I want a partner not a passenger

Beautifully put. I've had dates like that-- where it feels like you're unexpectedly putting on a one-man show for an audience of one, yet you're still paying the admission fee."
"Well I only saw her a handful of times.

She kept a fruit bowl but didn't use the fruit in it.  She let them rot and threw them out.  Fake fruit were not something I could convince her to get.  She actually got upset at me for eating an apple out of the bowl.  Because she'd have to replace the fruit sooner.

I don't even know man...

Also, fruit flies and vinegar traps everywhere.  Damn it come on."
"exactly.

I am even curious and would gladly suck a dick, if it didn't have a man attached to it. I can't imagine myself with another man, and if I do, I am put off."
"I knew I shouldn't have clicked this fucking thread. Fuck man memories are currently flooding back of multiple girls saying things like 'you know everyone thinks we're doing it' and other shit like that. 

Fact is even now I'm an adult and a girl could say that to me and I'd still freeze thinking 'is she flirting or saying we need to spend less time together' "
Shouldn't you be doing things for yourself instead? Sorry to hear about your situation though OP :(
"Upvoted for actually being petty.

I say ""you're welcome"" to the self-checkout machines all the time so they're my friends when the machines takeover. "
It's better to laugh about the stupid things you've done than to regret the things you didn't.
He was an unapologetic interrupter.
"And only date girls whose birthday is in January, for the trifecta. "
"Tell him the things you want to do, realistically, and then work with him to accomplish those.

Trust me, he will be far more fulfilled by helping you do awesome things together than otherwise.

If you truly have only three years or so to spend with him then he will be much, much happier in the long run knowing he was able to help you.

Relish every moment."
"How do you teach a starving man that food is not everything?

How do you teach poverty stricken man that money is not everything?

Why is sex any different?

When you have a chronically unfulfilled need, it consumes your every waking thought.  

I think you have it backwards. There being a need is not the problem. Society does an excruciatingly poor job of teaching young men how to satisfy their sexual needs. If those who need sex didn't have a problem getting it, they wouldn't resort to destructive means to get it."
"Now that I'm a little more mature, absolutely nothing...but they said most petty, so there ya go."
"I'll be 25 next month, I have my own place and a nice truck payment but I also work construction, getting divorced, drink heavily most nights and genuinely hate life, so depends what you consider ""getting shit together"""
I'm 70 and my wife has her shit together enough for both of us. Thank God.
"Your question shows only half the picture. Casual gaming is dominated by women these days. All these games that run on your tablet or smart phone, or browser games are mostly played by women.

Console and PC gaming, where people invest hundreds of hours are more of a male domain. I think this has a lot to do with the content produced. I feel that games on consoles are specifically designed for a male audience. I'm having a hard time to find a game on Xbox that isn't built around a mechanic of *kill this thing* (and I am totally okay with that). I suspect that it tends to a secret power fantasy men have.

As for the women who call gaming childish, most of them watch TV for hours or invest their time in some other fashion. What makes that so much better?"
"Since moving to this town I'm now in, i basically do everything by myself. I go hiking in the state park alone, eat at restaurants alone, watch movies at the theater alone, and drink alone. I actually took myself to see Dr. Strange tonight. I have no friends here and I'm absolutely miserable, especially since the guy I was dating dumped me a month ago. It's been fucking rough. "
"After 3 kids my wife was particularity concerned with stretched saggy skin. I told her that I was enamored with her body. Her new body was from carrying my children and there is no more loving or intimate gift anyone could ever do for me than that, and because of that how could I ever consider them a negative thing - it could only ever be positive for me. "

"No advice, just wanted to say it's cute that this is a team effort haha"
"When sex isn't an issue, it's nothing. When sex IS an issue, it feels like it's everything."
Her text messages read like telegraphs. 
"I was dating the woman who would eventually become my wife, so this does have a happy ending.

We were watching moves at my place before netflix and chill was a thing.  We hadn't slept together yet.  It started to snow, a real squall.  It got really bad really fast.  I said ""It's pretty bad out there, you can stay here if you'd like""

She blushes and says ""I'd like that""

""okay great!  I'll take the couch so you can have the bed""

It took a long time for me to figure out why she got so distant that night.  It seemed to be going so well!"
"Jealousy has never kept a cheater from cheating. It has however pushed faithful partners away and ended good relationships because being distrusted and policed is monumentally stifling and insulting.

So choose whichever option sounds better to you."
I signed up for some interwebsite where I talk to interweb strangers all day. And by talk I mean mostly read. 
Damn. :(
"Tell a guy they're interested in him and ask him out on a date, at least based on what I see women on here asking about."
WYD STOP.  I'm bored STOP  I'm going to get something to eat STOP

"she kept her medium-sized dog in a cage all it's life, took it out for a walk every few days. It was so sad."
"Break up before Christmas, get back together after Valentines day. It's the perfect strategy. "
"Honestly, I don't blame you."
"I feel that. My step mom would always say ""I never got treated special on my birthday, so why should you? Welcome to the real world"" on my birthdays after I turned 14 or so, and she'd always find stupid random shit for me to do around the house. She's just sit and play her DS or something and criticize me after. I started disappearing for the whole day too, just wandering around town waiting until she went to bed. "
God damn reddit is a sad place. If you can use a computer your life doesn't have to be average.

"Offer to hang out with him regularly to help take his mind off things. 

Be patient with him. I'm sorry your sister did such a thing, and I ask you to inspire him so that he doesn't lose hope on life. Be a friend, be his hero, be his go-to-for support. 

If I were you personally I'd stick around long enough to make sure he ends up with someone who will treat him better, and make sure he's emotionally safe.

Hope that helps. :)"
Time by Pink Floyd
"A girl in high school begged me to follow her Xanga, and when I explained that I didn't have one, she went out of her way to make me an account. She wrote my first post, which I believe simply said ""Rebekah is the cutest!"" and the password was ""Rebekahisawesome."" Totally went over my head."
"Accept that your emotions don't control your actions. Influence yes, control no. Believe it. 

Learn to ""ride"" your emotions. Feel it, don't suppress it, don't expect it to go away. Experience it and accept it for what it is. Focus on the feeling (not your perceived cause for the feeling) for a bit. It helps. I find the surfing analogy useful - ride the wave of the emotion.

Own and take responsibility for your emotions. Your emotions do not control you. Nobody can ""make you"" feel a certain way. You often feel that way in response to something, sure, but that's internally generated and you have some choice about it. How you respond is your choice.

Edit: I'd also like to emphasise an important point others have made, which is to manage your expectations. If you paint someone else as who you want them to be you're setting yourself up for a fall. Try to look past your wishes and expectations at who they are. It's easy to expect that because you want something, they do too, but there's no reason that should be the case and again, it's setting yourself up for disappointment."
"Can confirm. 

Met a girl at a party at my house. We talked for like two hours, she was standing so close to me I'm pretty sure I was holding most of her weight the whole night. Then she asks if she can stay over, I say sure, there's lots of room.  At one point (she told me this later) she stood up on her tip toes after holding eye contact thinking I would give her a kiss and I just offered her a bite of my pizza. 

She waits and hangs out with me till the party completely dies down and all of the couches and spare rooms are taken. I offer to let her sleep in my room, with me crashing on a foam mattress in the living room.  I walk her up to my room to grab my cellphone charger and a blanket, she tells me to sit down for a bit and we can talk. I sit down and we talk a bit, she says I should just lie down and we should sleep, I say ok. 

She grabs my arm, snuggles up against me, face a half inch from mine and I...fall asleep. 

Woke up five minutes later to her kissing me AND then I finally got a clue. I was just so drunk that I didn't even think about sex. Luckily she was forward enough to not let me completely blow it. 

"
"See that's the thing that gets me too. 

Like the whole yawn and stretch. Unf. 

Sorrynotsorry"
"Don't take it.  Generally I don't like this practice.  Half the girls I know do it intentionally in the hopes of getting free drinks, and guys are petulant about the practice when it goes the way you describe.

Just don't be a part of it unless you want to maybe make a new friend."
She owed me $120 and wanted to pay me back by giving me haircuts. 
"Built a snowman.

My childhood friend and I had a secret tradition every new year's eve. We'd go at the evening or at night while everyone is partying in boring grownup way, into a wide field in the neighborhood woods, and build a snowman.

That year she wouldn't be around anymore but I wanted to keep our tradition so I did it alone and crying while thinking about her."
I'll be one of the few to go against the grain here --- I have in past been shocked at how different a woman i was dating looked without makeup. The difference is huge. Even though she didn't look like she was wearing substantial makeup prior to seeing her without it.
"One guy I talked to said, with an arrogant tone, ""Just because there is a goalie doesn't mean you can't score."" 

He was talking about hitting on one girl he had eyes on, but I then pointed out that she is my girlfriend. He then said the aforementioned statement. I had rarely felt such a strong urge to punch someone in the face in public."
"Personally, no. I'm from Texas. Most women where I live range from pudgy to fat. It might be one thing if she had abs, but most women here that try baring midriff shouldn't. Muffintops aren't attractive. Busted cans of biscuits."
"Why are these things actually a thing?

I didn't give a rats arse about Womens day, Hotdog day, Hamburger day, or Men's day. 

"
"If you feel like you are having a heart attack and decide to take aspirin, you **must** chew the aspirin for it to be effective."
"Don't, be a mess for awhile, when my dog died I cried for 5 days straight, before that I probably hadn't cried for 8-10 years. 

Grieve, tell funny stories about her with family and friends, have a few drinks but don't over do it, cry if you need to, I found it easier to go off by myself and cry.  

Eventually the pain will fade, you'll just feel a little empty, but you can lean on those happy memories when it gets hard. Remember her in your own way, it really helps."
That ain't petty 
"Not petty at all, that's really sad "
Not for me. Any pleasure I'd get from having my dick sucked would immediately be cancelled out by the fact that there was a dick in my mouth.
Because it was funny from June -December of 1994.
Personally I'm not even disgusted by the thought of being intimate with another man it just isn't desirable or stimulating in any way. 
"I went on a date with a girl I met on OKCupid. She worked at the [George Peabody Library](https://www.google.com/search?q=george+peabody+library&amp;biw=1323&amp;bih=849&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW1bW9_6rQAhUB_mMKHV20DCkQ_AUIBygA&amp;dpr=1) in Baltimore and wanted to bring me on a date while it was closed one day. [It looks like this on a normal day](http://imgur.com/gallery/WbMXe).

Anyways, she took me [to the top of the library](http://imgur.com/a/LDAcU) (probably our 3rd date). Nobody was there. We were surrounded by dusty book shelves that haven't been touched or cleaned in years, and then took me to a back room that had original copies of books like this [original version of Winnie the Poo](http://imgur.com/a/LDAcU), and we talked about our favorite authors, books and poets. We literally just sat on the 5th floor together, doing the whole ""leg-touch flirting"" thing, but never made it past a kiss (I'm an idiot). We had a great conversation for a solid 2 hours.

Probably the most fun and memorable dates I've ever been on. I felt like a kid again "
&gt;Your're
"&gt; And at first he said he won't stop. 

Dafuq? Why are you still friends with this asshole?"
"No one cares. I don't mean that if you have an accident or something similar, that your friends won't support you, but everyday stuff. No one cares about that spot on your shirt, because they're too concerned about the spot on theirs. Everyone is concerned about how they look/feel/present, so don't sweat the little stuff."
"Drove around by myself in busy parts of town, often in the evenings, so I could feel like I was amongst people or ""out."""
Her vagina smelled really really bad and I just couldn't get it out of my head
"Exhausting. At least when it's a true state of self-hate.

It's like your love for them bounces off like rubber. No matter how good you are to them and show your love, they won't stop thinking and acting in ways that are ultimately negative for most relationships.

For me personally, these kinds of relationships never lasted long. I'm supportive, but I can't be a doormat to issues that never are attempted to be resolved."
Yeah for real. She's not letting classic dude obliviousness get in the way of getting laid. 
"Thank you for saying that in a way that isn't insanely rude. I feel like people have a difficult time expressing this and it always comes out like ""Overweight people should basically wear potato sacks and stay inside."""
"This is beautiful. Nerd moment, if you haven't already, make sure these are on digital media and backed up. If they are on some kind of tape they will be approaching their shelf life soon. "
"okay that last part, I don't know how you blew that."
I hated her haircut. 
"According to my friends (who are college freshmen or high school seniors so different age ranges, take this with a grain of salt), they want a round butt, big boobs, white, preferably long blonde hair, nice hips yet small stomach. Preferably in shape with a cute face and luscious lips. 

---

Don't get me wrong: if a girl like that was interested in me, I wouldn't shoot her down. But I find myself crushing hardcore on the opposite: short, petite, no ass/boobs, short hair. I'm ridiculously attracted to the androgynous look and a LOT of my friends give me shit for it (like any good friend should)"

There are 3 sets and can be broken up as conversation pieces over the course of three dates when spaced with smaller more casual questions.  Technically at the end of all three sets, you're supposed to spend 60 seconds looking into each others eyes in silence, but I usually skip that part."
"How absolutely important having aligned dreams and  direction are.

When me and my last ex broke up, we both still loved each other but we knew we'd grown too far apart to keep it going.  "
Her laugh was really *really* annoying. 
"Not me but in high school I had a friend who was obsessed with a new guy at school. She was so obsessed that she was borderline suicidal because she thought she'd never have a chance. 

One day, in PE, he put his sweats on backwards and she was disgusted. Crush OVER. "
"2 big ones.

First relationship: I was way too jealous and controlling, and learned that this behavior is toxic and will only create distrust and resentment.

Second relationship: I was all-in, doing everything I could to make her happy, while not getting the same effort in return. In the end, I realized I needed someone to love me the way I love her."
"The ""no make up make up"" look uses an unbelievable amount of make up!"
"Two car related ones: 

1. Knowing how to break tempered automotive glass (don't waste your energy kicking or hitting it, find an object that will allow you apply a lot of pressure in a small area to break it) 
2. If you ever crash your car into a body of water, however shallow it might seem, you should immediately start rolling your windows down (once the vehicle is fully submerged the pressure of the water against the door will make it impossible to open the door). You can either escape through the open window or wait for the pressure to equalize and open the door."
Started singing American national anthem while reading this and I'm not even from USA.
"2 bowls of oatmeal, 1 bag of salad, 1 salmon fillet, 1 container of rice, 1 protein bar. Currently 400 calories under my target for the day(which is 500-600 calories under my TDEE) Currently down 20 lbs with 30 more to go."
"I don't know, she didn't have to give an attitude. Reverse the genders, and have the guy getting pissed for not getting laid, he'd be an asshole. 

You could've communicated your anxieties better. But you're young and inexperienced. Don't beat yourself up. Sucks to miss out on a hottie, but what can you do. Shit happens. "
"Wow thats really messed up. :(. Really sorry about that, and hey, just cause its askmen, at the end of the day we all have the same struggles no matter the gender. *hug*. Hope things improve for you soon."
"Men: We're pregnant!

Women: We're growing a beard!

u wot m8? 😂"
"I got to my early-mid teens when I realized that my life would probably only be about average. I wouldn't get to do awesome crazy stuff, nor would I get a lot of the things I wanted or get them at an early age.

I'd probably have my first awkward clumsy kiss around the age of 15, maybe a first girlfriend at around 16. Possibly lose my virginity after prom. Have a first proper relationship in college in my late teens. Maybe have a few okay and a few bad relationships through my 20s. Meet someone in my 30s that was good enough for me to marry and pop out a few kids with. Get old never having had an amazing career but good enough to support a small family with the odd vacation here and there.

Instead here I am at 28 never had a girlfriend, never kissed, still a virgin. Only managed to get my first ever job recently at the age of 26, and I'm now working minimum wage at a supermarket while still living with my dad. I am fighting as hard as I can just to get up to that point of 'average' that I thought was so inevitable, but it turns out that not everyone has those 'average' experiences just fall into their lap."
Nice try Buzzfeed.
"**TL:DR** Jeep accident in the middle of nowhere.  [Pictures here](http://imgur.com/gallery/mu1ct)

Had a dream job as a seasonal employee at a National Park.  Went out on a jeep trail with a buddy.  We leave the park and I came to a fork in the road . I chose the more difficult one ""because I can handle it"" I tell my good buddy in the passenger seat.  After several miles of an absolutely boulder filled, difficult, crazy trail, (I mean liteally one of the craziest roads I've every traversed in 10 years of owning and using a jeep)), we cross a stream, and go up a hill, right on the edge of a cliff.  The roads is suddenly smooth, there are no more boulders and dropoffs to navigate, so of course I say, ""looks like we're in the clear!""  

Then suddenly, the jeep starts to tilt, my buddy starts screaming ""Oh god, oh god.""  I look at him as we are leaning, all I can see is a cloud of dust through his open doorway, and then, we are gone.  The road has collapsed along the cliff edge. We roll about 35 feet down the cliff, it is a full barrel roll.  It seemed to happen in slow motion, I'm staring straight ahead, gripping the steering wheel, just waiting this out, listening to the loud **CLANGS** as the sides and roof roll and hit the cliff, and then we're freefalling and **BAM!!!** The windshield spiderwebs, the passenger side wheel pops, and I'm blinded for a second by the most intense glare in my life.

I'm wide awake, the glare gradually fading away, and it feels like I had just been gut punched harder than anyone in history, and I am just sucking in the wind that was knocked out of me for like two minutes.  Once that's over, I know I'm hurt bad in my back.  I had suffered a slipped disc weightlifting years before and figured I just aggravated it worse than it had ever been.  I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt and lay my seat back as far as it will go in a desperate attempt to get flat, and just want to wait for the pain to go away all while thinking, ""This is actually happening, I'm so fucked, I'm so fucked"". My buddy is hurt worse, he's slumped over and bleeding on my shorts.  

Now I'm incredibly worried, but I'm also in so much pain he's not my priority, but he started to moan in pain and I was so relieved.  He comes too, he's in a ton of pain and begs me to lay his chair back.   In fact, he starts to freak out, because he can't feel his legs, he can barely move.  

Mentally I'm freaking out, I don't want to even think about the P-word.  I tell my buddy to stay calm and not to move.  I struggle to get out of my jeep, the pain is crippling.  I make my way over to the passenger side, manage to pull out the back seat of my jeep that had popped out and lean my buddy's seat back.  I collapse from the pain on the bank of the stream, and lie there for a few minutes until the red ants start to swarm me and I force myself to get up.  I get back in the jeep, but not before filling an empty nalgene bottle with dirty stream water, it tastes like we were in a cow pasture (fun fact, we were).

Anyway, I'm lying down and thinking about how fucked this is.  I'm telling my buddy, ""This is **SO** fucked.""  We are miles from civilization on a pretty obscure, unmaintained jeep road, and there's no phone service.  Because we're not total idiots me and my buddy had shared our general plan with his girlfriend (who also worked at the park) that if were not back by 10 p.m, were in trouble.  Well, this accident happened around 6:15 p.m.  I'm in a ton of pain and thinking, ""I'll wait an hour, then get help, I want to rest.""

Meanwhile my buddy (who ironically enough completed Search and Rescue training that day) starts asking if his chair can be leaned back anymore.  I tell him no and he goes ""ok, ok, no worries man"" but in 30 seconds he asks again if I can lean his chair back more.  Red flags go off in my head, I'm thinking concussion.  I spend the next 30 minutes telling him over and over again his chair can't be leaned back anymore.  Eventually he starts asking what happened.  ""We rolled off a cliff,"" I tell him.  ""We rolled off a cliff?"" he asks.  ""Yes about 25, 30 feet"" I say.  ""Well, how about we drive out of there?"" is his next question. ""The jeep is fucked,"" I say.  ""Does anyone knows where we are?"" is the third question. ""Yes, your girlfriend back in Fruita."" I tell him.  ""I have a girlfriend?"" is his reply.  I tell him she'll know something is up at 10 p.m.  After I answer these questions for him, he contemplates the situation, and asks again ""What happened?""

So yeah, I'm like 100% sure he has a concussion.  I answer his questions again.  And again.  I decide I can't get help now, between the inability to move and head injury, my buddy can't be left alone.  I also think we'll be rescued later that night, so I tell him we just have to wait until 9 for his girlfriend to freak out and tell the Law Enforcement rangers, and then a few more hours until they find us.  I tell him we just have to wait, and then he's going to enjoy the best helicopter ride and have an amazing hospital room.  He asks again what happened, and I we go through his question cycle for a few hours more, only being interrupted by him occasionally freaking out that he can't feel his legs.

During this time I find an emergency kit I keep in my car, filled with two emergency blankets, glow sticks, hand warmers (that don't work), a dead flashlight, and a whistle.  Even though it's still warm, we're in high desert terrain, and I know it will be in the 40s that night.  The jeep doesn't have doors or windows (though the soft top is up) and we're both wearing t-shirts, shorts and flip flops.  I try my best to wrap him in the blanket, and also give him a wool cap and gloves I have in a duffel bag I keep in my car.  I wrap myself up too as the darkness gradual falls.

In the distance we begin to hear a lot of loud Moo's.  My buddy starts freaking out.  The public land were in is open pasture for cattle, and we are spooking a nearby herd.  I can't see that well through the spider-webbed windshield and the sunset, but apparently they are nearby.  My buddy thinks we are going to be attacked, but I tell him we'll be fine.  Truthfully, I am worried, since spooked cows might act defensive if they feel threatened, we both really can't move, and how embarrassing would that be to survive a fall off a cliff to get killed by fucking scared cows?  I honk the horn of the jeep, and I never see any cows as it becomes dark, but we do hear them for a couple hours more.

So yeah, basically the evening consisted of my answering the same exact questions from my buddy, who has no idea he's even a park guide, let alone out in a western national park.  I'm in pain and just telling myself only a few hours more, a couple hours more, an hour more, and now people should know that something's up.  Even though 10 P.M. was our ""get nervous"" time for his girlfriend, I was confident she'd be freaking out by 9 P.M and we'd be rescued soon.

Around 10 I am listening for anything.  I start honking the horn.  Anytime I hear a plane or helicopter I flash the brights on my jeep.  I keep trying to call 911 because even with no service there can be a small chance it'll connect to a tower in emergency situations.  It starts to get cold.  My buddy says his feet are freezing, he keeps pulling up the emergency blanket and I can't fix it, because when I lean over the pain is so intense I want to throw up, but a few times I feel sympathy and decide to suffer through getting the blanket properly wrapped around my injured buddy.  I also pull out a big map of the park and surrounding areas, and try to put it over his feet, as well as my empty duffel bag.  It's cold, but I know it's not cold enough for us to freeze to death or suffer frostbit, but every little bit will make us slightly more comfortable.

Through the night, I gradually lose patience, between answering the same questions over and over and over and over and over and over again, and because my buddy keeps messing up his blanket, and it is so, so painful to try and fix.  He constantly is trying to adjust his body on his seat, we both wish we could be lying completely flat but our seats only lay back so far; he screams in pain, and then freaks out because he realizes out he can't feel his legs.  He keep forgetting this fact all night, and it is a shitshow every 20 minutes.  I observe him, he can move his legs and feet to an extent, so I'm feeling more positive he's not paralyzed, but I know it's still a huge deal and he should be staying steal.  I stick an arm under his blanket, and demand he grab it with his hands, to keep us a little more warm and to keep him still.  We lie back, in the cold night, him tightly clutching my arm as I press down on his chest in a desperate attempt to stay warm and keep him still.

Around 1 am, I come to conclusion that rescue will not be happening tonight.   I still flash my brights every time I think there's a plane or helicopter flying overhead, but I figure it's meaningless. I'm freezing cold, in a ton of pain, and am at my whits end answering the same questions over and over and over again.  Actually, I begin to snap at him, ""I've answered this question at least 200 fucking times, and you're going to forget it in 5 minutes.""  He's taken aback. ""Sorry buddy, sorry buddy,"" he meekly replies, before I apologize and tell him he won't remember this conversation in 5 minutes anyway.  And so it go's for another few hours. At least it's a new conversation to add to the cycle.  I'm annoyed that we're not going to rescued soon. I tell my buddy to think of warm hospital beds and how great that helicopter ride is going to be.  I keep honking the horn at this point to keep us awake.

*Part Two continued below*"
She is going to make a move on you. She wants sex.
"The vagina is like a BigMac; its a mess.  Visually its a confusing disaster of a body part, but there's nothing physical most men crave more in the world.

Like a BigMac, vaginas appeal to our other senses more than our vision.  We know a BigMac tastes delicious, hence why we gobble it down despite it looking like old slop between two buns.  The Vagina is the same, we know it provides the best feeling in the world, aside from love.  So we forgive the visual presentation and even convince ourselves they look beautiful due to its worth to our other senses.

Penises are not necessarily disgusting to most men, after all we all watch porn, but they do nothing for us, and we generally don't want other men looking at our penises, so we naturally look away from other mens'.  

And that my friends is my completely non-scientific opinion and I stand behind it."
You do understand the purpose of a condom right?
"High School Edition: A new girl who sat next to me in class asked me if I could walk with her to show her where the next class was (it was a big school). I spent a week basically walking in front of her, leading her to the class instead of, you know, talking with her like she probably wanted. That was either a missed signal or a missed opportunity. Probably a little of both.

College Edition: Cute girl appears in the cafeteria and sits across from me. The room was almost empty because the hours were odd. She just starts chatting like we're friends. Asks me about myself. I think, *""where's the hidden camera?""* The next evening, she was at the same spot, apparently waiting for me. Conversation goes nowhere because I'm still in shock. Never saw her again.

Post-College Edition: Met a girl online. Had coffee together. About an hour in she mentions she lived a few blocks away. We go to her place and her roommate is there. No worries, date grabs a bottle of wine and gestures up the stairs. We sat on her bed drinking for another hour. My mind raced- *""what the fuck is happening? It shouldn't be this easy. I didn't even tell her my good jokes. I'm only average-looking. I don't even remember her last name. Did she even tell me her last name?""*

Sure as shit, nothing happened. The next day she emails me and says the spark she felt is gone.

Yeah, it was less about their signals and more that I used to be dense."
"* A calm, composed resolve in the most harrowing of situations.

* An unmeasured degree of sincerity and respect, and humility when interacting with others or addressing them.

* Shows a passion for his interests, and is dedicated to them. 

* Isn't afraid to make mistakes- rather, he takes them as a gracious learning curve and humbly accepts victory/defeat.

* Charm. A great deal of it.

"Western society's ideal woman is a white blonde woman. In most non-Western societies, it is someone with a lighter skin.

Absolutely how I feel. She's an absolute smokeshow with make up on and an absolute cutie patootie when she comes home from the gym with her hair up in that messy bun she wears. 
"Feelings and maturity.

I've had girls tell me they've dumped guys because they started to get too ""emotional"" and would cry about some pretty deep shit. That's not cool. I hate that perception that dudes can't cry and shit. 

Maturity as in that apparently now that I'm 23 years old it means I shouldn't be playing video games, love LOTR, or watching anime, but doing stuff like ""adventuring, hiking, etc.""

I may be grown now with a job, etc., but in my eyes it's like I have the money to afford the things I never could as a kid. It's my chance to have the fun I wanted. I still go out, work out at the gym, and so-on so fuck anyone who judges how I spend my extra free time."

Grabbed my foreskin (I'm uncut) and pulled it over her nose so she looked like Pinocchio.
Sounds like you're just being spontaneous.
"She got way too drunk on our lunch date at the bar.

We go back to her place and she smokes weed for the first time ever. She gets super twisted.

Despite me being 100% explicit about only wanting something casual, no omission just upfront she now decides to start crying and telling me she really wants a boyfriend.

She takes on a 3rd person demon voice. ""Fuck her. She wants you to fuck her just fuck her"" no joke throaty like a movie

I ask where the water is, grab my shit and sneak out. She texts me angrily 20 min later and then adds me on snapchat 3 months later."
"A girl I was seeing left halfway through the movie because there was an Asian stereotype joke. This wasn't some kind of ""kill all Asians"" kind of joke. It was a really innocent joke that she said was ""oppressing minorities"". "

"Learn how to network. No not computer networking, though that's useful, but learn how to make contacts in the industry you're working in or want to work in. To do this you're going to need to be an outgoing friendly person and know how to talk to strangers. You also need to know where to go to get these opportunities. Bars and breweries tend to be phenomenal places in my experience. It helps to wear gear from your college or gear from a local sports team or something where someone might initiate a conversation with you. You also need to be able to notice that in other people and make connections.

For instance I live in the Philly area and went to a bar on Friday after work. I saw a guy sitting at the bar with two people, but he seemed busy on his phone. I sat next to him because he was wearing a Dallas Cowboys hat, my favorite team, and a rival of the local team. I made a quick comment offhanded to him and he put his phone down and we talked for 45 minutes, I met his future fiance, and his friend. We talked for a little about sports, then it moved to work and life. I walked away with his card and a job offer.

It's super important to learn how to network anywhere you are."

I like seeing muscle and mirin it."

"My wife drove a Smartcar in the rural deep south.

I kept telling her we needed to buy a Fleshlight, cut the rubber koochie business end off and glue it to the back bumper as a Truck Nutz[tm] parody.

She wouldn't let me.  Bummer."
"If we're not banging, she can sleep on the couch."
"Around 3 A.M we are both exhausted, but I can not let my potentially concussed buddy fall asleep.  He begins to ramble, about things like how his awesome sister makes the best red gummy bears and how his friends back home are like lizard skyscrapers.  I ask him questions and receive nonsense in return.  I am so, so, *SO* relieved he is done asking the same questions over and over again.  When we both start nod off I honk the horn and flash the brights.  He gets startled and angry every time I do this ""Why are you doing that?!"" He groans.  I tell him it's so people find us, but I know there's no one out there.  I tell him he can't sleep.  He begs for sleep.  This carries on for more than a couple of hours.

Around 4:30 A.M it gradually begins to get lighter.  I am so fucking relieved.  At 5 the sky is starting to get clear.  It's not until 6:30 A.M that the sun is officially rising, but it's still just freezing cold.  I make up my mind that I need to get help as soon as I can.  While my buddy cannot look after himself, rescue is many hours off, and I want to make it happen sooner, rather than later.  Also, I cannot stand to hear my buddy ask ""What happened?"" ""Does anyone know where we are?"" and ""I have a girlfriend?"" one more time. Any Search and Rescue party would only know what dirt road we took out of the national park, and we were now well outside the park on some god forsaken rough road.  I figure if I walk back towards the park any involved in the search for us will be coming from the park road.

At 7:30, it's finally warm enough to move.  I prepare for a ton of pain and slide out of the jeep.  It is surprisingly not awful, I keep my back straight and it's really not that bad.  If I bend over though, it is the most pain I've ever experienced in my life.  I make a note to keep proper posture. It's a long hike back to the park, so first I pull the back seat of my jeep well away from the jeep, dump a can of white fuel I had in my trunk all over it, and light it up.  It generates an nice plume of black smoke, but I instantly realize we're so far out in rugged, remote country there's no way anyone can see it

I pull my buddy's backpack out, it had been wedged back behind his seat and I hadn't been able to pull it out despite many efforts the night before.  I open it up, and of course there's a jacket, food, and a nalgene full of clear, pure water.  My buddy had been so out of it he didn't even know he had a backpack full of goodies, I thought this revelation hilarious in a weird way.  It would have made for a warmer night for my buddy and we wouldn't have had to drink so much downstream-from-a-pasture creek water.  I dump out everything, and load the backpack up with my map of the area, some trail mix, and a nalgene of creek water. I leave the nice water for my buddy.  He's actually becoming more coherent.  I tell him I'm getting help and tell him he needs to stay still.  He has me prop his feet up on the dash and I head out.

Now, when the jeep had rolled off the cliff, we landed only about 10 feet from the road, so it was pretty straightforward.  I got hiking around 8 A.M. It wasn't actually so bad.  Yes I hurt, but I mean, what else could I do?  I hike for hours.  Around 12:30 P.M I was nearly back to the park boundaries.  I start hiking up this hill on the road into the park, when down comes the white pickup of a Law Enforcement ranger.

Seeing that pickup was the best feeling of my life.  I was exhausted, turns out I hiked about 7.5 miles through tough terrain (lots of hills, uneven roads, and rocks.). I just threw up an arm and exhaustively waved them down.

The driver in the jeep was a Law Enforcement officer I really respected, a badass mid-30's women who just gave off this air of confidence and competency.  Her passenger was the younger 30's head horticulturist, who like 90% of all Park Service employees was Search and Rescue trained.  She had a reputation as icy cold and serious.  I wouldn't have wanted to be rescued by anyone else.

""Oh there you are"" says the driver, almost cheerily, ""we figured you had a little breakdown in your jeep!""

""We fell down a cliff, [my buddy] is seriously hurt.  He needs help right away.  I can lead you there"" I reply.

Immediately the two rescuers get serious.  They get on the radio and ask for two air ambulances.  I tell them I don't need a helicopter.  They ignore me.  The horticulturalist gets out and gets me a Gatorade.  I get in the truck.  It's the best drink I've ever had in my life.  We get driving down the rough road.  It's extremely painful, every jolt is pain, every dip is agony.  It's far worse than the long hike out.  I explain what happened, the Law Enforcement ranger drives and tells the horticulturalist what to say back to dispatch.  It takes us an hour to drive, and once we pass the branch where my buddy the road gets serious.  We rip off the front bumper going over boulders.  The rangers tell me that they never would have taken this road to look for us, that it's way too rough.

A mile and a half a way, we are forced to stop and continue on foot.  We reach the accident.  It's around 2 P.M. My buddy has somehow pulled himself out of the jeep, and is now lying on a sandbar with his feet in the stream, *on the drivers side!*. I am shocked.  Our rescuers talk to my buddy.  They ask him what happened.  He tells them ""oh, we got in an accident today, [baconrising] went to get help!  I decided to explore!""  He's pretty cheerful for a guy who can't move.  Apparently he had decided to leave the jeep, promptly collapsed, and dragged himself to the driver's side.  The rangers give my buddy oxygen, and they grab a leftover emergency blanket and set it up so I can lay down in the shade of a bush.  I can finally sleep, there's not much left for me at this point.

I nap sporadically, the first helicopter arrives.  The paramedics are in shock that we survived the accident when they see the state of my jeep and the size of the cliff we fell down.  They have to stabilize my buddy because his pulse is too low to fly out right away, but eventually they get going.  I beg the Law Enforcement Officer to drive me out, since I really don't want to pay for an expensive helicopter ride.  She tells me the helicopter is already on the way, and besides, don't I want to avoid another painful drive and get to hospital sooner?  I decide she right. I'm looking forward to a hospital bed.

The helicopter arrives.  A paramedic takes a picture of the jeep because he can't believe I'm able to walk to the helicopter and joke around with the paramedics.  They say I'm the best patient ever.  I blush.  I get in, we get flying.  I gotta admit I've always wanted to ride in a helicopter, and I'm excited for the hospital, so I decide this $55K is worth it.  The air ambulance crew puts in an IV, and and I mostly sleep but I get some great views, especially of the terrain as it leaving.

On my request, I arrive at the same hospital as my buddy.  It's kind of cool to get pulled off a helicopter and rolled into the emergency on a stretcher with a full complement of people around.  I get X-Rayed.  I've broken my back, but just a single vertebrae, the L1.  Compression fracture.  I get a room upstairs.  My buddy is much worse.  He's broken five vertebrae, two of them have even split.  His brain is also bleeding.  He's in Emergency surgery right away, for like 9 hours, they put rods in his back and screw his vertebrae back together.  

My big Mormon family (not just my parents and siblings, but my aunts and uncles, cousins, the grandparents too) comes and visits and freaks out, this hospital is only about 20 minutes from my hometown.  I tell them this exact story.  Once they leave I can't help but cry out of relief.  After all that, that hospital bed really was everything I hoped it was that night.

Epilogue:  This happened on May 31/June 1.  The dialogue is as accurate as I can remember.  I would say over 65% of it is verbatim, the rest is a close paraphrase.  Most importantly, my buddy recovered.  He was in in-patient therapy at the hospital for about a month and using a wheelchair, then went to live with an aunt who was an emergency room nurse and her retired husband who could look after him while he went to physical therapy.  He was on crutches for awhile, but was walking around with just a brace by the time he was cleared to go back to work and finish his term four months later. He made it back to the park and was able to work a several more months before his term ended a couple of weeks ago.  He will be working at a ski resort in Colorado this winter. My summer internship ended before I was cleared to return to work :/  Either way, other than us being occasionally sore and dealing with medical bills, it's crazy to believe this happened all of 6 months and we are damn lucky to have made it.

There's a certian point in drunkenness the thought of sex doesn't even cross your mind. 
"I'm struggling with this. My friend came out as genderqueer and pansexual. I understand being trans and being bisexual, those make sense to me.  But by genderqueer he's saying he doesn't identify as a man *or* a woman.  And pansexual means he's attracted to all genders, not just men and women.

I just...don't get it."

"The standard you walk past is the standard you accept.

Meaning if you see something that isn't right whether that be someone getting bullied or messed with or something at work that isn't right and you move on without saying something means you are now part of the problem. Stand up for someone every once in a while, you would be surprised how good it feels. "

"Oh god. Cringe story incoming. This happened about three summers ago.

Was 20 years old in Cancun and I started hooking up with this girl who was also from the US. It was just her and her friend who were both 18.

Few days in her and I were regularly doing the deed and I was sleeping in their hotel room. After a while they begin talking to each other and constantly drop hints about having a threesome. The friend (who was definitely hotter) even asked me ""are you going to also share some dick with me"" in front of the other girl.

I was young, dumb, and I thought she was just joking. With each passing day it makes me cringe realizing that was literally an orgy with two 18 year olds handed to me on a platter and I was too dumb to take the chance. Throughout the vacation they spoke about threesomes (in general) and how they've always wanted to have one. I have no idea how it did not click. 

FUCK. 

I'm cringing still to this day typing this. Anyways Lindsay and Andrea I'm here if you still wanna bang.

"I think that women are very critical of men over expressing their emotions.

As for flirting with men, we're fairly easy. A bisexual girl I used to date just threw me dirty jokes and one liners like a dude would. It worked really well. Either way, a new target might really help you."

"So my friend and I went backpacking across Europe. In one of our hostels we got lucky and were placed in a 3 bed room, nice and private. That night I happened to be hooking up with a girl from our hostel (I kinda pulled a steal yo girl move because the guy talking to her for the past two days was a bit of an asshole to me. The dude from Ireland was trying to lecture me about us 2nd amendment rights ). Anyway we take the cab from a club back to our hostel and we stumble into our room where my friend was asleep. She said ""do you want to go to the bathroom, your friend is here""I said ""no its okay he wont wake up"" That was a total lie because my friend is the lightest sleeper I know. For the next 15m he pretended to be asleep while we were pounding away at each other literally 3 feet away from him. He opened his eyes once or twice to he greeted with my hairy butthole winking at him. The next day he told me he wasn't sure if he was angry at me because I had sex with someone right in front of him or that I woke him up at 3am....it was all good because he returned the favor a few days later "
I don't even think that's petty. Sounds really crazy or really stupid. She's treating them like flowers. That's so weird.
"Yes. Clothing is used by people to communicate a lot about ourselves, whether that message is true or not. Wearing a suit still carries a lot of signs of professionalism, wealth and power. Even if a relatively poor, unimportant person can still own and wear a suit, and there are many reasons for wearing one than just doing business, the image of the suit (especially if it's well tailored and fits well) will communicate to many, at least subconsciously, that you must have some kind of success or power. 

This effect only goes so far, and is largely tied to first impressions, and can also backfire in cases where a suit is wildly out of place (such as a biker bar or a keg party) or in cases where the first impression is actually negative  due to suits also being more urban/suburban and being less common daily attire in more rural areas."
"Why people can't fucking use their blinkers. 

Why people drive like a reckless asshole.

Why people don't wear seatbelts.

This is an unpopular opinion, I think, but I have literally no sympathy for someone who wrecks their car driving like an asshole. I feel sorry for the family and friends that have to deal with the outcome, but not the person and what happens to them. When you drive reckless you're not only endangering yourself, but you're endangering others and inconveniencing them if you crash."
Do I win something? Because I feel pretty good about my odds with this one.
this might explain why he sounded so surprised when I asked him :/

"&gt; Like a BigMac, vaginas appeal to our other senses more than our vision. We know a BigMac tastes delicious, hence why we gobble it down despite it looking like old slop between two buns. The Vagina is the same, we know it provides the best feeling in the world, aside from love. So we forgive the visual presentation and even convince ourselves they look beautiful due to its worth to our other senses.

Bruh some vaginas are straight up beautiful though, like works of art."
"Please convey ""Bearstabber"" to them with my highest regards."
Met her on Tinder. Heard her talk with a shitty accent on the first date. There was no second date.
I was surprised to see how small a penis can be when it's flaccid. Before I met my current boyfriend I only had flings/casual hook ups in the past which only resulted in me seeing their penis once they were already hard. I always just assumed a flaccid penis was not that much shorter than its erect form. But now I understand why people say 'grower not a shower'!
"Wet washcloth with warm water.  Scrub gently.  Pat dry with towel.

Me: WTF. I don't know dude. Jesus.

Her: What!? How could you say that!? I would die for you.

Me: Don't do that! Worry about yourself.

She legitimately got mad at me for such an unfair, crazy question. Needless to say we didn't last long together."

"I'm not sure how trivial this might be, but I am biased. [This saved my life a few years ago.](http://imgur.com/gallery/qJDRn) I was driving 65 mph on an empty, dark, wet highway at 1 am and suddenly everything flash-froze. It went from being wet pavement to frozen pavement in a heartbeat. Suddenly, my car was completely sideways going down the highway. Luckily, I had seen this the night before and instantly remembered it after Ron Swanson's face came to my head for some fucking reason (pretty sure he's my spirit animal).

Basically, turn your wheels back toward where you want go. In this case, straight down the road. You'll whip back around and want to point them back where you want to go again. You'll repeat the process, whipping back and forth until you're straight again. Do NOT slam on the brakes. In my case, I was in cruise control and had to just *tap* on the brakes to disengage it. Also, if the weather is even THINKING about presenting icy road conditions, don't use cruise control.

"Watching other people play video games on youtube.

It baffles me.  I understand watching professional E-Sports.  That's watching people at the top of their form doing things that you can't do.  That's rooting for teams.  That I get.  It's like watching Monday Night Football.

But what I don't get is watching some slap-dick stumbling his way through a game and recording it all for youtube.  This is like watching someone showing you home video of his after work co-ed flag football games.  

This used to be the punishment older brothers handed out to little brothers: ""here, you can watch me play.  Hold this controller that isn't plugged in"""

"This girl looked just like Brandy from Joe Dirt when she came riding in on that horse.  She was perfect in every way, really to perfect.  Not only was she sweet and kind and supportive of everything I did, she was *always* ready for sex.  She was a giver in that regard to an extreme point that I had to tell her many times she had to keep her hands off my dick because she was making it raw with all her attention.  We couldn't watch a movie together without her wanting to suck and jack me off 3 or 4 times.  Sounds great right?  Not to mention she was a dead-ringer for [this] (http://c8.alamy.com/comp/BPH95M/brittany-daniel-joe-dirt-2001-BPH95M.jpg) as I said.  Well here comes my douchiness.  She never wanted to have sex without a condom nor did she want me to give her oral sex which was hard to deal with because she had an adorable vagina with a very fine tuft of blonde hair and always smelled delicious..  This went on for about five months.  She knew all of my past exploits and wasn't the least bit jealous even though I was the only second guy she had been with.  She was 22, an RN, and  newly divorced from her high-school sweetheart.  One day she joined me when I was getting the results of a full check-up.  She was there to hear the doctor give me a clean bill of health for any STDs.  She knew I couldn't have children because the mumps ""fell"" on me and caused me to become sterile at the age of 3 so later on that evening I broached the subject again about having sex without a condom.  She flat out refused again.  Mind you, this was the **only** grief I ever ""suffered"" from this girl but my puzzlement over this got the best of me and I blurted out ""Do you have herpes or something you're not telling me about?"".  She immediately burst into tears and confessed that yes, her ex-husband had cheated on her and she had contracted it although she took medication and had never had an outbreak she couldn't bear to do to someone what her ex did to her.  I, in my youthful stupidity, all of a sudden saw her as unclean even though she was a victim.  I jumped on my high-horse with the excuse that she should have let me decide that for myself instead of hiding it from me which she wasn't really doing, she was simply deeply ashamed.  I believe this to be the pettiest thing I've ever done and wish daily I could turn back the clock because no woman has come close to treating me as good as she did.  I hope she found someone who wasn't a total shithead like me.

EDIT: typos"
Using a condom and also pulling out seems like the worst of both worlds...
You're a liar. No fucking way a woman was able to decide on something to eat.
"she used the word ""spontaneous/spontaneously"" constantly and never correctly"
"This is exactly how I feel. I'm straight, with no interest in being sexually or romantically involved with a man at all, but vaginas aren't something I think is all that great either.

What I like is the feminine **form**. Curves, soft angles, etc.

I think a lot of straight men feel that way, just like a lot of straight women.  When is the last time you heard a women talk about how much they specifically love penises?  It's the masculine form, or masculine traits they find attractive (generally).

Honestly, when I watch porn, what the dude looks like is just as important to me as what the woman looks like.  I don't want to watch some old, hairy, overweight man sweat all over someone for an hour.   The fact that most guys in porn look at least half way decent tells me I'm probably not alone. "
"&gt;It seemed rude to just walk away from the guy and the drink he just bought.

That's what he's banking on, your desire to avoid seeming ""rude"". You owe this guy nothing. If in his mind him buying you unasked for drinks means you owe him conversation/your time, that's on him. Say ""no thank you"" and walk away. Who cares if Miss Manners would approve?"
"&gt;I was recently told by a man that I always show my cleavage for attention. 

Most people dress in a way that flatters their form and accents their favorite parts. A girl showing off her boobs is no different than a guy who works out and switches to tighter shirts to show off his arms. Lots of people, to some degree anyway, dress for attention.

So I don't really get why people still make a huge deal out of cleavage.

"People who think all the good things in their life happened because ""thank you Jesus"". Once I spent a shitload of time translating documents and filling forms for my Mexican boyfriend, and when his visa was accepted, he said it was because Jesus was giving him a shot.

"Girl at a Halloween party hit me (it was either a playful punch on the shoulder or kicking my leg, I forget). I hit her back and she said ""that's why I like you, most boys would have run off."" Don't even remember what happened after that, we were pretty young.

Another time when a random girl at a science fair who was presenting her project next to mine complimented my hair and eyes, then asked if she was making me nervous. Forgot how I even responded but it was probably a weak ""yes"" or complete silence (fml).

Another time some random girl at my highschool said I have beautiful eyes, she was sitting at a table right next to mine so I figured she was taking to someone else. I smiled thinking it was funny she just randomly complimented someone like that, then I immediately got a deer in headlights look when I realized she was looking at me. I think I just said thank you or something and kept eating.

Another time I'm honestly not sure about was when I was valedictorian of my high school (not that impressive, small high school) and went to the salutatorian's graduation party. I think she liked me, being a small highschool we were all pretty close but it was still a little out of place that she hugged me a few times at the party and asked me to take pictures with her. She tended to be a really friendly person, so I'm not really sure.

Edit: damn mine aren't even that bad you all are fucking dense.

Edit 2: since so many people asked, look, look at [my special eyes](http://imgur.com/LKEhtVh)! (or just the one I guess) I think people mostly like the blonde hair blue eye combo, it's really the only thing I ever get random compliments on."

"You can't control feelings that you have, but you can reflect on them and think about if they are warranted and make deliberate efforts about how if affects your actions.

Say you're feeling jealous. Think about if it really makes sense that you should be jealous in the situation. Think about how it's important to have trust in a relationship, and that if you really trust her then what purpose does that jealousy serve. Think about how *acting* overprotective and jealous can affect her and affect the relationship. If the conclusion is that your jealousy is a negative, take a deep breath and try to just let it go because you trust her. (If you don't, that's a probem) 

Try to reframe situations that make you jealous. Simple example: a guy you don't know talks to her at a bar. Maybe your first reaction is to be jealous and think he's trying to get with her. Maybe he is, but so what she's with you. Don't be angry/jealous. Instead, think about how this other guys wants your girlfriend, but she chose you. Let yourself feel a little smug about it, why not. If you trust her, it's not a threat."

"Also understand that not everyone can grow a beard. Some kids will like a Civil War general by age 17. Some won't until their twenties. Some, like my Navajo and my Korean bros can't grow but a couple stragglers. I can grow a great, woolly, red goatee but it's too thin on my cheeks to rock a bitchin' pair of mutton chops. We are all in our thirties. The answer here is enough critical self evaluation to decide if the attempt looks okay or if you're better off clean shaven or closely trimmed. I still want some mutton chops but it just isn't in the cards and looks disgusting when I try. 

Also use conditioner. Let it soak in for a minute while you wash your stinky bits. Never suck on or chew your beard, your mouth acid degrades it. Tugging on it makes it look scattered. "

I know men who are kind &amp; caring who have had a relationship with a bitch. Once she's done with him, rather than ending it amicably, she takes out an AVO, keeps all the furniture, household goods &amp; jewelry. He leaves with nothing and can't get it back due to the AVO."

I managed to miss two HUGE signals in ONE DAY. So my middle school did Relay for Life on a pretty grand scale where 6 or 7 schools got together at mine and set up tents all around the football track for a whole Saturday, like 12-10 or so. It was a huge event and probably 90% of students participated. I had two girls from another school come up to my friend and me, sit down with us in the grass, and basically talk about how cute we were (pretty sure that exact word was used). I mean, this was a layup, I was two feet from the basket. For some reason I stopped talking to them. One of them then came up about an hour later and slapped me on the ass, so obviously I immediately went and hugged one of my male friends. That's painful enough.

Later in the day, I was walking around the track with another friend of mine, and a girl who had flirted with me on occasion in class came up and LITERALLY HELD MY HAND AND I DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT HER. I just can't explain it, I thought both girls were pretty cute and I was very interested in dating. I have nothing.

If I could go back in time, I would go back and punch 15 year old me in the face."

"I find a lot of women can't seem to separate men in fiction from men in real life. Sorry, but you're not going to find that perfect Mr. Darcy or Grey or whatever.

I know a girl who is holding out for a man who's handsome, 6'2"" or taller, fit, alpha-type man's man, good with his hands (as in fixing things), feminist, makes 6-figures, got at least a graduate degree, appreciates jazz and classical music, etc. That man doesn't exist and if he did, he wouldn't be dating her. He'd be with a 22 year old supermodel. "
"Listen, let's be realistic.

Sex isn't the most important thing, but until you get it you feel like a lesser person. 

You feel as though you aren't as sexually attractive as every single other person who has fucked. And then once you get it, you walk with a different kind of aura.

You can say you fucked without having to lie to your friends, any of your friends that actually saw you bring the girl home, know you fucked. It's actual concrete proof. You seem like the man in your social circle who pulls.

Eventually your natural aura becomes actual confidence. 

You can talk to girls without the underlying desperation that you need them to become a part of society by losing your virginity.

Eventually that natural aura begins to attract other women to you, your friends see it and suddenly start asking you for advice with women.

Suddenly girls you see around are adding *you* on Facebook. Asking *you* if you're coming to that party later, double texting you when you forgot to reply earlier.

Basically...

If sex truly doesn't define you, then you're good and don't need to be convinced by anyone, but theres no point trying to convince someone who believe it isn't everything, because it is. And unless they don't care what every single person around them thinks, it **will** affect their lives.

Instead of wasting your time telling them that one of the most important parts of becoming a ""man"" isn't important at all.

You need to explain to them the best way to raise their sexual appeal and overall confidence, things that lead to sex.

- going to the gym and lifting heavy weights 

- having a hobby in life they're passionate about

- having friends that empower you

The issue at hand is not the sex. It's why they haven't been able to have sex.

Paying a few hundred for an escort isn't going to solve the issue.

It's not the sex, it's the fact that for their entire lives, in their mind they think; "" there hasn't been one single girl on the entire fucking planet who liked me enough to actually want to have sex with me"".

I wish all the virgins out there luck, and the one piece of advice I would give is to, instead of focusing on the sex itself, focus on what you need to do in order to become a guy that girls want to have sex with."

"&gt; Also, many cool games don't even have the option for a woman version of the main character and I don't relate to the story as much if I am playing as a man. Imagine if you as a man were forced to play only as a woman in most games. It's just not as relatable.

"Waking up paralyzed (by medication) on a ventilator, about 4 hours into a 24-hour course of treatment.  Because I'd just had a near drowning, they had me on a high-pressure, low-respirations/minute (2 or 3?) to prevent scarring in my lungs.  Becoming fully conscious, unable to move or even open my eyes, and not being able to breathe until a machine gives me an inhale or an exhale about every 20-30 seconds... terrifying.

Then the kidney stones.  That pain was bad enough, but the surgical treatment was on a whole different level.  The stent they left in there for a week was nearly as painful as the stones themselves, and shoving a 2-foot long, pencil-diameter tube up my wang while I'm conscious and standing to grab the stent and pull it out... just no.

"If you mean the early dating stage of the relationship, then it's 

1) the fact that you always have to come up with shit to do because most women don't take the initiative AND also aren't straightforward about what they want. One or the other is manageable but once it becomes a cocktail it becomes a fucking headache.

2) never being sure where you're at in the relationship, including whether or not you're at a stage in the relationship you can ask where you are in the relationship.

3) balancing how much you can be yourself and show affection with how much it might put her off or give her the wrong idea.

Basically it's a tough balancing act at the beginning. It doesn't get easier the deeper the relationship becomes but at least I feel like you can be yourself more. That's all relationships feel like, is finding the one lady that accepts you and you accept her."
"Trans makes sense to me, I can understand someone feeling like they've been assigned the wrong gender. And the experience of trans people is well documented. Being trans is like being gay - different, and something we need to adjust to, but not wrong.

"She's bold and confident, speaks her mind, doesn't care what others think, and is kind of crude in terms of humor, swearing, and peeing outside at parties/bonfires/walking around the city.  She enjoys arguesations.  She's also way into the outdoors, a weeklong backpacking trip would be an ideal vacation for her.  She also likes traveling the world for the experience, not the social media points, and uses Couchsurfing/cheap hostels and is more than willing to sacrifice luxuries for more travel time.  She's spontaneous and down for last minute road trips/camping.  Hopefully she likes weed and beer or whisky too, and has an open attitude to things like shrooms.  Her ideal weekend either involves hiking or kayaking, but considers staying in bed, drinking/smoking weed, having an all-day sex marathon and cooking a hearty meal in between sex just as good.  Lastly she thinks most traditional gender roles are BS, but loves being a woman and being feminine.

I can say from experience when I consider a girl to be a ""dream girl"" in terms of personality that I really don't care what she looks like as long as she's in shape, feminine (not androgynous), and not addicted to meth/crack.  I'll end insanely attracted to her and want to be with her very badly. "

"Not understanding how they feel. Natively. 

Generally, women are socialized quite a bit differently than men are, so the way we take in, process, and experience things is vastly different.

So when a woman gets mad at me for ""just not understanding"", it strikes me as odd. How can I understand if I haven't lived through what you have, experienced what you have, and you either can't or won't explain it to me?"

"I go through chicken like a one-man avian apocalypse. It's a cheap alternative to beef that is generally better for you since it's leaner. Boneless breasts are the easiest no-fuss option and are incredibly versatile. You can pound them thin, season them up, and just pan-sear them for a quick protein portion of an easy dinner. Or you can dress them up by wrapping them around stuffing and baking, etc. Or you can thinly slice them and throw them in a quick stirfry.

I also buy a ton of chicken thighs. They're cheaper, but they make the best soup/stews.

In general, the considerations for chicken aren't that different from steak besides the fact that you want to cook chicken almost completely through (carry-over cooking will take it the rest of the way). You're still looking at the standard season, color, and finish techniques. One thing I like about chicken over steak is that I think its neutral flavor lends itself really well to sauces of a wide variety of flavor profiles."

And my ideal woman may be dark skinned too, another thing that's never presented in media as desirable (it's almost exclusively white girls)."

"You have two options, go with it, accept that you're a rebound, and maybe get laid. With the understanding that the friendship is probably gonna be totally fucked permanently.

Or  you can talk to her about and say, ""hey,  I like our friendship but I feel like your treating me like a rebound and I'm not ok with that. I'll hear you out, I'll spend time with you the way I always have, but I can't be filling that gap in your life the way you want me to""

"I'd say it's not that the male body is disgusting, or not appealing, or anything really. It's more about the total *lack of attraction* to it.

Since i go nowhere anymore without the kids i don't get to meet women allot. Especially as a single father of 5, no way that's happening. Even if she had to l would almost triple her kid situation.

"It wasn't any one thing. 

One of my best friends that I've known since elementary school drinks a lot. However, I always looked up to him because he was charismatic and generally a really good friend. 

But gradually I noticed his alcohol intake was becoming a problem. Little things, like insisting on stopping for beers for events that don't call for alcohol (like watching a movie). He would visit and get zombie-like drunk, but I would make excuses for him ""oh well he's just in vacation mode.""

He ended up moving far away, and then started having periodic rants at me and other friends about how he feels we don't support him enough. We would hang out and he would basically spend the time ranting about how all his friends are assholes. He would say inappropriate things to my other friends who would ask me not to bring him over anymore. 

Finally I told him my concerns about his drinking and his ranting. He went off on me about how I'm a shitty friend. He complained that I've ""been up my wife's ass for a long time"" and said some negative things about my ability in my career.

He told me to stop talking to him. So I did and honestly, things have been better. "

"Because modern dating culture has evolved into a ritual of providing the least amount of effort and taking the least amount of risk possible, while still hoping for great reward (in most cases: casual sex.) This is enhanced by the fact that it's *so easy* to meet up with people these days through text, social media, and online dating apps. Dating went from being a formal, romantic thing to be a casual thing where one could bail at the drop of a hat. There's both pros and cons to this. 

I still used the word ""date"" when I was single, generally in jest by saying something like ""It's a date! ;)"" or whatever. I avoided the term ""hang out"" though, rather opting to say the actual activity like ""Lets go out for dinner"" or ""Would you like to get drinks sometime?"" I've never dated within my friend group so going out on a first date was always a date activity, not just watching tv on someone's couch. 

If you want to do something date like with someone you're interested in, then ask them on date like activity: movie, drinks, dinner, a comedy show, coffee and a walk in a park. It will be pretty obvious that this is more special than a regular hang out and set the tone for things like kissing or affection at the end of your time together. "
"It becomes a self-reinforcing cycle because a lot of guys have no idea how to react if a woman does approach them. So the guy doesn't register that he's being hit on, or he is suspicious or dismissive (""Alright, which of my friends put you up to this?""), or he gives in to nervous laughter which the poor girl interprets as being laughed at, or any of a bunch of other possible misunderstandings.  The script most people have pre-loaded is that the dude does the approaching, so deviations from that can lead to social awkwardness, and we all know how much humans luuuuuuuuuv social awkwardness.

Plus there's a small minority of asses out there who insist that ""Man must be the pursuer"" and call women desperate or slutty if they initiate.

"Because it's way too close to home for most men (even if their dicks are 8"" long). "
well you can contour your tits...
"I don't think this advice is likely to help anyone who has had trouble getting dates.  

It's like saying, ""Stop applying for jobs, and a hiring manager will cold call you, offering a job.""  

No, it's worse than that: ""Stop putting a line in the water, and fish will begin to leap into your boat, having been miraculously de-boned, breaded, and deep-fried.  Yes, friends, Jesus will not only multiply your bounty, but he'll do all the prep work for you.""  

All that to say: It *could* happen.  But I don't like the odds.

If ""stop chasing"" women only means ""stop showing interest, but continue meeting"" women, I still don't think that's effective.  People like attention.  After you've done a few years' worth of dating women, you'll find that they only rarely ask you out first.  So if you meet someone, and you hit it off, but you completely refuse to ask her out (or touch her first, or kiss her first, etc.), whatever ""chase"" you think she's giving will end after a few steps.  They won't generally go to such impressive lengths to hang onto your attention.  

I don't want to get into whether that's ""good"" or ""bad.""  I'm only meaning to share suggestions that might help you think about these things practically.  If you want to get involved with someone you think is really fantastic, you must be prepared to take a chance on being disappointed.  If you're too proud to do at least a little bit of ""chasing"" once in a while, then you're too proud to date."
Almost everything they wear? Definitely attention.

"Oh man I feel you. Dated a Korean girl who was lovely. She was thoughtful, funny, very intelligent, gorgeous. I didn't notice it at first because I had a cold when i first got with her and it lasts a while for me, but her pussy smelled like kimchi. Put a whole new meaning to you are what you eat. Couldn't last. "
Have you considered Bearstabber as an alternative?
"The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) gets the largest part of my charitable donations. 

Pretty much everyone using this site ought to support them, they're one of the main entities fighting for digital rights. (Although primarily, but not exclusively in the US).

Copyright reform, net neutrality, fixing the broken ""anti-hacking"" laws, protecting encryption, anti-surveillance, etc.

And, unlike many charities, they actually have good ratings from the watchdogs in terms of efficiency in how they raise and use that money. [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=7576)"
"*He said ""I wanna see you again*

*But I'm stuck in colder weather*

*Maybe tomorrow will be better.*

*Can I call you then?""*

*She said ""you're a ramblin' man*

*And you ain't ever gonna change.*

*You got a gypsy soul to blame and you were born for leavin' ""*

"A sparse fedora collection. I'm sorry I'm not rich enough to afford a different fedora for every day of the month, I'm sorry I have to make due with just a few nice fedoras (that I keep in pristine condition, on display next to my trenchcoat and daisho) yet somehow it is always m'lady's opinion that this makes me completely undateable."
So in which red state did you receive your sex education?
"Making the first move.

Guys get shit from girls if they walk up and dance with them in a club. Guys get shit for asking for numbers from strangers. Guys get shit for complimenting random girls. 

Yet we girls get no shit and don't give no shits.


Wtf?"
Asking her where she wants to go for dinner

Lower your expectations. That'll at least dull the strong emotions you're experiencing when things don't go your way.
Because I grew up in a very fit culture and was not ready to admit I liked fat girls.
"Smooth. Very sweet of you, but also smooth."
"I ran into a girl in college that I was introduced to in high school and I remembered her name so she said that was creepy.  So, remembering people is creepy."
How is that petty?
"Okcupid. Turns out she was a 9/11 truther, believed the Sandy Hook shooting was a ploy to take away our guns, and had disgusting dirty dreds almost down to her waist. 

This was my best date in a decade."
Ate with her mouth open. If I wanted to look at a cow masticating I'd work on a farm. 
Sex is a universal language that transcends genders or cultures.
She said that all guys want is a fuck.
"I think it appears that way more with women who have blonde eyelashes... At least in my experience. 

When I don't wear mascara I look pretty different because my eyelashes are so light. But that's the only eye makeup I wear and I don't even apply that much. When I go without everyone thinks I'm tired. "
