Gomez and Morticia Addams. 
They need to stop hitting on (particularly significantly younger) cashiers and other people paid to be nice to them.
The vast majority of men are unattractive because they don't put forth any effort 
Maybe not the best - because there are other great couples listed here - but Bob and Linda from Bob's Burgers make a cute pair to watch.
"As soon as their haircuts look perfectly grown out, they get it all lopped off again. 

"
"Biggest turn off: Filthy bathroom. 

Its not uncommon for me to go use the bathroom at a guy's place and find mold in the shower, streaks on the toilet, and pubes littering the floor.

I always tell my guy friends, if you want women to stay over you HAVE to clean your bathroom. No one is going to want to spend the night here if they feel like they'll come out of your shower dirtier than when they went in."
"Women may refrain from making comments because everyone else is hostile to women. Also ""male as default"" syndrome... people just assume everyone is a dude unless stated otherwise in gender neutral topics.

Also I've been a regular user on Reddit for maybe 5 years now, when I started it wasn't as evenly split. It was more like 70% dude so gross sexist things against women is basically ingrained in the culture here. It's gotten a lot better :)"
"With the guys I dated before my current SO, I noticed an expectation that I mingle and spend time with their friend group while they have no intentions of doing the same with mine. They might meet my friends once over drinks, but they would never want to hang out on the regular with my friends. Meanwhile, sometimes the only way I could see them was if I was going to hang with their own friend group."
How has no one said Turk and JD yet?
"If a woman puts a lot of time and effort into her appearance, she's fake and high maintenance. But if she doesn't put *enough* time into her appearance, she's lazy and unattractive. "
"Insisting that something that happened, didn't, or happened in a different way. As an example I read once, the man told his girlfriend that he didn't care about her sexual pleasure when they were having a fight and she stormed out, but once she came home, he told her he'd never said anything of the sort.

It's an ugly, ugly thing calculated to make you not trust yourself. Especially when you are still upset and they seem calm and reasonable."
"Dan and Roseanne Conner. Maybe I'm being swayed by the fact that they were a lower-middle class working family, but they fought like normal couples and there was a real love and connection there. They were married but also best friends. They had friendships outside of the marriage. They had real life issues with their kids (running away/young marriage with Becky, depression with Darlene). They hated their jobs, and supported each other when they just couldn't take it anymore. AND they weren't supermodels (or the typical sitcom ""hot wife/fat husband"")."
"I'm tired of hearing them call women crazy after doing really assholish things to drive them crazy. If pretty much every woman you date turns out to be crazy maybe it's time for some self reflection. 

Also I've heard of plenty of guys doing the same things that women are called crazy for yet guys are not generalized that way. It's always that guy is crazy versus women are crazy."
"In my experience, an expectation that she has to be ""cool"" all the time, and must never express any emotion or concern because that would be CRAZY. 

Like, I'm not okay with you sleeping over a girls house who you previously has relations with while you're visiting another city, and somehow that makes me jealous and possessive.  Or I'd like to spend more than two days a week having some quality time, but that makes me too clingy and needy. 

Another one is that guys want a woman who looks good and takes care of herself, but many are not willing to do the same. When I did online dating, I had a not insignificant number of men message me who clearly had never seen the inside of the gym, yet scoffed when I said fitness was important to me. I eat healthy, run half marathons, and have a healthy BMI, yet I'm shallow for not wanting a guy who can't see his dick because his gut is in the way. "
Many men value looks significantly more than anything else in a woman.
Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope
"I never used to have any, but after 5 years spent on reddit, I've learned that so many of them are sexist. It's fucking disappointing. 

I've never even met one of these people in real life. But it worries me that perhaps I *have*, and he was just good at hiding it because he knows he can't say that shit in real life. But like... they are *all over* reddit, so they must exist somewhere in real life."
Arthur and Molly Weasley. relationshipgoals
"I saw a comment on the other thread saying ""I don't shave because I hate shaving"". Completely fair. 

But I wonder how many men have that attitude and still expect women to shave their entire body. "
"Men identify too closely to their interests. Just because I don't like a band, sports team, etc. you're deeply into doesn't mean I don't like you. Calm down. And in turn they invalidate women interests in beauty and call us vain and shallow. "
"I don't really care if people assume I'm male online but I do find the ""male as default"" syndrome strange.

I remember a stupid project in high school was to design a robot.  I gave my robot a female name and referred to her as a female.  My teacher asked why I thought it was necessary to give her a gender.  I pointed out that the other students had designed robots with male names and referred to their robots using male pronouns.  His response was that this was normal and I was just trying to be special.  So for him, male robots were the default and female robots were unnecessarily gendered.  I was only 12 so I wasn't really clued in on what was going on but looking back it makes my blood boil."
"Just because you're nice to me doesn't mean I owe you anything. I think nice people are wonderful, but guys who put themselves into the ""Nice Guys"" category like its some kind pussy voucher are the fucking worst."
"Just because 53% of redditors are male, doesn't mean 53% of the content on Reddit is posed by men. It's essentially a vicious cycle where because a lot of subs are hostile to women, women don't post (or even read) there in anywhere close to proportional numbers."
"Wash and Zoe from Firefly. They have their differences and problems, but they work through them and at the end of the day they still love each other so much."
"I think it's important to specify that she took an active role in getting them fired.  

&gt;Two people have gotten fired for not leaving her alone.

Implies that she took the abuse, and eventually someone noticed and they were fired.  

&gt;She's gotten two people fired for not leaving her alone.

Implies she's the one who got them fired, which is *great*.  She refused to stand by and take the harassment, and instead reported it to her manager.

Consider it again with this wording

&gt;She reported two people for harassment, which got them fired.

Carries a different connotation than

&gt;Two people were reported for harassing her, which got them fired."
"Reminds me of that tumblr post: 

""girls are amazing i just watched my friend change 8 times before picking an outfit you girls are so dedicated to looking good i can’t believe there are men out there sitting in their cum stained sweatpants trying to tell you what you’re allowed to wear"" "
"Throw pillows are absolutely useless and I hate them. If I cannot put my head on it, it has no business being a pillow. "
"Y'all have way too many unrealistic expectations of sex from porn. At least this is what I've found with younger guys.

Granted, I haven't slept with that many people, but the younger ones I've been with or spoken to about sex seem to think it's normal and common for all women to go full anal immediately, have threesomes, be into being choked, are completely repulsed by pubes etc.

Granted that's not all, but it's certainly a concerning pattern I've noticed. I work with a lot of young people and  the ideas about what's realistic and common are shocking. "
They expect women to put in all the effort while complaining that women who do that are high maintenanced. 
Gaslighting
"Sex is incredible.  All that increased blood flow in your pelvic area leads to wonderful orgasms.

Feeling your child grow is an amazing, life affirming feeling.

Your breasts look fantastic! 

Food tastes incredible in the later months.  Not so much in the early months if you have pregnancy sickness.  Pregnant women have a stronger sense of smell making food taste better, too.  

Pregnant women have stronger nails.  

You are more in tune with your body.  

When you talk or sing to your baby the baby can respond...newborns know the voices of their family, they have been listening to muffled voices for some weeks prior to birth.

You get to rest and not feel guilty."
"turn off: dishes that seem clean, but in fact have that subtle greasy layer from being washed without enough soap/in filthy water. by far the most common offender"
I am a firm believer that you should always close the toilet lid after doing your business. Just friggin close the damn lid. DO IT.
"I get frustrated by men who continue to be friends with horrid guys because they have one thing in common with them. ""Yeah, Jeff is kind of racist and sexist and rude and gross, but we golf together once a week so he's invited to all our social gatherings."" 
Also goes for guys they've known forever, but I know women who are guilty of that, so that's just a people thing."
"Thinking that every polite gesture is flirting or a sign of interest. No, your waitress most likely doesn't want to date you. She's literally paid to be nice to you."
That they're not that different from women.
"My hair was dirty. 

Also- it occurred to me that there were homeless squirrels after hurricane sandy knocked down the trees. "
"&gt; She's gotten two people fired for not leaving her alone.

*Two people have gotten fired for not leaving her alone."
"That I be in to everything they like. In my experience, I've found a guy's interest in me has increased when he learns that I like something he does. Which you know, that's cool. Common interests are great. But then it becomes a pop quiz... do I like this too? How about this? And I feel like every time I say I do, I gain a point and every time I say I don't, I lose a point. And my interests are never really talked about unless they are also one of his interests.

This has happened to me a lot with ""nerdy"" guys. They find out I read fantasy books, play video games and watch the odd anime and they think I'm awesome. And if one of my other hobbies - like makeup or pop music or reading non-fantasy/sci-fi books come up they get glossed over. Especially the more ""girly"" hobbies. 

Though it's not just the nerdy guys. A friend of mine broke up with a guy she was seeing because all he talked about was basketball and all he wanted to do with her was watch basketball games and get her into basketball. "

"The ""cool girl"" from 'Gone Girl' comes to mind. The defining compliment that many men think is ""cool girl"" - she's DTF all the time, requires nothing in return except watching movies and hanging out with friends, always looks flawless and is thin and in good shape. But the guy doesn't have to be and ""can't help what he's attracted to"""
"That the more time I spend on reddit, the less I like men. The reddit representation is shockingly sexist, racist and generally unlikable. Most ""jokes"" are centered around their penis or penis feelings. 

Then I turn off my computer and hang out with my guy friends and fiance and remember that decent men exist. 

If it weren't for them, I'd likely swear off hanging out with guys as I apparently have less than zero in common with them. "
"Sometimes when I comment, responders assume I'm male. Sometimes I correct them, usually not. My user name doesn't indicate gender. 

So maybe a lot of commenters are women, but assumed to be men. "
"""give me nudes""

""no""

""slut""

Oh okay"
"I think men are more shallow than women. 

Edit. I want to rephrase this. Men are allowed to be more shallow than women. A woman's preference is more likely be seen as shallow, especially on reddit. "
"Maybe it will get better with age, but right now I know so many guys that will freak out over the tiniest amount of body hair on a woman (e.g. When I was 15, a guy told me that the (sparse, blonde) hair on my stomach was not feminine and that I should please shave it), but refuse to trim anything themselves."
"Most of them are balls-deep in denial over the historical (and current) treatment of women.  This might partially be because they're not really privy to the conversations we have amongst ourselves about how Jane's supervisor keeps trying to corner her in the stockroom, or how Anne gave up her career to raise three kids for a husband who comes home drunk and gambles all their money away, and how she can't find a job so she can divorce because she's been out of the workforce too long.  Granted, most of them also don't even believe these conversations exist, so..."
"Men complain that women will only date men 6ft+,  but then complain if the woman is taller than them, or get annoyed when they wear heels."
"I think some men have trouble with empathy. Not to say they're terrible people, just that they have difficulty putting themselves in other people's  (usually women) shoes."
"Oh god yes. 

'Should I get my hair cut? Is it too long?'
'No, definitely not too long! It looks perfect at that length.'
'What's that? Get my hair cut? All off? Ok!'"
"I think most men have a baseline level of attractiveness that they cut anyone off who's under that.  Once that baseline has been reached, it doesn't need to be exceeded by much in order to be good.  At least that's how I see it."
"The ever-popular (at least on Reddit) - girl must be ""pure"" ^(^read: ^virgin ^or ^low ^amount ^of ^partners) but the man's partner count is completely irrelevant. "
"If someone brings in treats to the office, you have three options: 

1) take a whole treat
2) don't take any treat
3) share a treat with another person who also doesn't want a whole treat

Do not be that asshole and mangle a perfectly good treat with blunt instruments to carve away approximately half, and then leave the other, fatally damaged half in the box that no one will want to eat after you got your grubby paws all over it and squished it trying to cut it with a stapler."
"There was a thread on r/relationships recently where a guy was like, ""My girlfriend is really down-to-earth and awesome, but I'm afraid she might be too vain for me."" His reasons? She showers every day, gets her eyebrows plucked, eats well and wears night cream. It was insane."
"Lol, for one that so many men seem to think our lives revolve around relationships with them."
Kitty and Red Forman from That 70s Show. Love those two!
"Many men think that I should want to have sex with them after 3 dates, but not have had too many partners because that's slutty. "
"""Hey, that was a great date!  Do you want to come upstairs and have a drink with me?""

""Aw, thanks but I've gotta feed my cat.""

""OK, no drink, but just for a second!  I want to show you that youtube video I was talking about!""

""OK, I guess I can just watch a youtube video""

*time passes*

""But why would she come up to my apartment if she didn't want to have sex with me?  Everybody knows that's what that means!"""
"I always used to order gin and tonics, but one time, I was in a show in a bar where I was playing a princess, and I wanted to drink something ""girlier"" but when I got to the bar, I realized I didn't really know any girly drinks, so I wracked my brain for any tv shows or movies where somebody had a ""girly"" drink, and ordered a Tequila Sunrise.

The bartender was like ""What is wrong with you, I haven't made one of those since 1975,"" and that made it memorable to him, so now every time I go there, he's like ""Tequila Sunrise, right? hahaha"" so now I feel like I have to keep ordering it.  Also, it's tasty so whatever."
"On a friend level, someone who is laughing and joking with you most of the time, *except when they don't get their way.* Then they are vicious and lash out at you and make you feel like you've done something wrong. Much more insidious than someone who's a jerk all the time or in more obvious ways because they're normally fun to hang with and supportive in other ways."
"I worked at a store for a summer in college, and got promoted after only two months, but I had to leave when school started again because of transportation issues.

When I came back to the same job a year later, management had changed and I came back at entry level again, but with the understanding that I'd be promoted back to my old position soon.

The new manager was a real skeezeball. He was over 30 and married but always eyeballing these 15 year old girls who came to the store, asking me invasive questions about my personal life, even stuff like ""If I were single, would you date me?"" It was gross, but not so harassing I felt the need to leave.

But then 6 months into the job an employee was fired and he promoted one of the male employees over me. The employee he promoted had no management experience, and **I** was the one who had to train him on procedures, which seemed ridiculous. But the guy did have seniority on me so I shrugged it off.

The skeezy manager knew I wanted a promotion at this point, and even advised me to put in for higher positions at other stores nearby, which I did.

About a month later, the guy I trained got fired for stealing, leaving me as the only employee in the store eligible for promotion.

The manager transferred in another untrained guy from another store instead. And then asked me to train him. I told him to fuck himself, went out and got another job, and put in my two weeks."
"Most of the men I have had relationships with or witnessed in my friends relationships (that are unhappy or have broken up) are because the guys are incredibly selfish. They expect their female partner to cook, clean, take care of annoying adult stuff like bill paying and work. It's like now females are equal we just got more work. 

Every single one has been 'blindsided' by the breakups despite knowing their partner was unhappy about the unequal division of work for a long time before it happened. Since leaving my own guy my household work has gone down by 75% because not only did he refuse to help, he created more mess. I have been able to streamline my life and have way more me time because I am not always having to pick up his slack. I am watching the reverse happening to a friend who just moved in with her long term boyfriend. She is already aware of how little he is doing and she is not happy about it. He thinks life is great and can't understand why she is growing tired and cranky but he does nothing.

This is not all men by any stretch, but in my circle it seems like the guys who can't keep a girl is due to their laziness and ability to ignore how unhappy their  girlfriends and wives are. In my group this is the reason for 5 (soon to be 6) break ups. "

"You do NOT have to bring emotions into commercials!!!  It's so dumb!

Enter a wounded warrior holding a puppy for his daughter who has a terminal illness.  The daughter is so sad, then he pulls out DOUBLEMINT SPEARMINT GUM and confetti falls from the ceiling.  The puppy yelps happily.

"I'm 7mos with my first. In movies and stuff you always have that scene of somebody touching the belly and feeling the baby kick, which does happen, but it's actually kind of a rarity? Like, you can't predict the baby's movements and it's rarely constant. If you want to feel the baby you have to be really patient. I'm the only person who feels my baby move, and even my boyfriend has only felt him once or twice because he get impatient gives up on waiting.  

Anyway, in the last week the baby has gotten really, really active. There's lots of rolling (not a movement you can feel from the outside) and he's kicking AND punching at the same time. Dude is getting strong. It's been pretty exciting, but again, not something I can really share. Last night I woke up spooning my boyfriend and he said he thought he felt the baby kicking his back a bunch while I slept. As we were talking about it, the baby did a big kick and he was like, ""Was that him?! Is that it?!"" It was just a really lovely moment - to finally really have him share that with me. "

"In discussions, I disagree with them, which makes them think they just need to explain their point harder.

No.  I understand what you are saying.  I don't _agree with you_."
"Jealousy. Jealous behavior gets written off as normal a lot of the time. ""Oh, he's so protective of me"" or ""Oh it's just because they love me so much and can't stand the thought of losing me"" but more than the occasional twinge is usually a sign that someone is extremely insecure or thinks of their SO as their property. "
"THIS. 

I'm going to push all your emotional triggers until you justifiably are frustrated with me, but now systematically undermine and invalidate your emotions because they're inconvenient to me, so stop ""overreacting"", you're ""acting crazy"", you ""must be on your period"". Don't be so ""dramatic""."

"I was really craving a bbq chicken. I went to go and buy one and they were sold out. Went back the next day and they were sold out. Went back the day after that and they finally had some. Got home, put my chicken on the kitchen bench and went to go and pee or something, come back and my dog had pulled the chicken down from the bench and was casually eating a whole chicken and holy shit, I just burst into tears. I just wanted that chicken so fucking bad and life wasn't letting me have it -.- "
"Self-victimization.

I made fast friends with a girl a few years ago. She told me several heartwrenching stories about past experiences, and it seemed like she was just an incredibly unlucky person. She'd struggled through so much! We spent every day and almost every night together for about a month- not romantically, just because we both had boundary issues (another problematic behavior for sure).

The yellow flags became more frequent as time went on. Seemed like she was hurt by me increasingly often, but I wasn't always sure that I was in the wrong. Like we'd agree to meet at 6, but she'd call me at 5:30 asking why I wasn't there when we'd agreed on meeting at 5 (but we hadn't). She'd often point out how she used to be on the thinner side, like me, and make jabs that made me feel guilty for my weight (but then we'd go get dinner and she'd order two full meals for herself). I became annoyed by the constant stories of people being so mean to her when I realized she was telling me the same stories all the time, like a broken record of hurt.

Our friendship ended at Burning Man. We drove out together, and the 24 hour drive was miserable. She had a crush on this guy who ended up taking advantage of me while I was blacked out. When I told her, she furiously said, ""I can't believe you just fucked the only guy I have a crush on!!"" I didn't speak to her for a few days, and finally went back to clarify what I had told her before- that whatever she thought I had told her was way off base. She finally understood the unfortunate nature of my situation and we made up in the moment, but our friendship is over now and forever."
"Many men do not know how to effectively communicate when things aren't going well in a relationship. In my experience and many of my friends', a guy would much rather sweep shit under the rug than bring something up. And when something IS brought up by either party, there's usually quite a bit of passive aggression/avoiding the issue. 

I lost track of the number of times an ex-boyfriend has told me the shit that bothered him about the relationship AFTER the breakup. Well HECK, why couldn't you have told me this BEFORE to avoid this whole mess?"
"Don't forget that the ""cool girl"" has to be low maintenance (laid back) and also love things like eating burgers and pizza and drinking beer for every meal. It's an impossible double standard, because you simply CAN'T be thin and eat like a ""cool girl"" does in the movies. The only way it would work is if you work out like a fiend, but then you're no longer laid back due to being a gym rat. It's a catch 22. "
"I have seen comments on Reddit from salty dudes who think women will lose their mind or be devastated when sex robots become a thing because we simply can't compete. Like, nah, go on. Go be with the robots. "
"When they act like women who like ""nerdy"" things are some rare creature. The sci-fi genre was created by a woman (Mary Shelley). The Star Trek fandom back in the day was almost entirely compromised of women. I see just as many women walking around playing Pokemon Go as men. Women have always loved nerdy junk. We've always loved video games, we've always loved sci-fi and fantasy, we've always loved the same things that guys do. It's just that most of us try to hide it because we don't want to be ridiculed.

"I was blown away when I entered my partner's apartment for the first time! It's strange, but my first thought upon entering was ""holy shit, husband material."" Had never thought that before in my life.

I'm used to dating dirty punk boys so a fair amount of filth is something I've been accustomed to. Toilet paper roll on the back of the toilet because someone was too lazy to put it back on the holder, mildewy towels in the bathroom, dirty dishes in the sink, food messes, empty beer cans everywhere, oven being used as storage, fridge empty but for condiments, toilet seat up and covered in piss, bathroom sink full of beard trimmings, resinous paper clips lying on the coffee table, ashtrays full of butts, balled up receipts on the table, mysterious bad smells, neglected animals, all sorts of bad things.

Which is why I was amazed when I entered his apartment for the first time! It wasn't hotel-room clean, but the dishes were done, the floor had been swept recently, and there wasn't any accumulated grime anywhere. It smelled nice, like someone had recently burned a scented candle. The toilet seat was down. There was interesting art and posters on the walls, and several huge shelves were neatly organized with books and records. Healthy and obviously cared-for house plants were everywhere, a few carboys of homebrew were happily burbling in the corner, a well-maintained and clean bicycle was leaning against the wall. Cold beer and groceries were in the fridge (empty fridge = huge turn-off). It seemed that he wasn't pretending to be an adult, he just WAS an adult. It really struck me that his plants were all thriving. A man who can take care of something, help it grow, and give it the nourishment and care that it needs is very appealing.

The massive jar of weed on the coffee table immediately sealed the deal for me, but might've been a turnoff for someone else. And his bong was sparkling clean! 

Now we're engaged. And our apartment is cute as fuck, obviously."
"not being trusting of random men is a perfectly natural response to the fact that random men commit the majority of murders, rapes, physical assaults, kidnappings, and...pretty much all criminal acts? by like a wide margin?

"Penguins.

Penguins mate for life, but some male-male couples decide they want a baby so one of them will go off and convince a lady penguin that he only wants her. Then she thinks they're together forever, and when they're looking after the egg the original partner comes back and the male couple drive off the lady penguin and raise her egg together. 

Also, I bet their feet are.always super cold.

I love how gross their humor gets especially when they are going back and forth with really good friends/relatives  (better entertainment than tv).

And while I find it extremely juvenile and idiotic, their lack of giving a fuck about consequences when performing stunts makes for great tv. Oh, and strength and muscles is always a plus. "

Crazy how people can say things like that without taking just a second to think it through and realize they might be a little bit biased."
"This happened to me once, I slept with a friend casually not knowing he had a girlfriend. A couple months later, still not knowing he had a girlfriend, I was at a bar with a bunch of people for an event, and started talking to this awesome girl outside. The guy I slept with comes over to say hey, talks me to the girl, kisses her then leaves. Awkward. I ask how long they've been together, she tells me about 6 years.

I didn't know what to do, and I didn't want to start anything, but I also couldn't just not tell her, especially because she was so kind! Well, I told her. She replied ""Oh yeah, I know, it's cool!"". They were in an open relationship. Big sigh of relief. She was really happy I told her though, I guess most of the other women pretend nothing happened, even though she always knows, because they tell each other everything.

This was about 7 years ago and we're all still friends. They're married now and are no longer doing the open relationship thing. "

"This site is not particularly friendly to women. While she may not find herself harassed, the hostility towards the female persuasion can be overbearing unless you carefully curate the subs you visit. If she makes an account, I would advise immediately culling all default subs and re-populating her sub list with smaller communities centered on specific interests. Even then, she should avoid any threads or conversational topics that drift toward the female sex. Yes, even news articles featuring women. This is what I do, because I could hardly take it anymore but also didn't want to leave because there is no social website designed to actually work like Reddit (fuck Tumblr and its dumbass design).

Also, tell her to remind herself that there is a huge population of teenage boys here. That's how I remind myself that Reddit is not an accurate representation of men, because good God."
"No, your task is not to order whatever will make this bartender's life easier. They accepted their job knowing that some drinks will take a little more time than others. You should order whatever the Hell you want. If it's busier, you may feel like tipping an extra dollar or so, but it's not necessary.


Some people have too much empathy for the bartender to order anything complicated. Sometimes these people have been bartenders or servers of some sort themselves and had certain opinions on people who made them do more than the bare minimum. That's nice of them, but it's also their personal decisions and you should not feel pressured to do the same.

Bartenders should appreciate people who go out of their way to make their job easier, but in my opinion thinking less of patrons simply asking them to do their job is petty, so if they like you less that's just them being unprofessional and you shouldn't care.

There are plenty of people just asking them to open and hand them a beer, so the complicated drinks should balance out."

I moved away from dairy country 8 years ago and I have had only an endless stream of disappointing cheese curds.  My husband even is starting to think that I am making up the squeak factor to cheese curds because I get so upset over this.  WHAT IS EVEN THE POINT OF CHEESE CURDS IF THEY DO NOT SQUEAK IN MY MOUTH LIKE I AM GNAWING ON A GIGGLING ANGEL.

It's happened in my presence twice in the last week (I wasn't the person who farted either time) but seriously, why point it out?

"Uhg, male here. I work in 90% male workplace, and there is this cute girl who works as a barista there and I swea every day I see the same handful of dudes there for 30-45 minutes trying to chat with her.

It's like guys, she's here so she do things like pay rent and buy stuff like she likes, not get be mercilessly hit on. She has a serious boyfriend too, but these dudes don't care."
We're required to look good and also to make looking good look easy. Having to try wrecks the illusion that women are perfect and fresh-smelling from birth. Nobody wants to know you're secretly a person.

"I just remember there was a scene where Bob says something he wants on his tombstone and Linda is like ""nah, I already got your tombstone picked out"" and Bob asks ""what's is it?"" ""it says 'Order up!'"" and Bob just laughs and says ""You're right that's better"". And I just thought that was the cutest, most realistic portrayal of a normal happy marriage I have ever seen. "
"I think that that's a great way to be.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of dudes (and some women too) take it farther than that.  Where given multiple above the baseline, if given a choice, will always choose the hottest one, rather than the best all around partner who is attractive enough.

Like, I've been in social groups where there are 5 women and 20 men and all the dudes have a huge crush on the hottest chick, and completely ignore the others.  "
"Some men really dislike women and seem to bend over backwards to separate themselves from women in every way possible. Looking at the counter-thread at askmen shows this. Some men seem to think women are this collective blob of (almost always terrible and inferior) qualities without realizing there are more similarities than differences. A lot of those particular men seem to try really hard to take any opportunity to put women ""in their place"" and use their sex as a prop to lord over others. They see relationships (both romantic as well as platonic) between the sexes as battles, not partnerships.

Really brings me down."
"Oh god. Do you know how often I hear 'She is so hot' because she's wearing a lot of make up and has filtered the crap outta herself. Then a few weeks later 'Oh my God, she puts so much make up on and takes so many selfies'. Dude, that's the reason you were attracted to her in the first place."

"[While dealing with anxiety]

"I wouldn't lump the reddit mentality with the ""men mentality"" because reddit has skewed demographics towards immature little boys with no real life experience.

The vast majority of redditors are socially awkward teens/college aged lads who spend their time on the internet because they have no social life. Not exactly the most emotionally mature bunch.

No social life = no social experience, they come here and read sexist things from bitter men who have also never had experience with women and think that the problem is with women, not with them. 

They start to truly believe blatantly fabricated stories like the ones on the red pill and then start making up their own lies to spew on that subreddit to try to fit in and to make it seem like they aren't the losers that they are IRL. 

Thus the cycle continues."
"I've noticed that on the whole men are pretty good at trying to be inclusive. If there's a ragtag group of some sort (a college class project, a networking event, a small office department, etc...) and someone is hanging back for some reason a majority of dudes in that group are likely to reach out and be like ""hey, come join us!"" "
"Before living with me, my husband didn't realize that every woman on TV was wearing a ton of makeup. Commercial for sleeping meds? Ton of makeup. Commercial for athletic shoes? Ton of makeup. There are no natural faces on TV. He'd never really thought about the impossible standard that he had been told his whole life was perfectly normal until we went to the gym together or he woke up next to the shebeast that is me on a Sunday morning."
"I'm usually not that strict and fussy about what a guys place is like. A guy living alone is going to want a little bit of playtime so I'm not going to run away if he owns a giant gumball machine and has a massive games and comics collection....Okay I just really want to walk into a place like that one day. But yeah as long as it's clean and doesn't smell weird it's fine. A clean bathroom and sheets that smell freshly washed would probably make sure I don't decline staying over for the night. 

My personal worst experience was going home with a guy for coffee and finding a mouldy french fry by the sofa that looked like it'd been there for weeks. There were also clothes and dishes all over the kitchen. "
"&gt; “Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

&gt; ""Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)” "
"Prefacing this with the fact that I'm a grown-ass woman visiting home for a few weeks. Last night, I fell asleep in my bedroom with the windows closed.

He's 57, I'm 27, and he still takes care of me every way he knows how. "

I haven't met many men who felt like running away for their life when they saw a cockroach and I just don't understand that. What else does one run away from?
"I doubt this is *really* true and is probably just my experience, but IME many of the men I have met are childish compared with women their same age. Not in the good way of being playful, but of being incapable of the kinds of things women are able to do, probably because women seem to have higher expectations of themselves than men. I've found men to be less independent, less able to sort their own lives out, less able to problem solve, and less able to advance themselves unless it's by neglecting some other part of their life or screwing people over.

I think there is something to the whole ""superwoman"" concept of women being socialised to believe they have to do it all - have their lives in order, have a successful career, but also be a nice and nurturing person and a good friend/partner. We're expected to control ourselves while men are expected to have less self control. 

The relentless pressure women seem to put on themselves as a result does actually seem to put them ahead of men in some ways - we just seem a lot more capable to me than men do. I would certainly have more trust in a woman to do a good job than a man, who I expect will cut corners or slack off, or get overly arrogant and do a shitty job. When I've had bosses, I'll end up doing the work of a male boss who is frankly incompetent and just a blowhard who's trying to ""charm"" or ""power"" his way to the top. When I've had female bosses, they have been diligent and respectful and as a result I respect them more. I'm not cringing over their stupid decisions or fixing their mistakes; I will allow them to take the lead because I genuinely believe they know what they're doing.

This is a massive overgeneralisation, obviously, but I think there might be an inkling of truth to it. It's bad for both genders if true. Women are under constant stress to do it all, while men are given ""men will be men"" or ""boys will be boys"" or ""well you can't expect a man to be able to do it"" excuses by society and that limits them too."

"Isolation.  They do it slowly, not all at once. And typically they are very manipulative about it, even to the point of making you think it was your idea. First it's a guy friend, can't have those. Then it's your girlfriends. Next, even your family. Your parents.  He alienates you to the point where you only need him. That is how he gains control to do whatever he wants. Then you are his. And it's damn hard to leave if you let it go this far. So watch for the early signs and nope out early!  "
"I did. I was aware that it could be a choice, but I never considered not taking his name.

"Too often, men will use women centric things or just referring to them as a girl, to put down other men.

Its really annoying and hard to combat.

One of my brother-in-laws said to my SO, ""Are you wearing your girlfriend's jeans?"" because he was wearing skinny jeans. Being fashionable is girly and because it is, it's a bad thing.

They use insults in that frame often. 

A classmate was talking about a sports star retiring because he wanted to take care of himself cause sports like football  can be so hard on the body. Then another guy says, ""Wow, sounds like a girl"" so apparently taking care of one's body is gender specific (weird) and a bad thing?

Like its really ridiculous. Then these very same people say they aren't sexist. No, that's the very definition of it."

"I asked this question because I realized recently how screwed up my first job was. After my junior year of high school, I nannied for a single dad in his mid 40s who adopted both of his children. His 10 year old daughter was ~~Chinese~~ Korean and his 3 year old son was a domestic adoption. Lovely kids who were largely easy to work with, but the dad was a real piece of work, and at the end of the summer I called it quits. Here are a few quick examples of sexist bs he pulled on both me and the other women in his life:

* His daughter started her period that summer and she wanted me to let her dad know on the day it happened. Called him to let him know; he immediately said ""what am I supposed to do about that?"" and laughed when I outright asked him to pick up pads for her on the way home from work, so I bought this girl her first package of pads (bulk package because her dad's attitude worried me); not sure what her dad did after.

* The son was very clearly autistic. I grew up with an older brother and a younger brother with autism. One night, after the dad got home, I started talking to him about how his son's behaviors were obviously autistic. He kind of laughed it off. Later that summer, the neighbor's 13 year old son said the kid was ""acting autistic."" His dad went and got his son tested then. I decided to ask why he'd acted on the limited knowledge of a 13 year old without autistic siblings instead of mine, and he said ""All you women just worry about everything. I needed to hear it from a man."" What???

* His sister was in town over the fourth of July weekend, and I got to meet her. She was this gorgeous, voluptuous woman with a great head of hair and an infectious laugh; we actually spent a great deal of time together. One night his sister went out to meet up with some old friends, and the dad just shredded her in front of me, calling her fat and crazy and all of these loaded words because apparently big hair and big hips makes a woman a bad person. When he noticed the look on my face, he said, ""Don't worry; I don't see you that way. I bet you're a little hot piece at your school."" Wish I was making that shit up.

* The icing on the cake was when a neighborhood kid clotheslined his daughter while biking by. She ran up to me, wheezing and crying, and after I calmed her down she asked me to call her dad. I told him what happened and his response was ""Big surprise; my daughter is acting like a pussy."" Lo and behold, I quit my job at the end of that week. I'd had enough.

I still worry about those kids from time to time, but I just couldn't deal with that dad anymore. 

Edit: His daughter actually was adopted from Korea. Minor detail but I felt like a jerk for getting it wrong. "
"Reminding you/""confirming"" your flaws. For example, if you are nervous around people, and that person tells you ""hey you were being kinda awkward with x, that's odd..."" "
"You can't get a one way ticket to hell *and back*. You can get a one way ticket there and stay there, you can get a one way ticket there and then a separate one way ticket back, or you can get a goddamn return ticket. "
"During cunnilingus, when it's feeling great I tend to death grip until his face is so squished into my vag he can't breath. "
"And so often, ill-aligned expectations are dismissed as ""crazy."" A friend back home broke up with his GF because she was ""crazy."" The cause of the crazy? Wanting marriage and children. That's not crazy!! In fact, I'd argue that's smack-dab in the middle of 'normal.' You can't date someone for 4 years and then thnk of them as crazy when they want differing things!!"
I mean--I am happy he wasn't cheating but I feel like that would have been useful information for you to know?
Well heaven forfend he be uncomfortable...
"Ok, I don't want this to come off as man bashing. Cause it's not. Most of my favorite people are men and in general many of them can be quite wonderful. That being said, I believe we women have let them have an inflated feeling of self worth for far far too long. We don't need them for food, clothing, shelter, security, etc. Biologically we need them for a couple of minutes for procreation purposes and then send them on their way since the rest is really up to us. I cringe whenever I hear guys saying they expect their women to do this and that to keep them around and women are scrambling around to keep these insignificant jerks in their lives. I just don't get it.

I do enjoy being in a relationship. Often my partner is my best friend so I definitely value them as a human being that's in my life. But there's a reason why men in relationships live longer while the women age faster. I believe Queen Latifah when she said without men there would be a bunch of happy fat women and no crime....obviously not entirely true. But I do hope as women we start to realize our importance and cherish each other more."
Most of y'all can't pull off a beard. Stop that shit.

"My theory on this is that it stems from enforcing masculinity too rigidly from too young an age. Toddlers play as various genders and identities because that's how they figure out the world, then imagine more narrowly from there as they grow up. If from the time a kid can move independently you're telling him that he should NEVER pretend to be a woman because that's wrong, he's going to grow up not knowing how to imagine himself in a woman's situation."
"This drives me *insane.* I don't want to have to  denude myself of body hair from the eyelashes down every fucking day because you've watched too much porn and have forgotten that body hair is a thing on most women. I want to be doing things and living life, not shaving! Ugh."
"Gaslighting, gaslighting, gaslighting - Insisting things did happen that didn't and or didn't happen that did, twisting their words or yours to make it seem like something was said that wasn't, making you doubt or question your own memory, making you doubt your sanity, making you feel you need to apologise for things you were not to blame for or that you shouldn't feel sorry about, telling you that you're being too sensitive when you call them out on something, changing the subject if/when you try to confront them about something, turning things around so it seems like you wronged them when they wronged you, etc.

If you find you're questioning your own memory or judgment, or you're apologising a lot more than you used to - examine why that's started happening, and what has changed in your life to make it so."
"I wouldn't be surprised if part of it has to do with reddit historically being an overwhelmingly male place. Five years ago, [reddit was about 80% male](http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-survey-demographics/). So a lot of the ""culture"" of reddit was built in a context of males interacting pretty much solely with other males, and not being exposed to female perspectives very much. The result is that reddit remains male-oriented due to inertia, so to speak."

"I felt bonded to her right away so I felt like I had a friend with me everywhere I went. I mentally ""talked"" to her all the time.  I felt happy whenever I thought of her.

Also, I work in healthcare, and at the time I worked with a lot of seniors. Pregnancy can be such a universal experience and I would talk with my patients about being married and starting a family.  In a way, I felt connected to generations of women around the world who had been pregnant and borne children.  

Not a popular opinion around here, I know."

"The phrase ""next ___day"" when talking about a day of the week is unnecessarily confusing and should NEVER be used EVER.  It's so frustrating and there are SUCH better ways to explain yourself.  

For example, if today is Tuesday and a co-worker wants to set a meeting, they might say ""Next Thursday"".  Which prompts someone to say ""this Thursday, or next Thursday"". Which prompts the original coworker to give a pointless diatribe about the merits of the phrase and how ""obvious"" their intention is. Also sometimes the phrase ""next next Thursday"" gets used which just adds nonsense on top of nonsense.  

And then at the end of the meeting I'm stuck asking Thursday this week, two days from now? Or Thursday next week, nine days from now?  And they look at me like I'm the crazy person!

It's ridiculous and it HAS to stop. 

A better way is so easy.  Just add ""this week"" or ""next week"" after the week day.  ""Thursday this week""  - I know exactly when that is.  ""Thursday next week"" - I also know exactly when that is.  Thank you for being so clear.  

Zero hyperbole.  This makes me this upset. Omg my coworkers drive me nuts.  "
"I'm the porn kind of loud that gets made fun of quite a bit on Reddit, so probably that.

"That most women don't use makeup or shave ""for themselves/because it's fun"". I believe it's a cultural, conditioned, often sexist, confidence and self-esteem-giving thing and I hardly ever believe when women say they use makeup for ""art"". And that most of the backlash about it being a fun hobby comes out of defensiveness because of men's comments suggesting women wear makeup for them. Makeup use is much more nuanced and rooted in the basis of a appearance-fixer, not art hobby."
"Most people assume you're a guy. But a lot of subs, including the defaults, tend to be pretty misogynistic.

"I think it's endearing that men can care really deeply but sometimes aren't really sure how to express it. My guy friend saw me crying once and got really distressed because I'm not a cryer. He sat down next to me and kind of patted my shoulder and was asking me, ""what do I do next? Tell me what to do and I'll do it."" I looked at him with teary eyes and he asked ""do you want a hug? A milkshake? Just tell me what and I'll try."" It was so random and funny how he would put those two together, but he was genuinely trying to help. 

What I like about my guy friends is that they don't try to fill in the quiet. With my girl friends, if you're upset about something, they try to encourage you to talk it out and make you feel better. They'll even get upset on your behalf as a way to connect with you. When someone close to me died, the girls talked a lot and I felt like they tried to fill in any space with an activity or talking to try to make me feel better or distract me. The guys I know just sat with me and didn't try to fill in the gaps with a lot of chatter, it fulfilled a different need to just have them be close but also give me space. I knew they were open to me talking but I didn't feel like I had to."

When I told him that his doing that hurt my feelings, he told me ""I've tried, but I just don't give a shit.""

Fast fwd a few years and my new boyfriend has very different interests to me, but loves hearing me talk about mine even though they dont directly interest him, because he says my eyes get all sparkly, and I get really animated and excitable and he loves to see that.

"YES. 

If is say I have a preference, I'll get hounded on for being shallow. My guy friends don't get this. If anything their preferences are usually validated. "
"I think this one is underrated because people often think it comes in the form of their boyfriend bluntly saying 'don't talk to your friends/family/whoever etc.'. Don't get me wrong, maybe this does happen, but sometimes it can be extremely sneaky. 

Let me give you an example. In my last relationship, my ex informed me he wanted to move back to Florida. So, I, being a naive child, was like 'okay'. Well, as time went on, plans became more serious and we ended up moving. There's your physical isolation. 

Next, every time I said anything remotely negative about my parents, he would tell me that they don't know what they're talking about and he knows better than them. At first, I thought he was just being an idiot 22 year old, but it started to get real when he told me I had to take his side on things and listen to him because 'we're a team' and 'you're supposed to be my partner'. My mom and I started to get into tons of fights. 

He started doing this with my friends too. He'd tell me he didn't want me to choose, but then he'd call best friend a bitch and say she was just trying to control me. This is called projection, ladies. 

By the end, I was defending him against everyone around me, physically isolated, and unable to get out of the situation without having to beg my way out because I'd gotten in so many arguments over him with the only people that could help me.

I'm out now thanks to my wonderful, loving parents and friends, but man, that shit can sneak up on you. 

PROTIP: If you have to defend your SO to your parents/best friends/basically everyone around you, it is a HUGE red flag and you should listen to the people around you."

"Yes.

I was required to act as the office secretary on top of being a programmer.

So, I and another woman had the same job title as two men, we were all hired at the same time.  The older woman programmer (the only other woman in the company) would make us answer the phones, take all the notes at any meetings, set up things like sending cards for sick coworkers, etc.

The four of us all hired at the same time would hang out together over lunch, etc, and found out that the male new hires weren't required to do that stuff and actually weren't even aware that we were being told TO do it.

I figured I could find better work elsewhere, so I did.  Shortly thereafter, so did the other woman new hire, and one of the men."
"I take my lunch late in the day. I'm actually leaving for lunch right now (2 pm here.) By the time I get back, I've only got 2 hours left, which I mostly spend organizing and making a plan of attack for tomorrow. 

My other tips are make sure you get up and walk around. If you need to print something and there's a communal printer on the other side of the office, sometimes print there, take a stroll, get away from your desk. Also, take an extra long potty break. You don't have to bring your phone in there, but you can certainly contemplate your existence for a couple of minutes."

"How has no one mentioned Cory Matthews and Topanga Lawrence (Boy Meets World)?! I find that show to be somewhat realistic, but their relationship is the most realistic of all. They grow up together, disagree, argue, have special means of communicating (the looks, the silly language) that only couples have, etc. They show a lot of conflicts real couples go through. A lot of the other relationships in the show display properties similar to reality, too (Shawn + his dad, Shawn + Angela, Alan + Amy Matthews). I just love that show."

"I was working a Telefunding job (like telemarketing, except we're just asking for money) and I *hated* it. Training was minimal, so I wasn't great at the job to begin with, but I was not in a place in my life where I was emotionally stable enough to do a job where you basically get yelled at by strangers for 4-6 hours a day. I quit after 6 weeks, for multiple reasons, but I always tell people about my sexist boss. 

He was a total business guy. Like that's stereotype of the middle aged business man who works too much and never sees his kids. He was a little too big for his britches, because this was not a fancy corporate job, but I digress. 

One day, boss pulled me aside and wanted to coach me a little. He wanted to give me some advice on how to do the job better. I'm thinking he's gonna really help me and I'll actually get better at the job, but no such luck. He pulls me aside and starts talking about my phone voice. You know how everyone has a voice they use on the phone? Well he wanted to correct mine. My normal speaking voice is kinda low and raspy, so I raise it up on the phone so it's easier to hear me. This is how this conversation went:

""I'd like for you to try mixing it up with the voice you use on the phone.""

""...Okay, how so?""

""Well, it's a little high.""

""Is that bad? I just figure it's easier to hear if you raise the pitch a little.""

""It would be fine for a job like a secretary or something, but for this, it's not great. We're fundraising here.""

It drove me mad, since everything looked clean until you got close to it, so I just resorted to washing everything before I used it."

"These are the type of guys that expect women's baseline mood to be upbeat and bubbly, the type of guys who have probably told numerous women to smile. So when a woman is anything less than giggly and agreeable, like when she's calm and neutral in general but not agreeable when it comes to a specific topic, they assume that she's below her baseline--She's upset and emotional. 


On the other hand, they see men as having a more neutral baseline mood, because they themselves (like most humans) have a neutral mood until something good or bad happens. So when other men calmly disagree, they see those men as still at their baseline mood--not upset or emotional.


The root of this problem is people who think of feeeeeemales as a different species who operate in totally illogical ways that men will never fully understand. It's the whole ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" book club."

But she was jealous to the point of throwing literal tantrums, throwing bottles at me or him, etc. One time a knife! For some fucking reason they're still together. I moved away and apparently she's a lot more sane these days, but he's still not allowed to contact me. They're engaged and living together. One time I broke up with my boyfriend at the time, so she dumped my ex and then emailed me saying ""he's all yours now.""

"That it's easy.  Yes, dudes are actively asking women for sex more than women are, so if all you want is sex, it is pretty easy to get it, but here's the things that I think people are missing out on:

1) That for any woman who isn't the most attractive person in the room, the men who are asking her for sex are mostly creepy old men, or aggressive scary guys who hit on everybody.  If there are other men in the room who theoretically would say yes to having sex with her if she asked them, she would never know that because they have been ignoring her all night to hit on the hottest chick in the room.

2) There is a non-zero chance that a guy who wants to hook up with you is going to hurt you, kill you, or at the very least get way too clingy with you.  The people who ping that ""stranger danger"" sense who you want to avoid when you're walking by yourself at night are from the same group of people as the ones who regularly hit on you.

3) For the majority of women, there is a huge chance that sex with a partner for the first time is not going to end in an orgasm, and a non-majority but still pretty decent chance that the sex is going to be a flat out unpleasant experience.  Women are hard to get off, and while women can be just as bad at sex as men are, it tends to be more in a ""you're no better than my own hand"" kind of a way than a ""calling you a bitch and slapping you around while giving your dry vagina a rug burn with my penis"" kind of way.

4) The consequences we face from even good casual sex are higher.  Things like pregnancy, or a ""slutty"" reputation, are things that men don't really have to deal with.

So it's like, sure, it's probably easier for women to find some kind of casual sex from some random person than it is for men.  But our cost benefit analysis on casual sex is vastly, vastly different."

"I think a large segment of (mainly white IME) men have a severe lack of empathy for people who are different from them. Like, many I've come across just can't fathom experiences that diverge from their own; I've talked to sooo many who just don't grasp that the experience of being black is so different from being white, that being gay is so different from being straight... they're like 'we all have struggles.' It just doesn't sink in how even the way people LOOK at you when you're a minority &amp; occupy a different place in society is so distinct and causes huge effects over time. 

I think nuance in differing experiences &amp; subtleties of interactions can be very lost with many men. You either act like a 'victim' to them, or you act like a real person. It's black and white."

"My parents are super religious. I wasn't allowed to cut my hair or wear revealing clothing (nothing shorter than knee length, shoulders had to be covered, nothing too fitted). I wasn't allowed to use bad words like 'butt' and 'darn'. I couldn't watch R rated movies, PG 13 was sometimes okay if my parents watched it first and approved it. On the other hand, I was allowed to read almost anything, the exception I can remember is a science textbook that talked about evolution. I couldn't go out with my boyfriend; he had to come and sit in my living room while one of my parents glared at him the whole time. Once I tried to rest my head in my boyfriend's lap and got in trouble because that's how people perform oral sex. My curfew was at least an hour earlier than any of my friends unless it was for a church function, in which case I could stay out all night. I was never allowed to miss church services, so I went at least three times a week, more if they held a meeting. I missed my high school senior orchestra trip as a result. I was also told I couldn't go away to college because there weren't any churches of their denomination near the colleges I wanted to attend. And I was told I couldn't major in any sciences in college because they didn't want me to learn about evolution, or again, possibly move to a state that didn't have one of their churches.

I was really bitter for a really long time, but after I moved out, and since a majority of my extended family is no longer in the church for various reasons, they've mellowed out a lot. But I will absolutely not raise my children the same way."

"Relevant post from someone explaining this:

[–]SgtBrowncoat 1077 points 1 month ago* 

Marriage and Family Therapist here: Morticia and Gomez are probably the healthiest TV couple in the history of television.  They each have their own interests and friends while being devoted as a couple, both have a strong sense of self and are ""complete"" without depending on the other to define who they are.  They encourage their kids to pursue their own interests and are supportive of them when they fail at what they want to achieve without hovering around insisting they are special.  Morticia and Gomez don't shield the kids from consequences, they give them room to fail and learn.

And they are weird; but being weird doesn't mean they are not a healthy couple.

EDIT:  Now that I'm not on my mobile I can flesh this out a bit.

One of the things that I see a great deal of in media and in my clients is the idea that one is not ""complete"" until they are in a relationship.  It's a common trope in narratives as well, this idea that one is only half a person until they find their soul mate or their ideal partner.  From what I have seen, those who go into a long-term committed relationship with this idea tend not to do as well as those who already have a strong sense of self before getting into a relationship.  Morticia and Gomez are great examples of this; they are both very committed to each other while maintaining a strong sense of self.  That means neither ends up ""folding"" to the others' desires on a regular basis, it also means they have the ability to compromise without it hurting their self-image.  A strong sense of self means that they don't define themselves entirely by their relationship, they know who they are as individuals as well as what it means for them to be in a relationship with each other.  They are secure enough in the relationship that the other person can pursue their own interests, hobbies, and friendships without threatening the security of the marriage or the other person.  

One of the problems with TV shows is that they thrive on conflict; it's the nature of entertainment, you can't have a story without some kind of conflict.  The problem is that most TV families end up turning on one another to find that conflict and advance whatever the story of the week happens to be.  In reality, that will tear a relationship apart.  One must change the way one thinks about things.  Instead of trying to ""win"" arguments, realize that having a fight at all is already ""losing"" - the problem is thinking in a me-vs.-you way instead of an us-vs.-The Problem way.  I don't believe that people are problems - behaviors can be problems, but not people.  Blaming and shaming just perpetuate and exacerbate fights.  Now, this isn't to say that conflict is bad, it isn't; conflict is inevitable because two people's needs will eventually contradict each other.  The way conflict is managed is what matters.  In fact, I'm far more worried about the couple who tells me ""we never have conflict"" than I am about the one who says ""We argue too much.""  If a couple has no conflict it means someone is getting steam-rolled and the other person doesn't even know it.

Moticia and Gomez have conflict and they manage to work through it by remembering that the problem is the problem.  They seem to keep in their minds that what is necessary to ""win"" is often to try to find the middle ground, compromise, work out some kind of exchange (i.e. - Why don't we go see the in-laws this weekend and then go camping just the two of us next week?), or find some sort of creative solution.  They do a great job with courtesy, giving each other thanks, being polite to one another, etc.  Gomez and Morticia also praise one another regularly, in fact, if you look at how much they praise one another compared to complaining or criticizing, I would bet it is one of the most positive ratios in all of media (at least for long-term stable relationships).

TL;DR: Most of us could learn a lot about how to be in a relationship by watching *The Addams Family*

I turn around and right behind me there's this archway that leads up some steps or some shit where you can jump from there to the ledge, and the grass leading through the archway is literally a golden carpet of right-ness.

"Some might call it petty that I get agitated when people don't use their turn signals while driving. It's not. It's only ever advantageous. And in some cases could be life saving.

I used to get unreasonably angry when my fast food order was discovered wrong after I get home. 

Social media gives me soooo many annoys most times. I'd probably be a better person if I wasn't so easily occupied. "
Jesus Christ that's heavy. Yeah I would be uncomfortable haha
"Dude here.

Viewing cosmetic usage as ""cheating""

Guys need to do so much less to be presentable and these boys belly ache and scream ""unfair"" about something culture forces on women."
"Yeah. I actually was just thinking about him. I had a friend in high school...he went to a different school and at this point I can't remember how we became friends but we were very, very close. A few times after high school we went on little mini-trips, one across North America, for concerts. I loved our friendship because he held a really strong faith for the Christian religion and I am spiritual but I don't think organized religion is for me and we could have lots of great talks about it but I never felt judged or pressured. He had a few girlfriends while we were friends and he always was so eager for me to meet them. He did have a crush on me at one point but nothing ever happened. I think we held hands once. I often wonder if I downplay his feelings for me and if that's the reason I don't see him. I don't think so. But maybe?
He ended up becoming a youth pastor and he got married. Things got a little odd. He had this fiance and I had never met her and I started wondering if she knew who I was. We never did anything remotely scandalous. We'd like, go to shitty movies or out for sushi, but I wondered why I wasn't meeting her or why she wasn't coming along. He made a comment once about how my ""invitation was in the mail"" and it so clearly wasn't. They got married without me there, which felt so strange because I considered him one of my best friends. Eventually he deleted his Facebook and they moved to a rural community several hours away. Who knows where he is now.

It bums me out sometimes because he truly was a great friend and I miss him. "
"Oh I have a new one!

Sometimes I wish there was an easy way to distinguish between slut-shaming and skank-shaming. 

Like - I don't care how many dicks you've sucked, I just don't think that much sideboob is appropriate for the mall."
"LOL. Sorry to break it to them, but there's a difference between a machine fucking someone because it's programmed to, and a woman fucking someone because she wants to."
"I've been that husband. The trick for dealing with my weepy, pregnant wife was mostly to shut my mouth and open my arms."

"A little off topic, but my god, there is nothing that motivates me to go back to school more than listening to the guys I work with talk about female customers decades their junior."
"A lot of women are so *loud*. They're like flocks of geese.
"
"I've noticed that a lot of men are *really* emotionally affected by seeing women crying, and I think that's so sweet."
"You'd be surprised. I've had men tell me ""how hard is it to smile at somebody and make their day?"" when I told them I hate when people tell me to smile."
I moved away from home
"So many things! I loved being pregnant so much both times and want to experience it at least once more.

I felt beautiful. I could stop worrying about my stomach being flat, my tiny boobs filled out and my hair, skin and nails never looked better.

I felt sexy and my libido went way up. No periods, no worries about protection, increased sensitivity and lubrication. It was awesome.

I was pampered and treated so nicely. My husband doted on me, strangers smiled more at me and were generally very kind and respectful. 

I could eat mostly guilt free! 

The movement of the baby was awesome. It was such a unique and awe inspiring experience, to me. At first it was foreign, but also really exciting. Like... Holy crap that's my BABY! Hi baby! I feel you!! You're alive and okay! It always made me smile and it was like a little secret between me and him and a reminder all the time that I was growing a little person who I'd get to meet soon and fall in love with and show the world to. "
"There are a lot more men who are sexist to women, than there are vice versa. (In fact I'd wager there are more women who are sexist to *women*, than sexist to men.)

For example, Ghostbusters. I read an analysis of Internet movie ratings that said: 

&gt;Male users were more likely to rate television shows with a female-heavy audience lower than female users would rate male-centric television lower. Men were tanking the ratings of shows aimed at women.

So even if the user base were exactly a 50/50 split, anti-woman sentiments would prevail. Because there aren't as many women who go out of their way to tank things aimed at men. It's not tit for tat. "
"Or you might have a really hard time getting to orgasm during sex. I did. 

But the orgasms every other night in my sleep were nice. Wish I could have kept those."
...really good at opening stuck jars.
"I don't know why but I can't stand Meredith Grey from Greys Anatomy.  Love the show, can't stand her. I feel like her face shows almost no real emotion. Or she's a bad actress. Am I the only one who thinks this?"
"See: single dudes in Judd Apatow movies. An awkward, antisocial *woman* who still has a house full of toys from her childhood would not be the endearing protagonist -- she would be a one-off joke about crazy ladies."

"Right? Just when it's a at perfect, hot, sexy, grab hold of it length, they cut it."
That's really cool of you to be able to look at both sides like that. 
"I'm not Turkish (Sorry, I guess let me know if my comment doesn't belong here) but my parents are in Turkey right now. They aren't answering texts which I assume is because they are asleep, but I still have this knot in my stomach. 

Edit. My brother called and spoke with our mother. They had, as we assumed, gone to bed before hearing the news of anything happening. All is well for now. "
"That's.... alarming. Dismissing something and chalking it up to mental illness, and calling it delusion? When did that behavior start? If he's lying to you, like you state, please address it swiftly and thoroughly "
"[It would be prohibitively expensive](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/06/05/booming-market-breast-milk-335151.html), and selling it in grocery stores could actually make it less available for the people who need it. Better to provide it through hospitals and pharmacies, where it can be covered by insurance."
"You have no idea how many men think I owe them some sort of sexual/romantic attention because I had to be nice to them at my job. It happens at least once every couple days, almost always with men who are 2x older than me or more. "
"&gt; Reddit scares me because I wonder if some of them secretly think that way about me. 

So much this. The guys I'm friends with I would say aren't sexist, but like.. How do you really know?"
"Ahh, the ""cool girl"".

&gt;“Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

&gt;Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)”

"I learned a long time ago to never date a man who called his ex crazy. Most likely he was the reason she was crazy. I've had lots of crazy ex-boyfriends too and when I say they did something that someone labels a ""crazy girl"" did, they usually comment that he must have really cared about me or he was just a little jealous. "
When a friend gets jealous you are hanging out solo with another friend. 
"Genuine Gratitude. I have come across maybe about 8-10 men in the world who genuinely display gratitude in both their professional AND personal lives. I think there are certain and few men who truly look for and recognize the moments when something has been done for them, by someone else. 

It's nice and all when they are nice towards clients and business partners - but I've really noticed that in business and personal settings - women tend to thank others much more for both little and big things. "
"Just to underline, you mean labia, not vagina. The vagina is an internal organ, and would have to fall out of my *body* in a horrifically traumatic event before it could fall out of my underwear.

And of course we can feel it. How would one not feel it? Have you ever worn briefs and had your balls slip out without you noticing?"
"lol, ""feminism is a cancer"" up until the bill arrives on the first date. then its ""i'm not an atm."" hmmm...maybe you need to get with one of those ""legbeards"" who agree with you?"
I left a job because they made it very clear that they wouldn't promote me because I'm a woman despite being completely qualified for the job.
Gin and tonic! Or any sort of gin cocktail that catches my eye in quieter bars. It's always gin o'clock! :)

"The hypocrisy when it comes to this is stunning, quite honestly. It's like, they freak out over someone having 20+ partners but are thirsty as all hell at the same time. If you know 20+ women that you'd have sex with, you have no room to fucking judge. Just because they haven't slept with that many people doesn't mean they wouldn't, given the chance."
"I especially felt bad for the daughter. The dad was really good with her younger brother and with other small kids, but she was extremely intelligent and a bit anxious and it seemed like she'd essentially fallen out of her dad's good graces by growing older and having both of those traits. 

Basically, after a while it was no small wonder to me that he'd never gotten married and never really had a long-term relationship."
"Hang out on a Sunday if I've already hung out with friends on Saturday. Seriously. My mom didn't want me to have ""too much fun."" Her words.

Date.

Have friends of the opposite gender.

"I feel very strongly about the Oxford comma, because I was tricked by a menu just last week. The dish was a breakfast scramble with: farm fresh eggs, tempeh or jackfruit, veggies, etc, your choice of bread. So, I ordered it with tempeh. I got no eggs, because that stupid list should have been written: Farm fresh eggs, tempeh, or jackfruit. Veggies, etc, your choice of bread."
"i lived in brooklyn near a middle school when i was about 25. one day, i was walking home from the train, and as i passed the basketball courts, a young man who could not have been a day over 15 yelled at me, ""yo bitch! i ain't had a white girl in a minute."" i stopped, thought, then wrote a made up number on a piece of paper. i walked over to him and his friends, and i handed him the fake number. ""call me if you ever need a babysitter.""

honestly one of my prouder moments. his friends got a kick out of it too."
"I feel pretty average looking, and was conventionally unattractive until Gwendoline Christie became Brienne of Tarth and I could start referencing her in places where my appearance matters. (I'm a BIG lady, like Brienne, and not as pretty as Christie). It intimidates the fuck out of people. I get told I look like a Viking/Amazon/warrior queen a lot.

I am just different looking enough and just ""don't fuck with me"" looking enough that I'm socially invisible. I have to make the first move 100% of the time in every single social setting, and it really eroded my self confidence. I felt like a pest. But you know what? Now that I'm in my mid-20s i LOVE being invisible. I am unafraid to travel alone, go to bars alone, go out alone (reasonably safe of course), but I never have to worry about attention that makes me uncomfortable. I have the freedom to approach anyone who interests me, and I have the social skills to  navigate those interactions in a way that makes neither of us uncomfortable or imposed upon.

All I used to hate my appearance, but now I love it. People don't give a shit what I look like, they care about how I make them feel. I know how good it feels when someone approaches me and is interested in ME, my appearance, my personality. My professional success, social life, and self confidence have skyrocketed by simply changing my role from being the invisible girl to become the selectively invisible girl: only there when the time is right for a conversation and then gone again. 

I just love to give everyone a feeling I receive so rarely: attention."
"I think Molly is definitely one of the most underrated characters in the series. Apart from ""not my daughter,"" she's not one of the ""cool"" adults, but her love and support is so important and just because she mostly does domestic-type spells doesn't mean she's not clearly damn good at magic."
"In heterosexual relationships, men place greater importance on looks than women do when looking for a partner. 

I think this is a popular opinion in the real world, but an unpopular opinion on Reddit/the internet. "
"I was raised by somebody like this. Now, in all my other relationships, this is the quickest way to a permaban. Works for me, though it took a decent amount of therapy to change my own evaluation of my behavior from ""has unreasonably high standards"" to ""has healthy boundaries."""
"I would say /r/abrathatfits but since I gave up and just wear bralettes now, all it's done is made it really frustrating every time people talk about my cup size as if it's huge.

/r/makeupaddiction taught me about blending and contour which is pretty important for round-faced me. 

/r/askwomen has given me a lot of comment karma which makes me feel as if people like me, so there's that. "
"Long hair.

I get it, long hair enhances beauty, you win.

But it really, really, *really* is much harder to achieve and maintain than some men think.

Any man who doesn't believe me is free to eat his words with me at the hairdresser."
I know so many men who would look amazing if they got a nice haircut and put a little effort into picking out clothes.
Wall-to-wall carpeting is a barbaric invention.  I don't know if this is lightening things up as I get mad just thinking about it.  
"I shaved my arms for years bc of this.

About a year ago I stopped.

There aren't words in the English language to describe the pleasure of the wind rustling my arm hair softly.  It's nice.

Plus I instantly feel bugs land on me and can swat them away.  Worth it."
"This is a big one, a former boyfriend once lost his shit when I didn't pick up the phone because I was in the shower. He was convinced I was cheating on him and would not let it go. He felt I had to be 100% available to him at all times and if I wasn't it meant I was cheating.

Big surprise, he was cheating on me with multiple women!"
"Truth 

Traditional femininity = good. Because what I find physically appealing should be the most important thing to women.

Traditional masculinity = bad. Because it's not fair that I should have to meet unrealistic standards and women who expect me too, are shallow bitches who clearly aren't as enlightened as my precious self. "
"I don't find Ryan Gosling physically attractive at all in anything (including The Notebook, Crazy Stupid Love, all those other movies that women usually fawn over). 

Charming, yes. Cool, sure. I respect that he's an attractive person and a charismatic actor, but I've always thought he had a really creepy face. Like if you slapped a mustache on him, it would scream ""Molester""."
"My dad does. My mum has historically had to take care of cockroaches. With time, having to survive when she wasn't in the house, he developed the strength to throw shaving foam at them from a distance and leaving it there burried in foam until she returned."
"Yes. ""Messy"" and ""dirty"" are very different things. "
I had a roommate who kept putting cups in the dishwasher right side up so they would fill with nasty dishwasher water and then they'd have to be cleaned again.  
"NO TWO SPACES AFTER A PERIOD. NO, NO, *ABSOLUTELY NOT.* 

This was a practice that started when people used typewriters where each character, including punctuation, was on a block of equal width. ([It's called monospaced font.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font)) With everything being so uniform in size, it did indeed make it harder to create visual demarkation between sentences, so it served a useful purpose.

But now, with computers and word processors and [proportional fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface#Proportional_font), the need for two spaces is gone. Instead, the two spaces just everything look disjointed - *most especially* when justified-aligning your document. Just because it's ""how you learned to type"" doesn't justify doing something completely outdated and unnecessary. If you tried for about a week to retrain yourself, you absolutely could - and going forward, anything you type will look so much better.

And along that same vein...

YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT A NUMERAL IN PARENTHESIS AFTER YOU WRITE OUT A NUMBER.

This is something you see really commonly in legal writing. (I work at a law firm.) Something to the effect of ""Complainant alleged that he was required to work twenty-three (23) extra hours without pay."" This, like the other thing I complained about, *used* to have a purpose. Back before even typewriters existed, when everything was handwritten, that tactic was used to make sure there was no question based on vague handwriting what the number actually was. (Sometimes people's poorly-written 2s look like 7s or something.)

But now that these things are typed, it's completely unnecessary - and every time you read over those sentences, you read the number twice. And when you see contracts or documents that have such numbers in basically ever sentence, it can make reading those documents a very disjointed and inefficient experience.

And then, just generally...

PUT SOME GOD DAMNED THOUGHT INTO MAKING THE DOCUMENTS, SPREADSHEETS, POWERPOINTS, OR WHATEVER YOU MAKE ACTUALLY LOOK DECENT AND EASY TO READ.

Putting just a little bit of thought into making things look neat and well-spaced, and designed to help the reader follow and consume the content easily, will go quite a long way. A spreadsheet isn't helpful if it's so visually cluttered and lacking in contrast or demarcation that it takes you five minutes to find the piece of data you need. A PowerPoint won't help your presentation at all if every slide is just a floor-to-ceiling size 18 wall of text.

Think of it this way. There's a reason you're expected to dress up (or, at minimum, look neat and put-together even in casual clothes for those more laid-back environments) for job interviews or presentations to clients. While dressing nicely may not directly make you a better accountant, secretary, retail shop clerk, etc., it does say something *about* you. It gives the impression, essentially, that you've got your shit together. Likewise, it may seem like a waste of time to care about how your document *looks* when the content is all there, but a good *looking* document will speak subconscious volumes to the reader about how you know what you're doing.

You don't have to get a degree in graphic design. Just take a step back and try to look at your documents through a reader's eyes to see how easily they'll be able to absorb the content through the visual jumble."
