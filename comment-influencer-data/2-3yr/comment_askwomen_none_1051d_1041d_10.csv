"That all the stuff that happens to me and tons of other women doesn't really happen. 

Edit: Got a ""it is all in your head"" in this very thread. I think someone missed the point. "
"Oh come on, nobody actually says your experiences aren't real.  "
He could have proposed with a ring out of a Cracker Jack box and I would have given him the same answer - absolutely yes.
I've often heard that men will absolutely have sex with any and all of their female friends if given the chance. I've definitely been turned down by male friends and I know many women who have been too. 
"i have never been to prison but my mother has. she served a month in a small prison for something related to a bad traffic accident a few years ago. my mom is not someone you'd assume spent some time behind bars - at the time, she was still a practicing nurse and they let her continue to work while she was in jail via some kind of work release program. on the days she was scheduled, she'd get up 3 hours before her clock in time, go through an exit security check, drive the hour it took to get home, shower and change quickly into scrubs, then drive over to the hospital to clock in. it was based on an honors system and she was able to do this the entire time she was in prison.     
     
she said that the whole building was really cold. the cells, the bathrooms, the common areas - all freezing, no matter if the temperature outside was 75+ (it was early fall in a warm state). she's a very nonthreatening person, so she got along with most of the other inmates fine. she kept to herself and read a lot, but the other women were curious about her and when they found out she was a nurse, they started to turn to her for various ailments in their families.      
     
she said that's something she didn't expect but will always stick with her. most of the women in there were convicted of nonviolent crimes (like drug or people smuggling) because they were from extremely low income families who were trying to make it to america. most of these women did not have a doctor, nor did their kids or families, because of how poor they were, so they utilized my mom's knowledge to try to get some answers about things going wrong. my mom said she talked on the phone with other people's family members quite often, giving them advice on how to treat anything from severe constipation to chronic ear infections to pregnancy issues because they couldn't afford to see a doctor. eventually she got the name of a clinic not too far from the prison that saw patients based on a sliding scale and also found out the name of a bus system that went out to that area twice a week and gave it to the inmates so that their families could have access to real healthcare.     
      
prison changed my mom forever, but not in ways you'd expect. she didn't come out extra hardened and tough like they show in movies or tv, but she definitely appreciates the simpler kind of life now and has developed agoraphobia. she prefers to be alone and lives in the middle of nowhere. "
Give me a massage every night before I go to bed
"Google gave me a list of at least 100. A couple of my go-to questions are:

1. Can you describe a typical work day here, for the position I'm interviewing for?

2. What opportunities for advancement are there?

3. What is the office dress code? 

4. What is the company culture like? 

5. What do you like most about working here? 

I also try to research the company and position beforehand and ask for clarification on anything there I don't grasp or would like more information about. "
People should not use substances until their brains have fully developed. 
"I honestly don't know how people get married before living together, it just seems like asking for trouble. 

I feel like living with someone, you get to know who they are more intimately much quicker. 
Before you commit to a life together you'd probably want to know whether your SO is a spender/saver, tidy/messy, prefers to leave things to the last minute or works to a schedule. Even things like whether you leave dirty dishes in the sink or wash them up straight away can become a point of frustration and arguments, and it takes time to work out what you can live with and not. 
A lot of things are easy to hide, or just not that bothersome when you don't have to live with them, but can quickly turn out to be a big obstacle once you live in close quarters with each other.

I lived with my now husband before we got married, but that's also pretty much the done thing where I'm from. To marry someone you hadn't previously co-habited with would very much raise eyebrows there.

"""You have equal rights already. Now you just want the upper hand.""

""Dating is so much easier. I wish I had a vagina and people would just chase me!""

""You're only voting for Hillary because she's a woman.""

""Let me tell you a fact: All of your guy friends want to fuck you."""
"My boyfriend pointed out he had never met my best friend (since kindergarten) even though we'd been dating 1.5 years and she lives 15 minutes away. Her and I would text or talk daily, but never saw each other. I brushed it off because she was married with a kid. But 1.5 years and we live so close!? I finally wrote her a heartfelt email about it.  She responded with a few sentences saying she didn't have time for this right now &amp; I never heard from her again. It was the worst breakup I've ever gone through and I miss her so incredibly bad. A year or so later my mom ran into her and found out she was going through a divorce so I reached out to her with my condolences, she responded politely, but no communication since. :("
"I kept hearing that I would ""understand when I grew up"" and that ""omg parents are sooooo smart once you're adult enough to realize why. It made me second guess my own mind and perception of the world. 

If an adult woman was beaten and bruised, waited a week, then calmly gathered her birth certificate, social security card, and the $6ish in coins she found around the house to make a fresh go at life, wouldn't that be impressive? Wouldn't she be strong and independent? Wouldn't we all cheer her on?

But if a nine year old girl does it, she's very bad, knows nothing, gets beaten and punished again, is reminded that ""you're the adult and I'm the child"". 

I'm 31 and just now realizing what an awesome kid I truly was, and that there was nothing at all wrong with my perceptions or my actions. I'm the same age my mom was when I got caught running away and I have not magically realized she was right all along. 

I wish there was some way to tell all kids they're smarter than they think, and they might not be wrong just because they're powerless. "
"Oh yesssss this one annoys me.

It's kind of sad when you realize that many of these men only think about ""women"" in terms of ""attractive women"". As if any unattractive women in their lives are irrelevant."
"I'd like my conscious mind to be able to communicate directly with unconscious drives in the body. Like, ""hey immune system, I know there's pollen in the air, and you have clearly identified that as a potentially lethal situation, but actually 100% of the damage being done to me right now is from you, so kindly cut that shit out!"" Or, ""hey stomach, I hear you begging for more food, but we literally just ate a perfectly filling meal an hour ago, so can you just like quiet down for a few more hours so that we don't have to end up starring in an episode of My 600 Pound Life?"""
"My father says, ""Women play at sex to get love and men play at love to get sex.""

So, women don't want sex, and men don't feel love.  How nice."
"By the toilet. Kudos to you for considering this, by the way. As a lady, I very much appreciate it. 

Also remember to put a bin liner/plastic bag inside the bin. "
"I have bipolar and PTSD. I was nonfucntioning for most of my late teens and early 20s. My mother once told me that I should have a baby and that it would ""reset"" my schedule and that it would ""make everything better.""

Worst advice ever.

And no, I did not follow it."
"I'm sick of hearing a lot of men talk about make-up as if their opinions matter to women. I don't wear make up for you, guys. I'm not *lying to you* by putting mascara on my weird blonde eyelashes. I run errands with none on some days, other days I feel like putting on concealer and eyeliner, and some days I feel like having bright pink lips. Get over it!!!!

Edit: also, the insistence of saying ""you look better with no make up"" - please just shut up"
"Along with everything else that was said here, I hate ""you're not like other girls"". Unfortunately, I think there are a lot of guys out there who sincerely believe it's a sweet compliment. It comes with all kinds of nasty implications and stereotypes about women as a whole, so when I hear it, it makes me think that that particular man who said it doesn't have a positive view of women in general."
"Roller Coaster Tycoon, definitely. I liked making people fall to their deaths.

Besides, an amusement park is waaaay more fun to visit."
"I didn't mind friends doing it, but I had a couple of complete strangers try it. I countered by putting my hand on THEIR belly and stared them straight in the eye. They apologized."
"I found my biological father and he wants contact and wants me in his life. I want to tell everyone. I want to splatter it on social media like wall paint. 

Unfortunately, I can't tell my mother as she would cope poorly with it which means I can't tell anyone else because it would get back to her. So now I sit tight with my secret. But he wants me in his life you guys. *Everyone was wrong*.

There are a lot of fucked up people in the world that I had no idea existed before coming to Reddit and a lot of very socially maladjusted people who need help and are not getting it.
"The moon.  While I could save for and eventually go on a Europe trip by myself, the moon trip is either impossible to do (no one is going there) or impossible to afford for me.  Also, it would be really cool to look at the earth, observe low gravity, and so on."
"&gt;What is the female perception of these restaurants?  

I think the concept is pretty gross.

&gt;Have you ever eaten or worked there?

I ate at a tilted kilt.  Never again.

 &gt;How do you feel about the women who work there?  

You do you.

&gt;What about the men who eat there? 

You do you.  I'm not going.

&gt;Do you think working there would be demeaning or empowering?

Neither.  Its just a job, not a POWERFUL STATEMENT ON WOMENING."
"I'm in Arizona and went to the infamous tent city for 24 hours for a DUI when I was 20. (SO COMPLETELY STUPID, I know.  I haven't driven drunk since. Definitely learned my lesson.) I went through cycles of being totally bored, creeped out, and scared that they were going to forget about me. 

I surrendered myself and they took me and all the other people into a room and lined us up for mug shots.  They put me in a holding cell with like 10 other girls. We entertained ourselves by playing Never Have I Ever and counting bricks in the wall. We'd form a human wall whenever someone had to pee so that they wouldn't be embarrassed to go in front of everyone. 

The guards were absurdly rude, talking shit to us the entire time.  It felt unnecessary but whatever. 

With the timing of my surrender, I ended up being the only girl to be transported with about 20 other guys throughout the night. The guards did really well with keeping me separated.  The scariest part of the night was being put in the back of a van with three cages. I was in one cage while a bunch of male inmates were in the other two.  One guy stared me down the entire time, grunting and saying disgusting things to me.  I closed my eyes and ignored him. 

I didn't get to the tents until about 3am.  They gave me a pat down while guys whistled and yelled in the distance. None of my bunk mates were scary, just other women like me who made a mistake. It was so hot and the bed was uncomfortable.  I think I got maybe one hour of sleep. Guys kept sticking their dicks through the fence and yelling to get our attention. 

A guard called my name around 8am and had me walk back to the jail with a group of guys. One guy asked me how my night was, then a guard turned around and said something like, ""how romantic! You can tell your kids you met in jail!"" We didn't talk anymore after that. 

They put me in a holding cell for 6 hours while they did my exit paperwork or whatever it was they had to do, then let me go.  My mom was waiting in the parking lot with a sandwich and a gallon of ice cold water. Tent city in June is no joke, I was severely dehydrated. 

And it's true, everything there is pink. Handcuffs, underwear, everything.  I guess it's to humiliate the male inmates, I don't know. And the meat was green. So disgusting. "
"I'm tired of hearing people say dating is easier for women. No, it's actually not any easier. Not every woman is attractive. Unattractive and average women exist, too. "
"Late term abortions.  People talk about it like if there aren't strict laws prohibiting them doctors will just kill viable fetuses for fun or something.  That's now how this works.  Abortion, from a medical standpoint, refers to stopping the pregnancy early and has nothing to do with whether or not the fetus is killed in the process.  If the fetus is already dead, or will die as soon as it's born, and the doctor wants to remove the dead tissue it's still an abortion and is still covered under any ban or restriction that might exist.  The only thing these restrictions do is make it so that a woman with a severely deformed fetus has to wait for special approval before she gets the dangerous tissue removed.  Nobody is saving any babies with this nonsense.  Like if you removed all the abortion restrictions doctors would still refuse to perform them if the fetus was viable and the mother was healthy (though they may induce early labor in some circumstances, thereby ending the pregnancy but not killing the fetus).      "
I discourage people under 18 from having sex. If I had kids I'd tell them to wait until they were adults before having sex. (Although I still want them to have comprehensive sex education and access to birth control if they want it.)
Lose weight for me 
"A friend's ex-boyfriend once tried to convince me that every man has masturbated to sexual thoughts of every female relative he has: daughters, mothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, grandmas, etc."
You almost got me there for a second hahaha.
I was told that no man would respect me if I had sex before marriage. If that is the most important thing a man bases his respect for me on then he can shove his foot up his ass. Thankfully turns out that it was a lie and I've never been with anyone who gave a rats ass about how many people I have or havent slept with.
"Comprehensive sex education. All the major health organizations have study after study backing up it's effectiveness, and yet there are still people acting as though abstinence is the only way to go.

It should NOT be an issue because of its evidence based effectiveness. And yet here we are still debating it's relevance to children. Its 100% relevant to children because it is useful information for the REST OF THEIR LIVES, like math or reading, or social skills.

People who act like their teenagers don't know about sex mine as well fill their heads with sand. Hiding from the very real truth that teens are hormonal, of course they are thinking about it. ~~On average dudes begin masturbating at 12 and ladies at 16.~~ I misremembered terribly, and my source was from CQ Research, which is not accessible to me anymore [Google search says ""By age 15, almost 100% of boys and 25% of girls have masturbated to the point of orgasm""] (http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/masturb.htm)

They need to stop freaking pretend that sex is the last thing on their mind."
"The ""I don't hold anything back""/""I'm brutally honest"" crowd always grinds my gears. 99.99999% of the time people use this as an excuse to be an asshole to anyone and everyone they encounter. Yes, being honest is good, but being tactful is better."
"I'd go one step further and say that women are ""more emotional"".  In my experience men and women can be overemotional and completely irrational, but women are often better at being self aware and trying to control their emotions.

Women are taught to question their emotions, men are taught to suppress them.  This leads to a lot of dudes being just as irrational as women without ever realizing it.  "
"I'm still really into this guy that rejected me about a year ago. A lot more than I ought to be by now.

"Not married yet, but I'm very glad we've been cohabiting and I don't think we'd be ready to be married without doing so. He's seen me crying over puppy adverts or broken biscuits, he's seen me the most ill I've been since I was in school, I've gotten used to how his ADHD means he's completely unable to be organised or remember to put things away after he's done. We've been with each other through celebrations and family deaths, through holidays and weeks of total drudgery. We've learned how to handle arguments by talking, without the option to go 'home' and come back tomorrow. We've learned how to give each other space when we are both living in the same room or house. We've been there when as a dating couple we'd want to hide or not talk to each other, and I think we're stronger for it. I'd hate to marry someone without knowing how compatible we were living together, and I can't imagine feeling as secure in my relationship if we didn't live together.

*edited to add*: I think what it boils down to, after having a discussion about this with a friend over lunch, is that if you don't live together you basically only see eachother when you both want - when you're both on your best behaviour, and looking presentable, and feeling in the right mood. I couldn't marry someone if that was the only way I'd known them. If I hadn't seen them when they're miserable, or grumpy, or pissed off, or totally lazy and withdrawn, or just going through a bad period, and vice versa, then how would we know if we actually work well together through the bad times as well as the good."

"Maybe not *advice*, but the older I get the more I realize how poor their *lifestyle* choices are. They really, in no way, ""take care"" of themselves. They don't take care of their house, their bodies, their relationship. They weren't ambitious professionally or academically. They never made an effort to truly better their position in life, or reach their full potential (which is sad, they're very smart people!!!).

I live a lot of my life based on NOT doing the things that they do."

I'm mostly joking. Kind of. I love my clients and they love me. You build up a special, very trusting relationship with the person you let rip out all your pubes once a month. I get all the good gossip.

"As a counterpoint to a lot of these, my dad is a much nicer person with a little drink in him. When I was growing up he didn't drink at all. He's very much a Good Ol Boy type and a big believer in men not being vulnerable or emotional, that sort of stuff. People always found him kind of scary although he was never violent or abusive or anything, he just seemed like someone who could be.

When I was in college he started having the occasional couple of beers or whatever, nothing crazy, and it really would make him relax and let his guard down, laugh more and talk more freely."
"Gosh we get some doozies *here*!

* All men notice every single woman they encounter in public (NO ONE IS THAT PERCEPTIVE ABOUT THEIR ENVIRONMENT YOU GIT).
* All men can't help but objectify women! They are all literally unable to look away from cleavage.
* Men always rate women in their head out of 10 &amp; Men consciously decide whether they want to bang every woman they encounter.

Also I *still* think ""Men can think about literally nothing"" is horseshit.

"That we're more emotional and thus irrational idiots. I know a few guys who act like women make no sense and are driven by feelings instead of logic. Dude I've seen you lose your shit over a sports game on TV, don't come at me like you're fucking Spock."
"For every ""she doesn't put out"" complaint I hear from men, I hear the opposite from women ""he stopped trying."" 

This happened to me about 2 years into marriage. Basically, yes, he stopped trying and I stopped feeling sexy. We both work from home at the time and it became really easy to let it turn into an obligation. Look... if you don't shower that day and your idea of foreplay is patting the bed... really? You expect my vagina to sploosh at that?! No. And then I resented the idea that it was somehow *my fault* that I wasn't turned on by that. Or that I was the nagging sexless wife, which I wasn't at all. In fact, I'm quite stellar at not nagging and can be turned on with even a tinge of effort...

We did rekindle it, with some very upfront discussions. Basically, I need to feel pursued - my sex drive is responsive, so texting me from the bedroom isn't exactly arousing. We BOTH tried harder to pursue and seduce the other... I'm not talking about flowers and candles and shit, I'm talking about the kind of stuff that makes new relationships so intense: talking, flirting, attention to hygiene, foreplay when needed, kissing.... It worked and now we're back to getting each other off about 5-7x/ week. Things ebb and flow and we revisit our discussion when they do.

Basically, it bothers me when men act like ""harhar, frumpy wives don't like to fuck anymore,"" because, IME, there is almost always a reason as to WHY that is the case. And NOTHING is less sexy than complaining about not getting laid, rather than trying to fix it in sexy, helpful, affirming, constructive ways  "
"As a not-so-humble but honest disclaimer, I am fairly conventionally attractive. And I think that beauty privilege does exist. Though I believe that privilege isn’t necessarily an advantage or a good thing, it’s simply that the circumstances of one’s life are such that he or she may not have experienced the same things as another.

 It is, for example, inherently easier for conventionally beautiful people to achieve the standard ideals of beauty, because they already look like that. Growing up, I felt much less pressure to conform to beauty standards because I basically already met them. They also have different treatment and experiences. People pay more attention when a beautiful person enters a room, talks, or does most anything. Men will want to buy beautiful women drinks, people will smile at you, talk to you more, be friendlier in general. People are more open to doing favors for you or helping you with things. It’s easy for a beautiful woman to get a man to help her with almost anything.

I have never been fat shamed, mocked for my appearance, or experienced gross harassment, racism, or poor treatment *because I was not beautiful*. Nobody calls me fat, gross, ugly, or anything like that. I don’t frequently hear the phrase “you would look so much better if…” Though I do hate that phrase with a passion.

The harassment is different, but it is still definitely there. I *have* been assaulted, groped, touched, cat-called, threatened, and made to feel unsafe because, and I quote, “you’re just so beautiful.” People seem to feel a lot more entitled to my body than to my less “conventionally beautiful” friends’ (I think many of my friends are more attractive than me, but I fit the conventional look). For example, I’ve had women in restrooms comment on and *touch* my arms, hair, and back without asking or with any regard to whether the contact is welcome. Men will touch my back, shoulders, hands, and arms if they’re polite, and they’ll touch my butt, legs, stomach, and breasts if they aren’t. People belittle my intelligence, are shocked when they learn what I do for a living, and will generally not give what I say as much credit.

I will, however, adamantly argue that you *do not* have to be beautiful to be attractive. Attractiveness is a result of tons of attributes, only one of which is your physical appearance. I am conventionally good looking, but I am by no means the most attractive person in my friend group. I have many friends who are unconventionally beautiful, or who are not physically attractive but still radiate attraction and likeability. I may be approached more frequently than some of my friends, but they’re always the ones people engage in conversation with immediately. Confidence, charisma, kindness, and friendliness are all more important to a person's overall atteactiveness than looks."
"My parents are not super nice people, and my mother is a textbook narcissist. It took me into my 20's to figure it out. At this point, I'm just glad I escaped when I did.

I don't know what your drive for going to law school is, but unless you have a burning, burning passion - or are really, really smart - it might be worth thinking about something different. Billable hours are really, really un-fun, and making partner is like winning a pie eating contest, where the prize is more pie.

I'm just some random internet stranger, of course, but if you don't like law school enough to do well, I'm going to posit that you might not like the practice that much either.

Just my $.02. My life is in shambles after a decade of pursuing a career that never was a fit, so if I can save someone else the pain, why not.

"Twin peaks is extremely fucked. They put you through ""boob camp"" before opening a new location, and the trainers basically throw you any advice on how to suck money out of lonely old men, or if you're really good, expensive jewelry and boob jobs. They require you to tan and gym before every shift, you get graded every day on how toned you are, and scored on your hair and makeup. Your sections and hours are determined by a weekly summary of your scores. Sometimes they would have all the girls line up and bend over, whoever looked the best got to bartend that day. You will be sent home for not shaving that day or having chipped fingernails. The managers happily call 115 lb girls ""fatasses"" and will weigh you whenever they please. You ARE hired on as a model, not as a waitress, so that they can get away with some of the bullshit... But at this point, it's beyond disrespectful. I have friends that work at others likeTilted Kilt and Hooters and have never heard stories like this, so...yeah. I refuse to step foot into a twin peaks again but I do love me some Hooters wings. "
"Unfortunately yes. Everyone wanted to touch my belly, ask really personal questions about how much weight I gained, how my health is etc. It gets worse when the baby is born.

"Same reason I agree weed is not the magic wonder drug a lot of people seem to think it is. I am all for decriminalizing marijuana, but everyone does not become chill and happy when they smoke it.

It works for some people, others it can make more paranoid and worsen anxiety. I am one of those who does not react well and prefers my ""big pharma"" mood stabilizers, and I have gotten some eye rolls because ""I should give weed a chance, its waaayyy more natural."" 

If it works, great. If not, let it go. "

"I think with me and my oldest friend - we've been friends for two decades - I considered just backing out altogether knowing she *probably* won't contact me herself, but I couldn't do it yet because I'm her maid of honour. 

But the more time I don't see her, the more I enjoy her company when I do see her, so I've just recategorised the friendship a little. We'll always be mates but we just won't be close. I'll see her when I see her and when I do see her I'll probably enjoy it.

The problem with long-term friendships can sometimes just be resentment building up over stuff that happens within that friendship. Sometimes you just need a bit of space to remember why you enjoy their company."
"That women are ""asking for"" sexual advances/harrassment/rape because we...wear dresses/makeup/high heels/other **scandalous** attire.

No. If I was asking you for sex, it would be in the form of ""hey, wanna fuck?"", not in the form of red lipstick."

"I just met a guy who seemed completely reasonable, if a little off, when sober, who turned into a raging homophobic, sexist, and all round horrible person when drunk. He was straight out of red pill and even made fun of someone's lisp multiple times in one night.

Clearly the alcohol let out what he could keep hidden when sober. He hid it so well that my friend (who isn't great at picking up subtleties in people) didn't notice until he was drunk. Even now, she might still think it was a joke. "
"That ""think about nothing"" is just like the ""men don't moan cause we had to be quiet masturbating"" argument you hear just as often. Bullshit, irrelevant, and not exclusive to men. "

Not a fan of diamonds. My engagement/wedding ring is opal and aquamarine in white gold.
my abuser is adored by friends and family and i'm mostly alone because i have no family of my own and had to cut out the friends that take his side. the sun might as well shine out of his fucking ass.
I have an older cousin (he was about mid 30s) who had way too much to drink at my sister's wedding. He started harassing my other cousin (early 20s) about how she's the black sheep of the family and a freak. How everyone in the family just loves him so much and not her. He then started mocking the bartender's accent and saying things like speak English you're in America. It was horrifying and I've never been able to look at him the same.
"I was working at subway. And this guy and his friend came in for about 3 weeks straight. I honestly thought they were gay. Then one day, the friend decided to ask me out for the other guy, while the other guy waited in the car 

""My friend really likes you, and is too afraid to ask you out, you're the only reason we've been eating subway so much"" 

I was about 22 at the time. He was 26. Acting like a 10 year old. I went on the date, because I felt bad and thought eh why not. Turns out we had NOTHING in common and at the end he casually asked when he could take me to dinner next. To which I replied.. ""uh....idk"" and walked away. I felt awful. I was so awkward. Over it. "
"I get to that point at folding.  I sort, I wash, I dry.  I do NOT want to fold."
"Yoga. 

Not only does it strengthen my body, but it also improves my mental health. I find that people at yoga are the kind of people I want to socialise with. Very positive, uplifting people with good mindsets. Some of them are a little too kooky for my liking (believe that naturopathic/holistic treatments will cure select illnesses) but they are all coming from a place of love. 

Edit: I also do as many pushups as I can on a daily basis to build more upper body strength. Two months ago I could barely do 1 pushup. Today, I can do 25. "
"And why was it always about the women's restroom and little girls?  Why was no one up in arms about trans people being in the men's restroom around their young sons?

The whole thing was absolutely stupid.  Who the fuck cares as long as no one is being an asshole and doing something out of the ordinary?"
wtf. wow.

"After having a serious illness for a decade, which included having a catheter coming out of my stomach for a few years, I finally accomplished my goal of being proud of my stomach and I totally have six pack now! I vowed it would happen one day, it took me a few years after they finally removed the tube to do it though. I'm very proud of myself!

And I have no one in my life to tell because my friends and family are very not into fitness and they think it's bad for my health, thinking I'll over exhaust myself or something. WHATEVER."
"My mother is your stereotypical Christian soccer mom, soft spoken, never swears and is afraid to offend anyone.

"The saga of my friend's baby who was dealing with constipation.

I feed the cats and take the dog out.    
Then I go for an hour or so walking.    
When I get home I either weight train or work in the gardens during gardening season.  This is my primary hobby and it's usually between 4-6 hours a day.    
In the winters I do house projects like painting, remodeling- there's always something. I have an indoor greenhouse I spend a lot of time in.      
Then I shower and dress.    
If it was a weight training day I do housework or shop until it is time to make dinner.   
If it was a gardening day I am exhausted and read or putz around the house until time to make dinner.    

I stay home because I worked for 35 years and when it came time to move an elderly MIL into my home this was the deal I made with the husband.   
After *his* mother passed I spent another year caring for my own.    

I guess I am kind of retired- at age 62 I'm eligible to file for social security $$ but holding out for a few more years to drive up the monthly amount.   
So technically unemployed.   

Happy as hell, busy every day, and highly recommend it  :)"
"My mom always implied that she was a strong woman because she just kept carrying on with her life when things got shitty and people gave her crap. 

She told me how strong she was for putting up with my father, and for putting up with us kids. 

Bull. Fucking. Shit. Strength isn't just taking crap, strength is in standing up for yourself. Teaching your daughter's that silence and stoicism are admirable is teaching them to be abused and victimised... thanks mom. 

Asking for help is a sign of strength, of faith in the relationships you have developed. It isn't a sign of weakness, and suffering isn't a sign of strength. "
"I definitely have a homebody as well! A few nights that have been fun:

*Have a ""fancy"" dinner on the floor and watch a movie. I like to buy cheap sushi at the grocery and cheap wine and then we just lay on the floor and watch a rented movie. Maybe not super classy but fun! 
*Make a blanket fort in the living room and bring in a small lamp for the ""fire."" Take turns looking up ghost stories online and telling them. 
*Find a new two player game. Could be a video game or a board game. Minecraft is fun or Agricola. 
*Movie marathon. Load up on snacks and say something crazy like ""Let's watch all the Harry Potters!"" Watch two and then fall asleep lol. 
*Get a two person hammock and watch a movie outside on a tablet. We have a two person hammock hung up on the rails of our very tiny apartment balcony. Bring pillows and blankets! 
*Spa night! This may take some convincing at first but can lead into sexy time! I can't talk my guy into mud masks but he was willing to try making a homemade sugar scrub and testing it out! Light candles and put on relaxing music. Take turns giving full body massages. 

...I promise we are adults lol. "
"Bring me McDonald's when I'm hungover.  

Also, do my taxes. Which I do pay an accountant for, and view as money so, so well spent. "
"I find them sad and depressing. I've mentioned this here before, but most of the men that I know that go to them are in their 30s and 40s and in marriages where the spark has faded but not gone out entirely. They're looking for the illusion that they can still attract a stereotype of young, attractive women without actually cheating on their wives. 

Edit to add: I'm aware that part of the other side of this coin is that while my acquaintances are out doing their wish fulfillment, that their wives are usually stuck doing childcare and not allowed a similar escape. Which is part of the sad aspect of it."
"Plus the whole ""anger isn't an emotion"" thing when it totally is. Socially it's more acceptable for men to be angry, pissed off, etc, and that's not seen as ""emotional"". Of course, a woman gets angry and she's just upset and being irrational. Or a (insert female slur that would be deleted). 

You see it on reddit a lot, people getting so angry about others having ""feels"" and they don't seem to realise their anger is also a feeling. "
That it's impossible for a woman to be unable to get a date.  Because women can get men whenever they want.  Sigh.
"You raise such a good point honestly. I mean, media in general is far more okay with average looking men than average looking women in fiction. People, men and women, probably have a bit of unrealistic expectations about what the average woman looks like."
"For me it was more funny than awkward but for the guy... I was sitting at a park with my ex-boyfriend. He went to get us some lemonade, when I was waiting for him alone this one guy walked up to me and made some small talk, then asked for my number. Right when I was telling him no my boyfriend came back. The guy turned out to be his cousin."
"&gt; Can you describe a typical work day here, for the position I'm interviewing for?

Rephrase this to a typical week. If you say ""typical day"" you often get ""well every day is different"" or something. Broaden it to a week and you're more likely to get the answer you're looking for."
"Women are difficult to understand. 

No. People are difficult to understand if they don't know how to communicate their feelings, thoughts, desires, etc."
"I was driving a long-term friend back to his apt after hanging out one day, and about 5 minutes into a 40 minute drive he asked me out. I said I didn't want to be more than friends, and then we fell into the most uncomfortable silence.

I was thinking about the 35 minutes left in this drive &amp; trying to think of ANYTHING to talk about when he broke the tension with ""in hindsight, I really should have saved that for the *end* of the drive"". We both started cracking up &amp; then moved on."
"My dad was 48 and riddled with cancer. I didn't realise how sick he was because I was a selfish, self absorbed 23 year old. One day he asked me to clean his glasses because he couldn't see properly, so I did. But he still couldn't see, and said something like 'Jesus Christ can you do anything right?' I lost my cool and told him to clean his own fucking glasses, and left the house.

That was probably the last conversation I ever had with him. Turns out there was nothing wrong with his glasses, but the cancer had reached his brain and he couldn't see properly. He died a few days later.

That was 5 years ago and I still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, crying my eyes out with guilt and regret. Fuck 23 year old Beogaire."
"&gt;Do you feel like it made getting married less special

This does not compute. My husband and I stood up before friends and family and promised to be partners until one of us dies. He's super shy and terrified of public speaking, and he declared his undying love for me in front of basically everyone we know. How on earth could anything make that less special? 

We moved in together because it made sense. We were engaged, and it saved us about ten grand to combine households a year and a half early.

I never doubted that I wanted to marry my husband. Moving in together didn't make me feel more confident about it or make my marriage less special. It was a practical monetary decision. "

He's a fucking grown man, he knew what he was doing. "

"The jail system in North Carolina does a weekend option program. It allows people with non-violent short term sentences to keep their jobs.  The goal is to prevent the person from losing everything because of a single mistake. It has worked really well here.  On Friday afternoons the line to check yourself in is around the corner. But it has reduced repeat offenses, reduces the costs of the jail stays, and has reduced the homelessness in the cities.

"Best friends since junior high. I got married and had kids. She remained single and goes out and on vacations all the time. I work a typical 9-5 while she works swing shifts. I would try to make plans but was constantly being stood up, yet it was always *my* fault we never hung out. I never made a big deal about how our schedules conflicted because, well, schedules. I understood 100%, but apparently because I am not able to drop everything and go on a week-long road trip with a half-hour notice meant I was a bad friend.  Eventually I just stopped trying. I was tired of being guilted for having responsibilities. She'll text me once a month or every other month and say things like ""We should get together!"" and I'll say something like ""Absolutely. Wanna stop by *literally any day within the next week*?"" And then she won't respond, for like a month or two. Wash, rinse, repeat."

"As someone who grew up with a fair weather father, I'd be mindful of thinking everyone was wrong.

By all means, reach out and try to build a relationship, but be wary. There's generally a reason(s) people write people off or cut them out. 

I forgave my father and we were able to mend our relationship before he passed, but he was an alcoholic monster and abusive fiend for most of his life. Even after he had moved past all that, it left him an emotinally stunted, selfish and difficult man."

"For me the bigger thing is how the dynamic can change when you see a person *every day*.  Some people have the same expectations of time/attention, while others expect more.  Or how naturally you're going to communicate differently.  And you're more likely to see a person ""at their worst"". "

"In all the happy, lasting, stable marriages I know of, the couple is more similar than different: values, goals, personality, tendencies, hobbies, reactions, interests.

I'd say that if your relationship is a tree, the ""roots and trunk"" need to be the same, but the ""branches and leaves"" can differ, to use a cheesy analogy. Still, I think that the more you have in common the better. Compromise is good in a relationship, yes, but your life shouldn't be one big uphill roll of constantly compromising - IME, that leads to feeling unfulfilled. EX: I'm a long-time vegetarian; if my husband were foodie, I think that would eventually cause a rift and the *only* reason it's not is because, well, he doesn't care about food at all.

I know a couple, that I use as this example in this sub a lot, that has about zilch in common, from hobbies to political leanings to money. A weekend for them means one is always 'compromising' - since they don't like doing the same things, they don't really have mutually agreeable weekends (except Netflix, which isn't really lasting power in a marriage, IMO)

I know exceptions exist and people are quick to note that ""my SO and me differ a lot and we make it work!"" but A- I've never known that to work beyond early years in dating, personally, and B- when it does, it's the exception rather than the rule.... It's true what they say ""birds of a feather flock together."" Sociologically, this is true for things like money/ hobbies/ worldviews - there's a reason that gym-rats don't date chain-smokers, for instance

TL;DR - the more in common, the better; compromise and communication are only good things in relationships on a foundation of compatibility - you cannot ""talk through"" fundamental differences"

But no, guys who say this are usually only picturing attractive women in this scenario, because in their minds, unattractive women don't exist. They just don't see them, or they see them and forget about them immediately because unattractive women have no value to the idiots who say shit like that. "
"Carrying children. I mean this physically. 

Our hips are better for it, and our arms are turned at a slightly different angle naturally.

"For years everyone told me my best friend (a guy) just wanted to fuck me. As it turns out, he's attracted to men and trans. 

But seriously, sometimes people just aren't attracted to certain members of the opposite sex. And sometimes people might be attracted, but don't want to jeopardize their friendship with their friend. "
"My best friend and I moved out together at 18, but a few years later we had some kind of whole falling out and split up. Neither of us can remember what sparked it now, but I think living together was getting on our nerves. 

We didn't talk for over a year. It absolutely broke my heart. Awhile back I found my old Livejournal posts from that time where I was just writing devastated letters to him knowing he'd never read them. Just talking about how much I missed him. 

Anyway, at some point he messaged me on MSN messenger to say hello, it was two days before I left on a solo cross-country road trip. I asked if he wanted to come, he happened to have just quit his job and didn't start his new one for a week, so he came along. 

We had an amazing time, it was like nothing ever happened, and have been best friends and platonic lifemates ever since. (We're 35 now, so this was all like 13-14 years ago). We refer to that one year break as The Unpleasantness and ultimately I think we just needed that time to find ourselves."

Everything from the details of her daughter's latest panic attack to exactly how it's being treated. If anyone -- especially my parents -- shared my personal mental health details *with the whole fucking world* I'd be livid. Especially since it's a giant attempt to garner sympathy for her and how hard it is for *her* that her daughter has anxiety. It's one thing to overshare about your life, but this is your daughter's mental health. WHO DOES THAT? "
"That all men want is sex and that's it. They just want sex.

"It's pretty prevalent on Reddit. Can't say I have conversations about it in real life. 

Generally if there's a question here asking women what they want men to do in bed, there will be a ton of answers from women saying ""make noise"". And then a bunch of dudes will give the masturbation excuse for why they/most men don't. 

It's just bizarre, because do they think teenage girls living at home are just screaming and moaning like porn stars when they're masturbating?"

"Around age 13-15 I spent an absurd amount of time in a Harry Potter themed roleplay chatroom online. I met a girl my age there who lived a couple states away and we decided to become pen pals. When my parents questioned who this person was sending me letters, I knew they would freak out and take away my computer privileges if they found out I gave our address to someone I met online who would TOTALLY DEFINITELY turn out to be a pedophile (spoiler alert: she was exactly who she claimed to be). So I told them that I met her at the church camp they sent me to every summer.

TO THIS DAY (I am now 28) I'm sure my parents still think I met this girl at church camp, because I never told them the truth. We aren't particularly close anymore as she moved to another country but when I was in college I drove to her state to visit her a couple of times, and even attended her wedding. "

"My engagement ring is alexandrite, lab-created.  It is structurally perfect due to its lab creation and changes color depending on the light it is in.  It's the most beautiful piece of jewelry I've ever seen."
One time I was in a bathroom and I heard a girl crying really hard. When I got out she was slumped on the floor sobbing and I felt really bad. So I asked her she needed some water or a hug or something. She took the hug. I went on with my day but I ran into her a few weeks later and she thanked me for being so kind and that it really helped. So I'd probably do that again. 
"I always wanted children, and I still do, but I realize now how much of a commitment that is and the extent to which it will totally fuck up what I now consider to be my normal life. I had a happy childhood thanks to great parents. I had younger siblings. I babysat a lot. I have always loved kids, but now that people around my age have them it has occurred to me that having kids isn't just about incubating and popping out a sweet li'l' baby, it's about all the steps beforehand to prepare for basically a lifetime of focusing all your energy on other human beings who will tell you they hate you and shriek all night and ask you for money and lie to you and disappoint you and hopefully, just hopefully, turn out okay in the end."
Just how stressful it was to have to live in their house.
"Anytime I get told that I'm not like other women, I turn around ask, ""and what is wrong with other women?""

Their response tells me a lot. "
It's not an outright dealbreaker but it does raise questions for me to be honest. It would depend on the circumstances.
"Hey, hey! I just got engaged two weeks ago after four years together. I always knew I didn't want my main stone to be a diamond and I wanted it to be lab created for ethical reasons. I'm also a non-consumerist kinda gal, so I didn't want anything too precisely. So I chose a pink sapphire! I absolutely love it and catch myself staring at it. Here are some pics (excuse the Instagram-y pic): https://imgur.com/a/VqKCY "
"As a woman it's easier for me to have really open emotive conversations with my friends and get sympathy and support. A lot of guys I know tell me that in guy to guy friendships it can be tough to express deep emotions to one another bc of the pressure to be unfeelingly hard and ""masculine"". I have no problems with crying and snorting all over my buddies, and I'm sad that a lot of guys don't have this."

If ever I were dumb-money rich, I'd pay someone to brush/floss my teeth every night. It's just such an unpleasant thing to do, right at the end of the day when I have no energy. "

"Not me but my mom. 

Not really ""served time,"" but she was in holding for 48 hours to see a judge. 

My mom was sort of double parked on a residential street (3 blocks from our house), passed out from low blood sugar (she's a diabetic) and just came home from a weed run. She had about an ounce in her purse on the passenger seat. Cops found her slumped over and sadly had to arrest her while in the hospital when she came too because it's illegal here. 

My dad calls me while I'm at work, trying not to laugh, like ""oh I'm in the precinct by the house getting the car and your mom's stuff. She got arrested about an hour ago.""

He got everything but the weed of course. 

48 hours later my dad calls me again, saying to head home (I was at my boyfriends) because my mom called and said she got released. 

I come up to the hill by my house and see my mom sitting in the car, without a jacket, dogging a subway sandwich. 

We leave $10 in our glove compartment at all times and our trunk is always unlocked (minivan) for emergencies. She hopped over the seats through the trunk and took the money, bought food, and came back. 

She told me that she didn't have anything to eat or drink the whole time in holding just to make sure her sugar was stable. They let her off with the lowest count of possession and it left her record after a year of not getting in trouble again. Especially since she had no intent to sell. She was stocking up for months. 

She was mad she lost $300 worth of weed though. 

She said it's super gross in holding. Everyone is angry and trying to pick fights. But she did get someone's number who does hair who was in the cell with her, and she did my sisters prom look. She looked great. 

We laugh about it to this day. "

"I've only ever encounter this on reddit. The men I see face to face seem to know that men vary.

But most recently on reddit, some guy tried to tell me that any time a guy does something that would increase his testosterone, he'll definitely start to feel aggressive, and that's how he knows aggression and testosterone are linked despite the research I pointed out. ""Ask any guy!"" he said. So I asked my roommate for shits and giggles, who happens to be a guy, and he said, ""Oh yeah, every time I watch an action movie I can't help but start punching people."" Or that's the gist of the stream of mocking that came out of his mouth anyway."
"Great! I'm getting back to where I was a year ago in regular life (having a job, medical benefits, putting money into savings again, all the good things) except without that constant voice in the back of my head that says ""he doesn't love you anymore"". And it's way better without it."

There was a bed and breakfast that looked nice, but had shared this weird passive aggressive post along the lines of ""We were approached by a same sex couple for a wedding... we are CHRISTIAN!!!... we thought about it for a while and decided that we were okay with it.  By the way, to the people we talked to, we didn't give you a mean look...""

And it just went on and on.  I feel like for the sake of their business they could have kept it simple and said ""This weekend we're celebrating Adam and Steve's wedding"" and not gone on and on and on."

"Running, but the reason for that is because I am actually able to keep doing it; other workouts I've lost motivation and quit.

"I've encountered this more than once. My first reaction is to assess the situation. Is she hurt? Wasted? A special infected Witch from Left 4 Dead? I try to determine what might be happening and then act accordingly. 

I was walking to the train station in my way home from class once and there was a lady my age or maybe just a bit older than me leaning against a pole, almost sobbing. Judging by how she was standing, I decided to check in. 

She was injured. She fell off of the steps to the elevated trains and had come down really hard on her ankle. It looked like she had broken it, and from talking to her I learned that her phone (this was before smartphones were everywhere) was dead. She has also only just recently moved here, and wasn't very familiar with the area yet. When she asked a few passers by for help, she had been ignored. Maybe they thought she was panhandling. She was in pain and scared. I knew there was an urgent care facility only a block or two away, so I agreed to help her get there and made sure she was okay on her own before I left. Turns out we went to the same college, too. 

Another time at the train station in my town, there was an older woman crying. Maybe late fifties? She was like... inconsolably sobbing. I offered her a tissue and I sat with her for awhile. She held my hand really tight. A little bit later a younger man got off of the train, and he seemed quite sad, too. She seemed relieved that he was there. I never did find out why she was crying. I didn't push.

Another time I ran into a crying girl who was wasted, and rambling about...well, everything. Did you know that traffic lights can form allegiances? Apparently they were out to get her. When the crosswalk indicator turned green, I noped the fuck out of there. I was not needed there.

There are other similar stories, but I try not to repeat stuff. I am not a cold person, and I never want to be. Even if it's a stranger, I want their happiness and comfort. It's never too much to ask to check in on another human. I'll hold your hand. I'll get you to safety. I'll wait with you until things are settled. I'll listen if you want to tell me. I won't abandon you if you don't. It's always worth it to at least assess the situation. 

There have been a few times where it's been inconvenient for me afterwards. I've even been hurt. Even with the bad results, it's always worth it to stop and observe. Even if I get stabbed (...again), I never want to think that it's okay to leave someone who might be suffering just because it's inconvenient for me."

"Absolutely, at least from my personal experience. When I was very overweight and didn't put much thought into clothing or hair or appearance, the way people treated me differently was apparent in so many ways. Once I lost weight, started wearing makeup and doing my hair, wearing flattering clothing, the difference was night and day. It was everything from store employees approaching me to see if needed help while shopping, being able to flirt my way out of something, more people wanting to be my friend, taking my opinion seriously instead of brushing me off, and more opportunities in the workplace. "
"I had a chat about this with my bf recently.

He mentioned the (I think) Dave Chapelle stand-up thing, about how women dress and ""if I wear the costume of a policeman"", I see it posted on Reddit and Imgur a fair bit and it always bothers me.

So I dug into it, and we had a discussion about it;

Him: ""Well... if you're in a bar and see a girl who's dressed up nicely, chances are she's looking for a guy/girl..""

Me: ""That's absolutely not true at all""

Him: ""Sure it is.""

Me: ""Ok, so because I'm in a relationship with you and definitely not looking for men, when I go out with my girls, I'm supposed to wear what exactly? Tracksuit bottoms?"""
"Someone I started to make friends with when I was in college. We'd hung out a few times and had fun, then one evening we were hanging out in her dorm room when her roommate was out and it was just the two of us.

I still stand by what black lives matter is doing because I understand it. But I think that particular group wasn't getting anything accomplished that day other than looking bad. "

"For me, the advice they directly told me was generally good.  The bad things were more implications that have had a negative impact on me in the long run.

Too many examples to list, but an easy one to pull out is the idea that women don't really like sex and men want it all the time.  My libido is higher than my husband's.  This is still something I struggle with.  I feel like there's something wrong with me (either for my high libido - don't want to pressure him - or for his lower libido - is he not attracted to me?).

I used to be friends with a middle school teacher who was constantly sharing stuff about her students - photos, full names, things they told her in confidence, everything. This might seem mild except that she was sharing private information and images of minors who were *not her kids* without their knowledge/consent OR their parents' knowledge.

I finally lost my interest in maintaining that friendship when she posted a story about how a student had approached her in private and come out to her as transgender - in which she used the student's name. AND one of her other friends responded to that post by saying she should write a book about her experiences teaching.

"This one is kind of shallow but I really dislike the *unprofessional* ways some people present themselves. I know this so stupid but I think rainbow hair (for example) projects an image of immaturity and screams ""Look at me and how 'unique' I am!""

I also really dislike how casual sex and drugs have become, especially in our youth.

"There's a difference between what Reddit thinks the fat acceptance movement is (I'm going to loop HAES in because they're used interchangeably here) and what it actually is. Reddit thinks that it's a celebration of being fat or whatever, but in reality it's about promoting the idea that you are much more as a person than your weight. A lot of fat people have internalized the narrative that they get from society, peers, friends, family, etc that they are somehow worth less because they are fat, and poor mental health like that doesn't help them lose weight. By promoting the fact that they can be attractive, successful, intelligent, etc completely separate from their weight, mental health can be improved and weight loss and other medically healthy practices can be adopted."

"For me personally it’s the gaming communities. I hate playing games online because of how women are treated. The second people find out that you’re a woman you get harassed, it’s infuriating and ruins the games for me. I’d rather play a single player game or a game with my friends where no one will make fun of me for my gender. I don’t play online games at all anymore almost exclusively for this reason. 

Along with the game-specific communities is the whole culture of video games. Frequently, when I mention I like video games, I get all sorts of questions obviously meant to show that I’m just pretending. I get the “oh really? What do you play? What’s your character? How many hours have you logged? What’s your best K/D ratio? What’s the name of the main character’s cousin’s friend you see for 30 seconds in that one obscure scene?” 

The last might be a tad exaggerated, but the spirit is there. Women aren’t allowed to like video games for the sake of liking them the way men are. Nobody gets mad at a man who doesn’t know all the intricate details about games. Like I’m allowed to say I like cake and no one gets all high and mighty about how I can’t *really* like cake because I don’t know how to make red velvet from scratch. But with video games, it feels like I can’t be a casual gamer without being hated on for being a woman. Like shit, can’t I just enjoy playing the games I like without having to justify myself or liking the same ones that other people do?

I don’t know of a specific way to fix this, beyond just encouraging people to not be *those* people who treat other people like shit because they aren’t as dedicated to the same things. Call out your friends when you see them doing this sort of thing; don’t let them make a woman feel dumb because she enjoys Mario Kart and not CoD."

I don't find it empowering either though.

"A lot of the comments are about friendships that ended, so I'll give one about a friendship we were able to save. 

Best friends since 7th grade, but we went to different colleges, about 2 hours away. Saw each other fairly regularly the first few years and then progressively less after that. When we did get together, things felt... off. It would take a while to sort of warm back up. I felt like our lives were in different places - she was in a career she was passionate about and had a long term boyfriend she intended to marry, I was still partying. She would talk about the life they had together, the future they were working towards, and it just didn't really fit with the girl I grew up with. I just figured we'd both changed a lot over the years, and it hurt but that's how life is sometimes.

Then her boyfriend got a new job in my city and they ended up buying a house about a block away from me! I introduced her to my friends, we'd hang out all the time, it was great! But something still felt off. 

Eventually, she confessed all these issues in her relationship with her boyfriend. He was emotionally abusive and she didn't realize the extent and how much it at affected her self-esteem until she started spending more time with my friends. She realized that MY boyfriend treated her better than HER boyfriend did.

I convinced her to leave him and stay with me. For about 2 months she slept on my couch and lived out of laundry baskets, until we were able to get a larger apartment together. A whole group of my friends, now OUR friends, went to her old house while her ex was gone and we loaded everything into a trailer. 

She's now married to my boyfriend's best friend. They live a few hours away so we don't see each other as often as I'd like, but our friendship is so much better. 

The years we spent where it felt off, I think part of it was her trying to subconsciously convince herself that everything was okay. If her ex hadn't gotten that job, I would've just assumed we'd changed and let the friendship fade."

"I've been attracted to men where it hits you like a train. But with my previous partner, I never had that. He's objectively attractive, but I was infinitely more interested in his personality, goals, and ideas. After 3 years together, I eventually just saw him as more of a friend, maybe even like a brother, and I couldn't get over that. 

I learned my lesson though, and for me to want to be with somebody now, I have to want you like a hell cat on bath salts. "

"Guardians of the Galaxy. 

I used to really like Chris Pratt. I loved Andy on Parks and Rec, but now I'm starting to find him really stale and one note. He plays the same character in nearly everything. The ""lovable womanizing rogue""in Guardians, in Jurassic World, and in The Magnificent Seven.

I hate that yet again, the Smurfette Principle is present in an ensemble movie. Basically, in stories with an ensemble cast, there is only one female character. They hyped up Gamora to be this badass space assasin but she was nowhere near as impressive as they made her out to be. Plus, she had to be saved by Starlord twice. Nebula was much more badass. 

The villain was weak as hell and basically a carbon copy of Thor 2's villain, who was also a weak villain himself.

"From a hetero perspective, I actually do think its easier for girls to date than guys, *generally*. I mean, it really depends on the girl. But I feel that guys get different societal pressures than girls do when it comes to dating, is why.

Like, in my experience, I have always been more prone to meet a girl who has never had a boyfriend at 22 and is relaxed about it than I am to meet a guy who feels the same way. 

So, in my life I have run into more young men who were a bit desperate about dating. These kinds of guys will sometimes date basically anyone, which technically gives us girls more to choose from.

Thing is, guys like that tend to be shitty picks for a partner. So I guess Im just saying we have more people available to us. Unfortunately that means we have to weed out more people. 

Im not sure how things are in the LGBT world. I only recently came out of the closet so all my partners have been men and this is just what I have experienced with heterosexual dating. "

Their advice was/is laughable."
Oh god. That guy should never open his mouth.
"Ugh god. I tore this dude apart for saying that to me once.

We had a drunk kiss at a bar, stupidly, I gave him my number. He asked me out on a date, I declined. He rang me to find out why, I told him I wasn't interested.

He got all ""but I've never met a girl like you before, you like nerdy stuff, other girls only like hair and make-up""

a) Just because you've never met 'a girl like me' before, doesn't mean I must immediately date you.

b) I also like doing my hair and make-up, so you've just insulted me and 

c) You just insulted other women, which I don't take kindly to."

There was a dinosaur expansion. I'd play this sort of sandbox mode they had where you get pretty much infinite money and I'd hatch a whole ton of t-rex eggs and then fire the keepers and wait for them to get hungry. Then I'd fence off the park exit and set them free.
"How is that a *result* of feminism? It is exactly why feminism needs to exist.

Men not being able to talk about being suicidal or being beat up by their gf's is because emotions are ""feminine"". And being feminine is ""weak"". If women weren't perceived as weak and lesser than, then it wouldn't be so shameful to be abused by your gf or to be emotionally sensitive. 

Men are hurt by the devaluation of femininity just just as much as women are. This is why they have so much more pressure to be masculine and unfeeling and strong and hetero. It's why we have insults like ""crying like a girl"", ""don't get your panties in a bunch"", ""are you on your period or something?"" And we praise people by saying he's a ""real man"" and ""has balls"". 

Heck we even praise women by saying she ""has balls"", because it's so much better to be a man than a woman.

I thought this was like Feminism 101.

The issue for both genders is that it's shameful to exhibit any qualities associated with women. Hence gender equality is rightly called Feminism. There are plenty of issues particular to men that deserve the spotlight too, but those issues stem from the same male-led society. It's men oppressing men, not because of their gender, but because of some other bullshit. It's a lot different than men oppressing women and femininity *because we are women*.

Also really baffled at how false rape accusations are caused by feminism. It is falsely reported at the same rate as any other crime."
"No. Women cease to exist when they're not around men. How can we masturbate if we don't exist?

"My ex's ""if it isn't an immediate yes then it's a no"" philosophy made me really cross. He read some book I'd like to burn that basically said that your gut reaction to any question or request is the only answer you need.

As a very logical person, I find this philosophy interesting but also kinda stupid. I can see how it applies to stuff like ""do I want to accept this invitation"", but for bigger decisions it's really dumb. For example, my ex asked if I would lend him £10k (to be paid back with interest) for a new car, so I said I'd think about it, but he said that if my answer wasn't an immediate yes, then it was a no, so I shouldn't bother.

When he asked me to marry him I said yes without thinking about it because it felt right. He dumped me 3 weeks later, proving that his philosophy is shit."
"Oh boy. Where do I start?

"The obvious answer is he got very very fat.  But also, he just put no effort into making me feel good and I had to do all the work all the time. And then he'd always come first and I was left to give myself an orgasm, and orgasming became harder. After having a dick in me and then taken out, my fingers just don't do the trick quite as well. When sex is like that every goddamn time, sex becomes less appealing. "
That institutionalized sexism doesn't exist. 
"Oooh, can you tell me, a complete stranger, whether you're planning on having the baby removed by having it yanked from your ripped-open belly or by expelling it forcibly from your vagina?"

I'd be glad to know that BEFORE getting legally bound together lol"

"Not the same story but this reminded me of when my sister had her twins. I was maybe 14 or so and I was kind of chubby. My Mom and I had gone to visit her in the hospital and we took the babies walking around the hallway so that my sister could rest for a bit. I guess because I was chubby, wearing sweats and holding a baby this old woman assumed I had given birth and started glaring at me and making snide comments about being a teen Mom. I wish people would just mind their own business."
"It's not so much that I've given up, I've been through enough relationships and met enough troublesome people that I know my limit. I don't want to spend everyday compromising about something, or letting shit slide that hurts me. 

I'd rather be single and okay than with someone but miserable. "
"Is this conservative? Not sure, everybody I know here in Poland believes this as well and they're mostly liberal people, but here  it might be different. Idk.  
I believe in the gender binary. The vast majority of people are biologicaly either male or female, and are okay with this. And transsexual people also fit into the binary, because they transition from one gender to the other. Personally, I don't fit into most gender roles, I usually dress rather gender-neutral than feminine, I'm into women, I don't feel that my female gender is really an important thing about me- but I'm still a woman, not ""agender"", although I used to identify as that for some time when I heard that term on the internet. But it just doesn't even work in polish.  
In my language there is no way to make gender neutral pronouns or stuff like that. And when you're talking about yourself, you have to use either masculine or feminine verbs, all the time. So even if you really want to be some other gender or be completely free of gender, you have to choose to speak one way or the other. "
"I was out with my parents, both of my brothers and their wives and my sister and her husband. A ragingly drunk dude came up to me and asked me out. I said no. He then went round the table entreating each of my relatives in turn to get me to go out with him. He hung around our table for about half an hour in total. It was ghastly. "
"Oh yeah we definitely called him out. My cousin was like, what exactly makes me the black sheep? And he went on to criticize how in her teen years she was a goth and my cousin, me, and my plus one (my best friend) were like yeah a teen who was expressing herself doesn't automatically qualify someone as a black sheep. We kept doing the whole no I don't understand what you mean please explain routine until he realized we weren't going to agree with his bashing on her and wandered off. Then an hour later we found him at the bar being incredibly racist. I dunno, I think 'closet racist' trumps 'was a goth in her teens' for black sheep in my book. "

"It's not the brainpower, it's the effort. I work 12h kitchen shifts, and fuck doing anything energetic after that. "
"This is me.

If someone life shattering happens I just want to hide in my bed with a bunch of blankets. I'll normally take this time to relax, enjoy some things that I have forgot to enjoy (sometimes there's nothing better than waking up early and having a fresh cup of coffee), and figure out how to fix/deal with whatever happened. I spend a lot of my time thinking about what happened, how it changes things, and what my options are now.

When I'm ready I'll invite people over or hang out*. I don't really like people barging in, offering suggestions, and talking about it while I'm still reeling from it.

*Although, coming over with vodka and to watch tv is cool all the time."
"What's funny is that all the opposite sex couples I know who've engaged in a FWB situation, it's the guy who ended up falling for the woman and wanting to turn it into more, *not* the woman."
"I agree with this 100%. Not only do I not wear jewelry so it may be easier for me, but to me it's the thought that counts."
"Not to engage in conversations or arguments that don't have a clear benefit or possibility of reaching agreement. Like, so many times I see a comment that ten years ago would've gotten me super riled up. Now I look at them and think 'what do I get out of this conversation? What's the possibility that it'll be constructive and worthwhile, or that I'll leave the conversation happier than before I joined it?'

 Because on reddit, the other person will generally *never* be the one to let it go, or find a common point of agreement or whatever, or work to tone down the conversation. So much of the time people jump to as aggressive a stance as possible that I've really learned to just walk away; it's saved me a lot of grief and a lot of karma, lol

I will also say, the karma system often teaches me exactly what people think of what I say in a straightforward positive/negative sense. There's a lot less wondering of 'was that joke funny or way too weird?' when you can see that 7 other people approved of your joke."
Oh and don't forget the other side that men and women can't be *real* friends. She's just friendzoned him! The options are boyfriend or no genuine human companionship /s

"I'm tired of hearing that ""all women are crazy"". I think most of the men who say this have a giant lack of communication with the women in their lives and can't understand why they do the things they do (even if they're normal things) and therefore label us as ""crazy"". "
"Even if that woman does exist, she then has to find the doctor that goes ""Well there's no chance that this woman is mentally unstable, she clearly just doesn't want to be pregnant anymore, so I'm definitely not going to get in any trouble for this. I could induce labor and take the baby out alive with no greater risk to the mother at all, I guess, but I think I'll just kill it because reasons"" "
"People posting PICTURES of their ""big boy who learned to use the potty!"" ugh. gross."
"&gt; he stopped trying and I stopped feeling sexy

With my husband, he's like, ""I'm always ready for sex, so just initiate and I'm good, if I need a shower just tell me and I will!"" 
So he basically stopped initiating because he's 'always down!'. 

Which, in turn, make me stop feeling sexy. Yeah, he's 'always down' therefore always finds me sexy, but uh, make an effort to make me feel that way? We basically had sex once a month for a while because I don't just randomly feel horny, when I'm on birth control I just don't 'get horny'. But I'm super easy to turn on, he just *never tried*, because again he's ""always ready! just ask!"".

After a while I got frustrated, cause I WOULD like to have sex more than once a month, it just doesn't cross my radar, and we had a huuge talk about, dude, if you want to have sex you have to make me feel sexy, don't just wait for me to initiate. Especially with a baby, I'm too fucking exhausted, and when I'm not horny it just feels like yet another chore and I'd rather sleep. Therefore *make me horny damnit*. 

It's improved greatly. We're back up to a few times a week. We both needed to make more of an effort, and we are!   Like him initiating sex more actually has me wanting it more too! In fact I'ma bone him tonight..

"My dog (she's definitely **not** a small dog - about 80-90 pounds) is a big ol' pushover. My (small and elderly) cat likes to take advantage of this.

One time, my dog was lying on its fluffy dog bed. My cat comes up to the dog bed, looks at my dog, and begins meowing. After a while, the dog leaves the bed, and the cat moves on and takes it over. 

Dog then promptly lies on the ground next to the bed, looks at cat, then looks at me with her big old puppy eyes like ""Hey, aren't you gonna back me up here? I thought this was *my* bed..."""

"Yes, nuclear energy is ""clean"" if we're just considering carbon footprint. It's complicated, though, because we really don't have a good way to deal with nuclear waste which doesn't degrade for immensely long periods of time and presents serious risks to human health. It's an environmental justice issue as well because most nuclear waste is stored near low-income communities or on native american reservations in the U.S., placing marginalized groups at disproportionate risk. 

I'm not sure how I feel about nuclear and I think it's important to recognize that there are many legitimate reasons for concern."

"So many people are so unaware of/quick to deny oppression simply because they don't experience it themselves. As a Black woman, I have seen so much sexist and racist shit on here that makes me want to flip a table and curl up into a ball at the same time. Talk about misogyny, you're a feminazi. Talk about race issues, you're racist and your people are causing/making up their own problems.

I also learned I should think before I speak sometimes and that I hadn't really deeply considered several political positions of mine. I think it was /u/bibabeep and her posts here who made me rethink my positions on porn and prostitution rather than just following along with popular beliefs."
"I'd argue that this is more an intersectionality with sexism.

Very attractive men aren't usually discredited or shot down.  This is mainly a thing that happens to attractive women.

As a rather gay-looking lady, I feel like I get a sort of ""conditional male privilege"" in that the fact that I'm not conventionally attractive, and especially because I'm unattractive in a way that is traditionally codified as masculine, means that it's easier for me to be respected for my work than when I presented in a more femme way.  People tend to treat me like ""one of the guys"" and I don't fear sexual violence as much as I did when men were constantly catcalling me."

"Actual advice from my dad:

&gt;When you're in a relationship, you have to learn to be the person they want you to be. You have to be willing to put aside your own wants and needs to help him, because he's the person you picked and you dedicated yourself to. Be the woman he wants you to be, so you'll be happy. 

Two abusive relationships (one moreso than the other) later, and I realized, FUCK IT. I'm going to be me and anyone who wants to date me can take me as I am, and I'll do the same for them. And if it's a ""she"", even better!"

"Get ready to roll your eyes. Because this is probably ridiculous. Let me start by clarifying that I am female. Had an ex who I'd been with for about 2 years at the time. He expressed his desire to implement anal into our sexy time. I've never been interested in anal. AAMOF, I find everything about anal to be unappealing. Not judging anyone who indulges or might enjoy it. I just don't have even a 1% interest in giving it a go. Surely you see where this is going.
So the X stated his piece. I stated mine. X got angry and resentful . After that conversation this is what happened. Any time we  were intimate, he would try his best to create a situation where he could accidentally claim ""it slipped"". He would then start pouting. He pouted about how  I was denying him.  That I must not love him -like I said I did- if I wasn't interested in pleasing him in that way.
What are we? 14?
But, then he started to bring it up all the  damn time. Always in the context of him being unfairly denied. And how that made me a selfish person.
He had no consideration for the fact that I simply didn't to engage. And he didn't care why.

His resentment toward me for not wanting his dick up my pooper caused me to resent him for being such a fucking pouty baby and caring nothing about how I felt about the situation. That resentment dried me right up. I lost all sexual desire for him.
Plus, I was rankled at constantly being called selfish. Especially when it seemed clear that he was exhibiting selfish behavior by always pressing the topic and trying to make it happen ""accidentally.""  I know such accidents can and do occur. But, the X was being strategic about it in order to have plausible deniability.
So I noped out. Booty hole intact. No ragrets."
"The healthy at all sizes movement. 

Like. I get the average size in the US is 16 - but that doesn't mean it should be. 

I understand you can eat healthy and be overweight and I understand there are medical reasons for being overweight - but that doesn't mean we need to be pro-fat. 
The call for plus sized models or even overweight models so girls who are large will feel accepted is insane to me. 

Being overweight doesn't make you beautiful and I'd wager, statistically, overweight/obese people are not as healthy as those who remain active and eat healthy food.

We shouldn't be promoting plus sized or very thin models. We should be promoting athletic, healthy people."

But if someone who isn't south Asian wears a bindi, sari, whatever, it's SOOO hot. It's soooo cute and trendy. My culture is okay, as long as it's not on the brown bodies it belongs to. 

Everyone has a culture, they don't need to steal from mine. If you want the pretty pieces of my culture, you have to take the ugly bits too, including the racism, the harassment.

"I only wear makeup on special occasions- like when I was a bridesmaid. Otherwise, I don't bother with it. I'd rather sleep the extra 10 minutes in the morning before my 2 year old kraken awakes than put on makeup.

My ex-husband used to get pissy about it but he never once lifted a finger to help me in the mornings. He would wake up, put on clothes, and leave. I'd get up over an hour earlier than him, get the baby up, dress myself, dress the baby, make lunches for my ex and me, get all of his work stuff together, wake his lazy ass up, make his coffee, etc. Then deal with him sulking because I couldn't be bothered to put on makeup. When there were countless opportunities for him to behave like a goddamn adult and help me so I could do something like wear makeup.

Fuck that noise. He's the only person who ever complained or gave me shit about not wearing makeup or doing elaborate hairstyles. He's also the guy who got removed from our house by CPS for abuse, so you can decide for yourself what type of person he was.

After he was gone, I just continued to not bother wearing makeup because my acne was better without it and I just didn't see the point in wasting time or money on it.

For what it's worth, I've been dating a very gentle and sweet man for a few months now and he gives zero fucks that I don't wear makeup. He likes me just as I am and makes me more comfortable in my own skin than I can ever recall being. Having someone who accepts me for just being *me* is an amazing feeling."
