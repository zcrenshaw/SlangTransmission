"Surgery jokes are the best. I told the charge nurse one day that I had gotten her a gift. She got all excited and I said, ""Yeah, I got you a new iPad! It's still in the packaging even!""

"Your one big mistake was helping her with an app that was out of your scope. People don't understand that you're trying to be nice and think it's you taking responsibility for that issue and if you fail to fix it, it's now something that was owed to them.  

I used to shut those requests down right away. Make it clear that they contacted the wrong place. ""We only support hardware issues. Are other apps in general working? Yes... So it doesn't seem to be related to a general hardware issue- contact the app developer."" Kindly fuck off."
"That's.. absolutely insane. Why anyone would even consider doing something like this, I will never understand.

Edit: I think a lot of you misunderstood my comment. What I meant was, that I don't understand how anyone would even consider doing ANYTHING else than driving, when driving. :)"
"Another tech office misunderstanding: once had our doc control person come up to me, the engineer in the office, and ask me ""Do you know how to build a bomb?""

"Half of my job (process control programmer for a plant) is tracing back what went wrong when things go wrong.

More often than not, when an operator says he pushed a button, the machine did *exactly* what it said it was going to do.  Lengthy reports are written, but in the end, we are asked to make the machine do what the operators *wanted* them to do, not what they told them to do.  Or when they just push the wrong damn button.

That's horrifying. Did you ever ask how they obtained the iPhone? Did they buy it straight from Apple or second-hand. Because if it's the latter it might've been tampered with.

"They don't understand that the tech doesn't know what the problem is and can't just press the ""fix it"" button. They think the troubleshooting is just a series of hoops they have to jump through for no good reason, and that of they just play along with the ritual the tech will eventually press the ""fix it"" button.


That's my best guess anyway. "
"What we're dealing with is a user who has fallen into a fairly standard problem, and there's not really any way to fix it without her being willing to cooperate and try a radically different way of thinking.

She's turned every task she does on the computer into a mental script. To do X you follow steps 1 - 18 of script ""do X"".

And like a computer running a script (batch file for you Windows only types), if anything changes, her script errors out. 

She doesn't understand how any of this works. To her it's all just random incantations. It makes equally as much sense to her that you'd start ""Google Bing"" by double clicking on an icon that says ""Google Bing"" as it does to start it by turning counterclockwise in her chair three times, pushing the left shift key twice, and then the right control key three times. To her both of those actions seem equally arbitrary and pointlessly complex and random.

The idea that computers follow rules, that things are not arbitrary and random, that it's possible to use a computer not by slavishly following a script but by knowing the way a computer works and using that knowledge to derive the proper way to do things is utterly alien.

One thing you'll often hear from users like this is some variant on the line ""I just don't know how you remember all that stuff"". Because they don't even know it's possible to do things in a different way than they do they imagine that everyone uses computers by memorizing complex and frustrating scripts and following them exactly. So they imagine that we computer people are working by having memorized thousands, millions maybe, of little scripts and do our job by following those scripts precisely.

So of course when her icon name changes she can't start Google Bing! The script says ""double click on the icon marked Google Bing"", there is no icon marked like that, so her mind crashes and all she can do is call tech support.

Users who think this way are often all but impossible to fix, because changing the way you think is extremely difficult. And once they realize they need to change the way they think, they've got to deal with learning how computers really work."

"I've had a customer do something similar. Guy somehow convinced his computer that the .ico (icon image) file for Scrabble was an executable program and then went even further by telling windows to open all .exe files with the scrabble .ico. After logging in(I'm surprised it could even log in to begin with after learning of what he did) his screen filled with errors stating that scrabble.ico was not a valid executable. All of the background programs that start with windows were trying to launch through scrabble.ico. 

We wound up just reinstalling windows and from that point on, any computer we got in that was proper-fscked was deemed ""scrabbled""."

"It's times like these I'm glad I had parents who could openly discuss these topics.  It started with thermal compound, then soldering electronics.  Eventually he taught me about the hard stuff...soldering SMD components, then copper pipes, and even taught me everything he knows abut welding.

People, talk to your kids about the dangers *and advantages* of bonding metals with heat.  Treat it maturely and teach them to handle it with respect...before someone else does.

Edit to add: Just want to mention, the first talk came up because he caught me using tape with a wirenut.  I didn't know that was such an amateur thing to do.  He taught me about when to tape+splice, and when to use a nut...but never use both together.  The one thing just sort of *lead* to another."

And being so technologically, uh, *backward*, she just starts flailing at buttons when that happens trying to get out of the context menu that pops up. Wouldn't take too much luck to scrolls down and left click rename randomly....and a bunch of keyboard mashing later, well, there goes ""Google Bing""

How people remain this technologically literate this far into the 21st century is depressing. Back in the 80s and 90s when I ran across this kind of thing it was expected, with the thought that the upcoming generation wouldn't be this technologically adverse. The fact this hasn't happened is kinda sad.

"I have to say though, as a fellow techie, sometimes i HATE calling support. Example: internet keeps going out


Skipping typical hellos and security questions
Me: So my internet is dropping randomly and Ive already reset the box and tried hard resetting via unplugging for 10 minutes and plugging it back in.

Tech: Well, lets start with you unplugging the box and plugging it back in for 30 seconds.

Me: rolling my eyes and rinsing and repeating the same thing ive done 3 or 4 times. Turned out my box was defective. One quick exchange and it was fixed.

Then i get things like when my brand new lg stylo 2 kept breaking bluetooth and wifi. Found the online submit form, got my printed shipping label and filled in all the troubleshooting i did. Took 3 weeks to get my repaired phone back. The damn scripts they make all CS people go through can be a pain in the ass and makes me want to call before I do anything just so I'm not repeating the same thing I just did."
"Reminds me of my mom. One day she calls me out of the blue:

""Do you think I should contest this?""

""No mom, it's pretty clear that that's you in the car and you're running a red. I think you should just pay the fine and go on with your life.""

""But I didn't mean to! I couldn't see that the light was red because the truck in front of me was blocking my view!"" 

I look at the pictures again. ""It was blocking your view because you were less than 3 feet behind a semi trailer...""

""Exactly! I couldn't have known the light was red! I'm going to schedule a court date.""

""No mom, don't do that. Your defense is you admitting that you were tailgating another vehicle, which will just earn you another fine and possibly points on your license.""

""No, that's silly, I'm sure I can get out of this.""

She didn't."

"I have an Ethernet switch that I can not explain. It's a poor little Cisco 2940, sitting on a shelf in an unheated attic, in a region that got down to -12F this year. It has one of those APC SOHO UPSes powering it, and somehow it has 2.5 years of uptime. 

This is at a site that is off-grid and generates their own electrical power. Long and frequent power outages are the norm. Also, over the past 2.5 years we have completely replaced the electrical distribution system (Undergrounded the electrical system), which also meant re-wiring the service entrance to the building. This required multiple multi-hour outages. We have been evacuated due to wildfire, and shut down the power plant when we left (It was down for 5 hours before the firefighting team showed up). And yet this little switch continues to run."

"Well to play devils advocate, she refers to Bing as ""The Bing"". It's not unreasonable to assume she *may* type ""The Google"" to access Google and hence that's what's ended up on the shortcut.

"A few times that's happened. The first time was the following semester when I realized I couldn't register for classes on the mainframe computer system and had to go down to the actual registration office to do it manually.

"When I was in college in the early 90s I worked the computer lab. This was a community college and we had people of all ages.

There was this sweet 80+ year old woman who was taking the basic computer class and struggling really hard with it. The relevant part here is the fact that she could never remember how to turn on the computers in the lab.

One night she came up and asked for help turning on her computer. I had been having some kind of a day so I was generally being a smart ass.

I rubbed the side of the computer with my left hand saying ""Good computer, gooooood computer!"" while reaching to the back and flipping that big red switch.  She said ""Oh! Thank you, young man!"" and happily went to work.

I had the next night off, so this is second hand. She came up to the lab assistant the next night in tears. She swore she was doing exactly what the nice young man did the previous night when turning on the computer but it wasn't turning on.

The other lab assistant asked her to show them what she was doing. The sweet old lady proceeded to rub the side of the computer, telling her how good it was.

I got in a lot of trouble for that and had to apologize to her. I felt so awful. On the bright side, she remembered how to turn on the computer after that."
