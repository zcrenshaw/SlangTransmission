"Gay or not, I think it's awesome that your son is showing such support and affection to his friend! Lots of boys grow up learning that emotions are not manly or are somehow bad, and that doesn't seem to be the case here. *Don't make him think that being a good friend means he's gay!*"
"Where is this shit even coming from
&gt; My ex

Now it makes sense"
No. Bussy is.
"&gt; Is boypussy the worst word ever invented?

Shitoris probably takes the cake, though"
No. None at all. You are literally the only living gay man who wants a committed monogamous relationship– possibly even the only one in recorded history. Every other gay guy is a coke-fueled party whore hellbent on destroying the cult of domesticity. ;)
i once had this huge crush on this muscular white guy so i got grindr on all seven of my devices and had fake profiles on six of them. i bombarded my target with messages from my six fake profiles and then messaged him from my real profile. i was hoping to contrast my apparent sanity from my real profile with the urgent thirst of my six hoe profiles. omg it worked! he ran out of blocks so i kept bombarding him with my remaining unblocked profiles and he even mentioned it to me in our chat. i ended up joking about it which led to flirting and getting his number and his dick later that night so it was totally worth it.
You're a great guy. Your grandson is lucky to have you. 
"It sounds more like guys with money are better than your broke, disgusting slob of an ex who [apparently] has no redeeming qualities."
Okay.
"I ask because, pardon my French, but based on everything in this thread you're coming off like a huge spoiled brat. Oh no, you're hookup cancelled and now you're on the bus and horny? If that's your biggest problem kid then your life sounds pretty fucking peachy. 

What I think is irritating a lot of the people responding to this thread is that you yourself are young and sound like you can't offer anyone else the things you demand that you are given. That's a seriously entitled attitude and it makes it pretty clear that this older dude is only buying your attention because of your hot, young bod and the fact that it makes him feel less fucked up about his own age to be plowing your barely legal ass. If you are pissed off that another guy can't host, why don't *you* man up and do it? If you can't drive and take the bus, then why don't *you* save up and get a car? 

This thread should really be titled ""let me brag about how smart I think I am because I'm milking a sugar daddy for all he's worth and it makes me feel better about my total lack of redeeming qualities."""
"""If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals."" - Sirius Black"
"It makes me sick to my stomach that this is even a thing. 

You're incredibly hot btw."
Get out of there.
"Theater, definitely. "
"Dude, you have a cool friend now. Keep it that way. Stop dropping people because you can't fuck them."
"Because you don't have any feelings for any of them, and they clearly do. A general rule of thumb is that when you're hooking up with someone and they develop feelings for you, and you don't, then you should get out of there. It's not nice to lead people on, and it will just be extra drama in your life."
"No, you're not the only one. My fiancé asked my father for my hand in marriage. If that's not traditional, I don't know what is."
"I'm struggling to see the point in wearing a shirt like that. It's definitely  to show off those defined bodies that they have. But hey, I'm not complaining."
"Yeah, I have zero problem drooling over a guy in a shirt like that.  I figure that any piece of clothing that shows nipple is an invitation to gawk."
i would also call you daddy in bed
"Real men do whatever the fuck they want.  The best you is the best you.  You've probably got more important things to worry about than if some fuckboy on Grindr thinks you're 5% more masculine.

"Give him a gift certificate to a restaurant so he can take his boy on a date since 15 year olds can't really afford to do that on their own.

Maybe also offer to drive them.

Edit: And you sound like an amazing fucking grandfather"
"Kind of. I'm not really looking for attention, but I'll sometimes download it for a few minutes just to see who's gay around me. "
"Islam is fucked up - so are a lot of other religions. There are punishments in Islam for everything, not only being gay. A (heterosexual) couple coupulating without marriage are meant to be buried up to their necks in the ground and stoned to the death. Just stay away from organized religion, man. It's all crap.

EDIT: Just went through the r/islam thread you linked and was surprised to find a few defensive comments in there.  i thought the whole board would be gathering their pitch forks. "
I hope more than anything.
"No... You do you. Let those people think what they want, you care about being safe. "
So again it boils down to you want to date guys with money
"Screw you, jerk!

...yeah, okay.

We need more people like you in this world. 💛
Who?
The most unbelievable part of this whole story is how a 23 year old owns a house. 
"I would say that you need to focus on getting an education and use it as an opportunity to find a job in a more liberal city. Once you are financially independent from your family, you should tell them. Just remember that if they shun you, it's on them, not you. "
"Would you prefer ""Sir""?"
"Lol. I think maybe they were both unhappy, added a third, then wanted to jump to the first person they clicked with before breaking up with each other. When you're unhappy, it's easy to jump ship, if there's another ship near by. "
"&gt; bussy?

triggered

fuck you"
"Everyone has given pretty good advice so far, but I would just add: be subtle about it. Nothing is more mortifying than a parent dropping overt I-think-you-might-be-gay hints. If he *is* gay, that would put pressure on him to come out. If he's not, well... lets just say that straight teens don't usually appreciate that sort of thing."
"&gt;Try car sex when a horny 20 something says they can host but suddenly can't

So you basically don't want to hook up with a guy who lives with parents/roommates and potentially isn't out.

&gt;Or going to hook up but you don't have a car and the bus is fucking late again so you're horny in the bus, you text the guy and they say ""never mind then"" so you have to back, lonely and horny

And you're taking the bus to them because, gee, you can't host either.  At least he has a car to have car sex in, unlike you.

&gt;Older guys with cars at least pick you up. I don't care if he is driving a used wreck of a car or the newest whatever. A car is car and experience often comes with age

Younger guys have cars too.  But wait, you don't, which is why you're taking the bus and expecting an ""older guy with a car"" to pick you up.

You have no room to talk shit when everything you hate about younger guys applies to you too."
I approve this message.
Yep it was terrifying. I grew up with these two guys same as you.  We are from redneck Wisconsin I came out to both of them at the same time they looked at me and started clapping and said it's about time you said it out loud lol. They said they had bets on when I would come out neither won because they didn't think I'd wait till we were in our 20's lol. They told me nothing would ever change and they've been true to that statement. We're all in our mid 30's now and actually went out to dinner with both of them and another high school friend last tues and caught up. It was great. 
"TBH, I probably wouldn't hook up with a guy who wants to use a condom for oral.

Now when it comes to fucking, if somebody is shaming you for wanting to wrap it up then it's probably best to stay far away. "
"I was on a first date late last week, within five minutes of getting in the car with him, someone forgets to turn on their turn signal for him and he says ""Fucking Asians"". Pretty quickly decided then he wasn't a good person, and it was also our last date."
Yes when the guys didn't look like the pics they sent me. 
"Seriously? I always felt like there is WAY more bottoms than tops. It used to hurt my self-confidence, because it made me feel easily replaced..."
"Ok great. So what's your point then? You can't expect most people in their early 20's to be completely financially stable. It just usually isn't how it works.

Fuck who you want to fuck. Whatever. But you can't compare the financial stability of a 23 year old to a 45 year old nor expect a 23 year old to have life figured out with a house a car and a dog."
they're kind to people who can't do anything for them.
Can the mods sticky this?
"By calling Robert a grown adult, you're making him sound like he's a 30 year old with a stable career. The implication being that he's manipulating your impressionable 15 year old into having sex. He's an 18 year old in college, less than a year out of high school. He isn't even at that age where running your mouth in public will get your ass beaten yet. He's a child.

Do not fuck this kid's life up. "
"Wait until you get in a relationship.

Every hot piece of ass and a lot of past hookups will come out of the woodwork. It's like a sixth sense."
Tips I've picked up. When talking to him casually wipe your chin with the bottom of your shirt. If his eyes drop to your exposed abs prob gay or bi. Straights never look. Gays check crotches. Which his eyes when you wear pants or sweats that show a bulge. Watch em around hot girls or big tits. Gays forget to ogle or comment. Straights always seem to
I love nonexistent tv personalities that give everyone unrealistic expectations to live by too
We've converted another :)
"I think it's the fear that a bi guy could just up and leave and start your typical family with a woman. In the long run it would be easier for them. Not everyone is like that, though... But it's the prejudice that comes with being bi, I guess?"
It's reddit. I assume most posts here are fan fiction.

Actually yes.
"No, it's a bad tradition that comes from a time when women did not control their own lives and were essentially property that fathers sold to husbands. "
"This show is as fem as I get. This show made me have the confidence to come out, if these people are living their gay old lives and having a gay ol' time, why can't I do that?"
"I can't be the only gay guy out there who doesn't have this problem. Have a little self-control. I know that sounds obnoxious but it's like when people ask ""how do I not cheat?"" The answer is you just *don't.* Don't give in to your every whim and desire. Decide they are friends and that sex is off the table, and if mutual attraction and actual romantic feelings start to crop up, that's when you communicate and reconsider. Try not to think of every other gay person you meet as someone you could potentially bang and/or date. "
Bucci is a close second.
"This kinda made my dick twitch a bit.

And by a bit I mean a lot. "
"Dude, I'm older than you and I'd call you Daddy! LoL! You just have that look."
I never see anyone with abs actually do the shirt wipe thing. It's always guys with beer guts..

"That guy sounds like he had a severe case of what I call ""being an asshole"". Pulling out his phone to text someone then laughing at you is despicable, and it crossed the line of disgusting when he did it infront of you. That bitch had **no** class.


&gt; shoot me


No. 3 inches may seem like the end of the universe now, but I promise so long as you keep looking you will find yourself a guy that you love who loves you back just as much, regardless of your dick size. Believe it or not, it isn't the end all card of a situation for some guys, and some guys even prefer smaller dicks. 


You're funny, you've got a great body, you're in college (although I don't know what for) thats 3 out of the 4 boxes checked off right there, dick size is only one thing going against you when you seem like a genuinely kind guy.


Everyone has their own path to happiness. You'll find someone, just keep your head up, be confident, and keep pushing forward. "
"I came out when I was 17, 24 years ago. I lived in rural Ohio, so it was a small town scandal. My dad threatened to beat me straight. He had never threatened me with violence before that, and I cannot tell you how much that hurt me.

Next month, I'm taking him to The Memorial tournament in Columbus. 

My point is that people and attitudes can change. She's your mom, and she is going to do a lot of soul searching about this. Give her space and time to deal with this. Don't automatically assume she is going to disown you."
"You like using older men because they have more money than you, are better-established, and treat you to nice things.

"&gt; My fiancé asked my father for my hand in marriage.

"My mam and dad are open about it. My dad is more...blunt with how he asks ""Had any cock lately?"". The first time he asked me it caught me off guard and I couldn't stop laughing. "
"I was the same! But then I started speaking to a lovely guy and I found out he danced in his spare time which really turned me off. In my head I thought he'd be really flamboyant so I put off meeting him for 3/4 months. When I finally met him I realised he was on the more flamboyant side but he was such a laugh and I ended up not minding it, because he was a decent guy. We dated for a while and although it's ended now, he helped me come to terms with a lot of internalised homophobia I think. I'm a lot more open to gay culture now than I have been before :)
"
"You don't tell him you know he is gay. He will come out when he is ready.

You can try to subtly bring up a topic where you could state your feelings about gay people. That way you would let him know that you're fine with it. "
wow.  This one takes the cake for me
I would consult a mental health professional. Something is off. 
"Being really boring. Like never wanting to go out, always concerned, never wants to just be spontaneous and see what happens, always needing some sort of comfort. 

Edit: one I forgot to add. Always wanting to talk about nothing just for the sake of talking. Silence is fine if there is nothing to be said. Kind of a spin off of that, never being able to have deep juicy conversations. "
And how blasé it was to for everyone to call two days off work to lay around and fuck.

"Only once, and I stopped using Grindr after it.

This might sound rude but do you ever meet someone and get a vibe that they just aren't... all there? That's what I got from this guy. I don't know what possessed me to go through with it but I followed him into the backyard and there was this old naked fat guy just... chilling in the hot tub. The guy and I started doing some stuff, the old man watching, and then I eventually got my friend to text me and fake an emergency. As I was walking in to get my clothes, ANOTHER old guy came out of no where and stared at me while I got dressed. Lmao"

I had a straight friend that I shared some really close moments with. Nothing sexual really. Used to scratch his back until he fell asleep &amp; we'd talk in his car about life for hours. He'd drive all the way to my house for a hug sometimes. We cried together a lot.

"My boyfriend once asked me to toss his salad. I was reluctant to do it but he coaxed me into it. It started out OK, but right as my tongue penetrated deep into his anus, he sharted. The smell of rotten eggs pervaded my nostrils and bits of fecal liquid slid into my mouth. I began to gag, and when he turned around, I vomited onto his stomach, small chunks dripping down to his penis. Before I could apologize, he started gagging and spit up onto my hand as I was going to wipe my mouth. He then darted to the bathroom. I assumed he was going to the toilet to finish puking, but as I hurriedly crossed his path on my way to the door to find another bathroom, I slipped on something mushy and fell. I ended up landing in several piles of mush, and it turns out that he was running to the bathroom to go number two. He didn't quite make it. I could hear his thunderous farts and droppings in the toilet as I commenced gagging yet again.

I eventually made it out and stumbled into his roommate on my way to the other bathroom. He initially laughed but after seeing the bits of vomit and fecal matter that I inadvertently smeared on him, he cussed and ran into the bathroom. Frustrated, I stormed over to kitchen and finished spitting up into the sink before grabbing paper towels and cleaning myself up.

Long story short, I will never toss anyone's salad again."
I'm not sure if I dislike the advice or the word 'shitoris' more...
"Doesn't matter the degree, they are all at George Washington University."
You yelling at him is only making it worse. Have you realized that maybe this behavior fuels his apologetic behavior more?

"Always knew I was gay but the first time I hooked up with a guy properly, fireworks went off "
"Well there were none in my forestry program.  I thought i would maybe run into at least one closeted guy, but even after many long trips in the middle of nowhere for days on end, there wasn't even a single hint of anyone being even ""curious"". 

I was always the token gay.  But the cool thing was that there were some homophobes in my group, but after many long talks on trips over the years, all of them became Pro LGBT because of the friendship.  "
Every day we stray further from God's light.
Because a lot of young gays cling to bisexual because they're unable to admit to themselves that they're gay.

"It's natural. It's been quite a few years but I used to feel the same while at the same time being attracted to them.

Why? You hit the nail on the head. The represent our worst fears... Everybody knowing. And they portrait feminism, which is exactly what we're scared of. 

How? By doing what it seems you're already be doing. Everytime you catch you're self, remember that they are living the life you want. Not necessarily the feminism part, but the open and without reservation part. Remember that they are paving the way for when you ultimately come out. Remember that they are paying the price that you aren't. 

Spend time with them. It'll be uncomfortable for sure (at least it was for me). But remind yourself that you're not that shallow. And that they're not hurting anyone, but just having some fun as they navigate this difficult world. 

Who knows if it'll work for you, but it changed me rather quickly.

Just my 2 cents "
If you're not attracted to him then don't do it. Find someone you consider good looking for your first time.

"I had a crush on this guy in high school, his name was Dustin, and he *loved* weed, cigarets, and underaged drinking. Dustin liked to play games with me by telling me he liked me but then at the same time telling our friends he didn't like me and trying to lead me on (I guess because he liked the attention). 


One day I exposed Dustin for being a fuck boy and I stopped putting up with his bullshit. Subsequently the majority of the school got sick of his shit. The tables quickly turned and Dustin was the one vying for my attention, but I refused to give it to him. He was only giving me scraps of his attention, so he didn't deserve any of mine.


Four years later, Dustin looks like an inflated balloon, complete with literal stretch marks on his face, looking like a stale chip, and actually a couple of weeks ago he sent me a facebook message asking me if I wanted to go on a date with him because apparently he's bi and not straight anymore. Lucky me right!!?! 🙄


Dustin even had the nerve to ask me how I ""still look so young"". A stupid question because I'm literally 22, and he's only 23. You wanna know the answer? I dont do dumb shit that makes you age faster like smoking and shooting up heroin! Dustin's personality is also shot because all those drugs killed nearly every brain cell he had. 


Don't be like Dustin. Don't be a fuckboy for attention. "
"One day I was bragging here how my fiance's dick is ideal, because it's big enough to serve a great pleasure and not too big to make me feel pain. He was all happy and ""fuck yeah! └(‾ꇴ└‾)""... until he saw someone who commented below my comment that his dick is 1 cm bigger than my fiance's...

He got rid of his pants and measured his dick standing next to me... ""16,5 cm not 15"", he said. ""Stop spreading lies""...

So, yeah. Sometimes men become silly when it comes to the dick size. ""Nice dick"" instead of ""Nice big dick"" is probably the best way to say it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"

"Ouch!!!!  Dude... you've got some MAJOR apologizing to do.  I would say that you were/are coming across as insecure by the sounds of how you described the evening.  Sounds to me like your boyfriend was just being friendly to the bartender.  Just ask yourself this: if a straight bud or a female friend of yours had been in your boyfriends place and exchanged the exact same conversations as your boyfriend had with the bartender would you have thought it was inappropriate?  And even IF it there was some light flirting going on... is it really that big a deal?  I mean, he's YOUR boyfriend and you were right there.  You may have read way too much into it.   Unless its an ongoing issue and your boyfriend is constantly flirting with other guys (which wouldn't be cool at all) why not just let it go?

As for what you said to him... that kind of insult is just downright... COLD and CRUEL.  You knew just the right words to hurt him and make him feel... like shit.  Right at the heart of his insecurities.  You made him CRY!!!

I'm not saying all of this to make you feel bad... I just think you should know how it looks to an outsider.  I think you need to do something REALLY special to let him know that you realize how badly you hurt him and how sorry you are for that.  AND... that going forward he doesn't need to feel like you are going to get jealous when he talks to other guys.  Because if and when you guys go out again... he's going to feel pretty uncomfortable talking to other guys in front of you.  Just chill out!

Hope everything works out for you guys man!  :)"

Ditch the cargo pants and the heavy belts, get yourself a nice pair of well fitting jeans, don't have to go super skinny, but at least slim cut... wear them a bit lower down, like on your hips not up around your waist

Ditch that black jacket, it's a bit old guy ... your shirts are ok, just don't tuck them into your pants 

Your hair isn't bad by any means but maybe adding a little shape might help.. instead of the straight across fringe- try and find a hip/cool barber and ask them to do what they think (It might be more expensive but you only have to do it once, then your regular hair person can copy it) 

Happy gay-i-fying 🤓😄"

"I had a group project with this cute guy from my class, he stayed over after some discussion to drink vodka coke. That ended up with him curled up into my neck saying that I'm really cute and when I went ""I thought you were straight?"" I get this, ""I am, but I'm making an exception for you.""

Was his first sexual experience, and he prematurely shot in my mouth. Great times. "
"Only real men do ass to mouth, step your game up bruh. "
People here are too SJW-like to recognise that Islam and Christianity are the enemy. That's why my posts have been getting downvoted. Fuck all Christians and Muslims. 
"So...did you call him your ""good boy"" in return as common courtesy?  :-)"
Old might as well be replaced by educated and well off. I'm 28 and you might as well be talking about me. 
Your dad is abusive because he doesn't like himself and is repressing being gay. He's threatening you because he's scared. I'd plan to get out of there (far away from him) and then squeal. Fuck him. He doesn't deserve your silence or respect. Your mom deserves to know who she's married to.
"12 years together and he goes to bed an hour or two before me, when I climb into bed, he immediately rolls over and spoons me with his arms wrapped around my chest. I feel like i am in heaven. "
"[Barry Goldwater aptly predicted the problem the Republican party was having, and would continue to have.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3WZlWhQbns) When the Christians took over the Republican party and turned it into a religious organization, they destroyed it and American politics. You can't negotiate with far right Christians because they feel like they're called from god and god don't compromise. 

[To further quote him:](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/5/19/1385982/-50-Years-Ago-Barry-Goldwater-Saw-the-Future)

&gt; ""Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them.
The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are NOT using their religious clout with WISDOM. I'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person, I must believe in 'A,' 'B,' 'C,' and 'D.' Just who do they think they are?... I will fight them every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all Americans in the name of ""conservatism.""

[Goldwater was a big advocate for gay rights too.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater072894.htm) Old Goldie wouldn't recognize his party if he were alive today. "
Sounds like you're not loving it
"Go to the emergency room, tell them you think you may have been raped. They will get a kit done and if necessary, call the police. "

That's a perfect example why starting a roleplay before getting consent is not a good idea. (◔◞◔)

"
A big number of gay guys doing the Chinese and Japanese programs at my school too. An informal poll we did at a language forum revealed that about half of all active members were either gay or bisexual - even more if we had only asked the guys. It seems language learning is popular among gay men. 
"Just take a couple of deep breaths when you start to freeze up and remind yourself that you are looking at a mammal belonging to the same species that you belong to. Observe any physiological responses you have to their beauty, but once you observe your response, remind yourself that you are observing the physiological response as it happens and that therefore you are not identical to the physiological response. The response is transient and you will remain long after it subsides. "
"Normally I'd say not to do anything about it and remove yourself from this guy's life completely.

But after reading that, I think the wife needs to know."
They're not str8. They're just jealous bottoms.
"Since Daily Mail is a traditionally unreliable source, we should show some patience in finding out what is really going on here. Crying wolf doesn't help us now if stuff like this happens later and trust is already lost because we ran with a bad source. Concentration camps and organized genocide are a serious claim that should be investigated thoroughly. We just need to aim before firing.

Daily Mail has a single source for the concentration camps, which is Novoya Gazeta. Does anyone from that region know the reliability of that publication?

When Daily Mail followed up with two different aid groups in the region, they confirmed that things were bad for gay people, but didn't confirm there were camps. Read the Amnesty International comment in the article. They discuss the recent harassment and overall tone toward LGBT people. I trust Amnesty International and I believe they'd be the front of the line to tell people concentration camps were happening if it was confirmed. Doesn't mean it's not happening, but it means people who work closely in the region haven't confirmed it yet and aren't willing to publish that as quickly as Daily Mail is."
I don't think I truly appreciated being gay until I heard the stories from all of the different people that have been on this show. It's truly a great way to learn to love yourself in my opinion. 
How brave they are.

"Dude as someone who was raised a Muslim, fuck every single bit of that religion. It's the most intrusive,violent, and authoritative ideology I've ever encountered."
"Went to one guy's house and he opens the door.  The first words out of his mouth were, ""wow.  You look just like my dad.""  After about 30 minutes of sitting on the couch watching a movie, and not touching at all, I was like, ""sooo... I can just go.""  And he looked at me, totally relieved, and was like, ""that's probably a good idea.  I should have asked for a face pic because you literally look just like my dad and that's just super weird.""  "
"We used to argue about random philosophical things on LiveJournal. Then it turned out we were in adjacent middle school classrooms. He liked going around to hug people. One day I was feeling down and needed a hug, so I went to look for him to get a hug. One thing led to another..."
"I have a similar problem, I feel like tops just attract each other, its gotten to a point where I sometimes message guys who say masc4masc just so I can guarantee a bottom."
I dont have friends. 
"why are you sympathizing with non-turn signalers?

People like you... are the reason I browse /r/askgaybros
Well damn! Drag her! Lol. The truth hurts. 
"In my legal work I see crazy, fucked up shit all the time (for instance, today a case of a hillbilly red-neck man chaining his step-child in the basement and orally sodomizing her repeatedly and beating her, while his actual child is the political football of a divorce with the mother of the step-child). I also see crazy stupid, weird relationship crap that aren't too dissimilar to stuff here. Point being you don't know what is real or not. So why waste the effort, or more pertinently, why risk telling someone their real life is a lie.  

If you don't like it, don't read or respond to it.... "

I usually pick up on it when I'm riding his dick reverse cowgirl. Usually.
"Yeah, this is on you. You weren't clear enough. 'Grab a beer' is a thing men do with friends and acquaintances as well as gay men with dates.

I'd say totally be friends with this dude, so long as you're cool with sex/romance never ever happening. If you think you can laugh about this with him at some point as a friend, definitely foster the friendship. (Obviously if you think you can't stop crushing on him, don't do it.)"
"Consider reporting him to the police. In many places, what he did is illegal."
"He can crack me up incredibly easily. Like, we will just be sitting in bed together watching TV and he makes a small comment or joke and I lose it. The best part is that he usually didn't think it would be that funny when he said it. So when he sees me laughing that hard, he starts to laugh and it's the cutest most real and genuine laugh. "
"Once I showed up at this guy's house for a hookup and he was being really suspicious. He would be whispering and giving me one word answers. At first I thought that maybe he lived with someone but there was clearly no one here. The second we close the bedroom door, he starts feeling me up and what not but I couldn't shake the feeling that something's wrong. It's then that I heard a noise from the closet; either this guy's pet it in there or something really creepy is going on. I push him off, walk straight to the closet and rip it open while he screams in the back ""Don't!"" Inside is a middle aged overweight naked sweaty man with a raging hard on. I was speechless, grabbed my sweater and was out of there before I ended up on the evening news. "
Yall nasty
"&gt;Burry that big daddy cock inside that bussy?

Yes, verrry much so.

&gt;Did you cum full blast?

*sigh* We had a great time, but he wasn't good at knowing his thresholds as a bottom, so kept begging me to go deep/hard when he couldn't actually handle that. I had to be super gentle (which is fine). Problem is I twitched slightly as I came and went a tad deeper, he yelped in pain, and I had to pull out while I was coming. Kind of a ruined orgasm. :/ (He was totally fine and had a brilliant experience; I'm not a jerk, it just sucked a bit for me at the end.)"
My bussy is triggered.
Speaking as an ex Muslim and gay. Most Muslims (~95%) don't accept gays. And many would literally want to kill or jail gays. So what's your point?
"Success! So happy for the both of you. You'll find that your relationship is only going to be that much better because of this (as you can already see!)

Best of luck to the both of you! :D"
"That's the saddest justification I've ever seen for someone caring about you tbh. ""They gave me $3 and didn't even ask for it back so you can say we're getting pretty srs"""
"&gt;They have houses if that doesn't turn you on then I don't know what does.

Obviously.
"Then how do you explain straight guys who freeball in basketball shorts?

Checkmate, atheists. "
"I feel like the other comments are kinda negative. I guess it depends on the attitude of the place you're teaching. When I was in school, we were all very friendly to our teachers and shared parts of our personal lives with each other. My advice: just be natural about it. I wouldn't bring it up out of the blue, but if you're having a conversation and it's relevant, casually mention it as you would any other detail. They may ask questions, so be prepared for that, but don't make a big deal about it. Because it's not."
"Don't ever go into Ikea.  That always made me jealous.

"&gt; they portrait feminism

"Two dudes walked out on me

One was where the guy met me and said ""hey sorry man, I dont think I can do this""

The other one was when the guy came to my house, and said ""my housemates need (i forgot what)"" and asked if it's ok to come back later, never did.

Those 2 really took a jab on my self confidence lol, the true reason I will never know but I am sure it's somewhere along the lines of my looks. I don't photoshop my pictures at all, I just get good angles and sometimes lighting as well. Makes me cringe as I wrote this story down.

I always tell myself that it's 2 out of many and that there might be other reasons, but I always come to the conclusion that I look uglier irl ;_;

edit: formatting gore, quotation marks everywhere, also crappy use of english lol"
Only half?
"""Tell your religious conservative parents that you're gay""

""Actually tell a guy that you're not interested instead of ghosting""

Masc4masc total top edition: ""bottom for a fem guy"""
"As a rather tall top I'm not complaining! Especially when you add in that many guys have a hookup with a tall top and his big thick cock on their sexual fantasy list :)  
  
A while ago I did meet up with a 6'5"" very fit guy with a big cock that particularly wanted to meet up with me because he enjoyed bottoming but he normally had to top, as so few guys wanted to top him. Which is silly if you think about it. Seemed even sillier after being in his bed! ;)"
Boochie
"On the bright side, at least they've stopped asking why you don't have a girlfriend."
No it's Mussy - man pussy
"Somehow I can't find hot all these ""iconic"" handsome male celebrities like Brad Pitt, Chris Pratt, Jake Gyllenhaal or Ryan Rosling. I know that they are attractive, but I can't find them hot. (･ิ_･ิ)

I thought that tops are a myth?
"""Thank you for telling me,"" or ""I appreciate you telling me,"" is a much more receptive and supportive response when you let yourself be vulnerable about an issue you're having instead of, ""I think your problem is..."" or ""you should do...""  It shows they're listening and not just jumping to an answer, or that they thought of one as I was speaking and decided to clock out early in the conversation.  "
"The garbage social justice movements will try to slap an ""ist"" or a ""phobic"" onto everything. You're transphobic if you only date cis guys. You're ageist if you don't date older guys. You're ableist if you wont date a paraplegic. You're racist if you don't want to date black guys. (But if you *only* date black guys you're guilty of fetishizing them!) 

You can't win with these people. No matter what you do, someone will come along and say that you're some kind of a disgusting bigot.

Pretty soon they're going to call us misogynists for not dating women!"
Don't let your sexuality define you. It's such a small part of who you are. 
"&gt; I'm pretty masculine... so people don't necessarily assume I'm bi.

Those who for whatever reason believe they get to have committed relationship type rights and expectations from you when you barely know them and haven't promised them anything.
