"Pros: I have a personal heater in my bed during the winter.

Cons:  I have a personal heater in my bed during the summer."
"Went suit shopping with my SO and his mom and she kept talking to the tailor about how my SO needs ""*just a little more room in the package area*"" and trying to get me to confirm for her. Like no lady I'm not gonna talk with you about your son's dick but thanks anyway."
"They changed the rules in the ""Life"" board game so that we had to take the college route.  "
"Mine gave me a curfew but kept pushing it back later and later - first 11, then 12, then 1. I didn't socialize much and certainly didn't party, and I got the impression that they set the first curfew expecting to have to rein me in, and then got worried I wasn't social enough so they'd push it back to try to get me to go out more.

One time in my senior year I did stay out past midnight. My mom called me *losing her shit* that she wanted me home even though she knew where I was and my ""curfew"" wasn't passed yet. I didn't have a car, and my friends weren't ready to leave to I had to beg a boy I barely knew for a ride, basically put myself in a more dangerous situation due to my mom's anxiety."
"Doing their share of chores in a shared living space.

 I've seen this issue ruin relationships of all kinds. "
"Ate coconut pie while visiting his family. In their culture you don't turn down food, ever.

I hate coconut pie, and every other pie they offered. But the first time I visited, I turned them down about 20 times without realizing I was insulting them, wondering why they kept asking and asking...

So I eat the pie now."
"They made a lot of complaints about my hair.  I have curly hair and neither of my parents do, so I guess they didn't know what to do with it.  They made disparaging remarks whenever we went somewhere together, like ""Can't you run a comb through that rat's nest?""  Of course, combing and brushing the shit out of it just made it worse, it got so frizzy and poufy.  

And then the icing on the cake is that when they adopted my sister, who is biracial, they went out of their way to find out how to care for her hair and buy whatever products she needed.  And they'll rub it in my face (completely unaware of what they're doing) by comparing her hair to mine, ""Oh her hair is just so gorgeous, don't you wish you had hair like hers when you were her age?"""
"You could ask if they'd be willing to place a wager on that bet that ""you'll change your mind.""

Signed. In writing. 

With $100 bets from multiple people, you could buy a small aircraft and paint ""*I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO*"" on it, then fly it around their neighbourhood after you hit menopause.

Or you know, take someone else's advice "
Compliments on things other than our appearance.
"Go to basically any of his work functions. I have nothing in common with any of his coworkers, am way younger than most of their spouses, and don't have a high opinion of the company because they take advantage of their employees. Plus all the shop talk bores me to tears. I am horribly out of place at those things. 

The only saving grace is that most of these events are open bar.  "
"My parents telling me ""I could be anything"" in a dissapointed way. I'm a gifted, intelligent person, but work as a cook which is apparently ""beneath me"".

Didn't help almost my whole family is white collar women with business degrees. I actually make more in salary than they do and have ten years experience, but for whatever reason my family considers this a waste of potential and that I'm a dead beat because of it. I work seasonally on an island as a sous chef and co-run a successful food truck/waitress at a high end restaurant in the off season. I have a life I can afford and travel with, a great social life and I want for nothing.

I'm happy and don't consider that a waste."
"Whenever I'd been naughty and was grounded or sent to my room, I wasn't allowed to read. That was my favourite thing to do as a kid. I was allowed to watch tv but preferred to rebel by going to the bathroom and reading labels on the back of bleach/shower gel etc."
"When I want/have to do something, l almost always have someone to do it with. 50 percent of the work, twice the fun. I like him so much that 7 years in I am still excited to go on a walk with him, change my schedule just so we can drive home together."
"Definitely. One-sided love is pretty heartbreaking. Years ago, I fell hard for a friend who didn't like me back. I had to distance myself and basically grieve because I'd never be with him."
"when my younger siblings and I would fight, my mom would get so mad that she would say ""I'm going for a drive and if i die, it's going to be your fault"". I used to sit on the window ledge for what seemed like an eternity until she came home safe. I hated that feeling "
"I'm a hypochondriac, he has EMT training and constantly reassures me that I'm not gonna die. It's bliss. "
And in my culture it's rude to insist that I eat food I don't want to eat. So it's a standoff. 
"Body odor.

For the love of God, just invest in some Irish spring and deodorant. You don't have to have the Axe body spray or old spice. As long as I don't smell YOU we're good."
"I'm not necessarily a bubbly person, but I am very friendly and outgoing. In a previous job I had to do a lot of training of new hires and ongoing training. I worked well to be very friendly in that role, but I also needed to be taken seriously and have everyone's respect that I knew what I was talking about (especially when I had to do ongoing training for whole departments). First, stop with the self-deprecating humor. It can be interpreted as you lacking confidence in your abilities and show low self-esteem. Next, it's fine to be friendly and perky and all that most of the time, but when it comes to instruction time, I would literally say something like ""alright, time to get serious and get to this training"" or get to work or whatever. So you can be friendly and jokey when chatting in the break room, but when you are showing someone something, cut the jokes out and focus on the work. It's about balance. "
"Constantly says ""It was just a joke!"" when he's insulting you/other people when he didn't get the positive response he wanted. 

Doesn't know that it's actually possible to speak English without cussing every third word, even when he's not angry. "
"Its so annoying. I got my tubes tied after my third kid was born. I was 26, and more than ready to be done having kids. I still got those questions and I still do on occasion now at 35. ""What if you want more?"" ""What if you and your husband get divorced?""

Ya know what? We are divorced, and I still don't want any more. "
"talk to his father. he was very pervy, constantly talking to me about my body (I'm a bigger woman so I have large boobs and a big butt) or touching me inappropriately. he was also a giant alcoholic and once asked to take a shot from between my boobs, followed by ""can I at least motorboat 'em?"" when I said no. "
"Guys who put down other women as a compliment to you. 

For example: I'm so glad I met a girl who plays video games and reads comic books. Most women are fake and shallow.""

Yeah, don't do that. Not cool."
"&gt; basically put myself in a more dangerous situation due to my mom's anxiety.

I fucking hated this. I did this to myself SO MANY TIMES just to get home in time to avoid my mom's stupid wrath. I let tipsy friends drive me home. Or I would drive their car because I was sober, park it at their house, then walk the rest of the way back to my house. Or they would sit in the passenger, then after getting to my house, they'd drive off even though they were intoxicated. 

One time I asked her if I could spend the night at a friend's over new year's eve, because I didn't want to drive home that night because there's always an influx of drunk people on the road on new year's eve. ""Fine, you don't want to drive? I'LL PICK YOU UP."" and she literally did.  The point was I didn't want any of us to be on the damn road. "
"We couldn't watch South Park. 

But it was LITERALLY the only thing we couldn't watch. They would let us watch R-rated movies with them, any other TV show you can think of. But South Park was where the line was drawn.

Fun fact, a few years ago I was staying with my parents and watching the South Park movie when my dad came in right during the Uncle Fucker song and he laughed for like 15 minutes. "
Long nails on a guy. Yuck. 
"Learning about who I actually am vs. Grand Romantic Gestures. If you were listening you would know that dress you bought me isn't my size, and that date you took me on was expensive and unromantic because I don't like that band or that food, and when you bought me a box of chocolates or ice cream when I told you I was going off sugar, I didn't appreciate it for a reason. it's like they don't know you at all at worst, and at best, they just aren't' listening because they have a script. It's basically token actions, without much real thought, as if all women must be satisfied with effort. Just any effort, or else she's unappreciative."
"More specifically I see men not caring about the running of the household. They'll do chores when asked specifically to do things (usually after some nagging) but they don't look around and think ""this kitchen needs to be cleaned, and we are running low on toilet paper"". They think that if they do chores that's enough, while their wives/girlfriends are getting more and more resentful of being put in the role of having to keep track of everything and nag to keep the household running."
"Spending time with his mum. She's a nice person but I kind of don't like her that much because she's quite demanding. She expects everyone should fit or fulfil her demands because she's old, and because my boyfriend tries so hard to be a good son, he normally would do it even though he doesn't really want to.

Like one time my SO had a serious allergic reaction from his meds, to the point he couldn't talk, his lips were swollen and his thumbs and toes were black. I rushed him to hospital thinking he's dying, but his mum asked him ""so where are you going? Can we go for a movie?"" Ffs. Your son is sick and what? 

Sorry this turned out to be a rant."
"I broke up with my ex because of his fetishes. We started out ""normal"" and super vanilla because that's all I knew. Then he kept telling me about things that he would do with his exes and compare me to them constantly, from the more basic (full on lingerie &amp; heels, or role play type costume) to the more extreme (hot wax, choking out, latex/leather hoods, cutting each other???). I wasn't comfortable and didn't have as much experience as him, clearly. He also liked total domination and wanted me to call him names/basically be 100% submissive. He was into BDSM and I wasn't. For Halloween one year we went to the Armory in SF - I had no idea what it was and thought it was some haunted house dealio- I was petrified and kept begging to leave, and he wouldn't let me because of how ""expensive the tickets were."" He liked for me to take pictures of myself  and send them to him. Then he told me to start posting on GoneWild. I did a couple of times but wasn't comfortable at all, at least I never posted my face. 

The final straw was when he would have sex with me in my sleep. He totally loved that because he had so many rape fantasies that I wouldn't go along with. So sex with sleeping GF = totally ok and not rape? It took a lot of pleading from my friends to get me to see that what he was doing was not ok in any way. Where I grew up I thought that once you're in a relationship it's all consensual. 

"
"Not a rule but I grew up thinking that after you definitely graduate high school then you go to college. No ifs, ands, or buts."
"...could he not tell them himself? I mean, he probably knows best if he's IN THE SUIT"
"I always give my single guy friends this advice about complimenting a woman: Compliment her on something she has control over. Sure, we all like to hear that our eyes are pretty or you like our smile. However, if you don't know anything about a woman (like it's a first date or something) you can compliment her hair or her outfit choice. These are things she ""fashioned"" herself. As you get to know her, you'll find other things to compliment that aren't appearance related. But if you're going to make an appearance related compliment, pick something she actually has some control over. "
"Make padsicles.  Get really long and heavy duty maxi pads.  Unwrap them and put on a aloe vera gel.  Roll the pads back up and keep them in your freezer.  They feel amazing while you are healing!  You can google this for a more thorough tutorial. 

Keep the peri bottle easily accessible in your bathroom.  It really hurts to pee without it!

Take it easy on yourself.  I am a fairly fit person and I was surprised at how weak I was afterward.  Just going for a walk around the block made me really sore and made my bleeding pick up.  After that I was more careful. "
Cooking dinner when he knows I'm working late. Or visiting me at work if I'm working weekends. It warms my heart!
"Couldn't read Harry Potter because ""witchcraft""."
"We were at dinner with his family, at a restaurant, when I found out that his mom found our sex toy drawer. Everyone knew about it but me. I debated leaving forever, or just dying."
"A guy I dated lost his virginity through rape when he was very young (it was an older, stronger girl who did it to him). He somehow couldn't stay in the moment during sex. He couldn't let go. He had these moments where he just had to stop all of a sudden, he had to know it was on his terms I guess. It was really sad. Made me really angry at the girl who did it to him. She took something from him that is gone probably forever. Though we didn't work out as a couple (he had all sorts of issues with commitment), we stayed friends for a pretty long time. I cared about him a lot. "
Anyone who supports Trump.
"Always coming home to his company. It makes every work day better knowing I can leave all those stresses behind and enjoy time with my SO.

Also it sounds weird but I love doing mundane chores with him. Grocery shopping each week is a small highlight. "
"My mother was getting her law degree and working P/T while my father worked days. While studying for the Bar Exam, she forgot my sister and I had gone to a friends house for dinner and proceeded to call 911 which created a town-wide manhunt. From that day and for the next year of our lives, we were made to write where we were going in a book and have her sign it before leaving. "
"When i was in the 3rd grade I used to sometimes go without a shirt like my younger brother and sister. I didn't have any boobs yet. I remember my mom sat me down to tell me that I needed to start wearing shirts around the house (okay not problem). But they way she phrased messed up my relationship with my father for years.She did mean well though. 

She said that me not wearing shirts made my father uncomfortable. She said that older men might want to hurt me and that I could be raped.

My father is not a rapist. He isn't interested in teen girls. I believe it was just ill phrasing that my mother didn't realize would be such an issue. 

Growing up, any compliments from my father about my appearance I took as a sexual advance. I wouldn't let him touch me or hug me. I purposely wore baggy clothes if we were ever alone together. I didn't like it if he called me pretty. Even now I still consciously dress down.  He thought I hated him and I didn't have the heart to tell him that i was afraid.  

Things became their absolute worst when I had my teeth removed as a teenager and had to take some pain medication that made me drowsy (but if I didn't give into the drowsiness It made me loopy.) It was just my dad home to take care of me and I remember screaming from the top of my lungs for him not to rape me. I was *pleading* for him not to even touch me to move me to my bed. I remember him crying and asking why I wouldn't just sleep. I really really hurt him. He never told my mother about what happened and he stopped talking to me. 

Eventually I went to therapy and sorted things out. Now things are better but my dad still is concious about the things he says. I trust him but I still have issues trusting men. He would never hurt me or my sister or his future grandchildren. But it's amazing how such an innocuous thing affected me for years. 

EDIT: grammar and clarity"
"My brother's curfew was 12am, mine was 10pm. I'm 3 years older than him. "
Hugging me. Sometimes I feel so lost but when I'm in his arms I feel safe and grounded.
"My ex had a foot fetish and used to ask me to fuck him in this position where I'd sit on his cock and lean back with my feet in his face. I could actually *feel* him swelling up inside me when I did it, but the position did nothing for me and he actually ended up complaining that my feet didn't smell enough.

Was a killer exercise for my abs though, so there's that."
Having someone to cook with and for. Someone to open jars and problematic pakaging. Getting to share the tidying around the home. Not having to carry all the groceries by myself. Having someone to share the bed with. And having someone to give you hugs when you're sad or upset.
Arrogance and people who refuse to apologize for their mistakes.
people act like this after *three* children?! what the hell
"Orgasms. 

Admittedly this doesn't apply to all men, but I've encountered enough who just didn't even have it on their radar for it to deserve a mention.  "
"Being a decent person (aka, a good personality), as weird as that sounds? Guys (at least on Reddit) seem to think women exclusively date buff assholes. "
"My current boyfriend was abused by his ex, I always knew she was crazy but I didn't realise how it was affecting him. When I used to get tired and grumpy he'd be so upset almost close to tears because he'd assume it was his fault. He would constantly try to be high energy and jokey even when it was inappropriate. I learned this was because his ex treated him like a flying monkey and would scream and cry when he didn't ""make an effort"". He had insomnia, nightmares, drank way too much and thought he was too blame. I found it very exhausting just dealing with it, constantly reassuring him that we were fine and I just want him to be himself was difficult and annoying. I sometimes felt like I was dating a child. He'd shut down to the tiny bit of criticism and vow to fix himself, it's been 9 months now and it got a lot better in the last two months. He sleeps properly, is gaining weight and we can proper conversations about our problems."
"He exists in my house.

Like... I liked living alone.  Doing whatever, never telling anyone about the weird shit that I was doing.

I want to go out and get Gatorade from the corner store at 1 AM?  Whatever.  I want to lay on the floor and look at the floorboard and wonder how it got that dirty?  No one's gonna ask.  I decided suddenly that it was time to purchase and complete a child's weaving project to make potholders?  Great!

But husband exists so he's always (benevolently) asking questions.  Where are you going?  Why are you doing that?  What's that thing?

Ugh."
"a man having *too* close of a relationship with his mother. the kind where he hangs on her every word, needs her input on everything, etc.

TL;DR- mama's boy"
"thats gross as fuck, at that point I think i would just cut contact."
The Armenian Genocide.  Wasn't even mentioned until college and even then it wasn't covered in depth.
"I've had BFs who had a kink or fetish I wasn't OK with.

Some were so unacceptable to me that I simply said ""OK, that one I can't cope with"" and we move on.

Others were more ""let's find a common ground"". Like, I had a BF who had a foot fetish and I absolutely hate people touching my feet. I asked him what turned him on about it (specifics) and I explained the details of my aversion. In the end we found a perfect half-way house: sexy shoes in bed."
"Don't feel like you have to entertain your guests.
 I remember having family and friends over to see the baby when my oldest was born and trying to look presentable and make sure my apartment was clean and everyone had food and drinks, it was stressful and exhausting and it made me feel very resentful.

When my youngest was born if someone popped by I would just hand them the baby and relax. They were more than capable of getting their own drinks and snacks and if they wanted to judge me for being unwashed and in my pajamas at 4 pm, and having baby stuff strewn everywhere, that was on them. I had a newborn and a toddler, I didn't have time to take care of adults.

Witch hazel wipes are wonderful, so are sweat pants and cheap granny panties that you don't mind ruining. Ice packs are also really helpful.
If you plan to breast feed, make sure you have some kind of nipple cream."
"At my SO's grandfather's funeral, I pulled his BIL aside and explained to him that this was not an appropriate time to discuss his zombie apocalypse fantasies. SO could have handled it himself, but I didn't think he should have had to."
"Spend time with his family. They don't like me and it was fucking awkward. They don't want me being with him because I'm sick, and also since he ran his mouth to his mother about me being mentally ill it's even worse. Then his mother told everyone else and I'm the poor little girl with mental illnesses their kid is sadly dating/marrying. Family functions suck."
"No dating until you graduate high school (18 years old).
When I reached 18 years old, ""No dating until you are in senior year of college."" (22 years old). 

This includes going out of any sort with any friends at all. "
"I've always known my marriage is awesome. 

Lots of things make it awesome but i think the main point would be:

- we work hard on it and regularly check in  with each other about how our relationship is going "
"He definitely could have, but for whatever reason she really, really wanted to share."
"Had an ex who was big in the kink scene (I'm pretty kinky myself) so for the first few weeks it waa great fun. 

Then he starts talking about age play - still kink, all talk, and how he wants me to dress up in nappies etc. Talking about getting me pregnant and fucking me for fun. I'm getting uncomfortable now, but go along because well, it's just talk. 

Then his dirty fantasies get ridiculous. Starts talking about hot girls in school uniform he sees on buses, and one of his mates had a baby so we should get the baby over... !!!!! 

Noped so fast out of that one. He was so normal when not horny!"
Probably to see a woman I trusted act silly and not worry what other people thought of her. 
"- Referencing or utilizing The Red Pill or PUA, or playing any kind of mind games.

- Cheating/disloyalty or approving of disloyalty (i.e. Encouraging your friends to cheat, or trying to get with your friend's girlfriend).

- Aggressive behavior. Yelling, throwing things, punching things, slamming your fist on things, etc. This includes when it's not directed at me.

- Body odor, brown teeth, or any other sign of generally not taking care of yourself.

- Being a slob to the point where it's disgusting. Moldy dishes, unpleasant odor, open packages of food everywhere, wrappers on the floor, etc."
"Simple conversation. So many guys I have tried to talk to recently are too busy trying to be complimentary or say *that thing* which will make me want to throw my clothes into the wind to sleep with them, but they can't hold a normal conversation. How is anyone supposed to have a relationship if you can't just talk to each other about every day stuff? "
"Ugh, I **hate** this kind of BS sexualization of young girls. It either implies you are *trying* to attract your stepdad/brother and wearing normal clothes would be *asking for it,* or implies they lack any self control and are just *waiting* for you to wear a smaller shirt and shorter shorts so they can assault you because they are animals with no self control.  Both are awful assumptions and do a disservice to both sexes when they're taken as fact. "
"I think creepiness is underscored by possible threat. Even though the vast majority of men would never hurt you, the potential for physical violence exists in a way it doesn't in women. 

I also think that women generally read social cues better. "
"That's how I grew up.  My parents didn't go, but I never gave a thought to NOT going."
Being rude.
I constantly worry that people only put up with me and no one actually likes me.
Devil's water? Hell's nectar? I feel like i just stumbled into a Western.
"The way they teased me whenever I was around boys: ""he's your booooyfriieeeeeeend"", and making fun of me whenever I was friend with a boy or mentioning a boy. I would avoid talking or getting near any boy for my whole scolarity until 14-15 years old. And by that age I was already bullied to oblivion by any other kid at school anyway so no male teenager would come next to me anyway...

Now as an adult I can't function properly with men... I don't know how to behave normally around them, I can't get in a normal relationship etc.

I'm not saying it's all because of my parents, but I know it played a lot in my relationship with men."
"I ended up breaking up with his son so thank god I never had to see him again. but before that I was forced to associate, when I mentioned to my bf that I was uncomfortable with him I got ""but he's my *dad.* he's joking, it's just how he *is.*"" guess who ended up being exactly like him..."
"I start questioning their life choices, use a horse as a metaphor for a child (""oh I'm sure you'll change your mind once you find the right stable! It's different when it's your own""), and ask why they think they know better for me than I do. ""you've known me for what, a month? Well, I've known me for *27 years*. I think I can handle this."" I haven't gotten to the point of asking them about *their* sex lives/activities yet, but I can see that happening too. Maybe I'll just ask invasive medical questions as a stepping stone. "
"Holy shit, my boyfriend gets so hot when he sleeps, I swear one night he's gonna go supernova."
I'll grin and bear a lot when it comes to an open bar.
"I'll say this: it never stops. I'm 38. Never been pregnant, never wanted kids. People *still* tell me I'll change my mind. There is nothing you can do but politely laugh it off."
"I wasn't allowed to say butt or ass. It was bottom. This continued until my teenage years. Shit, damn, and the well timed fuck was fine after age 13, but I would get lectured for butt."
Wow that's fucked up. They made you and they have the nerve to talk shit about your hair. I mean where do they think you got it from?
Bad hygiene. And it's not like that's a crazy standard or anything. Don't smell noticeably unpleasant and don't have offensive breath. 
"Not as drastic as some, but my mom - though the salt of the earth and an otherwise lovely person- always criticizes her body and is hyper critical of her appearance (and says so out loud). Interestingly, whenever I've been critical of myself, she tells me to snap out of it, that I'm beautiful, etc. Typical mom response. 

But then people always tell me I look like her? So if she thinks she's unattractive, does she feel the same way about me? If I have a daughter, I vow never to be as critical about myself in her presence as my mom has in mine. "
"What happened in the Pacific during WW2. I'm German and we basically have over a year of history classes dedicated to the topic, but it focuses very strongly on the European part. I think Pearl Harbor was mentioned briefly, as well as the atomic bombs, but nothing else. "
"The Trail of Tears. How Native Americans would create contracts with our government to give some parts of their land up in hopes that they could keep/live in some of it. But then white settlers came in illegally and our government did nothing to stop them. And if the Native Americans pushed back, the government would send in troops to fight against the ""savages"". They made contract after contract with us and we never kept our end of the deal. All inevitably leading to the Trail of Tears. One of the clearest moments in history where we were the obvious bad guys."
"They asked for my school schedule. And set a time I must come home by.  I live in a state where traffic is the same everyday if not it's worse. So they calculate what time based on the traffic I should be home by. 

So I started taking late classes + secretly went  and got a job. They weren't so thrilled to see me working but got 
angry and demanded that I should quit. (I started not listening to them 1 step at a time). 

I still didn't date until I was 22 years old, even then I kept it a secret. (Until they asked me to bring a guy home). 

Eventually they learn that I'm growing up and they can't keep me home forever. 

Unfortunately, there is a lot of secrecy in my relationship with my parents but that is just how things are. 
"
"""Oh my god thank god you're not gay!""

Said by my mother when I got my first boyfriend at about 13. Apparently I cut my hair and dressed ""dykey"" and it made her worried.

I like girls too. I never told her. Never introduced her to any girlfriends I had. She died last year never knowing and I'm glad I never told her. It helped me when I made my decision to not speak to her anymore. 

She also made super inappropriate comments about me sleeping with my boyfriends far before I lost my virginity. Like insisting I didn't have to lie to her and telling me I was full of shit when I told her I wasn't sleeping with my boyfriend when I was 13. Made me feel gross."
We have been married 36 years and it just gets better and better . We are a great team and we appreciate all the effort we have put in over the years to get to where we are today. We talk all the time. We look after each other. We have the same goals. We support each other in achieving goals and dreams. My husband has always shown his love for me in so many little ways. Even after all these years he still suprises me by cooking a nice meal for us or making sure I have a favourite drink when we go out somewhere. He will look at me in a certain way when we are out with friends and I can know exactly what he is thinking. He still makes me laugh. We don't take our love for granted. We know we are fortunate to still love each other as much as we do after 37 years together. 
"I had to wear a bra, large shirt and pants or long shorts around the house at all times. Why? Because it was ""inappropriate"" around my step dad and brother? Everything was fine for me I was comfy anyway but the bra rule was soo annoying. "
"oh god that is so slimy and weird. no wonder you both couldn't really put your finger on what was going on. how could your mom turn a blind eye to that?

well, my mom did lots of the same. so i know the answer. but still, i ask why."
"A friend of mine would shove off the question by saying that if she changed her mind, there were plenty of already-born children waiting for adoptive parents. "
"I wasn't allowed to say ""Oh man"". I got a pretty bad beating because I said it. I think they associated it with ""gangster culture"" or something (We're French-Caribbean so English is not our first language). "
"Buys me flowers or little thoughtful gifts for no reason.

Helps with housework without me asking.

Tells me he loves me.

Compliments me.

Says he's proud of me."
"As a shy introvert who suffers from general anxiety disorder I just really love being around someone who makes me feel like I'm at home no matter where in the world we live together. 

We've lived together in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, the U.K. and the Philippines and even in the most odd places in weird flats I feel like I'm home. 

He's my home. "
"Definitely. I casually saw a guy for two months, and really fell for him. He broke things off in a text message. We were never in a relationship, and my friends didn't really understand why I felt so heartbroken.

I think for me, it was because when he broke things off, it was like a door slamming shut. Because we weren't in a relationship, I never got to know the bad parts of him. I never got to know the areas in which we were incompatible. There was nothing I could point to and be like well, it's for the best we broke up, I never liked such-and-such about him. It was just happy butterflies of ""omg I really like this guy,"" and then those butterflies were slaughtered.

It made it harder for me to get over him. All those ""what-could-have-beens"" and daydreams still existed, with nothing to temper them."
"Kissing someone to make them stop talking. Fuck off, I'm not done chewing you out yet."
"what they wear to a first date. i don't know if it was my area or what, but the complete lack of effort was just appalling. 

like, by all means, don't pretend to be someone you're not, but for gods sake, you're supposed to be presenting your *best* self. simple swamps. saggy cargo pants for jeans. sandals for sneakers. witty graphic T shirt/bowling shirt with flames for plain T shirt in a good fabric. *please. i shaved for this*"

"When I was in college, my sister was in high school. She lost a lot of weight in a very unhealthy way, but my parents will thrilled at her new slim figure. She started getting attention from the ""popular crowd.""  I came home from school over a holiday and my sister mentioned that one of her longtime best friends was complaining about never seeing her - I guess my sister was ditching her for the new popular friends. I made some comment like ""Why aren't you hanging out with (longtime friend) anymore?""  My mom looks at me, with utter disgust, and goes ""Uh, Lindsiefree, look at (sister). Are you serious? She is not going to hang out with those people anymore.""  That was the first time I realized I hated my mother. "
"It's usually a really quick ""hey, would you go out with me?"" kinda thing where I'm pretty sure they're only partially serious, so I just smile, say no, and go on my way. 

One time, though, when I was drawing at a park, this 15 year old skateboarded up to me, started a conversation, then slid onto the bench next to me acting all suave. It was adorably hilarious, like watching a puppy learn to walk. When I realized he was not just making friendly conversation (I'm slow sometimes) I dropped my age, which he took in stride, so then I mentioned my husband. To which he said ""aw, man, you're married? Well, it was nice to talk to you!"" and skated off. 

Kid had game!"

Oh fuck no

Spitting.
"Their excuse was ""he can't get pregnant."" Uhhh he can get someone pregnant? Besides, all the sex I had was between 3 and 5pm when no one's parents were home."
"I went on one date with a guy who had been abused by his wife. 

She stabbed him in the stomach with a screwdriver, she broke his arm with a cast iron skillet. She attacked him while he was asleep. She tried to make him wreck their car (grabbed the steering wheel while they were on the highway). When they married, he told her that he *really* wanted children. She would taunt him with the idea (fact?) that she aborted the pregnancies they had together (I think he said 5?) They were married for 3 years and the abuse started on their honeymoon. When he sought help, he was mocked and laughed at. He was 6'3"" and she was 5' even.   

He divorced her while she was in prison for trying to  kill him and his sister.   
She WAS able to kill his brother-in-law.

His confidence was shot. He was completely broken. He was terrified of any woman who looked remotely ""hot"". (trust me, I'm not and I own it!) He had gained about 150 lbs. 

I was his first date after that nightmare.  
It didn't go well."
"For some reason we couldn't ride our bike on the street, but we could stay home alone at a young age and swim in our pool unsupervised. 

Needless to say nowadays when I ride my bike around the city I live in, I love to emphasize smugly to my mom that it was ON THE STREET. "
"Not necessarily sure if this is considered a trope, but it's aggravating nonetheless: 


Deserted island, medieval times, zombie apocalypse--miraculous lack of female body hair. "
Having really strong opinions without understanding why you have them. I once dated a guy who said that global warming was a liberal conspiracy. He became instantly unattractive. 
"There was recently a news article about a woman that discovered videos of her partner having sex with her as she slept, and he was thrown in prison for rape.

Ah here it is: [Man jailed after wife of 10 years discovered he had been raping her in her sleep](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/man-rape-wife-ten-years-sleep-sexual-assault-jailed-prison-newcastle-a7874806.html)"
"Oh mine did stuff like that too. Everytime I would get my results (and between age 6 and age 11, my results were always higher than 90%), their first reaction wasn't ""well done"" or ""it's good"" but ""How much did Thomas get?""...

Thomas was a little boy in my class, they kept calling my ""booooyyyyfrieeeend"", who was born the same day and the same year as me. So they would always compare our results and they would look disappointed when I had smaller results than him. Even when my results were 95%..."
"My mom once walked up to me with the car insurance bill in hand, pointing to the line that read, ""Good Student Discount - Removed"" and just gave me the most disapproving glare I'd ever seen. I still don't think she realizes how much lording my academic failures over me has damaged my self-esteem and contributed to my suicidal thoughts."
"My first long-term boyfriend (and still to this day the boyfriend I was the most in love with) had a fetish that literally ended up destroying our relationship. We dated for 2 and a half years and the issue kept popping back up to make us both feel bad and angry with each other. Essentially, this ex-boyfriend had a very strong ""rape fetish"" (as he called it). He fantasized about women being raped and degraded (and he consumed tons of live action porn and hentai depicting these acts to a very extreme level). To me, his fetish was moreso straight up misogyny than just ""power play."" It turned me off, disgusted me, and honestly scared me. I have been raped in the past (the year before I dated this particular ex,) and when he told me that he found porn rape scenes ""hot"" I felt sick to my stomach. I should have just dumped him when he told me his fetish, but I foolishly thought we'd get past it. Nope. 2 years and a bitter, resentful shitty sex life later, and I realize how much time I wasted! At least now I know that if that kink comes up again, I'll just end things because I clearly can't handle it. "
"In our native language, my mom would always call my older sister her ""gold"" and me her ""poop"". She meant it as a joke, but I think as I grew up I started seeing more and more examples of my sister being the ""golden child"" and me just being an afterthought.

I have a better job than my sister, I get better grades, I work harder, and my mom will still always favor my older sister no matter what. It led to a lot of resentment as I grew up."
"Questioning their life choices is a great idea!

""But veryfancyrats, what if you change your mind and want kids someday?""

""Hmm good point. You've got two kids -- what if YOU change YOUR mind and don't want them someday? If the timing works out, I can just take yours!"""
"I've been dating a guy for about 6 months and I hear all the time how beautiful I am and I am sick of it. It's become meaningless. He'll ask people we're in conversations with, ""isn't she beautiful?"". Should add, I've lost about 70 lbs over the last 2 years and have been really disgusted with how differently I'm treated. If I didn't feel so much healthier, I'd gain it back just to know who's real in my life. "
"Validating what I'm saying and feeling without adding ""but"" afterwards "
Being valued as people first and women second.
"Can I just say that wanting the baby over and finding ACTUAL school girls is not age play, that's pedophilia. They aren't the same and ageplayers aren't people who are attracted to children. And ageplay isn't always sexual. 

Not saying that's what you were implying, people just tend to assume that about ageplayers. "
"Realizing all my examples are actually pretty shitty, not innocuous. 

Like my mom telling 5-yo me: your stepmom is going to make your dad choose between her and you, and he is going to choose her.  Way to set me up for years of insecurity and conflict with stepmom. "

"My grandma tried this. I asked her ""When you gave birth in 1959 did you follow parenting tips from 1904?"" That worked."
"Holy shit. 

This basically is exactly why over the years I've never been that into presents. Or flowers. I've never dated someone who was good at presents in that thoughtful way, in that they listened to me and then decided on the basis of things I said what I might actually appreciate.

I laughed once at work when my colleagues asked if the guy I'm currently dating had sent me the flowers I received - I told them nobody who knows me well would send me flowers other than as a joke (which my best friend did once).  One time I was sick, though, it was a long weekend and the shops were all shut, and he went out on a trek to find me oreos. That's the kind of thing that makes me outrageously happy."
"This. So much. This.

 I asked my SO to take the laundry out of the dryer, assuming I wouldn't need to tell him to put it away because he's a smart and responsible individual, came home and he just threw it all on the couch :P
Kind of like raising a puppy."
"That is so fucking creepy. My dad would always make gross comments about how I should gain weight because he was not attracted to skinny women. He also took polls of the room regarding whether or not I had cleavage. He would literally ask my brothers and other relatives this question right in front of me, presumably to shame me for having small breasts. I have no idea what the fuck he was thinking."
"Congratulations!

I had a C section after dilating all the way and starting to push.

Some women love the mesh underwear. I hated them. I bought some giant granny panties several sizes too big and found them much better. It may be worth having them on hand.

Prepare food and freeze it now. The frozen lasagna and burritos I had on hand were so nice to have.

If you plan on nursing, buy more lanolin nipple cream than you think you could ever use. And breast pads. 

Have maxi skirts? I lived in them for a month. So comfy.

"I wish I'd learned more about the Japanese occupation in Korea. Only from fiction and Korean friends have I heard more about it, and it's fascinating (and horrible), but also completely helps put into context the animosity that still exists between the two. "
"My youngest brother got a kitten in June that I'm probably going to end up keeping because my parents are concerned he's taking way too many hours to take care of her and give her the attention she needs, and she's disgracefully adorable and sweet and follows me everywhere. Her nickname is Princess Underfoot. 

But her real name is [Lychee](http://imgur.com/v26Zfyg) and she's [***precious***](http://imgur.com/MjWvqtP). She likes hiding in [Fort Lychee](http://imgur.com/jBkQqVA) and [doing kitty things](http://imgur.com/e5QKkKZ). She's [comfy anywhere](http://imgur.com/LrnbsVy) as long as it's close to you, and she doesn't give a shit if you think she's [cross-eyed](http://imgur.com/sRMTadQ)."
"Mum always said she would pick us up no questions asked if we needed it which was good.

But she also did the major guilt trips about sitting up til 2am because she couldn't sleep if she knew we were out. We didn't even live near her at that point. "
"I'm hyper frustrated with this because I feel that he may have had some legitimate gripes but he's just such an ass about it.

Stripping away all the bullshit what I got (in a non inflammatory way) it that Google is making it a priority to hire women (good) but not addressing why women are leaving, or don't want to work there in the first place.

I personally would never work for Google. I was wholly unimpressed with my interview process and I have friends who work there that lead a life that I don't want to live at 33. I now work at another company where they spend a lot of time on programs that make me feel valued as a woman in tech. (Many volunteer days are given, there's a daycare right next to work, children are encouraged to be in the office, partnerships with groups like Girls Who Code, flexible work hours, etc.)

If Google hires women but doesn't address that there actually a significant amount of us that have different values than some men, they are not going to get the best female talent and they are not going to retain what they do get. (I don't have kids btw, but I like the option that if I did my company would support that.)

Their whole ""we'll freeze your eggs thing"" is a perfect example of how tone deaf they are. Like thank you for offering to freeze my eggs so that when you're done getting everything you can out of me, I'll be able to get them from a freezer and hopefully make them grow.

"Seconded. The people who were the most friendly/bubbly at my jobs were the ones I took the most seriously when their tones turned serious. Like, if you're a friendly happy person, it means business when you say things authoritatively, so I know to not fuck around."
"Our first teacher made us feel guilty af.

"often people find that they hate the enabler more than the abuser. the abuser is the blatant villain, the devil you know. the enabler pretends to be the good guy while willfully keeping you in danger and even maybe brainwashing/gaslighting you into accepting the abuse so they don't have to do anything about it.

fuck that!"

"Once around age 14 after I put on some makeup my mom said ""I never saw anyone walk into a bathroom looking so bad and walk out looking so good.""    
She meant well but I have never been able to go without makeup. I've been married 26 years now and still wear it around the house so my husband won't see an 'ugly' me.     
And I *know* he is 1) oblivious, and 2) doesn't give a rats's ass, and 3) I am not ugly.     
I just can't  :("
"Arrogant men who tell you how intelligent the are. If you have to keep repeating ""I'm an intelligent guy"" I'm going to think it's more a case of you trying to reassure yourself actually...

"One of my exes told me he had a pee fetish, and some other stuff. To be honest, I thought it was really weird (I was 18 or 19 at the time). But then he really started pressuring me to do these kinky things that I was not willing to do. He was my second sexual partner, and I had only had sex about five times. He wanted me to cut my pubes into a certain shape and then dye that tuft pink. Again, that's fine he was into that, but he would get very mad when I wouldn't want to. He wanted to use these huge, spiky/bumpy dildos and buttplugs on me. I never agreed, and I broke up with him. I guess I'm vanilla and maybe a bit prude, and I'm not sexually compatible with kinky people. But the pressure and anger was Red Flag City, USA. "
"I've been taking a casual survey for the past few years asking people what smell they find most attractive on member of the opposite sex. Men have told me all sorts of stuff, specific perfumes, flowers, spices, and all sorts of food smells ( the number of men who thinks their dream girl would smells like hot wings or chocolate pudding is slightly disturbing).  Almost every women I've asked has said one of three things: soap, laundry detergent, and shampoo. 

Because we've all smelled lots and lots and lots of men who neglect all three of these things.  "
"Be nice to his horrible, abusive, piece of shit family members. 

I don't want to be nice. I want tone terribly mean, give them a piece of my mind. But I know that will just make it worse for him. So I do it, until he says it's fine not to. "
I use to just shave daily and suffer the pimples since I have eczema as well. If you can afford it I would absolutely recommend laser hair removal it changed my life.
"First ex: Go with him, his parents, and younger brother to their aunt's house in the woods for Thanksgiving with ALL of us crammed into the front seat of a truck for the drive that took several hours. Also having to not show any reaction whatsoever when we were with his family for his graduation party and his grandma said something about ""for when you get to *college name*!"" and he had been lying to me about not knowing if he was accepted or where he was going.

Second ex: Family cookout I thought was going to be just me meeting his parents. He spent the whole time acting pissed at me because I was uncomfortable and not being super outgoing and conversational with his family. Another one about not reacting, this time was when he introduced me to someone with the name of another girl. 

Current SO: We were out to lunch with a bunch of friends in the city and the topic of exes came up because my First ex was also living in the city and someone mentioned having seen him. This led to several of us making little griping comments about our exes, but my SO decided to talk about how ""yeah with my ex I thought our relationship was perfect but she just up and left me and is married to a doctor now with twins."" I just kind of hid behind my chili cheese fries pretending my heart hadn't just shriveled up. "
"Also, all the older women in your family are about to start coming to you with outdated ideas on birthing and child rearing. Just smile and nod and go on and do what you were already planning to do. They mean well (but that doesn't make their unsolicited advice any less annoying)

It really isn't worth arguing about unless they want you to do something stupid or dangerous right in front of them or they will be caring for your child when you aren't around."
"I changed my mind about working in an office. I used to swear up and down that I'd never work a boring, lame, stuffy cubicle job because that would be *selling out,* man! 

Uh, yeah. Give me a steady schedule, benefits and contribute to my retirement any day of the week!

I don't think I will change my mind about not wanting kids, though."
"I'm bubbly and warm...and am an executive at a large company. Early in my career, I tried to tone down my natural inclination towards friendliness. I thought the only way I could command respect was to be a little cold. Long story short--it didn't work for me. The best thing I did for myself was to be genuine and trust my instincts, even when I didn't look, feel or sound like other executives. Kindness and respect CAN coexist. I always make sure that I'm committed to providing direct feedback when a staffer is disrespectful to me or a colleague. I deliver direct and honest feedback on performance, avoiding the ""sh*t sandwich"" method (I.e., ""you're really great but please stop doing x. But great work!""). I make no apologies for who I am."
"I know there was a study where they had two groups of girls take a math test.  Before the test, one group of girls was told, ""Now, girls don't really do well on this test, but just do your best,"" while the other group was told, ""This is a test girls usually perform really well at.""  The second group dramatically outscored the first group."
"At 11-14, I was bullied. I would have liked adults who witnessed it to help me. Or even acknowledge the fact that I was bullied. Instead, they pretended like everything was ok even though it clearly was not.  
  
Christ, being a kid sucked."
Violence and aggression. 
"I can't be as gross or as irresponsible. 

Leave food out but eat it the next day? Nope, he's like ""you'll get sick"". Eat ribs in bed? Nuh uh. Have something I need to be doing but I feel like playing games in my underwear? ""Isn't your deadline tomorrow?""

I mean, clearly most of those things make me a better person but damn if I don't want to be a garbage human sometimes."
Why would that info come out at a family dinner??
"Holy fuck, that's absolutely draconian. Also, they *asked* you to bring someone home? After all that? It's funny, in a way."
"God. The way my brother and I were parented in high school was so very different. I was 3 years above him in school and he had no rules, responsibilities or expectations after his freshmen year. I had more on me when I visited from college"
"I'm not a native English speaker and I don't use the PM/AM system to tell time. When I got together with my ex I sometimes got confused when he would tell me a specific time, both because he'd use AM/PM or say he'd say ""half nine"" and miss out on ""past"" to mean 9:30. The thing that meant a great deal was when he started texting me the time I needed to know in the 24 hour format instead. It just made my life so much easier and it was so nice of him to accommodate me in that way. "
"Anything you enjoy! Reading is great! Don't read things because you ""should,"" read about whatever interests you. "
That's kind of hilarious though
"When I was 18, fresh out of high school, met a guy online who lived in the next town over. Started with a little bondage, and that was fine by me. One day, while I was blindfolded, tied down, and gagged with a bandana, I felt cold metal on my skin. Didn't really think anything of it until I felt a burning pain on my right breast. This mother fucker cut me! I felt him put his mouth there, and I'm snapping my fingers (which is supposed to be a signal to stop what he's doing and untie me) but he's murmering about tasting my blood and making me his. So I bite his hair and pull my head back. He screams, rips off my blindfold and I think he saw rage in my eyes because he quietly apologized and undid the ties without me saying a word. I slapped him, he offered to let me cut him, I told him to fuck off and die, got dressed and left."
"Yep.  I got into a sexual relationship with my future husband knowing it would not last more than a month because that was when I planned to kill myself after that.

Instead, like some sappy bullshit movie, I found some happiness and decided against the whole suicide thing."
"I was really anti-marriage for a long time. I saw every adult couple in my family break up, get divorced etc. and had no good long-term relationship models. I said I didn't see the point in marriage, why go through all the extra bother just to make it even more of a pain when you inevitably broke up? And when I got into a long term relationship for myself, I didn't see the need to getting married because why do I need a piece of paper to validate my relationship?

What changed my mind though was my SO's father talking about when my SO's mother died (she died when my SO was very young) and how difficult it was for him because they weren't married. They had been together for over 10 years and had 3 children together, lived together, owned a house together etc. He said he thought they had sorted everything out legally before she died by laying it all out in her will but when she did die, apparently none of it was valid. Her life insurance didn't go to him, her spousal pension didn't go to him, her assets didn't go to him, even though all of this was apparently in the will. The family disputed it and took everything, leaving my SO's dad to raise 3 young boys by himself with hardly anything. He said he worried even his children would be taken because as it happens, his name isn't on any of their birth certificates, but he said no one disputed his custody. He reckons if someone from her family did though, he could have lost his kids too.

That seriously upset me and scared the crap out of me. I started looking into all the legal ramifications and benefits of marriage. And I slowly became convinced that if I were to have children, I would want to be married, just so if anything were to happen to one of us, it wouldn't be so catastrophic. I think (or I hope) the law has changed a lot now as cohabitation is a lot more common than it was 20 years ago, but I still worry that if I were to die tomorrow, my partner who I've lived with for 6 years wouldn't get anything (even though all my legal documents like pension, insurance etc. lists his name as the beneficiary)."
"I was pretty devastated when a FWB ended our sexual relationship. Earlier he'd told me he didn't want to date me, which was disappointing but hardly the end of the world, but knowing he didn't want to sleep with me anymore left me feeling gutted.

In my case, it came down to the (oft repeated on Reddit) stereotype that men will fuck virtually any available woman. I reasoned that if this particular guy didn't want to keep having sex with me, it must have meant that I was brutally ugly and undesirable."
"Go to church while we were visiting his parents + grandparents, which was a big one in San Antonio that brought politics into the service. I've been a filthy nonbeliever since I was in my early teens and his parents don't know. Not only am I now an atheist, but I was raised Jewish so I can't relate to Christian services all that well."
"My mum would constantly berate my father, like seriously rip him apart, call him subhuman shit, then if I ever upset her she would say I was just like my father.

It's such a tiny thing, and apparently she meant that we had the same sour face if we were annoyed. But it lead to me having extremely low self esteem because I took it literally.

EDIT: I feel I should add that they were separated, later divorced, and when my dad would visit they would have screaming rows and sometimes physical fights. So that's partly why it affected me so badly. I didn't want to be like that. I still don't."
"Well, after reading this thread it turns out none of my parents rules were ridiculous. "
"Long nails= he hasn't spent a lot of time fingering women, and he certainly won't be coming home with me, cause those fingernails aren't coming anywhere near my body."
"Monogamy vs. non-monogamy, having kids vs. childfree, pets, moving for careers, any past trauma and serious relationships, wanting to get married or not, and political opinions. "
"My SO was stabbed in the gut by a previous girlfriend and refused to press charges because she 'didn't mean it.' She was a manipulative, toxic person that did her best to systematically destroy his self esteem. 

The lingering effects of her abuse are his poor self esteem and conflict avoidance. He's afraid of being yelled at (her screaming fits were legendary) and in his mind arguing = screaming. If I disagree with him, he will immediately apologize and change his opinion to match mine.

Therapy has been a very important part of our relationship. I want him to feel like he can talk to me and trust that I'll to listen to what he's saying. I want him to feel safe with me. But at the same time, I can't be the keeper of his mental health. It's a tough thing to balance.

He's getting better but I think he'll probably always be dealing with the aftermath of her abuse."
"Exactly, being a ""nice guy"" to women for the sake of getting with women will not earn you any points but if you are a genuinely good person people will notice and that will attract other good people. "
I think my vagina would clench shut if I heard that during sex. The incestuous connotation is disgusting to me.
"I hear what you're saying, but I also agree with it."
"Oh, plenty. 

-Being told I only got into college because of my skin color

-Being told that my name is ""ghetto"" (my name is Christina) 

-Being told that my fiance won't really know if our child is his because he's white and I'm not 

-While house hunting, lots of homes were ""unavailable"" when I inquired about them, yet were suddenly available when my (white) fiance inquired about them at the same time 

-Hearing people say that black women are ugly and disgusting

-Being told that naturally curly hair looks better on white people

There are more, but these are the ones that stick out the most. "
"The nurses showed us how to open up a diaper, put ice in it and tape it back shut. I used it against my groin as an ice pack. Best part is it never leaked because the diaper absorbed the water as it melted. Use stool softeners cuz it might hurt to poop for a week or two. Spray your privates with the numbing spray they give you at the hospital. Spray it like it's aqua net and you're living in the 1980s. 
Nipple shields if you breastfeed. Nipple gel pads help too.  Put them in the freezer before sticking them to your nipples. Don't be afraid to supplement with formula or even formula feed exclusively. A fed baby is a happy baby. 

"
"Anything that involves spending time with his family, which sometimes means spending the entire weekend with them. It's not that they're bad people, it's just that they're...mean. They laugh at people who might look a little different (goths, homeless people, eccentric old ladies with crazy make up etc) and they find it hilarious that I prefer to read than watch TV, for some reason. And I can't use bad language for the whole weekend, which is prolly the worst bit. "

Also homophobic, talks trash about my boyfriend, always tries to impress me by repeating things he saw on almighty TV, including things about mathematics, which he doesnt understand even a little bit, and still contradicts me when I try to explain why he's wrong."

"Absolutely.  It is pretty damn common.

"Yep, me too. It wasn't even an option I would have ever considered. You can't just *not* go to college, that's ridiculous. Like brushing your teeth every day. First you go to kindergarten, then elementary school, then middle school, then high school, then college. That's what life is. 

And it wasn't just my parents - I grew up in an affluent town where most people's parents had college degrees and EVERY single person I knew in high school had plans to go to college. It was the track laid out for them. The main question everyone was asking each other toward high school graduation was ""What college are you going to?"" No one would have ever thought to ask ""Are you going to college?"" because it never crossed anyone's minds."
"Well, it was my mom and stepdad.  I apparently got my hair from my father but he split after the divorce.  

But it still seems like common sense that there should be something they could do to make my hair look better.  I remember several of my mom's friends made comments at one time or another and my mom just refused to listen to them.  Her best friend once suggested I get a straightening iron and my mom insisted they'd tried one and it ""didn't work"" which was a complete lie."
"My mom was really religious so I wasn't allowed to eat meat unless I snuck it with my dad, I couldn't read Harry Potter or LoTR or anything like that because of the magic, I wasn't allowed to wear make-up around her or dye my hair until I was already a year into high school. Plus, I was responsible for doing EVERY chore/cleaning in the house. 

It was all silly. "

"I don't know. :( I recently told a guy I've been friends with for over a year and eventually fell for *hard* that I had feelings for him. He (very gently) told me he didn't feel the same. Of course I put on a smile and told him, ""Ok that's fine! Hope we can still be friends!"" But I could literally feel my heart breaking. The first few days after felt horrible and I couldn't stop crying. But now, it's been a few weeks, and while I'm not constantly crying like I did those first few days, there will still be moments throughout the day where I hear a certain song, go to a certain place, etc. that remind me of him and the fun times we had together. And during those moments, it feels just as painful all over again. 

Of course I tell my friends about this, and they've overall have been *super* helpful. Except when they still go, ""Ohh don't worry, your heart didn't get broken :D"" just because I didn't actually *date* him. Or some tell me that the pain shouldn't be as bad since it's not like we were ever in a relationship. And I think that's another reason why it's been sort of hard for me to get over it. Because I feel like I shouldn't feel any pain over this rejection, so I find that I try to bottle in my feelings more than I should in fear of ""making too big of a deal"". So to answer your question OP, I thought it was possible, but now I have no idea :(

EDIT: And what makes it harder is how *stupid* I feel for legitimately thinking he may feel the same, since he was pretty flirty too during our friendship (calling me attractive, making dirty jokes, 'suggesting' we date and I meet his family, etc.)"
I was diagnosed with MS about 6 months or so before we met and I have to take shots for it three times a week.

Words can only say he loves me... this proves he does.

Will never change my mind: kids. I do not want them. The mere thought of being a mom fills me with the most intense soul crushing dread I've ever experienced, and it has only gotten more intense with age, so I'm pretty sure I've reached the age now where I can say that kids are not for me and never will be. I'm less scared of dying than becoming a mom... Despite genuinely liking other people's kids. "

"I haven't been in a relationship, but I feel like I'll be similar to him if I ever end up in one. 

My only sexual experience is from a female friend of mine taking advantage of me when I was 17. Ever since then, I feel incredibly anxious about the mere thought of sex or physical intimacy and have even had panic attacks about it. I'm concerned that having this emotional barrier will be a real issue for anyone who ends up with me.

It's reassuring to know there are people as understanding as you out there. Thanks for sharing.  "
"Sometimes I just want to lay in bed by myself in the pitch black and not be touched while watching Netflix for hours. I'm not mad at you, I'm not annoyed, you've done nothing wrong, I'm fine and I'm not down about anything. And I'm sure after I've had my time alone I'll be all over you again, but for now I just want to lay. Sometimes it's just like that. It seems that when you live with an SO, it's hard to get them to understand this. They either think you're mad at them and want to try and fix whatever is wrong or they think you're down about something and want to try and fix that. No matter how much you tell them otherwise. So it seems like I never can do that. "
"When I was in high school (16 or 17) my parents went on vacation for a week during the summer and left my brother (19) and I alone. 

As they are at the door leaving, my mom says, ""well, you know the rules when we're gone...""

I'm expecting her to say ""no parties, no boys, etc""

Instead, she says, ""no deep frying""

I've never deep fried anything on my own in my life so it was an odd thing to say. Most things I cooked in high school were in the microwave.

The best part is my brother came home from work one night and said ""man I'm craving chicken burgers... wanna deep fry?"" 

He hadn't been around when my mom was telling the rules which made it way funnier. 

Tl;Dr parents left my brother and I home alone as teens, told us the only rule was no deepfrying. Being the badass kids we are, we deep fried  "

I guess I just don't see the point in being bitter. If someone's a jerk I just write them off and move on. I'm really good at compartmentalizing (it could be argued I'm too good) so while it might sting a little (I'm also prideful) ultimately it's meaningless in my life and I move on. Bitterness about it is only allowing assholes to live rent free in my head and I just don't have enough fucks for that. 
"Well, my childhood was filled with kids not wanting to play with me because of my skin color, calling me chocolate and teachers not doing anything about it. A teacher even told me that when I grew up I could dye my hair blonde to be pretty like them.

It finally stopped when I changed schools to one with more people with my skin color.

Nowadays the only demonstrations of racism I get are people not wanting to go out with me because they don't date girls with my skin color, and store employees following me everywhere because they think I'm going to steal even when other people (white and blonde) are stealing *right there*. Ugh.

There might be some other stuff I get but I forget about them soon enough. 

Oh, when I started dating my (white) SO I was told ""oh so you upgraded. Although your ex definitely matched your skin better"" what the fuck. Never spoke to that person again."
You aren't a prude for not wanting to do stuff like that.
"I think at that age I just wanted an adult to take my views and interests seriously. At that age I was starting to define who I was and what I believed in, and so many of the adults I encountered rolled their eyes at my opinions and interests and would respond essentially with ""Well, you just don't understand because you're a kid. This is just a phase."" I just wanted someone around who would listen to me and have a discussion instead of going straight to ""I'm big and you're little. I'm right and you're wrong."""
"So my last boyfriend asked me out in March when he knew I would be leaving the country (probably forever) in September. We were mad about each other during the brief month we were a couple but we knew it must come to an end, so I broke it off early to save us worse heartbreak down the line when it was going to end anyway. I promised not to cry. I cried because I knew we were perfect for each other in every way (ignoring the whole ""different countries"" business).

Of course because such things never end neatly we're still very much in love with each other and we met again the other week at a mutual friend's engagement party. The universe is a cruel mistress sometimes so I'm going to be the bridesmaid at that wedding and he's going to be the best man.

"My dad once told me that we all better hope he passes before my mother because without her, he would be good as dead. It was meant to be a loving statement.

My mom has always been very, very healthy her entire life. She was the head of the household in many respects and honestly, we all figured that my dad would pass before my mom just because of that impressive health consistency. 

Mom was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia a while back. Major cognitive decline, conversations barely make sense, and my dad has been a solid for her throughout it all. It's been a rough road.

But now, watching the two of them interact, I realize just how honest my dad was being when he said that so many years ago. I have seen countless moments where a silent, single tear drops down his cheek as he converses with the woman he's loved since high school in a manner that caters to word salad and reassurances. This is a man who prior to the past few years, had only cried twice in front of me.

He's scared, we are all sad, and witnessing his grief is almost worse than experiencing my own."

"I wouldn't be surprised if he had videos. He told me plain as day that he had videos and pictures of his exes that he would never, ever delete. He even had 2 different super encrypted hard drives for backup, just in case. I'd asked him to delete everything of me when I broke up with him, but they were his property since I sent them to him? 

Long story short I have a restraining order against him because of his harassment and stalking me at home/school/work after the breakup and then a stupid engagement/promise ring he sent me in the mail. I'd prefer to never think of him again. My fiancé and family know about him but otherwise he never existed. "

"He posted in a chat room that nobody would ever want to marry him. I'd never spoken to him before, and I thought twice about replying but ultimately decided I would. I said nobody would want to marry me either.

We've been together for 17 years now. "
"I try to look for the positive in things as much as I can. Got stuck at work late? Sucks, but at least I'm earning overtime. Caught in traffic? The worst, but at least it gives me time to blast that new song I'm obsessed with. Have cramps and can't get out of bed? Perfect opportunity to binge watch Jane the Virgin! Messed up at work? At least I learned what not to do next time.

It does nobody any good to listen to me complain, but it seems to cheer other people up to hear the plus side to stuff. So rather than say, ""This has been the shittiest week, I'm exhausted!"" I'll say, ""Oh thank God it's Friday, it's going to be gorgeous weather and I'm looking forward to the break."" I started doing it consciously to fight off negative thoughts caused by depression; now it's almost automatic. 

I'm not feeling inwardly cheerful all the time. But I do my best not to bring other people down, at the very least, and injecting positivity into my interactions with others tends to rub off on my own mood and lift me up. "
"I thought it was pretty damn good.  It kept enough of the typical spy movie tropes to meet expectations, but subverted enough to keep you on your toes.  We've got the well-dressed spy with the signature drink, who uses their good looks to their advantage.  Add in the sexy love interest and the good-looking wild card of dubious merit for good measure.  I liked the fact that she used her femininity to her advantage, such as using her stilettos as a weapon and her lingerie to hold a wire in place.  

I also think it's a good response to people talking about a female James Bond.  Nothing against those who want it, but I personally believe that it's better to have a new character (and maybe franchise?) stand on her own merit, rather than relying on gender-swapping a household name.  Best case scenario with a gender-swap, assholes will automatically discredit it by saying it's an unoriginal concept, or a cash grab, etc.  Worst case scenario, a poorly-written gender swap actually will be an unoriginal cash grab, which will discredit it even worse. I liked that people saw Atomic Blonde based on its own merit, rather than because of brand loyalty."
"Holy shit do I feel this one. I have super thick and curly European hair. I'm not adopted however my mom has fine wavy hair, and my dad had my hair type before balding, and he had it short and always slicked back, so he had no idea how to deal with longer hair. He was always threatening that he'd have my hair cut very short if I couldn't take care of it. I had constant tangles and would sob because I was so tender headed and my mom would just try to tear through my tangles with a comb and only brush my hair with a soft bristle brush. Thank the tech gods for the internet because I finally learned the right way to care for it and that not brushing it out when dry is normal. I'm really sorry you had to go through that, especially what happened when they adopted your sister."

"I dated a guy who had a giant foot fetish, like he asked if he could cum on my feet or if I'd give him foot jobs and what not. it's definitely not that bad except for the fact that I hate feet, especially my own, which he knew. I felt like absolute shit because I didn't know in the beginning of our relationship and during a game of 20 questions (ah, high school) he asked me if I'd rub a guy's dick with my feet and I thought it was a joke so I told him ""ew no jesus christ I'd vomit"" 😭 

after a while I decided I would try it because it seemed to be really important to him, but it wasn't my thing. I told him that I'm sorry but I don't think I can do it again, which he claimed to understand at first but he constantly begged for me to do it again until I broke up with him. I realized we were incompatible, he may have been the foot guy but I was definitely not the foot gal. "

there were times where i would be out with the older sibling, and she would get a call from her dad demanding she get home right away because the younger sister was in trouble for whatever. the typical offenses were lying about something, incidents at school, talking back etc. 

i recount this as my first understanding that parents are still just adults with fucked up ideals, and that having kids doesnt necessarily turn you into a person with morals. "
"My mom refused to let me go out in shorts, she was obsessed with he fact that people might take me for a prostitute (It started when I was 11), except maybe in summer holidays when we went camping.

Should I buy her a care package? Should I take her to a spa? Should I wash her feet?"" All of those things are really nice things to do in general (except maybe the feet thing, that's weird) and I know they're just trying to be thoughtful and nice, but the opposite of being grossed out by the normal bodily process of menstruation isn't to show you're oh-so comfy with it and end up treating her like a wilting flower. It's just to pick up a box of tampons at the shop without complaint when she texts you that she's out. "

"Yes, I did. It was a long time ago, and he wanted to explain my ""quirks"" to them and how it wasn't that bad to be with me (since he also has ADHD and Asperger's, like me). But I have way more mental illnesses than that so it backfired horribly.

And then I felt horrible for a while because I was okay with him sharing I had ADHD and Asperger's - but not my other illnesses, since I imagine your kid telling you he's dating a girl with recently diagnosed BPD isn't going to be okay with most people."
"Three reasons, I think.  One, ""creepy"" has an element of threat to it, someone is creepy when you feel unsafe around them.  Men are less likely to feel unsafe around a woman, even if she is acting super weird/violating boundaries/etc., because that woman is unlikely to be a physical threat to them (unlike in the reverse situation).  Obviously, there are exceptions, but I think in general a woman has to do more in order for a man to perceive her as a threat than the other way around.   

Secondly, girls and women tend to get more social education and have social rules more strictly enforced from the time they're very young.  The reinforcement is so strong that certain personality/mental disorders are under diagnosed in women/girls because we're punished harshly for not being socially ""normal"" from a young age.

Three, there seems to be a linguistic difference.  Even when a woman is being creepy and the guy does feel threatened, ""creepy"" is unlikely to be the word he uses to describe her.  Crazy, weird, desperate, etc, etc...  "
"My job involves a relatively large amount of interactions with teenagers, so this isn't infrequent for me. It's awkward. They know roughly how old I am, but they seem to not understand that there's a world of difference between an 18/19 year old and someone in her late twenties, so it's like they see me as their peer. I have to put up the barriers and make it that I am *not* their peer and it's inappropriate for our interactions to be anything but professional more often than my older coworkers, which is pretty annoying."
How did they enforce it at college? Did you just ignore their rule?
"Sounds very like my situation, so glad to hear he's doing better.

My SO would literally not be able to sleep if he thought he'd disappointed me. Even if I wasn't actually upset - just maybe something like he'd over cooked dinner a little. It just ate him up with guilt because he'd been programmed to believe he was a bad person. 

I found the best way through was being open, calm, loving, patient and kind. He slowly started to open up about it (I didn't know about the abuse until about a year into our relationship, even though we'd been close friends through the 3 years of the abusive one) and we worked through it slowly. Takes time but it's worth it. 

Honestly I hope she's grown and become a better person too. I'm certain that abusers and bullies are miserable and broken people deep inside and that sucks. No one should have to feel so shit about themselves that they take it out on someone else. Being the aggressor doesn't mean you're not suffering yourself."

There was no calling to let my mom know I would be late, i should just assume that I was grounded. Waking up my step-dad with a phone call would get me kicked out (to my dad's). I usually just told them that I was out with a group and would sleep at a friend's house just to not deal with the hassle. 

This pissed my dad off to no end because back then I didn't have a cell phone, nobody ever knew where I was and he resented being used as a punishment. For Christmas my senior year he gave me a cell phone if for no other reason than to be able to make plans that didn't involve fighting with my mom. He did make my phone number a long distance call for her though..."

In response, President Andrew Jackson is quoted as saying ""John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it,"" basically completely disregarding the entire Judicial branch's authority. Cut to the Trail of Tears and centuries of native oppression.

So that's fun."

"Regardless of what else anyone thinks is going on in that memo, the author makes an argument that women will never enter tech that centers in part on biological essentialism, using as ""proof"" the idea that biological males who are raised as girls still ""act like"" boys.

"Most recently, I was upset that my husband promised to take me on a date to the water park and he hadn't for the second weekend in a row. I started catching up with a friend I haven't seen since high school. She casually mentioned that her husband was less abusive now and mostly left her and her son alone. Turns out her husband is financially abusive to the point they live in poverty because he won't stop spending money on luxuries instead of paying the electric bill, verbally abusive, but she thinks that's normal because she grew up with it, and physically abusive when she tries to stand up for herself or hides money for necessities.

I spent all evening talking to her, and we came up with a plan to help her leave. I held my husband so tight."

Then I remembered that I would *totally* have hooked up with a 28-year-old woman when I was 18. Because: a) in my mind, I was totally as mature as them b) I've always found women way more attractive the closer they are to middle age c) they have way more experience... 

But now that I'm  the older one? I'm like: a) Oh god you're 18, I was such a dumb shithead at that age, b) You literally look like a child, no thanks c) I don't want someone who's just going to lie there like a dead fish while I do all the work "

"I'm a guy, so take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt, as there may be other, more sexist, issues driving why some treat you different than your male colleagues.

I haven't ever been described as 'bubbly', but I'm outgoing, I like to laugh, and tell funny stories. I'm not interested in changing those aspects of my personality, and I greatly value a work environment that allows me to be like that. Having said that, I've often wondered if I would be more respected if I were more reserved. Here's what I've found works for me.

Continue to do excellent work. Results pretty much speak for themselves, and establishes you as competent. Regardless of your personality type, being regarded as competent is the first and most necessary step.

Be assertive in asking for and taking on leadership positions, even if they are small at first. It helps if you have a mentor who can grease the skids here to get you those opportunities. This does a couple things. First, it gives you a history of managing small tasks and groups of people. Whereas you've previously established your technical competence, this allows you to establish your leadership competence. Again, think small at first. The second thing it does is gives you the chance to make tough, leadership-level decisions. The best thing I ever had to do for my career was kick someone off a project. It was hard for me, because I like being nice, but that experience taught me that leadership requires being able to do the hard, person-level things. It also showed people that while I like being nice, I am willing to make the right decision, even when it's hard, when necessary. I've been told that gained me a lot of respect.

I touched on this a little bit in the prior paragraph, but establish a relationship with a mentor who is a level or two above you on the food chain. There are two people where I work that I know I can talk to about any career concerns. I don't take up a lot of their time, but when I need something, they'll help me. In addition to providing me with great advice, they also help my reputation because people associate me (someone they may not know), with them (someone they probably know and definitely respect). Also, I have a good relationship with my mentors, so they say nice things to me to other people in leadership. Although this may be controversial, I would caution against restricting yourself to just looking for female mentors. A female mentor would be great, especially for navigating the sexism-related issues, but if there's someone where you work whose career path most closely resembles what you want yours to look like, don't shut yourself off from that opportunity just because of that person's gender (also, you can have more than one mentor). I've had both female and male mentors, and my criteria for selecting a mentor has always been whether or not I thought their experiences could help me, not what's between their legs. I only mention this because I witnessed at a prior job a group of women who would only mentor or be mentored by other women; that group became so insular that they closed themselves off from other opportunities that existed outside of their group. And finally on this note, don't wait to be approached by someone who wants to mentor you; ask! Be assertive; that speaks well for your character, and helps ensure you find someone you like.

Regarding the interns, you need to treat them differently. They aren't your peers, and shouldn't be treated as such. Not always, but oftentimes, interns assume a lower level of formality, because you're friendly, may be closer in age to them, or because it's the environment that they are used to. I have very high expectations for my interns, but I also spend a lot of time with them, trying to help them achieve it (they don't always). But I always keep a distance; sometimes that changes once they're no longer my intern, but when they are, I make expectations both high and clear.

Finally, don't change who you are. Confidence comes from being your truest self, so be that person. You don't have to be less bubbly, or tell fewer self-depreciating jokes, to have greater confidence or to succeed in the workplace. We can always improve who we are (getting better at reading a room can let us know if our self-deprecating jokes are too much, or if a more serious tone is required in specific circumstances), but you can't flip a switch and become a new person. Think of all these things as new (or improved) tools that you're adding to your toolbox, not that you're having to throw everything away and start anew."

My dad had taken me to the drug store earlier that day, where I'd very excitedly spent my allowance on a bright red Wet N Wild lipstick. I was in the car with my mom, and we'd just pulled up somewhere, and I whipped out my new lipstick to apply, which felt so cool, because that's how the girls on TV did it, and she recoiled in horror and made that comment.  
It took me YEARS to get into/figure out make up because I just associated so much shame with it. To this day, I really only wear neutral lipsticks, too. "
"It's a power thing.  

Men are more likely to be in a position of power, either socially or physically.  Plus, women are still often trained to be ""nice"", which often emboldens men to try things.  

The scale is tipping.  Women are now in a position to be creepy more than ever before, though it's still a lopsided effect.  Women are more likely to be seen as ""crazy"" than ""creepy"", but they are closely related things."

"I'm into sex but definitely ID as a sex-negative feminist. I feel like too often, sex-positive discourse comes from a position of assuming sex is good, and that doesn't allow enough room for asexuals, people who have had not-good or traumatic sex they don't want to label as rape, and the gray areas where sex isn't necessarily empowering and great and pleasurable. Plus in my experience the mainstream conception of sex and its connotations of violence and dominance is harmful and needs a lot of deliberate thought and confrontation to deal with.

In addition to that, so much of 'sex-positive' culture comes off as encouraging women to enjoy things they don't experience positively, assuming that's it's prudishness or something that's keeping them from liking whatever it is their partner wants from them.

Edit: Another thing is that sex positivity centers around consent above all, but there's little conversation about our deeper motivations and other things that might motivate consent even when we don't really want something. There have been plenty of times where I have consented to sex I didn't want because it would give me something I shouldn't depend on sex for, whether that's validation or to make my partner feel good or to lay my conscience at rest. My partners in those cases weren't raping me and had no way to know that I didn't want to be there. Though overall I think this emphasis on choice/consent is a general fault of liberal feminism."

"I could not follow the plot for the middle 40 minutes of the movie and thought the film would have been much more enjoyable with a runtime of 90 minutes. Also, I found it irritating what happened with the French agent -- in lingerie, no less -- what a dull, careless cliche. But the writing was full of cliches -- ""I'll have to be careful never to tell the truth again. It's going to get me killed one of these days."" And there was very little sense of place beyond some pop songs and James McAvoy yelling ""I love Berlin!!!"" 

However, the fights and stunts were very entertaining! If they had had a better script I'd have been all in on the visuals. The director should go see Baby Driver and take notes. "
Absurd. Also hilarious.

"My dad was the opposite - told me I couldn't dress in slim fitting clothes at all.

During late middle school/high school, he would go so far as to buy me clothes that were baggy and masculine...really baggy straight leg Levi's, big sweaters and tee shirts, and narry a spaghetti strap in sight - which reminds me, I also had to wear a bra and talk top under all my shirts. 

Luckily I started staying at my moms house a lot more and she took me shopping for normal teenager clothes. 

Ironically, I remember a little later my dad asked me if I was a lesbian (I am not a lesbian) because of my clothes - like he didn't realize he was trying to dress me as a lesbian? He would say all sorts of weird, critical shit like that. Idk what goes through his head sometimes, lol. "

"I'm sorry you went through rape and then had to endure this man's fetishization of it. Good that you learned it's a kink/fetish you never want to deal with, and there's not a damned thing wrong with not handling it. 

It's a mystery to me why we as a society look with horror at men who brutalize women but not those who do it in a sexual context. ""I like watching women suffer"" is hateful, but we're all A-OK with anyone who says, ""I get *sexually aroused* watching women suffer?"" We can't analyze that or unpack it in any way or differentiate it from abuse because it might kink-shame? Bullshit. 

You don't need a reason or justification to find it repugnant if a partner finds hating and degrading women ""hot."" "

"OH THIS HAPPENED TO ME ONCE.

I was 23 or 24 years old and I was hired to play in the band for a high school choir concert. I was the only person that they had hired; everybody else in the band were students attending that school. 

I look young. I know that. Everybody tells me that all the time and it's really fucking annoying. So, these teenagers that I was playing in the band with thought that I was also a high school student. And I didn't catch on to that until one of them started getting a little too cozy with me.

 It was the third day of rehearsal, and we had gotten to know each other a bit already and were friendly with each other. I was sitting at my piano bench, just messing around while waiting for rehearsal to start. One of the students sat on my bench next to me to chat. Already, I'm suspicious of where this is going. Suspicions confirmed when I said something only mildly amusing and he leaned over to bump shoulders mid-laugh.

Oookay, I'm getting up to get some water. 

Later, he asked me why he's never seen me before and if I go to this school.  
""...no.""  
""Oh. What school do you go to?""  
""I don't go to school.""  
""Oh. Homeschooled?""  
"".........""  
""What are you then?!""  
""I'm a college graduate. I do this for a living.""  
He looked shocked and mortified. ""Wait, how old are you??""  
""23.""  
""Ohhhh........""

And then he wasn't nearly as friendly anymore after that. Not that he was rude to me, but I think he was just incredibly embarrassed and couldn't face me anymore."

"I have PCOS so I have no choice but to shave really. 
I exfoliate before hand in circular motions with a soft face brush and sensitive/moisturising face wash or shaving balm (beard balm from lush is great!)
Then I rinse and use the face brush again to gently work up a lather using the same product and shave with the grain. Then rinse, lather, shave against the grain. Then I rinse my face with cold water to close the pores and apply moisturiser before my face fully dries. If I'm feeling sensitive or dry I'll use a moisture intensive serum like something aloe or snail based on the area I shaved. 
Since this routine I very rarely get pimples or ingrown hairs. 

I think the trick is exfoliating to remove dead skin and bring any little hidden hairs to the surface, and not over moisturising with something oily or thick that will clog you up. "
"People never actually hate each other. They actually love each other but don't know it yet.

I love my friends, but we're lucky if we can coordinate our schedules once a month to all be in one room at the same time."
I dated a guy who thought it was so sweet of himself to warm my side of the bed for me while I washed my face. I loved that he even thought of that so I made sure to tell him how sweet I thought it was. He was such a romantic.

"I read a really cute story (I think on Reddit) about a girl that was raised by her single father. She wanted to get her legs waxed for prom and her dad approved but said she could not get her thighs waxed. She found out years later that he had gone to the salon first and gotten his own legs waxed to see what she was going to be experiencing. When they waxed his thighs it was super painful and left him some bruising. So he didn't want his daughter experience that; hence the rule.
