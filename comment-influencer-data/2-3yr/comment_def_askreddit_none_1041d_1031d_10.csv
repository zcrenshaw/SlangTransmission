Yeah now is def the time to ask her out
"My Mom def regrets my name. She named me after her favorite aunt that had died a few years before I was born. The wound was too new and no one wanted to call me by her name. My middle name is Mackenzie after the beer dog Spuds Mackenzie, my dad got to pick that one out. He lied to her and said it was after his 'irish heritage'. So I get called by a name that is not on my birth certificate."
