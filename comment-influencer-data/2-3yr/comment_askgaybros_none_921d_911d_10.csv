""Young professional here. Not into the scene or games. Drama free. I take good care of myself and expect the same of you. Masculine guy looking for the same. Won't respond if feminine or out of shape. Only go for white guys, maybe the occasional Mexican -- sorry, just a preference. Old guys stay away. So SICK of the gay community and all the pettiness and vanity!! Where are all the good, sane, normal guys???? I think I'm a total catch, so why are all the people I meet on here ugly creeps??""
"
Police. Now. Sexual assault is not something to play around with.
Maybe. I also feel that gay men tend to start late in other things too like dating and emotional maturity. These things are subjective to the individual experience. 
"Am I the only gay guy in the Midwest?!? (Masc only thirst post pls and thanks)

Am I the only guy who likes muscular, masculine white men?!?! (My tastes are unique)

Am I the only gay who doesn't fit in the with other gays?!!?? (Other gays are stupid and gay lol)

Am I the only one whose extreme sarcasm has bled into a very real inability to connect with my emotions on a genuine level, to the point where I'm having an existential crisis about my lack of willingness/ability to engage in reality so I retreat into reading plays inspired by the Theater of the Cruel while hoping my antidepressants kick in soon?!?!?!? (Only Hanoch Levin knows my pain XD)"

Hire gay actors who are attracted to each other. The lack of passion is ridiculous.
"Both extremes are unappealing to me. Like with most things in life, somewhere in the middle of the spectrum is ideal. I prefer guys who are more laid back, but I don't want someone who's a slob either."
People keep thinking it's a dating app. It's a casual sex app which has a small chance of leading to dating. I don't get the hatred of it
Over-attachment to his fucking cell phone.

"It's not weird at all. Not speaking for him, but I would imagine that all he really wants is a guy that likes him for who he is. He doesn't want the money to get in the way, so he doesn't mention it. "
"""I know very little about HIV""

"Avoidance is the best course of action on apps. Those settings are impersonal, and rejections are frequently responded to with hostility. It's in the rejecter's best interest to just ignore.

"You need to tell your BF immediately, the longer you keep this incident from him the worse it'll be when he finds out. people who think they can handle situations like this on their own quickly realize how wrong they are.

After telling your BF you need to tell your friend that you don't appreciate his advances and that he needs to discuss how to satisfy his needs with his wife.  "
"I was raped by my ex , so i know how you feel.


1) Calm Down and breath.



2) Call a family member or a friend so a person you can trust can be with you.



3) Call the police Right now, If you let this pass believe me it will destroy you for a long time.



Its not your fault, Its his, Everything will be ok. "

"Go to a hospital and inform the doctor that you were raped by your date and would like to report this incident to the police. They will call the police and have them come to the hospital for investigation. The hospital may have a sexual assault department so they might refer you there for further consultation with a specialist RN/NP/MD.

This sounds like the plot of a shitty lifetime movie 
"We were walking around his neighborhood one night, and a drunk driver drove up the curb and almost hit me, he grabbed me and threw me into the bushes on the other side of him, and got in front of me. The car missed him, and I said ""are you fucking crazy? You could've gotten killed"" his response? ""I couldn't let you get hurt, I like you too much. So I figured the only thing I could do was get in the way"" and that's when I knew, how many other people in the world would do something like that?"

"Don't think of the activity itself in regards to this. You think video games are dumb, some people think sports are dumb, some people think theater is dumb, everyone likes different things.

He invested 4 years into this. 4 years is a long commitment to anything. Example that may sound more relatable: An artist has been working on an elaborate painting for hours on end, but someone spilled something on it. He is hysterical because of the time and effort put into it left nothing to show. Now imagine if someone came by and said ""it's just some drawings."" If I were the painter, I would probably just flat out punch the person in the heat of the moment."

What's probably different between me and the guy you replied to is that I then pushed the piss back out onto another guy's face while he rimmed me. The dude was really into piss play and loved it. 

I've done some weird shit."
"1) You are 17, you are about to experience constant and rapid personal change for the next 5-10 years of your life. Anything you think you want right now is probably going to change in that time.

2) There are only two things that are certain right now: your attraction to boys, and the longer you repress those feelings the worse you will feel. 

3) Don't waste your best years being a damn priest. Stay religious if you want, but go study something you enjoy that can be turned into something useful after college. 

4) Ask yourself, will your family disown you, or kick you out if they find out you like boys? If the answer is yes, ask yourself, what would compel them to do that? If the answer to that question is their religion, then really consider what that says about your own beliefs. 

Take your time thinking about these things, because they will determine a lot about your life. You have a lot of time to make the right decision for you. "

"Fiber supplement the night before. Then not eating anything the day of, coffee enema, shower, water enema, shower, another water enema, shower. In the last shower I use a wire brush for around the hole and a metal pipe cleaner for the inside. I also use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond bussy scrub, and on the cheeks an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint anal masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your hole out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging bussy balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. Then I pray to Satan for him to bless my bussy, and I kiss the Blarney stone. "

"This is, very likely, the end of your relationship. Your partner is a woman, and you're not attracted to women. That's usually a pretty fundamental incompatibility.

However, you can still be supportive of your partner's transition. I've known a couple of people who have been in this situation and who have maintained extremely close, loving friendships after their romantic relationships ended. It's not an all-or-nothing scenario: staying romantically involved with your partner and not being a part of one another's lives at all are not your only options. "
"It wasn't the case at first, probably because I just brushed it off as my ex being slightly ignorant, but: Belief in things like astrology (taking it too seriously) and distrust of science. Those are major red flags for me. "

A few years have gone by, but that hair, those eyes, and that devilish grin. It's unmistakeable. It's the driver from all those nights ago! "

"Yes. Especially when you're not in an accepting environment. 

Being gay robbed me of a proper childhood, and had left a deep dent in my self-confidence. 

I was taught at an early age that I am disgusting. I am a sinner. That my kin in Sodom and Gomorrah was smitten to dust. 

I was constantly told that I will get AIDS and die. 

Of course, to have this conflict between you and the world forces you to grow up and think beyond what is taught—think big. 

To solve this identity problem you have to read and read and read and think and  grow up. 

You realize at an early age at this world is far from perfect, and that in some places injustice is prevalent. You realize early on that life isn't fair.

When I grew up I realized that none of those were true. HIV can be prevented with condoms and PrEP. And I am not disgusting.

But there will be always that voice, like an old aching knee-pain that never goes away, telling me that I am less of a human because I'm gay.

It just never goes away, like most things from your childhood, from your formative years. 


There are days when I hate myself and I feel like a criminal. 

There are days when I feel that I don't deserve happiness because I'm inhumane—because I'm a freak of nature.

But you learn to cope. As you get older you will get stronger. "

"I took a job overseas not long after my partner and I met which meant we would have to have a long (as in other-side-of-the-world long) distance relationship for four years. We agreed to give it a go, but I think we both expected things to fizzle out.

When I moved, I found that the job was nothing like I expected and I couldn't settle in the country. I would talk to my partner via Skype every day and try to put on a brave face, but he could tell I was struggling.

Anyway, I was sat in my apartment one Saturday morning feeling really, really low when my partner called. He told me to go outside, so I did and I found him stood by my front door.

He had flown thousands of miles just to see me and try and cheer me up. Even more incredibly, he had a flight home booked for the following day as he had to get back to his job.

I was so bowled over that someone would go to all of that trouble and expense just for me. I ended up quitting my job and moving home about a month later and we're now in our seventh year of living together. "

"And I read on this sub multiple times from gay Trump voters that Donald Trump was a friend of the LGBT community, or so that urban myth went. I mean, he even held a rainbow flag at a rally upside down, and had gay speakers at some rallies.  Like so much of everything that Trump says, it's a lie or a scam."
"My husband will occasionally just loom over me. I'll be cooking or reading or cleaning and he'll just get close up behind me and hover. Occasionally he'll touch my hips or rest his chin on my shoulder, but he always succeeds in making me hyperaware of his body.

"You might be on to something here. The biggest source of anxiety from coming out is thinking it's ""one big thing"". 

But if this guy is just beginning to feel comfortable on his own accord, without needing validation, it would make sense for him to care less about who's watching him just be himself.

It's a beautiful thought, and I'm hoping it's true!"
You could say gays are stunted in some ways
"Some are. Especially those who come out young without supportive families.

But there's a well-accepted theory that many gay men go through a ""second puberty"" when they come out as adults. Since they suppressed their sexuality when they were young, they sort of make up for lost time, and also are behind on emotional maturity when it comes to relationships."
"I'd say don't make excuses. If you want to stay discrete at work, talk to the bf about it and let him know your reasoning. If he's good for you, he'll be okay with it."
I don't have any useful advice but I'd just like to congratulate you for getting out of the cult as a fellow gay exmormon. Good luck in the dating field!
That was probably just next level shade. 
Sounds like your friend needs some professional medical help.
"First off none of this is your fault.

For your own health go to the hospital and get checked out.
You need to get on PEP and checked for other possible STIs.

You need to have your body checked because it sounds like you could have serious damage.

It also seems you were drugged so you want to be checked for side effects of that.

Please know this was not your fault and not all men are him. This guy sounds like a skilled predator and this probably isn't the first time he's done this.

Please get medical treatment for your own well being!"

"Just an hour before you posted this, it looks like you were chatting away commenting on random Reddit threads.

If you're attention-seeking, as some of your other posts suggest may be what's happening, then I'd encourage you to seek help in case you become tempted to escalate that behavior. 

If what you say happened to you actually did, then you should heed the sound advice of many others here and seek help immediately as well.

Either way, you really should be speaking to professionals who are trained to help you. Best of luck."
I think 90% of our parents have tbh
aww :')
"Yeah I came out, taking advice of ""all parents love their children unconditionally, and will change their mind on the LGBT community if their child turns out to be gay"". My parents told me it was a choice, a mental sickness, and threatened to kick me out, until I told them it was a phase, and I'm actually straight.  

Call me crazy, but I feel like being in the closet is easier than living on the streets.

Do not recommend coming out to parents that are traditional.

Tell your parents when you're done school, and financially independent."
"He didn't even confess to what he did, he put the blame on that poor woman.

You, in fact, heard him entice her when she didn't want to hurt you by sleeping with him; your husband, however, didn't have an issue with that, obviously. 

I hope you're not gullible to buy into his crap. 

Furthermore, even if you take him back, you'll be riddled with insecurities and you won't be able to trust him from now on. 

Think it over and decide for yourself how you want your life to unfold from this point onwards. 

You have mentioned that you cannot make a decision on this by yourself. 
Then go ahead and seek counseling, by all means, even take your husband to sessions if you want to give it another try, but seek professional help in dealing with this. "
"sounds like life is going well OP

Might I ask how you met and how the kiss happened? Storytime pls"

"Your jaded view of the situation has no support. 

I get you're trying to be real, and tell it like it is. But it's just derogatory and obscene without any regard for the vulnerability of someone going through trauma. 

You are not helping anyone but yourself by saying the things you say. If anything you are negating the concern of others by claiming ownership of the ""truth"". 

Truth won't make OP any less sexually assaulted, so why don't you just hold your tongue and let others who genuinely want to help this poor kid out who has no one else to turn to except strangers on the internet. 

He knows what mistakes he made, all you're doing is rubbing it in his face like a bully. Do you feel good saying these things? Do feel like you're being responsible or ""keeping it real"" by telling him what he already knows, just to make sure he REALLY knows and can't forget. 

This kid, a freaking KID man, just starting his adulthood. And you have the gall to say what's equivalent of ""I told you so""....

You should be ashamed, and I hope your parents know/knew they aren't finished raising you to be a good person. "

"In case you didn't look at my username, I'm trans. 

I'd been going out with this guy and he never really asked me about trans stuff, which is the opposite of what tends to happen when I try to talk to guys. He always just treated me like any other person. But this one night we were out and be was telling me about this cool bar he'd visited with some friends, and he said that it made him think of me and he'd like to take me there. But then he said he couldn't, and explained that he noticed that the men's room was hardly private, in fact anyone who would need to sit down (as I sit to pee) would be clearly in view of the whole bar, and so it wouldn't be safe for me. 

Literally no one in my entire life before or after that has thought of something like that. And my interest in dive bars can put me in such unsafe situations if I don't have other options. 

That night I remember having tears in my eyes and going to the bathroom to text my friend how much I loved this guy. 

Unfortunately, after two years, he ghosted me about three months ago. "
"For me that would be a big nono. Not being able to let go of a social app even during such a important moment signals some kind of addiction - validation from new people, bad impulse control, lack of social skills. A pattern like that isn't something you want to wrestle with in a relationship."

Seems like a response to protect yourself because you're insecure and projecting 
"**PSA : Shaming others for not using condoms doesn't work - at all.**

In fact, it makes it even worse for gay men in the community. It discourages dialogue because guys who are interested in PrEP are too afraid to ask or talk about it because of attitudes like this. 

I once brought up the topic of PrEP in a group setting and this dumb ass gay kid just kept spewing vitriolic bullshit about how PrEP is just an excuse for men to be unethical, to bareback and indulge and have no self control. Afterwards, I have a few of them message me on Facebook actually inquiring about how PrEP really works - because they were too afraid to continue asking questions because of that asshole.

And bam - I just did my part to help 2 guys from contracting HIV. Sure - they might get STIs, but they were *already at risk and already barebacking* to being with. 

Even if someone has never barebacked in their lives, it takes only *ONE* instance of exposure. Sometimes you can still contract HIV even if you play it safe, because accidents happen (and also, stealth fucking is also a thing with deceptive assholes).

Men who are on PrEP are seeing *professional* doctors on a monthly/regular basis - so you can keep your ""PSA"" to yourself instead.

You're not doing a public service at all - in fact, you're part of the problem."

"It's because girls go. And because girls can't make out with us gays (unless they're drunk and basic), they try find a straight guy and will literally do it with any straight guy because the ratio of straight to gay is so low. Straight guys know this and also may play the ""oh I'm so accepting because I go to gay clubs"" card to the girls. Oh hunny, not on my gay ass. "
"from a mathematical perspective, you will always end up with a more preferable partner if *you* are the one who approaches potential partners.

"I seem to see a recurring theme of homophobic dads in this thread, haha. 

When I was 12 or 13 I remember my dad calling me into his office so we could have a little father-son bonding time in the form of ""making fun of some faggots"" aka he'd been reading some kind of hyper conservative ""look at these degenerate homos"" article about a gay pride parade and he called me in to crack jokes about the people on the floats (guys in short shorts and crop tops, etc.). 

When I was 15~17 I remember being in church when a lesbian couple tried to join. Everyone mistook them for a straight couple because one of them was pretty butch, but I could tell she was gay because she was wearing a rainbow pyramid studded belt. She freaked my parents' pastor out when she went to hug him and he realized she was a woman. My dad said if he'd been in the pastor's shoes he would've punched her in the face ""since she wants to be a man so bad.""

Then 2 or 3 years ago my family and I went out to celebrate after one of my cousins finished some kind of seminary and officially became an ordained minister. On the way back we stopped at a gas station, and my dad went inside to get some smokes and dip. When he came back to the car he was seething with rage. He turned to my mom and I, pointed out 3 guys who'd been in the store with him, and said ""you see those guys? ***FLAMING*** homosexuals!"" and was visibly upset for the remainder of our ride home.

Other than that? a few comments here and there from both of my parents about gay family members or even just family members who have ""too many gay friends."" They're pretty forgettable by comparison though."

That's kinda rapey. 
"Dishonesty. 

Something about it just hurts my soul. When you're with a guy long enough, you reach a point where you HAVE to fully trust each other and not hide stuff, at least nothing big. So when a guy lies or doesn't tell the full truth, he's not just being dishonest, he's basically saying he doesn't trust me. Maybe it's just my own insecurity, but my mind often makes the leap that when a guy is dishonest, he does not love me and is not worth keeping around.

Don't lie to each other, guys. Just don't do it."
"I had teachers (yes teachers) and classmates spreading rumors around the school (small university) that I was sleeping with these 3 women.  We were all together when someone told us. We all bust out in hysterics. We were great friends and study partners through most of school.

I also had a administration guy I worked with. He told me I should get a school sweatshirt and give it to a special lady  (because they like that sort of thing) and then people wouldn't get the ""wrong idea"" about me.  I was in shock.... I laughed but it also pissed me off. "
"But the ""am I the only one who..."" is kind of rhetorical. It's just a way to start a conversation about something they do that not many others do. Sure it's pretty generic and old, but it gets the job done. I don't mind it. "

"Wealthy people don't talk about it. I come from old money. Think rich Connecticut, private schools etc. I prefer to not discuss it. I live in a 2 bed 2 bath condo and drive a 2012 Ford truck.

"I don't think it matters, but even if you wanted to top, your dick is fine. It's average. You can hit a prostate with a finger, and unless you're some kinda mutant spider thing I'm guessing your fingers are less than 6 inches long too. Stop looking at porn dicks, you're fine. "

"I retired this week after 50 years as a lawyer.  Being gay and with my husband for the last 35 years has never been a negative issue and more of a positive issue in my firm and with my clients.
But let's face it.  We are different and we are not one of the guys.  I have never been asked out to lunch with other guys at the firm.  I play with men's balls but do not play golf and that is a big factor in separating me from the other men in the firm.
On the other side of the coin, when staff have a problem they usually seek me out for advice.  As a gay man I think we have more empathy for our fellow humans.  That has carried over to the 100s of clients that have made my life meaningful as a lawyer.
Be yourself with pride and no shame.  "

"Wow can't believe the comments here. Not everything has to become a gender or a fragile masculinity issue, jesus christ. So the guy doesn't like being called ""gurl"", you guys have never had people call you a name you didn't like? I am also not a fan because it feels and sounds gossipy and I'm not about that. I would just politely tell them that you're not a fan of being called ""gurl"""
No. You have to sleep with anyone you're not attracted to in order to prove you're not a racist.
"Absolutely this. The balance is key.

A guy that can adapt is extremely attractive to me. Sure, sometimes I'd want to lazy it up and sit around the house in sweats. I do enjoy looking appropriate for the public setting I'm in though as well, be it a casual restaurant or a formal event. 

I don't view hygienic things as high maintenance. I'll use a product in my hair to keep it styled and use a moisturizer because my skin can get fairly dry, but combined those things take like 5 minutes. However there *are* things guys do that make me scratch my head since generally they look fine without all the fluff. "
"You seem young and inexperienced. Never invest emotions in any guy too soon. You'll learn that men will do and say anything and seem so sincere while doing it yet most don't know what they want or they're just outright lying to you in order to have some fun aka sexy time. 

Don't get angry at him or hold it against him. Just move on. Don't get jaded or stir up needless drama. 

He's looking for dick, not a boyfriend. If you aren't looking just for fun and you're wanting a boyfriend, move on. 

Don't make the same mistakes I and so many others have made before. "

"You can choose to be true to your self and accept who you are or you can continue with you ""conservative lifestyle"" which will result in self loathing and anger. 

Believe me I grew up in a conservative home and when I came to terms with my sexuality every one around me shunned me and I started hating myself and other gay men or anything gay related, once you go down this path it's very difficult to turn back and the aftermath will only get worse the longer you remain in the closet.

Choose wisely and prepare for the consequences. "
He was incapable of expressing himself which eventually led to me always thinking of this quote by Robin Williams when I was around him; 'I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.'
How did that feel anyway? For the morbidly curious
"Next time just say Hi, who cares if there's too old men in there. A harmless, ""Hey how are you?"" isn't going to raise an eye. It's not like you're asking to suck his dick. Just say **Hi** and let it go from there. Be confident champ. You got this."

"Ugh. I hate this. If I'm just meeting you and you can't stay off your phone for a couple hours on a *first* date, it's not a good sign of what's to come. 

I've been lucky enough not to deal with this personally, though. Although sometimes I even have to bring it up with friends."
"That's an odd headline on the response piece. Toxic app culture was only part of the problem in the original story. The first round of damage was blamed on all that self-policing between figuring out something was up and coming out, and having nobody to talk to about it.

Anyway, this follow-up piece has some good points--mainly that it's important to look at every kind of gay man, not just a narrow band, and to explore and embrace the connections with other LGBT people--but the eagerness to dismiss psychology in favor of revolutionary politics strikes me as excessive. 

The key misunderstanding in this follow-up of the original piece, IMO, is *loneliness*. Loneliness in the original piece is a stand-in for depression and suicide rates. Here it's seen as its own thing, with its own political prescription. 

Anyway, nothing about this was comforting. Most of it seemed pointless and picky.

"Can confirm. Did not tell my husband my net worth until a while into our relationship. He'd known me for a while before that too. 

It can be stressful for a number of reasons."
"Oh yea all the time especially from my dad. he commented about Shep Smith (the openly gay Fox News host) along the lines of ""look at this fucking faggot, how the fuck can someone like dick up the ass fucking creeps hahahaha"" I'm sitting there like :/. Then another comment about another gay movie critic on local news being a gay and probably a child molester pedophile. Also really nasty comments on transgender people. I'm straight-acting so shits gonna hit the fan when I come out soon lol "
Your dad in for a good ride when you finally come out. 
Ridicule them for not being able to tell on sight.
"When they put down the things you like. ""Opera?  You mean fat people screaming on stage?"" Or ""Water polo?  Isn't that just volleyball in a pool?"""
Because this kid is obviously coming here for advice not so you can get off to his story. 
"The idea of there being a ""community.""

There's solidarity. Not necessarily a community."
"I had to been about 4 or 5 maybe. I knew I was gay as hell at this age.

We were having a family function at our house, and you know how kids are. They get bored and rambunctious and shit.

So I went into my parents bedroom. My mother had these beautiful red high heel pumps right. So I put those on. She also had this blue sequin shawl that I also snagged and put on, but because I was so little the shawl looked like a dress.

She also had this summer hat with roses on it. So I put that on.

I went into the living room to grab attention on this ensemble I had on. My mother found it cute and funny.

But my father then told me to go inside his bedroom. He closed the door and threatened me with a belt and said, ""Don't ever in your life pull that shit again.""

So that's just something that burns in my memory. "
"That's probably the worst response to ""I love you"" I have heard in a while. You should absolutely bring that up to him because you should find out if the feeling is mutual. He may just be awkward about it but Fuck man, he sounds disgusted you said it. That's very sad to hear. "
"You don't need to zoom in *that* close.  Generally, if you can't see both sides of at least one of the guys' bodies or an equivalent amount of space around the target area, you're too close."

"I love gay bars. I feel much more comfortable there. My local gay bar has changed my life 180 degrees. I met my boyfriend, my roommates and all my gay friends there. We go a few times a week as it's only a mile from my house. I really want to buy the place actually. 

One cool thing is that if I'm out traveling and find one I'm already accepted there. It's a nice feeling "
Uninstall Grindr.
"Translated what his boyfriend was saying while I was fucking his boyfriend. I met this couple online, and they were into one of them getting fucked by someone else while the other one watched. "
*tops of gaybros taking notes*
I think we have a new kind of sexual relationship here: translator-with-benefits.
"After I came out: my father who is to me nothing more than a sperm doner (mum's husband, my biological father, yet nothing to me) looked me in the eye in front of my whole family and said ""all gays should be lined up and shot"" and that was a few years after I had come out. So many things along those lines said before coming out as well. "
Probably because you see bottom as less masculine.
