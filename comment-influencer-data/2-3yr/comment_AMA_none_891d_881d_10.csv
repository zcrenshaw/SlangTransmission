"* Mince 6 cloves of Garlic and sweat (heat them up in a skillet)
* add 4 tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar
* add soy sauce to taste (DO NOT USE LOW SODIUM SAUCE **edit**: About 2 tsp)
* add 2 tablespoon Plum Sake (Drink additional 3 oz Plum Sake)
* boil off alcohol (Drink additional 1.5 oz Plum Sake)
* 3 1/2 tablespoons cock sauce (Sriracha)
* add 2 tablespoon brown sugar 2 tablespoon white sugar
* Red pepper flakes to taste
* Minced Ginger to taste
* Consume remaining Plum Sake

Simmer that shit for a solid 5 minutes, stirring pretty much constantly. The brown sugar helps it keep the proper consistency, so it's important to use it. don't use all white sugar, but you can use all brown. Play around with the recipe to your taste. Might want more or less balsamic vinegar. Might want more or more Plum Sake. I'd definitely recommend you make it several times to figure out your own flavor.

"Umm, yes, I'd like to know if you're dumb or just stupid? Thx."
"UPDATE:

I've been exposed. The smell was too bad. I just ended up confessing. We're currently pulled over at a rest stop and I'm thinking of just running into the woods, never to return again."

Stressed with exams man lol. I was at a uni library that's open for 24hrs  and I thought I closed all my incognito windows on the public computers they have avaliable. Civil engineering is my program if you're wondering.

"I love this question because there are so many facets to my answer.
1. It's a bad idea to criminalize sex work
2. It's a bad idea to criminalize johns.

I say this because I have been beaten and I have been robbed, I have been stalked and nearly raped. But because of the work I did, I could not access help from police. I had to wave a gun around like a crazy vigilante to be left in peace. Sex workers from my area had a very tight knit sisterhood and we looked out for each other and for trafficked women. If decriminalized we would be able to better help the women being trafficked without getting arrested or having our assets seized as collateral. Sex work laws only serve to penalize women for taking control of their financial situation and put trafficked women at risk."
"Sure! I used about 2 teaspoons soy, 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes, and a teaspoon of ginger. Then I added another quick squeeze of soy and sriracha"

"UPDATE 3:
**Also forgot to mention**

I panicked when it first happened and acted like a jackass by trying to spearhead the investigation to identify where the stench was coming from. I thought this would make me look less guilty at first, but it became increasingly obvious that it was not only a diarrheal event, but my drawers were the location. So now not only have I shit my pants, but I look like a bit of a lying sociopath. I'm afraid I may be confronted by her father later for this. "

Bravo team, once the family is out, move in and secure the package.

Edit: I meant ding-**dong** ditch but ding-song ditch might just prove to be a more effective distraction for the family. 

The confusion as to why a bunch of carolers just left a flaming sack of poo on their door step and are now running away in plain sight while also singing might keep the family distracted far longer allowing bravo team more time to rescue OP. "
"My aunt and uncle are white and their adopted kids are black. It took them a couple years to learn how to take care of their hair properly, as they didn't think black haircare was any different from white haircare. Did you have any similar experiences with your parents?"

I don't remember anything! There are no pictures of me with my biological parents. All I know is that my biological parents were not capable of taking care of me so they put me up for adoption.

"UPDATE 2:

I decided to stick this thing out. I confessed, we stopped at the nearest rest area and I dispatched my soiled drawers into the trash can. The stool itself was probably a ""5"" on the Bristol scale. I was honestly not really able to clean it all up and I still stink/ there is some on my pants. I did not give a full confession, just said I'm having ""personal"" issues and am have stomach problems. They likely put the pieces together as the smell of feces has been emanating from the back seat for the last 3 hours. Of course the family wanted to go eat before checking into hotel. Thanks for checking in on me everybody. I've been completely humiliated. "

Managing a ton of courses that are pretty heavy. I try to space them out so I don't have too many per term. U learn better that way and don't find yourself cramming them in because youre too busy with other courses that are intensive. A lot of ppl can pull it off but my preference is to have 5 courses or 4 courses per term. I try to take as many as I can in summer school.

"Maybe three times a week now. It's usually from old timers too. I used to work in retail, and would probably get 30-40 questions or comments a day. During that time, ""How's the weather up there"" or ""How's the air up there"" would be much more frequent."
"Oh boy well honestly? My biggest tip would be not to get in one in the first place.

Just don't care. Trust completely. I promise it's more realistic and fulfilling that way. Take care of you and help your SO because you want to, not because you're obligated to. Simple as that. Don't cheat on your partner either. That's bullshit. "

What's it like in the woods?
"Yes, I've read those theories as well and heard from them from my psychiatrist. In terms of physical trauma, I was born not breathing and had to have help with some kind of device for a little while after birth. I was physically and emotionally abused a little by my dad growing up, and while it's true that one of my hallucinations could be based off of him and his behaviors, I think suggesting the whole thing is based off of him is utterly ridiculous. I love my father and he has nothing to do with large portions of my illness.

Schizophrenia and other mental illnesses run in the family, so I'm inclined to think that genetics is another likely cause.

Thank you for your hard work with children. May I ask exactly what you do for a job?"

"You don't have your prom ticket yet? I'd go with a guy friend, or alone, and pay for ONE. 

As a woman, I will tell you what she is saying: She likes someone else, and doesn't want you touching her. 

You really should go stag, and leave yourself open to not be ferrying someone who isn't interested in you. You might even meet someone there who is dateless, and have a new experience.

She embarassed herself by being blunt with you, but you are too shy to deal the same bluntness back to her. Amirite?

"I was diagnosed at age 15 at which point they decided retroactively that I'd had it for years (for the record, I'd been in to see psychiatrists and therapists for years, but possible diagnoses wavered back and forth from autism to depression to DID etc. before schizophrenia became the catch-all for most of my weirdness).

My delusions began in early elementary school and increased in their intensity and general horror over the years. I was in such a state of advanced stress and pain around age 15 that I asked my parents to take me to a doctor or else I would kill myself right then and there. A few years previously, I had began to suspect I may have been mentally ill and so this was, to my mind, the last chance. Either this was an illness and I could get out of the situation via medical help, or if it wasn't illness, then the option would be suicide. Fortunately, I was able to receive some medical help and I'm doing a lot better today.

In general, the symptoms I were exhibiting including delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, stress related catatonia, depression, cognitive issues, anhedonia, and avolition."

I'm married, and my wife is right around 6ft tall. A few years ago I had a girlfriend who was just over 5ft tall. I wasn't picky about height, so if they were cool with it then so I was I.

When I was single, I heard a lot about women who have a fetish for tall men. I could never find any though. :)"
"In an operation room between surgeries, we had about 5 of us go into a room, we each had a section/job to do in the rooms, got it done as fast as we could making sure no blood, bodily fluids, etc. were left behind and in came the next surgery! The process between surgeries happened in 5-7 minutes. "

"In regards to experience, nadda. I had absolutely none, other than working for the hospital in the general housekeeping department. You didn't need to have any experience, though, they did give you a through two week training course on the ins and outs of the job. 

The biggest messes we had to clean up were in the emergency/cardiac rooms. It looked a bomb went off inside of a person in those rooms. The room cleaning that stuck with me the most though, was a a simple finger amputation. The reason it stuck with me was because earlier that day we had heard that we were going to have a trauma surgery coming in. During break, we saw on the TV that there was a 14 year-old girl that was in a shop accident at school and that she was being transferred to our hospital. We could watch the surgery though the OR windows, and of course we were all intrigued, but when it came to cleaning the room it was hard. There was a bucket where any blood/bone fragments were put by the surgeons and it was our responsibility to clean and take those out of the room. I was the one grabbing the bag from the bucket in that room and when I looked inside, there were 4 chewed up fingers of the 14 year-old girl inside. It was terribly sad, and that will stick with me as long as I live. "

"Definitely. Core strength is the biggest thing. As I mentioned earlier, I played basketball in university so I'm in relatively good shape now. More flexible and agile than non-active people my size (if there are any out there). But sometimes I throw my back out. It happens maybe twice a month. So my doctor and chiropractor have stressed the need to strengthen my abs and lower back to hopefully keep my spine in better alignment."

I'm constantly short of breath from basic activities.
"Sometimes someone would miss a bit of blood, which wasn't good. In that case, the surgeons would make us come in again and clean it up before they moved on with their surgery. It never happened to me, thank god. "
"No offence taken, I understand your curiosity. My parents did get backlash for adopting me, but over time people respected them for what they did. I don't feel like I'm being denied of my culture, I was raised in New Orleans, I was born in New York and my adopted parents lived there for a while until they moved back to New Orleans. 

My mom's co-workers are white/Asian and black so yes, they have friends who are not black. I have not heard what Paris said about identifying as black, I certainly don't identify as black.
