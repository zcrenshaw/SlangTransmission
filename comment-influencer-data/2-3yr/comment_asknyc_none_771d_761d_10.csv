"First I need to know if you are from California because if so, I could literally drug you, transport you unbeknownst to you to California, give you your favorite burrito, and if you thought you were in NYC you would not be happy with it.

"
People who are happier in their new locations probably are not reading this sub.
"Wow, just 25%?

I usually pay off my waiter's student loans."
"It's not stupid, but you'll probably need to exercise a lot of patience. And I would say deprioritize the subway as your main transit and learn the bus system. Nyc has an under celebrated (IMO) bus system. Download an app like [transit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transit-real-time-app-for-bus-subway-metro/id498151501?mt=8) where you can get real time notifications on when buses are coming. The bus takes longer in most cases, but it has [incredible coverage](http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/manbus.pdf) and uses the same metro card. You can then learn which subways have elevators and how stair heavy they are to make the most comfortable commute scenario for you.

"You walk on the right side as you would normally, the people coming up on the wrong side are the ones who should get out of the way."
"I'll add that 31 in NY is much younger than 31 elsewhere. I'm in my late 20s and I have friends in my hometown who are already on their third kid. My friends in NY are just now in steady relationships, LOL. "
"On a $10 bill, it's five bucks... for a poor waitress having to work in a crappy diner to support herself in a ruthless city. It's the absolute least I can do. We've all had crappy jobs in the city..."
"The lease probably doesn't specifically ban shitting in the hallway. That doesn't mean you'll get away with shitting in the hallway. 

It's 2017, you're fighting a losing battle on this one. The lease says no bad smells. Cigarette smoke is a bad smell. "
"More the reason to move here. 31 is extremely young, especially for NYC."
You can easily kill many hours at The Met
"If your heart tells you to try it and it sounds like something you want to do, just do it. So what if you're single and lonely for a while? Being in the Midwest doesn't guarantee a fulfilled family life. You could end up with a truly mediocre husband. I mean, that could happen in the midwest or in New York. Come here. If you hate it after a couple years, you can always move back but now you'll have two years of New York city living under your belt and you know you'll have tried. And maybe working in NY will make your resume stand out too, I mean idk. 

31 is not really old in my opinion.... does anyone seriously think 31 is too old to move to a new city? haha.

"Lawyers. It's all about lawyers. Get proper tax, litigation, real estate, and family lawyers. If you're going to work outside, have some liability lawyers as well. A bunch of thin lawyers will work better than a single thick lawyer.

Winter in NYC is a wonderful thing! You just need to be properly lawyered up."
Go to the turnstiles and give people swipes every 20 minutes.
"Oh, okay.

Stay in London, then."
"that was nice of you, consider it your good deed for the day"
"If you're a 'slave' to paying a car payment and car insurance, then you'll only be a slave to paying rent here in NY. "
subway juice! mmmm
"Layers. It's all about layers. Get proper boots, socks, gloves, slap on some long underwear if you're going to be outside for a while. A bunch of thinner layers will work better than a single thick layer.

Winter in NYC is a wonderful thing! You just need to be properly bundled up."
"You should move to one of the neighborhoods in New York where crime is at historic lows. For instance, all of them. "
"This is probably a more negative answer than you're looking for, but I moved from NYC to NoVA for a boy I was long distance dating for awhile (we met in college, but didn't date til later). It sucked not having a car, I was limited to getting a job within walking distance because the public transportation doesn't hold a candle to NYC. The bus could come early or late, but they're not nearly as frequent. I missed the city often. The city is so vivid and always alive. I'm not even usually a ""stay up til the bars close"" type of person, but the nightlife was just not on par. The relationship has recently ended, and now I don't really see a point to staying here with no car in an area where there's not much going on, so I'm going back to the city sometime in the next month. "
You can ghost hunt on my Tinder matches.
There's also a taco bell a block away so you can get your /u/burrito__supreme 
You have the high ground! Hold on to that railing and power on through.
"The landlord *did* provide an exterminator free of charge and you turned him away. Let the guy in on the first of the month, dude. "
"&gt;the gas oven was really hot while set to the OFF position

This isn't a ""slightly malfunctioning oven""... more like possible fire hazard, tbh."
You should focus on getting an education or a trade. Move to NYC after. Consider it delayed gratification.....
The best little unknown place is Sbarro's
"lol'd at ""I've put myself in charge because I trust myself the most"" "
"Fogo de Chao, Brazilian steakhouse in midtown. "
"Winters haven't been very harsh lately, with the exception of the polar vortex year. Last winter was barely even winter. Personally, I prefer winter to summer. It's fucking gross here in the heat.  "
"There's a service called Access-a-ride which they will take you in a car for the same price as the subway. You have to apply and be evaluated.

Also, while NYC is a walking city, buses are everywhere, and just about every type of store that sells something, also delivers.  A couple years ago I broke my foot and was placed in a traditional cast, and I didn't leave my apartment for 6 weeks. No problem -- I had Laundry picked up and delivered, grocery delivered, pharmacy delivered. Etc. "
"When you're dealing with gas and don't know if something is dangerous or not, call either Con Ed or the Fire department. People not notifying either when they suspect something isn't right is how we get gas explosions."
"You'll have a hard time dating because you talk about most girls ""missing the mark"" on looks, and go on to sound judgy. Then talk about being awkward and not well dressed.


Are you actually thinking of moving here to find a girl who will uproot her entire life and move to SF for you when you have no desire to actually live here? Is it going to be like ""Hi, want to go to coffee? Just so you know, I expect you to move to CA and leave your family, friends, and job of this date goes well""? Or dating someone for 3-4 years, and then being like ""Oh, by the way, I know we've talked about marriage and kids and stuff, so I figured I'd wait until we are already this entangled to tell you that's not happening unless you move 3000 miles away""."
Good bagels and good pizza are only found in NYC. You can get pizza anywhere but there is really something special in the water because no one can make an NYC bagel or NYC pizza like NYC.
"I did my undergrad in the city and I had the choice to either stay or move to Paris after school so.... duh. I loved NY but it was my dream to be over here, so the choice was pretty clear.

There are certain things that I do miss about New York. Paris is an extremely cosmopolitan world capital but France is still a really traditional country, so there's less variety in things like food menus, even if I sometimes felt New York tried SO HARD to be different for the sake of it. 

And like I said France can definitely be a little more traditional. The only thing I REALLY miss about New York is that New Yorkers are WEIRD and it's the best. In Paris there's a lot more pressure to blend in, so you get everyone dressing the same and none of those crazies that make NY so good.

But it is cool cause there's a huge cultural exchange between the two cities. There's a huge French diaspora in New York and it seems like Parisians love ~Brooklyn~ almost as much as Brooklyn loves ~Paris~. I know a lot of people on both sides of the ocean with connections, New Yorkers here, etc.

That being said I think NY gentrified a lot. I go back to visit every summer and every summer it seems more like a giant box store, the J.Crew version of Manhattan and the Madewell version of Brooklyn. There's less social support, the metro sucks, you don't feel like it's a city that supports each other anymore. There's no community. 

It's fine to be proud of making it in a tough city but that's such a bullshit transplant idea to have. Like even making fun of transplants. The point of a city is to take care of each other, to engage with your neighbors and community. 

In Paris you still have these impossibly old little bars and these same guys sitting around the table for the past 50 years. It's not trendy or glamorous or even cool but it's very Real Life in a way that New York isn't to me anymore. "
"Do not push through the middle. Go to the right hand side of the stairwell and just walk. People will get out of your way. If not, just stand still. Everybody knows you walk on the right. "
"Other burrito-related comments here are true, but this is the truest."
At least 69 times. 
It's hard to tell what they are when they are all dead.
"Nope.  Your mileage may vary - i think this guy's got you covered tho.

*plow mode activated* and make a brrrooooooommmmm noise while at it. 
"Well that wasn't helpful at all. They are both visiting and the wife's working, so he came to asknyc to get local opinions. Your response adds nothing to the discussion and just makes you look like an asshole who's trying to look smart on the internet. 

And to answer the question I think a museum is your best option. The met or the moma are both great options. Or, if you're near the high line and like modern American art, the Whitney is my personal favorite."
"A friend of mine worked retail full time and got a second job at the Apple Store on 5th Ave, which is 24 hours so shifts are available at all hours. Plus, they offer healthcare to part-timers and their health care is awesome."
You can stand by the exit to the Customs area at T8 no problem. There's only one door.
"Nice try, Kim Jong Un.    "

"A landlord can't get rid of stabilization while you are living there. Unless it rented for over $2800 BEFORE YOU, then it remains stabilized.

But being below a certain rent doesn't mean it's stabilized. Most apartments aren't. Does it say anything in your lease about being stabilized? Does it mention ""preferential rent""?"
I've used them many times over the years. Never had any kind of issue.
