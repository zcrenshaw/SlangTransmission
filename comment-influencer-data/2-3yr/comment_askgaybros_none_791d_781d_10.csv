"Sigmund Freud had some surprisingly modern views on homosexuality. He didn't believe that people could change their sexualities through therapy (both women and men). Also in a letter to a mother who asked him to treat her son's homosexuality, he wrote:

""Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them. (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime –and a cruelty, too"""

"After the public ceremony has been held the newlywed will be guided by The Queen (who is actually a 45 year-old drag queen, btw) to a chamber exactly 1/2 mile underground (they have these, sometimes several of them, in most larger cities). There the lovebirds kneel down and unleash the demons that live in the backs of all gay men (it is known). The demons fight each other to the death and only then is it decided who must change the last name. This also determines the sperm donor of all offspring of said couple as well as other more personal, bedroom specific happenings (For instance, under the full moon the winner is always allowed to top)."

"The number of times per day that you think about or discuss masculinity is a direct indication of how fragile your masculinity actually is.

Actual masculine guys don't think about it, they don't try to ""act masculine"" or read/talk about being masculine. They just are. That's part of what makes someone masculine in the first place, it's a specific kind of confidence that comes from never even entertaining the thought that you might be feminine, and thus not worrying about whether or not others perceive you as such."

"I'm not at all shy and not particularly anxious, but I'm super introverted. 

Needing personal space is just a part of who I am. I've clashed a bit with extroverts who took that as a personal insult or an indication of disinterest. If I don't respond immediately to all texts, it's OK. If I decide to go home rather than hang out longer or sleep at home rather than spending the night, it's OK. If I want to do something solo, it's OK. If we live together and I ask to spend some time alone, it's OK. None of those things mean I'm not interested, and I'm not sending mixed signals or anything like that, I just really need some time to be alone with my thoughts so that I can enjoy the time we do spend together.

"For the love of cock, teach him about STIs. 

When I was going through high school, all of our sex ed was based around how to not get pregnant. Condom use was taught, but only about how they could help you not have babies. What passing reference to the existence of STIs was actually had was only in the form of ""oh, just use condoms and you won't get them.""

Teach your kid about the big ones, and especially HIV. There's obviously no need to terrify him, but he needs to know how it can be caught. I had to learn about it from other gay guys AFTER I'd had some bareback slip ups, and I wouldn't wish that terrifying first visit to a clinic on anyone.

I'm not sure if high school sex ed has improved since the early 2000s, and while I can only hope it has, you still need to teach him about this stuff. 

Also: 

&gt; My 14 year old son recently (within a few months) told me he is pansexual, which I have a feeling is a pit stop on the way to just being gay. 

Might certainly be the case, but best not to put it that way to him haha"

I never laughed so hard at a thread title on here. Congrats.
I thought that was a satirical name
'closes Grindr'
That adding black and brown to the gay flag was unnecessary and it does nothing to help poc who are lgbt. Like as a black gay man seeing this new flag is not going to help me when i am getting called the word fag walking down the street. I also hate that when I express this opinion people call me an uncle tom or a coon for it
"I think you are lying to yourself thinking youre just straight, or not attracted to men. "
"- The mortality rate of gay men in concentration camps in Germany was about 65-70% while the mortality rate of jewish people was only about 30-35%.


- When gay people were liberated from the concentration camps they were sent to prison with new sentences not taking account of how long they spent in the concentration camps.

- Gay men were expiermented on to learn how to treat their ''illness''. These experiements gave no new knowledge, they were more like torture.

- Gay men had to wear a symbol of a pink upside down triangle. This symbol indicated that they were gay. Other prisoners in the camp made their life a misery.

Gay people were treated MUCH harsher yet we never learn about their life during the reign of Hitler."
"Please breathe. This situation is no longer in your hands. You are you and you're a fantastic person who deserves to be happy and you can't control how people react to things.

Don't worry yourself sick over something you can no longer take control of. I understand that you feel helpless and like you just crossed a bridge that you cannot uncross, and that's not entirely untrue, but be that as it may, what's done is done and now all that is left to do is take care of yourself. "
If he loved you that way he would have told you. But...keep losing weight and get hot AF for someone you haven't met yet. 
Snapchat filters on your Grindr profile.
"""Straight"", for example: ""Straight top looking for a straight bottom.""

What the hell does that even mean? If you are desiring to have gay sex, you are by definition not straight. If ""straight"" is meant to be ""masculine"", then say that. "
Hold your shit in for nine months.
That I don't feel connected or in the same category as the other letters that make up lgbt.

"The world is finally done with those puppy snapchat filters, right?"
"Please don't mock our customs, I risked a lot explaining this to you."
"Worse... I can't believe I'm admitting this, and I _will_ be deleting it, but my sister walked in on me when I fell asleep after jerking off, my hand was still on my dick and my finger was still up my butt. This was... four years ago? I only woke up and realized she saw me when I heard my door slam. We never talked about it, never discussed it, and I'm so glad to keep it that way."
I am so dead hahahahaha that made my night man
"The [Lavender Panthers](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908008,00.html) were a group of gay vigilantes in San Francisco that would drive around in a van and beat up violent teens that were attacking gay people. They were started by a priest who was fed up with police not doing anything about violence against gay men."
I'm not attracted to every guy I see you know.. 
I don't usually like twinks but Tom's an exception. I'd pound his cute little ass until his dick shoots out web. 
"Drag shows are stupid.

EDIT: Maybe stupid isn't the right word. More like unappealing. If I'm into men, why would I want to see men dress up as women?"

"- people have fetishes 
- on the APPs people can be weird and abrupt

"Straight people shouldn't be in gay bars, unless they're there with an LGBTQ+ friend."
I only find about 5% of guys attractive too. Still totally gay. Just a lot of ugly people in the world. 
Where else am I going to read these questions? 
"This is all good and fine until he meets a new woman and she becomes a major force in the life of him and his son. Then what will happen to you? Just be careful about how emotionally invested you become in all this, and don't move in with them. Continue to help out where you can and be a good friend, but live your own life. He needs you right now and is willing to take advantage of your kindness when it's beneficial for him and his child but he'll replace you with a woman at the first opportunity and you'll end up hurt. "
I don't know what I'm more annoyed by - the guy who thinks everyone is interested in his leather/doggy fetish or the people who made their kids go on a Pride march. 
The T and all of the made up letters that follow it should be dropped.
"Feels weird listening to myself, but here it is: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0qqYLkaPyVf"
"Maybe you're overthinking this.  I don't really care what two consenting adults do, even if it's in their living room, and I don't care about their gender preferences."
"Take him out for a drive, ice cream, some sun light. Lots of outdoor exposure always helps. Tell him the atypical lecture of plenty of fish in the sea, and you could also give him confidence by telling him a personal story of yours if it relates to his situation, i.e. how your first break up was and how you got over it. "
"Any variation of ""sane and sorted"", ""grounded"", ""down to earth"", ""nice guy"", ""no drama please""..."
I pee sitting. I've done it since I was a kid. My mom used to complain that I splashed too much pee to the walls so I just started to pee while sitting.
Lots of medical and scientific theories of the late 19th century have since been disproven. That's just the way science goes. It doesn't mean that those who developed those theories at the time were hacks. They were working with the best information and data they had.
"I only ever met one gay ""nice guy"" and he wasn't good in the head, like, he had... problems, you know?

I have however met a few ""nice girls"" who legitimately thought that gay dudes would date them if they were nice to them, because ""they weren't like other girls"". Well guess what ladies... you're still girls."
That's because the most visible gays are the flamboyant fem ones.
Be patient.  Be understanding.  Be yourself.  
"As an introvert I prefer to hear people talk and ask them questions instead of being the one talking.

"There's nothing wrong with parents bringing their kids to a Pride parade and teaching them acceptance.  And others  should be aware that ""kids might be in attendance"" and conduct themselves accordingly."
Put a chicken egg up there and see what happens?
"Gender identity is bullshit, all that matters is physical sex and you cannot change your sex. I think the transborg in general is pretty fucking fascist"
"A less common one but 

""Be interesting"" 

Like nah man, your standards are too high I can't do that. I'd rather have someone to cosy up with in front of netflix "
That hooking up with strangers is gross and dehumanizing. 
I think that mindset is also pretty annoying where I can't even have my hand in the vicinity of a guy's hair because he'll start bitching about me messing it up. And then have a strand or two moved out of place because of wind or something dumb and then him focusing more on fixing his hair than anything else.
"Yes, there are gay Nice Guys for sure. They whine ""all the gays are so shallow"" and ""DAE just want a committed relationship or is it just me?"" and get pissy if you don't message them back immediately on a dating app. It happens."
That people who are not versatile are seriously missing out. 
"""That'll do, pig"""
"Agreed.

I think the pride parade is a disgusting display of sexual deviancy and does absolutely nothing to further the cause of gay rights. 65 year old naked men with giant black dildo strapons and fairy wings is not ""pride"", it is degeneracy.

If the pride parade were an intellectual gathering where money would be raised or something would be done to raise awareness about gay teen homelessness or suicide or something, then it would be great, but it isn't. The pride parade is an excuse to flaunt indecent behavior in the name of ""pride"". Gay adult film festivals are more classy for fucks sake.

What are you proud of? That you like to suck dick? Get over yourself."
This is why PrEP is not a substitute for condoms.
"We had some pretty irreconcilable differences: I'm fitness crazy and he wasn't, I'm out and he wasn't, I'm real and he wasn't.

"Out of curiosity, why? Especially when your opinion is at odds with [The American Medical Association](http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf) and [American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx). I mean there is decades of research and treatment to support this."
"I think it's kind of like how, even though I've never fed my dog from the dinner table, she still occasionally hangs around when we're eating. 

Hope springs eternal.

There's one guy on Scruff who's been messaging me some variant of ""Hey"" ""Hi"" and ""Want to play"" every couple of weeks for literally years. "

"Please recognize that there is a difference between being introverted and being shy, nervous, quiet, and anxious.

I am an introvert. I recharge my emotional batteries by spending time alone. That said, I am pretty confident and outgoing when I am hanging out with new people. I am not wracked with anxiety. I just don't have the emotional energy to be around people all the time."
You sound like a narrator of a tutorial video.
"I have to disagree. From the very beginning of the queer movement, trans issues were interwoven with gay-related issues. We wouldn't have the right we have today without trans people and they wouldn't have theirs without us. We're both sexual minorities, as gender is profoundly connected to one's sex and so is sexual attraction. The LGBT+ community stands as an opposition to the hetero-cis majority as a reminder, that biological sex doesn't have to determine one's sexuality (as a whole)."
"He was essentially hooking up behind my back the entire time and never had the guts to tell me he was no longer interested in me until after I caught him. It honestly really destroyed me emotionally. But at the same time, I'm relieved it ended because he was terrible at communicating and never cared to support me emotionally."
"Sadly, I have to agree with u/_Norm_. Some guys are just born so attractive you'd be dumb to turn them down bc of their skin color. And some areas of the world are less racially tense. But most black guys aren't in these situations. They are just normal looking guys and live in normal places. What is it are you trying to get out of making this AMA? To flex on other black gays who have a hard time dating? To deny their realities? Are you trying to pull a kanye/lil wayne?"

* Anything resembling GOP politics (you can be a country boy who loves Jesus and guns, just know which political party butters your gay bread)

* An actual linked and public Instagram feed with pics of you on your travels and hugging your momma during the holidays
* Doggos that *aren't* compensating for your personality
* Genuine likes that aren't generic (Malbec Wine; sunset on the Mediterranean...etc)
* Some trivia about your background or interests
* A respectful little blurb about what you're looking for and your type
* A tastefully done profile pic that embodies your personality, age, fitness level, and general demeanor (seriously, spend some time on the pic and get your friends to audit it for you!)
* Honest sexual position emojis if you choose to use them (I don't wanna see a dozen Down Arrows and then be asked to bottom for you!)

"Your mother may believe that gay people are the most vile and disgusting group of people to walk this planet. She may believe that homosexuality is a choice made by people who are lost, seeking attention, damaged... She may think a lot of horribly ignorant things, that we all know are wrong, about ""them.""

Then her son told her he was gay, and ""them"" became ""him.""

Her entire understanding of homosexuality was shattered in a moment. She is asking questions, re-evaluating her understanding, and realizing that she didn't understand things as well as she thought she did.

Your Mom loves you. You've had your whole life to come to terms with being gay, yet your Mom has only had a few hours. Go easy on her. Forgive her for the comments she made in the past - she didn't know. She'll get there!

If your mother was going to hate you and disown you for being gay, she already would have.

My mom never made comments about gay people, but she did ask a LOT of questions after I came out. And then she asked me THAT question...

""How do gay men have sex?"" She asked.

I paused and said, ""Well... I've got my computer. I mean... maybe it's better if I just show you?""

She reluctantly agreed. 

So, I proceeded to search X-tube and pornhub for hardcore fisting videos, let her watch about 45 seconds of that, and waited.

She kept her composure. She immediately put on a veneer of acceptance and understanding. A thin veneer, with cracks. Through the cracks I could see the sheer panic and unbridled horror, which I let her sit with for a good 15-20 minutes before coming clean and telling her the truth and elaborating.

Have fun with this time. Enjoy your mothers curiosity and naïveté as her questions are her way of getting a better understanding of her son. If she didn't love you and planned to disown you, she wouldn't be asking them. She may not be doing it in the most appropriate way, but it's your job to teach her how to ask the questions, and where the boundaries are set. She reeling, and doesn't understand how she was unaware of something so profound about your life.

I don't know your situation, so when I say, ""she"" in reference to your mother - mostly I am speaking from my experience with my mother. Please update us, PM me, reach out if you need any help or advice. Most importantly...

RELAX!!! Things are going to get much easier very soon!

"I always thought of that as being homoromantic. I've had my fair share of straight male friends be this way with me. Honestly I don't see anything wrong with it. Also it used to be normal for straight men to kiss, hug, and hold hands. It wasn't until more Christian ways of thinking became the norm till it stopped. Also there is a thing that's called skinship that's essentially like this. I don't think your in denial you just know what you like. "
"Look I think people need to realise we are all more similar than we think - I don't think most people want *only* hook-ups, although a few do, its just that 'romance' ain't something which just falls into your lap, and a man got needs. By romance I don't mean ""omg we've been dating for a few weeks and he's super cute and funny"", I mean a proper genuine meeting of minds, something real.

Its like food - there are some weirdos who genuinely 'hate fast/junk food', but most of us will give into it more or less regularly. Generally we don't eat it because we think its the best food going. It's because its quick and easy and it softens the harshness of the world for a few minutes. You get some amazing fast food, but a lovingly crafted, gourmet, home-cooked meal is always going to top that.

But that shit takes *work*. And a lot of us don't have tonnes of experience with it - we need some training. And the last few times we burned ourselves within 5 minutes and gave up. 

That doesn't mean we don't want to learn to cook. But we don't want to starve in the meantime."

Then I caught him twice and he asked me if I could come back the first time. The second time I caught him he was masturbating while I was sleeping and I could hear the porn noises coming out of his headphones. I don't think that was the last time and I think it got to a point where we both did it if we thought the other was asleep. 

Idk if it was his European customs but the dude would not hide his boner when he got one. He would be rushing to get ready for school in the mornings and sometimes I'd see his wood.

I often feel bad that I didn't come out until during college. Then I remember that not so long before me there were men who simply never had the opportunity to come out.

If he pesters you in the way you describe he's actually not a very nice guy. He tells you you're hot *every* time he sees you? He's trying to get into your pants. At some point you will have to make it very clear this is not going to happen. He sounds like an asshole TBH. "

"&gt; Gay people were treated MUCH harsher yet we never learn about their life during the reign of Hitler.

Even after the closure of the concentration camps. Gay inmates were only acknowledged on memorials afters being Gay was more accepted in German society. It was not just Gay inmates, if you go to various camps like Dachau. The memorials have had stuff added as the various groups in the camps have been more accepted in society eg Roma Gypsies. "
That's just what a Chechnyan would say!

"Pride parades in their current state are detrimental to the community.

Open relationships are a detriment to the community.

Grindr and hook up culture are a detriment to humanity at large because hardly any one knows how to form a lasting relationship anymore.

Just because someone rejects you because of your skin tone does not make them a racist anymore then rejecting someone for their hair or eye color does."
"They didn't say that. They said gender identity is bullshit, and the citations the other user posted directly refer to gender identity being a thing. They also referenced the ""transborg"". They also referenced physical sex being the only thing that matters, which goes directly against the trans experience, and what the two organizations above think. You put words in OP's...comment?"

"A lot of Disney songs, especially the ones by the main characters, are about escapism or new life experiences.

Really? Seems you are the one with the most upvotes and those going against your view are being downvoted so no, you are the majority. 

&gt;What a disgrace

Taking more stabs at everybody who has a different view point than yours.

Somebody said they weren't ashamed of their bdsm kinks and your response was

""Damm right! If an old man wants to masturbate on a playground in front of kids, I say let em! They should be proud to be in such an expressive group! They need to just say ""We Exist, Deal with it[kids]!"" 

So according to you an old man masturbating in front of kids is your counter to somebody saying they shouldn't be ashamed of their kinks? Really? You have to be so extreme just to get your point across? You really believe people here are defending a pedophile masturbating in front of kids? In your words, that's says a lot about *you*

See the thing is that nobody has addressed and pointing out. Pride parades are different everywhere you go. That's why kids are sometimes in them. Because one pride parade might be perfectly family friendly and kids walk with them yet other pride parades have things like members from the kink community in them. Really what it comes down to is the parents. Do your research. The parents in this photo in my opinion are the one's at fault. They are trashy. Why would you let your kids walk behind somebody doing that? So it's up to the parents to do their research beforehand to find out is this a family friendly parade or this an adult one as others have argued with you about. Thats all it comes down too. While this photo is inappropriate, it's not explicit. Remember the straight world has plenty of faults too. Let's not all gather our pitchforks for the ""disgraceful"" gays who apparently want defend masturbating in front of children, well, those are your words not mine."

"Lying about being masculine on his online dating profile, and then turning out to be one of the most stereotypical gay boys I've ever met.

Don't lie, guys. Insecurity with your femininity and trying to pull this trick is far more unattractive than being fem. Just own it. "
That blonde brother on high school musical!!! Lmao 
"I get basically every guy I want as long as they're into a tall and muscular guy in a suit. Which on the surface is fantastic, but there are hidden issues that come with it. Sometimes it turns into guys liking me because I'm hot and not because they want to get to know me. Or they think that because I'm attractive they can't really relate to or connect with me. Or they'll start to get insecure when we are dating because waitresses flirt with me etc. The more attractive you are the more insecurity it can bring out in your partner.

I dated one twink who refused to take off his shirt after I did because he felt intimidated. Another cutie always felt like he wasn't good enough and that it was a matter of time before I left him. I have little patience for guys who always think they're not good enough. It's bullshit and turns into a self fulfilling prophecy.

 Eventually I found a cute boy who knew he was good enough for a man like me. Then I fucked the shit out of him.

Whole heartily second this. We walk in their foot steps
"Thanks for the response!

I've looked over the school sex-education curriculum briefly, mostly just looking for the holes (pun intended 😉), so I'd know what we need to cover at home. We are just outside of Seattle so it's better here than I think in some more conservative parts of the country but still not great. 

STIs are good to cover, thanks. We did get him vaccinated for HPV. Condom use has to be mandatory, it just does. For everyone. Oral sex also, yes?

About the pan thing, my post was long enough so I didn't elaborate but the way he worded it to me was ""pan-romantic with a strong preference to males"". I don't care either way, that's for him to figure out, I just want to make sure he has an emotionally safe space to do it in."

"The term ""cisgender"" annoys me.

I've gotten frustrated enough with the new (to me) gender ""variances"" that I find myself saying ""fuck it"" to everyone who is not either simply MTF or FTM. 
The idea of ""gender-fluid"", ""gender-queer"" or ""non-binary"" is silly to me. 
I am okay with someone feeling they are both genders or neither gender, but I am NOT okay with them expecting me to call them by non-gendered pronouns. 
I'm not calling one person a ""they"" because they feel they don't fit on either side of the gender binary. "

"I'm not saying he's malicious, people often subconsciously take advantage of others without even recognizing that they're doing it. He's hurt from the breakup of his marriage and craves the companionship and dual support for his son that he lost when his wife left. Enter you, the gay best friend who is emotionally supportive and willing to help with his kid, so naturally he wants you to move in. But like I said, the plot will turn as soon as he starts dating again. And I don't think your friend is totally oblivious to the ""relationship fantasy"" aspect of this arrangement, it may seem like he is, but I doubt it.  "

"Here's the thing about condom use for oral: literally no one does it, and even those of us who should know we probably should, don't. It's just not really a thing. That's not to say that oral risks are non-existent, but it's a lot less of a risk than anything anal related. It's probably a good idea to let him know that STIs are simply a factor of a healthy gay sex life. In his time he is likely to encounter a scare or two, because we all do. He needs to know the risks of the big bad HIV, but he should also know that while, yes, syphilis, for example, should not thought of as NOTHING, it's also extremely curable. It would help if he knows that. 

And good to know. I mean I get it, when I came out I did so as bi because I had intrnalised a bunch of stuff and it made it easier for me. Whatever works for him. Sounds like you're doing an amazing job of making sure he has a safe space to develop in :)"

"see not every pride parade is like that though. There are other parts of pride that do not contain elements of what you described. I have seen people talking about the importance of safe sex at pride,and people jsut coming together listening to good music. i wish that part would get as much attention as the dancing naked men on floats cause that is not the only thing that happens at pride"

"That there are only two genders.

Also, if the only interesting thing about a character on the telly is that he is gay, then he's not a very interesting character to begin with. If you want audiences to like a character who happen to be gay, have him do something exciting that isn't related to his sexuality. My unpopular opinion is that there is no point in having a gay character - or any type of character, for that matter - if the only reason he's there is to fulfil a diversity quota."

"I don't like being gay to be honest. It makes lots of stuff complicated - stuff it can take your whole life to figure out. It makes relationships complicated. I feel like it's been quite hard work, and I sometimes wonder what my life would have been like if I'd been able to put this energy somewhere else. Having said that, in trying to sort myself out I feel like I've grown a lot and learned a lot about myself and other people. If things had been easier I might not have learned so much. "

"Look up the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute of Sexual Sciences) and Magnus Hirschfeld. Berlin was at the forefront of the LGBT movement way before anyone else. When you see picture of the Nazi book burnings, some of those photes are from the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft. The institute has all of its contents dragged out an burned in the street. Luckily the founder of the institute Magnus Hirschfield was out of the country on a speaking tour when this happened. He actually was never able to return of Germany.

There's quite a lot of reading you can do about what happened to gays in the Third Reich. When the Nazis took power, they strengthened an old sodomy law that was on the books, but not enforced. They used this to round up gay people and send them off to the camps. Gay men had it the worst in the camps, being treated even more cruelly than the Jews. The saddest part about the whole thing is that these men were not recognized as victims of the Holocaust. Since homosexuality was illegal, some of them actually got liberated from the camps and put into prison afterwords.

"This happens for similar reasons that ghosting occurs on the dating scene. Really it can fall into one of a few camps.:

- They intended to make legitimate plans but are too anxious or insecure to realize them once they confront the fact that their identity/address will be involved in the process. Or they changed their mind at some point (see the top rated answer as to why this usually happens) and decided to cut contact at that stage rather than initiate further confusion/confrontation/offense by turning someone down.
- They had no intention of making legitimate plans and only arrange hookups for the thrill of just making dirty talk, to bait others, or some other dishonest reason, like to get pictures from them."
