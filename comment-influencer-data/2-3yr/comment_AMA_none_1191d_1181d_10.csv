"$287. Seriously the most bizzare thing I ever saw on delivery as well. I was taking a $12.XX order to an old man in a trailer park who was known to tip $5-$25 every time. I had delivered to him once already and got a $25 dollar tip so i was pretty excited. 

When he answered the door this time he was dressed completely in drag. Red dress, fishnet stockings, make up, black wig..the whole 9 yards. He sat down and immediately started reading from a small index card. I dont remember what he said verbatim but it amounted to this.

""Im a man of modest means. Over the years I have given several large tips. Sorry for being in drag by the way. Anyways im going to give this to you and i dont want you to say anything. Dont thank me, dont say anything, just take it and walk away.""

At this point im thinking 'whatever pal just dont kill me and wear my skin as a coat'. I walked away and got into my car. I looked down and realized he had given me 3 $100 dollar bills on a $13 order.  I got back to the store, paid another driver $40 to cover my wifes shift for her and we both left early and went out to dinner. Months later i saww him again. He was dressed normally and asked me what i had done with the huge tip he gave me. I told him i just paid some bills and took my wife out to dinner to which he replied "" oh man i was hoping you would go out and get a bunch of coke and have a good time"""
"Hey I just want to say I've followed you ever since you started this thread and you've been a real inspiration to me. Many times I forget to make that crucial final inspection of the bag and end up missing out on those last stragglers.

My question: when making a cookie selection what is your most important criteria? I'm a sucker for softness but my wife insists on prioritizing freshness. Thanks in advance!"
"Incest or not, you are still a lifeform. Every lifeform still produces love no matter what, it may be in another way or so. Look deep into yourself and find it. Don't beat yourself up, life is vast and forever. "

"Yeah, 100% you could get free donuts dumpster diving at a kk. They might be a little on the old side though, but still newer than anything you'd buy at a grocery store. There's probably a three hour window or so for perfect dumpster diving.

Basically find a store that is not 24 hours. Find out what time they close. On a weekday, the employees should be out of there no later than two hours after official closing time. Find out when the store opens. Generally, workers won't show up until 2 hours before official store opening time.

Again, weekdays are best, maybe tuesdays or wednesdays. The trashmen usually don't come on weekends, so monday will have too much shit to dig through, and might be full.

But basically, if shitheads aren't working the previous night, donuts are generally thrown away in their own bag, different from coffee, and milk stuff, usually.

Look in, find the bag that looks like donuts, and there you go. The non glazed stuff keeps a little better, as glaze sweats after so many hours and breaks down. But your chocolate iced cream filleds, custard filleds, cake donuts, and most of the specialty donuts should be ok."
"They used to, until they started abusing the shit out of it. When we first opened up, we encouraged cops on duty to come in, get a free donut and coffee, hang out, etc.

Within a month they started asking for just one more, and then a dozen for the guys who couldn't make it out, to two dozen for the guys at the precinct, and then when we tried to cut back they were like little kids, ""So and so got four free donuts last night"", so eventually we just stopped the practice."
"Yes, free donuts and drinks throughout their shift. Gets boring for most people the first few months, so you start making your own donuts, or if you're like me, you don't even touch the stuff. Off the clock, employees can purchase donuts at a 50% discount."
I think I speak for many when I ask: WHY?? Why would you do this to yourself?
"Was working an overnight shift at one of our more sketchy area locations. We see on camera that the gates to the dumpster are open. Someone probably stealing old donuts again, not that I even particularly care, but they always leave ripped open trash all over the floor, which is not good because it attracts pests.

Walk out there with one of my supervisors. The dumpster top is open ans there is literally a man inside the dumpster. Like standing inside on top of heaps of trash. The supervisor looks at the man, and says, ""Hey, get out of there before we call the cops."".

The man has something in his hand. At first I assume it's an old donut. It's not. It's old scrap. That's the extra dough that is leftover, and has never cooked, has a horrible smell after a couple of hours because of the yeast content. Basically rotten old dough.

He stares with crazy eyes at the supervisor, and yells, ""I'm the general manager now, fatboy!!!!"" and then proceeds to tke a huge bite from the scrap, and swallow. 

I just shook my head and started walking back inside, and the supervisor ran him off."
"I'm learning Portuguese with zero prior knowledge.

I can order pretty much any food now, ask for stuff to buy (clothes etc), get directions to places, that sort of stuff. Enough to get by anyway. I've been to places where they spoke no English and got what I wanted so that's good enough for my purposes."
"Biggest mistake I made early on was completely ruining about 2k worth of shortening. Was pretty sure I was fired, but the boss was pretty reasonable about the whole thing.

Basically, we clean out our fryer once a week, which involves dumping the shortenining into a resevoir tank, disconnecting the tank, and then spraying out the fryer tank. I forgot to disconnect the tank, and basically blasted a ton of water into boiling hot shortening, causing it to overflow and coat the entire restaraunt floor with greasy hot shortening, from behind the counter, to the lobby, to the back storage area.

I'm pretty laid back, and just kind of laugh off quarrelsome customers, but the last one that got me went like this.

Guy asks our processor (they are never with customers, they are in the back making donuts, unless we are extraordinarily busy) if he can use a coupon. She says sure. He gets up to the counter and the team member informs him it's an expired coupon, and she can't use it. She's right by the way, the coupon literally will say not valid when she tries to scan it, and there's no magic button that copies what the coupon takes off. She comes to get me, and as I walk over the man is extremely hyper and aggressive.

Now normally, I would have just said, sorry about that, we aren't supposed to accept it, she didn't know, let me comp ou a dozen or something and write it in the customer log book. But this guy immediately got on my nerves.

You know those types who say stuff like ""You gotta tell me if youre a cop, its the law"" and collects samurai swords, and wears fedoras? That's the kind of vibe he was getting off, and I was still prepared to comp him until I heard him speak.

""She already said I could use it, that's a verbal contract.""

Then he turns to the crowd and says, ""But they didn't know they were dealing with someone with a legal background. Now bag these, and let her know it's free.""

Dick. I tell him that the coupon won't physically scan, and sorry about that, I'll have a word with the processor and let her know to be more careful. He starts making a scene and screaming about how we are breaking the law, and that girl should be fired for telling him that. I smile and say, ok I'll fire her later, and then tell him the total.

Then he says that I'm breaking the law. I tell him to call a cop. Then he says he has a legal background again, I tell him to feel free to sue us, but he's not leaving with free donuts. He asks what will happen if he throws the boxes of donuts at me. I tell him he's banned from the store, and that we have his plate number on camera, and I'm calling the cops if he doesn't leave.

He leaves giving us the middle finger lol"

"i have no questions for you that i can think of, but i send you sincere condolences and wish you all the very best in the other areas of your life. keep your head up, live your life to the fullest, and do it in honor of your mom. it's brave of you to come on here and talk about it."
WAIT! was it a box or a bag?  Did you have some sort of black-magic-hybrid-container cookies?
...He'll give u four warning shots to the back.
"I'm going to get ""I'm the general manager now, fatboy!!!!"" on a t-shirt."
"“Boss!”

Laura doesn't bother to give me a summary of the problem. She just nods at the customer on the other side of the counter. The customer seems hyper. Late 20s, bigger girl, not one of the store's 
primary demographics of soccer moms or senior citizens. 

“Yes, ma'am.”

“Yeah, I'm allergic to chocolate.”

“We have a lot of donuts that don't have any chocolate on them ma'am.”

“I know. But I need you to guarantee that none of them even come into any sort of contact with any chocolate whatsoever. No chocolate particles, no chocolate powder floating over, no chocolate next to them.”

“I'm not sure how I can guarantee that, ma'am. I can look and make sure I don't see any chocolate on them.”

“I don't think you understand. If I ingest any chocolate, I will literally die.”

	
“Wait. You're telling me that you will actually die if you ingest even micro particles of chocolate? And with your life hanging in the balance, you'll go ahead and take a chance that the minimum wage fast food workers, half of whom couldn't pass a drug test at this moment, to accurately tell you if chocolate might have been next to the donuts you want? In a shop filled with chocolate?”

“You know what, you've got a real attitude. I'm calling your corporate office.”

She storms off. 

“Try not to step on a Hershey bar wrapper on your way through the parking lot.”

I could already see the overly serious email from the corporate offices, and the resolution of offering the woman a free dozen donuts. Chocolate free of course."

What a time to be alive
"Story checks out, he has never seen Aladdin. "
That's both touching and hilarious.
I can't think of a single question I could possibly ask of you 
"Another time i knocked on a door and heard a guy inside the house say ""im gonna fuck this guy up, watch. Free pizza tonight"" when he opened the door he saw how big I am and just said ""shit, youre big"" i just replied with 'yea dont even think about it' 
A female came forward and apologized for him. Not gonna lie it felt good lol"
When you give a cop a donut...
"Are you blue, furry and have a habit of saying omnomnom?"
I can't tell which question you are answering.
"Biggest challenges socially, if I'm talking to people I don't know in an environment or situation in not comfortable with I tend to have my metaphorical walls up and shut off from talking.

I find social interactions pretty awkward even when it's friends or family sometimes and a lot of the time don't really contribute much to conversations unless I feel I have something valuable to add.

Sometimes I have a tough time translating what I'm thinking / my understanding into words and come off as pretty clumsy to other people when I speak to them or they see me in public.

When I was younger especially I didn't enjoy big social events, I had a panic attack when I was younger at my cousins wedding and missed out on quite a few family events after that! I also now avoid a lot family holidays (though I'm warming towards it) because I hate change in routine.

I kind of feel like since I've began embracing my condition instead of trying to suppress it I've blossomed a lot more and not let self doubt hold me back as much

Being diagnosed and labeled with the condition (I was maybe like 8/9) I guess has given me a bit of solace knowing there are a lot of people worse off than me in certain areas, I kind of see it as a blessing  because I'm pretty happy with who I am and I feel the advantages weigh up to the disadvantages!

I hope these answered your question!"

"Hi! 
Ok so my strongest ""blends"" are:

- Colour + letters, words and numbers (A is red, B is inky blue and so on)

- Letters, words and numbers + personality (the letter B, for example, is reserved and timid but kindly)

- Music + shape/colour (when I hear music, it has an almost tangible shape in my head, as well as colour)

- Music + personality (A minor is a bit of a bitch)

- Place/time + personality/feel/shape (this one's hard to explain, but basically each place/time in my past and present has a distinct feel to it that I can evoke on command)"

"Well i ended up marrying the girl who hired me. Partly i stayed because i made a decent wage and partly because i got to work with my wife every day. Both of my parents were drug addicts so i didnt have the most supportive upbringing. I dropped out of high school my senior year to work full time and help my mom pay the bills. I was in several AP classes. It wasnt that i couldnt pass school i was just so jaded at that point in my life i figured i would never amount to anything and that a diploma wouldnt help me.

Obviously there are much better jobs out there but overall i managed to make about $18 an hour delivering pizza which is way more than i made in my short stint as an Emt or the manufacturing job i had.

Im now the general manager of three locations (same franchise) and hope to buy one of the stores one day if no better opportunities present themselves."

"No, it wasn't.

It was ""purchased"" on the pretense of being a debt-collection agency, but rather than trying to collect the debt, they just chose not to, and forgave it."
"My cousin was on property brothers. Every issue was scripted, or actually routine things that weren't a problem to fix. There was a running theme through the episode where he would request expensive additions and the property brothers would get frustrated about how they could never do it within the budget, but in reality, he's rich af and there was never any issue with the expenditures. 

The work was good though, they sold the place for a huge profit this summer. "
"We just use the stuff available to make new things.

Like there's a cinnamon apple filled donut. We might wait for a hot glazed shell to come out, and then use that filling to pump in the hot shell, making a sort of hot apple pie donut.

Or we might grab some whipped creeam, spray it on a couple of hot glazed, and then throw strawberry filling on top.

Or fill a donut with the white creme, and then fill the same donut with raspberry filling.

Stuff like that"
"It was a bag, I mispoke."
"Good job, John!"
"I've actually thought of this, and sometimes will try to sneak a sample to a customer, but the problem is the nutrition labels.

We need to be able to account for every calorie, ingredient, etc, and that's also why they are really strict on following formula cards for all donuts."

Precisely.
