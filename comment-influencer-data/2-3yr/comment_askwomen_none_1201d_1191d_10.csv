How assertive they'd be if they were in someone else's situation. 
"A lined, *lidded*, bathroom trashcan."
"Like others, I knew before the wedding even happened, but I felt locked into that fate. I couldn't disappoint so many people, including his family, even though I didn't love or even really like him much anymore. Part of it was also inertia; I felt that I'd set this thing in motion and could just get carried along with it to somewhere better than where I was emotionally -- that after marriage, I would magically *want* to care for this man even though he didn't really express much care for me.

It was stupid, and I wish I'd had the courage to say no to the whole business of it all long before I walked down the aisle. I knew it was wrong for me, but I thought I could make it right because it ""should"" have been right (I loved his family, we'd been together for so long, he worked for my dad, blah blah blah). 

We were married a grand total of 12 weeks, but we only lived together for 8 weeks. Should have listened to my dad when he said, on the way to the wedding, ""You know, you can change your mind right now and we can just make this a big party instead."" 

Dad, you were so right. We should've had the party. "

"The number of male redditors that claim their emotions are 100% based on logic and reason. It always comes up in discussions about how women are ""so emotional and unreasonable"". Reddit bros are like ""well how am I meant to understand because all of my reactions go through a strict fact checker and if something is irrational *i just don't feel it*""


Usually the same Reddit bros who go from 0 to furious when someone suggests there is a gender pay gap or that women very rarely lie about getting raped. "
"I am 35 and I just opened a coffee shop. Had my first paying customers today. Yay :)

Edit: I just woke up and saw all the reactions. Thank you, lovely people :) It is in Sri Lanka, so if anyone ever comes on a vacation shoot me a message and I'll give you details :)"
"Okay, so mostly the reason that I'm answering this question is to tell you that I love your username so so so much.

But on topic, I have this bratty younger cousin who is going to a froufrou private VERY religious college, and she's all pious and holier than and the worst parts of socially conservative all over her Facebook. Her favorite trick is ""mourning"" for all the trans people who are so selfish and arrogant that they think they have the right to change the body God gave them. 

Chica got a nose job for her high school graduation. And not a ""deviated septum"" fix either. She and her mother were in agreement that a religious college was the place to find a husband, and a cute(r) face was the way to achieve such lofty goals. 

I despise that wing of my family. "
"One of my connections periodically starts a kickstarter to go on vacation.  She promises in exchange for donations for her vacation she will give you a copy of her journal from the trip.

I have honestly no idea why she not only thinks this will work, but that the reason it hasn't worked yet is the specific details in the kickstarter.  She repeatedly does it, changing things like the location of the proposed trip or proposed content of the journal.

It never works, she's never gone anywhere."
"Mine personally: I loved the one where the guy asked if women can hear their boobs ""swishing"" around and mentioned how whenever he walks by women with big boobs he hears this weird mystical swishing.  Then someone mentioned something about giant dicks swishing and it was so funny."
"My friend has a ""boyfriend"" that she mentions on FB. Makes comments like, ""I love him!"" while posting a pic of the dinner they're eating. But for the last 3+ years has never posted a picture of him. Why??? Cause he's married! Her kids, numerous family and friends have met him. But she hasn't met his family and friends. 

So many people are happy for her cause she went through a tough divorce and has now moved on. If they only knew the WHOLE story....."
"I was having immense stabbing pains in my abdomen. I have an IUD so I was worried it was potentially migrating. I went to the ER because the pain was so bad I couldn't move or walk and was in tears. The doctor (who was not a psychologist or psychiatrist) looked at my chart, noticed I had some psych history, and went on this long rant about how depression makes us do bad things - really guilt tripping stuff - and then said that the depression was probably the source of my pain. He refused to even investigate more, despite me curled up, moaning in pain.

I managed to get another doctor in who gave me an ultrasound and discovered that my ovaries were riddled with cysts.

Fuck that first doctor."
"I think on reddit we (all) answer a lot of hypothetical questions with what we *like to think* we would do in that situation. It's not straight up lying, but my oh my is it optimistic.

Also, how much they earn. Not buying it. "
"The frequency of events that have shaped their prejudices and opinions. Like when they claim to know multiple people who have definitely been put on the sex offended list for simply peeing in public. I just don't buy it, I think they heard of it happening once to a friend of a friend who was probably just using it as his cover story after being arrested for something far creepier."
"His dad called me an ex's name. Followed up with ""sorry, we just meet so many of his girls..."""
They only contact you when they want something. 
"There was that one we got recently asking us what it felt like to hold an ""ice cold can of beer"" against our vaginas.

All the answers were like, ""...cold?"""

He disappeared for a few minutes longer than usual when he goes to the bathroom and the toilet had already flushed so I got up to see what he was getting in to. I walked around the corner to the bathroom and see him standing in his boxers inspecting one of my tampons. I watched him silently as he tried to figure out how it worked and his face when he pushed the applicator and it popped out was so hilarious I started laughing and he saw me. It was so hilarious. 
"My parents spent way too much of their hard-earned money on the wedding; and we had family, from both sides, that traveled across the country for the event.

I tossed down a couple of beers in the dressing room and thought (as I walked down the aisle) ""I wonder how many years I need to stay married in order make up for all of this."""
"I went to health services freshman year of college with stomach pains.

The nurse asked me if I was pregnant, or if there was a chance I could be pregnant, and I said no.  She said she wanted me to take a pregnancy test anyway, I said no.

I mentioned that around my period, I can get really bad stomach pains that are different than my normal cramping.  She said it was probably a pregnancy.  I said I knew 100% it wasn't.

So the doctor came in, and the nurse said before I even spoke to the doctor...it's probably a pregnancy.

Nurse left.  I told the doctor I was gay, and have never had sex with a man.  The nurse never even asked if I was sexually active.

Note:  I've been in hospitals more than most people my age, and this is literally the only time a nurse has been shit to me."
"* How they treat others. It doesn't matter how nice someone is to *me* -- if they're ever unnecessarily rude, harsh, or judgmental towards other people, then that's the real them and that's how I should believe they'll treat me once the novelty wears off or I inevitably do something they don't like.

* If I ever feel that I need to walk on eggshells around the person, change myself in any way, go out of my way to seek acceptance from them, etc.

* If they say or do things that regularly has me feeling embarrassed around others, having to make excuses for them, etc."
"That hot, rude, manipulative, conceited woman that they totally emotionally rekt that one time."
"I farted out loud twice when I first met my husband's younger brothers and I walked into a door.

The story:  We were in his family's living room watching tv with his four younger brothers. I had known them for maybe an hour. He pulled me onto his lap as I tried to walk by and squeezed me pretty hard. I didn't even have a chance. It trumpeted out!  Everyone stopped talking to stare at me. Hubinator cracked up and squeezed me again.  It happened again! They started laughing hysterically so I booked it towards the door, forgetting to open it in my upset state, and I ran into it head first and bounced off of it onto the floor. It was awful. "
US: being friendly to strangers. Makes getting through the day pleasant for everyone until someone who can't read social cues thinks you're flirting with them.
I work at a place with really heavy security so I spend a ton of time with cops. The ones I'm most comfortable with are the ones who are funny and friendly but remain kind of distant and professional at the same time. There's a good balance to be had. Corny jokes are always welcome. Sexism isn't. 
"Not me , but my sister had 2 ten pound babies within two years and at a post baby check up the doctor literally told  her that she was very loose down there and she needed to do kegels to keep her husband happy :/"
"We once had someone post an innocuous question about whether we'd cut all our hair off, and then people who responded positively received PMs with like, offers of money for videotaping it. It was *weird*."
"He was extremely jealous. He ""approved"" my guy friends and eventually didn't even trust me alone with other women because ""I could become gay."" He wouldn't allow me to watch certain shows (I did anyways). The final straw was when he told me if I broke up with him he would rape me and get me pregnant to make sure ""we were always in each other's lives."" "
"My honeymoon actually. I had zero doubts about marrying him, then while on vacation in Jamaica he was just an insufferable jerk. Nothing I did was good enough.  I remember going for a walk by myself (because he wanted to stay in the room and get high alone) and just staring at the water thinking ""I have made a terrible mistake"".  4 years later almost to the day, I moved out. "
That feminists and SJWs are the reason life sucks for them. If only we all stopped being so PC!
"When I was in mental hospital, one of the nurses sat me down and told me that maybe I wouldn't have such ""problems"" if I believed in God. I found that pretty fucking inappropriate, not to mention utterly ridiculous given many of the patients there were religious."
"It was my first serious boyfriend . We had been dating a few weeks but I had never met his family until the day I got drunk to the level of near alcohol poisoning. He tried to sneak me in his house but I collapsed on their couch throwing up and blacking out. His mom, grandma and little brother came down stairs to see what the commotion was only to find me puking on their couch and my boyfriend crying hysterically.  I woke up several hours later wearing his 8 year old brothers Pokemon pajamas... his mom had literally dressed me"
"Huh, if I see someone doesn't have coasters, that tells me i'm free to set my glass down anywhere."
"Met a girl in one of my drama classes in college. We became friends and she mentioned this guy she'd been seeing. I asked her about it.

Turns out it was my boyfriend.

She thought I was going to kick her ass, but like, why? It's not like she knew he had a girlfriend at all. She was as angry as I was. We went to his dorm room together and knocked on his door. His face when he opened it was fucking priceless."
"Bra strap guy. He used to post very frequently. The fetish was seeing bra straps slide down shoulders. First he was asking if we did it on purpose to tittilate and once he noticed they were getting pulled, he'd pretend to be a girl who couldn't find the right sized bra and liked it or a woman who noticed men checking out her bra straps and would drop them on purpose and do any of us other females to that. 

Then there was the guy who had a thing for women who could pick him up. He posted all kinds of things about strong women or muscular women and always gave himself away by following up with ""so can you pick up your boyfriend?"" Or ""do you ever try to pick men up"" 

I really don't care what kind of fetish a person has, but involving unknowing and unconsenting people in your own fetish is so goddamn wrong. "
Boobs and butt guy. He wa obviously 12. And asked if we were ok if our boyfriends touched our boobs or butt and if we knew our butts were touching him when cuddling and a bunch of other weird phrasings. 
Clean towels.
Or how aggressive/violent they'd be.
"He lied about his age. I was 18, he was 35 and said he was 27. He told me jokingly I was too old for him a lot when people asked about the age gap. He often would comment on girls being pretty and they were always too young...younger than me. 

He's now on the offender list. "
"I'm a lesbian and I find most of the sexual stuff created for straight men at best boring, and at worst horrifying. And in the middle, there's this uneasy disgust and annoyance at how women are portrayed. My first memory of that is when I was 9, playing Tomb Raider, thinking: why do her boobs need to be so huge, and why does she have to moan like that? Like I always dreamed about being an adventurer, but when I finally got a female character to play, she was *nothing* like what I wanted to be. 

The porn is what horrifies me, most straight porn in particular. I gave up watching when I was a teenager. Needless to say, lesbian porn for the male gaze is ridiculous and nothing like how I actually have sex. 

However I am a very new lesbian, so I don't know what constitutes the queer female gaze. I haven't seen any lesbian-made porn, or know of any lesbian Playboy equivalents. 

But... I also don't check women out on the street and stuff. I just can't find random boobs and butts attractive. I need to like the person first, and *then* everything about them is attractive. So that would probably be why random hot female bodies don't appeal to me! "
"I react anywhere from ""oh, cool,"" to ""huh, why?"" and then mentally put them in the ""nope"" list."
"I'm a guy, but I throw away:

* old toothbrushes

* empty toothpaste tubes

* empty hair product container

* empty medicine bottles

* new toothbrush packaging

* new toothpaste tube box

* used floss

* empty soap/shampoo

* q-tips

* beard trimmings

"
"How ""tolerant"" and ""open minded"" they are. It's all well and good to be open minded to theories but I find that many people, when the rubber hits the road, are much less accepting of those who think differently than them. "
"how much they can lift. I've noticed a ton of people who claim high numbers in a show off thread, but looking at their comment history, a week ago their max was 50lbs lighter? hmmm...

OH OH and whenever someone say ""I calmly, rationally explained to her..."" Or ""I calmly gave my well thought position in the heat of the moment..."" Surrrrreeee."
"No sex for a year. It wouldn't really change anything in my life, sadly.  "
"I'm 41 and childless... however, I'm in the process of a single parent adoption. I've always been somewhat single, but recently began dating a very handsome keeper who is fully supportive of my adoption. For all you ladies wanting and killing yourselves for something you don't have? Stop it. Comparison is a thief to joy. Don't fret comparing yourself against the grain. Life is better than that. :-) And if your life isn't going the way you want it, change it or try a different route. I completely changed my goals when I realized I would never be like everyone else and have the cookie cutter family at age 28. I redefined my life to flow it's own way. Now I'm glad I didn't marry and have kids like everyone else. I'm doing it my way and on my own terms. And now that I'm older, I'm more successful and settled and in a better frame of mind to rock an entire football team by myself :-)"
"We got married on the beach and then spent the day riding roller coasters. It was a blast, but I am pasty and ended up with pretty gnarly sunburn.

On our wedding night, I was violently ill with sun poisoning and all he did was complain about how he wasn't going to get laid because I was too busy puking and roasting in my own skin. Then he whined when I begged him to please go buy some aloe. Then he went to bed and slept soundly while I spent the night alone on the bathroom floor.

It just kept rolling downhill from there."
"Not me, but I have a friend in this situation. She really, really wants a baby, to the point that she gets very upset if you mention someone else's pregnancy or child to her, but she doesn't want to be a single mother.

She also, strangely, does not date. I've known her for nearly 10 years and she's only gone on a couple dates in that entire time. She acts like someone is just going to descend from the sky and ask her to raise a child with them. 

She makes enough money that if she wanted she could move to suburbs, buy a place big enough for a kid, and afford to pay for childcare and everything herself, and her family is very supportive and lives nearby... but she really wants to have her cake (living in a very expensive city and going out with friends 2-3 nights a week) and eat it too."
I can't believe there are people out there without a trash bin in their bathroom.
"I am going to be boring and say 'mature chedder cheese'. 

It's not the best type of cheese out there, but where I am from (UK) it is the most generic 'all-purpose' cheese you can get.

Plus I have found it to be the most adaptable type of cheese for various different 'cheese-related' recipes.

"
"I read parenting blogs. 
"
"This is exactly what I came here to say. A trash can in the bathroom, preferably with a liner. Also, extra TP jic."
"Towels that are a dark color. Doesn't have to be all. Just one or two. 

Dark towels hide accidental period stains and when I'm not that comfortable yet with a guy I'm seeing, it makes for an awkward moment when he has to see it when he puts his fancy white towels in the washer. Also hides eye makeup. "
"My sister has built this fantasy life online, largely by lies of omission, in which she paints herself as this impoverished person, the black sheep of the family, the unloved person whose family has never helped them, and that she's going to end up homeless, etc. 

Granted her financial situation is grim, but our family is fairly well off and helps her pretty regularly. They pay her car payment when she can't pay it, they take her grocery shopping, help pay her medical bills, send her gift cards, etc. She also lived in my parents' home until her mid 30's and paid ZERO bills or rent that entire time. My parents paid for all my nephew's clothes, lessons, bills, and even paid for his college (hers too actually). She'll also inherit a fair amount some day. 

She never tells anyone about this though. At one point I reconnected with a friend of hers for business reasons, and in talking to this friend she made a comment about my dad being so awful to my sister. I'm not going to play along with my sister's lies and I told her the truth she was SHOCKED. She, and apparently some of my sister's other ""old "" friends, had been totally convinced that my parents were just ""barely helping her"". 

It's absurd. She loves her dickensian story though. I think she enjoys it on some twisted level. "
if this person's still creepin and interested i'd def shave my hair on tape for ten thousand bucks
"There was an AM thread about if a guy could date a girl if they liked big dicks. A SURPRISING amount were like ""no she would cheat on me cuz I wouldn't satisfy her with my normal sized dong."" I made the argument that even if a girl likes bigger dicks, that doesn't mean that they're gonna go on dick patrol hopping on every monster dong they see. It's just a preference like a guy who prefers big boobs or butts but isn't going to dismiss girls who don't fit that.

TONS of replies were about how I'm a liar and that's not true because girls are cock gobbling goblins who just can NOT control themselves over penis.

Dude are super concerned with their schlong fetish or nkt"
good yarn ain't cheap.
"I walked into his bedroom to see him standing butt naked, watching a war documentary, eating a Philly cheesesteak with an enormous boner. "
"If they have a pet yes, if not I don't think so personally. "
"I do feel a bit uncomfortable around police officers but not for any good reason. I guess if a police officer interacts with me I just immediately assume I was doing something wrong.

So personally I'd just prefer them to keep their distance unless they had to interact with me."
"its like how everyone has ""an aunt who teaches second grade who totally taught a kid named La-a"" or how everyone ""has a friend who works in anesthesia who says gay men all have deep masculine voices naturally and fake their gay voices"""
"I'm not sure he ever actually *wanted* anything. He was the most passive person I've ever known. He definitely did not want the divorce, but I don't know that he really wanted to be married, either. 

He and I met when I was 16-17 and he was 22. That probably doomed things from the start as he didn't really change in all the years we were together, but I (and my perspective of him) did. I thought he was urbane and charming when I was a teen, but by age 20 or so, I'd already started to see how emotionally flat and without ambition he was. 

After we divorced, he sent me a pages-long letter about how he felt. It was the first time in ages he'd mentioned anything about feelings at all. It was already far, far too late. "
"I'm going to break from the bathroom theme here and suggest cozy blankets for your couch. Also, more than one pillow on your bed. And sheets... make sure you have sheets. A top sheet and a fitted sheet. Have at least two sets, so you can change them quickly if needed without doing laundry. You don't have to live in clean sheets, just when you have a lady guest. 

A spare toothbrush is nice, but don't go overboard. One guy had a ""guest bathrobe"" which I thought was totally creepy. How many ladies do you have over that you need hotel amenities for them? How many naked ladies have been in this bathrobe? Don't make my mind go there..  "
"I agree! My consequence when they say inappropriate or fucked up shit is that they need to say it to whoever picks them up that day. I won't say it for them, they need to say it. It's very effective and they usually never say weird shit to me again."
"Yes. If it catered to me, there would be a lot of women onscreen that most men don't find sexy. And all the stories would be about those women, instead of treating them like accessories. I recently listened to the Fun Home soundtrack, and the song ""Ring of Keys"" really got to me. I also remember the first time I saw a woman who was just living her normal life looking like the exact kind of gay that I wanted to be, and participate in. I was 12. If media were made for me, it would not have taken that long, and I would not have been shocked that a person was just allowed to be like that, and be happy. "
"Depends on how emotionally invested I was already. I would either continue the relationship as a non-committal and casual one, or end it there. Cohabitation is the end goal for me."
"I'm ashamed to admit that I knew I had made a mistake before. We decided to buy a house together. I wanted one that we could afford on our own in case it didn't work out. Since it was just in his name and he wanted something more impressive he ignored my suggestion and bought something he couldn't afford on his own. Why did dumbass me not see the red flag??? I knew the day of our housewarming that I had made a serious mistake. I still married him six months later and I am still having a problem with forgiving myself for this. I spent 8 years married to him. (I'm in the process of divorce now). During this time he crushed my self esteem and I have been working hard on getting it back. He's not a terrible person. He's smart and funny. He has Aspbergers. So even though he knows what that entails, he's a narcissist and he feels he is right on everything. 

It's complicated, but you know why every woman in this thread knew before they walked down the aisle? It's part of how we see taught to view relationships. We know that they require work and they are hard. You aren't always going to get your way....but if you compromise, communicate, and love him enough it's going to be fine! Even ending it people want to know how hard you tried or if you tried. How many years did my mom see me miserable and keep telling me I wasn't communicating enough? What happens in fairy tales....they fall in love and everything is magic. That's not real life though. Love isn't what makes relationships work it's what makes them worth the work. There's so much more that goes into making a relationship work and I can't believe how little people talk about the real day to day things that make a relationship work. Like companionship, the willingness to be flexible and compromise, the ability to work together as a team to achieve goals. 

Ahhh......sorry for the rant but honestly this is something I'm ashamed of and I've spent the last year repairing the damage to my self esteem and understanding of why I've done the things I've done. :/"
"A couple of days ago I mentioned that I was raped some years ago and that I was asked multiple times why I didn't fight back. Some guy showed up and started telling me that I should have fought back and that if I had I would have been ""fine"". He started quoting statistics about how women who fight back are less likely to be raped. I stopped responding to him because it was just really upsetting, but somebody else kept talking to him and the guy just didn't seem to have even the most basic understanding of human emotion, context, etc. He just kept quoting articles and statistics. 

It was really bizarre, like he was a robot or something, incapable of understanding anything but numbers."
"When I was a college freshman I went to the dermatologist. He decided to put me on birth control to help my hormonal acne. 


He asked me if I was sexually active, to which I replied ""No?"" in an unsure tone (it was actually true). 

He didn't seem to believe me. So he asked again ""Is that a hard or a soft no?""

Me: ""No. I'm not"", in a firm voice. 


Him: ""Well these are only for your acne. Now when you are *married* with your *husband* you can use these for other purposes""


The fuck. I was an adult with the right to do whatever I want with my body. Besides, what if I was lesbian? Or what it I was having *gasp* premarital sex?! Oh no...


It was none of his business. "
"People in Turkey live their emotions at extremes. This causes people to be incredibly generous and helpful, including to complete strangers and tourists. But this also causes overreacting a lot of times. Basically whatever you give, positive or negative, you get it x3 back and people can go from very angry to love you like a sibling in like 20 seconds."
"So you hate yourself for not being able to create arts and craft projects on a whim daily, feed your baby from your organic home garden, and provide schedule social activities three days a week around your workout schedule that kicked all the baby fat?? Yeah blogs are dangerous haha."
"A trash can in the bathroom, but your relationship status shouldn't dictate that."
Thats pretty much how I feel about small children as well
At this point I assume every question about dick size is some dude's penis humiliation fetish fap material. So many OPs argue women *must not* enjoy small penises in the creepiest way.
"I'm the older sister (by about 18 months) of a set of twins. I remember my mom being stressed when we were all very young, but I don't love her any less or carry any resentment from that time. And as an adult, I respect the hell out of my mom for dealing with as much as she did with us kids. Parenting is hard stuff, and I'm sure you are doing a great job!"
"Right after breaking up, he sent me a text message saying, ""At least I don't have a retarded brother."" My brother has Asperger's and he practically worshipped my ex."
"Not necessarily lying, but personally I have to tone down my opinions A LOT because if I'm not 100% objective about everything at all times, people lose their minds. I'll end up saying stuff I don't really mean just to keep people off my back."
"The most upvoted comments are almost always incredibly heavy-handed, unrealistic, and rude.

"Slash guy.  Example.

"He said to me ""rape is not evil"", and when I defended survivors of rape, he started defining ""evil"" to me in a way you'd read on /r/iamverysmart. I disclosed to him before that I was sexually assaulted twice and he described to me in great detail, smug and condescending, about why it isn't a big deal.

He would get explosively angry and it was often misguided toward the wrong people - I remember him being angry about a case of injustice and saying ""it makes me want to blow up a city.""

Him mentioning in passing once before heading to bed together that he would cut my long hair off. When I told him that was assault and people have had assault charges pressed against them for doing that, he kept arguing with me about what assault is.

Being too handsy in private and public, to the point where I felt like my body wasn't my own. Continually ignored requests to stop and my pushing his hands away."
"This is so crazy it's hard to believe. Not in a ""I literally don't believe you"" way but more so a ""how in the hell does someone get through that much medical school and still have the nerve to say some shit like that to someone, this is unbelievable"" way. "
"The person who wanted to know ""defloration"" experiences."

"1. Telling me how I feel is invalid or encouraging me not to share how I feel.

2. A pattern of taking anger out on others or getting angry when drunk.

3. Attempting to control me especially through shame or grief"
"I sold my house recently, and the realtor fees came out to be around $12,000. When we closed, the realtor gave me a cooler...a soft sided, baby-blue, broken zipper cooler that holds maybe a six pack.

It's the most expensive cooler I own. :-/"
"When I bought perfume from Ulta they gave me a set of free glass plates... Not that I mind plates but like... I went in there to buy perfume, I didn't really want them. I gave them to my mom."
"Some people enter them too readily, without proper communication and planning, maybe as a desperate attempt to save a relationship. These will not work.

Some people will refuse to be in anything else and hate on monogamous people or bang on about what's natural and what isn't. These people are not nice people.

Some people simply prefer a life of polygamy or polyandry, are open and honest about this, and will form many successful and long lasting relationships. These are the people who will succeed.

Personally I don't think it's for me. I think I would simply get too jelous and insecure, and I enjoy the exclusivity that being with one person brings. And that's okay too.

[Paraphrasing] ""Oh I just looveeee wearing heels, they're so comfortable and did you know that they prevent joint pain and they're good for your back?"" 

It was funny because it's so widely known that the extended wear of high heels can cause all kinds of medical problems, and nobody who wears heels frequently could honestly think otherwise. "

He'll coolly, calmly, rationally explain it is perfectly fine because she looked at another guy once and it made him insecure.

She lives in this magical world of denial that her ex-husband kept their sons from her when in reality she had done so much fucked up stuff to the family (she cheated, did drugs, kicked her own kids out forcing them to live models, etc) that her sons wanted nothing to do with her and chose not to see her for years."

"Definitely different. Media portrayals of attractive women, or women who are supposed to be attractive, are... disturbing. I can't see women as tits + ass + back +... or separate some qualities of a person from the rest of their body - and I think a lot of the questions we get here indicate many men (I don't think, and I don't want to believe, it's most or all men) do find isolated body parts sexy. 

There aren't enough masculine women. There aren't enough androgynous women. There aren't enough women who won't cater to men, who aren't subordinate to men, who are depicted *doing* things. I'm not attracted to women-as-objects, I'm attracted to people - and mind, I'm a *super* visual person, and I'm not saying I need to ~get to know~ someone to be attracted to them... but the visual needs to look like a person, not a flesh blow up doll."
"There's a guy who shows up occasionally with pretty intricate, usually really convoluted stuff about all the things that can go wrong when you have children, how BC isn't reliable, how women love to screw men over (of course!), blah blah. And his ""solution"" is always that clearly he needs to get castrated. I think he pops up less often here than in the over-30 sub, but I'm still puzzled every time he tries to argue that his ""concerns"" are totally reasonable and normal and castration is the clear and optimal solution. OK, you have a niche fetish; it happens. But why are you trying to *argue* about it?

Edit: I'm shocked and amazed 1) how many people know exactly whom I'm talking about, and 2) how many subs this has apparently happened in!"

"Walking down the aisle I knew I was making a mistake. But because I had chosen to continue that path, I was determined to make it work. We were together a year and 8 months before he finally spoke up and said he wanted a divorce. Now we are both happy and thriving in life. I've been with my SO for going on 4 years and just yesterday he (ex-husband) and his girlfriend welcomed their son into the world."
"I'm going to go off on a rant, so hang with me here. 

I have a co-worker/friend who is a 38 year old man who is single and has been his whole life. No kids. Wants kids, but no kids. 

Recently a old highschool sweetheart relationship has been rekindled and he's all giddy and excited because he thinks this is the one who will be the mother of his children. The catch is that she is married with three kids. Oh, and she is married to a SWAT police officer. This is her second marriage. 

She works as a nurse in a different city than her husband/kids live in and so she has naughty hotel rendezvous with my co-worker on weekends when she is out of town doing work stuff. 

So they've had this illicit affair going on now for almost two years and all along she's been telling him ""I'm going to leave my husband soon, just as soon as _________ happens."" It's always something like ""after the holidays"" or ""after the kids are out of school for the summer"" or something like that. Never happens though, but she keeps setting a new deadline and he keeps buying it. In the mean time they keep going with their affair. 

He comes to work and smiles and tells me stories about how they talk on the phone and she says things to him like ""I can't wait to have kids with you!"" He looks at me like I'm going to applaud him and say ""I think you're going to be a great dad some day!"" 

I don't. I say pretty much the exact opposite. ""You are pretty much a walking piece of shit for what you are doing. That woman is married with children and is walking out on her family and you are enabling that. You are delusional for thinking this is going to result in a happy healthy relationship for you. You are wrong for thinking that bringing a child into this world with this woman is a good idea. Her children are going to resent you if/when they find out the truth about your relationship with their mother. This needs to stop."" 

He rationalizes this by saying ""her husband is a bad husband. He is spiteful and mean and doesn't treat her well. I will always treat her like she deserves to be treated. Also, I want children so badly that I'm willing to go through with this relationship, reguardless of outcomes, if it provides me with a child. You are younger than me and don't understand my situation and how badly I want children. Maybe when you are older you will understand."" 

I've had about enough of it. Last Friday he brought up a casual conversation he had with this woman about how great things are going to be when they are together. I told him to stop mentioning it to me because it makes me angry at work and I can't concentrate because of it. It makes me angry not just because he's going about dating the wrong way, but because there is a husband and children involved and another potential child that could be brought into a fucked up situation. 

Alright, I'm done. "
"Smile and take off your sunglasses, if I can't see your eyes I have trouble reading you."
"I'm not a parent but my sister had her kids taken away and they now live with my parents and I. It's a fight every single day to do anything. They are abuse victims, both mental and physical, so they channel their anger and confusion in the most horrible ways. They are also mentally ill,just like their parents, so that makes things much worse. I'll fail them when I leave after finishing school. I fail them every day by not giving them hugs all the time or telling them I love them. They remind me too much of my sister by both looks and behavior so bad memories of my childhood arise often (like the times my sister tried to kill me). I can't love them. They tore my family apart,limb from limb,even though they didn't mean too. They hurt each other so much that my parents are waist deep in medical bills. I can't even get to the dentist to fix my 16 bad teeth because they have regular therapy,doctor visits, or other things they need. 
I will fail my mom when I refuse to take off of work to watch my brothers because I cant handle all of them.

I don't have the patience to deal with the worst one's antics or the oldest's overly stubborn nature when it comes to doing anything that resembles work. 

I'll never be able to be good in the kids eyes nor my parents once I'm gone. But I can tell you one thing for sure and it's that I'll never look back. "

"Obligatory I'm a guy - Well... We had the idea to drop acid for the first time together. We are in the park by her apartment and having a grand old time. We are both tripping balls and decide to go back to her apartment to watch movies and the such. Her parents were supposed to be out of town for another day.

I guess both parents were on separate business trips. Her dad came home a day early. She is in her room doing stuff and I am fuddling around trying to read movie titles (it was going poorly)

When she comes out of her room all sexied up and sees her dad she immediately dips back in her room to leave me tripping balls for the first time while I talk to her dad for the first time.

Straight vortexes into the nether appears behind her dad while I am talking to him about this and that and whatever. Walls are melting, stacks of DVD's doing a little dance and me...

She left me with him alone for like a couple of hours before I went into her room to see wtf she was doing. Had no idea so much time had passed.

5/7 would do it again! He is a great guy and we had a lot in common. I told him years later about our first meeting and he had no idea but laughed immensely at how awkward it must have been for me."

"I used to babysit a little boy when I was 19. He was about 8 years old. He was a sweet kid and very well-behaved (for an 8 year old).

Anyway, one evening his parents were running late, and my boyfriend arrived to pick me up before the kid's parents got home. His parents knew my boyfriend well (we were all friends) so he came in and sat down in the living room and started playing a video game with the kid. I was in the kitchen getting some fruit juice and I heard this sweet, polite, (in my mind, up that point) innocent child having the following conversation with my boyfriend:

Kid: Do you touch her boobs?

BF: Uh

Kid: I want to have a girlfriend so I can touch her boobs.

BF: (trying very hard not to laugh) You should have a girlfriend because you love her, not because you want to touch her boobs.

Kid: OK.

A few seconds of silence.

Kid: But, do you touch her boobs?

I just stood in the kitchen giggling. He was such a sweet boy, I never would have thought he was thinking about touching boobs or anything like that. So young. Damn."

When we were in a store, and he was touching my ass when no one was looking, he got upset at me for not wearing a thong, and told me i wasn't being sexy.

So she moves to New York a few years ago, daily updates on FB, and - never really did anything. Her posts are always what's coming up or going to happen - nothing ever seems to *actually happen.*

The problem I believe is she's now in competition with an entire continent of like-minded young women and she simply doesn't stand out. LA, NYC attracts them like moths to a flame

She did a Kickstarter last year for some 4-5K needed for clothes (gowns, swimsuits) and the entry fee for some beauty competition. She got one $200 donation, from her dad.

It's something we don't talk about in my immediate family because it's kinda sad.  Yet at least she's trying to chase her dream; the problem is she's getting no traction and getting literally nowhere with her life.

And like a fool I took off work, and took her to the clinic. But that's when I started thinking something was up.

Then she stopped sleeping with me all together, and kept making these new guy friends. They knew we were together, and made friends with me too.

Then one day she just exploded and said she didn't want to be with me, and that she had been cheating on me for months. And not only that, but she'd been cheating on those guys with other guys too. So while we were breaking up, I had to deal with those guys showing up at our house and screaming at her for cheating on them. "

But I can't say a thing because 1) I don't want to share such personal stuff 2) many people are pro-life 3) abortion is illegal 4) I'll just be seen as an unfit mother who hates her child, which would be the furthest thing from the truth despite how we started off... but obviously it's the first thing anybody thinks about when they hear about a ""failed abortion"".

He let me and my sister sleep in his bed while he crashed on the couch, but I almost turned him down. He had one bottom sheet, no top sheet, a dingy white comforter with no duvet cover,  and 2 pillows with no pillow cases. This was literally all he had in the entire apartment (no spares)...luckily I had brought my own bedding for the bed because I know my brother's a slob. So for Christmas I got him a really nice high quality light grey sheet set  (manly, won't show jizz stains, and can go longer between washings without looking dirty), a fucking duvet cover for his dirty comforter, and some goddamn pillowcases because hes a heathen apparently. 

After almost thirty years of being single, he started dating a girl, like, literally a week later and they've been together ever since. I like to pretend his high quality bedding had something to do with that. "
"I worked at KMart when I was in high school. We'd routinely run BOGO 50% jeans sales. However, these sales would only be on specific brands at any given time. We'd have racks of all different jeans on the floor, but the sign would say, ""BOGO 50% off - [given brand]."" 

A woman came to my register with a few pairs of jeans that did not ring up on sale. She argued with me about it and I explained to her that only a certain brand was on sale that week. She stormed away and grabbed the sign of the rack of jeans and brought it back to me yelling, ""But the brand name is crossed off on the sign! Doesn't that mean that everything on the rack is on sale?""

The brand name was not crossed off. It was highlighted in bright yellow to make it more obvious that the sale price only applied to that specific brand."
"My mom invited the priest, deacon and a nun in training to what I thought was going to be a quiet family dinner to meet the boyfriend. "
"I was standing in the bathroom with my pants and panties around my ankles. I did the classic ""uncork my vag"" plié and extracted my Diva Cup, which was full. 

Halfway between the exit coordinates and the toilet - a distance of no more than a foot - I managed to drop the Diva Cup. OMG I'm so amazing. Crisis aver....

Ah, fuck. I moved my hand super fast to catch the cup and didn't stop or didn't stop fast enough or something, because all that happened is the entire contents sprayed across the wall, shower door, toilet, floor and my jeans. 

It looked like Dexter lives here. "

"Not my personal experience, but when my dad was in the hospital for an accident, he had a trach in his throat preventing him from speaking and he was newly paraplegic. Some of the nurses came into the room, I guess assuming he didn't have his faculties, and made fun of the noises he made while breathing, mimicking him and laughing.

My dad didn't tell us that until years later. It still makes my blood boil.

On the flipside, another staff member of the hospital used to come in and watch movies with my dad during his lunch hour and chit-chat despite dad not being able to communicate much.

I have the highest respect and admiration for amazing healthcare workers, and absolute loathing for people who are terrible at that job. Heroes and utter scum all mixed together, I've come across plenty from both groups in the years I spent with my dad. "

"When I was 22, my Nurse Practitioner asked me about my sexual partner count. When I told her, ""None"", she wrinkled her nose and replied, ""*Really?*"" (like there was something wrong with me for not having sex). I thought most doctors would be thinking, ""Oh good! I guess that rules out STDs."" NOPE."
"I think we have the same friend! She's very outgoing and social, but works with married people, and hangs out with groups of married women. Not sure how you're going to meet a guy that way! Plus, she's Catholic and adamant about meeting a Catholic guy- you might think she could meet a guy at church, but no, she has a phobia of interacting with anyone at church so she hightails it out of there the second the service is over.

I cannot relate to people who complain about something but don't do anything about it."
"My ex said this to me, and it haunts me still. She was the only one who knew about my history of self harm. In a heated argument during our breakup, I shut myself in the bathroom to take a deep breath and compose myself. She shouted through the door, ""What're you gonna do, *cut yourself again*?"" 

We both went silent after that, as it dawned on her what she had said. "
"I have a diagnosis of PTSD. I wrote it on a chart when I went to get my Nexplanon implant replaced with a new one because I was also getting a pelvic exam and my PTSD is from abuse. The nurse who gave me the exam took one look at me and said ""you don't look like you served in the military"". I said no, never served. She then said ""well, why are you reporting PTSD? Why does it matter?"" I said that I like to warn doctors because pelvic exams are extremely difficult for everyone involved otherwise. Then, she said ""That's an insult to our servicemen. You don't get PTSD that way."" 

Demanded a new nurse. Never went back to that Planned Parenthood. "
"Oh, and clean dishes."
"I was using his computer to send out some resumes one day. At some point, he ran out to the store for something. I guess he automatically signed into AIM (back when that was a thing) when his computer came on because an IM suddenly popped up on the screen. I figured it was one of his friends, so I was just going to send them a quick response along the lines of, ""This is PandorasTrunk. [Boyfriend] ran out to the store, but he'll be back shortly"" and sign off.

It wasn't one of his friends. It was a 17-year-old girl he knew from work (my boyfriend was 27 at the time) detailing the phone sex they'd had the night before. I scrolled up to see their past conversations. At one point, he said he was thinking of her when he was having sex with me.

I didn't really confront him. I just left the chat box open and left before he came back. He called me later and tried to deny it all. Honestly, even if she were making it up, there were countless other reasons for me to get out of that relationship. This was just the straw that broke the camel's back."
"I work with special-ed kids. I had an 8 year old with autism stare at a kid who was having a temper tantrum, then turn to me and say ""what the fuck is he doing"". I was honestly just happy he used a complete sentence, since that's what we'd been working on.

I also had a 10-year old get upset, and instead of using his words, he reached out with both hands and grabbed both my boobs. Full-blown, squeezing boobie cupping. When I told his mom, she said he did that to her all the time at home, and that I should let him do it to me because it's the only thing that calms him down when he's upset. "
My favorite hobby is video games so the downsides would be society's general view of gamers/girl gamers and the fact that it encourages me to be incredibly slothful. Sometimes I remember to get up and do squats or something during cutscenes/running around times but generally I just get sunk into the couch. 
I'm sitting here wanting to cry and hug you. That is so very sad. I hope you finally found your happy place

"I never quite made it to the interview... but I made it to reception.

I was kept waiting for over two hours because they were interviewing a group of people and started running behind. I was getting more nervous as time passed, and when I get anxious I get an upset stomach so I was feeling sick. I was also on the first day of my period, which added to my overall sick feeling.

In the end, I was the only one left in the waiting room just off reception. My stomach was hurting a lot so I got up to get a drink of water and pace the room a bit. I was walking back to my chair when I realised I'd bled through my pants and onto the chair.

I felt like I was in my very own dolly zoom shot, and I went into major panic mode. The cushion could be pulled off the chair, so my plan was to hide it until I left the interview and take it with me but then I realised there wasn't anything I could do about my pants.

I told the receptionist I was done waiting, and walked out the door with my head held high and a stolen cushion tucked under my coat."

"It's definitely shitty to go out on dates and accept them buying things for you when you know full well you're only doing it for the meal. It's basically the equivalent of a guy pretending to be interested in a girl for the sole purpose of getting her in bed... it's disrespectful and dishonest.

Also going out on a date you're not particularly interested in every day for a month sounds like my own personal hell. So not worth the free meals."
"A women tried to kidnap me when I was 11. She grabbed me while I was washing my hands in a public bathroom and my aunt ripped her off my and started shouting at her. The women, who did not speak English, kept shouting back and grabbing at me. She ran away when other people came over to see what was going on. "
Similar thing happened to me. It was our wedding night. I came down with a stomach virus the day of our wedding (it wasn't just nerves!) and spent most of our wedding night on the floor of the bathroom in a very expensive hotel. He kept complaining about how we needed to consummate the marriage and how it would be such a waste not to in such a fancy hotel. I eventually stopped gagging long enough for him to climb on top of me and do his thing. I spent the night crying softly while he slept peacefully next to me. I knew that was the beginning of the end. 2 years later we were divorced. 
"Not being sure if I should get on birth control. Don't want to use condoms for the rest of my life, but also worried about pumping my body full of hormones."
"He didn't ask me; he bought a ring and handed me the box. As weird as it sounds, I didn't agree to marry him so much as I just accepted it like fate. 

As for his being without ambition, a 17-year-old girl with a boyfriend who doesn't give a shit about much except getting high doesn't necessarily see this as a negative trait. (I didn't even smoke weed, so I have no idea why I was A-OK with his doing it all the time.) It sounds stupid -- okay, it *is* stupid -- but at that age, someone who seemed ""above it all"" was attractive to me in a way he certainly wasn't when I was in my 20s and could recognize it as emotional indifference. 

I think he wanted to be married because the world expected marriage of him, and maybe because he wanted someone to take care of him. I also think he loved me in his way, as much as someone so completely passive could love. He was broken up when I left, which made me irrationally angry; where was this emotion when it might have made a difference? 

Just as glad he didn't, though. If he had, things might have limped along for a while longer, and I might have missed my chance to meet and fall in love with my husband. 

Edited to add: My ex occasionally compared himself to [Pierre, who didn't care](http://www.caroleking.com/discography/really-rosie/4/pierre). Apparently, he never got around to reading the end of the story -- probably because he didn't care enough to get there. "

"I have a friend that 'officially' met her husband on a train, and it was love at first sight.

"He was taking a particularly long shower one night and I think he's having some fun by himself. Naturally I go on in the bathroom thinking to join him. As I pull back the curtain I see him naked, on his knees... aggressively scrubbing the tiles and floor of the shower, sponge in one hand, cleaning spray in the other. He was too focused on the grime for any sort of sexy time."
"I haven't personally had this experience, but my best friend was just telling me last night that her doctor is apparently extremely judgmental and inappropriate. For example, she asked to get a full STD panel and pap smear, and the doctor told her that since she was 28, she only needed a pap smear every three years. She expressed concern cause she'd previously had HPV and wanted to make sure everything was A-OK down there, and the doctor started judging her about being promiscuous and unsafe because she'd had an STD. 

And then, because my friend was trying to be honest with her doctor and admitted to having done cocaine, the doctor refused to renew her prescription for antidepressants. Which, I understand might be some kind of liability issue, but seems very counterproductive to me."

She frequently posts pictures of her child and husband with captions like 'these two are my world' or 'not many people can say they are married, have a child and own a house by the time they are 23'. 

The truth is she messages me every other week telling me she is sick of her husband, and had been for a while and that he ignores her/doesn't listen. When I'm around the pair of them he looks equally bored of her and rolls his eyes whenever she speaks.

I listen to her and try to be the supportive friend, then next minute another post along the lines of 'date night with my husband, love him so much or ' flowers from the husband, I love him so much'.

It's obviously more important to appear to be in a healthy loving relationship on social media, than it is to actually be in one."

"I guessed it. He changed his style of clothing, went out more 'with colleagues', occasionally smelt of perfume and stopped wanting to have sex with me. I confronted him, and he denied it. I pressed the issue because I didn't believe him at all and then he confessed. We broke up. "
"I knew it was a red flag for me at the time, but I also thought I was over reacting. This guy went from calm to livid if I missed a call and didn't phone him back right away. To him, it meant I was sleeping around. To me, it meant I was a relatively well adjusted individual who didn't look at her phone every 2 minutes. "
"Because those options save a lot of money, particularly cohabitating. It's like having a coupon in your hand for an expensive thing you already have to buy and just throwing it away and then still buying the thing. Even if you're rich, it just doesn't fit my view of money. How is maintaining two separate leases just to avoid living with the person you intend to spend a lot of time with and commit to for a long period of time *not* gonna end up wasting a lot of money? It's not terribly hard to move out (or have them move out) if things really don't work out. Marriage I can understand being a bit more of a hassle to untangle, but cohabitation? It's not *that* big a deal."

"The other day a woman came in wanting to buy a dress for her daughter. She proceeded to tell me I'm too fat to sell her anything fashionable. 

I'm somewhere between a size 4 and 6. 

She also constantly berrated her daughter for being fat saying she would be so fat she'd have to wear a size medium (god forbid). 

The daughter bought a size extra small and we had to refer her to a tailor so she could have it fucking taken in. 

The worst part was that the mom was severely overweight."
"Toilet paper. I have a very good male friend who never has any toilet paper. Oftentimes you'd have to wipe your ass with paper towels or tissues. God forbid you had to take a shit.

"I dated my husband for nearly two years before I met his dad's side of the family. We both lived and met about three hours away from where his dad lived and being broke teenagers we just really didn't rush into introducing each other to family. Well circumstances change and he ended up moving back with his dad and step mom and we did long distance for a while. The first few times I went to visit him the family was out of town. Then it happened. 

I came up for a visit and got in to town and he told me just to come up to his room. I was eager to see him and thought the house was empty. We got into things when all of a sudden his door pops open and there's his step-mom. She just says ""um, no."", closes the door and yells at him to get dressed and come down stairs. He leaves me sitting in his room while he goes and gets reamed out by his parents and I contemplate trying to leave through the window, then his step mom comes back up and tells me it's ok she knows how boys are, ect, ect. And brings me down stairs. And that's how I met his dad and step-mom. Ugh. I still blush thinking about it. "

She flashed me to show how it's ""not a big deal"" so just do it.

I was young and drunk and terrified, and I wish I could say I didn't do it, but I did.

How do you feel about the new [Tomb Raider](https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1270&amp;bih=1250&amp;q=tomb+raider+2015&amp;oq=tomb+ra&amp;gs_l=img.3.1.0l10.777.1596.0.3161.7.6.0.1.1.0.64.340.6.6.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..0.7.342.IchM0IxaFOM)?"
"Well, one morning I got up before he did. He'd been feeling me up in bed a lot, but I had to get ready to do something and didn't have time for it to lead anywhere. I went to the bathroom, did my morning routine, and came back into the bedroom and he was entirely under the blanket. Pretty sure that I knew what he was doing, I went to hang out in the living room until I had to go to work and leave him to his own devices, kind of disappointed that I didn't get to help.

Later, I found out he was watching Naruto on his phone."
"Back when I was waiting tables I once got propositioned by a couple for a threesome. We had all been kind of flirting with each other throughout the night. I wasn't really surprised when I picked up the check and noticed that the girl wrote a note telling me that her and her boyfriend were interested and left her number. But, at the end of the note she told me that she was taking my pen because she liked it and wanted to keep it. We definitely didn't end up having that threesome.  "
"Thank you for asking! I am doing great now. I was getting ready to end things when he said that. I was alone with him and shut down the rest of the night. I broke up with him the next day. I made sure to never be alone with him again. I was afraid my dad would kill him too and I didn't want my dad to go to jail for me so I didn't tell anyone what was happening. It was scary dealing with it by myself. But I found some really great men after him, my SO especially :)"
Man what a victim of her own life. 
"Well I have enough problems being taken seriously as a woman in a ""man's"" line of work. Shaving my head would kill any respect I've earned with the majority of my co-workers. $10,000 is only a couple months of work for potential career assasination. If we were talking millions I might consider it."
"this happened to a guy I know (he posted a kickstarted to go to Paris). it was funded in less than a day. everyone I know thinks he already had the money, and made the kickstarted to show off.

edit: we think he funded it himself"

"Painkillers. My own mug (teachers can get territorial about mugs!). In the region of a million spare pens. Comfy shoes. Mints to avoid huffing coffee/tea breath on students. Small snacks to keep you going in case you don't get time to eat a proper meal. Some kind of bolt hole to go and do swearing in. I've been teaching over 10 years now and these things have generally seen me through. 
Edit - bring your best immune system. I have never ever been so ill as I was during my first year of teaching. Many parents have no other option than to send their kid in to school when they're clearly unwell and stuffy classrooms breed germs like mad. This is the first year I've had in teaching where I haven't had to take a day off sick. "
"I felt great pregnant! A little sleepy at the beginning, and huge at the end but other than that totally fine. I taught over 10 ballet classes a week until the day before I pushed my little girl out at almost 43 weeks....I did completely lose my mind between 41 and 42 weeks. I honestly thought I might be pregnant forever. But I wasn't, labor was quick and doable and now I have a little wild girl. My brightest light."
I'd like to know why but probably wouldn't go forward with the relationship. I'd like to live with my partner one day.
Server here. I will take all of your pens. I seem to lose them at an increasing rate around graduation season 
"My mom, when I was four, threw a plate of spaghetti on the floor because I was being a pain in the ass and she was in between anxiety/depression medications that weren't working. I remember crying hysterically and her locking herself in the bathroom to cry, too. 

But I also remember sitting out with her in the garden, pulling weeds and listening to Britney Spears on the radio, singing into the little shovels and throwing clods of dirt at each other when I was 12. I remember my mom calling me out of school when I was 10 and taking me apple picking on a Friday afternoon so we could make applesauce that weekend. I remember hikes up a local mountain when I was 7. I remember Chinese takeout on days when my dad was out late with friends when I was a teenager. I remember long drives in between lacrosse and karate practice. I remember conversations that happened just six months ago that still make me laugh. I remember sitting on her lap and crying over friends or boys pretty much from the time I liked boys until I left for college.

What I'm trying to say is that I remember a shit ton of awesome, amazing things that my mom has done both with me and for me. Sure, I remember some crappy stuff, but my experiences with my mom are ones that I would gladly do all over again. Your daughter's going to remember some crappy stuff, everyone does, but those things really won't matter in the long run. She's going to remember all the good things you've done with her and for her. "
"At my first retail job, we had to ID people if they were spending over a certain amount on a credit card. A seemingly normal, friendly woman was buying $200 worth of stuff and I kindly asked for her ID, like the register prompted us to. 

She got *extremely* angry and started screaming at me, threatened to punch me in the face, wildly waved her card and ID at me without actually letting me look at either of them while screaming, ""CAN YOU SEE THE NAME NOW? ARE YOU GOING TO MATCH THE NAME UP TO THE ID? ARE YOU?"" and then proceeded to grab two of the bags without paying and stomp out of the store. I was pretty much in shock and called security and told them the story. They watched it on the cameras and they couldn't believe how quickly she went from 0 to 100. We called the cops because we assumed she probably was refusing to let me look at her ID for a reason and she also had shoplifted.

Tip: The sketchier you act about showing ID or letting your cashier see your card, the more likely they are to be concerned and call security, who could very possibly send your picture to the other company-owned stores in the area with a warning about you being uncooperative and suspicious. Just show us your damn ID."
"I called the police last year because I was a victim of a home invasion. I barricaded myself in the room I was in at the time (no locks), grabbed a weapon and called the police immediately. Two officers showed up and one was incredibly kind and supportive, while still maintaining a level of professionalism and authority, which i respected and appreciated. The other treated me like crap. 

He acted like I had made the whole thing up. Nothing was stolen, and I was not hurt, and he couldn't find anyting around the perimeter. He seemed to decide on his own that I was exaggerating, or making it up entirely. He kept asking me questions about the break in, which of course is procedure, but phrased them in such a way that it seemed he was trying to trick me into admitting I was overreacting all along; ""But this lock was probably already scratched, right? Isn't it pretty old?"" ""This could have been like that for a long time, do you even remember the last time you used this?"" ""Why would someone come in this way? Are you sure you didn't hear your dog or the wind?"" ""And you think he came in this door...But you aren't sure."" (I was.)  Always with an attitude, really snarky, and I literally saw him roll his eyes when he thought I wasn't looking.

My advice to you is, when you're interacting with people, make sure your questions and statements are neutral. This kind of thing is very easy to do accidentally, but from a person in a position of authority, it's incredibly damaging. People will feel like they have no one to turn to for help- they will feel doubly attacked, and from a source they were expecting to protect them. Don't make victims feel like they never should have called you. "
"I'd say he's less of a piece of shit, and more desperate and pathetic. It's a little sad."
"He lied to me about something petty. A friend of mine, who had no idea he didn't want me to know, casually brought up the true events. He called her a nasty liar and that ended that friendship. She has never forgiven me for this. Well, later down the road, I had something of hers she needed back. Somehow the whole thing came up again. She refused to be called a liar (understandably so) and called up someone else who had been there but didn't know I was listening. His story matched hers. When I confronted him about it, he first denied it and called her more names but ultimately owned it and apologized. He played the pitty card becuase a distant relative had died and wondered why the hell I would bring something like that up at a time like this? So that conversation ended there. This was before we married.

He lied to me through out our entire relationship and told me several times that MY trust issues were what would kill our relationship. He cheated on me at least twice.  It has completely broken down my intuition. I have trouble trusting anyone I let myself get close to. 

TLDR: Lied to me, friend revealed the truth, he called friend a liar and let our friendship end over it. Later found out she was telling the truth (before wedding).

ALSO, I cried the entire night before my wedding until I fell asleep.  I told everyone I was allergic to my flowers. It's evident in all if my wedding pics."
Good gods. Yeah can confirm - am a cock gobbling goblin. 
"Well I read like 7 of the top comments. As a perpetually single male that wants to find Her and get married and have a family, you have all scared the shit out of me"
"As someone who naturally is this way (fairly unwavering rationalist) it's not something to brag about.

Not really feeling emotions isn't a positive experience. Emotional expression isn't easy. It takes practice, and when you're me there aren't many opportunities to do that. 

Want to come across as awkward and untrustworthy all the time? Want to have a hard time building and maintaining friendships because it's hard to show you care about someone? Want a lifetime supply of guilt because you don't get that upset when, say, your parents die? Well then, hop aboard!

The best part is you're actually horrible at the conflict resolution you brag about because empathy is difficult. You don't intuitively understand that people are people, not robots, and what they feel is usually valid even if it's somewhat illogical. Your solutions will suck because no one will feel good about them, and what good are they for if not that? 

If you do feel emotions but ""just don't account for them,"" guess what? Those emotions are having an influence on your ""fact checking."" That's basic psychology, and your lack of self-awareness there probably makes you much worse at this stuff than you think you are.

I honestly, genuinely believe this trait to be one of my worst, and have spent most of my life trying to curb it's downsides. So I'm very sceptical (or pitiful) of people who brag about it."

"Accusing you of ""victimizing yourself"" when you talk about women's issues."
"A friend of mine was in such circumstances. She did mention she was willing to give him one more chance as he showed her the will to make things right.
Tbh who are we to comment on that?! Leave her to make her own decision as no one knows better about the marriage/relationship then she does. "
"Ugh, whenever I get groped, I just freeze up, and I hate it. I want to turn around and shout ""WHY DID YOU JUST GRAB MY ASS, CREEPER WHO HAS THE FOLLOWING TATTOO AND EVERYONE SHOULD NOTE THAT TATTOO SO THEY KNOW YOU'RE A GROPING DOUCHEFUCK"" but instead I just freeze up every time. "
"He ""liked"" a picture on Facebook of him and another woman snuggling that she had posted, which happened to show up in my newsfeed. I took a screen shot and sent it to him while he was at work and just said ""I'm all set now"" and that was basically the end of it."

"I think most people have a carefully created social media profile, me included. I've recently Deactivated my FB, it was becoming unbearable. Everyone's lives seem so bright and shiny and full of love and flowers and holidays and well kept kids. So I guess it's all fibs more or less. "
"Any dog with the smushed snout, like pugs and bulldogs. And I'm just angry at their existence because humans are dumb and created a dog that can't breathe properly just because they wanted it to look that way.

"Shoved her hand under my skirt at a bar when I was 16 (she was at least 30) and when I pushed her away and got mad she acted like I had done something wrong and it's no big deal because she's a girl too and aren't we all a bit bi?

I almost slapped her. Just because you have the same private parts as me doesn't mean that sexual assault is somehow not bad."

"I worked at Disneyland, which isn't retail but is guest facing, so I'm going to answer anyway. I was a skipper on the Jungle Cruise, meaning I drove the boat around the little river and told bad jokes. 

There's a stereotype that women are worse at it than the men, but that's really not true. I've seen some terrible dude-skips and some terrible chick-skips, and some amazing dude-skips and some amazing chick-skips (if you ever are lucky enough to be in Lucie's bote, you are a blessed person). 

So this guy is getting loaded into my bote, and the guy looks at his three year old son and says, ""OH NO! WE GOT A GIRL! BOO HER! BOOOOOOOOO!"" and the little boy goes ""BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""

I swear to goodness, if I hadn't been warned that the managers were watching that day, I would have kicked the dad into the hippo pool and spent the rest of the cruise talking about why sexism can suck my dick. "
My ex did this. It took SOOO long to convince my family they were lies. Some family members still don't believe me. We split up nearly 5 years ago and I hate that he can still affect my life.

"I feel like a screw-up every single day because I'm too ill to take care of her. We were like any other mom and daughter pair before my illness got worse. I worked, I studied, she went to daycare, I'd pick her up and we'd go to grandma's, we'd play in the backyard, then we'd go home. She'd draw and color while I cooked. We'd watch TV while having dinner, then I'd bathe her, and we'd lay down to sleep. She would fall asleep in my arms and I'd carry her to her bed. Sometimes we'd stay over at grandma's because it was closer to work/uni/preschool. Rinse and repeat. Those were our days.

Last year my illness took a turn for the worse. I had to start skipping class and soon I was too exhausted to work. I started falling down because my legs would give in sometimes especially if I'd done too many things the day before. My daughter started staying at my mom's house more often. Then summer came and I was stuck in bed. I cried because my body hurt so damn much, I couldn't pick up my child, I couldn't exercise anymore, I couldn't shower in hot water, my boyfriend had to start bathing me on bad days. I couldn't cook anymore, I had to always be sitting or lying down. I fainted, I couldn't walk some days. I couldn't go out in the sun, no more playing in the garden for us. I couldn't run or play tag.

So after summer she stayed at my mom's, she's living there now. Grandma has guardianship of her now for the time being. I know it's not my fault I'm ill but I still feel like a failure of a parent and I feel ashamed when people learn my daughter is no longer by my side. I wish I could go back in time but there's nothing I could've done to prevent myself from getting sick anyway.

This got super long, sorry. Today's not a good day..."
"I got bought a really lovely, well-made, tasteful handmade piece of unique jewellery as a gift, and the person who made the jewellery shipped it with [This Thing](http://imgur.com/90109pZ).

It's one of those rub-on temporary tattoos, but for your eye.

I mean, I can kind of see the idea behind it, but since you need to use water for it, you won't be able to wear any foundation or eye-shadow under it (which would give the black-and-white pattern something interesting).  And it'd start peeling within a couple of hours given how temporary tattoos tend to handle being on skin that moves and wrinkles which... eyelids are VERY MUCH.

And you'd have to rub your eyelid really hard with it and soak your face in water which is going to leave you looking all red around the eyes.

It's just such a weird idea.  And I mean, I can't even get fake lashes on my eyelids they're so greasy and wrinkled, how am I going to use this?"
"The first time I stayed over at his apartment with my then-boyfriend, now husband, I woke up needing coffee. He went out to get some and returned having visited the nearby Target and bought a coffeemaker, some nice ground coffee and new mugs. He said clearly we'd need it every time I stayed over.  
  
Yes, that is why I married him. "
"""I really like how young you look. You're so tiny and even though I knew you were 19 when we met, I thought you were 14 for a split second. It REALLY turns me on that you don't look 20."" o.o My looks are a fucking curse. I dont care that I'll look 20 years younger when I'm 40 and forever be carded. Guys I'm interested in think I'm too young and guys that are interested in me like the jailbait look. If I'm into them too I have the thought that when I don't look so young anymore (even though still I won't look my age) that I'll get dumped for another younger girl with the same curse I have. "
"&gt; It's never too late...

"My ex who is still a close friend grew up in an abusive home, and I'm friends with his mother on facebook. She keeps posting all of these super-mom memes and pictures of her kids having fun which garner dozens of likes every time along with ""omg youre such a good mom"" type comments. She's estranged from my ex now, and constantly posts victim-statuses talking about how much she loves him and just wants him to come home when in reality she's made his life a living hell. It's actually rather horrifying as I've seen her first hand slam her 4 year old into a wall and have gone to pick up her 13 year old in the middle of a fucking hurricane because she locked him out of the house for texting her estranged son. "
"I love, LOVE, **LOVE** the phrase ""comparison is the thief of joy"".  So many people spend so much time comparing their life to others and feeling bad they aren't doing the same things or making the same money.  Had to explain to my niece who is really just starting her nursing career and living in an apartment she hates why she doesn't have the big house and high paying career like her parents.  People don't see all the work that goes into the end result so assume the end result was easy for the people they compare themselves to."
"I'm not the op but my take on it is moving to the next stage of the relationship. I don't need to get married but I'd like to know that my SO and I can be together for the long term and that means living together. 

I think it's just a greater step than having your own separate houses you can retreat to. "
"My eternal favorite is the guy who has a dualism/clone fetish...or whatever you call that? He has it. Bad. I always bring him up cause he was so annoying and so obvious and yet people fell for it all the time and answered his question. Idk why cause it's not even interesting. He's had like a million accounts and each time he asks about what would you do if you suddenly woke up and had an exact duplicate of yourself/If you could spend 24 hours with yourself, what would you do?/would you have sex with yourself/would you go on a date with yourself and what would you do. You can see it's the same person on every account because of how he writes. He's asked it here, on sex subreddits etc. My fave cause he was persistent and cause people didn't call him out at all and he gets actual threads that aren't clocked for fap fodder. He tries to be all innocent about it.

edit - Also the guy obsessed with medical exams on testicles. He'd ask about ""testicle checks"" all the time. He asked here, he asked MOTHERS on /r/mommit
It was specifically about checks he had done when he was a boy. I could never gauge what the fuck he wanted. But I guess some kind of humilliation thing? It all seemed very fetishy, but confusing fetishy. I wish I could post his account here so that you could read all this shit cause it's SO odd but that probably isn't allowed. I have it cause he messaged me just like he messaged everyone who ever posted in his weird thread. He was annoying on all his threads and he was annoying on messages. He would just whine about how he didn't know why anyone was annoyed. He asked some woman ""how often do you plan on having your son have his testicles checked, if at all?"" Like...ugh...what. Then he was asking mothers if they think the testicle check numbers should be increased to force him to get used to it even though he hates them. ...yeah. His whole account was that."
The fuck? She works in a psych facility with that attitude? Gross. 
I see this all the time but I read there fairly regularly and never see it play out that way. Most advice is pretty reasonable and usually dumping the person is only suggested when violence or a pattern of heavy handed manipulation is present in the narrative.

"As an English Major, those pseudo-intellectuals who talk as if they're enlightening you with severe insight and tend to over-use their hands when talking.

That has made some pretty damn attractive guys become 100% less attractive in my eyes. "

I made that decision to save my life and the life of my pets in the house. I am alive and my pets were not hurt. It was a moment by moment threat assessment. Can I overpower the person? What can I use as a weapon? Until someone has been in that situation, they are 100% clueless. I do not waste any energy on justifying my actions or behavior. Most of the time they are hiding their own agenda. This is something I rarely discuss. Especially on the Internet. (Yet here I am, lol)"

"Oh I do ""check people out"", men included, but not in a sexual way. Like if I see a woman jogging, I won't linger on her boobs and butt and watch them jiggle up and down. But I might see her butt for 2 seconds and think, ""Good butt, wish mine was like that"" or ""Those pants give good support, I should get some!"" 

But *staring* just feels so wrong and doesn't do anything for me. The staring I've gotten from guys is a big reason I plan my jogs for less busy times. "

"This girl I went to highschool with posts really artsy and high quality photos of girls that look very similar to her (usually with this face turned or not facing the camera) to pass them off as herself, so it looks like she has a cooler life and gets her photo taken. She's done this since high school and people have called her out on it but she claims she never says that they are her, as she leaves the caption blank. It's so bizarre. 

I just checked her Instagram right now ( I don't follow her anymore because of this) and she's posted two in the last month. One rock climbing in Hawaii and one on the top of a gorgeous flower covered mountain. Gurl you drive your parents car and go to community college "

"Okay, so this probably isn't considered a day to day interaction, but please take potential stalking cases seriously.

Last year my roommate at the time broke up with her boyfriend, and he began showing up at our door unannounced and demanding to talk to her. It escalated to the point that he broke into our house and her car to take her personal belongings (e.g. counseling journals).

The first officer we called about it basically brushed her off and said there was nothing she could do to help us. I've heard too many stories of women getting murdered in these situations, so we called again, explained what had happened with the first call, and thankfully the second officer was a lot more helpful. One phone call from a police officer was all it took for him to back off.

OP, I don't know if you've ever been in this kind of situation, but it is *terrifying.* I could barely sleep for weeks, we bought multiple forms of self-defense, and for the next month every time I came home I drove around the neighborhood looking for his car. And I wasn't even his target!

So please, please when you get a scared twenty-something calling about abusive ex-boyfriends, don't assume it's a private issue.

* If he cancels plans for a dumb-ass reason all the time, cancel that relationship - you don't deserve to be treated like that
* If he's over the top suspicious that you're cheating, he's probably doing something he's not supposed to be doing and is trying to cover it up by questioning you instead
* If he tells you he's still in love with his ""first love"" that's another sign to leave

Obviously I was a bit naive with some of these, but I had never really been in a ""serious"" relationship before. This guy spent a lot of time chasing after me before I said yes, so I thought he was legitimately interested in me (turns out he was just a piece of trash human) I learned a lot from that relationship, and I know I won't ever do that stuff again."
"I had recently started Beta-blockers for my heart for a few heart conditions. During the first week I had been feeling dizzy and tired because my heart was getting use to beating slower. 

One afternoon I felt strange. My hands were tingling and I checked my pulse and it beating slower. 

I went to the college nurse and asked if someone could take my blood pressure. I explained I had just been to put on beta blockers. The nurse took me into a room and kept telling me to calm down and then asked if I had any history of anxiety. 

I said yeah, hasn't everyone? 

And she kept telling me to just breathe and calm down and told me anxiety can make me think things are wrong when they aren't. 

I left and had my friend drive me to the ER. My dosage was too high and had caused my heart to slow down too slow. 

I've found that a majority of doctors, once they find any mental illness is in your history, they take your medical issues less seriously. "
"Oh god no, my tits would catch fire from the friction! It'd be the most pathetically funny police report ever 

""Witnesses reported hearing a hypnotic sound like two breasts wrapped in corduroy rubbing rhythmically against each other when suddenly the victims chest erupted into fire. The victim then began beating her chest like an angry gorilla in an attempt to extinguish the flames before she was able to remove what was left of her shirt and smoldering corduroy bra. The victim sustained 2nd and 3rd degree burns to her chest as well as severe bruising. One frat boy who witnessed the event stated it was the most glorious thing he had ever seen ""dude""."
"I would very content if the guy had a coffee maker/coffee available in the morning rather than having to put on pants to get some at a cafe.

True story: my now fiance and I were snowed in 3 years ago and I woke up like ""NEED COFFEE."" He had none :( I posted on facebook asking if any coffee shops were open and there was ONE. We walked 6 blocks in 3 feet of snow but dammit, I needed coffee! "

"I had a woman returning a dress that she purchased and then decided she didn't want. She told me I needed to give her gas money for her having to drive back out to the store to return a dress that had nothing wrong with it. 

I had a guy try and guess my cup size while he was buying a shirt for his girlfriend."

"Lost 85 lbs in about a year. I feel wildly different. I'm treated better, people are nicer, I get compliments a lot more unprovoked. Things look better on me- funky hairstyles and accessories are easier to pull off, clothes fit better and are made for my smaller body, and wearing more high fashion items is fun. I love myself more, I have more confidence, I enjoy looking in the mirror. I approach more men without having to hope they're into chubby girls. My skin is better and my nails are stronger. 

I've noticed a lot of people don't share this experience necessarily, but also that it's kind of weirdly socially unacceptable to say that it's improved my quality of life so dramatically. It either sounds like humble bragging or shitting on people who are content being overweight or struggling with weight loss."

"I don't have any real secrets, but I'm definitely very selective about who I share the fact that I'm a former survival sex worker with IRL. I'm less private with the fact that I'm a recovering heroin addict (two years sober), and that I've had more than one abortion. These are all things I'm supposed to be ashamed of, but I'm not, and I don't engage with people who would be shitty about those things, which is why I'm selective about who I share those things with."
"&gt; and I would not have been shocked that a person was just allowed to be like that

yes! this is an excellent description. I didn't know people were *allowed* to how I am today. Hell, sometimes I still worry that everyone can tell I'm wearing a men's shirt and are judging me for it and I'm committing some sort of terrible faux pas when I'm doing nothing wrong. Even as an adult, sometimes I don't feel like people are just allowed to be how I am. "

"[So much this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi6tshsXVUk)

I only use this account in relation to this incident: a guy masturbated then ejaculated on me on a crowded bus. Pretty much everyone says that if they were in my shoes they would have punched the guy. Sorry but I've literally never punched anyone, and anyway, the last thing you want to do when someone is being disgusting next to you is come into physical contact with them. You also have absolutely no idea about their mental state and how they're going to react.

Then there's the camp of people who say that they would have intervened, yet the bus was packed (it was 9 am on a Friday) and no one did, even when it was very clear what was going on."
"This is going to sound really silly, but I had an ex who would tickle me to the point that it hurt, and he wouldn't stop even when I told him to stop.  He insisted that I actually enjoyed it because I was laughing, which is a completely unconscious and uncontrollable reaction.  In retrospect, it really bothers me because he clearly didn't respect my bodily autonomy with regard to something as insignificant as tickling, so how would he have reacted if I'd asked him to stop during sex?  I'm glad I didn't stay with him long enough to find out."

Sounds a bit like my ex. Couldn't hang out with guys because I could cheat on him and couldn't hang out with girls because they could influence me into cheating on him.
"Canada: We're just so nice. Apparently. Til there's a hockey puck involved and then shit gets real.

The hockey thing -&gt; the country will lose its collective mind, especially during the Olympics. Everything stops for that gold medal game, and it's not even considered a possibility that Canada will not be playing in either the men's or women's gold medal game. 

I both love and hate that. It's a little embarrassing that EVERYTHING grinds a halt and we could basically be invaded during a gold medal game and no one would care, so long as the broadcast wasn't interrupted. But I also like that it's when we show our teeth a little. 

We're not *that* nice, you guys.

"Literally any of the advise I've received about my medical issues, from anyone who wasn't apart of my medical team. "
"It's a deal breaker for me.

I don't really see the point in being with someone long-term if we're not going to end up living together.

I want the sustained contact, intimacy and financial benefits of living together."
The hardest thing I ever had to do when I worked at Gap Kids was find an outfit for a little girl to be buried in.

Neither would be fun, but I could do a year without sex easy now."
"This is interesting. You and a couple other commenters here point out that checking out women doesn't appeal to you.

I'm a pretty straight female, and I definitely check out women (and men) all the time. I know it's kind of shitty, because it's definitely objectifying and something I don't like to feel about myself. I don't make weird comments, or leer, but for sure, I check out lots and lots of women. I'll make a mental note, ""nice ass"" or sometimes, ""damn she can rock that dress"" or sometimes, ""look at her make-up"", or sometimes, ""she's *beautiful*""."
"Never been in the situation as cheating is a total deal breaker for me. But I have been a friend and family member of those who have, and I totally respect their decision. Mostly it's a matter of ""they wont do it again.. lapse in judgement"" but I just hear ""I love them so much I'm willing to give them a second chance.. and hope to fuck it doesn't happen again""

I do think cheating is kind of like putting together a broken mirror. It will still function but you will see the cracks.. and it will take quite some time to look past them."
That is the healthy way to operate as a human being.
"Sounds spot on. Mine also got jealous when I mentioned my cousin. I was 16 and my cousin was 9. To be clear, my ex got jealous over my 9 yo cousin. "
Not everyone has misophonia.
"Honestly the only people who seem to really care about dick size are men. It's so unimportant, unless we're talking extremes like... I dunno, micropenis? And even then it's not like you need a dick to have good sex, some of the best sex I ever had was non-penetrative."
"I've never heard this, but immediately agree with it.  Travelling with someone, and having it be just the two of you, allows you to face a lot of situations that normal dating and even living together won't typically present, and it shows whether you get stronger because of it or realize that you'd rather spend a thousand dollars on an early flight home than spend another couple days abroad with this person."
"My god, I just realized I don't own a fire extinguisher."
"Last year I was in hospital for a kidney infection, and a nurse had put me on an IV drip for the first time. I have a huge phobia of needles, so after it had been put into my arm and I had sat with it alone for a few minutes, I started having an anxiety attack.

I was hyperventilating and started tearing up, alerted someone that I felt like I was about to faint, so they lay me down on a bed for a bit. After I had relaxed a little bit, a different male nurse came in and started adjusting the IV and gave me the solid advice to ""stop being a princess"". Sure solved all my anxiety issues, thanks man"
"It makes no sense if the other person didn't know you were together. If they did, I think it's perfectly okay to think they're the scum of the earth "
My brother molested me for a few years in our early teens and when I told my family; nothing was done.  Its hard because it had a huge impact on me as far as my mental health which in turn caused a lot of erratic behavior and several suicide attempts.  I also stopped maturing in a few ways emotionally.  It makes it hard to talk about my depression with people that have much of a connection to my family.

"Had an 8 yr old kid I was babysitting accuse me of touching him inappropriately. When my parents, his parents, and I all confronted him he informed them he was punishing me because I didn't make his sandwich the right way. He had seen a YouTube video that taught kids how to accuse their caretakers. 


His punishment was to go his room with his TV, video games, and all his toys and stay there for 30 mins before supper. They then said they'd be dropping him off the next morning. I laughed in her face. I told them I'd never babysit him again."
"I'm always skeptical when people post negative about their kids. Because I am sure they have their own side on that. Like what the parent did that causes them to not want to be around them, etc."

"I knew way before we got married. Before we got engaged, even. The first incident after we got married where I thought about what a horrible mistake I made was literally the weekend after.

It took me over four years to actually leave him for real but nobody really cared. My asshole grandmother made a lot of comments that bothered me, like to her friends she'd laugh and say ""I knew that wasn't gonna last"" like congrats on predicting the demise of my abusive marriage, grandma. But besides those comments, everyone was pretty supportive. Most of my friends/family didn't really like him much."
You win.

"I had an eye doctor who was making very inappropriate comments to me and got way too close to me. When he was filling out a paper I needed for the dmv, I started playing on my phone, and he said to me ""you know, I find that very rude. How would you feel if we were on a date and I did that?"""
"1) They're constantly 30+ minutes late to everything and are unapologetic over it. It's disrespectful as fuck.

2) They flake on plans last minute and it's painfully obvious that they're just making the excuse up.

3) Only contacting you when they need something, whether it's for you to validate their rants or to hang out always doing something they want to do."
"I'm not a parent, but I have 5 sisters, 4 brothers, and I've lost count of my niblings.  Let me tell you that is 100% normal and not bad at all.

oh gosh that word
"It wasn't so much something he did as just a feeling I had. The first time I had him over to my place I left him alone in my room while I took a shower. As I was turning on the water I suddenly felt like I shouldn't leave this guy alone in my room because he might steal from me. I quickly dismissed this as me being my typical worrywart self. I scolded myself, told myself I needed to be more trusting, and carried on.

Six months later I found myself sitting in my car outside his grandmother's house while he dashed inside to steal a giant coin jar that she'd been saving for years.

He stole from everyone. His mother, his sisters, his friends, his employers. But he never stole anything material from me. He took sex from me whenever he wanted, though."
We go back to a random person's house we both have never met that way it's neutral territory.
"I'm going to be tossing period-blood-soaked stuff in there, so, yes."

Because they also threw away so much right for one mistake? Just my differing perspective. 
That's not Eastern Europe at all. You're thinking Southern Europe.
"My sister has PCOS and had an abnormal pap result and was scheduled for a colposcopy. The doctor she had that appointment with rambled on about how he thought all women should get paps every 6 months because girls don't wait anymore and stds are out of control. She then let him know about how she's had horrible cramping ever since they did her pap and he said ""let's not blame the doctor. We will blame it on a poor diet."" 

He actually is in the same office as my obgyn and I tried to get her to report him but she wouldn't."
