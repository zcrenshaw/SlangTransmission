"So if I understand this correctly, someone who is NOT the children's legal guardians have currently abducted your children and are keeping them from you?

/r/Legaladvice would be more helpful, but I would be asking your lawyer what the cops would say to this situation.

Also, who exactly is telling you that you need a trial attorney?"
She won't let me
"Girl: ugh I have to work early tomorrow

Me: oh really where do you work?

Girl: ... here

She was my co-worker and we were at work . True story."
And they burglarized OPs house as well.
Mail him back the same slice with pineapple on it
"Drive to their house, knock in the door and ask to take your kids and belongings home. When they say no, call 911, tell them your in-laws are refusing to return your children and belongings.

Sit and wait for the police. They will help remedy the situation, as well as point you in the right direction for legal support. 

Edit: I accidentally said ""knock in"" and not ""on"" their door. Granted if my in-laws were withholding access to my children I would want to kick the door in, I don't think it would help your cause.

edit to the edit:

A restraining order may be useful as well. You don't want them showing up at school and trying to pick the kids up or something.

"After breaking up with my girlfriend during the 2nd year of university, I was constantly trying to forget about her and move on with my life. I come back to my apartment to begin my 4th year and see she's moving into the apartment next door to mine. Our rooms shared a wall. For 9 months, I had to wear earplugs when her boyfriend came over... "
She asks questions back to you when you're talking to them. I've found that girls who don't do that are usually selfish people. 
"Big tits...I have nothing against them, but they are not really better than any other size.

Cars.  I like them, I just don't know a lot about them and don't care to.  I just know I like a comfortable ride."
"Legally I'm fairly certain they can't take your kids away unless they can prove you're unfit to raise them.  If your late wife's parents take your kids, call the cops and report them for kidnapping."
"Oh boy me in college thought this was a real panty dropper.

Was talking to her a girl on the subway, we got off to get to class. I for God knows what reason thought, you know if I run really fast like im late for class this girl might be impressed or think it's cute.

I look at my watch and then go... ""Gotta jet, im late!""

I then just take off, with my bookbag on, it made the running even more awkward, and I had to sprint a good minute to get out of sight of this girl.

Im ashamed to say I did this more than once, and one time it was raining and yup I ate the dirt so hard."
"It's easy to make plans with her. She acts like she wants you in her life. She either asks if you want to do an activity with her or tells you exactly when she's free to do your activity. 

There's few things more annoying in dating than a woman who is chronically ""busy"" and flakey, and makes no time for you. "
"Back in the AIM days...

Met a girl online who was close to me, and we start talking. I ask her nationality, she tells me she's Indian. 

I asked her ""What tribe?"""
"I just said, ""Hi, Fred. I'd like to propose to Catherine, but I wanted to do you the courtesy of requesting your blessing first, especially since our marriage would involve her emigrating to the US or me immigrating to Australia. Do you have any objections or concerns?""

He just told me that if I broke her heart he'd feed me to the dingos."
"Beer. Everyone thinks I just haven't found the right beer yet, but I absolutely hate the core beer taste."
"&gt;Girl: Hey you look good without your glasses!

&gt;Me: Haha, you don't...

&gt;Girl:  ... oh :(

&gt;~~Me: You just look blurry! ;D~~

...someone interrupted me before I could say the last part. Someone please just fucking kill me now. 😂"
I probably wouldn't have to do anything because my GF would give have slapped him back so hard it would be overkill to add insult to injury.
"It would bother me a fair bit, I like my privacy and I wouldn't appreciate her sharing things like that."
"What I said: ""I'm glad you're not worried about looking pretty like all the other girls I've been with"" 

What I meant: ""It's awesome that you're comfortable with yourself and aren't super insecure about not looking your 100% best all the time"" 

What she heard: ""You're uglier than the many *many* other girls I've been with but it's cool because I don't have to wait for you to get ready everywhere we go"" 

It  went over about as well as you might think... "
"I was living in Japan at the time and my Japanese girlfriend (wife now) were talking about getting married. I had met my future father-in-law once before and that was only very briefly. I entered the house for our first dinner together, had a very nice time and then asked her father if I could marry his daughter. His answer? He told me he'd think about it and give me his answer at a later time. Yikes

A month went by and he finally says yes to our marriage. Years later my wife and I were talking about that and I asked what was it that finally sealed the deal for him? She said that her father appreciated how when I took my shoes off at the front door that I also put them together and placed them on the floor facing outside. It showed that I was serious about respecting her family and her culture. Remember folks, it's the little things! "
Sports. I absolutely hate them and the entire culture around them. 
"I think you should say to yourself, ""Oh, this is not surprising"" and then modify your personal rules about loaning money to friends.

*Money given to friends and family is a gift, not a loan*."
"That's a pretty good idea, I might do that."
I didn't say this but for Valentine's Day I just got her a framed photo of just my face
*Significant* otters.
"My father in law likes me a lot and we've always gotten along. 

We were at a family wedding (wife is Irish catholic, there are a *lot* of family weddings) and I took him aside and said I planned to propose and that I'd like his blessing. He hugged me and said I had it, and not to tell her mother or else everyone in the family would know by the end of the week. "
"I was a virgin and I asked a girl to lose it by saying:

&gt; Wanna break me in?

It still hurts."
"Another ""not really said so much as did.""

On the first day of bio class my sophomore year of high school, I was seated next to this random girl. I was a pretty shy high schooler, so I didn't say anything or acknowledge her for the entire class because I couldn't think of a good way to do it. 

When there was about ten minutes of class remaining, my teacher gave us our homework to start early. I realized I didn't have a pencil, so I decided to ask the girl sitting next to me for one to finally break the ice. I got myself all psyched up, went over exactly what I was going to say, took a deep breath and...whipped my head around way too quickly, inhaled my own spit, and promptly coughed it up onto her homework. I remember looking at the wet mark on her paper, looking up at her, and then just staring at my paper for the remainder of class. 

All these years later and it still hurts to think about."
Because I have a bunk bed and I don't want to get laughed at.

"This was the first time I ever really got wasted. I was at a cousins house party so everyone there was a year or two older although I already knew one or two people. I end up finishing a litre bottle of JD, throwing up and telling my cousin how much I loved her.

Fast forward a little and my cousin and her friends put me to bed. Although to my pleasant surprise they put me in bed with this hot girl I'd been flirting with all night. Being young and drunk it doesn't take long for me to make a move and we start making out.

This is where I hit her with the first load of cringe. ""Hey, sorry if I taste a little of sick, I threw up earlier"". Somehow I ride my luck and things continue and I end up going down on this girl. 

Now I was young and a little inexperienced, it was in fact the first time I'd done it. Needless to say I wasn't very good and she ends up stopping me. As we lay there afterwards I hit her with the most cringe-worthy thing I've ever said to a girl.

""At least I don't taste of sick anymore, now I just taste of you"""
"Most of the women I talk to are very happy to talk about themselves. 

They'll hit me up on text or facebook to talk about themselves.

Then they just stop talking when they're done telling me about this thing they did.

I ignore them now.

Weirdly, though, I had this super attractive friend in high school (well, she's still my friend) and she was always like this. And me and like every other dude fawned over her. Around freshman year of college, I realized all she ever did was dump her emotional baggage on me.

So I stopped talking to her. I was friendly if I saw her in person (rare because she went to college out of state), but otherwise I ignored her existence. 

A few years later, I ran into her at an event we're both always at (fundraiser for the high school team we were both on), and she started having an actual conversation with me. She flat out apologized for not being a very good friend. We now have an actual friendship. "
"We were play wrestling. Good god she was cute. And a rough and tumble kind of girl. I was smitten. We were getting along. She Wolloped me good with a jab, stunned me even. Her big doe eyes and cute giggle made my heart-on melt. I had very little time to decide if I wanted to playfully say ""I'm going to beat the shit out of you"" or ""I'm gonna fuck you up"". My retort, you ask? 

**I'M GONNA FUCK THE SHIT OUT OF YOU**

I'm a 250 lb black guy. She was a 5'2 little raven haired woman. Never saw her again. 


Edit: to my gilder, **YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO YOU ;)** thanks!"
"It sounds like you have an unhealthy relationship with money from most people's point of view, but if you're happy there's no reason to change. Personally, I save quite a bit, but I spend money on quality experiences because they are what bring me happiness rather than toiling away in order to see some numbers that represent the wealth I'll eventually have go up.

*will be very rich upon retirement*

Being rich when you're too old to do a lot of things is not necessarily a great plan. To borrow from Burroughs, who wants to be the richest stiff in some cemetery?

*Is something wrong with me?*

You sound misanthropic, which makes you somewhat unusual but not wrong per se."
Never really took a big interest in cars.
"Talking smack about their girlfriend/wife when they're not around. I mean you are dating or married to the girl; break up with her if she's so bad. It just sounds like whining to me.

Betting on sports and gambling in general which is probably more prevalent in Australian male society than many other parts of the world."
I posted at r/legaladvice. Genuine thanks to mods for letting this in. Off to work for 5 hours now. Too everyone out there I am grateful for responses.
Holy fuck dude... 
If I knew where to meet them I wouldn't be single in my late 20s
"All my life, I have been a full blown stupid loser and a loud asshole. A real mean idiot and a dick. I failed everything I tried. Everybody I know hates me. 

A few years ago, in my *late 40s, I got a diagnostic of vitamin B12  malabsorption and celiac disease. When I started taking my B12 shots and avoiding gluten, I gradually ""woke up"", I stopped being irritable, ""dazed"" and ""groggy"". I completely stopped ""lying"" as I did not need to invent stories anymore to fill in my memory gaps (confabulation), etc. etc.

And it turns out that I'm actually a really good, charming and intelligent guy.

I lost 30 of my best years: education, friends, professional life, family, etc. All gone. And everybody, including myself, thought I was just a loser and a dick. 

Today, I actually wish I never ""woke up"". It's very painful.

**Edit: gals and guys, thank you all for your support and encouragements. I'm in my very early 50s now and doing my best to be alive and live fully.**"
I'm gay. 
"Shit if she's bragging about how good I am she can tell the whole fuckin world. 

If it's about that one time I couldn't get it up, I'm gonna be pissed.

"She and you are having so much fun you both don't want the date to end. Talking about anything and everything flows smoothly. Even the silences are sweet. 

""Restaurant is closing? Let's go to a bar!"" ""Bar is shutting down, how about a movie at my place?"" Where both of you are coming up with excuses to keep it going and not to be apart.

The first few times where that did happen, made me realize that sex really started *earlier*, way before the clothes came off. It's all one process. Dates build tension; sex releases tension.

It's all in the . . .

* teasing each other and making each other laugh.

* lingering touches.

* how we positioned our bodies ever more closely and intimately, our faces leaning toward each other . . .

* the silent looks where we expressed more about wanting each other than if we had said anything.

* when you stand up to leave the bar/nightclub/cafe, she gets up and moves in sync too, and it's unspoken but understood that the next place you're going, you're going together.

A bonus is if you're out with friends, drinking, talking and having fun. You or her step away from the group, and the other later follows. Accidental? Maybe, maybe not. 

Having a ""secret rendezvous"" with your friends none the wiser can be fun and naughty."
"When you disagree about something, it feels like an opportunity for a fun exchange of opinions, rather than a minefield to navigate."
"Keep it vanilla the first few time, then have a grown up conversation, not in the middle of sex about each persons kinks and limits. "
She's 19 months old and frankly I don't feel she's ready for a relationship. 
"I decided to take a chance and ask a girl out in college, she invoked the name of God and said that He wasn't leading her to a relationship any time soon. A week goes by and she makes a Facebook post about how God led her to a relationship with some other guy."
"Hella good...If a gay man thinks you're hot...chances are, lots a ladies think so too."
"Oh yes all the time. 

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence... 
Nigga nigga nigga nigga "
"We dont do cute talk to eachother. We dont call eachother babe or sweety. We have mean talk. Instead of saying ""babe can you please make me something to eat?"", i might say ""BITCH. MAKE ME A MEAL. NOW"". And i say it through clenched teeth.  Shell respond with the same voice and say ""FAT MOTHERFUCKER. YOU DONT NEED MORE FOOD."" And then shell go make me something.

Our pet names for eacher are motherfucker, stupid, cunt, bitch, basterd, dumb ass, dummy, idiot and smelly son of a bitch."
"We go to sleep either face to face, or with one spooning the other, or with me curled into a ball and her curled around me. In some situations also with one of us at least partially atop the other. I put my arms wherever I can fit them.

During the night, stuff happens. Nobody knows exactly what.

In the morning, we sometimes wake up in the shape of a cross, with her lying face-down across me, or with her head over the edge of the bed; sometimes we wake up in an embrace with our arms asleep; sometimes we wake up with my face on her tummy; sometimes we wake up with me lying belly-down on the bed and her on top of my back.

It's a mystery.

"She had blue skin,

"If she initiates stuff. Texts first, asks you out, ect. So many don't at all, it shows enthusiasm and confirms that they actually like me."
Answering questions rather then contributing to a conversation.
"If she wants to deal with it herself, let her. 

Otherwise, security - or friends/bystanders.

The thing all the boneheaded lone-wolf pricks on the 'net miss is that there's authorities to help you for such exact cases, and where there aren't there's safety in numbers. 

We're primally geared to back down when facing a greater number of opponents. And if someone decides to ignore one's instincts, well - I've been personally called to the scene of a young hoodlum starting a fight with a group of 70 year olds by hassling them. End of the story was that he was on the ground with multiple skull fractures, because a dozen upset 70 year olds can reliably kick the shit out of one, even madly ripped, 20 year old."
"In college... was going to walk to class with cute girl on my floor.  Her door is open and as I approach I hear her say to her roommate ""I wish he would just ask me out already.  I don't know how many more signs I can give him.""  To which I walk in and say ”Who is this idiot who can't tell that you're flirting with him?”  

Her roommate starts laughing hysterically and the cute girl turns all shades of red... and I top it off by saying ""Sorry... didn't mean to embarrass you.  Let's go to class so we're not late.""

If it wasn't clear... I was the idiot who didn't read the flirting.  And no... I never asked her out.  I thought WAY out of my league."
"Me: Hey Charlie, I'd like your blessing to marry your daughter.

Charlie: You've met my daughter, right? You sure about that?"
I'd slap his ass and look him straight in the eyes.
"Oh man you're so adorable. I want to give you a hug.

It gets better. Even if you're dating the same woman; if you've chosen well it gets more fun as it goes along because you get more comfortable as it goes along."
"No chemistry. There has to be some level of spark. ""Random hot chick I know nothing about"" doesn't do it for me."
Permanent STDs have accounted for ALL of my refusals to have sex with people.
"Nobody cares. 90% of the time, no one will ever even notice you. In the gym, on the job, in the bar. This will liberate you more than you think it might."
There should be a game show where people guess the top comments from /r/askmen and /r/askwomen a la Family Feud. 
"That's because everyone feels differently about it so it's best for us to just not take the risk. 

Example, from the chorus of Injury Reserve's new song S On Ya Chest (one of /r/hiphopheads' favorite albums a few weeks ago):

&gt; "" What you know about a young nigga like this
&gt; 
&gt; What you know about a young neighbor like this
&gt; 
&gt; I did the second one for the white kids
&gt; 
&gt; Cause I know you wanna say it, but that ain’t right kid""

My friends personally don't care, but I'm not trying to fight a stranger at a party over something stupid. "
It would depend on what it is. If she was telling them some really embarrassing issue that I have - that would bother me.  But if she was just telling them a description of something we did... that wouldn't bother me. 
I laughed too hard at this.
"One time I was on the subway reading ""The Alchemist"" when I noticed a cute girl sitting opposite me who was definitely looking in my direction. 

After two more stops she finally says to me ""that's one of my favourite books it's soo good"". 

I replied with ""oh nice, have you read it""? She got off the next stop.. "

"Happen to me once in college, I walked over and kissed the dude full on the mouth. I know I could take him in a fight but this was the first thing to pop into my head. Needless to say both he and my girlfriend were stunned...dude walked away and my girlfriend at the time break down laughing..."
"I was never a boob guy. I've always liked a great butt. My new special lady friend has the most amazing boobs I've ever seen. They are perfect. They're huge, but also super firm...and the nipples are the right size, color, etc. When she lays down, they just sit there like two beautiful foot hills on the cusp of the Rockies. I was never a boob guy...I am now.   "
"What you gonna do, hire a PI to track down OP and interrogate him+the family? Gotta work with the info we are provided, and the info says they stole shit that didn't belong to them, along with the kidnapping."
"""gotta go faaaast."""
"She bites me. Hard, and kind of tries to get her teeth deep into the muscle fibers. Or she pinches me, grabs me, squeezes. It's kinda painful, and she claims to be various animals while doing this to excuse her behavior. Like biting is what a cookie cutter shark does. I am covered in bite marks and scratches.

She will make my dick talk. She pulls and squeezes on the head to make the urethral open and close while she says words. 

She will randomly demand praise for accomplishing things, both grand and small. What she wants is for me to literally shout the word ""Praise"" to her.

She shoves her cold dead hands under my shirt or down my pants, trying to warm herself up. She'll go for the ""crevices"", so armpits, elbows, etc. Then rather than just warming up her hands, she tries to burrow inside me like done alien parasite. 

I love this woman."
"&gt; There's always two sides to a story

While true, OP came to us for advice for a specific set of details. We can only offer help based on those details. I'd suggest contacting a lawyer before pursuing legal action (ie calling the police) but we can only offer based on what we know, we can't just speculate what there might be hidden. "
"Sounds really fucking dangerous, but I'd probably let it happen anyway because that's just the sort of thing you do when you have a dick."
My girlfriend is a hot coal sheet hog who sleeps on her sides or rolls around mostly while I am more of a Dracula in his coffin kinda guy (I lie on my back and don't move until I wake up). When it comes to sleep we couldn't be more different and we both just need our own space.
"&gt; and she will let you know if she feels uncomfortable.

A few things: I didn't ask for ""permission"" and instead asked for his ""blessing"". The only permission I need was from her. 

I asked her special needs brother if he wanted to me hang around longer and he was excited. I then have her dad the opportunity to ask any and all questions about me (I have been previously married but she cheated and left) and our future plans (I.e. Are we moving away, changing jobs, having babies asap, etc.) without her there. 

They felt comfortable and gave me the blessing. I let them know the timeline on how I was going to ask (surprise trip to New Orleans). 

All is going well so far. Getting hitched in June. Good luck. "
"There's usually one of two things:

a) I be the big spoon and curl up around her like a big ball. 

b) I lie flat on my back with an arm out and she kinda rolls into the crook of my arm and sleeps against my chest. She particularly likes this because I'm soft and squishee and I like it because when she falls asleep I can feel her exhaling on my chest, which is kinda nice."

When I tried to move it forward she would just don't be weird about it. Bitch you just sent me nudes *sober*, you call me up wanting to fuck. 

I hung around in that mess for way too long. She was not a good friend and I don't know why I stuck around. Blinded by tits lads, blinded.

Lastly, quit caring about whether these guys think you're a tease or not. If they don't roll at your speed, they don't. Let them go."

"Noticed with an ex I always texted first, when she started actin funny I thought ill give her space and she can talk when she is ready. 4 days went by and rather than talk to me she made fb statuses pretty much looking for sympathy coz ""not even my bf wants to talk to me""... this is a major deal breaker for me (putting our shit on social media especially a warped version) so being petty i liked the status. A week went by and i messaged her to come see her, just so i could break up with her."
"If your wife asks you what you want for a side dish to go with dinner don't squeeze one of her butt cheeks and say ""how about mashed potatoes?""."
I downloaded this app called PokemonGo. It's a little different than Tinder. I keep swiping but I only match with something called Weedle. 
"""No wonder people have such a hard time living with you""

it was referring to how she always blames herself for everything and panics over things, and shutting herself off to anyone trying to help her. Right as I said it tho..

fuck"
"Sure. It's not a word in my usual vocabulary but I don't feel bad repeating song lyrics.  

Edit just to add:

&gt; if white people sang along to the word if it's In a song if no black people aware around.  

If you mouth off lyrics to a song and censor the N word around any black friend I hang out with, they're going to make fun of you.

  "
I personally don't like casual sex so before I sleep with someone I like to get to know them a bit. I prefer to have some type of emotional connection before sex.
"Sports, It's so incredibly dull. "
"Instead of being constantly distracted by her tits and loving that ass I have come to appreciate the woman behind it all. The fun, silly, adventurous, hard working, intelligent, caring woman that tries to do the right thing, celebrate with people, and doesn't like to feel confined. I love her quirks (and quarks) and find them endearing. She's my best friend and the only one with whom I want to travel the world and spend my life. Plus she has great tits and I love that ass."
Oh damn... I'm so sorry. I feel like I've been very lucky to have been completely oblivious in every similar situation like that I've been in so I don't have to live with knowing about it. 
... no :(
"The entire culture of spectator sports is something I find weird.

Sports are something that seem as though you should take part in them. I used to play rugby, do cross country running, swimming, fencing, etc. Loved taking part, but sports as a spectator has to be one of the most mind-numbingly dull things I've ever witnessed. 

Same with those who watch others play video games on services like Twitch.

Edit: For those who keep giving me reasons why watching sports/games isn't weird, refer to the top where I said that **I find it weird**. I am not saying that it being weird is a definitive truth, just that it's my opinion, just as your opinion may be that it's not weird."
"I just cringed.  I would've understood what you really meant, but at the same time I'd still be second guessing.  :/"
"I kept waiting for ""the right moment"" to make a move. "
"Yeah, she really wanted to maintain a friendship after the breakup (found out she still had feelings for me later on). Knowing this, I really didn't think it was a good idea, hence me trying to keep her out of my life. I started to question the ""convenience"" of her relocation. "
"I was in a 2 year relationship before I decided to join the military. As soon as I left for boot camp my SO cheated on me, got into a relationship with the other person, had a kid, they actually hated each other so they didn't work out. The person my ex-SO cheated on me with was actually friend of mine. They were at my going away party. They had the audacity to use the name my ex-SO and myself decided we were going to use if we ever had a kid. So yeah that stung a bit. After that happened I of course cut them out of my life. I am happier now. "
"Dude, thats not cringeworthy. That's hillarious as fuck."
"Woman here, but I've gotten so into blowjobs that I didn't notice until the next day that I actually bruised the back of my throat. 

This has happened four times..."
"They want to try new things with you. The best date I've ever been on is taking a girl who didn't know anything about baseball to a baseball game. The next best was her brining me to a ballet. The ballet wasn't interesting at all, but it was awesome seeing her explain something she was passionate about. I'm sure it was the same the other way around at the baseball game. "
"This makes me cringe so damn much even thinking about it. 

Well he it goes.

I was at a bar one night and they had a beautiful girl sitting next to me with her friends. I ordered them beers out of the blue, and all was well and I was thanked.
Well apparently I had drank to much and got a little bit over confident. I saw she was snap chatting someone on her phone so in my mind this was the greatest thing I could tell her. 
"" Do you want me to make someone jealous by taking a picture with me?"" 

Currently cringing at the moment

She said no and then it was an awkward silence.
So I casually left and went to another area.

Haven't been back there since.  

EDIT: I did not know this girl at all. And what I said was the first and last thing I ever told her. "
"He didn't say a trial attorney, he said a private one, as opposed to a legal aid one, which is only available if you meet certain criteria that vary by province. This was said in regard to the property issue though, not with regards to the custody/kidnapping and OP might very well be able to get help for this whether through legal aid or persons/measures designed to help crime victims (OP, please check whether your legal aid lawyer can help you with that).

OP, I'm so sorry for your loss and the way your in-laws are treating you. I'm not a lawyer but would also advise taking your kids back ASAP or asking them for your kids back. If they refuse, inform them you will call the police to report your children abduction and will be pressing charge for this crime as well as for the thefts (not as a threat). But call your lawyer first to get better advice.

I don't know if you are currently living in your house or want to but if you aren't and you want to, you are more than likely entitled to it. 

""Broken up"", which I understand you weren't but your in-laws claim is the case, isn't a legal status for married couples, at least in my province. Divorced, *legally* separated or having filed for divorce with a pending case might affect succession and survivor's right but ""I was away for 3 days"" shouldn't. (Again, to be confirmed with an actual lawyer)"
"We try to stick our fingers in each other's mouth.

"Hey, u/zackysquire ... I don't know what you should do, I'm just a random person on the internet.

But I wanted to share how deeply sorry I am for your loss. Please don't beat yourself up over it, even if the last things said to each other weren't loving. She got you, dude. You know she did. 

When the dust has settled, and the logistics of funeral and family have played out, you'll have time to confront your own personal loss. Unfortunately, being the man means being the problem solver, and it really comes out during times like these. So in those long dark hours when you stare out the window at three AM wondering why you can't get over it ...

Go see a grief counselor. I swear dude. They'll give you tools to cope. You'll need help coping. 

Again, sorry for your loss. "
I just had an image in my mind of dingos providing low-cost STD screening and handing out condoms
"Alaska. Only reason I'm not there now is I'm still single and like getting laid. My plan is to find an outdoorsy girl, get married, and move to Alaska. It's a bring your own girl state."

"Acknowledge you're a sexual being.  

Acknowledge you have other shit to do.

Have sex and masturbate regularly :o"
"It's a bit retroactive, but it was probably that time. We were having a big fight at night, and it was getting late. Up until now, we had often followed a rule to resolve conflicts before going to bed. We also had always slept in the same bed when under the same roof since we were together.

It was getting late and the next day she had a presentation to do that she had worked on for months. She needed to have a decent night of sleep. My heart sank but I decided to call it was time to get some sleep for the night, and I'd sleep on the couch. She followed and asked what I was doing, we don't sleep separately. I explained she can't mess with her sleep schedule, not today, and she didn't listen. So I was like, 

""what's more important, the presentation you worked on for three months, or an unbroken record of sleeping in the same bed?""

""You!""

... Oh my god.
"
"In college once I somehow managed to call a girl I was sleeping with ""Mom""...

Yeah, I thought I might die from embarrassment. I still have no idea why that came out of my mouth.

Thankfully she got over it and we still fucked pretty often after that."
Also don't fuck with farmers. They have farm strength and tend not to take any bullshit
"Sometimes my SO will say something and I'll say something that rhymes with it and we will keep trying to rhyme with the last word said until we can't think of anything anymore.
 
Example: ""I think this wall color needs more saturation""

""Maturation""
""Masturbation""

It gets obnoxious after a while.

"One word answers and no passion for anything. I don't care if it's knitting, be passionate about something!"
"Attracting girls physically. I have no trouble talking to them, approaching them, etc. Girls apparently really like me, feel really comfortable around me, and genuinely want to spend time with me, but when I ask them out, they'd rather just be friends. Some of those girls I ended up staying friends with, and I asked them why they said no when I asked them out. It's been pretty much a universal ""I'm not attracted to you."""
"Because of the family situation her father was not in the picture and so I ended-up asking her mother for her blessing. 

I had recently lost my job due to the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s. So I started going on about how I was going to look for a job, would be able to support Margaret, etc., etc. My now mother-in-law simply replied ""you make Margaret happy, go propose."""
"Yes, I've had girls say they don't want me to ask, but just do. Then when I do, they don't like what I do. Super annoying. "

So Suzie is such a bitch, she knew I wanted Tuesday off but then moved her thing with her friends to Tuesday and the boss likes her so..."
"Nah, simply a crowd of old farmers returning from a farmer's market.

The young rascal started pushing one of them around. Another fogey didn't take much time to think it over and simply kicked the young hoodlum in the back of the knee with the wooden shoes farm-lads tend to wear here. The young fellow crouched down for a second as a result of that blow, and they literally kicked the shit out of him with wooden shoes until he stopped moving.

Just so I'm being perfectly clear here: I don't condone violence; it just goes to show that an agitated mob of weak individuals can easily screw over a solitary, strong individual."
"The guys in this thread are so fucking stupid. Asking in the heat of the moment is not a great idea because it can ruin it but guys....if you have to ask, ask in a way so that she only has to give a Yes or a No answer. Just keep it simple, stupid"
"Inability to flirt back or make jokes back. I give it a while to see if they open up, but if they never do, it's a bad sign. If we're together for a long time, there will be times the only things we can say to each other are jokes or flirty things. They need to be able to play off me or let me play off them. Otherwise it's just not fun."
Never. It's a pretty good experience.

"In my second year of uni I was looking at this sweet loft bed from ikea, I liked it because my room was tiny and this way I could fit a desk underneath my bed.

"Well my wife's dad was dead, but I still wanted to do this, so I asked her mom. 

I was very to the point. Just called and said I wanted to do the traditional thing and ask permission. She was happy and said yes. 

The bonus to this was she knew my wife preferred sapphire to diamonds and told me, which helped a lot with ring shopping. "
I told her I wasn't excited about our baby while she was pregnant. This didn't mean I was reluctant or uncaring; I just didn't feel actual excitement. I was treating it like an event to prepare for. 
"Too real, I'm bailing out of the joke"
"I can't remember why I was getting dressed up, but a couple of years ago my ex did something like this. I got ready in the bathroom and didn't come out until I was done. I had on a dress, did my makeup/hair, heels, the whole thing. I walked into the doorway of his ""mancave"" and stood there trying to look all sexy and what not. He turned in his chair, looked at me, and said ""You look like a high class prostitute.""

He could not understand why I didn't appreciate the compliment.

He said don't ask... Now look what you've done.
"No hobbies, not engaging in conversations, too focused on social media etc."
"Look at him and say, ""Really, dude?"" If he's looking for a fight, grab GF and leave. 

If he attacks, get his attention while my GF glasses him from behind. She's feisty.

"The last ""date"" I was on was like this, I asked all the questions she happily did most of the talking. She even acknowledged it, almost like, tee hee, I hope I'm not talking too much, but here I go talking about myself again. Then she tried to sign me up for a pyramid scheme. If she'd learned more about me she'd know I'm not selfish/stupid enough to fall for that."
"My ex boyfriend once said to me, in the middle of sex/oral, ""I used to think vaginas like yours were boring""

I mean, I get that this kind of a backhanded compliment, but honestly I spent the rest of the session thinking ""what does he mean by 'vaginas like yours'?"". Then I figured he meant flaps/no flaps. Then I felt like shit because I had never thought about how a guy might have a preference for flaps/no flaps. Then I felt sad that my boyfriend or any other guy may have not liked my flaps/no flaps that much.

#flapsnoflaps

Also said to me that he preferred brunettes with dark features, whereas I had blonde hair a mild tan. In his defence, he says he was talking about dark eyes and eyebrows, of which I have both. Later saw him googling 'black girl porn', so who really knows."

"Well the obvious answer here, reading your explanation, is to approach dating as an investment as well. An investment in finding the right person. The only difference is that once you find what has the best ROI, you can invest everything in that one relationship.      However, before that, you will make a lot of poor investments in people that do not work out. There are ways to minimize these costs though. Things like only doing drinks as a first date (low amount of time, low cost, and can always be extended) and finding someone who shares your values about money. And even these failures will help you be better at finding the right person. If I got a refund for every failed date, it would easily be thousands, but I would also not have the knowledge of how to make better ""investments"" and ask out women I think I will have better relationships with.   Let me warn you though that there is a real difference between being careful about money and how you invest it, and being cheap. And I guarantee you that if your attitude and habits come off as cheap, you will see great women leave you.  Even getting down to brass tacks with you, I had the highest standard of living in my life when I lived with a partner. We split the bills 50/50 and I had enough to do all kinds of stuff and still save like 20% of my take-home pay. I am definitely not living that way since we broke up. So if you find someone that you genuinely like first and foremost, the money will fall in line."

"I think it's unoriginal because I may have seen it ages ago on here, but I got my cum and wiped it on her forehead while I called her Simba.

I bit her earlobe, would nibble really. Got her to laugh and it was a turn on but I'd randomly do it at the oddest times. 

I would do ballet while she cooked, just twirl around the kitchen humming and I would spin her when she was cooking and lean her down and kiss her. We danced a lot. We'd also bump our asses together if we did food prep. Also I'd hump her from behind during some of this really fast. 

I'd randomly come in while she was in the shower to wash her back and then leave. She didn't ask me I'd just go. 

On a sex side sometimes I'd be feeling really horny but really dominant and I'd throw her on the bed and pin her down on her stomach and pull her panties down. She liked it and we had a safeword if she ever had too much which was never. I would pin her and she'd be soaking wet and I'd slide in and fuck her how I want. If she tried to rub her clit I wouldn't let her and I would cum. It turned her on so much so the next time we had sex would be epic. 

She was American and recently moved back just yesterday and I'm really upset about it actually.

"Frank, I'm planning to propose to your daughter. We have been together 5 years, and we are really in love, and I know she wants to get married. I just wanted to have your blessing before proposing, as you are very important to her, and me. 

He patted me on the back, and said we should go get a beer, saying things like this can't be discussed completely sober. He asked a few questions about logistics, money and we were good.

I don't like the concept of asking for permission. It's my gf's choice, not his. Just blessing. I asked her Mom for blessing, too. "

"Do you claim him as your own?

"She (in a roundabout way) asked me what I thought of her. Then proceeded to tell me how mature she was compared to other girls her age(gave various 14 year old ""logic"" reasonings)  and that she has always been attracted to older men. She asked me if I was dating anyone and If she could come over to my house sometime. I kinda live about 1,000 miles away from the rest of my family and told her so. She then asked if she could come visit me...

I pretty much noped the fuck out of that conversation right about then. It happened in the living room and my cousin was in her kitchen listening to every word. Didn't even know she was there until I walked in and she gave me a thumbs up and told me she would handle it."
"Nineteen Eighty-Four, despite it's rep amongst the faux intellectuals, is a really good book. As is Brave New World.

Also can recommend Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, The Man In The High Castle, and House of Leaves. For that last one, get the physical book, not the eBook version. Hardback, ideally, to keep all the pages nice. Page layout is important with that one.

"This is an interesting post because I remember this other post (on a different sub ) about a couple who got mugged and the guy ran off and left the girl.

She ended up breaking up with him.

I had a guy do this to me and my bf who is 5'5"" and 112 lbs soaking wet looked the guy right in the eye and said ""you touch her again and I will throw you through a plate glass window"" The other guy apologized and said he did not realize we were together. My bf is never going to be the biggest or tallest but he is tough , I respect the heck out of him. "

"Nah, you're forgetting the traumatized kids.  The last thing they need right now is to see this family in-fighting. 

He should, however, show up, and try to manage the situation calmly.  Acknowledge that the in-laws were acting from love and grief.  Explain that he was also deeply grieving and in shock.  But he has come for his kids and his belongings.  

If they refuse, then he says: ""I'm not asking.  This is what is happening tonight.  You need to decide if it's going to happen with the police standing in your living room while it happens.""

Then he calls the police and reports a kidnapping only if they're stupid enough to fight him on this.

"I love talking to strangers at bars, especially after a few drinks. However, I recently got out of a 3 year relationship so most of the time I was usually talking to other random dudes and not women. My friends usually would joke around with me that I've gotten more dudes phone numbers than girls (usually meet up to go golfing or something). 

I'm not an anxious person but I'm definitely one of those half introvert, half extrovert type of people. Depending on my mood I feel like I could talk to anyone."

That's that rough period we all go through where you have *just* enough game for the set up... but not quite enough game to close the deal.
"To me it's always been a very fine line determining what is an adequate amount of asking about you. I think people enjoy more talking about themselves and truthfully I'm pretty ok with that. I don't really feel the need to vent my emotions and feelings on every subject so if they want to fill the silence that's ok.

But then comes the time you want to talk about yourself, are they willing to listen and produce feedback? Do they care? 

I don't really mind say 70:30. But some people are 100:0."

"I don't get that, it's sad. My (douchebaggy) brother says the same stuff, with reasoning like ""Well I don't want some gay dude raping me."" 

And when I try to explain ""Do women try to rape you? Then don't flatter yourself, gay guys probably aren't that attracted to you either"" he doesn't get it. (Yeah yeah, rape and attraction don't necessarily have anything to do with each other, I know.)

My mom told her that was wrong, my dad said she's my sister so I should just let her have it. My relatives also felt like my sister did nothing wrong, and told me that I'm an asshole for expecting it back. I'm 23 and I still haven't gotten paid back, yet I still bring it up everytime she comes to visit. "

"&gt; Would you ever tell her you liked her too and then invite her to sleep over, fall asleep cuddling, just to be nice?

No. That's the opposite of being nice.

I'd try to let her down as gently and delicately as I could, but ultimately, there'd be no dancing around the issue that *I only like her as a friend*."
I feel that most men don't like doing this. Eventually we all get lonely enough to try it though.
"I love Irish weddings. My paternal grandmother is Irish (one of 18 kids - 12 made it to adulthood). That side of my family is FUCKING GIGANTIC, easily pushing 100+ family members. But they're a riot, especially when they've been drinking.

"Here's the deal - living at the behest of other people's insecurities gets old *really* fast. I tend to lose interest when someone starts setting up rules or playing gatekeeper with intimacy. I've always held to a ""you are responsible for owning your shit"" philosophy. Whatever insecurities I have are my problem and my problem alone. I don't expect anyone else to alter much of their lives to accommodate them. 

If you need time, you had better be specific about how much time you need. Otherwise, it's just going to feel like you're leading a guy on. You aren't going to find a lot of guys with a healthy sense of self worth who are going to be willing to wait around while you make up your mind. There are other fish in the sea who aren't going to make them jump through hoops.

So don't be vague. Be up front about what you need and how you feel. You might not get the response you want, and it may rule out a fair number of guys. If it does, then that's just a sign they aren't the right ones for you."
"Not a said, a did. A girl I'd had a crush on for ages...I scored the game winning goal in my soccer game. Big celebration, running around, high fives and ass grabbing.

She came running at me with arms wide for a huge hug. I was so pumped on adrenalin from the game I just gave her a dual-high five and ran away celebrating.

"In my opinion, it all really depends on your situation.

As you stated: You live in NYC and rent is expensive over there. And from what I've read, it seems your long term girlfriend didn't seem to care that you lived with your parents. So long as you explain to your dates your situation, I'm sure they'd understand.

If anything, it's the fact that you travel a lot that might hurt you more. "

Being in the closet is probably my most ironclad deal breaker. 
Why?
Personalitities.
"Oh, I had an ex-girlfriend who did a lot worse.

She kept taking pictures and videos of me naked, and then circulated them around our group of friends, without my consent.

She did a lot of things that I didn't agree to... Such as talking me into pay for a weekend away, under the pretense that we would be able to spend some decent time together... only for her to break away the first chance she got to hook up with her ex-girlfriend who lived nearby. She even went so far as to text me about their kinky shenanigans whilst I sat waiting in the hotel...

And then when I cut her out of my life, I'm the bad guy. I become a pariah amongst our shared friends, and her ex-girlfriend does everything she can to ruin my reputation.

She is a big part of the reason why I stay single these days."
"That it's entirely possible to fail at the entire thing. You can fail at jobs, fail at relationships and wind up single and alone at an unemployable age with a mountain of health problems and woefully lonely.

It's important to build everything around your abilities. If you're 19 and hate school, you might never be a doctor. There's nothing wrong with that but don't waste a decade of your life reaching for something that you don't really want. Find what makes you happy early-it's better to have a stable 5 figures in something you enjoy that be miserable your whole trying to hit some quota you may never achieve.

Your odds of finding an Aubrey Plaza lookalike who wants to watch you play CSGO for 8 hours and rewards you with blowjobs are pretty low. Find a girl you're really compatible with and enjoy being around, quit putting pressure on yourself to hold out for fantasies that will never happen.

It was weird when I had a crush on her, because on top of the whole aspect of crushes where you think they're amazing, she's kind of objectively amazing."
"Yea, the prevailing sentiment on that sub AND among my friends is that it's not a biggie.

"Woman here, but I had something similar-ish happen. Guy was a mutual crush in high school, but the stars never aligned for us to hook up. We're both in our mid-twenties now and keep in touch sporadically. He waited until after he got married a couple years ago to tell me he had a crush on me as well and regretted not being able to work something out before committing to his ""psycho, libido-lacking wife.""

High school me would have been devastated and disappointed. Adult me feels that I dodged a 50 cal bullet. Either way, the gods are cruel. 

Oh, and of course I was single and miserably bored when he did that. "
"Ah, yes, I see you're visited by the body moving gremlins as well.

I love hunting. I enjoy it for both sport and food. I just don't buy into spending so much money on camo and leases.

"Going to college.

In High School I had shit social skills, never got invited to parties, friends would regularly hang out with each other and ""forget"" to invite me, that sort of thing.

After a month of college I was a campus celebrity.  Turns out that when I am invited to parties, I'm the life of the party.  I was respected by my professors, admired by my peers, I even got to start a pretty sweet band.

It wasn't perfect, I still had a lot of personal issues, but the change was like night and day.  I remember going back home and hearing someone I used to know comment on how I used to be all ""violin and videogames"".  Nah dude, you just never gave me a chance to be anything else."

Next day, I asked if she wanted to meet up for coffee (I didn't even use the word ""date"") and she responded with several paragraphs about how she thought I was a great guy, but didn't want to lead me on, she's really picky, she doesn't experience attraction until she really knows someone, blah blah blah. I felt like she was trying to shut me down before I even made a move. So, I just didn't respond. She wasn't exactly a 10, at any rate: kinda overweight, with a kid.

"No signs really. But a dude from her work would ask to go to one on one lunches all the time, sure cool whatever, I have opposite sex co workers I'll grab coffee lunch with too.

This escalated to one on one dinners...okay raising eyebrows here...didn't want to be that boyfriend....yet. If something was off she'd say so....right?

Straw that broke the camels back was a drunken planned night with them one on one, I wasn't told about it. He drove specifically ""so she could get drunk, because she had a rough week."" Woke up the next day to no good night text, odd at the time. Then at around 11AM, got a flurry of ""miss you baby, love you baby"" ""how are you?"" ""So sorry I didn't answer earlier."" All seemed odd and slightly guilt ridden, then she ended up spilling the beans and that she got too wasted and left her phone in said co workers car and doesn't remember much.

We lasted two months longer roughly. 1 month after break up she is dating said co worker. They were married roughly 6 months later.

I never found out if she actually cheated. But I think something happened. Crazy part is she asked me point blank if I wanted them to stop hanging out which I said no. We were a terrible fit anyways, so I'm okay with it.

So what are the signs? Usually other persistent males, lies of omission, questionable behavior, etc."

"As many others have said, ask for a blessing, not permission. A blessing says ""I respect you and want you to know I plan to be part of this family"" - unless you are getting a dowry , you don't need authorization from him for marriage. 

I asked both my FIL and MIL for a blessing, she is part of the family too and it really made her happy to be treated as equals. Funny story - I was in a NJ hotel at the time for work, they were in California at a retreat for wine makers. I scheduled a time to talk over Skype and they immediately knew something was up. 

So they start talking among all the other wine makers about what I could be asking them. The room broke into two groups - either I was reaching out about marriage or I was going to ask them for a loan. 

So we have our talk, I tell them their daughter is the best thing in my life, I ask for their blessing, they cry , they say yes I have their blessing. I find out later that when they got off of Skype with me they walked into a room of a dozen other folks and yelled ""it wasn't a loan!"" And everyone poured champagne and toasted them and us for most of the night.

Brand new little black dress, flawless wedding day level makeup, actually did my hair, mani, pedi the works! I came down stairs relishing the mental image I had of his jaw hitting the floor. He litteraly just glanced at me (Not even eye contact) and looked right back at the TV and said ""ready?"" I never put that much energy into a date night again for the next 5 years. And before anyone chimes in with the ""men hate having to wait crap"" I was 20 minutes ahead of schedule. "

"Haha, I have had multiple girls tell me no and then explicitly state that they're not into Asian men, so I suspect that plays some role in it. But I've also dated plenty of girls before, so I realize that there are still plenty of women that don't care about that. 

And I have asked before. One of the girls that stated she wasn't attracted to Asian men is actually one of my better friends. And she's not the only one I've asked, but most of my friends would rather be polite than offer criticism that might hurt my feelings. My hypothesis is that being Asian and short is really hurting my value in a primarily white town, but my female friends say that it isn't an issue. But then again, they're almost all exclusively dating tall white guys, so it's hard not to focus on that."

"Don't escalate sexually and then deny, for starters.

That's apparently a rookie mistake a lot of young girls make, thinking that men all enjoy almost fucking but then stopping like they do.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, please use line and paragraph breaks.

&gt;Anyone have any advice?

Well, off the cuff after reading your OP, don't make a habit of sleeping in his bed when you're not comfortable with him and think you'd regret having sex with him.  That's really something that should be avoided.

You need to be aware that many guys who aren't still in middle school don't especially like repeatedly making out and never going beyond that.  So you should probably discuss your boundaries with him if you're serious about him, and agree upon where to leave things off to avoid giving him blue balls or frustrating him.

However, you need to avoid falling into a trap of thinking that this is a one and done conversation and that you can rest on your laurels without progressing things both physically and romantically.

&amp;nbsp;

The simple fact of the matter is that you're going to have to get comfortable with your sexuality, being sexual with others, and recognizing when you're comfortable doing so, as well as what barriers stand between your comfort and whether they're issues within yourself you need to resolve, a red flag telling you to investigate the relationship and possibly break things off, or simply a need to get to know one another better, in which case you should actually invest in doing so."
Getting blowjobs.  Never have liked them.  Never will.  Would much rather go down on a woman or fuck her than get a BJ.  Don't ask me why.

"There's no such thing as min-maxing life.  A person can be smart, attractive, charismatic, and strong.  Another person can be dumb, ugly, whatever the opposite of charismatic is, and weak.

In spite of what my 10-year-old self believed, abstaining from ""jock"" activities didn't make me smarter.  In fact studies associate physical activity with some cognitive benefits.

In the same vein you're not going to be happy your entire life.  Your brain just doesn't work that way.  Even if you do manage to solve all your problems?  Ennui.  Your ability to be happy is regulated by neurochemistry, and there is no perpetual chemical reaction of joy.  You're going to have lows, recognize them and try to be thankful for what you have."
I love that woman.

A large part of myself is reserved for myself, this is not to say I don't open up and tell people secrets and stuff, but there are plenty of things I wouldn't tell anyone, things that I feel are a part of me and only me.

Call me someone with trust issues, but if there's anything I'm afraid of, it's that people know these things and use them against me, tell someone else about them (be it a best friend or whatever). It'd take a long ass time until I open up to someone completely and they know everything about me. It's easy to say most people are decent people and wouldn't do things like that, but there are shit people out there and those decent people might do those things if things went bad between us. I wouldn't risk it.

edit:
Why is it unacceptable for me? I would feel very uncomfortable going to this man's home to spend time with him and sleep there with his parents there. It is a personal comfort level thing for me and if that makes me some kind of judgmental bitch, that's fine. I also don't want to date anyone with kids-- be sure to liken me to a gold digging whore trying to keep up some kind of image for that too while you use your parents ""other homes along their main estate"" to live in.
