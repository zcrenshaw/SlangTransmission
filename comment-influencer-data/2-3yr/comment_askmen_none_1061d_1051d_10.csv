Count your blessings that you aren't on the hook for several decades of child support for this child that wasn't yours and move on with your life. 
"I once fucked a pile of grain at a farm. 

I enjoyed the feeling of being surrounded by it, so I fucked it. 

Edit.. didn't think this was that weird. Apparently it is. "
I guess that's a plus. 
"cut your losses and get the hell out. Once a cheater, always a cheater."
That men are sex-crazed animals who can't control their urges.
"I hate the dumb, fat, bumbling, horny TV dad.     I may be all of those sometimes, but not all at once.     "
"Holy shit, what a shitty situation. You're going to get a ton of good advice in this thread, and it'll be a lot better than mine but here's mine anyway just in case.

Lawyer. Now. Work out what rights you have if you decide to leave the property - there may be some bullshit law meaning that by doing so you forfeit any right to a division of the assets or some shit, I don't know, which is why you need to pick up the phone to a lawyer this instant. [EDIT: If like OP you can't afford to retain a lawyer, most firms offer individual consultations AFAIK, and if there is a citizen's advice service locally you can use those too.] Once you have worked out whether you can leave the property without losing all your stuff and your share of the value, go someplace else. Record yourself leaving, if she smashes up the place and calls the cops you're going to need to prove that when you left everything was in good order. Then wherever you go make sure people or security systems can vouch for your whereabouts *at all times.* 

I know this sounds paranoid as fuck, but she is not in a good place and you need to protect yourself in case she goes full nuclear. I have read about things like this going from awful to unimaginably terrible in 24 hours flat, with cops and criminal charges and beatings from her white knights etc. She's just had a miscarriage and is desperately fucking some guy in a hotel room, you should assume she is capable of anything.

Once you are in a secure location and you are sure of your rights, then take a few breaths and think about how this is going to play out. Do you want to give her a second chance? I personally would not, as this is next level betrayal. But if so, let her know that if she wants to talk then you're open to it. Leave the ball in her court, she may have already ended it in her mind.

If it disintegrates, make sure you are never alone with her until all the messy proceedings are concluded. When you pick up your belongings, take someone with you - anyone. Record everything.

The best thing I can say is to talk to a lawyer, they'll tell you how to be on the right side of the law - and once you're in a good place there you can think about how you want to be on the good side of the breakup or whatever else you decide to do.

Take care, and remember: foresight and preparation are what will get you through this without it ruining your life.

I will be reading the other answers with great interest.

EDIT: As /u/PleasureOrgan said, get tested for STD's. The rest of his advice is also great."
Standard etiquette is to wait until an arch-enemy has kidnapped them and is dangling them over a pit o' peril.
"This isn't the right question to ask, because there are huge underlying questions that need to be adressed first.

Note that in the sardine episode, the professor refers to them as having gone ""Extinct. Gone the way of the dodo, *or your primitive notions of modesty*,"" at which point he strips naked in public. Couple that with high technology, fully immersive VR systems, a host of alien species, and porns masquerading as educational documentaries (the trash ball episode) and you first need to determine **What is the nature of porn in the universe**?

Only once we have answered that question can we then determine ultraporn.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger. If you need me, I'll be in the chamber of understanding."
"Honest answer, I would say porn that uses some sort of VR or brain hookup that convinces your body that what's happening in the porn is literally happening to your body.  You feel it, even though no one is touching you.  You lie on your bed with some dummy body pillow but in reality you feel the real thing, and are convinced you are actually porking some hot alien chick.  Maybe a tentacle from her shoulder gently caresses your asshole, I don't know.  "
"So I was about to answer this question because, for like my whole life, I've jumped from crush to crush. I don't remember a point when I didnt ""like"" someone. So I clicked reply and started to brainstorm a bit, I realized that there is no one. I'm not stressing about impressing ANYONE right now. Thanks for that OP. I needed it lol"

"It depends on the dynamic of my relationship to them.

Quick anecdote: During the first year that I had anybody reporting to me, I had a woman on my team who was super chill nearly 100% of the time. Nothing seemed to faze her. She was my most reliable and level-headed direct report.

One day, during our monthly one-on-one meetings, she broke down crying. Things had been piling up in her personal life that he had never spoken to me about. It was the first time I had been directly presented with this kind of situation (female coworker crying and being super vulnerable in front of me with nobody else around).

While I was initially thrown off for a few seconds, I just kind of followed my instincts. I put my hand on her shoulder and said, ""I'm sorry. That sounds really tough. I'm here to support you.""

It ended up being a nice turning point in our working relationship. There was more trust, more interpersonal comfort -- more humanity. And it was a nice trial-by-fire for me in learning how to be supportive of my colleagues and the people working for me.

TL;DR - Be there, be kind, be a human."
I was 17 and home alone. Horny as fuck. It was a warm summer day and my home had a large secluded yard that the neighbors couldn't see because of a lot of trees. So I stripped off all my clothes and decided to run around the yard circling the house naked. Since I was horny I was also fully erect as I began walking outside the house. I came to the corner of the house in the back yard and turned to walk up the side yard when I came across a female deer in the upper yard. I stopped in my tracks and she stood still looking at me. I was about 50 yards away from her. Standing naked with a full erection. So I just began to wank in front of her and came rather quickly. It was weird but I never forgot that. 
"Was in long distance relationship as well. She gave me her favorite stuffed animal, an owl, and I'd make sure it was pointed in her direction how ever many miles away she was so he could watch over her at night."
Trimmed or none.  
"Why are we expected not to like 'girly' drinks? Who gets to decide what's girly and what's not? 

I'll tell you what - as long as it tastes good and I can get drunk on it, it's OK in my book."
"I drive one all the time.  
It depends on the truck.  

Our engine has an Allison automatic in it.  It goes ok.  

Our tanker has 8LL in it.  It's fuckin fun, lights going, slamming gears, lanyard style air horns with chromed  bells.  Most guys can run the automatic, but not many can slam gears, run the siren, air horns and radio while smiling.  I grin every time I start it.  "
TIL There are people in America that ate Metallicock3000's cumbread.
"At the time, without having anyone sit you down and explain that certain things are not legal, the train of thought is ""I'd like to see naked girls my own age."" It's one of the main reasons that parents *need* to talk to their children about porn rather than just being prudes and ignoring the subject all together until it becomes a serious issue, or just saying ""porn is bad and so is sex"" and not ever delving deeper into the matter.  

I grew up in a very conservative Christian Southern family. Both my parents completely screwed up in regards to teaching about sex."
It's real. Love yourself because you cannot build a home on quicksand. 
"I was on a pub crawl and everybody got a shirt with a picture of their face on it.  The organiser asked for ugly pictures, I was the only person that pulled an ugly face.  Everybody else was either pouting, smiling, winking, or sticking their tongue out a tiny bit - while I was looking like I was about to betray Leonidas.

A girl at the bar sees the picture and says ""I can't tell if you're good looking or just good looking compared to that picture"" and she's blocking the picture with her hand and trying to figure it out.  Eventually she makes her decision and she says ""yeah, you're good looking."" like she was pleasantly surprised."
"15 y/o me jacked  off to my hot 27 year old cousin sister who shared a bed with me on new years eve. 

Did it right besides her 

She has no clue or she does but its in the past now.

Edit : This happened in asia,not west Virginia. "
"I make [animal shaped sandwiches](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4041/4550167803_5fdda1e4c7.jpg) for my GF, so she wakes up to a cutesy breakfast."
"Bought a tiny dictionary and circled every nice word in it. Then wrote ""what you mean to me"" on the cover and gifted it to my girlfriend. Been married to her for 8 years now."
Cousin sister.  .  . This explains everything. 
At first it would be weird. Then I would imagine reasons why she would ask that and conclude that she would like to fuck. Which leads to me agreeing to take a test if she does the same. Let's go do the tests together why not?

"Way back when both me and the internet were still young, and we didn't really know what was legal and what wasn't, I might have been jacking it to some illegal material."
You fucking suck at financial planning holy shit
"I love that specifying it was a female deer was important. ""bruh I'm not deer-gay"" "
"I'm sure there have been some real winners, but most of them boil down to ""how do I get a guy to like me without talking to him, making a move, or changing anything I'm already doing?"""
"Depends. When I'm seeing a girl or felt good about my interactions with a girl, I get this weird high where I feel like that. Once she ends up ghosting or something, I feel the latter sometimes. I think we all need to have that mentality of not so much the highs and lows, but just if a girl wants you, then that's cool. If not, that's cool too"

"Leave now. Hire a lawyer and sell the condo. Have the lawyer handle all communication with her.

As of this moment, she's never going to see you again. You must willfully make this decision, and stick to it. 

She will beg for you to come back in a day or two. Ignore it, or have her message forwarded to your lawyer. You must ignore her; she will attempt to manipulate you again. 

You win."
"Therapy is definitely something I suggest. My aunt and uncle went through the same troubles and their therapist helped them out quite a bit. 

Even if it's the hardest thing in the world, at least go outside and sit in the sun. "
"I keep my shit together when things go wrong.

I handle the hard stuff.

I be the unwavering rock in the face of adversity that she wants.

I take care of the house.

I'm a good father to our son.

I keep ""dating"" her, despite being married for 11 years.

I work hard to make things better for our family.

I fuck her right, fuck her often, and I make sure to throw in some spontaneity.

I hit the gym, keep in shape, and maintain my appearance to make sure I *stay* fuckable.

I let her know as often as possible that she's one of the best things that ever happened to me."
"Understanding/excited. Understanding because I don't want stds either, excited because it implies that sex is in my very near future.  "
"&gt;didn't offer to reschedule.

I read that as, ""Not interested. Move on.""

If she was interested AND at able/willing to initiate (both requirements for me), she'd have offered an alternate time or option. Or even invited you to ask after X date.

So, either she's uninterested, or expecting you to do all the planning and pursuing.

Either way, dude, pass."
Sort of I guess. When I worked st the hospital a nursing secretary and I had a thing going on for a month or two. Got oral pretty much every day after work for a while. Was a good few months until she went back with her ex. No real relationship and no drama. 10/10.

"I was raped by my ex. I tried to take it up with our university, but my RA wouldn't hear it. He just said ""Well, how did you not enjoy it?"". I tried to talk to my (former) friends about it, and they kept making fun of me for not wanting sex 24/7, and for ""letting myself get overpowered"". I finally broke it off with all of them. 

The only ones who actually validated my experience were the feminists on campus. You know, the people Reddit loves to hate? Yeah, they were the only ones who gave a shit. They were the only ones who believed me. They were the only ones to tell me that I was justified in calling it rape, and that I wasn't overreacting. They were the only ones who cared that I didn't consent, and that I shouldn't be expected to want sex 24/7 just because ""I'm a Man"". They were the only ones who supported me through it.

Imagine that, people who deal with all kinds of sexual harassment/assault all the time, being the ones who are most likely to empathize with victims of sexual violence. "
As someone who cried at work yesterday for reasons completely unrelated to work-- I'm happy I was left alone.

"I assume we're not talking about women who are upfront about their feelings - so the bar eye flicker, staring, etc, these things are all out the window.

I can never tell.  Ever.  The difference between a girl having a crush on me and a girl being friendly with me is literally nothing.  

You want to spend more time with me? Oh that's cool, I love hanging with friends.  
You want to talk to me?  Awesome, I love talking to people about interesting things.  
You want to do stuff together?  Sweet, I love doing stuff.  Who else is going?

*Lawyer now.* You do NOT want this shit to go spiraling out of control. You do NOT want to let her get ahead of you on this.

**New checking account NOW** Make the account at the same bank. Absolutely do not make it a joint checking account. Make it only so that you can access this. I can't stress this enough. Make it under your name only. Make it only accessible by you. Banks tend to be ""helpful"" and link these things. Then you should be able to transfer that money over the same day the account is created.  
When shit hits the fan, your account is probably going to be locked out. Get your money out right now.

You might have some feelings about screwing her over with this checking account. You might feel weird. These feelings are completely normal, but you *have to push through* this way of thinking. Do not give in to that line of thinking. This girl fucked another dude, without protection (that puts you at risk for his STDs btw), told you his baby was yours, and has been lying to you about this. What else has she been lying about? I bet she had an abortion, and told you the baby had issues. 

EDIT. She did have an abortion. After three months of pregnancy, it would just have a very bad period had there been issues with the baby. 

*Keep it on the down low with her*. Do not give her any information about breaking up. Just give her some BS that you want to make things work or something. Throw in some BS that you're going to schedule some couples counseling. This will buy you time, and make her think she can still fool you for a while. 

You both live in the same place, she can't stay at that guys house. So you're both stuck with each other for a bit. *Keep it cool*. Figure out where you can safely store your valued personal belongings. Move your financial paperwork to a new place as well. You do not want to expose any of this to her more than you already have. Once you have that money moved over to the new account, you're going to be in a far better situation. She's going to try to take the money you have, and do the same exact thing to you. You absolutely have to do this ASAP.

I wouldn't do any googling from your house about this. Clearing your cache is only one of the ways to hide browser history. Your router keeps you history, as well as some other things. Set a password on your phone. 

Once you have the money in the new account, call and verify that it's not a joint account. There is major cya things you need to do. 

Document everything. Whether you have evidence for it or not. When you're in court 6 months from now, you do not want to be struggling explaining the timeline, and what things were said/done. She's a lying, cheating, angry person. She is going to do everything she can to lash out, and hurt you. You need to be ready for that.

The lawyer most likely will have far better advice. "

"&gt; has anyone gotten a direct response?

Sure! I once had a girl who was giving me mixed signals like that (seemed like she liked me, but couldn't quite manage schedule a date). So I just told her straight up that I was into her and wanted to go out on a date with her and asked if she was also interested. 

She wasn't."
"She's pretty. She's nice to me. She's the only one that's nice to me. Others might be polite, or even bordering on friendly, but this girl is the only one who actually seems to give a damn what I'm feeling or thinking.

"It's funny, but I really regret helping her achieve her dream. It fundamentally changed her. 

When I met her, she was working high up in a national insurance company's finance team, making enough bank to buy her own home and have funds left over for hobbies. But it was soulless, and crushed her spirit. She would come home every day in a foul mood, having put up with idiots and vapid cubicle fillers.

Her dream was to give that up and become an educator  in a community college, where she could focus on first-gen students from risk families (poverty, race, unwed mothers, etc). I make enough bank where she didn't have to work, so I was like, ""fuck it why not?"" ... to me it's less important that she contribute 50% of the money to our life, as long as she's contributing something. 

So it was a long journey, but eventually she put her masters in mathematics to use. We had the long summer of anticipation between her hire date and her first day of class. Her spirits were sky-high, and I was thrilled for her. 

Almost within her first week, though ... her mindset began to change. Academics are bitter, foul-hearted assholes. Deep down inside, there's something wrong with them. They can't enjoy life,  Maybe it was always within her, and they brought it out. Maybe they just polluted her? 

She would come home and vent for two hours. How stupid her students were. How moronic the faculty was. How idiotic the administration was. How she was wasting her time for students who were clearly worthless, wasted beings. I tried to steer the conversation towards happy topics. Vacations we had planned, fun things to do, all that. But she would always just ignore me and go back to venting. 

Her face would make an evil scowl. She wouldn't ask me about my day. Wouldn't even ask! She would talk at me for two hours, chug a few glasses of wine, then put her face in grading the homework, muttering the whole time, ""Fail. Idiot. Drop out. Fuck you. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.""

At one point I did an experiment. I made dinner for a week. A good dinner. Home made soup, or handmade pasta and red sauce, candle on the table. All that. For five days, I didn't say a word at dinner. 

She didn't even notice. "
"Try not to make eye contact or get involved.

Whenever I get one of these drawings, I put it in my wallet and just have to take it with me everywhere. When I get a new note, I have to put the old one into a box for safekeeping, because I just can't bring myself to throw these notes away. Feels like throwing her feelings into the trash. Can't.

So now we have two shoe boxes of fading post-it notes in the bedroom wardrobe.

"From my perspective: As a rule of thumb, don't get involved with people in your hierarchy line (your superiors and subordinates) -- if HR finds out you're screwed. Also, don't get involved with accounting if you have a major personal interest in the numbers -- if business finds out you're screwed. Also, don't get involved with legal if you're involved in any legal matters -- legal will eat your ass. And for the love of god, don't ever touch the CEOs daughters -- he'll fuck you with a rake. Everything else is pretty much accepted as long as you don't make a fuss and it doesn't hurt the company. "

"Okay, first let's take out the stupid ""I'm super hot and muscular"" feeling after working out for just 2 weeks in a row because that's just your brain fucking with you through dopamine. Don't count that.

Guys **NEVER** receive the amount of attention girls do, I mean average guys, I'm sure if you are Ryan Reynolds or Ryan Gosling you might feel that all the time but average-looking /u/FrozenRyan wins if this happen once a ~~year~~ decade. I have a good-looking sister and while she easily gets 300 likes for posting a picture of her new make-up style, I'll be happy if my new profile pic gets 30 likes being 25 from my family.

The latter feeling(nobody wants me) is almost an everyday thing because this is life, whatever but when the former feeling happens, oh you have to record it, it's like finding a shiny pokémon and that's why I have a folder on my PC where I printed all the messages I got in a span of three days from six different girls openly initiating conversation with me, inviting me to a movie, to lunch, to dinner, netflix, some of them escalated to relationship, make out etc... By the way that's not from Tinder since I never used it. And what seems like an average day for a pretty girl is once in a lifetime thing for a guy, this folder will fuel me forever whenever I feel down.

It makes me sad really because some good dudes will go through life never receiving this kinda of attention and I feel like I won the lottery for ever accessing this part of my brain I never knew existed, the sentiment of being wanted can really push you forward. So yeah enjoy every little second if you ever feel it.

"Friend of mine went on a vacation with her husband of 3 years, a few years ago.  They booked a private cruse around the gulf for the evening, fancy dinner, all that stuff.  So after the dinner, in the middle of the ocean, after they finished a slow dance, he just blurts out ""I don't love you anymore.  I want a divorce.""  And pulled a packet out with the divorce papers he had gotten some lawyer to draft up.  She said the real shock was looking at them and seeing that he had already signed them.  Fun boat ride back I'm sure. "

So you have to sit a certain way, order a certain combination of things, maybe act like you really don't want that menu item at all so the server opens up to bringing it. You see other people stroll into the restaurant and just get that item by asking for it and wonder what you're doing wrong. You see movies where characters order and eat the menu item as if it's the standard for anyone that age and feel like there's something wrong with you.

"Well, she's my wife.  She's pretty fucking awesome, inside and out."
"Know how she takes her coffee or tea, and make it for her in the morning.  

Tell her she looks nice, even when she looks like a truck after she wakes up in the morning.

Schedule a time when its just the two of you.  And hold yourselves to it.

Take one day a week, and go out of your way to do something beyond your responsibilities or chores (IE - Also vacuum the living room one day) 

Buy her flowers every couple of months.  Not for a specific reason, just do it.

Explore her interests with her?  She likes books?  Go to an old book store together.

Find a hobby that you both enjoy, and then spend a weekend doing it.  My wife an I do brewery tours.

Find a tradition, and expand on it.  We also have a pair of glasses from every brewery.

Learn to cook.  It's not as hard as you think, and she will appreciate coming home to a meal.  

To touch on above, at first the meal may not taste so good, but she will be happier that you're trying and learning than anything.  Trust me, I speak from experience.

Listen.  Just fucking listen.

Tell her when you're frustrated with something, let her support you sometimes.  I tell my wife (Yes, the phrasing is intentional for both of us, because we are 12) ""I'm going to spew now"" - and just word vomit.  Exposure is scary, but brings you closer together.   

Laugh at the farting noises during sex.

Find new experiences together - go to a painting and wine night, try a co-op cooking class, go to a high elevation ropes course.

Be silly, make funny faces.

Leave notes around the house for her to find, just little subtle reminders.

Let her fail.  She has to know you're there for her, but that she can still grow and take care of herself.  But comfort her when she does.

Let her comfort you when YOU fail.  Helping others is a powerful emotion.

Advocate together.  Find something that is important to the both of you, and volunteer together.

Know that her mother will never change.  Just keep your mouth shut in most cases and deal with it.

Hang out with her dad, bonus points if he's super cool and you share interests.  (Thank god for baseball)

Take a vacation every year together.  Even if its a stay-cation.  Close the doors, turn off your phones, drink some wine, and just enjoy being close.

Read together, or listen to Audible.  Find the comfy spot, cuddle up, and even if its two different books, just enjoy being close and nearby the other.

Remind her of the amazing days you've had with gestures, ask her to dance to the wedding song while spinning around the kitchen.  Or go to the places you proposed and make new and MORE memories with great spaces.

Incorporate her friends.  Ask all of them to supper.  Listen to them and their interests.  It's about her and them tonight.  She will reciprocate.  

Have separate hobbies too, and encourage her to experience them.  Do the same for yourself.  You have to be apart once in a while.

Visit her at work for a lunch date, ""Just because"" - even if its PB&amp;J sandwiches you made at work yourself.

Make the bed every morning, even if you're late.  That two minutes that day is far less important than what that will do for her every day when she comes home and sees you have done that.

Scratch her back.  When you're watching TV, pop her bra strap, and simply scratch her back.  Nothing more, just that itchy feeling is terrible.  Bonus points if she has long hair.

Don't always defer to her.  Make decisions, stand up for yourself, but know that its important to be open and compromise.

Don't ever, EVER yell at her.  We're big and scary.  Take two deep breaths, tell her you need to do so, and say that you're taking a moment.  

And lastly, and perhaps most important:
Touch her.  When you walk past, run your hand across her back.  Pinch her butt when she's looking in the fridge.  Run your hand up and down her back when she lays her head on your chest.  Run your hand down her arm when you get out of bed.  Kiss her forehead when you walk by.  Spoon her right as you climb into bed, then hold her hand.  Rest your hand on her leg when you're watching tv.  Run your fingers through her hair.  Do all of these things. 

And I almost forgot:  The last thing she should hear you say before you leave, before she leaves, before you fall asleep, as you hang up the phone, even after a fight, or before she goes to bed while you're playing Super Mario Maker, should always be: ""I love you.""

Let that be the last thing she hears always.  So in case anything terrible ever happened, she can hold your love and those words in her heart."

Well, second date is a bit early for me to hit the sack with someone, as I prefer a bit of a deeper connection first; but generally, asking for an STI test before moving on to sex [especially without a condom] would make me think of her as a very responsible, grown-up person.

A couple years later we got engaged. A few months after that, we broke up. Now I have to see her come in with hickeys from an ex coworker who used to be my friend.

0/10 would not recommend.

Also in terms of the actual working together *while* in a relationship, I often found that we were used to bickering about things jokingly a lot but it got kind of weird while working. She would often set unrealistic standards for me while we were working, she would get mad at me if I ever tried to explain something or teach her something, and overall it just was terrible and working together really added quite a bit of stress where there shouldn't have been any."
Talk to her. Make both a possibility. 
"Yes you can, just ask them."
We are talking about superheroes here and you post some random dude with glasses? What is wrong with you?
"I have a crush, well I actually think I am in love with her.  She doesn't feel that way about me though, we are still amazing friends.  
I have a crush on her because she is amazing and funny, we love the same music, same movies, both love the same activities, she is smart, sexy, and I can't even handle it.  Silence together never feels weird, we tell each other every thing, and she is the nicest most big hearted person I know. 

Alright, I will stop my gushing now.

Edit: More gushing
So for more gushing I should say that I initially fell for her almost 3 years ago and I should have gotten my feelings out to her sooner.  I took me two years to build up the courage to do so ( and much coaxing from my friends and family), but when I finally told her she said she was kind of involved with some one.  I never really got a real answer yes or no.  However I would not change any of it, well maybe the part where she said no.  We have had great times together on many adventures, my desire to be with her pushed me to do so many new things and drove me to be a better person.  

I love the little things she does like send random texts to check up on me (my anxiety can be killer some times), or sending random corny memes some times that are too perfect.  I truly can not put into words how amazing she is, the closest I can come is to say that she is my sugar magnolia.  That song is about as close to how I feel about her as possible.  

Edit: Thank you for all the love!

"Wouldn't generalize so harshly but agree with you in this situation.

Mistakes can happen but this amount of lying and cheating certainly goes way beyond anything that could be forgiven.

Edit for clarity:

1. I am not defending the OP's ex or the act of cheating in any way. Her behaviour is despicable and being cheated on is something I wouldn't wish on anyone because on top of the obvious betrayal of trust it also hurts right in the self-esteem that your SO prefers/preferred someone else to you. I am just warning against sweeping generalizations vs. crossing that bridge once you reach it.
2. Mistakes and accidents aren't the same thing. Accidents happen - as the name suggests - by accident. You don't plan on falling down the stairs or burning your tongue on the hot tea, it just happens. By accident. Mistakes can be a conscious choice that you later regret. Such as drunkenly cheating on your SO, buying a Nickelback album or getting a tattoo on your sphincter. Your condition when you made that choice is no excuse but can be a mitigating factor."

"The higher drive partner almost always ends up having to settle for the lower drive partner's schedule. You can't create an urgency for sex when there isn't one. Asking the low libido partner to have more sex than they want it just going to turn into awkward, half-assed sex on their part; they're going to just go through the motions while you try to get your rocks off and it's going to get old quickly when it's apparent she's not into it. 

Which sucks. But that's the way it goes.  You can tell her till the cows come home how unsatisfied you are but all it will do is make her feel worse and even less interested in sex than she was before. You can turn to masturbation. And you'll have to have an honest talk with yourself about whether or not this is a feasible situation for the next one year, five years, ten years, etc. Its very unlikely to change. "
My looks aren't holding me back so much as my crippling insecurities and self-loathing.
"Well coming from a conservative background, and not having experienced girls- when I was in college there was this couple in the dorms that would often fuck each other, the thing is that the girl moaned a little when he was pounding her ass, not like a porn star but sweet little moans that actually made my dick hard, was actually annoyed by it. One time late at night she woke me up being over loud then usual, she wasn't the loudest but maybe I'm too horny because I never had some. Long story short I totally jerked off while listening to her.  
Next day when she started moaning again I shout the window so loud that it will be obvious to them every one on that side of the building could hear them fucking, never heard them fucking again after that.  
But I was always wondering is it normal for a guy to be turned on like I was? Or is it just because of my inexperience? Seriously guys I want to know."

"Please accept my heartfelt sympathies for the loss of your baby.  You and your wife have gone through something no parent should have to endure.  I also lost a child, so I'm familiar with the pain your'e experiencing.  You two should find a grief counselor to help you through this.  Do so immediately.  You may need individual counseling as well as couples counseling.  I found that my husband grieved in a much different way than I did, so don't expect your wife to grieve the same way or for the same amount of time as you. We grieved together and helped each other through the hard times; he was my support through it all.  You move on by taking it day by day, and if that is too hard then you take it hour by hour or minute by minute.  Force yourself to get out of bed and shower each day. Eat three meals and go for a short walk.  Go back to work.  You'll go through the motions of life feeling numb because of your loss, but eventually some feeling will come back.....a little more each day.  What was your baby's name?  I found that I talked about my Matthew a lot, as it kept him alive in my mind.  Your friends will be well-meaning, but might disappear or do/say weird things.  Don't hold it against them, as they just don't know how to react or support you through this.  Find comfort, peace and solace in your wife.  Celebrate together the life you created in your child and the short time you spent with your baby.  Eventually, the pain will decrease to where you can function normally again.  The pain of losing your child will never leave, but it takes it's place in the history of your marriage and allows you to move forward together.  Take it a step at a time and eventually you'll get there.  "

This is probably the most underrated piece of advice. Personally (if my lawyer said it was safe to do as, and I wouldn't lose any rights because of it) I would ask to sleep on a mates couch.

Not only for your safety, but for your physical and mental well-being.

Hopefully your lawyer will inform you of your rights regarding the house.

If you are the only one with money, you need to make sure you aren't screwed over financially for this.

But yeah, take every precaution you can and stay strong."

"I'll tell a good story.

There was a girl in my Algorithms class in Uni.  She seemed smart, and my company was hiring co-ops/interns.  I ask her if she's looking for a co-op and ask for her resume.  Fast forward a bit, I'm talking to her more, and walking her through some of the technical things for the job she's applying for.  

At this point, I start getting the impression she's flirting with me.  Rewind, I have a long time girlfriend (now my fiancee).  So i'm a little worried I overstepped somewhere and gave her the wrong impression.  I'm talking with my GF about it, and I let her know whats up.  I just keep playing it cool, keeping it all business etc.  

Fast forward, she's working for my company and we're hanging at work.  At some point we start talking about relationships and stuff.  She tells me when I was trying to hire her, every single one of her friends was convinced I was ""just trying to pick her up"".  I tell her that's funny, because I was convinced she was flirting with me / had a crush on me during the time I was trying to recruit her.  We have a laugh about it.  

Later she comes over to chill and watch Game of Thrones w/ me and my fiancee.  She leaves, fiancee looks at me and says ""Uh... I totally understand why you thought she was crushing on you.  Her body language was all over the place"".  

And this is why I never assume women have crushes on me."
"It was her birthday and I'd spent my whole month's pay on Space Jam merch for her, only for her to say that not only was Babe the smash hit kids film of 1996, not Space Jam, but that Michael Jordan is a poor man's Andrew Gaze. I couldn't even bring myself to tell her that Babe came out in 1995 because I just felt nothing for her after that, she wasn't worth the effort."

"I was very popular in secondary school (UK, 11-16) until another popular kid and a group of 20 of his mates decided to beat me up for no reason other than to knock me down a peg.

It was in the town centre and completely humiliated me. At the time MySpace was all the rage, and for the next month they posted cryptic shit about it every day and laughed amongst themselves.

It changed me completely, and I eventually came to terms with the fact it was for the better.

I stopped being cocky, realised I might have upset others with how I acted, and made a new set of much nicer, calmer, happier friends who weren't pushing to be popular constantly like my old group.

It hurt a lot, knocked my confidence, and took years to fully recover from. I joined a gym, became happier and closer to my family, and just rode out the storm."

"I was visiting my home town and a friend through a party for me. I get a couple of drinks in me but I am still very aware of what is going on. I am talking to this girl and I'll admit there was a sexual spark between us. However, I did not want to sleep with her. After our conversation ends I decided to talk to some more people and eventually hook up with someone else, it was safe and we both wanted it.

I just got laid and the party is still going so no reason to stop. The girl I was talking to earlier comes up to me again, starts handing me drink after drink. I think she is matching me and we are having fun... she was drinking water. I realize had just drunk far too much, i call it quits and head up to the bedroom. I know I am about to be black out drunk and I really don't like being active in that state. I made sure no one else was in the bed at the time and hit the bed. 

I can't be completely sure as to how this happened but as I woke up I realize that someone is on top of me. In the current drunk and lazy haze I do not have the constitution to get them off me. I said 'What the fuck are you doing?' They said 'Having fun'. I cannot move at this point. I just sort of lay there and drift in and out. 

When i first woke up, I was convinced it was a dream. Like 'ahh well fuck it, it wasn't a bad dream'. Then i realize someone else is in the bed with me. Followed by the realization that I am missing entire bottom wardobe. In that weird state between hangover and drunk I didn't quite conmect the dots. We both get up, and she states that she's hungry. I check the fridge see that it empty and suggest we go to DD. We hope in my friends cars and have a pleasant ride. 

We get our food, sit down, and at this point I'm mostly sobered up. As we are talking, last night starts coming back to me. Then the realization hits me like a brick; I'm basically on a date with the person who fucked me in my sleep last night, and who I made an active decision to not sleep with. I get silent for the rest of our time together. As we leave DD, an old friend of mine is at the register and I ask what he knows about the girl I was with. He replies, 'I don't know her personally, but she's apart of the turbo-hoe group'. Fuck me, right?

So let's recap; I some drinks. Flirted with girl A, but decided to not sleep with her. Had sex with some one else that night. Got completely blitzed. Went to sleep by myself. Woke up in an incapacitated state with girl A on top of me 'having fun'. Went to sleep. Woke up again, with girl A next to me while i was partially disrobed. 

I don't want to call it 'rape' because while I feel what she did was wrong, I have various reason to not hold it on the same level as to what I consider rape. For example the worst part is I was worried about my body; i didn't know if this girl was clean, and I highly doubt she wrapped me up. I regularly get tested for STDs because I am sexually active. Then I started worrying if there was any contraception at all. I spent nearly the next year in fear that I am going to get a call explaining that I have a kid, and that would have just ruined my life at that time. 

I came out clean, and still haven't received any calls about estranged children. So aside from giving me exetremely uncommon positions on female on male rape, and a lesson about drinking responsibly, no ramifications. "

"You won't like this answer, but it's the truth.

You don't go back to ""being yourself"". Shit like this changes you. It changes your brain.

The only option is to move on. To accept it as a part of you, albeit a part that you might not want. You can limit how it affects you, but you have to live with it.

If your *identity* is in being 100% mentally healthy all the time, when you do have an episode or your behavior is obviously altered by the condition, suddenly your *identity* is false. Who you are is no longer who you *identify* as. 

The condition has to become part of your *identity*, one way or another. That *identity* can and should be that **you are more** than your condition."

Then follow the solid advice from others - get a lawyer, secure your money, secure your possessions, document everything that happens, don't be alone with her.

Connected with Step 1., don't seek revenge.  Don't take, or damage, any of her stuff, or anything that might even be considered joint without the lawyer's ok.  Your best revenge, should you want such, is for this to be the beginning of a new, and better chapter in your life.

Well after a few months of this happening, I decided that it may be worth reciprocating. So I asked if she wanted to hang out on the weekend. She responds with an excited ""Yes!"" and.... gives me a fake number.

"I'm sorry to hear this man. Ive been cheated on too so I know how much that sucks. 

Well, first thing is first, the relationship is over. You are no longer planning a future with this woman and she is not your responsibility at all anymore. Everything you do going forward should be treated as such. **Until you figure the following things out, do not tell her that you know what's been going on:**

* As far as how to handle the jointly owned condo, I'm not sure how that works. I'd meet with a lawyer and figure that out. It's ""jointly owned"" so did you each pay for 50% of it's value? If so, I'd guess one of you has to buy the other person out, and if neither one of you wants to do it, you put it up for sale and split the profit.

* As far as any other bills etc. You two might share, take yourself off of them. Also, change any passwords to important things you might have that she is aware of such as bank accounts. Better yet, change them all. If she is an authorized user on your credit cards, take her off. 

Once you do those things (figure out condo situation, get yourself financially protected), take her out somewhere public like a coffeehouse and lay it all out. You know what's been going on, you know what happened, it's over, ""get the fuck out of my condo"". Every time she wants to meet and talk, meet in public. Do not give her the opportunity to file a fake assault charge on you. It's not common but it happens. If she was ready to fuck you over for 18 years, she will fuck you over to save face. Don't let your life get ruined over her crying on the phone begging you to meet up at home.

The reason I'm suggesting these things is because it is already established that she has no respect for you and doesn't care about you. Therefore, when you blow her life up by telling her to move out (or you yourself move out), she could try to really fuck you over. Keep in mind she just almost gave birth to a child that wasn't yours. Do you really think she'd step up to the plate and let you off the hook?  No. She would have had you on the hook for 18 years minimum and she wouldn't tell you shit."

When shit hits the fan, which is may have already, you are the one paying the mortgage. It's really that simple. You can't trust her to pay it. You can't trust her for anything."

"There was a post by /u/MildlyEverything I found insightful. 

Her post:

&gt;***""Does anyone else consciously try to be the ""chill"" girlfriend?""***

&gt; I used to do this, then I realised it was one of the key reasons my past relationships failed. I was setting expectations at the beginning of the relationship that were unfair on me and the guy. I'd also keep them up way past the initial couple of weeks - and that's when the real potential for fuck-upness occurs.
&gt; 
&gt; Essentially, I'd create a Fake Me, who I felt was much more loveable (and who doesn't want to be loved?). 

&gt;**Fake Me**:
&gt; 
&gt;* Hardly needs any attention at all
&gt;* Often compromises without the guy even knowing a compromise had taken place
&gt;* Spends hours and hours waiting, and is usually always available at a seconds notice
&gt; * Doesn't have any needs and wants, at least, not ones that are important enought to get communicated
&gt;* Is practically a saint
&gt;* Doesn't actually exist
&gt; 
&gt;On the other hand, **Real Me**:
&gt; 
&gt;* Only feels secure and happy when I have enough attention to know I'm valued
&gt;* Is not always willing to compromise, but when I do, I damn well want that acknowledging or resentment will ensue
&gt;* Has better things to do then spend hours waiting, is not always available at a seconds notice, and gets really pissed off at being blown off or ignored
&gt;* Does have needs and wants that do matter
&gt;* Is not a saint
&gt;* Does actually exist
&gt; 
&gt; In one case, Fake Me persisted for months, and then Real Me snapped and ended the relationship. Poor guy had no clue what the problem was or where all my resentment was coming from. I'd been so eager to be loved and accepted that I hadn't let him meet Real Me, so the relationship never really had a chance.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I'm trying not to let Fake Me exist. My thinking: Why the hell am I putting so much effort in to get a guy (or anyone, for that matter) to like someone who doesn't exist? Wouldn't it just be better if I gave them a shot at meeting and maybe liking the person I actually am?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not saying don't be considerate, I'm not saying don't be chill, I'm not saying don't put your best foot forward, and I'm definitely not saying don't try to be a great person: I'm saying don't do these things to the extent it hurts you, your partner and the relationship.

Okay, so the first step is to make yourself physically unattractive. It's a bit easier for us guys who are blessed with poor looks, but I think you can manage if you really put some effort into it. Once you've got that hammered down, at least you will no longer have to beat women off with a stick every time you leave the house. That should help immensely.

Next thing I would recommend is to adopt some sort of mental disorder. Something based in anxiety would be ideal, and there are enough out there that you can really have fun with it. I went with ARFID, myself. At any rate, this will make it so that any woman who gets desperate enough to talk to you will instantly be disgusted by your presence.

Hope this helps."
"Basketball. I could go on for hours about why - I honestly think there are objective qualities to the game that make it superior to many other sports. Here are some of them:

You can play with any number of people. There's so much you can do just dribbling or shooting around on your own. Then there are so many games within the game for more players, from 1 on 1 to knock out to full 5 on 5. 

Every position has the same rules, yet they've organically developed dramatically different roles and skill sets. Allen Iverson and Shaquille O'Neal have both led the league in scoring. 

There's a great combination of individual greatness and team play, often working in tandem. Basketball is a team game, and no player has ever won the championship without having a great team around him. At the same time, the best players are able to take over for moments or even entire games to send their teams over the top to victory.

The aesthetic quality. Ankle-breaking dribbles, sexy jumpers, flurries of passes, high flying dunks, earth-shattering blocks - incredible, superhuman things are constantly happening.

Man, I could talk about this all day.

But, and this is a big, smelly but, shitting great swollen asterisks: 

Even though you know she's outputting attraction signalling, you have no idea whether she's actually attracted and not: doing it for attention; doing it to win a favor from you; prepared to change her mind on the spot; just acting that way toward all guys for some reason; trying to 'defeat' the other woman in the room; in rare cases unaware she's actually doing it because socially inept; etc. "

That said, there's some good people on there. It just takes a while to sift through them. An important bit of advice: don't waste too much time messaging/texting before you meet. Talk for a bit, ask  her out within the week and go meet in person. You might have great text chemistry but end up hating each other, or suck at texting and like each other."
"People who will literally stop their vehicle, forcing all traffic behind them to also stop, just so they can make a lane change.

Heaven forbid they have to travel one extra block then turnaround. No no, better to just inconvenience everyone else because their convenience is the most important."
The hell?
"When I realized I didn't have it in me to have the same fight anymore. He knew he was in the wrong, so he said ""break up"" trying to change the dynamics/get me off his back. Instead, I felt relieved and said ""okay"". "

"You begin to masturbate vigorously every time you are near her. I'm not judging, just observing."
"I like to have conversations about complex social issues, and unfortunately about all of my friends are the type of liberal that cant have these conversations, they just repeat  talking points/current pop-wisdom nonsensical jargon which doesnt have any scientific backing and then shout 'racist/sexist' when I point that out, so I have to read, listen to podcasts and have those discussions in my head."
"&gt;she's beautiful and friendly person 
 
ok
&gt;you don't have many business interactions with her

The first part coupled with this makes me think you need to leave her alone."
You better tell her before she gets it in her head that you like them and makes them all the time.
" &gt;""turn a 2 into a 10"" (spoiler alert: lol, fuck no)

Yeah, although the inverse is certainly possible."
"Just the other day a girl that I don't know that well told me, 

""You're so much cooler in person then on your social media accounts!""

She was drunk so she was being 100% truthful is my guess. She then continued to ramble about how I have this interesting life that no one ever see's. Felt pretty cool for some reason but at the same time annoyed me because I'm being judged off of some stupid bullshit that I rarely post stuff to.

Oh for fucks sake
"Yes. [There has been at least one case of a woman having sex with an underage boy \(aka rape\) and when he was 18 he had to pay child support.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/09/03/child-support-statutory-rape-justice-law-men-column/15044791/)

If you complain about it you'll hear a load of shit about ""what's best for the child"" apparently what's best for the child is for a rapist to raise them."
I bought the same deodorant he uses and wear it to bed sometimes since we don't live together. (We've been dating for almost 8 years 😊) 
Sounds like a challenge.
"I've been using OkCupid on and off for 9 years now, and Tinder on and off for 2 years now. The biggest lesson I've learned is that the women I've met have not looked as good as their profile pictures. "
"On the other hand, if I were unable to blame my match rate on photography I'm not entirely sure my ego would survive."
"She was wedging away friends and family, spending all the money, quit working, kept demanding.

It dawned on me that I was nothing but an attendant to her and that there was no helping someone like that. I went to my family and then to an attorney. "

"Fire departments in the USA are predominantly volunteer.  Better than 70% of the country, actually.  Canada, Americas Hat, has to be pretty similar.   
Altruism is on the decline, country wide.  Fire fighting, EMS, and many other volunteer organizations are struggling to recruit and retain new members.  There may come a time in my town where dialing 911 does not get a local response....so many towns all over are in the same boat.  Its fucking sad! 
Consider checking out your local fire department.  If you really wanted in they will likely welcome you and show you the way.    
If its something you want to do, you will make the time, get trained, drive fire trucks, tame strange and kick fires ass.  

Also..
Co-ed naked firefighting.....find them hot, leave em wet.  "

"I'd still be walking funny from the whippin' I'd have gotten from my dad. You need to get to the bottom of why he did this though, especially if this is out of character for him. To me this level of violation of another persons property needs a massive correction so it doesn't become a habitual thing.

*Not a father"
I feel like you need to talk to your so about this. For their own good.

"Heh! I like that one. For me, I'd bet 99% of the time I'm not even aware that I'm looking at someone. I juts happen to be facing that direction. "
That entire statement just reaffirms that you have a mental health issue holy shit.

"As someone who is paying $800/month even though he earns $34k, that sounds like a bargain."
"When it interferes with your quality of life instead of being a passing annoyance, it's time to get help. "
"I'd whip out my biweekly updated wallet sized test results. 

If you'd be asking a guy about his latest STI results/ask if he could get one done, the implication is that you probably wanna get in his pants A$AP. There might be an initial ""..ooookay"" reaction, but I'd be down. "
That could explain the divorce...
"Psychology - most mood/personality disorders are a product of civilization and lifestyle and become giant excuses. They are over-diagnosed and can definitely be overcome through hard work by the patient. But hey, I'll take some amphetamines and benzodiazepines any day! "
What would you know about being a superhero? You're just some lousy reporter for that liberal propaganda rag.
"Depends on the job.

I've hooked up with a few coworkers but it was a relatively low level job in a predominately female industry.

Once I moved to management I cut that shit out. "
"Don't play mind games. Say what you mean, and mean what you say. 

Tbh that's advice for anyone ever. "
"I feel like I would never fall in love with someone else if I was married. Falling in love takes some level of emotional vacancy that I would not have because married. But if somehow magically this did happen regardless, I would be more concerned with why I was searching for love in other people when I'm married? Makes no sense. "
