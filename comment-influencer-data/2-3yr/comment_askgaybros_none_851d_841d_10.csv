"It's not that I don't want to be associated to gay culture I just quite frankly don't entirely feel like I belong in that community. Don't get me wrong I've tried joining the tribe but I never felt totally accepted. 

I'm not quite fem but I'm not quite masc. I'm not that sexual and even when I am I'm rarely dtf. I'm not a fan of clubbing every weekend, or a fan of club drugs, I just like my weed. Not everything is a political issue for me. I'm not a fan of pride or flags(both national or sexuality flags). Oh and I hate having to defend using condoms every rare instance I have sex. Like guys it's not a challenge jeez. And no I don't care if you're on prep and it's not like we can get pregnant. 


Also the community is so cliquey that it hurts. Every group thinks they're better than the other. Half don't believe bi guys exist. People get offended if you're not interested and start claiming it's about their age, race, type (fem or masc), etc. When in actuality I just don't find you attractive, am here with my friends, or I know I won't go home with you tonight but that's what you're looking for and I'm just trying to not waste your time. 

Oh and if you go to a club that has a drag queen and you have resting bitch face and your arms crossed absent-mindedly they will call you out on it. And there will likely be a best ass competition. 

I could go on and make a list of what bothers me. But that's not the point. The gay community just isn't my tribe, I fit better with the nerds, that's where I feel I belong. 

I can be myself with them. With the gay community I feel like you need to be either a skinny, flirty, white twink, or a 'straight acting' ex jock. And you must want to bang someone at least once a week.

If you like it, great be a part of it. But don't hate on the guys who don't want to be a part of your tribe. If you really wanted all gay guys to be a part of gay culture, well, it's time to be more inclusive. To stop the in fighting in the community. To understand not every gay person is the same. To not be such ... bullies. There I said it. Some of y'all feel like bullies that after they shit on you 'don't get why you don't like us or want to be one of us'.

 I might get flack for this but please remember this is just my experience and that of a few friends. I get not all LGBT people do this, just like not all men harass women. 

Edit: tl;dr: Don't assume everyone has a good experience with gay culture and people are welcome to join diffrent tribes if that's the case. Just find where you feel you belong not where everyone tells you you belong. 

Edit 2: I never thought I'd make this kind of edit but Holy cow thanks for the gold! That's awesome I feel so fancy now 😀 I'm glad so many people could relate to this, but it's also disheartening that this is the case for so many, the community should be a place of acceptance and encouragement and not what it is right now. But thank you again, seriously, it made my week! "
The confusion that comes from not knowing if you're attracted to a guy or if you want to look like the guy. 
"I love my dick!! 

As a matter of fact, I'm quite attached to it"
Cuddling with a guy and feeling him slowly get hard against you. 
I just want you to know that you're not the only person like this. Your entire post is 100% applicable to my experience with the community.

"While it sucks, I wouldn't let it weigh heavily on myself. This guy invited you to one of his concerts. You went. All you did was answer the question from the person next to you. His parents happened to hear.

Unfortunately going out with guys who are in the closer makes things very difficult. Don't blame yourself. Just move on from the situation, especially since you aren't seeing him seriously anymore."
"My experience with people who do not want to be associated with gay culture, are more masculine gays who do not like stereotypes of the traditional gay man, you know the snapping rolling the neck gay man who wears makeup and is obsessed with Cher. They are allowed to feel that way,because there is no one way to be gay. I just do not like when some of these people like to clown and shame feminine gay men,cause at the end of the day they are being themselves just like you are being yourself. "
"If their reaction is potentially as bad as you say it could be, then are these guys really even your friends? "
"I mean, if you want to take the high road (be honest, find out if he's a better person, maybe give him a chance), you might teach him a thing about what it means to be a forgiving person.  But you also don't want to teach him to take you for granted or help get a job for a homophobe who's going to embarrass you and reflect poorly on you professionally.

Tell him you'd like to meet up and talk with him about it.  Tell him you want to help, but you also can't recommend someone for a job who's going to reflect poorly on you.  Tell him that the person he was the last time you interacted with him and his family isn't the kind of person you can recommend for a job.  Meet up for coffee or something, talk about your concerns, talk about what's going on in his life, ask him if he still has a problem with gay people (cause he'd be working with at least one), and ask him what he'd do if one of *his* kids comes out to him 15 years from now.  Basically, give him a life interview before you get him a job interview.

Don't like what you hear?  Don't recommend him for the job."
You guys are so fucking thirsty.

"Honestly, I would stop talking to them. They think your relationship is inherently not equal to theirs, that your love isn't as valuable and ""moral"" as their love. That's something I wouldn't tolerate in an acquaintance, much less someone who used to be close to me. They basically think you're not an equal person to them.

Not attending your marriage is also a huge insult, possibly even worse than his ""personal beliefs"". He cant evem set aside the beliefs he picked up from this Christian girl for his brother? He was willing to convert to her anti gay belief system despite the fact his own brother is gay?

I dont think he values your relationship together very much, so why should you value it?"
"Hoo boy lemme tell ya. 

Straight guys will never understand how AWARE of our own bodies gay guys are.  We spent a good portion of time in the closet carefully choosing our mannerisms and keeping certain things in check.  

If we're in public we constantly scan the environment to make sure that it might be okay to kiss our SO.  Even if we are ""okay"" with it, then we're still just shy of being Carelessly in love.  

Gay guys can float somewhere in between Boy world and Girl world and never quite *fully* belong in either.  

Straight guys don't realize that they have the luxury of being *in touch with their emotions*, but for gay guys we're being *stereotypical*.  

In general, I think straight guys and gay guys are waaaayyy different.  I love being gay but damn it's like playing life on Hard difficulty sometimes.  I like a challenge, though. So it.works out"

"(Good Stuff)

1. Sharing a wardrobe with your SO

2. Having an SO who you can play sports with on the same team

3. The pleasure of dominating another man.

4. The pleasure of submitting to another man.

5. How comforting it is to have another man who completely relates to you and your life to hang out with and love you. (Bromance but even more so)

6. (not necessarily ""never undersatnd"", but unlikely) Having an older partner who is further along in their career than you and may be able to support -you-.


(Bad Stuff)

7. Having to debate people who demand to know why you want biological kids instead of adopting.

8. What it's like to be told you can't get married because it will devalue everyone else's marriage.

9. Hanging out with a guy friend who says he hates guys like you without realizing he's saying that.

10. Hearing people on TV claim they couldn't help but kill people like you just because they panicked due to fearing they were being hit on. (gay panic defense).

11. Realizing you can't visit some countries because they will push you off the roof.

12. Having to be really on top of your sexual health.  Get tested regularly.  Not a big deal, but its annoying hearing bigots call you plague-carriers when you're actually working much harder than they ever had to ensure you're being safe and protecting the people you love."

Well I think God made gay people to adopt the kids that straight people refuse to love. And too, if those statements he gave to you were not provoked (if you didn't ask him about it) it is really fucked up. "
"This is so funny. From the way you described it I don't think it was that intentional, he probably just has no experience or a different type of experience. Or maybe he was just really tired that night and was making the effort to have sex for you?

"Straight bros never understand how fucking difficult it is to be gay and how strong being gay and facing gay challenges make you. 

If you want to stand up to a bully, ask a gaybro...he has done it. 
If you need to negotiate family hating on you....ask a gaybro. 
Porn past haunt you at work or school....gaybro.....done it. 

Straight guys just try not to feel their feelings. So they get really pissed when they get hurt, and they don't have a mechanism for de-escalation or for mature evaluation and compromise. It really is SEE JANE RUN from an emotional perspective compared to a gaybro who has been obsessing over his own emotions around orientation since he was six. 

So...I think all gaybros should have a rainbow cape, because we are like superheros. We navigate so many complex difficult situations and often with NO MENTORS or SUPPORTERS. 

so Yeah....they don't get how fucking strong we are. They think being gay makes you weak, or a wimp.....it takes real men to face gay life. "

"When being gay is an entire gay guys personality. And everything they do is to prove some point and slander well intentioned people as homophobic. Just live your life and stop feeling the need to be the victim and have to seek validation everywhere you go. It also minimizes real homophobic acts when some gay gays get all out of shape over some very slightly offensive joke. If we want to be considered ""normal"", we need to be able to make fun of ourselves. Otherwise we kinda do seem like special, weird, abnormal snowflakes."

"I simply don't like gay guys all that much, that's essentially why.

TL;DR:  I did a friend purge and only had mostly straight friends left, after realizing I was done with cunty people.

I am not hyper masculine as a previous commenter tried to slant the discussion.  I'm not hyper feminine.  I'm just a regular gay guy.  People usually figure out I am gay.  I am not into the bitchy, mean-girl culture that almost all gay guys are into.   I'm over the shock humour that gay guys love to pull in a group of people, like one acquaintance who feels he has to talk about putting a dildo in his ass at the dinner table with a mixed group of people.  I do watch Ru Paul's Drag race, but that keeps mean spirited people at arms length, and it's funny to watch, but not fun to live.   

I used to have many gay friends and acquaintances.  My best friend and roommate was a drag queen.   He was a mean ol' cunt though.  

I moved into my own place by the time the following story happened:  One day he made one of his mean comments in front of a group of people I didn't know - his new drag family.  He used embarrassing info about a guy I brought home one night.   He did this solely so he could get a laugh from a group, at my expense - something he had taken up doing a lot since becoming a DQ.   I did the right thing and pulled him aside and explained how that shit wasn't cool with me anymore, and that I would never speak to him again if he brought up my personal life again to people as a joke.  My personal life was not to be fodder for his witty little showoff sessions.  10 minutes later he did it again.  I glared at him.  He knew he had done wrong, as his eyes went wide and then he looked away and got quiet.  I said nothing.  I just picked up my coat and walked away.  I have not spoken to him to this day, and I ignore him when I see him on the street.

When I got rid of him as a best ""friend"", I realized how nice it was not having a total cunt around me, narrating my life.  I realized he had been putting me down for years, and I was taking that shit just to fit in to a group I no longer wanted to fit into.  There might have been sexual tension.  I don't know, as I was never attracted to him in the least.  

After that, I made a pact with myself to purge all the poisonous people from my life, and realized after a couple years, that all I had left were my straight friends.  I still have a few gay friends, but I don't hang out with them much anymore.  They are more facebook friends than anything else at this point.  And now, I am just happier.  I don't go to gay bars, as I have, my hubby.  I go to Pride because my straight friends want to go.  Other than that there isn't any gay culture to me.... it's just ""culture"" and I couldn't care less if gay guys are there or not.  The clubs I go to are more like pop up events, or clubs where DJ friends are playing.  The house scene is mixed, nice, and accepting.

My straight buddies never act like mean-girls, they are so much nicer and chill to gay guys than gay guys are to other gay guys.  They crack the odd joke, and have fun with it, but I know it comes from a totally different place than the mean spirited jabs.

So that's why I checked out.

Edit:  typos."
"I'm with you on that one BUT, I would confront him about it instead. 

""Ohhhh, so you want the help of a faggot now that it's convenient for *you*? Why should I help an asshole who wasn't there for me when I needed him?"" "
Masculinity is not as fragile as it is in US. Thats why in other parts of the world justin bieber has massive male fans. Guys kiss and hold hands and wear speedos all the time too. In america all of those things are considered gay

"Because that is the sad reality of the app, I've been on it for a few years already. There are a quite a few guys on there, probably more than people here would admit, that are solely on the app for validation purposes - namely just to see how many matches they can get to feel better about themselves. They have no intention to meet anyone, or even connect with someone.

Sucks, but thats the way it is. Believe me though, you will meet a good guy on there though where you'll become at least friends if you hang around long enough ^"

Honestly, that kind of behaviour is not acceptable"

"Exactly. They think the action of enjoying their butt being played with is what makes them gay.

I have friends who refuse to believe a guy can be straight if he enjoys pegging, or any anal play for that matter. Apparently wanting stimulate your prostate and have a better orgasm makes you queer, even if you were to do it yourself with a toy.

Oh well, they're the ones missing out, not us. "

"He sounds like one of the Christians who focuses on the wrong part of the message. Too many Evangelicals focus too much on the ""sins"" other people commit and ignore the message of love and empathy for our fellow people that Jesus taught.  

Most anthropological views agree that homosexuality was called out as a violation of law in the Old Testament because the Jews at the time were a small semi-nomadic population, and anything that took away from reproduction was wrong. It has nothing to do with STDs. The only mentions of homosexuality in the New Testament are from Paul, who met Jesus one time, and viewed most things pleasurable as sinful. Most scholars of the Greek language (which is the language Paul and most other New Testament writers used) also agree that Paul was mistranslated in his writings against homosexuality and that he was actually prohibiting exploitative relations between men and younger boys, not consensual relationships between adult men.

"You're old enough to find new friends that don't try to invalidate your existence.

Stop going with the status quo because it's comfortable."
"Okay well perhaps I misspoke and used some poor examples. 

I'll start by saying I never felt 'cool' for not fitting in. I craved to be accepted somewhere I felt at home. The gay community/culture did not help fill that void of not belonging, so I sought a diffrent tribe to feel at home with. I found that eventually and now feel a lot 'cooler' then I did before. 

 Again I don't hate the community and I'm very passionate about lgbtq+ rights, I just didn't feel like I fit. I'm really really happy that it does fit people, cause everyone should feel like they belong somewhere. 

I'd say that the lgbtq+ movement is accepting and a huge advocate for safe sex, but I found the opposite to be true with my local community of Toronto and the GTA. Not to mention according to the cdc condom use in gay youth is actually down and syphilis is up by 60% I would source this but I'm on mobile and I'm more than sure y'all have access to google.

I've found in my personal sex life that condoms are now up to debate. Many guys say they're on prep, they're clean, condoms just don't feel good, they can't keep it up with a condom, hell one guy even tried to convince me to have shower sex and that you can't use a condom in the shower after I refused to go bare. I find telling a lot of guys take the condom thing as a challenge. 

 My trans and bi friends too find a lot of opposition in the community. From getting hate on dating apps for being trans to being told to just pick a side being bi. A lot of people feel the gay community is just that, a gay community. 

But it goes beyond hooking up, drugs, and condoms. It's the in fighting, the drama (like a lot of people mentioned), the lack of boundaries, hyper sexualization, to even the little things like drag, queer shows and lady Gaga. These are things I don't associate with, they're not my jam, but if their yours that's awesome. I don't hate these things they're just not for me. 

The way I look at it is the lgbtq+ movement and the community is a lot like canada and Alberta.  Canada promotes diversity and acceptance to all. But there are a lot of local communities in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada that are racist, Islamophobic, and homophobic. There's a dissonance between the values of the whole of Canada and the localized communities within it. Which I believe to be the case for the lgbtq+ movement and community. "

"I was having sex at a guys house and he wanted to do it in his parents room and I was like ""ok, weird but I'll do it."" So we were going at it cowboy style and when it finally came time to climax he was fucking me while I was jerking off and when it came time to cum I shot super far over his head and onto the wall behind him. Normally this is an issue a tissue could solve but his parents had wall paper in their bedroom and my apparently caustic semen started to make the colors run. The by the time we cleaned it up there was a foot long streak of messed up colors that was very, very noticeable. I quickly put my clothes on left. When his parent came home they though there was a leaky pipe that caused the damage so they had part of the wall torn open looking for a leaky pipe which in reality was just my dick. "

The way your friends talk about him only adds to the issues he already has and the pain he already feels.

I'd ask my friends to stop talking about him that way (well at least not in his presence), maybe incorporate him more in you all's gatherings. 

I'd also talk to him about his feelings and how he perceives himselfs as a man. Remind him he IS a man, as much as you. He doesn't necessarily want to fall into a ""heteronormative"" (hate that word lmao) type of relationship where you're the man and he's the woman. He wants to be your equal and people don't necessarily perceive him that way.

Make him your equal in front of other people too. "

"Gulp.....

Yes. 

This always makes me feel a little bad, but...Well shit...here goes. 

We started dating when I was 32, He was 24. I was his first serious relationship, he was my 3rd. He worked at night, I worked during the day, He was fem, I was masc, He was only bottom, I was verse/top, he did drag, I took pictures and fetched drinks. We had a decent life, but he did things I didn't like. He never worked full time, I made a lot more money than he did, and constantly had to work at keeping things paid. He would squander his paycheck, I had to budget hard to keep us fed, gasoline, rent et cet. He also would wait till I fell asleep and then would leave and go party. I hated that, I had limited time for bar and party, I had an early morning job and had to be on time. I got really pissed because he bought a bed and moved into another bedroom, I didn't want or need a room mate, if we weren't sleeping together I felt he didn't love me. Push came to shove and I ended it. He was devastated. He went to counseling, stalked me a little bit, came back around and slept with me several times, tried to fire it back up, but you know the issues were always there. For a long time we seemed to be always dating someone when the other was single. He would come around, I would be dating someone. I would go to a show, he had a boyfriend. I finally met someone and got married. He was so pissed/hurt he couldn't make himself attend the wedding. We eventually talked it all out over time and identified the things we each did wrong and apologized. (Not incl for time and space here, but it was a lot) We got to a really good place. We talked on the phone and he discussed a visit out to see me and my husband. It never happened. He died of a massive heart attack the year he turned 40. He was happily moving into a new place with his boyfriend, put together some furniture and died. It always feels weird to talk about it, but my husband knew him, and is always supportive. when I read he had passed on Facebook I called information and got his mother's number and called. She really appreciated it, and I was glad to have spent time with him. She told me, ""I know you were married to another guy, but he always burned a candle for you, you know that? He thought you were his love."" 

I cried a bit...but I am at a really good place with it these days. "

"I really wish gay people(particularly ones who've just come out) wouldn't feel such a strong need to conform with whatever ""being gay"" is to them. It's not that we are the same, but that so many of us try to be. I bet it's a big reason reason for gay people's lingering high mental illness rate.

And I don't mean mannerisms so much as interests ect."
"Reactions like that make me want to show even more PDA. Oops, my existence having dinner with another dude bothers you? How about if I hold his hand? Does that.... upset you? Wow you're really not going to like it when we kiss :D Sorry assholes!"
"Makes my dick happy, if that's what you're asking."
"What? You communicated with him?

You didn't even get to the part about your homophobic asian straight best friend that sucked your dick once while you were drunk and you're not sure if it was rape, but you think you may have contracted aids from it and it made your parents kick you out."
When men old enough to know better are open/vocal about their attractions to underage guys. 
"Being bi but mostly gay, it turns out that one great thing about guys is we're way more into cuddling than chicks. 

Go figure"
"Why? Because ""gay culture"" makes your sexuality the focal point of your entire personality. That's fucking stupid. My entire life does not revolve around the fact that I like dicks. I don't need to go and scream it in a parade or mention it to every single person I come across. I'm a complex person, I like a lot of different things, and I don't want to be pigeonholed. "
"Being raised in an Asian household, you taught to always remove shoes when entering a house. Your own house or your friends/relatives. 

I completely don't understand why many Americans don't?? Why would you want to track all the dirt and germs from outside into your house and carpet, where you often sit and lay on the floor etc? Also being in shoes all day is hot/constricting/uncomfortable so why do you want that while you're in the house?"
The Chechnya one has a lot of hot guys...makes me think a lot of them are fake profiles that people with bad intentions make in order to lure gay men.
Also: getting hard against another guy's bulge. Few things beat that feeling.
"&gt; he's just incredibly selfless and willing to go through with it

No, by providing him with unfettering access to your cock you are giving him precisely what he needs. It's called compatibility.

As an aside, if he is directing the action here, giving you a blow job can mean he is more dominant than you. He is using your cock for his pleasure. If he is submissive he wants you to use his mouth for your pleasure. It is not the role of a submissive to decide how to please you."
"I was very suicidal as a 20 something. I had no one to confide my feelings in. I make it a point now to help people, especially young gay people to overcome their depression and see that they have value and purpose, because they do!!!

I am so sorry for your loss bro. "
I hate that shit.  Straight guys are not into us.  Leave them alone.
Probably the anxiety that comes with a large chunk of the world hating you for no good reason. 
And when straight guys are being friendly and polite they **aren't hitting on you.**
OP is giving off major bottom vibes.
"Imo, you should drop the ""I'm definitely not gay"" thing. You should really just ditch labels all together, all they do is create situations like this where you're uncomfortable calling yourself something. 

Just do what feels right and don't sorry about what to call yourself is my advice "
"Read this article: http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/

I've had the same experiences though. Straight guys have been so chill and nice to me, and straight girls LOVE me, but gay guys have been so incredibly rude. It's fucked up."

I don't believe that any sexual fantasies are immoral except those that involve not having consent. 
"You don't have to decide how you're going to react- you just have to go with how you feel. You don't want to be around your brother right now, so don't be. Later on you might change your mind and want to see him and that will be ok. Don't allow him or his gf to put you on the spot as if it's somehow you who has to make some big decision about the future of your relationship with him. He's the one who's fucked up here- he's in the difficult position, not you. Just keep paying attention to how you feel at the time and base your reaction on that. He'll regret this- have no doubt about that. And he'll find his way to regret it all on his own- you don't need to help him there. "
"He 100% knows he has performance issues (premature ejaculation). He's seen porn. That's likely why he wanted to avoid dealing with you afterwards.

Your experience is kind of what it was like with the first guy I had sex with, only in my case, we were at my place, so he very quickly got dressed and left. Somehow, I ended up talking to a woman who'd had sex with him (he was bi-curious), and she said the same thing happened with her. My sense is that guys with this problem have some pretty serious self-esteem issues connected to it.   "
"I have some straight male friends who genuinely don't give a fuck if people think they're gay and do not allow their behavior to be policed through accusations of homosexuality. They introduced me to getting pedicures. 

All of which is to say that it's getting better. "
"&gt; and I couldn't just turn them away, especially when they sometimes had to drive for 30 minutes to get to my place.

Oh lord, no! You can ALWAYS turn someone away. For ANY reason - especially a legit one as you describe. "
Pretty sure that's just an average evening for /u/CIaptr4p
"I went out with her to have lunch today, and a part of me really wanted to share my life with her. My actual life. While we sat down to eat, I hesitated to say what I wanted to a few times. Then it happened. When I told her, I saw her facial expression. I knew what she was going to say before she even said anything. My family is very religious, (Christian household) and if that doesn't already give it away.. I had the usual lecture about how being gay is ""wrong"" or ""a sin"", but it didn't really make me feel anything. I guess because I prepared myself for it beforehand. She says that she'll keep it a secret from my dad and other siblings, which I was happily pleased to hear. I just wished she was more supportive, happy, or both for me. It's alright though! :) and sorry if this seems a bit too vague. "
It's cheating if you consider it cheating.

"When I was 8 years old, a hunky doctor removed my appendix.

Yep. My boyfriend is a little chubby. He makes me chub in my pants  
"I'm glad you shared this.

I've always told guys ""sorry, but I'm not interested"" and that's worked well for me. Most people are stable enough to handle polite rejection. It's the psychos that ask ""why not!?!?"" that you have to be wary about. "
"I think this is the best answer. Don't feed shit back into the world. If he's still an asshole, fuck him. If not maybe help him out."

"I love this XKCD comic. People don't seem to understand that free speech doesn't make them immune to the consequences of that speech.

"I mean, I agree with your last sentence, but that example isn't great. Being out in the workplace can be a big deal for people - every co-worker I've had has assumed that I'm straight, and it's annoying having to come out to people at work over and over. Plus, dealing with homophobic coworkers is a real and serious issue."
He probably will still steal it. People can act like they're your friend just long enough to rip you off and move on to the next sucker.

"I understand what you are saying. Some people are just attracted to masculine guys who are like them,and I know so many gay duded who do not like Rupaul. There is nothing wrong with that. I think the problem comes when people say that feminine gays are the reason some people have negative views of the gay community.The flip side is some feminine boys accuse masculine boys of trying to appease straight people. This is why I think the gay community is not as united as it should be."
"I've been wanting to talk about this for a while now. I absolutely love Sense 8, especially season 2. Writing for television hasn't been this organic since Season 1 of Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad. 

I think the most thoughtful part of the show is how they give insight into many different cultures and dilemmas from people around the world. People from different walks of life find a way to love one another for who they truly are is just fascinating. ❤️"

"Came twice in five minutes once, 69ing with a hot ex-military, mma fighter at Burning Man.  Was watching him spin fire poi, he noticed me watching and took his shirt off then went back to spinning.  Chatted him up, we did a little molly and went back to my RV.  Dude was just all around sexy as fuck, only time I've ever had a multiple orgasm."
"You had me at ""criticism of Buzzfeed"""
"because it's ""masculine"""
"Because you don't need gay culture. You can live your life just like ANY guy, you don't need to spent 5 nights a week dancing to Madonna at the gay bar or being an LGBT activist for pointless issues that don't affect you. "
"Hate to break it to ya, but I think you're boyfriend's cheating on you with me. :'("
"Lol I don't even know what people mean anymore by ""the community"". Like, overwhelmingly ""the community"" is a huge advocate for safe sex. And it's completely accepting of people that don't hook up or do drugs. Whenever people talk about ""the community"", it's full of whatever they want it to be. I feel likes it's just a stand-in so gay guys can feel like they're so cool when they're ""not accepted"" by it.
"
"This isnt very out there, but looking back gives me a laugh.

The day I came out to my parents the shit really hit the fan. Later that night I talked/argued it out with my dad, but he believed at 16 I was just too young to make such a definitive statement. After some silence, he looked up at me with tears in his eyes and said 

_""Is this why you like Modern Family so much?""_


I was struck by how utterly stupid, innocent and naive that question was, all I could do was give an incredulous ""Noooo!""."
"&gt; There is a lot of explicit content on this sub, would you be comfortable with children being exposed to that?

Welcome to the internet...? There's explicit content everywhere. If its not this sub its going to be another sub. This sub they can at least ask questions pertaining to relationships and sex that their sex ed likely doesn't cover. 

The posters will either be honest and post their age, which lets someone ignore them thread, or they will just not mention their age and you'll be answering their questions anyway. "
I'd get to know him in person first for a while until you feel comfortable that he won't steal your stuff.
"Yes! And they say that any gay guy who doesn't enjoy cross dressing or singing Cher and ABBA is experiencing internalized homophobia. Just because you're gay, it doesn't mean you have to conform to every gay stereotype. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with liking those things, but gay guys shouldn't villainize other gay guys who don't like those same things. Just be yourself!"
Were you the friend who outed a glee performer to his parents by accident?
Did you tell him?
"This made me smile, thank you so much!♥"
"If the situation was reversed would they help you out? That's probably what I would consider the most, and since they treated you the way that they did I probably wouldn't try as hard. "
"Then you have nothing to feel sorry about. You had no way of knowing to keep your mouth shut, you did your best to fix it, and you gave him a heads up. You're a good dude.

On another note, he was in Glee club and his parents didn't know. :/"
"Omg that visual aid, I'm dying.  Screw being worried about upsetting him, he behaved like an inconsiderate selfish prick."

Awwww he got half from you (I'm kidding don't downvote me)
"Someone once told me there was no such things as good kissers, just compatible kissers; those that both like the same style of kissing.

That said, I still think my way's best: just part your lips slightly and imagine you're trying to get them round one of their lips (the bottom one's usually easiest to go for). When you've got their lip in between yours then just a bit of suction and back off, then go back and repeat or go for the other lip. It's pretty simple and quite an intimate way of kissing. Try lingering on one of the passes and that ups the intimacy.

Also, as another has said, get your hands or arms round them. Don't think too hard about this though on your first few kisses cos you'll be focusing too hard on the kissing anyway. Just put them on their hips or round their waist. Back of the neck is a favourite of mine and a lot of people are sensitive there - I've gently rubbed some guys' earlobes before to decent effect as well.

Things that you can do wrong: make the whole thing really sloppy and wet, my current guy does that and you come away wanting to wipe your lips - not attractive - having your lips a normal amount of dry is fine. Also, don't go too wide on parting your lips when you're going in, I've had guys like open their entire mouth as if they're gonna eat me, that's nasty. Finally, do not go for tongue on the first few passes, go for it after that and do so just a bit to test the waters, some people don't like it.

But like I said, compatible kissers, not good kissers.

Edit - oh and yeh it's the same as kissing a girl, just to answer the question.

Edit 2 - oh and you'll basically work all this out by yourself. It mostly just goes on instinct."

"You need to change your behavior. 

He is emasculated in front of your friends and you allow that. 

Forget how strong he is. Forget how fem he is, start looking at how you respond with your friends. 

Your friends get the message that you are the top, he is the bottom. How do they know that? Do you talk about private moments with your social group? ( I knocked the bottom out of his ass last night? )

Your friends need a fact update, hey need to respect him for sho he is to you and they only get that message from you. "
You could try developing feelings for once.
That came out of nowhere
"It's interesting that you see the pre-anal that you did for ages as foreplay, something that didn't count.

From his perspective it could well be the case that he feels you had sex in different ways for ages, and then finished up a long session with a bit of anal, by which point he was so worked up that didn't last very long.

As everyone says, communication. Keep judgement out of your voice. Just be clear that you feel sex is finished when you both finish, and that's what you want to work towards from now on, whatever way it takes for you to get there. That that's more important than running the gauntlet of having sex every which way like a marathon."
Like fucked by a sandwich? 
"this is pretty much how i feel. i don't understand how he could adopt such beliefs, since we definitely weren't raised with them, and not question where his brother fit into his new world view. it just doesnt make sense to me. if i did ever talk to him i'd probably ask him about that. "
This is hardly the point of this post...
"The delusion is annoying, but on the other hand being attracted to men is still a negative thing to most people, even many who are somewhat ok with gay people, so at the same time it's understandable."
That a 'great ass' can also belong to a guy. 
"I agree with you on most points. But I would like to contest one thing. This isn't representative of all or even most straight males. Many go through different things and overcome struggles of their own. Most people are strong in different ways. And we should all respect that different people have had different experiences that make them who they are. We can usually learn a lot from each other and our experiences.

So I wouldn't lump all straight guys as not understanding the struggle others have gone through."
