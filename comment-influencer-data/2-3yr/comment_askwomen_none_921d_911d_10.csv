"The classic example:
&gt;Cassandra woke up to the rays of the sun streaming through the slats on her blinds, cascading over her naked chest. She stretched, her breasts lifting with her arms as she greeted the sun. She rolled out of bed and put on a shirt, her nipples prominently showing through the thin fabric. She breasted boobily to the stairs, and titted downwards."
"It was nauseating how many literotica stories had the female narrator listing her *measurements*. I know that's how I think of myself when I look into the mirror, or am getting dressed."

When the man has a keen sense of truth and a passion for justice and the woman has luscious red hair and alluring eyes. 
"man, I hate it when I have to breast boobily."
"Eyebrows are the big one to me. I remember in high school, a lot of the girls I knew plucked or waxed their brows down to almost nothing. Then a fuller look came back into vogue and everyone started scrambling, but I know one of my friends had plucked hers down so much they couldn't grow back."

"Yeast infection? You really should have scrubbed your vagina out with soap after you had sex.

Seriously. The number of times I have had this discussion is unsettling and astounding."
"My son is just... my favorite person. I don't even know how to put it into words. He's turning three next week, and he just has a love for me that is amazing. The nightly cuddles on the couch, the way he gets excited when he sees me at the end of a work day, and just watching him learn and know that I'm helping to shape him into this little person... it's incredible. And he just loves me because I'm his mommy. Last night I was leaving to go to the gym, and he asked me to stay. I said I needed to leave, and joked to my husband that it was because Mommy wants to get skinny. The child looked right at me and said, ""You don't need to be skinny Mommy. I love you."" He's THREE. What a little dude."
"Obviously all the physical stuff, but something I see a lot with men writing young female protagonists is that the character is rarely insecure or introspective. She never has moments of reflecting on femininity except perhaps the surface not-like-other-girls worries. I find this hard to relate to. I thought a lot about what it meant to be a girl when I was growing up. I often felt insecure in my performance of femininity; it didn't come naturally even though I am a cis woman who has a lot of stereotypical interests. Male heroes take awkward runs at masculinity and feel odd and uncomfortable, but I see this a lot less in female heroes written by men.

Similarly, men often write the young female protagonist's attitude toward boy characters who have crushes on her as a sort of all-knowing placidity--she sees his nervousness and is amused by it, and even sometimes toys with him out of a sense of playfulness. To me, this is projection on the part of the male author. He felt toyed with as a kid with a crush, so as an author he fails to imagine a more relatable experience for the protagonist: awkwardness, discomfort, or even obliviousness. "
"Butt size. I'm 31, when I was in middle school, I remember people were going crazy over smaller butts like Kylie Minogue's, there were exercising tips to reach that look on magazines and all. Then Jennifer Lopez got popular, Kim Kardashian followed, and big, round butts became the most popular."
"Too much awareness of her boobs or business bits. I rarely think about either myself, and it just seems really awkward when a fictional woman is hyper aware of her body parts. "
Boyfriend is into feet. Except not mine. Ayo. 
"I get stopped in the halls during class and yelled at. I have people yell ""where is your teacher?!"" When I'm sitting right there at the teacher's desk. I've had a security guard try and take my phone. I've gotten multiple threats to tow my car for parking in the faculty parking lot. 

The kids are constantly trying to find out if I party or smoke weed. 

I'm a high school substitute teacher and I'm 29. (I sub at multiple high schools so security/other teachers don't always recognize me)

EDIT: I want to add that I love my job and most of the time I don't get yelled at, I just have gotten yelled at before, for being in the halls during class time before or for sitting at the teachers desk or parking in the faculty lot."

"I had a guy tell me that I don't need to take the pill if I wear a condom every time I have sex. 

I explained to him several times that I need the hormones for my migraines, and the condoms because I don't trust the pill alone (besides STDs), but no. I'm just throwing money away because I want to. "
"Anytime women are talking about any kind of harassment (catcalling, internet harassment, sexual harassment at work, etc.) and some moron pipes up with ""Why don't you just ignore it?"" or ""Just tell them to fuck off!""

"If I keep persisting/following her,  she'll say yes! "
My *own father* told me that if I wanted pants with pockets I should just go out and buy them and that it isn't that hard. As if I'd be walking around in pants with inch-deep pockets or even fake pockets if I had a viable alternative.

"I had a guy explain how periods and fertility were related and that if I just paid attention to my cycle, I could avoid getting pregnant without needing to rely on birth control.

Really. I have been menstruating for 18 years, and Dr. Well Actually really thought I was not aware of how the whole gig worked (and gave terrible advice anyway)."
"There's technically a female lead, but she spends most of her time watching men do stuff, and thinking about stuff men do, and waiting for men to solve her problems. And thinking about men she has no real relationship with. And having things done to her by powerful men, ideally while she's tied up/powerless for some flimsy reason. (I'm looking at you, all of fantasy and disturbing amounts of sci fi.) And generally kind of being very much a placeholder for dudes to act upon, rather than an actual person with agency and her own plans and considerations. "
"My husband and I have been together for 17 years, married for 12. We have a one year old and a 3 year old. It took us 10 years of trying to get pregnant the first time. I thought that it taking so long would be a blessing in disguise. We had time to build our relationship, we did trips and concerts, we were spontaneous. Admittedly, I spoiled him, and ignored red flags. I put him first, always, and he relied on me. 

After our son was born, he checked out. Staying out 4 or 5 nights a week until 5am. My son and I were sleeping on the couch, because he'd get angry if the baby woke up at night. I finally insisted (after far too long) that we talk about it. He said he didn't want to be married, &amp; that he wanted my son and I to leave. We did, but even when we lived apart, we talked daily. We'd been best friends for most of our lives, and it turned out that neither of us really knew how to separate. A few months later, he was begging me to come back. I did, &amp; surprise! Got pregnant with my daughter. 

Things were ok for a month or so, and then he fell back into old patterns. Going out all the time. Getting angry at me for pregnancy symptoms. Yelling at our son. 2 weeks after I had our daughter, he told me that he'd been having an affair and wanted to be with her. He said he'd never loved me, wasn't attracted to me, &amp; regretted marrying me. He said the reason he begged for me to come back was because it pissed him off that I was moving in more quickly than he was. He moved out, &amp; there was a lot of animosity. About 4 months later, the kids and I came home from a trip and he'd moved back in. 

So here we are. Honestly, for the last 6 months or so, he's really been trying. He's only going out once or twice a month. He tries to be sweet and friendly to me. He's still no help with the kids, beyond occasionally playing with them. He still has a temper. 

Honestly, I'm done. I'm not happy, and while I still love him, it's no longer a romantic love. The one thing that keeps me ""in"" is the kids. I'm a sahm, and I've only ever hired babysitters once or twice. The only time he's taken care of our son on his own (never our daughter) is when he's asleep. I don't think it's fair, and I can't stand the thought of going entire days without seeing my children. It's not what I signed up for when having kids, and I don't think that the kids and I should have to sacrifice our time together, and their care &amp; wellbeing, just because he changed his goalposts. 

I know it's not sustainable. I can't stay in a miserable relationship forever. But I figure if I can hold out until both kids are in school, at least they'll require less hands-on care, and they can both articulate to me if something goes wrong at dad's. In the meantime, I focus on them, bide my time, &amp; get my ducks in a row. "
"I don't know if I like him or not anymore, which is a problem all by itself. He's so demanding, it's exhausting. All my time and energy goes into talking about our relationship, trying to make things work, and I don't even know if I want things to work. I don't know if I want to be with him or if I just want to be in a relationship so much that I'm willing to put up with him. I don't know what the hell I'm doing. "
"When I was little and my jelly shoes would pinch me, my dad would put them in the microwave and then he and my uncle would each take and end and try and stretch them out. I don't actually think it worked but I have a very vivid memory of it."
"
My SO and I have been together 4 years, living together for two and when I first moved in with him, for the first 6 or so months, before we would have sex he would excuse himself to the bathroom to look at porn for about ten minutes to get hard. I can still feel bitter about it here and there."
"Any male politician who thinks the solution to all abortions is for women to just keep their legs shut (rather than, you know, provide birth control and sex ed).  Beyond the fact that rape happens and that sometimes a wanted pregnancy goes sideways, they do realize this means less sex for straight dudes right?  Even the married ones who did everything correctly based on whatever religion they follow (including the politicians themselves), because most women these days (even the religious ones) would prefer to not be constantly pregnant.  Like I don't understand why they're trying so hard to make sure they get sexually rejected on a more frequent basis. 

Also, lots of data indicates that women are more sexually fluid than men are (I'm of the belief that this is probably more social than biological, but the reason doesn't really matter).  So really they're trying to create a situation where more women are in gay relationships and most men are sexless.  I don't have a fundamental problem with this on a personal level, but it seems like they're really working against their own interests. "

"And is always thinking things to herself like, ""I wonder if he noticed that my breasts seem more full today? With each step I took, I could feel their sway and bounce. And with my tiny waist, the soft jiggle of my breasts must have been even more emphasized as I hurried down the stairs - hips swaying, full lips parted to catch my breath. Surely he must have noticed each movement from my delicate step in high heels to the soft motion of my breasts as my breath grew faster."""
My favorite part is when they're describing a slender woman and the bra size they use is 42DDD. That is not the bra size of a slender woman. 
"I remember with my ex I got all dressed up and did my makeup for a date night. 
When he came to pick me up he started laughing at me and said I looked like I was trying too hard. I forgave him after I threw a huge fit but I still think about how ugly he made me feel."
"I'm 62 so I've seen a lot of things change. The more recent trend of labioplasty just seems insane to me. Men really don't care what you look like down there. When I was young there was a movement to just get women to get a mirror and see what they looked like down there, to touch it and be comfortable with their body.Now women are having surgery to make it ""pretty"". Another thing is shaving the pubic area, it had been a fetish, now it's the norm, and  hair down there seems to be the fetish. Men have been engaging in oral sex with women forever,!and they didn't die from a little hair. Stubble is hell, and cuts from shaving increases your chance for STD's. "
"Older women, if they appear at all, have no thoughts or worries about their own lives. They look out for the younger male protagonist, but do not mentor the young female protagonist. Their eye-rolling happens in the wrong moments and over the wrong things."

"1) The people mostly. It really really shattered my view of relationships and the world in general. I would see so much horrible things and see people do horrible things to others in the name of sex! And even though nothing super bad ever happened to me (in fact I probably had one of the easiest times escorting). It really just ruined how I felt about the world.

I once had a client who was a very good looking, ""normal"" guy who was married and  worked in finance try and hold me down and remove the condom (which I had not agreed to). He tried to threaten me with a bad review!  I realised he targeted me because I was new and young and he thought I wouldn't report him. ( I live in the Uk escorting is legal here)



2) realised I'm really just a human flesh light. People talk about it being empowering but I didn't feel empowered after a while. I just felt a bit used. Which I realised was my own issue and isn't representative of the entire sex industry. 


3) It made me crazy critical of myself and my looks! I had to be perfect and look perfect and perform really good! Or I might get a bad review. I had to be young! Smart! Well read! I had never cared about how I looked before !  Constantly having to depend on your looks and ""sexual expertise"" and ""personality"" to remain popular can get very draining and make you horribly insecure. 



4)I would hear a lot of guys talk about their wives and say how their wives ""don't put out"" ""they're not sexy enough anymore"" ""their wives are dull and NAG them all the time"". Which makes me so paranoid in my own relationships because now I never want to be the nagging, overweight girlfriend.



5)I started it quite young and I was in university and I feel that having to keep it hidden , having no one to talk to about it, having to deal with bad times by myself really really robbed me of a normal university experience. I couldn't get too close to people in case they found out and judged me. I can't let people know because some jobs won't hire me if they know! Etc. I couldn't just be a carefree happy normal uni student, which made me super bitter. 



6) I was contributing to partners cheating on their wives. Even if I didn't force them to cheat. I was still contributing to it! Knowingly! Taking money from people who had families, wives and girlfriends.

"She doesn't experience passive sexism. 

1. If a man harasses her, the male bystanders intervene. (There are no female bystanders.)

2. Harassment is always physical, and always has a sexual end goal. (Low-grade harassment tends to have a material end goal, like making a woman do some of your share of the work, or bring you things.)

3. Nobody who isn't a villain talks over her.

4. When something goes wrong/she has a counterintuitive idea, people who are not her friends or close relatives believe her.

5. When she stands up for herself, her behavior is recognized as something valid, instead of ""not being a team player"".

6. People might comment negatively on her appearance/demeanor, but nobody straight-up tells her *how* she should alter her appearance. (Real-life jagoffs tend to give an unsolicited suggestion instead of an unsolicited critique, because their driving motivation for commenting is the idea that you don't know how to groom/clothe/feed yourself properly. So why would they leave the solution up to you?)

7. If some rando *does* tell her how to change her appearance, she actually thinks about what they said.

8. Nobody congratulates her for doing something incredibly basic. People notice and appreciate when she has worked hard on something that's really *is* difficult.

9. Third parties don't pressure/expect her to accept the Nice Guy's romantic overtures regardless of whether they're a good match.  "
"Also, a lot of emphasis on what the nips are doing. I read a book that went something like:

&gt; Watching him, she felt her nipples growing hard with lust. He noticed, staring at her chest. ""It's cold"" she said. ""No,"" he replied with a wicked smile. ""It isn't""

Like, what. Who feels their nipples growing hard? Who can see it through the bra? Who is arrogant enough to not only comment on it, but also claim responsibility.

Eventually you'll get to the bottom of the issue, which is that they are sexist idiots whose opinions are shit, and now they and everyone around them knows it."

"&gt;He felt toyed with as a kid with a crush, so as an author he fails to imagine a more relatable experience for the protagonist: awkwardness, discomfort, or even obliviousness.  

Personally, I was more pissed off than awkward. All my friends were boys, and seemingly overnight, they all lost the ability to talk to me. And as far as I was aware, nothing about me had changed. I felt shunned. It came across as a recapitulation of the time in 1st grade when a bully had convinced every single girl in my class not to speak with me. And my mother's suggestion that my friends were treating me differently because they *liked* me was horrifying, because of the implication that I would never get to have a platonic friend again.

I rarely see rings with this much detail and it is what really set it apart from all others.  There are milgrain and etchings throughout the entire band.  It's kind of different than my usual style--I favor art nouveau, warm colors, and asymmetry--but this one suits me for every day wear.

I could do whatever I wanted at whatever time I wanted and I would fit ""work"" around it. I will no longer be able to wake up at 12pm on a Thursday afternoon and then do anything I feel like until my meeting in the evening. 

A meeting that would be a few hours but would make me ¬£1000+ to sit and talk/have dinner and have sex with someone.

Granted I started to hate the sex industry at the end.  But it gave me so much freedom and the money is quite good when you compare it to what others earn. I could earn what some people earn in a month in a day. 

It was also quite isolating. I spent most of my time alone or with one client or on cam! Or planning things for my profiles/ websites. So being around a lot of people every day! I'm not sure how I'm going to handle that. I might enjoy it or hate it given how shy  I can be. "

I stayed with him cause he made a very real and honest effort to change. We definitely did a tonne of work focusing on our relationship and making very specific promises regarding communication and expectations. But it was rough there, there were a good 3-4 months that it could have gone either way.

We're amazing now. Ideal relationship. We have a lot of love for and trust in each other, we've been together for a little less than a year and a half. He's come to India to visit my family, his nieces and nephews call me aunty.

"Oh god, the amount of ""impossibly beautiful"" intriguing women drives me insane. It's so archaic. I finished reading *Doctor Zhivago* recently and the main character's mistress' one major quality is that she is insanely beautiful, and therefore deserving of his love and obsession. Her main virtue is her enduring beauty, even when she's doing something as simple as ironing. Then I tried to detox with a quick spy story, which of course featured a female lead that was absurdly beautiful and mysterious. And enough with the wise, steel grey eyes. Does ANYONE have grey eyes??? 

Edit: Huh, TIL grey eyes not only exist but are extremely common. I have only ever really heard people talk about green, hazel, blue, or brown eyes. I probably mistake grey eyes for a very pale blue. My only familiarity with them has been as a literary cliche. "

"I've flew solo to Egypt before Arab Spring but met up with a group after I got there so I was never truly alone. I went Taiwan solo and worked abroad in the UK and Canada (whereupon I did all sightseeing by myself). I travel the US solo all the time. I love to travel solo to lots of other places but go with groups whenever I'm not comfortable with the language. 

This will sound unpopular but if you're in the US, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, North America, pats of South America, Iceland, Greenland, and Western Europe you're fine. Elsewhere... it can get a bit dicey. I'm one of those girls who thinks there are some places in the world you can't travel solo to as a woman, as unfair as it is.

I would never ever recommend doing the Middle East or India alone. Period. I hear horror stories about solo travel to India from friends and acquaintances, I've never been there myself but would like to go eventually (with a group). Egypt for me was mentally and emotionally exhausting, and in the end I had to have one of the guys from the group I joined go with me everywhere because the street vendors kept trying to molest me. Turkey was fine when my group was up north but when we got south towards the Syrian border (around Konya and a bit farther south) it started to get dicey, part of it due to the huge influx of Syrian refugees which has caused some instability. I traveled to Russia once with a tiny group of 6 people and that was an insane trip. Holy shit I would NEVER EVER recommend going to Russia as a solo female, the men in my group got robbed at the Red Square (they shielded me and the other girl in my group from the muggers) and at one point the police threatened us on the side of the road outside of Kaluga. Egypt and Russia both was huge eye-openers to how lucky I was to be an American woman.

Taiwan was great but it was difficult due to the language barrier. Super friendly people though, and boy can they eat.

EDIT - I completely forgot to include Australia, New Zealand, and a few countries in Southeast Asia on the list of good places to travel solo as a female. Sorry about that everyone! "

At the time I was 5'5"" 130lbs, and I didn't think I needed to be any thinner until that day... the context for this is that he has his own body image issues and thinks he is too thin, so I attribute his comment to having fears that he is not ""muscular and tall"" enough for me. So I try to reassure him that I love him the way he is. 

Honestly this still bothers me every time I think about it, so my solution is to not think about it. It is one comment in an otherwise amazing relationship, and he has worked hard to make up for it."

My husband and I dated for over six years before he moved in with me, so we were already very comfortable with each other. The feeling of needing to entertain the other person while home together (instead of just doing our own thing) went away after a couple weeks.

We still pee with the doors closed, and I personally prefer to get dried off and dressed before he sees me after a shower. I farted in front of him for the first time in 11 years this past November and it was on accident.

This man has seen me give birth and held me in the shower as I cried in pain during a miscarriage. I've rushed to his aid when he blacked out while sitting on the toilet and cleaned vomit out of his clothing.

But I'll be damned if he will ever see me poop. We're just not the type to ever ""let loose"" in that way."

I was actually inspired to ask this question because I  remembered a  moment in a sci-fi story where a girl wakes up after being asleep for several years as a teen or young adult (I forget which). If I remember right she was uncomfortably interested in her grown breasts and comparing them to another girl's. I also vaguely remember the author going into a little too much detail about how their clothes didn't fit them anymore. I didn't think about it too much at the time but the characters were mentality I think around middle schoolers.

"When female characters feel more like caricatures of women rather than ... Normal women. I just watched ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" and my best friend and I both agreed we related better to the men than the overly ridiculous girls. Which should be weird but I notice this across the board in films. It's not often I relate to female characters and usually find myself watching the male and going ""yup, that's me."" Maybe because male characters are often more developed than female characters and are given better treatment by the writer? Or that the majority of writers are male and aren't good at writing women in general? I'm not sure. 

When I think of women I relate to I immediately think of the women from Buffy the Vampire Slayer (I think Joss Whedon writes women incredibly well) and Girls (season 1 ONLY...). "
"Oh wow, as soon as you said this, a dozen examples of that popped into my mind, and I thought instantly about how unrealistic that always feels, and yet it's a constant.  The woman always knows that a man likes her, is flirting with her, is embarrassed around her because of his feelings, and often just doesn't let on, or uses it against him.  It never occurred to me till you said it that this is probably coming from male authors who assume women do know these things.  Awesome insight!"

"Thinking about the inner lives of older women she knows. I used to interrogate my babysitter, who was a teenager with an active dating life. I was fascinated by the way she dressed and did her makeup. I wanted to know her thoughts about everything. I was also deeply interested in the lives of my female teachers. Did she have a partner? Did she live alone? How old was she when she got her cartilage pierced? Is she happy or not? Does she like living here? 

I asked my mom about her life and there were certain stories I had her tell me over and over again, things that I felt I wanted to inherit from her. The moment where she rejected a marriage proposal when she was 18. That was important to me. I decided I would also be the kind of woman who would do that. And I digested my dad's opinions on women--that a woman should be sharp, a little angry, able to get out the door in under five minutes of primping. And conversely, that women who were frivolous or self-indulgent did not get his respect.

And I was very interested in the way femininity affected the way others perceived you--the performance of it versus the affected rejection of certain elements of it, etc. I would practice walking and sitting and moving my hands in ways I thought were pretty. But if you were too feminine/pretty then you weren't really cool; you had to choose which bits to perform. I knew a girl who dressed sort of sexy but she always sat with her legs apart and she had this big deep laugh. The masculine parts of her were made more attractive because of the contrast to the feminine parts. I tried to imitate that.

Basically I was just always thinking about it. Not always consciously, but definitely a lot more than girls in those books think about their girl-ness."

"I'm 28. When I think back to being a kid, it seemed that being very 'lean' and 'toned' for men and women wasn't such a big thing. Obviously 'thin' was still in, and what people saw as a healthy weight as still preferable, but I remember celebrities on TV and popstars who didn't have lower levels of body fat or chiseled abs/firm tight bodies etc (but still slim) walking around on TV with crop tops on, prancing around and called attractive, being in magazines and that sort of 'slim but not necessarily fit/toned/tight' body seeming to be more accepted. 

This might just be my imagination though. I was a fat kid and so just being 'slim' probably seemed like the be-all to me back then, but now I am thin, the goal posts moving to achieve an 'attractive body' might just be in my eyes/an illusion - maybe those goal posts were already there, but they were just too far for me to see before if that makes sense. Would be interested to see if anyone else agrees that it's changed or whether it's just me."

"I have a step son who has children, so I am a parent and grandparent without ever having actually birthed a living human.

I take pride in the accomplishments of my son and grandchildren, but I know I shouldn't really because they are not mine biologically and my contributions to their success are mitigated by 3/4 - I am 1/4 of a parenting team that includes 2 natural parents and another step-parent.  

I love them unconditionally and shamelessly spoil them; but I feel sort of like an outsider watching them grow and succeed from afar.  I don't feel like a ""real"" grandmother or parent.  I'm a substitute or a spare.  

So, I do wish I had a child of my own sometimes.  A child with my DNA who looks a little like my father and grandmother.  A child I could parent and teach and love without their natural parent looming over my shoulder.  A child I can fully take pride in as their only mother.    A child I never had to put on a plane to see their ""real"" mom for a summer or Christmas vacation.  One who would love me unconditionally, not one who grows to love me because I married their father or grandfather.

Sorry, I get wistful and teary eyed thinking about this.  

In a few years, my husband will die and his son will focus on his own family and his own mother.  I'll move to a retirement community next to the lake (I have one picked out). I'll live there with my cat(s) with occasional visits from my nieces and nephew, and maybe my grandchildren.  I'll travel, take cruises, join a church where I can sit in quiet contemplation of my life choices and silent judgment of people who don't matter.  

And eventually I'll die there: alone, but for the cats who will selfishly eat my face and leave a mess for the coroner to find.  

The inevitable loneliness of aging, I suppose, is one thing that makes me regret not having children of my own."

Edit: And women slapping men in romcoms meant to be funny or something. It's usually done because the guy said something inappropriate. No one deserves physical abuse because their words hurt you. If someone physically goes for you and you think a slap in return might get them away from you then fair enough (although someone about to physically abuse *you* in the first place would probably just be more angered by a slap and more determined to overpower *you*), but rarely in romcoms are men slapped for anything more than just shitty words"
"Outdoor wedding in July during a heatwave with no shade. I got extremely sunburnt. 

The bride wanted a photo of all the guests in a heart shape with them in the middle, sounds sweet right. What it actually meant was 45 minutes in the blistering sun with the photographer leaning out of a three story window trying to direct the crowd into a heart shape. 

Also the wedding was weirdly gendered. The starters for example, the men got Pate and toast and the women got Melon balls and parma ham. Same with the mains and the dessert. At the end of the wedding, all the men got lottery tickets as favours ""So they can get as lucky as the bride and groom"" and the women got Seeds ""So they can grow their future family"" as favours. I'm not making this up those were genuinely the words written in the cards. 

Also the bride insisted on having a men VS women dance off. Which was incredibly cringy. "

He proposed over the phone while we were both stationed very far away from each other.  He had the heart shaped diamond specially cut for me as an engagement diamond in Hong Kong.  Two years later I had a CZ set into a Tiffany setting and wore it with a plain gold band.  That was replaced with a 22 diamond channel set anniversary band, and eventually he got a solitaire diamond set into my original Tiffany style setting.  That set is on my ring finger and is as close to my ""actual"" set as it gets.  The chevron diamond is from the year I beat breast cancer, and I wear it often when I don't want to wear the Big One.  He also got me the Waterfall sapphire band, and a small princess cut with two blue diamonds, as anniversary gifts.  I wear the sapphire set a lot, it doesn't sit too high and it pretty as heck.

On my middle finger is my $6 stainless steel ring for travel or daily wear.  The three stone band, and the three color band are just Kay things on clearance, which he liked and got for me.  I wear them now and then.  

On my index finger are just color solitaires I wear with a tiny slim band and a couple emerald rings I wear as a set now and then.  Not really engagement rings, but since I wear them as wedding rings when the mood suits me, I included them too.

He has agreed to stop with the diamonds.

He wasn't doing it to be a jerk, I think he was just trying to be upfront, but man that made me feel awful, like I was just another number. 

These days (2 years later) he never says 'I love you' first and has almost never told me he thinks I'm pretty, attractive etc. I don't think I'm needy, but especially when we're going somewhere nice and I've made effort, it'd be nice to hear that he notices.

It's not like I got teased for my natural hair when growing up but you also didn't see many black women rocking their curls, and the one black female at my school wore a weave from time to time.

Now the, well I call them mocha baby curls, are a thing regardless if your  hair does them  naturally or not. It's curly enough where it looks ethic but it's not like a straight up afro you'd see in the 60s but like these cute bouncy curls. So I guess bigger hair instead of traditional long and straight.

"I'm mentoring some 7th grade girls for a STEM program where we teach them some code and do a bunch of career building and stuff. During the first week, we were having an intro discussion on characteristics of women working in STEM, and one girl said something to the effect of ""Well, a woman working in STEM wouldn't be girly or wear dresses because those girls are usually dumb."" 

I just made a confused face and said to my fellow mentor ""I know quite a few girls who are very beautiful and wear very nice clothes and they're *very* smart. What about you [fellow mentor]?"" She replied ""Yep, when I go to my biology conferences, there are a lot of very intelligent girls presenting who are also very pretty. Even you all - you're all beautiful, and I think most of you will prove to us that you're also very smart. It's definitely possible to be both."" And then I continued with the discussion that perhaps women working in STEM might dress professionally and presentably etc.

It was definitely interesting hearing that come from the mouth of a 7th grade girl though."
"My cousin's. It was 36C and it was outside with no shade and his bride was 1h late to the ceremony, which went for about 1h. The celebrant was terrible too and made lots of smarmy judgemental religious comments. It started at 3 and we got dinner at 10.30pm as the bride wanted hours of photos. The reception was held in a barn without aircon and each speech went for 30min and we could not eat during the speeches or each dance the bride decided to do. There were also lots of comments about how they won't be a proper family until they have had kids, which was pretty hard for an infertile family member to hear (they were aware of this). 

I also could not drink as I had driven there so didn't even have alcohol to save the day. It struck me as a wedding to get nice photos to put on Pinterest rather than any consideration for the guests and them having a pleasant time. It was so fucking boring and uncomfortable and some of my family asked me how my wedding would be done (mine was the next one) as they were still traumatised from hers :P before they would accept an invite to my wedding. 

She left him about six months later too :\ My poor cousin was devastated. "
"One moment that struck me was in an episode of *West Wing*.

SO SHE WALKS DOWN THE DARK HALLWAY UNDER THE SABOTAGED LIGHT TO THE 'NOBODY WILL HEAR YOUR SCREAMS' OFFICE TO SEE WHAT'S UP.

Turns out it was a surprise party, but seriously. No woman is that clueless about the danger angry men pose to us. Male writers clearly are, though."
"Yeah, the very recent changes in body hair removal trends are something I've noticed a lot. One that always stands out to me that I think I originally found out about through this sub when people talk about their normal shaving habits is the removal of arm hair among people even only, like, three or four years younger than me (I'm 29). I remember that being considered weird when I was still in school. Hair removal standards in general have gotten much much stricter, really, as more and more people find hair disgusting and dirty for whatever reason. We've even started drawing guys into the fray. Honestly, I find it pretty disappointing.

I remember when shaving off all of your pubic hair wasn't as common. It was normal to either go with a landing strip or just ""clean up"" the bikini line. Nowadays, you pretty much *have* to be completely bare or you're seen as disgusting, smelly, dirty, lazy, etc, etc, etc. I, again, see a lot of those attitudes in this very sub (and in general, of course). You'd never know that the majority of people survived having pubic hair just fine in the very recent past.

Gah... I'm ranting at this point. The super strict body hair standards really bug me, and I often feel like a broken record defending body hair over and over and over.

Someone else mentioned this one as well: tanning. Used to be a huge trend but abruptly disappeared."
"It was for my dad's cousin. She was remarrying and had become a Jehovah's Witness. The dude she was marrying was also on his second marriage. The minister gave a huge speech about how she had been made directly out of his rib just for him, and 10 year old me, who knew they had both been married before, though this was super stupid and wondered aloud how many ribs the groom had left. "
"When we're both on opposite sides of the room working or doing a hobby, every so often he'll woof at me to check in that I'm fine. We're at the point where we can have a conversation using woofs and meows."
"This probably won't work for everyone, but I restored my self-esteem by fucking other men who told me I'm hot af. (With his permission. I wasn't cheating on him.) 

Then I realised I was done feeling worthless and unattractive to my own husband, so I told him I wanted a divorce. 

Suddenly, he realised all those times I talked about this being a serious issue actually *were* serious, and he started making more effort. He begged for a second chance and convinced me to give him a month to improve. He did improve. It took lots and lots of conversations and communication and crying and hurt feelings... He apologised a lot, made me list everything that was a problem, and actually *listened* to me and made effort to resolve everything. (I also am making effort to communicate again now instead of assuming he still won't care, and trying to be explicit about *exactly* what I need from him.) I'm still not 100% convinced he won't stop trying again later, but for now things are much much better. It's been a few months now. 

If he fucks this up I'm done. He's on his last chance. We're rebuilding the relationship though and hopefully soon it'll be strong again. :) "

"Present - Boyfriend gets up earlier than I do, and kisses me on the forehead before leaving for work. Also, he listens to me when I vent, and doesn't offer a solution unless I ask him how to resolve a problem I have. Though he does like to argue, we do so in an adult, calm way and see each other's points. 

Past - My father.  While I may disagree with his political views, and question some of the things he says, he provided so much for me as a kid. I was a gymnast for a very long time, and we didn't have a lot of money growing up. He built me a beam in our backyard so I could practice. Once I quit gymnastics and started playing softball, he was out there every day pitching to me to help my batting game. Also, according to him and my mother, he was my sole provider and care giver as an infant as my mother had severe postpartum depression and wouldn't even hold me for the first few months. 

Edit: added past regarding dad. "
"I am in actual tears of laughter at your comment. I loved that trilogy but you're so right. See also: the Robert Langdon books (The Da Vinci Code, etc) by Dan Brown. The author doesn't even *try* to make Robert Langdon super appealing; he's just a mild-mannered bachelor who knows his own field of study. Nothing amazing. And yet miraculously, some beautiful female scientist 15-20 years his junior always falls wildly in love with him. Over the course of, like, 3 days. When they're being chased by nefarious shadowy societies like the Illuminati. And he kisses her and then breaks her heart by valiantly telling her, ""Sorry, girl. But I live the single man life for life,"" while walking off into the sunset alone, leaving a pining woman behind. "
"That he's not interested in what I do at work. Doesn't want to know if I've been bitten, kicked, spat at and punched at work (I work with elders with dementia and it gets intense).

"Old white conservative dudes: You can't have birth control. Or abortions. Or maternity care.

Also those same dudes: Being a mother is the most important job a woman can have. Also, marital rape isn't real.

"There was a guy who didn't understand why all girls and women don't get IUDs, since he thought they were the perfect birth control.

"There is no ""First Lady of Canada"". Unlike some other countries, the prime minister's spouse has no official duties or responsibilities, no defined role. [Read a bit about it here](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/11/04/prime-minister-wife-sophie-gregoire_n_8464096.html). Because of this, her personal views are in no way a reflection of the government or her husband, and should be treated as such.

Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau has been a long time feminist activist, and was the ambassador for Because I am a Girl before her husband was elected. I don't find her comments surprising at all. She has good intentions but poor wording, IMO. 

Edit: put ""nominated"" instead of ""elected"" for some reason"
"oh man so many things. Every time she laughs, does something new, hugs me, gives me a kiss, comes to me for comfort, seeing my husband be a great dad - playing with her and how much she loves him. The way she runs to me and gives me a hug when I've been away for longer than 20 minutes. I love watching her read to herself (she's only 1.5). I love how when she wants me to read she goes and picks out a book and then backs into me to sit on my lap. I love how excited she gets about things she enjoys. I love everything about her, I remember thinking before she was born how strange it is to love someone so much that you've never even met. Yes she is hard sometimes but I wouldn't give up being with her all day for anything in the world. "
"I've encountered a lot of guys, sometimes even otherwise pretty smart ones, who are convinced that hormonal birth control of any kind, used in any circumstance, is some sort of super nefarious plot to.....ruin women I guess?  The argument is that it is ""unnatural"" and harming women in vague and unspecified ways (sometimes the guy will mention the actual potential side effects of birth control, but usually it boils down to some variation of ""unnatural"" and ""messing with your body"").  These guys usually have *no* issue with any other use of synthetic medication for any other reason, or other ""unnatural"" things women do to their bodies (aside from sometimes shaving).  They just really, really, really, really hate the idea of a woman using birth control other than perhaps condoms.  I've had guys get visibly angry and even upset, like I was afraid they were going to cry, when arguing about whether birth control, particularly the pill, should exist.  They have a lot of explanations about how, in fact, the rhythm method is actually one hundred and seventy-six percent effective if you do it correctly.

I have to wonder if they just really want to be daddies, or.....???"

"One person steals the entire show for me really... he made me feel truly desirable in all that I am as a woman.  There were moments when he'd walk around the bed and just look at me and take me all in with his eyes.  He'd tell me how I was perfect exactly as I was and for the first time in my life, I believed in my heart that I could be worth something to someone.  

In all honesty, there was only one person who I wanted to be desirable to from that moment on... him.  Those were some of the most amazing moments in my life... they definitely changed something permanently within me.  I've never been the same since.  "

"&gt; Any male politician who thinks the solution to all abortions is for women to just keep their legs shut

It's actually the reverse. They think the way to make women keep their legs shut is to ban abortions.

Abortion has never been a political issue - until women started fighting for independence. When the first women applied for admission to Harvard medical school, one suddenly saw academics at Harvard start to argue against a woman's right to abortion. That lead to the first laws banning abortions."

Hahahaha, I love it.

Edited to add clarification: The reason I found this suggestion hilarious is because (as the women here know) if you go without a bra you will get like 1000000 times the normal amount of male attention. Also, going braless is a no-go in most workplaces...like a guy not wearing pants.

"Well, I can't say I was absolutely, definitively proven right. But I think I did the right thing. 

I was 17. A guy at a bookstore asked me out. He said he was 19. I was very flattered to be asked out by someone in college. We met at a movie theater. At the theater, he kept trying to kiss me. I wasn't not into it, but I wanted to see the movie too. He put his hand down my shirt and I moved it to my leg. He rolled his eyes at me but kept it there. Otherwise he was OK. He'd obviously tried to dress up, he was complimenting me in a non-skeezy way. 

The movie ended and we went outside. It was maybe nine at night. He asked if I wanted to go for a walk. It was a large shopping center and there would be people there at nine at night, but for whatever reason my brain just ... sounded the alarm. I've never felt anything like it before or since. Just a full-body, completely silent *NO*. 

I said, ""Maybe we should just wait for your ride."" He said, ""But it's so cold out here. Can we sit in your car with the heat?"" I said yes, because the people coming out of the theater were thinning out and he was much bigger than me. 

In the car he kissed me, and I thought, You must do this convincingly or something very bad will happen. So I kissed him back as if I were thrilled to have met him. I remember thanking him for the date while feeling like I was going to throw up. It took half an hour for his ride to show up. It was a very long half hour. 

Finally he left, and I went home completely confused by my own reaction. He called me 25 times over the next few days and I didn't pick up. I never saw him again.

I googled him about a year later to find out what had happened to him. The only result was someone with his somewhat unusual name, but who was several years older. He'd been convicted for a particularly violent rape. There was no photo with the news article. 

So I don't know if that was him. But that *NO* was one of the weirdest things I've felt in my whole life. I'm glad I didn't go with him."

I moved to another country to live with him, after we had been a couple long-distance for two years. I've been here now for almost six years.

I never felt like I got the emotional support I needed through it all from my partner, and the romance that we expected just became a day-to-day grind. He has a teenage son who I never really got super close to. His son is now living with us full time. He's a difficult kid, and it's been really hard on our already strained relationship since he is so focused on his son and his issues. Our relationship takes a back seat, and I have very little control over my home environment. 

I'm moving out just due to the stress of it all but I want us to stay together as a couple. I'm hoping that having my own place will help me find myself again.

"The rhythm method can actually be really effective for some people! The problem is there's quite a few prerequisites like:

1. Having a fairly stable cycle.

2. Having the time/willingness to chart your cycle and ideally do things like check your body temp and vaginal line consistency as well.

3. Not doing stupid shit like deciding you're really horny on a fertile day and need sex now even though there aren't condoms in the house.

3 is really where most people have the biggest issue tbh."

They're pretty cheap so I would say go for it!"

"Yes, I read the book. I understood what John Green was trying to do. Not only did I feel he did it very poorly (many readers walked away from that book totally missing the fact that he tried to deconstruct the MPDG), it also didn't excuse all the other Manic Pixie Dream Girls (and Guys! Augustus is so unreal) in his other books, such as Alaska. As an author, I find his works to be highly contrived. He wants so badly to stuff them full of ~deep thoughts~ and everything comes off so bloated and pretentious. Not to mention, it's almost always middle-class white teenagers falling in love with some POC sidekick made of stereotypes (a Muslim kid who calls everyone ""kaffirs""? Seriously? Has John Green ever met a Muslim?) and a healthy dose of sexism and body-shaming sprinkled in here and there. Oh, and I'm not into the whole let's-have-people-make-out-in-Anne-Frank's house thing or the let's-romanticize-sadness-and-disease thing. 

Suffice to say, I am not a fan of John Green's books. Sorry if you like them. They just REALLY rub me the wrong way."

"Please teach me how. I had to go to a friend's dinner once, and one of their friend's blatantly said that she was a sexist. I was all ""???"" because what woman even says that. She kept saying she didn't believe men and women were equal and I tried to explain that, no shit Sherlock, we're not equal in our abilities (like she meant), we just want equal opportunities. AND IT STILL DIDN'T GET THROUGH TO HER.

She's a law student."

"I did NOT want a doorknob of an engagement ring. Yes, they can be gorgeous, but what happens when I try to put my hands in my pocket? Is it going to get stuck on everything?

"I traveled to NYC when I was 18. I stayed there for about a week and had no problems. Honestly, everyone was really kind and helped me out. I got lost a few times and people would stop and ask if I needed help. Guess I looked like I didn't know where I was. Cops were super helpful and friendly. A few locals told me what I should check out instead of going to Times Square. During a play I got sick and the theater peeps gave me water and put me in a room to recover. They kept checking on me and asking if I was all right and if they needed to call me a cab.

TLDR: NYC was awesome and the people took the time to help me out. "
"I hate seeing really small fingernails and toenails (on adults obviously), they gross me out. I know people can't help how big/small their fingernails and toenails are, but it still bothers me."
"Describing the woman with fruit, i.e. ""her cherry lips,"" ""her pear shaped body,"" ""her breasts like ripe apples."" 

I was a short story editor for a few years. These descriptions were in every male written female character. Makes you think about objectification. We are literally reduced to food. "

"I mean, he's not an author, but I'd say Hayao Miyazakis is pretty damn good at ""writing"" female characters. Well, I guess he does count if we include manga in here since Nausicca was a manga first before being turned into a film."
"But you're looking at your measurements from the perspective of yourself: a self-conscious woman. When male authors list measurements, even though the narrator is a (presumably straight) woman, her perspective reflects that of a turned-on straight man. (I.E. *My voluptuous double-D breasts and neat 22-inch waist...*) Because the author is writing from his male gaze. That's why it's so weird. "
"Trans people are the newest scapegoat. It's not as acceptable to target gay people anymore, so they just switched over to a more vulnerable group.

Like using public restrooms wasn't stressful enough for gender nonconforming people. These bigots had to make it a million times worse."
"Came to comments to post this. The interview is cool and the tampons bit is just ridiculous. Her deadpan response was perfect.

The quote from the interview (source: https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/RideSK/RideSK_10-22-02.htm ):

*Ross-Nazzal:¬†I had a question. I read an article recently that was published by¬†Florida Today, and you had talked about what they had to add to the flight kit on STS-7, for instance, things like tampons. And there was a discussion about whether or not you should bring makeup on board the flight. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what else was included in the flight [kit], if you had any suggestions, or if they had any suggestions that you were opposed to, and why.

Ride:¬†It‚Äôs actually kind of funny, because there was a reasonable amount of discussion about it. The engineers at NASA, in their infinite wisdom, decided that women astronauts would want makeup‚Äîso they designed a makeup kit. A makeup kit brought to you by NASA engineers. [Laughter] So, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù You can just imagine the discussions amongst the predominantly male engineers about what should go in a makeup kit. So they came to me, figuring that I could give them advice. It was about the last thing in the world that I wanted to be spending my time in training on. So I didn‚Äôt spend much time on it at all. But there were a couple of other female astronauts, who were given the job of determining what should go in the makeup kit, and how many tampons should fly as part of a flight kit. I remember the engineers trying to decide how many tampons should fly on a one-week flight; they asked, ‚ÄúIs 100 the right number?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. That would not be the right number.‚Äù

They said, ‚ÄúWell, we want to be safe.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúWell, you can cut that in half with no problem at all.‚Äù [Laughter]

And there were probably some other, similar sorts of issues, just because they had never thought about what just kind of personal equipment a female astronaut would take. They knew that a man might want a shaving kit, but they didn‚Äôt know what a woman would carry. Most of these were male engineers, so this was totally new and different to them.*

EDIT: fixed the link. I'll also add that I read elsewhere that the male engineers thought it would be a good idea to tie the tampons together with their strings like sausage links. And again, Sally Ride was like... no."
"My roommate is new to this city, but she's flourishing as an artist. She makes a lot of jokes about how single she is, but she is super busy with all her art shows and work.

Out of the blue, my BF told her she should make more ""mistakes."" As in, hook up with more guys that are below-average, to do them a favor, and also so she can get some. It was really fucking odd. I don't think he understands that her jokes are just jokes, and she's not exactly struggling with getting some- she's just too busy. Later that night, I said to her, ""At our age, we've had sex with enough 'mistakes,' amirite?"" and we burst out laughing at how weird that advice was."
"In SO many movies they make the other person seem like a villain. But dude, there is a reason they are together. 

In real life, if the person you are in a relationship with turns out to be a ""villain"", you don't just fall in love with the person who showed you the truth. You are heart broken and miserable and doubt yourself. 

Cheating is not romantic, and romcoms always fail to show how the person who was cheated on or left behind is feeling. It makes me so mad!"
Ok I find the mentoring thing extremely patronizing myself.  I never asked coworkers to give me some generic life advice that I already know.  
"The actual effects of teen parenting on both the parents and the children. Oh sure, there's a lot of shame, but the other side seems to be pretending nothing is wrong. There was a PSA campaign a while back that tried to show with statistical data the effects of teen parenting, but it was heavily criticized for being teen-mom-shaming even though it was just facts. Critics said that we should focus on sex ed and birth control access, and that's true, but that does little good if people aren't given the correct information needed to make informed choices. "
"There has been more awareness of mental illness, but there's also been some a lot of backlash in recent years. People who will say something like you're just trying to be special or ""trendy"" if it's something you acknowledge about yourself. And people trying to make abortion illegal in places where it's legal. "

Also I would really really rather not see you perform quasi-sexual acts in front of us and then throw the removed undergarment into the crowd.

"Alternatively. 

&gt;I have made the main character a girl. Phew. Now I can relax with the other characters. 

And like, 75% (or worse) of the rest of the characters in the book end up being guys. 

I never used to notice it before, but you'll have the main character, and maybe a mother/best friend/romatic rival etc. and then basically the rest of the entire cast of the book will be dudes. "
"I hope everyone's ok with me giving my perspective as a Dad, but having kids is the best thing that ever happened to me.  

Seeing a person develop and grow and turn into a person is just so incredible. There are definitely frustrations and hardships along the way, and it's hard to describe all the little things that happen every day that make the whole thing worthwhile, but here's an example of one that happened recently.  

My five year old daughter wanted to play a board game with me, but we couldn't find the dice. I was trying to get dinner started, so I told her, keep looking for the dice, and if you find it we can play after dinner. About 20 minutes later, she came up and told me, ""Daddy, we played and I won, and you lost."" I asked if she had found the dice, and she said no, but I found this, and showed me a rock. Apparently she sat there rolling for both of us, and, as she put it, ""I wanted sixes, and that's what kept coming up. You rolled a lot of ones.""  

I get to experience something like this almost every single day of my life. It's incredible."
"This is my worst nightmare about threesomes. I'm terrified that some guys in relationships just want to do them as a ""get out of jail free"" card to fuck other people without ""technically cheating"". 

You are much stronger than me, because I would have dumped him the second he stopped having sex with your friend (and I only say after, because I would have just immediately left the room the second I became ignored). 

I have to ask, what explanation did he give you for ignoring you...and how the hell did you mend your relationship after this?"
Then I'm fucked :(
"Hmm, I wonder if there's a biological reason for that..."
I'm 22. I used to be made fun of because I have full lips and thick eyebrows. Look who's laughing now.
"We didn't like each other anymore. We would talk about hypotheticals like ""what if I don't want to live with you all year?"" ""Could we be non-monogamous?"" ""Would you be mad if I regularly worked 100hrs a week?"" I finally put the pieces together and we split."
Ugh... this so much. I cringe so hard every time. Happens quite a bit in movies. 
"I never really got back into the normal work force, I wound up doing sex work because no one else would give me a chance. I had gotten fired from the last job I had at the start of my transition, in a way that was hardly subtle and very certainly related to me transitioning. No one ever hired me from that point on. I looked for work for 3 years straight, went to 20+ interviews and none of them wanted me. The sad part is that I've never really been bad at the jobs I've held, I'm just a type of person society feels uncomfortable around publicly. I pass much better now, and post ffs I could probably go stealth so if I went looking today I'd be more likely to find work, as transwomen who can't pass are pretty much pariahs."
This just breeds unhappiness 
"I've been with my partner for almost 15 years, we have sex 1-2 a day. 

I lust after him in an indescribeable way. I feel like we know each others bodies now that he could bring me to orgasm through telepathy if needed. I can't be in the same room with him without wanting to tear his clothes off, and I know he feels the same way. We do have kids, so we keep it above board when we need to.

As not_doing_that said, a LTR need not be the sex death march. We slept together on our first date and literally haven't stopped since then. 

"
"I can relate to this. I walked away and the months that followed were extremely difficult. I did a lot of second guessing.
1.5 years later and my life is so much better. Definitely one of the best decisions I've ever made."
"Age 23, consulting my doctor about depression, he told me that I should go buy a nice dress or something but I got back at him by not taking *him* seriously and getting another doctor."
"I am by no means saying the entire world is like this. But there is a certain background-radiation type of bullshit that most guys are completely oblivious to. 

Just for example, I wear makeup because on the days that I do:

1. People do what I tell them to without asking stupid questions.

2. I sometimes get free soda, or extra fries, or something. (I never ask, it just kinda *happens.*)

3. I get the full benefit of the doubt. (I have ADHD, and it's not like I can open conversations with the fact that I have a non-physical, non-obvious disability. There are days I *need* customers to see me as an adorable ditz, because that's a lot harder to yell at than a lazy idiot. IME, the only thing that shifts me between those two categories in people's minds is how much care I take with my appearance.)

Prettiness is not a goal for me; it is a means to an end that has absolutely nothing to do with sex or romance. Yet everyone who has ever talked to me about my appearance (most of the people I know) has done so with the assumption that my goal is to look as pretty as possible, so that I can find a husband.  

I don't blame anyone for thinking that, because if all you're getting is the visual, how are you supposed to know that? Humans *can* learn by observing, but our default is to learn by listening. If something never happens to you, and you've never heard a story about it, it's kind of ludicrous to assume you'd notice it. Humanity observed gravity on a daily basis for hundreds of thousands of years before Isaac Newton called it to our attention.

This is both the value of and the problem with storytelling. When you're learning about the world, you use other people's stories as reference. Put together, they build what you think is a consensus view of how the world works. But since most well-known stories are told by men... even if you've read all the modern classics, you're missing half the data points. You may have even *discarded* the female data points you've managed to come across, because they were so different from the majority of your references. You may have concluded - after careful thought - that they had to be aberrant. 

Thus, barring a great deal of personal effort and suspension of disbelief, the chain of ignorance gains another link and binds another generation. 

(Okay, so I'm a *little bit* salty.)

Fortunately, realizations are like mushrooms. They hide in the dark, and you'll recoil from their implications just as you do from the smell of manure. But... but. Once you locate the first one, you find yourself surrounded. And then you can take them with you, to somewhere much brighter.

TL;DR
1. I've already written out your ""not all men"" rebuttal. 
2. Sleep-deprived apologetics lead to mixed metaphors. Good ideas are best expressed while fully conscious."
"Gender segregation of children, especially when it comes to toys and media and even clothing. Things are way worse than 30 years ago.

Sex. The normalization of hardcore porn has basically convinced the entire younger generation that sex is about men dominating women and that doing things like slapping, choking, and pulling hair are standard. All very disrespectful to those who do not consent to it or find it sexy.

Reality TV culture has basically degraded what used to be dignified institutions like the Presidency, and the trickle down to popular culture is that everything is crass and vulgar. Fewer people have dignity or class these days."

-not wanting to have any conversation at all




-pretending to be interested in a long-term hookup situation but then ghosting after 2-3 times. (I don't have a problem with being dumped, but being ghosted after sex feels horrible, and just makes me not want to have sex with anyone again, ever.)





-outright telling me that I'm ugly / not girlfriend material AFTER the deed. WTF is wrong with some people? Maybe your standards are lower for sex but keep that to yourself please.

"I was 26, pregnant, and I just knew something was wrong with my pregnancy. I thought maybe the baby had one of the birth defects we heard a lot about back then (17 yrs ago) like down syndrome or Spina bifida. My doc ordered an extra ultrasound because I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was really, really wrong. 

Ultrasound (regular ultrasound) looked fine and I had no big risk factors. 

The worry got so bad that I switched my delivery to a large academic research hospital next door to a Childrens hospital. 

Delivery was perfect. She was perfect. I decided I might be crazy. And then, she was blue, really, really blue O2 sats 55-60 that wouldn't come up with oxygen. 

She had a complex cyanotic congenital heart defect (ccchd) and a non-communicating circulatory system. 

She was brought with great speed to the children's cardiac intensive care unit and given prostaglandins to re-open her fetal circulatory system until they could figure out what was wrong. 

She had open heart surgery #1 on day 3 of life. #2 on day 14 of life and then 2 more over the next couple of years. 

She's mostly  fine now. Almost 17, lovely, smart, honor roll, etc. She'll never have a normal heart, but with clothes on most people have no idea what she's been through. She has a good life and a good life expectancy. 

I believe, and so do her specialists, that she would have suffered (at best) brain injury due to lack of oxygen in any other delivery situation. At worst, she would have died."
"The day after we found out I was four weeks pregnant, SO went out for dinner with a friend and dropped me at my parents to celebrate the good news. The plan was after dinner he'd pick me up on the way home. Instead he went on a bender, turned off his phone and didn't see him until 11 the next day. I was so upset and embarrassed that my parents watch the whole thing unfold. Still don't know how my dad contained himself and didn't box him out when he stumbled in."
"Women are portrayed as weak when they have weaknesses rather than human. They lack psychological range, meaning if they're courageous they are ALWAYS courageous in every element of their lives, if confident then always confident, if arrogant always arrogant, bitter always bitter, mean always mean, etc. They suffer from the ""my greatest strength is also my greatest weakness"" error (she's too nice, too strong, too self-confident, etc.). And most of all she never lacks certainty -- this is true of villains and heroes alike. Male writers tend to write decisive women who are positive of their path and actions. Real women dither and worry a lot regardless of the front they show the world. Women have doubts. We have fears. We have panic attacks and nervous breakdowns after stressful situations -- *we have anxiety*. It feels like men are often worried about writing whiny females who come across as victims, so they overcompensate by writing women without any emotional distress (or almost worse, a male hero who cracks her tough gal exterior to find the gooey center beneath). Let your women cry occasionally and be ok with that in between saving the world. And super important -- let her cry *on the shoulder of another woman*. I rarely see strong female friendships represented by male authors. It's usually the lone girl in a group of guys."

It took his female coworkers chronicling their experiences to get him to realize I had done the best thing in that scenario. One of his coworkers was at the mall with earbuds in (to discourage being approached) and when a guy started harassing her, she tried to ignore him but he got aggressive and started grabbing her and screaming.

"I'm 29, 5'2. I probably look like I'm late teens, early 20's. I don't typically wear makeup.

All the dudes I've met in my real actual life and online who just can't entertain the idea that different forms of contraception work for different women. No we should not just, ""make all teenage girls start taking the pill"".

"When I was very young, my little sister and I had bunk beds. I slept in the top bunk, and she in the bottom. One night I suddenly woke up, leaned over the rail, and heard myself say, ""Lily, get out of the bed NOW."" My little sister objected sleepily but I just kept saying it. As soon as she got out of the bottom bunk, the bunk bed collapsed. "
Kinda prejudiced about people who have kids young like before they're 25. Like if I find out you had a kid at 21 I'm automatically going to judge you. sorry
"It wasn't actively bad, but goodness did it highlight what I didn't want.

The bride was keen on a big wedding, so invited a ton of remote friends. I had never met her (or her husband) before. My BF had been friends with her in high school, but hadn't seen her since.

All the speeches meant nothing to us. The wedding didn't mean much to us. The bride walked around the room to thank her guests, and half of the conversations were her introducing herself.

To me personally that was just not how I would want it. And we agreed that for our wedding every guest would, as a minimum, be someone we both had met."
Running late. If I'm not at least a few minutes early I tend to get irrationally anxious. 
"I went to ER because I was having horrific abdominal pain. I was 9 weeks pregnant and the ER dr told me it was just morning sickness. I told him my pain was an 8 and I kept nearly passing out from low blood pressure, but he dismissed what I said. Hours later he finally checked me, gave me the most painful pelvic exam I've ever had and ordered an ultrasound. Turns out my pregnancy was ectopic, had ruptured, and had been bleeding internally for hours and hours. I had bled a liter of blood into my abdomen by the time I was rushed into surgery.

Eta: the Dr who performed my surgery, and saved my life, was also a man. He took my pain very seriously and even spent an extra hour and a half in surgery trying to piece back to together my shattered tube to give me the best chance at fertility. This man not only saved my life, he changed it. I conceived my son two months later from the side my damaged tube was on. The majority of medical staff I've encountered have been great, regardless of gender. But I still know I almost died because a male Dr dismissed my internal bleeding as being nauseous. "
"Emotional affair.

A friend of his confessed to him. I didn't care because I knew he liked me, so there was no threat. However, they spent spring break together 2 years ago and I got this very...suspicious feeling going on. I ignored it at first, but then something really set me off where I tried to corner him during a phone call. He made me feel like I was being crazy and I dropped it, decided to trust him. Two weeks later he came clean and told me he was being too intimate with the girl during spring break (no sex or kissing or anything, but cuddling and flirtatious touching). It was a combination of not wanting to lose one of his closest friends, feeling somewhat pressured to provide something for her, and also being stressed out about expectations arising in our relationship. It wasn't until he realized that he was basically leading his friend on that he allowed himself to acknowledge what he was doing to me. Their friendship went south fast and they haven't spoken since.

He confessed while we were playing Life is Strange. We make jokes now about how the peaceful menu music of the game is associated with such a traumatic event haha.

Anyway, we worked through the issues but I was very self-conscious for a while. It didn't help that I felt the girl was prettier than me. She and another girl who was trying to be intimate with him while we were just FWBs are both of a demographic that made me very self-conscious about race-related issues, so that didn't help a complex I had since childhood at ALL. I was also very angry and accusatory of him for 4 months. It was a very difficult time. I don't think too much about it now, it's all in the past. We have a great relationship now and I've never felt more safe and loved than I do now. However, on the rare occasion, when I'm reminded I get upset on how I allowed him to hurt me like that. "
"Please get him and yourself a therapist. If you're not actively moving forward you're only hurting  yourself.

"I mean, you can totally get BV if you have a bunch of anal sex then don't rinse off before vaginal sex (source: my poor vagina). Still nothing to feel sorry for my girlfriend about and nothing that soap in orifices will fix. TwoX is basically a cesspool of shit anytime I say anything.

Rant away impotent rage BV guy, rant away :P"
"Whoopi Goldberg supported roman polanski and said it wasn't ""rape rape"". 


I have cancelled her in my book if celebrities that I really liked. Thanks whoopi. I was rooting for you. "

"The labia surgery thing seems like it is insanely rare at least.  I've met a small handful of women who are self-conscious about the way their pussy looks, but none of them are so crazy to actually get it surgically altered.

This might have something to do with the fact that you're permanently damaging your ability to derive pleasure from sex though.  If that weren't a consequence, maybe more women would."
"Are you trying to imply that there's more to us than our soft, supple, perky, bouncy, lively, tender, large, ravenous, sandbags of boobs?! "
It's like a Final Fantasy character designer found out that bras exist. 
Apparently nothing. I don't even remember the last time I received a compliment.

"That I was sleeping with my English teacher in high school when I absolutely wasn't.

Three years after graduation, I totally did."
"He was probably addicted to porn if he used to watch it even a fair amount. If you expose yourself to hyper-stimulus enough, that level of stimulus becomes normal and you can *need* it to get the normal response. I can't imagine he didn't also feel bad about it. "
"When my husband's urologist says he should have fifteen ejaculations this month and his response is to groan in preemptive defeat.  To be fair though it's hard to find time/energy with kids, jobs, hobbies, etc...  but 3-4x a week doesn't seem like that much, either :-("
"Not married yet, but I won't be taking his name. 



I see no reason why I would want to or what purpose it would serve for us. 


And I'm known professionally by my name, in an industry that is 90% based on networking, familiarity, and reputation. Changing my name would confuse that. 


I also love my name and love my family. I'm happy to have my name.



I can't see any circumstance in which I would regret it."
There is a woman at work who never hugs or gets on the floor to play with her dogs and I irrationally hate her for it.
I was really confused how this could happen at first until I remembered American schoolkids don't wear uniforms. 
Last week I was walking on the sidewalk with my mom... when she slipped on a banana peel. 
Here's my [moissanite engagement ring](http://imgur.com/a/HS7Mf) from Rosado's Box on Etsy! It's a 7mm moissanite with tiny white sapphires on the band. Completely diamond free! We got engaged in January :)

"Also, can we please also note how many female characters in Stephen King books have period blood running down their leg? When does that happen to regular adult women? Have I started my period when I wasn't prepared? Certainly! Has it EVER gotten to the point that it ran down my leg? Not once."
"Extreme difficulty orgasming. Last year a guy I loved brought it up as we were breaking up. To be fair, the bigger issue was I don't want kids and he does, but the fact that he brought it up as an issue with staying together still hurts.  I was able to get off twice with my last fwb over the course of 8 months. To his credit he always tried to do what he could, but I still feel like a failure. "
"Going down stairs? Delicately? In high heels?

If this is possible, it's not something I've ever mastered. Me going down stairs in heels always turns into CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP noises loud enough to wake the dead."
"He laughs in his sleep. He's really easy to sleep next to, doesn't snore, doesn't fidget. But he has this creepy, maniacal chuckle that only comes out while he's sleeping. "
