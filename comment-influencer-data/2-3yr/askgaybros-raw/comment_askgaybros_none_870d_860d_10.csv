0,Yea but it's different this time! He readjusted his dick in front of me while we were talking in the locker room after gym. I mean come on that's gotta be a sign that he wants me to suck him off! /s
1,"I had to write an essay in my upper-level college Spanish class, and the essay was on the subject of ""Mi Futuro Esposo/Esposa"" (My Future Spouse). I wrote all about my ideal husband and what I would do with him, what his job would be, etc.

When I got my paper back, my instructor had highlighted all of the parts where I used ""esposo"" instead of ""esposa."" Then, using my essay as an example, she told the class how we should always remember to use the correct masculine or feminine endings to words. I spoke up when she was done and told her I meant what I wrote, and then it finally dawned on her that I was gay. And then it dawned on me that I had just outed myself to my whole class. "
2,"In college I became friends with this one girl in a writing workshop I was taking. We wrote similar things, and would meet for lunch to go over each other's work and offer feedback and criticism. 

Her boyfriend thought I was trying to steal his girlfriend away from him and confronted me about it one day. I'm pretty obviously gay....I guess the rainbow bracelet and the fact I was *holding hands with MY boyfriend* at the time didn't clue him in."
3," I was 21, (50 year old bi guy), was picked up by a guy at a club, went to his hotel like three blocks away. This was about 6:00 on a Friday night. After we were done, he was like ""Hey, I have to be up really early in the morning."" I was like, cool- ok if I take a shower?"" So, it's only 9:30, I go back to the club, meet another guy, we go to the same hotel. I sleep over, and he gets up at like 5:30 the next morning, and says we have time for a quick breakfast. He dresses in the uniform of an airline flight crew. We go down to the coffee shop, and the first guy is already there, wearing cabin crew uniform. They're like ""Morning, Joe"", ""Morning, Bob"". I just chatted with them, then made the stride of pride back to my car."
4,Anytime a woman is trying to flirt with me to get something. 
5,"Oh the guy came sauntering up in that ""I don't want to look like a tough guy but I want you to know I mean business"" kind of way, looks at me and says ""So what's this I hear about you trying to move in on my girl?""

I was kind of taken aback and said ""Where did you get that impression?"" He told me that one of his friends told him that I ""had been getting pretty friendly with his girl lately and it looked suspicious"" and his friend pointed me out to him. 

I kind of laughed, looked at my boyfriend. I wanted to say something catty and witty in response, but like I said, I was a little taken off guard at being accused in the first place, so all I ended up saying was ""I think you've made a major misunderstanding. I'm gay and this is my boyfriend Dan. Your girlfriend and I are just friends who take the same writing class. I have zero interest in her that way, relax."" 

It then started to dawn on him, and to his credit he looked pretty mortified. He mumbled out an apology and left me alone after that. "
6,I gave my first blowjob before I got my first kiss. College is a strange time. 
7,"Yeah! It's pretty much why I don't ask guys out outside of apps. In apps I know guys are there for hookups or dating, in social environments you have no idea."
8,"""You have no power here."" "
9,"Gurl we get it, you got lucky and found a nearly straight top. "
10,You know how you avoid this dilemma? By having a face picture to begin with.
11,"One time I had consensual intercourse with my then boyfriend in the missionary position with the lights off.

Please be nice .__."
12,"*Fast forwards 24 hrs*

""I know he's straight, but I think he might be into me"" "
13,"Coworker I wasn't very close with but had been working with for a few months asked me something about my wife. I told him I didn't have a wife, and he then assumed that my wife must have died, because I wear a wedding ring.

I don't blame him at all for his confusion, this was before they legalized gay marriage here in the US (husband and I got married in Amsterdam) but it was still very awkward especially because he was a super conservative and very religious guy. His eyes were the size of saucers when it finally clicked that he was talking to a gay dude who had a *husband.*

Edit: Oh I'm sorry, I didn't mean to leave you all hanging! I'm afraid there's no funny ending to this one, he just said something like ""oh... you don't look gay to me"" and excused himself. He continued to be very polite to me, but he never really tried to start a conversation again after that unless it was about work, and he was pretty uncomfortable when we were alone in the elevator. Never heard from him again after I quit that job."
14,"....Have sex with 27 different men in one weekend. 

Judge me like Judy. "
15,"When my ex's parents came to visit us in California. My ex was not out to his parents (we had been together at that time for over 7 years) so I was left with the very uncomfortable tour of our new house with his dad. It was a 4 bedroom house, one bedroom was an office for me, the other an office for my ex, the third was setup as a guest room with two twin beds and of course the master suite. His dad asked me ""where is your bedroom?"" and I pointed at the master suite and he said ""so where does (my ex) sleep?"" and I said ""in the master bedroom"". Then it hit me... I just outed us..... The look of confusion was very awkward. Then he starts mumbling ""so (my ex) and you....."" ""are""..... ""uh"".... ""where is the bathroom?"""
16,Every persons face who made a post regarding this issue. ( ͡ಠ ͜ʖ ͡ಠ)
17,"Oh god. My sisters 21st. I knew I was gay, but I was absolutely terrified so I wasn't out to anyone. I was pretty awkward, and didn't know anyone, and couldn't hang around my sister all night because obviously all the attention was on her. 

So I ended hanging out with one of her friends all night - a former ugly duckling with self esteem issues and fresh out of a bitter breakup. We chatted all night, danced together and just generally had a lot of fun. But towards the end of the night she sort of started trying to put the moves on me, and it got really awkward and I pretended I needed the bathroom to get away, and sort of moved us off the dance floor when I got back and onto the corner of the bar where she was quite far away from me. We had the same lift home, during which she sat next to me, held my hand and rested her head on my shoulder.

During most of the times she was close enough to kiss me, I was mortified at the thought of my first kiss being with a girl - ever since I'd come out to myself I'd constructed a whole big gay romance novel of expectations in my head, and a girl being my first kiss didn't fit with that.

The thing that I find more upsetting now, out of sympathy, is that her bitter breakup - which provided a large amount of conversation fodder, because she was pretty damn bitter - is that she'd broken up with her boyfriend because he was - and I quote - ""fucking dudes in the ass"". Poor girl. She had some really crappy gaydar."
18,"I work as a server for a restaurant to make some extra cash. Since the restaurant is in the fashion district, there are a lot of gay men that stop by for lunch. When I see I got a table with a gay dude, I turn up the gay charm to 100%. I once got a 100$ tip from a table with a gay dad and his daughter. Best day ever. "
19,"Considering the part of the US I live in, if I asked the wrong guy I'd probably get my ass kicked, or worse. Midwest if you're curious."
20,"There's been a handful of times here and there at straight bars where the girl wants me to buy her drinks or a girl wants to cheat off my test in school. The one that sticks out the most to me was in my Jr year in college when I had a group project with 2 really attractive girls. You could just tell these girls are used to always getting what they want from men. On the first day we broke up into our group to review what parts we were going to cover they both started flirting with me. Saying things like, ""we should totally all go out tonight"" ""So do you have a girlfriend?"" All while touching my arm and leg here and there and playing with their hair. Then the conversation of who does what came up. They both were making excuses how they're so so so busy and it would be amazing if I could do a majority of it. At this point I just flat out said, ""nah I'm busy too. I have plans to take my boyfriend out this weekend."" The both kind of froze for a second unsure of the next move. We got a B-."

22,"Something my husband does every night - he goes to bed before me and is sound asleep within minutes. about an hour or two later I head to bed and as soon as I climb in, he rolls over and immediately spoons me and wraps his arms around my chest and pulls me into him. Then falls back asleep holding me. I am in heaven every night. "
23,I would strongly suspect that for sure.
24,Was in the gym doing squats and a girl started squatting next to me and was chatting me up clearly hitting on me. She finally asked if I wanted to go out some time. I told her I appreciated it but that I was sorry she really wasn't my type and that I was gay.  She got all pissed called me a liar and told me if I thought she was ugly I coulda at least came up with a better lie. lol I finally pulled up a picture of me kissing my boyfriend and she just walked off lol

33,"She has issues and even if you were straight, you would've just dodged a bullet."
34,"When my boyfriend and I (both early 20s) go out on dinner dates, sometimes older gay couples will see us and buy us a round of drinks. Seeing the younger generations being able to be out and proud definitely makes a lot of the older gay population feel warm and fuzzy. 

No one really cares if they see a young straight couple together in public."

40,"First of all don't panic. 

Your staying with your friend, so your safe for now. Ask him if it would be OK to crash till after your exam, so you don't lose this semester.

like u/yeasayerstr said, look up some resource centers with your college or city. Maybe you can get some information from the national youth line or sth.
In bigger cities there are generally youth centers, that are maintained by youth workers, they can refer you to the people you need to talk to.

And the last advice to calm you down, if the british government is at least a bit similar to the german and i highly think so, your parents CAN'T just kick you out while you're a minor without paying you some money for rent/food etc. So if it comes to this go to the police, they will at least point you in the right direction."
41,I think you handled this great! Good job OP!
42,"I became a bitch boy for two friends of my fiance, which I see on daily basis. I let them treat me like shit in my own house, I took their loads with all my holes and then I said the most respectful ""thank you, sir!"" in my whole life...

52,"I was so sure that you actively wanted people to think you were gay that my jaw dropped when I read *""my heterosexuality""*

53,I was 18 and went to console one of of my female friends who just got dumped by a boy I had a crush on. She thought I hung out with them and acted sorta a third wheel puppy dog because I was crushing on her. She wanted to let me know she was available and liked me. I had to tell her it was because I had a stupid gay crush on her boyfriend. She never talked to me again.
54,"I believe you are well thought-out about not wanting to scare potential date or making them pressure into going to dates out of pity. I would confide in that person once you know him quite enough such that you two are comfortable in discussing deep personal issue. That might come in weeks or month, pending how frequent you two see each other. 

I recently lost someone dear to my heart by untreatable cancer. I wish you well and take good care of yourself man!"
55,Comfortable with your HETEROSEXUALITY. Well with that tattoo you better get comfortable with your homosexualitity. 
56,"So, fun insider fashion packaging picture information: Men generally have much better legs in terms of shape and definition than women, so most of the pictures on stockings (pantyhose) packages are actually shaved men's legs. Likewise with most legs where you can't see past the hip. 

My mom was in advertising, and always found it hilarious. Like, men's legs at the average level often seem like a really good pair of women's legs - so sometimes they don't even use a model - just grab the nearest employee with nice legs, make him shave (if he has to) and boom. Lady legs once you crop the photo. 

Society (aka pantyhose manufacturers) has conditioned you to be into shaved dude legs. 😂😂😂"
57,24 hours? You're awfully optimistic.
58,"man, you must be hot, i NEVER have guys looking at me like that #feelsbadman"
59,You handled that much better than I would have. I would have gone right for the catty comment.
60,"I'm a guy who would probably be considered fem, and I really don't care one way or another if another guy prefers masculine guys over fem guys or vice-versa. People are allowed to have their preferences in whom they find attractive. Not every gay guy on the planet is obligated to find you desirable. I don't mean to sound blunt, but the level of narcissism that goes on with some gay men is staggering. He's not into fem guys? Oh well, move on and look for a guy who doesn't care. Remember that no matter if you're fem, masc, a bear, otter or whatever label you chose to identify as, there is someone out there who is into that aspect of who you are and finds it attractive, one guy's opinions doesn't speak for the entirety of the gay community. "
61,"Balance is good. 
Moderation in all things is good, including moderation. 
But the balance you seek is that of the ""traditional"" life you're talking about. There's nothing wrong with that. It's what you want, it's not hurting anyone. And who gives a fuck what your parents think about your relationship... No offence but unless he's gay, he's reading from the wrong play book. Try turning the question on its ear. If you were the dominant and cleaned the house, made dinner and make him comfortable would that be any more balanced? I don't know how old you two are, but I'd be willing to be this is something that works itself out. But if it's not a problem for you, keep going. You enjoy being submissive. That brings you pleasure. You enjoy being good to him. Enjoy it. I personally would ask my parents and friends to keep their comments about my relationship to themselves. There's a line and they're crossing it because it's disturbing your love, your happiness, your bliss. I'm sure there's a polite way of putting it to them but in the end it's your happiness. Be happy"
62,"One of the more serious posts of AGB.

Don't be surprised if guys bolt, as your situation is a lot to process. But I guess you know that.  You're frankly at a different stage of life. 

Be patient when the inevitable questions and annoying encouragement comes.  I doubt you are keen on having medical journals and alternative therapies e-mailed/mentioned to you. That was a kind of torment foisted on my late mother.

Should you ever pass through Honolulu/Hawaii, hit me up.   

"
63,Shoot napalm at me.
64,"Here's my two cents. My parents weren't rich when I was growing up but they were middle class. My dad made about $80K and my mom made like $24K or something. Anyway, dad had the idea that she should ""pitch in her share"" and they argued all the time bc it just never worked out. 

My thing is, if you can afford to cover all the major bills and you know the person you're with can't, there's no shame in letting that person save the little money they have and just maybe buying groceries or paying for outings or something small like that. 

You know he can't afford to live with you. But you seem to love him anyway and it's not like you need his help. As long as you trust him, why make him stress about money that you don't really need just because of some imaginary principles about how bills are supposed to be shared? In the end, it's not worth losing someone over. A genuine connection is rare. No need to create issues where there needn't be any. "
65,"Ok I understand why you're embarrassed and if I were in your shoes I'd tell him to chill out. Not because he's acting gay, but because announcing that you're gay to the people you're being introduced to is so inappropriate. And your sex life is something that people are not comfortable hearing about.
That said, I don't want to sound like a researcher or anything but I've noticed that closeted young men tend to go through an ultra-gay phase after coming out. I think he'll naturally tone it down after a while so stick around for that."
66,"I've never been to jail or prison... but my boyfriend has been in a federal low for the last 6 years, so I get to hear quite a few of the stories.

First of all... at least in a low security federal prison, there is almost no rape or non-consensual sex.  Sex with willing partners is pretty freely available.. and the penalties for catching a sex assault charge are serious enough that nobody is stupid enough to risk it.  It is a guaranteed trip to a MUCH higher security prison, and a much longer prison sentence.   In 6+ years, he has only heard of ONE guy being forcibly raped... and that was a ""punishment"" for an unpaid gambling debt.

That's not to say that it is completely safe.  There are a LOT of predators in prison who will take advantage of the new guys.  But it's usually more of a guilt trip or coercion thing, rather than a physical assault.

My bf and I have an agreement on what he can and can't do (oral only, no anal) while he is there.   He gets semi-regular blowjobs (probably more often than he tells me about), but there are very few men there that he finds attractive, so he doesn't get in to anything regular.   He doesn't like the drama that comes with it.  Prison inmates are pretty much just like a bunch of junior high school girls.

You would be surprised at how many of the guys in prison are having sex.  It is easily the majority of them.  ""Prison Gay"" and ""Gay for the Stay"" are definitely a thing.  Guys who would never let another guy near them on the outside are more than happy to get a little action from a guy after they've been alone for a few months.  And not always just a quick, un-reciprocated blow job.  A lot of ""straight"" guys are in full blown relationships, with cuddling and the whole 9 yards.

One of our favorite things to do during visitation, is for him to fill me in on all of the other guys there at visitation, who are there with their wives/girlfriends, and all their kids.  ""That is Bob... he's sleeping with Mike.  That is Joe... he's dating Charlie...  he says he is leaving his wife to be together when he gets out, but he needs his wife to keep sending him money"", etc.

It seems that the majority of the sex is oral.  It is easier to find a spot to get a quick blow job than it is to find the privacy you need for fucking.   Technically, any kind of sexual contact can be a pretty big deal if you get caught (inmates can't legally consent to sex, so both partners can and do get charged with rape), but for the most part, staff looks the other way, or doesn't file an official shot/charge, unless they are a real asshole, or you've done something to piss them off.

There are definitely guys who go wild while they are in prison.  One of the bf's friends (before he got transferred) had a whole squad of regulars that he was blowing.  On any given night, he would be giving head to 4 to 8 guys."
67,So one fight and he's ready to break up with you after 3 years? You're leaving something out.

If you get caught in certain parts of the US, you can easily be registered as a sex offender, have a license or some sort revoked (e.g. gov't clearance), and pay massive fines.

There really wasn't much to discuss. Mathematically she couldn't pass the class and no amount of pleading or negotiation would change this fact. 

At some point I realize she was unbuttoning her shirt, very slowly. She was saying, ""Are you sure there isn't a thing I can do?"" I maintained eye contact and said, ""No. Nothing."" 

I sensed this flash of confusion cross her face, like she couldn't understand why her approach wasn't working. It occurred to me that this tactic must've worked in the past. After a brief awkward silence, she very very casually rebuttoned, gathered her things, excused herself, and left. "

-  Women will have a much tougher road in pulling the ""But I'm a girl!"" card on us.  Us gay guys can easily call you out on any bullshit you pull with straight guys and have little to zero qualms on how you react.


-  Straights have to deal with accidental pregnancies.  We don't even though we keep trying over and over again.


-  Straight guys usually open up their more sensitive feelings around gay guys than women since there's no sense of machismo to be played.  Gender roles are thrown out.


-  Like a kink as a gay guy?  Normal.  Like a kink as a straight guy/girl?  You are weird and need therapy.


-  Don't want children?  No one blinks an eye.  A straight couple don't want children?  Society questions your choice and will guilt you in having them.  


-  Want to remain single?  Common among gay men.  Want to remain single as a straight guy?  You are viewed as immature, a pedophile, or gay.  Want to remain single as a straight woman?  Crazy cat lady for you.


-  Gays can choose any career without be harassed by their choice.  Be an engineer?  No problem.  Banker?  No problem.  Be a nanny?  Fine by me.  Want to be a dessert chef?  Not even a blink.  For a straight guy, it is different.  Be an engineer?  Sure.  Banker?  No problem.  Nanny?  WTF, why do you want hang out with children?  Chef?  Homo.

97,"Oh, I have another one. I once sat down at lunch with 2 guys from my research lab in uni who were midway through a discussion about prohibitions against stuff in the bible. They'd just landed on how ridiculous the one guy (the atheist, who'd actually been the first person I'd come out to in the lab) thought prohibitions against homosexuality were - outmoded, ridiculous and interpreted to freely by Christians who were excessively homophobic.

The other guy, a Christian, spouted off the regular claptrap, which I'm pretty good at shutting down, and the atheist and I had a lot of fun shredding his rhetoric. He was talking quite freely about this, which was pretty weird, since I was pretty openly out among the people in the lab, and he is usually the definition of timid and non confrontational. So it seemed strange to both of us that he was spouting some really homophobic things right in front of me.

But then something came up where a point in his argument was that gay sex somehow wasn't enjoyable. And my response was something like. ""Trust me, it's enjoyable. If it wasn't I wouldn't do it."" And he got incredibly awkward after that. I was done with lunch by that point, so I moved on, but apparently the conversation moved on between the two of them and the atheist later told me he had somehow been the one person in the lab who never noticed I was gay. He later apologized, and is still super extra timid around me these days."

You know exactly how young gay guys life looks like - they are always hiding a secret about themselves, they often don't have anyone to talk about this. Sure, they are dealing with the same problems over and over again, but they need someone to talk about this and they need YOU to listen, to tap their shoulder and say that everything is going to be fine.

World is often very unfriendly for us, so why aren't WE supportive for each other, at least?

103,I call that a sticky seven. 
104,"Ah, so you did half a golden week? It's called a golden week if you do it 7 days in a row. "

107,This is actually better. Makes you look like the bigger man.
108,"He's delusional. I don't think he's a bad person, he probably does care for you, but:

&gt;""But you also know I'm not gay. I mean, if I were, I'd probably marry you or something, but I'm not.""

WHUT.


&gt;""I'm not gay because I don't like guys and I only sleep with girls.""

DOUBLE WHUT

That makes NO SENSE AT ALL (unless you cross dress and are mega fem, or trans, which from your description you aren't)

Like, this defies logic. He defied logic. He needs to see a psych.

109,A wild  weekend on my toilet can cause my ass to hurt a little
110,"I don't believe it will ever happen, to be honest. Not as long as we continue to call ourselves ""gay"" as a differentiating feature. There's obviously been a lot of acceptance and progress over the decades, but I suspect that it will always be viewed as ""different"" because it does not fulfill the biological purpose of reproduction."
111,I have to admit that I don't like drama in my life but love vicariously experiencing other people's drama. 
112,"I was at a bar drunk off my ass and someone gave me a couple tokes of some really good weed (big mistake, never smoke pot AFTER you drink) and within 30 minutes I was violently puking my brains out all over the place. This guy who was cruising me was all over me holding me as I was puking and was trying to give me his number while I was still, puking... Telling me how cute i was and how he wanted to date me, suck my cock and get fucked by me... I was so sick my friend had to drive me home and even getting into the car, he was still all over me when my friend told him to go fuck off and get a life... LOL. "

116,I like some straight porn. Its just lesbian porn that's a deadzone for me.
117,"When I first came out to anyone, my good friend/roommate was yelling at me over his perception that I was ""stealing the ladies"" at the bar we were at. I got so annoyed I just spat out - a bit drunkenly - that ""I am not trying to steal the ladies... I have a boyfriend!"" "

119,"I can't speak to Tinder, but in general I have much better luck with men.

"
120,"He was supportive and told me he loves me. My mom was in the same room. When she asked me, ""how do you know you're gay?,"" (I was 17 at the time) my dad said, ""[her name], he knows."""
121,"*""I... honestly thought that your brother was the gay one.""*"
122,He has the higher sex drive. We'll be watching something and suddenly he is on my lap and I am hard. It's a bit gross but we started putting the condoms and the lube in between the couch spaces. This is also why we never have guests over anymore
123,"Eh, it's not really hard. All I have to do is sit on his lap and ask for a hug. One minute later I can ^usually feel his boner getting ready to action... (˵ˆꇴˆ˵ )

Sometimes I like to do something special tho, like handcuff myself and go to him to ask ""can you give me the key, sir?"" with a very sad, helpless face. When I tried it last time, I had to pay for the key with both holes... Can't really complain. (ˆ⌣ˆ )"
124,Everything you own in a box to the left...

143,A different guy for each waking hour of the day for two days? How in the hell...
144,"Hmm... The last time that happened I was at a Death Grips concert, mid set, and decided to get some water from the bar so I didn't pass out from dehydration (Webster Hall gets very hot). So I'm standing there sipping on water when I feel somebody full-palm grab my left ass cheek and squeeze hard. It actually kinda startled me, and then I saw it was a (very) drunk chick. I politely indicated I was not interested and had a boyfriend, only for her to repeatedly grab and grope me. Finally I got fed up and shoved her as hard as I could into a big group of people moshing. Last I saw of her. "
145,"It's honestly part of what puts me on edge sometimes. Did that guy look at me that way because he was into me? Or did I just catch his glance at the wrong time? And then as others have said, that mistake can turn out into a bad time..."
146,"I have a story thats kind of the exact opposite of the question asked.


So, one time I was picking a pizza up at  a local pizza place.   I don't frequent the place, so I didnt know the staff.

So, this cute twink is waiting on me.  kind of rough(major weakness for those rough boys), tattoos on his arms, short blond hair cutest little smile.

So, i'm kind of dressed nice, good cologne i figure what the hell, throw some woo at him see what sticks.

Immediatly goes for it, flirts back and forth while i wait for the pizza to cook.  At the end I asked for his number.

He smiles grabs a slip of order paper and writes out the number and details.

I go back out to the car sit down and unfold my new prize.

It was signed Becky, with a heart smiley face a the end.

Asked a friend who went there, it was the owners daughter.  She wasn't a twink she was a tomboy.


Had a similar experience with a lesbian that looked exactly like young M and M.  luckily that was even funnier. 

I flirted, she said i'm gay, and I just nodded happily, that I assumed so.. then she had to explain she was a woman.


I'm really batting 1000..."
147,"If you wanted someone to like you, using sex is not a great way to win someone over in the long term.  You can't use hookup tactics as bait for feelings.


If you want to pursue hookups, you have to separate lust from admiration.  It has to be treated as business like.  You have to make terms, negotiate, and be ethical while being smart with your decisions because every choice will have risks in one form or another.


Mind you, hook ups are not for everyone and relationships are also not for everyone.  My impression is that you dove in head first without considering the consequences.  Chalk this as a lesson learn and determine what you like and didn't like.  Identify the mistakes and if you do pursue this, make sure you don't repeat them.  You can't change your past actions but you can control future actions and reactions."
148,Personality. Looks fade away with time. And you can't really build something long term with someone who might be attractive but has the personality of a brick wall. 
149,"As someone that can relate to your boyfriend well, I am pretty much in tears reading this.  It was so hard for him to share, but seeing it from my perspective having been through what I have...this is so beautiful.  It's a big step in healing for him to share that with you, and please take it from me--please treasure the vulnerability that he showed you.  It's huge."
150,"Merit is definitely the most important thing, but it's not the *only* important thing. There are many factors that influence a company's decision to hire you - being the best in one category isn't enough by itself. 

When comparing candidates that are actually qualified for the position, you may notice that the differences between them is small. Let's say person A is fully competent at 95% of what the job entails. Maybe person B is only competent at 85% of the position, but is more organized and better at communicating with coworkers/clients. Maybe person B is also more willing to travel for business trips or attend seminars. In this sort of situation person B would be a bigger asset to the company overall, even if they have leas experience and would require more training. 

Companies value diversity because it brings outside experiences and viewpoints to the table. Not just in the workplace itself, but in conducting actual business. A gay man will likely be better at advertising a product and expanding the company's market to the LGBT community than a straight man, for example. Even if the gay guy is less experienced, these sorts of things would make the company value him more."

153,Are you sure he was checking you out?  Maybe he was just giving you the stink eye for fucking his son?
154,The struggle is real. 
155,"yeah, it can get tricky at times. there are, of course, ways of gauging a guy's orientation subtly and minimizing the risk of an adverse reaction of the subject. it's an advanced course in gay school; gaydar 101 is a prerequisite"
156,"I think my experience was really close to yours. My best friend is this really smart, funny, truly gorgeous woman. When we were in high school, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a crush on me (which was strange since I was kinda schlubby), and eventually convinced myself that of course, since I loved spending time with her, and she was a beautiful woman, and I was, of course, a straight high schooler, I would/should date her. 

It wasn't bad. We'd go hang out at the park, or spend hours talking at a coffee shop, etc. For, like, two years. I enjoyed spending time with her! And, because we went to a Catholic school and I was pretty religious (previously considered being a monk), I was ""saving myself for marriage."" We'd make out sometimes, and I'd be thinking about which route I'd take home or what I should write for that essay, and then we'd drive away, no hanky panky necessary. 

Of course, by the time I realized it was all a charade and I was gay, the guilt of stringing her along started weighing on me. But by that time we'd graduated high school, and we tried for about a month to make long distance work in college. Then one night we were on the phone. 

Me: I need to tell you something

Her: me too

Me: you first

Her: I love you but... [blah blah blah] I want to start seeing this other guy

Me: cool, I love you but I'm gay

Sometimes things work out on their own"
157,"I had one as a TA. One of my female students hadn't been doing the work in the lab. One day, she was wearing a halter top at her lab bench. She called me over for a question and she leaned over the bench and squeezed her chest to make her mangos ""pop."" ""Is there *anything* else I could do?"" I blinked at her without looking down and then proceed to cover the principles of error propagation in her data."
158,"No offence OP, but your mom's a dick. I know she was indoctrinated to believe all this garbage, by the church and her parents and society, but still. You don't deserve to be treated like this.

At this point it's kind of ""the hard way or the hard way"". Either you go back into the closet to shut her up and try to live your life as best you can till you can move out. Or you go through the emotionally taxing process of constantly feeding her scientific proof that refutes all the bullshit she believes until she at least tolerates you.

I went with the second option when this happened to me, it mostly worked, but if I could have moved out sooner I would have.

Good luck OP."
159,"I am amazed that no one is eviscerating you on the gross social irresponsibility of two tops basically taking themselves off the market.  I mean, how many bottoms go thirsty as a result of this pairing? 10? 20?

"
167,"I can't imagine how many straight men manage to settle down these days. A lot of the women I know both think the man should pay on every date, but would find it sexist if they had the door held for them; they want a man who's always taking the initiative, but they also find it oppressive if a guy makes a decision they don't agree with. They can't stand how ""unrealistic"" it is for a man to find thin women attractive, but how many women do you know that would date a guy under 5'8""?

So, I agree. I had a few girlfriends as a teenager, and while that was a long time ago, I was always appalled at how much they expected versus the men I've dated. I've never had a guy get pissed at me because I didn't give him flowers or a card for Valentine's Day, or get pissed because I forgot his birthday was coming up. And none of the guys I've ever dated expected me to pay for dinner every time we went out."

170,"One of the points I try to make in this subreddit is to take answers seriously because you are absolutely right that there are younger folks who need to vent or ask questions.  My problem though is when I give out a thorough answer that they might not like to hear or goes against their own justification of their actions, it is responded with attitude, emojies, and pettiness.  I take the time to collect my thoughts to make quality posts and I expect the same level of respect in return.  When I see 😂 or ""boi"" or ""bussy"" or some stupid gay sass that forces me to lower my intelligence level to meet your cunt level of attitude, I stop giving a damn about your problem anymore.  That is my problem with the younger gay posters here.  "

175,"Yeah me too. I just wanna have generic cuddly missionary sex, and then fall asleep in my boyfriend's arms. Of course that requires me to get a boyfriend first but still."
176,"PSA's are honestly pointless, because the majority of the posters are trolls or don't bother reading posts that were submitted not even a few hours earlier.  Maybe a quarter of us here actually look at past posts or submit legitimate questions."
177,"You're not ""back in the closet"" just because she's in denial.  Because saying you're ""back in the closet"" takes the responsibility off of her to accept that you're gay and puts the onus on you to repeat information that should've already registered  to her ""when she's in a better mood"" or something.  You came out to her.  You are out.  Don't worry about bringing the subject up to her again.  It's her responsibility to accept your gayness, its not your responsibility to make her."
178,"I just gave head for the first time yesterday and his dick didn't really taste like anything to me, unless I'm crazy and don't remember. Maybe your boyfriend needs to reevaluate his hygiene habits? ._. "

188,"I went to this party in Brooklyn (huge party, aerial dancers, stages to dance on, that kind of thing), and I'm a little buzzed and rolling on molly. It was ""House Bunny"" themed, so I'm up on a stage dancing wearing shiny rainbow trunks, a mesh t-shirt, bunny ears, and makeup--so clearly not interested in ladies, right?

There's only room for like 5 people on this stage, and I'm pretty sure the other guys on the stage are straight, so I go to dance with the girl. She *immediately* turns to me, says, ""this is my boyfriend,"" and reaches down to touch some jacked guy in the crowd (I assume this is some defense mechanism against straight dudes). I looked at her like ""bitch, please"" turned to him with a dazzling smile and told him how nice it was to meet him. He looked hella confused and I turned around and danced by myself.

Then, of course, there's all the times straight guys go on about how much they want to bang girls. Some guy at work: ""Man, some females.

204,"I'm pretty much always on your guy's side of this equation in relationships, dunno how else to word this without getting agb roasted for sounding humblebraggy but fuck it.  

I always make sure to let him know in small ways here and there that it's just money and it doesn't matter, which is honestly how I feel.  But I understand that he doesn't see it that way and it can be a hit to his pride if he's not able to provide on his part.  So I look at it as being my responsibility to be gentle and respectful with him about it and always assure him that it's a non-issue in very subtle ways.

I let him get things like movie tickets, booze, or groceries for us.  I'll get the expensive dinners, flights, hotels, whatever.  Works out fine, it's never caused any issues in any of my relationships.  One short acknowledgment of it at the start of the relationship is all it takes.  

To your second point, yes you will absolutely sabotage the relationship if you're constantly guarded because of this.  Have the convo during a nice intimate moment where you feel close to him, tell him how you feel, he'll tell you he understands and that it's ok.  Then move on and don't bring it up again."

You were wonderful in that you supported and did not press him when you asked why he would do that. This is clearly a problem your boyfriend has or did have.

However, this is not a total relationship ender, and I believe the two can work through any problem that comes your way. "

First guy was a friend who I had began a recent flirtation with. Around 10:00pm, we were hanging out, which turned into making out, and some light over the pants stuff.

Second guy was around 1:00am that night, another friend of mine who had just broken up with his boyfriend and told me he had been thinking about me, so we ended up exchanging head in the backseat of my car.

Third guy was around noon the next day, a random Grindr hookup in the hot tub at his apartment.

Fourth guy was that evening, my ex-boyfriend whom I had still been fooling around with.

Normally the odds of being gay are about 5%. But it has been found that if you're gay and have a twin, the odds of your twin also being gay jumps to 66%. So in the majority of cases, you'd be coming out to someone who is also gay.

Not sure, but think this only applies to identical twins. "
