0,"As an ugly guy who pursues guys physically out of his league, remember that you *never know* what someone else likes. He agreed to the date because there's something about you he finds compelling, just as you find him compelling. Also remember that dating someone like him is no different than any other date - there a a less than 1% chance of you two still being together in ten years, so set your expectations appropriately and don't be too distraught if you're not compatible, and don't let your insecurities take over if it goes nowhere. We all think we know why dates don't work out, but the narrative we spin in our head is usually much more about our own insecurities than the actual reasons the other person lost interest. 

Coming back around to the main idea, there's something about you he wants to explore, so don't go in with the mindset that he's doing you a favor. You asked him out, he agreed - you're in the driver's seat, so take the wheel.

With pretty guys, the first thing to determine is does he think he's pretty? Whether he is pretty or not is subjective and irrelevant. You'd be shocked at how many seriously hot guys either don't think they're hot or have crippling insecurities about their appearance. The third possibility is he doesn't think of his appearance at all. With which are you dealing?

Then remember that smart girls like to be told they're pretty and pretty girls like to be told they're smart. If he's confident about his appearance and all you do is fawn over his looks, you'll be just like every other guy he's dated and you won't be offering him anything compelling. Ask him questions to figure out what it is about you he finds interesting. Maybe he's just polite and will say yes to a date with anyone? 

And the other possibilty you haven't considered? The one that was hardest for me to accept as an ugly guy? Some insanely hot guys find me *really* attractive. My bald head and my furry body - they fucking love it. Something about me makes their dick hard and makes them want to fuck my dick off. I don't know what you look like, but maybe you're his jam?

Basically, get out of your own head and have a good time with measured expectations. "
1,No apologies. Period. Cut this person and anyone who enables his selfish childish behavior out of your life. Anyone who overlooks all those shallow things he does is not someone to call friend. 
2,"&gt;He sends me links from various websites and I almost feel like it's similar to Muslim radicalization propaganda/brainwashing.

That's because it is. Sane people don't think that way. They have to have their fears and uncertainties preyed upon to become radicalized assholes. "
3,"You could grow up and realize there's nothing wrong with being the bottom in the relationship. That's one option. Or, you could bring him home and show your parents some porn with twink topping a big, muscle bound jock. "
4,There's really not a better situation than right now to come out. 
5,Holy shit that's a lot to process 
6,"&gt; When I asked him why he just didn't tell me, he couldn't answer.

Kids lie when they don't have to.

&gt; I just feel like a massive creep for sleeping with him and kissing him

You're not though. You acted responsibly given the information you had.

&gt; What should I do?

Let him stay on your couch for a couple days until he can make arrangements... ~~but for legal reasons, you need to end that right now.~~*

*Apparently you're okay in MA."
7,"Do not tell anyone until he is ready himself,please.
No one wants that,its not on you if he should or shouldn't come out,let him prepare..."
8,I'd tell your parents. Might prevent them from being interviewed on CNN after your white-supremacist brother commits the next mass shooting.
9,"It is not legal for them to kick you out, although I can't imagine that home would be a good environment for you at this point. You could talk to a school counselor or teacher but they would likely have to report this to CPS. If you can stay with your friend or you have a relative to stay with that could buy you time while you find resources to help. 

Try http://www.glnh.org/ or  http://www.1800runaway.org/ to help find local resources."
10,That does sound kind of fucked up if you ask me. I'd be honest and respond that you are not ok with it. 
11,"It hasn't always been this way. The 1964 republican presidential candidate was Barry Goldwater, known as ""Mr Conservative,"" was a proponent of gay rights, he voted against the Civil Rights act because he thought it didn't go nearly far enough, and was quoted, ""Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the [Republican] party, and they're sure trying to do so, it's going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can't and won't compromise. I know, I've tried to deal with them."""
12,"People are allowed to not be attracted to femininity. ""Masculine"" gay dudes are not ""acting straight"". They are being themselves. Me being gay doesn't mean I HAVE TO like drag, make-up, ...I grew up in a different context and thus have a different personality. And not ALL masculine gay dudes are into other masculine guys.

I don't hate feminine (gay) guys. It's just that I don't see myself with one relationship-wise. No one is consuming anything. People just express their desires. Now if you want to waste your time sending a message and reading the answer of some gay dude telling you in a politically correct way he isn't into feminine guys, that's up to you. But I'd prefer to know from the get go that x-dude is not into me."
13,"I wear sunglasses a lot, so no one can see where I'm looking. üòè"
14,"Come the fuck out already, Jesus. "
15,"I always wonder when people say, ""let's say this peron's name is x"", if that's their actual name. Especially with names like Daxton and Mariah. If I wanted to make up names, I would use names like Bob, John, Mary etc. Just some unrelated shower thoughts."
16,"This one time we were having a high school trip that involved hiking on a hill, I slipped on the way down and this muscular middle-eastern, hunk of a pre-teen with wolverine like hair on his forearms caught me and said ""Watch out there"" 

Needless to say I was hyper-ventilating like a bitch."
17,You need a change of venue; seriously.
18,"So, a good straight friend a long time ago told me he didn't understand why, but he just didn't respond to black women with the same attraction as other women. Then years later, he gave me an update about something that surprisingly switched that for him.

He said that it happened over the course of six months or so. He worked with two black women that were just flirty with him in a playful way. Nothing inappropriate, they just gave that positive attention a person gives when they're being open and positive to you in a flirty way. He said something about that just started to flip a switch and he started to suddenly notice black women in the environment more when he was out and about. It's like his brain started to make a connection between those features and that good feeling that comes with attraction and people making us feel good.

So, just know that types and attraction are very plastic and can change a lot throughout our adult life. You don't have to force a change. Just being open to guys of other types and get to know them personally and you'll likely notice your type being less narrow."
19,"My roommates and a few other frat guys were all in my dorm playing drinking games.

I tried to stay out of their way all day, but I finally came back after being out all day.

They said I could join, it was half my dorm after all.

After some shots of vodka im fucking wasted. I didn't eat anything and I had zero tolerance.

After acting like a maniac this sexy jock was feeling guilty because he knew it was my first time drinking. So he would ""babysit"" me I guess. 

That same night the fire-alarm went off. We were outside and he told me I had to stand up straight and not act drunk or we could get arrested. So I was leaning my head into his pecs and listening to his encouraging words and he carried me to my bed afterwords 

"
20,He sounds like a douche to me.
21,Looking?üëÄ
22,I love askgaybros
23,"Holy shit.
As an insecure noob, this is the best thing i've ever read on gay dating."
24,"Well, congrats on doing the smartest thing possible and getting an attorney. If anyone of legal authority asks, ya'll didn't fuck.  Good luck. "
25,In one night you had sex (counting oral) with more guys than I have in my entire life. Congrats
26,All 3 of you just admit you like cock and get your fuck on together. Shit i'd love to be in your situation.
27,"Not even then. It has to be when he is ready. Love him and support him to make the decision himself. Outing someone against their will is an extremely shitty thing to do. Even when one's heart is in a good place, as yours clearly is. "
28,"There already is laws about this, abandoning minors is illegal, problem is most ppl are ignorant of the law so asshole parents get away with this bullshit."
29,"Yes, and it was good. So good that I continued sleeping with him for two months despite not liking any part of his personality."
30,"It sounds like you're pretty well-off and obviously like him and want to do the right thing. But you're creating a dynamic that doesn't work for everyone-- you're basically becoming a parent. 

He's much younger and comes from a really troubled life. You will have to deal with issues like ""is he with me because he loves me or because I'm helping him and he's screwed without me?"" and ""there are so many single, successful people my age, why am I doing this to myself?""-- all for someone you've known for a very short amount of time. 

This is from experience; I'm not trying to judge you. I think what you're doing is great and could possibly help someone who might have otherwise had a much more miserable life. But just remember it's your life too and that a relationship constantly serving another is not very balanced.

My last piece of advice is, don't project what you think he should do onto him. You might value college, he might not even be in a place where he's able to focus on that or know what to major in. He needs to independently want to improve, to want to succeed, etc. and it might be on a much slower pace than what you were able to do. Good luck."
31,Don't do that. That's how bi-claiming people got bad reputation.
32,"Just breathe buddy.  It's all going to be alright. üòâ  I'm in your boat (39, single for around a decade). I've got a very small circle of close friends, own my home and my car, and have a job that I really enjoy.  I definitely wouldn't mind finding someone that I click with and seeing where it leads, but I'm actually pretty damned happy with things as they are.  I used to worry about trying to find someone, but I finally just let go of it and it was the best thing I could've done.  I've tried the apps, but people just get so damned flaky on there that they've proved to be fairly useless. Now I figure if it's supposed to happen, it will.  Until then I'm sure as hell not going to feel sorry for myself.  Instead I spend my time enjoying my hobbies (Legos, boardgames, writing) and time with my friends.  Just try enjoying yourself and the things you currently have.  Truth is we are both still young and the possibilities are endless.  Hope this helps!"
33,"Damn, that's exactly why I won't come out. Not until got my own money. I can't help you bro, but I wish you the best! "
34,If you keep this mindset going you'll never be able to live at all. Stop worrying.
35,"Mods, sticky this. You'll be saving lives."
36,Come on. You know what they mean.
37,A professional cunt most likely
38,it is OK to be very selective **all the time**
39,"Thanks! Thats been the reason I've doubted my judgement.... ALL the girls a the mixer in one way or another asked me to apologize. But those are the same mindless bitches that don't say a word when he's telling store cashiers...

**""I know a dentist that can fix that terrible overbite""**"
40,"&gt; he was probably 25 so not in college anymore 


gurl..."
41,"I couldn't even begin to speculate what you must be feeling right now, but just as I'm sure your partner would feel - don't think you've failed him.

His memory is survived by you - the one who was his other half and very clearly cared for him dearly.

He parted with that memory, and I think that's just about the greatest gift you can give anyone.

Time will provide healing but don't think that there's anything wrong with taking the time you need to grieve. Share the time with friends, family and loved ones and please take care of yourself.

I am very sorry for your loss."
42,"It seems incredibly tame now that I'm older, but at the time I was a frustrated 19 year old closeted virgin. 

I was on a camping trip and the incredibly muscular older brother of one of my friends came along with us. So of course his default clothing choice was always being shirtless and wearing sweatpants without underwear and you could see the outline of his junk. 

For some reason he decided I was his go-to guy for applying sunblock to his back. I had never touched a man before like that and it was sweet torture that I never wanted to end. I was so thankful for my cargo shorts hiding my raging boner. "
43,"I think it sounds hot in theory but maybe a little scary in real life? 

I'm fairly slim myself and I met this big, hunky firefighter for coffee. He confessed that he liked small guys like me because it was easy to ""overpower"" them and ""take control."" He also said that tops got to decide how hard/fast to fuck, not the bottom. 

I didn't invite him back. "
44,"Being privileged isn't a bad thing, it isn't a good thing, it's just a fact.  You shouldn't feel guilty about being born white, or gay, or male, etc.  
Where it becomes a problem is when you take advantage of that privilege without doing anything to extend those opportunities to people without the same privilege, or when you don't seek to understand how your privilege affects those opportunities.

&gt; This feels even more odd in the gay community because I grew up with parents from conservative small town America, and struggled with my gay identity a lot. Yet in the gay community I'm treated sometimes as if I get better treatment than nonwhite gays, even though I get snubbed quite a bit.

This part I want to try to address, because this is where things get messier.

As a white person, you benefit from white privilege. As a man, you benefit from male privilege. As a gay person, you do not benefit from straight privilege.  
Every person has their own intersection of privileges, both beneficial and non.  The point should not be to seek some global ""privilege score"", but to understand scenarios where your intersection of privileges put you at an advantage over others.

&gt; What is the end game with all of this talk about white privilege?

I'm a white, straight-passing, cis-male.  I was privileged to have access to a computer at a young age, and the free time to learn about the computer and develop an interest in building websites.  I was privileged to be able to live at home while going through high-school, without the need for a part-time job, which allowed me to focus on doing well at school.  I worked hard at school and put in effort, and my effort was rewarded... but that's because I was in a position where I was able to put in that focus and effort. That doesn't invalidate my effort, but it's important to think about the advantages that I had.

The question now is what can I do to use my privilege to help make those advantages available to people that don't have the same background as me.

One way that I can use my privilege to help disadvantages people is to try to make my local tech community a safer place for those people.  That means being on the lookout for sexism, racism, and homophobic/transphobic language, and taking a stand against it.  Openly challenge it, because at this time it's safer for me to do it as a white man than it is for a white woman or a black man.

You can't change the whole world, but you can start to change the parts of the world that you interact with on a regular basis."
45,"You need new friends, you need better friends. "
46,They make the best lovers because they know how to listen 
47,"Love can make people do stupid things.

Maybe he'll reach out to you in the future, who knows. It's a sucky situation though, and I'm sorry."
48,"""Professional."" Professional what, exactly?"
49,"Wait wait wait, how close is your son to 16? Do not forget, he's still a guy, don't compare him to a 15/16 year old girl. Just because he's gay it's not the same. You didn't have to influence me to do shit at 15 because I was already a horny teenager. I think you should let him have his lunch date, tell him that if he does plan on being sexually active he should make sure he's careful, STIs are usually nasty, and he's young, he doesn't want to deal with that now, stick with the no late night dates, don't give him special treatment or rules the other kids don't have..don't treat him any different than if he was dating a girl essentially. EDIT: your approach is only ignorant because you're treating him differently because he's gay, that's not what he wants. Be a dad, give him a condom. Tell him you hope he doesn't *need* it but if he does, at least he has it."
50,Why would you describe to your parents what you do sexually with your boyfriend? Straight people don't! 
51,This is abandonment and it's illegal. Go to the police. 
52,"Not sure if hot, but definitely funny. Was having random political argument with my roommate. 

He says ""the problem with you bleeding hearts is you got no balls"" - he reaches out actually grabs my balls/dick through my shorts in a tight grip. I get hard before I realize it and he collapses to the ground laughing."
53,We bow down to your pure loins. *May they never be touched again.*
54,"A closeted case. Try to approach him, guide him out of Narnia. I was like that once - oh, the bizarre things internalized homophobia and confusion do to you... "
55,This guy fucks.
56,I think you've caught hypochondria
57,[deleted]
58,"First thing is first. He probably overreacted. Give him a few days and try to calmly talk to him, and ask him how he feels. If he outs you to your parents, hopefully they're more understanding and accepting than him. Now here's the part you don't want to hear: you shouldn't have been fucking your boyfriend in your parents house at 15 if you don't want to get caught."
59,"Another hot and funny memory. A bunch of us first year associates were sitting around a table having lunch. 

I was having a salad and didn't realize I had a spot of dressing on my lower lip. All of a sudden, he takes a napkin, reaches out toward me and just wipes it off my lip with a smile. That was probably the most unintentionally homoerotic/fraternal thing someone's ever done to me. 

Still don't really understand the gesture to this day. My other two co-workers seem surprised too. "
60,Lol. What city does he live in? What's his phone number? 
61,"IDGAF- Flirty eye contact is fun, if I catch some guy checking me out, Ill make sure he knows I notice, if he is hot he gets the wink. "
62,He's probably getting hard too.
63,Fresh meat factor. 
64,"If we all could only have your problems... My parents found out I'm gay and now want to meet my boyfriend! I'm gonna have to sleep in the same bed as my 6'3"" college football player boyfriend when I go home for holidays!"
65,"Most of the time I see this advice, it's being given to independent adults. Teenagers are often told just to stick it out until they're independent. "
66,I said I was going to study at the library during the hours of 7-9 on a Saturday Gameday. I went to hook up in a threesome instead lol
67,Nice to see that you got back on your feet.
68,Probably has to do with Mike Pence being the Vice President and the fact that the Republicans reinforced that they're still focused on holding those backward views at their convention a few months ago. 
69,"I was never out in high school, but there was this one really hot kid that had this fantastic gay dar. He knew. 


One day he pulled me to the side after school and very bluntly said ""Listen, you're an 8 (thanks for the compliment) and I'm a 4, but you're really hot, so PLEASE let me fuck you. It's big, so, that should make up for my appearance."" 


I didn't do it, I was too shy and self conscious to say yes :(. I was also a virgin and kinda wasn't ready to swipe my card yet. If I could go back and do it, I would do it. Especially since that guys a straight porn star now, and he wasn't lying when he said it was big. "
70,something tells me that if he fucked you in the ass he may be a little gay
71,"**WhAT** 

*do*

you^mean"
72,So many. Basically any guy who is walking or standing in front of me. 
73,"Regarding the ""He couldn't answer"", it is possible that he could be feeling a combination of fear and shame, and silence is a form of emotional self-defense when you feel that kind of pain to stop yourself from acknowledging it.

I've felt that combination before, and that's how I've responded several times: by not responding. Staying silent, looking down, and waiting for the other person to ""time out"". 

Not saying it's right, but he could be in emotional denial about his situation."
74,"Don't do anything. Either he was too drunk to know what he was doing, or he needs to be drunk to express his true feelings, which can **never** lead to a healthy relationship.

Next time you see him, pretend nothing happened. If he approaches you to talk about it do so of course."
75,No fats no fems no spice no rice no chocolate. Its people like them that made the Trump presidency a reality.
76,"I want to help you, I just need to understand. He'll only take it that WAY, if you make it that way. So just pull him into the garage or whatever manly space you dwell in, tell him that you love him, to have fun, and to be safe. Slip the boy a condom, tell him these words ""I'm not giving you this because I want you to use it, I'd really prefer you wait until you're old enough to understand what comes with this, but I want you to be safe."" Add whatever you want into that, but try to be the friend this time. Not the bad cop. This is that situation with boys where dad needs to be the friend, mom can be bad cop on this one. If you have daughters, then you get to be bad cop when she gets them birth control. You have an opportunity to build a bond with your son right now. Don't fuck it up dad! I'm just kidding, but for real, don't fuck it up lol be his cool dad this time."
77,"""He don't know it ... but I'm gettin' firm too ...""

But seriously, cuddling gives people boners. It ain't no thang, OP."
78,have sex with a trans man who looks 100% like a guy except for still having a vagina.
79,"It's a psychologically abusive relationship and now the boyfriend has taken the next step of cutting out friends and family. He's taking over his life, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it until your friend wakes up to smell the roses for himself."
80,"I feel like you shouldn't even be fucking at 15, but then again different strokes for different folks..."
81,I'm the middle child (boys) and all three of us are gay. Go figure
82,"""deleting soon""

- is that a threat? ok thanks for letting us now! üåö I am now compelled to message you because time is running out!!!! It's the end of the world!!!1!

""it's my birthday üéÇ"" ""birthday boy""

- are you really announcing this on an app to app strangers you don't even know?

""YoPro""

- lol. I can't. 


Guys who call me pet names like ""stud"" gross me the fuck out. "
83,"It's really disappointing that the first two comments on this post are negative ones... come on guys, can you chill with being petty for just one minute?? Regardless of whether or not you agreed with this politics, an innocent man died, and by the looks of his twitter, he left behind a family. Have some compassion, if you're capable."
84,I have an older brother he's the gay one I just bang dudes.
85,"I went to a concert and the drummer had taken off his top, I shouted ""he's fit as fuck"". My friend just looked me, I was like ""physically I mean"" hahaha "
86,Upvote for very nice text styling üëçüèº
87,[deleted]
88,"Do not tell them. No matter how well it turns out with your parents, it will betray the trust he showed you.  

Do find a time to tell him that all these observations - grades, not hanging out, picking fights - are signs he's depressed. If he won't go to your parents, then maybe some other professional can help. 

Tell him it's ok to talk to you. Is he seeing someone?  Is he having boyfriend problems?  Admit that you won't have all the answers and may not always understand things, but you'll try and you'll always love him. 

If your parents ask you about his behavior, your first answer should be ""have you asked him?""  "
89,Just because someone doesn't want to fuck you doesn't mean they're anti-you.
90,"I would date a vegan as long as they didn't give me shit for not being a vegan. That however, is generally too much to ask of the few vegans I have met. "
91,"No, but it's unrealistic at times, the top just sticks in, no major prep work, the bottom doesn't even need a minute to adjust to it, and sometimes you can just tell the actors are forcing it."
92,"My best friend in high school came to stay with me over spring break at my parents cabin on a lake, one day we were on the dock and he just outta nowhere scooped me up and jumped off the dock. It was surprising to say the least, but I remember when we got out of the water his clothes hung to his skin and then I started to freeze so he pulled me in close to keep warm before we headed upstairs to the house"
93,"You called him out on being a dick. Not sure how this makes you homophobic? You didn't make any comment denigrating his homosexuality, just the fact he's a prissy, caustic fuckwit. I don't think you have anything to apologise for. He does though."
94,"I'm pretty conventionally attractive, just an All-American Military/police fellow. But at times I would be slightly envious of those I found out of this world attractive (as plenty do). 

But then I realized this is the face my friends love. This is the face my mom loves. I would never want to be any different. "
95,"* I'll never accidentally have a child I'm not 100% prepared for.
* Amazing gay-cations and making friends all over the world.
* Walking into any gay bar in the world and feeling welcome with a common bond.
* Feeling comfortable in my own skin, wearing speedos at the beach and not giving a fuck, etc
* Grindr"
96,How do they feel about Pence?
97,Ask him if it's legal. It'd be a funny icebreaker. 
98,"Back when I was in the closet, a girl asked me if I was gay. I responded by saying ""whaaaat?! No! I think Idina Mendel is hot!"" And that has to be the gayest thing I've ever said or done. "
99,Who said creative writing degrees are useless?
100,Only looking for friends. 
101,Had a guy in college dorms demand I go to bed to be ready for finals. He just picked me up sideways and carried me to my bed and threw me in it. Didn't even find that guy cute and that still totally woke something inside me.
102,"Well damnit, I must just be one immature ass cunt. If my dad pulled this shit I wouldn't speak to him for at least a year or two, I'd be too mad. 


Inviting him to thanks giving? Without even telling or asking you? I just flat out wouldn't show up, even if he uninvited the guy. "
103,"I understand you are worried, but dont tell anyone about this, just hold on for 6 months and you will be with people who will love you for you.


I dont know where you live but once you get out of there you will be free, you just got to hold on."
104,That means semen
105,"I took a train that I knew my crush would be on. Across several national borders. With my very last money, which was just enough for a one-way ticket. He seemed happy and impressed to see me on the train, but at destination, he just went off with his friends, leaving me behind to sleep on the pavement outside the station and then hitchhike home (I got molested by one of my rides on the way)."
106,"Started going to the gym, started counting calories, lost 50lbs, bought new clothes, went to dermatologist for acne, got teeth whitened, got a better job.

It worked. We dated for less time than it took to make those changes.

Then I went back to my old habits and I'm literally fatter than ever and back at my old job (after getting fired at better job)."
107,That's adorable......and the start to several xtube videos
108,Congrats! I'm glad it went well.
109,"I'm typically not the lovey-dovey type, but completely honest, I realized that I loved my boyfriend when I flipped out on him for no apparent reason (I don't even know why I did it tbh, I guess I was just in a bad mood) and then right after we had the big fight, which I caused for no apparent reason other than I was having a moody day I guess, he got up and was walking out of our apartment and I shouted and asked him where he was going and he said ""FUCKING MCDONALDS DO YOU WANT SOMETHING?"" I shouted back No fuck you, you know I'm on a diet don't try and sabotage me like that, and he said ""WELL FUCKING FUCK YOU TOO YOU FUCKING CUCK!"" (that was the day I googled cuck and learned what it meant btw [the more you know](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cuzj7i1Whs/maxresdefault.jpg)) and then he closed the door, maybe 1 minute later, he popped his head back in and said ""I still love you though."" He had come all the way back from down the hall just to tell me that before he left because he knew we should never walk away from each other angry, because you never know what could happen. 



I love how I can flip out on him and be mad at him or whatever, and his response is always the same ""I love you though."" 


When you've got someone who will completely put up with all of your shit, and then still love you, almost like they love you unconditionally, then you know you've got a keeper. "
110,"My boyfriend was very shy when I met him, and still is when he first meets someone. I personally love it. It intrigued me. He also told me that he likes to observe people before he decides if they're worth his time, and I must say, he's a *really* good judge of character."
111,Well I do play the cello so I'm contractually obligated to like classical music...
112,"Marty, you've got a great boyfriend and a supportive family. You find yourself at an enviable place in life for even a straight guy before you've even hit your twenties. Please learn to accept your incredible fortune with grace. Take your boyfriend to meet your parents and stop worrying about what might be going on in their imaginations, and instead focus on how incredible the people in your life are."
113,I'm shy too. It's difficult to date for me. Everyone always tells me that I need to speak up more.
114,"Twinks with a bubble butt. Really, a cute face with a nice ass does it for me every time. I prefer people shorter than me. Have yet to meet anyone taller that I liked. "
115,"Well you're here, so maybe get off your high horse. "
116,The day after the break up.
117,That's so cute of you... üò≥üò≥
118,"Hey, I just saw this on r/all/new and I can say I don't hate you because you are gay!

I am a straight male, and I have no hatred based on sexuality/race, hell most things. If you are a decent person, then you are fine with me.

I know I am a stranger, but I just wanted you to know that not everyone carries hate around with them, and for sure some do, just don't let your thoughts get consumed by the bigots and fools.

Many, people are ok with how others are.

Have a good day friend, and I hope your day improves."
119,TIL being 30 is old. 
120,"&gt;I may have a thing for daddies that I didn't realize.

So it begins."
121,"So true.

So much of the coming out advise that out gay people share only has to with being proud and honest, which is a great message, but pride and honesty doesn't help homeless gays who get kicked out by their parents at all. Those who share the pride and honesty angle need to be more careful and also include a personal financial strategy too. "
122,Maybe. As long as he's not a Trump supporter.
123,"Ok it seems like a closet case, however, why the hell would you ever date him. Is he THAT hot you can forget all the shit he said about you?

I can understand you being aroused but *in love*? Have some self respect, bro."
124,People who take the whole 'alpha' thing seriously and apply the term to themselves usually are.
125,"I'm going to be really controversial (since this is a mostly American based sub unfortunately) and say that 17 is not young/child.


 A 17 year old can be mature, loving and make decisions. It's also not ""creepy"" to love the guy. You were 17 once and be honest, you can give consent at the age of 17. And Hell. You didn't even notice that he wasn't 22.


He might have lied to you about his age because he was afraid you might not love him anymore due to him being 17. And hey, he was apparently right. What I'm saying: if you both love each other, don't break due to society's obsession with numbers and use your head. He clearly is ready and mature enough.


It's sad to see so many people here trying to separate you two immediately because of the number 17. 17 ffs is legal in most European countries even."
126,"Wait what? Why are the two mutually exclusive? I'm in a nonmonogamous relationship and I love my partner more than anything. We bond perfectly well, thank you very much."
127,"&gt;Maybe they are bartenders or retail workers?

Yes, actually. Retail trade, accommodation and food service are the 3 largest employment sectors of the US economy, making up 18% of all workers. There are many other sectors that also wouldn't give a shit. Think about all those back-office employees who are not customer facing and thus don't reflect on the business because no one knows who they are. "
128,"Whatever you do, please be careful. If this is how your brother has always been and you didn't know, you can't know what else he's hiding. White supremacists aren't known for being accepting of the LGBT community. At all. And if this is a recent, drastic, shift in your brother's personality, maybe he's in a bad place emotionally or psychologically. Either way, you need to keep yourself safe. 

Also consider your sister-in-law and niece. Do they know? Are they in any danger? (rhetorical--keep these in mind) 

Just keep yourself and your family safe. I'm sorry you're going through this. 

*edit for additional well wishes "
129,Have sex with someone i really love.
130,Suicide.
131,"I like normal guys, a little bit of a belly and a little (or a lot) of body hair. I don't like thin or very muscled guys."
132,"Just married my partner of 7 years last month, we built a new house 2 years ago, we both have new vehicles, both have great jobs, great friends, basically we want for nothing.

Everything is good right now."
133,"I would've probably been really alone if I had. I'm glad I didn't. Being gay in my high school may not have gotten you bullied, but you had extremely few male friends. People were polite, yet you were ostracized. Of course, we only had 2 openly gay guys I knew of. They were friends with all the girls, acted in the drama club, and were flamboyant as hell. Would've fucked them both incidentally. 

It just wasn't a good environment to be gay in. Not the worst. Not the best."
134,"&gt;Because I can change my perspective, but I can't change the world.

Those points are very far apart on a scale of your ability to influence.

You could call out overt racist shit you encounter, strike up a convo about some more implicit/ignorant racism.

You could purposefully seek out things made by non-white people, support non-white creators of things, spread their messages and think pieces...."
135,"Nothing pisses me off quite like internet speak and half-ass grammar.

""Hi how r u? Im gud. U lking?""

I don't care if they're cute as fuck, I refuse to talk to guys who can't type with actual words and full sentences. "
136,"I was going to recommend Prayers for Bobby as well, that film really had 15 year-old me crying my eyes out"
137,Daily Mail stories should be verified against a second source. It has a tabloid quality and can rush to publish before getting important context and details.
138,"My guy precums like a fountain. And as the bottom it also feels amazing.

We've had sex a few times without any lube because he's just pouring it out. "
139,Drop it.  Keep hanging out with him like normal.  Get drunk together.
140,For some stupid reason I had climbed into a tree during my undergrad. I got stuck and a gorgeous jock grabs a ladder and carried me down. I flirted and I think he flirted back but I was definitely praying he didn't feel the heat radiate off my loins 
141,Some are. Some aren't. Gay men represent the full spectrum of virtues and vices found in straight people. Being judgmental is a human problem. Haven't found it to be any more from gay men. I think we just notice it more when we're trying to date people. We miss all the judgment flying among straight people since we don't care to try to win their affections.
142,"AFAIK it's legal, and morally neutral.  The question is, how comfortable are you with the idea of what 'that guy' is going to use the underwear for?  If he is going to wear it over his head while he spanks the monkey, whatever, but if he is a serial killer who wants to leave false DNA evidence at a crime scene, you've got a problem.  You might want to keep your receipt."
143,Talk to him and give us updates.
144,I think they should all wait till they meet that closeted gay guy Kevin.
145,"*gasp*
"
146,"At some point he will be back and I beg you to be forgiving. It doesn't mean that you should forget what he did, though. You should be candid and tell him how much hurt he caused doing what he did. Remember that our lives are too short to waste with grudges."
147,"I spent the last of my money to buy a plane ticket to spend my only vacation time this year with someone I've known for almost 7 years.  We've never met in person, but now we are finally making it happen.

Results TBA, bros.  I have all the butterflies."
148,"Oh man, I'm Mexican too and I know it's extremely rough. It might not be a matter of moving out of the country entirely, but maybe move to a bigger city that's more accepting like Mexico city or Guadalajara. I know it's unlikely that your family will come around, but mine did surprisingly. Maybe yours could too? If you don't feel safe coming out then don't come out until you feel safe. Don't rush it, and there's nothing wrong with denying if you feel like it'll be harmful to come out. Cuidate mucho hemano. "
149,"Parents cant cut ties with their gay sons ex boyfriend who dumped him and invite him over to thanksgiving

Its like a Netflix original come to life"
150,When I've bought my first house I'm going to open a free room for people like you. 
151,"Damn I feel the same. I hate it. I just want to be able to go meet a guy and not think ""damn what if someone sees me?"". I see guys and girls, friends and strangers, on my campus kissing, holding hands, hugging, talking about girls, flirting, planning their future after uni, ...Sometimes I see guys and it hurts I can't even say ""he's hot"".

The worst is when someone asks ""damn she's hot, she has a nice booty doesn't she?"" and I'm like ""euh, yeah, I guess...I mean it's definitely,...euh...big?"" lmao. Or ""why don't you ever flirt/try to date girls?"" ""Let me first finish my bachelor at least, medical school is more important"" when the night before I was jacking off to the hairiest dude on the internet hahaha

The worst is, I can't even bring myself to hook-up. That's not me. I love love (for some weird reason). I want to hug way more than having sex with someone (don't get me wrong I want that too). I just need something deeper.

It's a lonely life. Sometimes, I ask myself ""what if I die tomorrow and never experience love"" cheesy I know, but that's how I feel.
Sadly, I'm only twenty and far from being financially independent. But believe me when I tell you that the day I have my first official paycheck I'm gooooone. Byeee. 

But then again, once I come out-will I be able to hold hands without checking my surroundings? Kissing without hearing some dumb alpha male straight shit? Who knows?

I guess I'm just writing you this to tell you you're not alone at all.
"
152,"There's literally an infinite number of dick pis on the internets, and the number of dicks being added is greater than the number one can consume at once. 

So the real question is, who should be more ashamed: the guy putting his wiener on the internet, or the married dude fapping to it?"
153,I totally agree about being upfront. He was very nice throughout the date. But just really aggressive. He asked if I ever got scared going home with stronger guys because I basically wouldn't have any choice in what was going to be done to me. (How was I supposed to read that statement?) 
154,Honestly for some people being monogamous just doesn't work and that's okay. There's nothing wrong with it.
155,"No, but I can dream"
156,"Sent you a PM. 

It's normal to feel anxious. It's great you came here for help. 

First, don't second guess your decision. You didn't do anything wrong. Your parents are wrong for responding to their child like this, and it's great that your friend's parent's are being supportive. 

If you need to talk to someone immediately, or at any point down the road, here are 2 options that should be familiar with situations like yours:

The Trevor Project: 1-866-488-7386
GLBT National Youth Talkline: 1-800-246-PRIDE (7743)

Are you in or near a large city that may have an LGBT resource center of some sort?"
157,"I'd add ""are you financially independent and not under the immediate threat of antigay violence?"""
158,"So, anything that could feel like disapproval or friction will embolden a teen, even if they're imagining it. 

I think maybe the best approach if possible would be to have the other boy over and show enthusiasm for getting to know him. At least then, the other boy has real people in his head if he's thinking of just emotionally coercing your son. It also creates a pattern where your son can know any limits you want to put on him as a 15 year old dating aren't because he's gay, but because he's 15. The other could end up just being really nice and nerdy, which would be a relief. It's hard to know. 

I think your gut on pumping dating brakes on a 15-year-old are still good. I think kids adjust better and don't lose site of planning for their future if sex happens later. One thing that got to me at 15 was adults romanticizing the idea of taking things slow as a teen since the joy in little things when you're innocent isn't something you get back later. So, the idea that how great just holding hands for the first time or even someone just putting their arm around you the first time feels. You want to go slow to savor all those things as special instead of just rushing to sex. Kids are emotional romantics, so I think that language makes sense to them."
159,Graduated college a virgin and still am a few years later.
160,"When I came out in High School it felt like I started a firestorm. There were guys coming out to me left and right not including the straight guys who befriended me looking for sexual favors lol. Looking back I should have taken those offers to be honest. Jocks from the Wrestling, Rugby, and Basketball teams...ugh, talk about missed opportunities. I had A LOT of homoerotic relationships in HS. The attention was flattering even if it didn't lead anywhere...for the most part.

Some of it was kind of awkward, like one guy ""M"" who asked me to hangout with him and his friend (a girl). I realized after an hour into it that we were on a date and the girl was his beard. He was so in the closet he wouldn't even admit it. We finally hooked up when I left HS. Ridiculous. "
161,They're doing an excellent job of systemically eliminating any reason for people to visit the sub at all. 
162,"Son turned 15 2 weeks ago, the boy that asked him about is 16.5.  I am not treating him any differently for being gay, but I feel like he will take it that way.  The gay thing has never bothered anyone in our family and he knows he is loved.  I am the ""bad"" cop when it comes to mom and dad.  This is just how my wife and I work.  His mom is a lot more chill when it comes to any issues.  I try to chill, but I have a slight temper that I am working on.  I am not a raging asshole, but I do over react at times.  I have to remind myself that his brain is growing and that I don't have to win every argument... and yes, I am wrong some times.  I am just trying to help my kid out and keep my cool.  That is why I am here."
163,sucking dick?
164,Find a boyfriend that isn't petty enough to get mad at you for masturbating  
165,"Good job on no longer sleeping with him. Keep that up. 

From his point of view, I can see why he might have lied. He knew his real age would preclude most people from touching him, he probably did need shelter, and he found you. Now, does that mean he doesn't have any feelings for you? No. Does it mean you have to be cautious that he is just using you? Yes. 

I get not wanting to kick him out cause he says he comes from a dangerous home. This is really not something Internet strangers can help you with. You're going to have to make a character judgement of him. Is this the only major lie he's told?

Sit down, have a conversation with him and discuss this. Get the truth out of him on everything. You have to decide if you still want him living with you."
166,"I'm the worst when it comes to eye contact, even in a gay-friendly environment. I'll see a guy, make eyes, then avert. I much prefer something a little more blunt, like saying, ""hi."""
167,"How does a 17 yo with parents that he can't trust to love unconditionally learn that he can trust you?  

The answer is that it's in no way easy, and for someone that age in those circumstances, you need to come up with some forgiveness. That doesn't mean forgive and forget, it means forgive and learn - both of you. 

You do need to find out the local law to determine what your risks are. You also need to find out if he's telling the truth about being kicked out, though I'm not sure how. Assuming he is and assume you're not at risk legally, then the next question is how best to help hive get on his feet - with or without the relationship. Continuing the relationship is your decision, and I wouldn't judge you either way, nor would I criticize you if your answer is to help him find another safe place to stay. But as long as he comes clean and stays truthful now, I'd encourage you to help him somehow. "
168,"You can help him grow up by dumping his ass, and ofcourse you can find someone else, you talk as if hes your only ticket."
169,Possibly as long as he doesn't ask me for tree fiddy.

174,Yes. It does. Just try farting in the shower one day. You'll regret it.
