0,Maybe he used every ounce of courage he had to flirt with you and your brutal rejection caused him to commit suicide.
1,"Hell no!!  I'm 68 today.  Stopped giving a shit what other people think decades ago.  

In my wayward youth I was called a faggot, cocksucker, fairy, queer, pansy, communist and a nigger lover.  If I cared what they said I wouldn't have been on that picket line, in that demonstration.  Fighting against social mores isn't a party.  Once you let the names roll off your back, living life as you like it is much easier.  

"
2,"That's tragically hilarious lol. Like a television plot really. 

He seems to be a real gentleman about it all. I don't know, If I was you I'd spin it into a positive thing. Did you interact with him a lot all day? You could maybe establish with him that you want to only focus on your work if you cross paths while on the clock."
3,"Had a guy run after me just to tell me he liked my shirt. I said I had no time and I was late for class. But he insisted on talking some more and saying if I liked Aretha Franklin (it was on my shirt). Said sorry but I was late, and pulled my arm away from him and ran into the building. I only realized at the end of the day that he was into me. I was actually running from Sephora a few blocks away and had a Sephora bag in my hands so i guess I screamed gay. He was a 10/10 too. :( I hoped to run into him at school all semester but I never saw him again. "
4,I'm real and he's imaginary.
5,Some people are more rich than they are gay. 
6,This will be funny 10 years from now when they're married with a 3 year old at Christmas dinner. 
7,"I was a bit curious myself because I've never used a dildo.. so I was searching through reddit post and I think I found a reply that pretty much sums up all the aspects outside of using a dildo...

I'm not sure if it'll be helpful in your case though 

&gt;I just recently had my first real cock, and I can tell you the main difference is heat. A real cock is a lot warmer. The second biggest difference is that there is another person who is also getting pleasure... And he's the one deciding exactly how you're getting fucked. There is something to be said for not having control of how fast it goes in and out, or how deep, or if he stops to catch his breath with his cock buried balls deep. It adds to the pleasure to feel his hips slapping against your ass cheeks, or to feel the weight of his body on top of yours.


 "
8,Probably every hint I've ever gotten
9,"Guys usually call me ""no"" "
10,"Listen man. Here's the truth- sexuality is like water. So many ""straight"" people have done really gay things they will never talk about. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe everything is black and white. Straight/ gay. I think everyone has tendencies because we're complicated creatures. 

I wouldn't worry about labeling yourself as gay or bi. Embrace your feelings for what they are, then grow and move on. You're ok "
11,"The teachers reaction is perfectly normal from the standpoint that he's 17, and you are 27- that's a 10 year gap between a person who's almost an adult. I approve of your relationship because of the steps you made to make it right. You wanted to make sure that he was ok. "
12,"You want a nice open relationship and you want to bring a third partner into bed. Oh and you're bi, so this extra partner is a woman. He'll run for the hills. "
13,"He's a hung top, I'm a power bottom.

Honestly, it's a huge pain in the ass."
14,"14% of LGBT voters voted for Trump. Now I know being LGBT should really have no bearing on how you view the economy, race, gun control etc. (basically anything other than LGBT rights), but it boggles my mind that some would vote for a ticket with Mike fucking Pence on it. Trump's views on LGBT issues are *questionable* at best (I'm of the mind he truly doesn't give a shit either way), but Mike Pence's are not, and that dudes gonna have a huge impact on Trump's policies. "
15,Gay men still exist past 30 you know. 
16,I was dating a boy for three weeks before I realized we were dating. 
17,When I'm alone and I voice my displeasure with design choices on HGTV
18,"HAHA. I've never watched a more guilty interview. The fact that he can't answer yes or no is basically outing himself, making his interview into a confessional. Just out with it already. 

He pree cute doe"
19,"I don't see why anything should change. It's awkward now but a few months later you'll be ""that couple"" telling this cute story on how you met to all your friends. 


Enjoy your new job and enjoy your new boyfriend! Try not to overthink things and just enjoy these two lucky things happening in your life - let yourself feel on top of the world ðŸ™‚ "
20,"Two people left alone will tend to fuck, and after the fucking people go to sleep. So, go out and do stuff before going home. Go to a book store, a movie, a restaurant, or just look at all the puppies in a petsmart. Then go home and fuck."
21,Your straight best friend isn't in love with you
22,"yeah no this doesnt always work.

humans are innately social, and though some may be more introverted than others, pouring all of your love into yourself can only work for so long.

one of the universal horrors of the human condition is *loneliness*... we go back to old stories of how people lived, what they wrote, and we see it's a common trend; no one wants to die alone.

so yeah, OP, this can be a good short term solution but it doesnt work for everyone, and not permanently for *anyone*"
23,"' &gt;:(

BAD!"
24,"None of the above since you were never actually born, you were removed."
25,"Your story moved me. Good thing you did not end your life. Lesson of story: There are far, far better things ahead than any we leave behind.

Wipe your tears my friend. Move forward. Believe that the greatest times of life are still ahead."
26,A platinum-star tumor.
27,"""Damn, I was just joking when I thought Carl was checking me out, but I guess every gay gay I've been friends with *has* wanted to fuck me. Huh. Men are pigs."""
28,"Maybe she's sorry. Slowly open the door. Honestly, I'd send the watches back cause I wouldn't want to send the message that I was only talking to her because of the gifts, because I was potentially expecting more. That, and my own personal feelings are that I don't like expensive gifts.

Talk to your mother cause you want to build the relationship again. Take the gifts out of the equation beyond their being a symbol of regret and apology. That's what they are. "
29,The end of 2016
30,That makes me so hungry for cock! 
31,"our son once had an accident when we were potty training him. he shouted: ""daddy, my butt is all wet!""
my husband went to sort stuff out, when he came back we continued the deed and next thing he says:

""daddy, my butt-""

i've send him to the couch"
32,"It means he wants to give you money, and lots of it, while you rub in his face the lavish lifestyle you are living with his money. It's pretty much the best fetish you can possibly indugle. Do it."
33,"Because Australia got the criminals, Canada got the French, and we got the puritans. "
34,69
35,"Ok, I see what you're saying. But some of us have unique and legit problems. Like what if I want to come out to my parents because I really can't get over this crush on my straight friend and I'm really only attracted to white guys and I don't understand why so many gay guys act so fem? "
36,Zero risk of pregnancy. That and I'll trade anal for blowjobs any day.
37,"&gt;He pree cute doe

Powerful and outspoken bigots are categorically unfuckable.  This should be the iron law of the gay community; watch how fast the homophobic closet-cases shut up when they can't have their ""slip-ups"" on grindr."
38,This really is not a topic to joke about mate.
39,"I try to always have fresh flowers in my house, and when I'm trimming them and putting them in vases I feel gay as fuck and I love it."
40,"The first time my partner ask me out for movies back in college(we weren't together yet). We were both from a same group of friends in class. He asked me, and me only while we were in a corner just the two of us and quietly. I stupidly turned around and went to annouced it to the whole group of friends. Fortunately most of them couldn't make it. Unfortunately, the most annoying guy in the group decided to tag along and he was the only third wheel, although I didn't feel like he was a third wheel then as i was oblivious it was supposed to be a date. We still laugh about that situation 10 years on."
41,"Fuck your friends?   
Seems cheaper unless you all find each other unattractive "
42,It's called being a side.
43," To make matters worse, his national security advisor is a massive piece of shit. She outed her gay brother to her family in the early 90s while the guy was dying of AIDS. 

These are not nice people and he is not picking nice people. These are his choices. Even worse than the gay rights issues, he's picking people who are wholly unqualified."
44,"Top/Bottom has *NOTHING* to do with being masculine or feminine, dominant or submissive, or anything else other than being insertive or receptive. Period.

There are nelly queens who top like mofos and there are lumberjack men's men who bottom like they can't get enough cock. 

There are service tops (submissive tops) and there are power bottoms (dominant bottoms.) 

So just do it. You don't have to be assertive or manly to fuck someone with your dick. Just find someone who likes taking charge and fuck them the way they ask you to man. 

You do you; but, please get over this feeling you're having that being submissive or somehow not assertive means you can't top."

such a gentleman"
46,"6-8 month minimum. I wouldn't want to be brought into your child's life if I wasn't sure I was going to stay. It's not healthy for people to come in and out of a child's life like that, and I'd hate for that child to wonder where I went a year later if we didn't last."
47,I'm annoyed just by her description.
48,I'm really good at playing dead.

50,"a friend from college who I hadn't seen in a few years was visiting NYC for work.

we met up at a bar to drink and catch-up, and after both of us getting a bit tipsy, he asked if I wanted to see the view from his hotel room.

totally oblivious to what he was trying to get at, I joked that I see the Manhattan skyline view all the time and I'd rather just keep drinking.

we never mentioned the entire conversation ever again."
51,"C'mon, it was a little funny, just a tad...."
52,"Yep, but then I get horny again and the vicious cycle goes on."

57,Sluttier. 
58,"Hand, sometimes if I care about him enough, I'll call him Right Hand "
59,"Just be normal. Don't stare and don't not stare. Looking at the floor is as obvious as going gangbusters over staring. Acknowledge faces and just do your business. I imagine most gay or straight notice, but few outside of creeps will dwell.

You didn't like the older guy, some wouldn't like you staring at them either, regardless of age. So keep that in mind."
60,eh i let gay dude put their penises in my butthole. doesn't get much gayer than that. 
61,"&gt; Country boy

Many LGBT people are ""country boys.""

&gt; Very straight acting.

There's not such thing.  There are however varying degrees of masculinity and femininity.

Not having sex with women doesn't make you gay.

You don't get to choose your sexuality.  That's just a reality of life.  You like guys?  Suppressing it won't change that.  That's what conversion therapy tried to do, and now it's a debunked practice (and banned in more areas as time goes on).

&gt; I have no attraction to girls at all but I do to guys.

That's perfectly normal.  Heteronormative society tells us it's not because it's weird, but the reality is there are millions who have same sex attraction.

&gt; I don't really have anyone to talk about it because all my friends are straight and I've tried with my closest, but it was either just a phase or they just didn't know what to say to help me.

You shouldn't expect everyone to know what to say.  Unless you're LGBT or have close friends/family that are, it's really hard to talk about.  You don't know what you don't know.  A good friend will listen and support you.  That doesn't mean tell you what to do.  That means no matter what you do, they will still be your friend and defend your right to be who you are.  Friends who say ""it's just a phase,"" are not being good friends.

&gt; People are starting to notice

How?  What could you possibly be doing?  Has someone said ""hey, you're acting gay?""  Which if they have, they're assholes.  From what it seems you behave according to most gender and behavioral norms.  You could just be thinking about that because it's on your mind so much right now.  

&gt; I want to be straight so bad

Can you come up with a legitimate reason that doesn't involve you trying to fit in/be normal/to avoid people thinking negatively about you?  You say it's what you want, but for most closeted people who say that, it's not what they want...it's what they want to want.  

&gt; Wife and kids, nice house

You can still do that.  Maybe not a wife, but you can have a spouse, kids, and a nice house.  Being LGBT doesn't mean you're throwing your ideal life away.  Who knows...you could even be bisexual and still have a wife.  There are more sexualities out there than just straight and gay.  The ""American Dream,"" of a mother/father, heteronormative lifestyle, kids, white picket fence, two cars...yadda yadda, is not the key to a happy life, nor do you need that to be considered successful.

You gotta start thinking for yourself and what you want, not what you think you are supposed to want.  You say it's what you want, but in reality, most closeted people saying these things just don't want to be different.  

You're having a lot of self-loathing, which isn't uncommon with closeted LGBT people.  A lot of it comes from a homophobic upbringing and internalized homophobia.  I used to be the same way (I'm bisexual).  I used to want the same things you do, including a wife, big house, all that jazz.  I'm telling you from my experience and from many others...those are material things.  They will not make you happy unless your conscious is clear and you are at peace with yourself.  Wanting to be straight will not allow you to do that.  

The key to a happy life is to first be secure and have peace with yourself.  Trying to make yourself something you're not is not the way to do it.  

* Talk to us on here.  Ask questions.  Challenge your beliefs and the likely religious and heteronormative values of your upbringing.

* Seek a therapist or counselor.  It's OK to do this.  

* Talk to other people with a similar background (like me).  I come from a small farm town of 5,000.  I'm very masculine acting.  I'm white.  I come from an upper middle class family.  I played football in high school (and continued to even after I came out in college).  I hunt.  I play rugby now, and I want to get back into coaching high school football in the next few years.  I want to get married and have kids, and have a nice house.  I can still do all of these things as a bisexual individual.  

* Google, read, look at the qualitative (testimony, interviews, stories) and quantitative research (hard science and statistical data).  

* Explore other sexual and gender identities out there.  Maybe you'll find one that fits your feelings more than the gay identity.  Don't use things like bisexual as a ""negotiation,"" however.  Don't try to be someone you are not.  I am bisexual, but I didn't accept this overnight.  It took a couple years of self reflection.  I thought I was gay, I thought I was straight.  I thought I was bi, I thought I was straight.  I thought I was bi, I thought I was gay.  Once I realized no matter what I like men, women, and other non-binary genders no matter what....no matter how long of a period I liked one gender, I would eventually or still be attracted to another...I realized bisexuality was the identity for me.  

IT'S OK TO BE GAY!  It takes time (years for many), but just be patient and know there are no mandatory social rules you must abide by.  Take some deep breaths, look into a mirror and say you like men.  Say it again, and again and again.  Sometimes one of the biggest keys to self acceptance is just saying who you really are inside out loud.  Self acceptance will not come overnight.  

You're going to be OK, but you need to accept yourself and acknowledge the feelings you have as reality first :).

67,"Your statement that your BF thinks his sex drive died because of his age (27) was a shock to me, age 75.  My sex drive peaked in my 50s and is still fairly strong.  Something is seriously wrong.  Step 1: your BF needs to consult a doctor and then (2) a psychotherapist.  If he refuses you need to move on.  Sex is at the core of a happy life.  Good luck."
68,"&gt; He likes chunky peanut butter and I like creamy

Up until here I thought you two sounded like a really cute couple, then I learned that you're a freak..."
69,"This is a matter of morality and conviction for him, and as such, he's making a judgement of your values. What you have to determine is whether he's a zealot or if you can appeal to him intellectually. 

My husband and I have different moral foundations, but we understand and respect one another, and we have enough intellectual common ground to find peace about those things we disagree. But being in a relationship with a fundamentalist vegetarian would be akin to being an atheist in a relationship with a Pentecostal. "
70,So... Like a *tumor*?
71,"Yeah, it is easy to just say that. You know, I am pretty aware of the fact that I do not love myself, I think most people do. What I am interested in is how could I love myself. How do I achieve this?

Dont get me wrong please, I am sure you post is meant to be positive, I am just so frustated with everything around me. And your post hits just a little too close home."
72,"I would die from overheat, blushing my way out into the gay hell."

74,You're a beast.  I like it.  What's your number so I can text you 20 times.
75,"Sorry, but I don't know if I would help you either.  You're 27 dating and living with a 17 year old.

You are both adults but I think you have to be understanding that other people will not approve and with equally good reason.

As for my advice on this whole situation, just be realistic about what you are getting into.  If you are looking for a lifelong relationship, this probably will not be it.  However, if you are looking for someone to be with for now, enjoy."
76,The dildo can't ever help you move furniture.

78,"It's like basing your identity around a drug, it's some shit sophomores in high school who just started smoking weed do. It's a drug I take, not a main asset of who I am. It's kind of like when lgbt people are overly into being gay and gay culture."

But then again, lots of straight dudes are into wrestling or playing football, so maybe you'd be into it."
88,That is super cute.
89,"The difference between hot and cute for me is. When I say hot I'm planning on putting my dick I'm you and when I say cute I'm planning on cuddling and watching Netflix.

Pillar one, friends/family; pillar two, work or school; pillar three, a hobby, for example perfect body achieved at gym for a lot of guys; pillar four, maybe a boyfriend; pillar five, some other hobby or skill, say French. 

The more pillars you build up, the better and more stable your temple. The problems happen when you only have one or two things going on in your life. If they fall, your whole life collapses. 

Build up your temple and you'll find you start to appreciate yourself a lot more, and might not even need a boyfriend. I know this sounds stupid but I used to be you too"

99,"Don't feel bad. 

I suspect you're aware that unaccepting LDS parents have been responsible for some of the most horrendous abuse of LGBT children ever, by forcing them into conversion programs. It's not an accident that the troubled teen industry is centered in/around Utah. 

You did/said what you think you needed to to keep yourself safe, and you should continue doing that, as long as necessary. 

You can still take care of yourself in the meantime, and your message indicates you're doing that. 

2 things to be aware of:

There's a small but vibrant and growing network of affirming LDS ""mama bears"" who are making real headway in reducing suicides among LGBT kids in the church (and ex). I don't know any personally, but they've been covered in the media more recently so you can probably locate one. They not only help kids in need, they also help the parents deal with their own issues in a way that doesn't devastate their children. 

Second, there's a great book you may want to read yourself in preparing for coming out called ""Mom, I'm Gay"" by Susan Cottrell. Susan's website, FreedHearts.org, is a great resource for parents/family struggling to balance their beliefs and their love for LGBT kids. Check it out. "

111,"Are you seeing it through your own lens and presuming they don't want to see it because it makes them uncomfortable, or is it just because the subject matter is irrelevant to them? For example, I'd have zero interest in seeing a movie made in India about Indian folks doing Indian things, which doesn't make me racist, it just makes me indifferent to the idea of seeing a movie for which I have no interest or frame of reference.

125,"How is his home life?

When I was like 14, I was in band and there was this girl that played the clarinet. She was really fat, nobody liked her, and she would fall asleep during class even with the whole band playing music. One day, another kid started a ""petition"" to get her kicked out of class because she was lazy and wasn't pulling her weight (no pun intended). Almost everyone signed it, and they gave it to the teacher.

The next day, the girl wasn't there. The teacher pulled out the petition and lambasted the class for writing it. She explained that it's horrible to assume that she was falling asleep because she was lazy. We have no idea what might be going on at home. Some kids don't get fed or have a place to sleep, and we had no right to make assumptions about this girl. The teacher was genuinely angry.

That moment taught me to never judge someone by one action, but to look at what might be causing that action. If your BF is falling asleep, there is likely a good reason for it. Maybe his home is high stress and you're the only person he feels comfortable with, which allows him to relax? Maybe it's medical? You never know unless you discuss it. Don't approach it like a bad thing, and don't make it about you or your relationship. He likes you. You like him. Be compassionate."
126,"I'm pretty oblivious frankly. It's best to just be direct or make a move on me. 

The only regret I have is a guy in high school seemed, looking back, to really be pushing for us to do something but I wasn't aware how I felt at the time, about guys. So I let it all zip right past me. I'd like a do over on that so I could do him. :)"

141,"&gt; He is 50 pounds heavier than I am and is trained in martial arts and I am small and skinny.

This part made me think that you were actually scared to the point of thinking if you could defend yourself. If he really freaked you out I would say trust your gut feeling on this and reconsider if you'd want to continue the relationship. If you think he's not dangerous and want to continue seeing him, have a very serious talk with him about what happened and what you want and don't want in sex. Make it very clear that this cannot happen again. If he is not understanding or this happens again against your will, dump his ass immediately."
142,"&gt; Zero risk of pregnancy

That's literally the only advantage we have."
143,They would be convinced that their gay friends secretly want them.
144,"While I think OP meant well, it's a load of bullshit. You're conflating being single, being alone, and psychological issues.

1. People with low self-esteem, people suffering from depression, or those with social anxiety and so on NEED people around them to get them out of their bubble of isolation. Psychological issues like depression are a poison for the mind that prevents the person from taking the first step without considerable effort, and very few are able to do it by themselves. Telling that person ""You have to love yourself!"" means absolutely nothing, you're not helping that person at all by saying that, he already knows, he's just not able to. 

2. Humans are social creatures. Although we may love having some alone time, spending too much time alone is bad for our minds. Even some social animals are not immune to self-destructive behaviors if they are isolated for too long. Humans need social interaction to survive. Some people may need less than others, but they need it nonetheless. Spending too much time alone puts a person's mental well-being at risk, and that person may also lose some important social skills if it goes on for too long.

3. Being single and happy does not mean loving yourself and being happy alone. Singlehood brings a certain degree of freedom that a person in a relationship does not have, but it does not mean being ""alone"". They have friends, they can hang out with other people, visit bars and meet new people, etc. Sure some people whose relationship just ended might need to relearn how to enjoy certain activities by themselves, but that's part of the grieving process. "
145,"Master loves that i greet Him at the door naked and on my knees then kiss His bulge.

He also loves it when i beg for His cock."
146,I admit i used to hate that until i was balls deep into a college professor and he said that. I came instantly
147,"&gt;After we became boyfriends, he made me some tea once, and after I finished it, he asked me if it tasted good. I said ""sure, it's nice"" and he smiled and said he put a little of his own c*m in it. I felt a little violated (am i being silly?) Now everytime he makes something for me, I don't feel like I can trust it 100%.

You're not being silly, that's fucking gross. He nutted in your tea!

edit: grammar"
148,"Aww.  Really, lady?"
149,I think the whole conversation is stupid tbh
150,"Just let him say what he has to say, and try to be understanding, even if you're shocked.

Also: He may not be gay. He might be gay. But he could be bi. Or trans. (That wish for a total reset on how he looks might point in that direction. Likewise for knowing at age 6.) Or he might tell you something completely different. You won't know until you talk to him.

How religious is he, BTW? That might give you a sense of what issues he may be likely to be upset about.

Oh--and does your brother know you're gay?"
151,Animal sacrifice really gets me going.
152,"I've heard the latter a lot cause I don't fit the stereotype of a gay guy. I've had friends say that, but then I ask them ""What do you think of the guys I date?"" They usually answer that they're fine too. Then why did you say you like me cause I'm the exception when you like other guys who aren't? People are fine with their prejudices until they have to try and explain them.

The most popular neutralization of prejudice is ""I was just raised that way."" I spent a lot of time with my grandparents as a child. I didn't know until the age of 12 that chinks was a derogatory term for Asians. I just thought that's what they were called since that was what my grandparents called them. Once I learned it was an insult, I fucking stopped. Yes, you can grow up in an environment that fosters prejudice. However, at a certain point it stops being an excuse. You should learn through experience your way out of that prejudice. Problem is, many people all over the world never live in a diverse enough area to be exposed to people different from them. It's why rural or isolated areas in progressive states tend to be just as fucked up as those in conservative states. Eastern Washington State and Upstate New York are known for being homophobic and racist. [This study looks at Google searches by region.](http://wivb.com/2015/05/05/study-says-western-new-york-is-one-of-the-most-racist-in-the-country/) Western New York State has the highest concentration of racist searches. It ain't just the South people.

Another bull shit thing I hear to justify it, is people saying ""I'm sick of having it thrown in my face on TV/online/etc. all the time."" Or, ""I'm sick of them asking for special rights."" They like us fine when we're out of sight, out of mind, as well as when we're not demanding we be treated equally."
153,"Jealous?  Not a bit.  At least gay guys usually *want* sex.  All I hear from straight guys is how they don't get enough action.  Lots of guys don't even do anal anyway.

Plus there's that whole time of the month thing with women..."
154,"Been together for 11 years and have never done it. He simply cannot stomach the idea. It just turns him off and if it's mentioned, he freezes, goes limp, and gets this panicked look in his eyes and like a cornered animal (it's kind of endearing...). He had some medical issues in the past, and I understand that it is territory that I need to avoid for his sake.

He's offered to bottom if I absolutely can't live without it, but I see no point in that if it doesn't bring him pleasure or joy. Anyhow, if we did do it, he'd totally be a top and a freaking amazing one at that. He's physically built perfect for it (@&amp;#%!!!). He knows how to move his body. He is fit as hell, has great stamina, and he takes direction and acts on it with laser precision. It would be mind-blowingly good.

As it turns out, not getting it actually works in my favor. It's a little piece of him that's just out of reach. I can fantasize about it and it keeps him interesting. For some reason, I never think about anal when we're having sex. Sucking his dick and touching his body is more than satisfying to me. When he's gone, that's when I get lost in imagining it. Basically, it's not a factor unless I'm jacking off to it.

It's been my experience that a happy relationship and a satisfying sex life can exist without anal sex. The most important thing is to find a partner who is on the same page as you. I was willing to give it up completely because the benefits infinitely outweighed the drawbacks. Hookups may be about advertising your role and finding the right match, but spending your life with someone involves compromise and collaboration. "
155,You mean an ideal happy life?
156,"""Bye, I love you""  
""Haha ok, bye""

""So I told this girl I'd had a gay experience""  
""Haha how awkward, that must have made it hard for you to hook up with her""

in my defense teenagers are stupid and I was one.

Also I was trying to moderate my every thought and deed to disguise myself from a world I thought would destroy me.

168,"So about 6 months ago, husband saw a vintage watch he fell absolutely in love with. Turns out it was already reserved for someone else. He was very bummed about it, and still to this day reminisces the watch and how he missed out.

Little did he know, I went back to the store the next day and gave the owner my private info. Told him if the watch situation changes to give me a call. Well, the person who had it on reserve never paid for it! So, the watch is mine. Can't wait to see the look on hub's face when he gets it :)  "

Just about done with Season 5 now (not watching them in order) and I loved it. It actually had a lot more going on than what All Stars 2 felt like. "
