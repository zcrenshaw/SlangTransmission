0,Give up your baby sitting job and find a mature guy to have a relationship with.
1,"They're doing anything and everything to get eyes on them. Thing is, I think they're hurting their cause. Yes, they have legitimate griefs. However, go bust up a trump rally. Go protest at a police department. Go March in the streets. Go have some sit ins.

Breaking up pride is like picking a fight with your friend. We want to see the best happen for you, but when you do shit like this, we kinda don't want to interact with you.

They busted up a bernie sanders event way back when. Sanders marched with mlk and organized protests in the 60s. He's not the guy to fight on this. Not to mention, when they do things like this, they don't let anyone else talk. They won't have a debate. They won't do anything but yell. I'm sorry, but most people are going to tune you out when they see you as obnoxious, and yelling all the time.

They're making civil disobedience look like a bad thing. Have some sit ins. More importantly, organize on the local and state level. Help elect some people who are going to change the system, rather than just saying the system is broken.

That's just my 2 cents. I'm sure someone will say km out of touch. I've been around poor people, and I've been around the police. There's 2 sides to every story. Yes the police need to be reigned back in, but don't lump them all in one group like BLM is complaining about having done to them. The culture in one police department can be severely different than the next. You may work for one sheriff who is a racist piece of shit in this county, then get another job across the state with a guy who doesn't tolerate that shit.

Not everything is as clear cut as either side wants you to think it is.

I rambled. Point is, they're not helping themselves with this action. They anger their allies, and ostracize people who could've been swayed to helping."
2,Just don't let him find out. Nothing is weird or fucked up if no one knows about it.
3,"Their inability to look at a guy and recognize that they're good looking without getting weird. Like I look at women and go, man she's real pretty all the time and it's not weird. "
4,"Anyone who behaves arrogantly toward waiters, bartenders, store clerks, etc. Run away fast."
5,"If you find it demeaning call him out on it. You should know how you want someone to talk about you and the amount of respect you deserve.

Just tell him ""dont talk about me like that with your friends so you can fit in"" and leave it at that. "

10,If your niece is old enough to be asking if you have a girlfriend then she is old enough to be told you have a boyfriend. Your sister is forcing you back in the closet by asking you to lie about your relationship. That doesn't sound very supportive to me.
11,"Pizza guys of Reddit, do you ever stick your dick through a pizza and surprise the person who ordered it and not get arrested for sexual assault? "
12,I ate two big macs with a large fries and coke in one sitting. 
13,Racism. 
14,"I'll break the ice here - of course he's just starving for attention but to monger anti-lgbt sentiments and fake violence, (as a foreigner invited to a conference in America) in the immediate wake of Orlando is beyond tasteless and insulting. "

16,"PSA: Hating BLM does not mean you hate black people. Hating BLM does not mean you deny racism in the criminal justice system. Hating someone's solution **DOES NOT** mean you are denying the problem. 

fuck BLM. Selfish spoiled children, nothing more. "
17,"hi there. first things first: this was not your fault. nothing that you did made it ok for that guy to do things to you that you did not want. rape is never justified. it is absolutely not your fault.

now, onto the more immediate thing: please go to the emergency room. tell them that you need PEP (post exposure prophylaxis). as you mentioned, you're not sure if the man was positive and you can't take that chance. PEP, if taken within 72 hours of the incident, significantly decreases your chances of contracting HIV. 

whatever you do, please do not wait longer than 72 hours after the incident to go to the emergency room. if you want to tell your parents first about this incident and that you need to go to the emergency room, that's fine. just make sure to go as soon as possible.

remember: (1) this is absolutely not your fault. nothing you did made it ok for the man to rape you. (2) go to the emergency room as soon as possible, and no later than 72 hours after the rape incident. the sooner you receive the treatment, the more effective it is

Edit: now that the immediate stuff is posted, i'm gonna add more stuff that you may have to deal with later.

* forget the dude's threats. tell the police. at the hospital, while you're being treated, they'll probably ask you if you came in because you were sexually assaulted or raped. please tell them the truth. you don't have to, and it's totally up to you how to handle it. but you may have some peace of mind that once the police are involved, there can be some action done against the guy who did this to you and that this will, in turn, give you some protection from the guy. once you tell the nurse or doctor at the emergency room, they'll probably either bring in a social worker or just call the police directly. either way, if you have pictures of him from grindr, save them on your phone, as well as the conversation you had with him. it may help with the investigation

* your parents. they don't know you're gay, but they will have to get involved in this. it's probably not how you imagined coming out to them, but you'll need their support now. if you believe they will still support you and love you through all this (even if they might be overwhelmed or not accepting of your sexuality at first), please include them. i know not all parents are like this, but many parents would rather help their child instead of find out later that their child was hurt but didn't feel comfortable enough to tell them what happened. if you believe they'll flip a shit and disown you, then this decision may be harder for you. you may feel like not informing the police about this and keeping this whole incident a secret from your parents may be the better option, but if you feel like your parents will be there for you through all this to any degree, then please tell them.

* again, most important and time-sensitive: go to the emergency room and ask for PEP (post exposure prophylaxis)

best of luck. i hope you feel better"
18,"*Very*. Straight women can be really annoying in gay bars. They get way too excited and handsy. But when you think about it they're surrounded by all this well groomed cock which must be kind of exciting, but at the same time there's this absence of any sexual threat so the whole experience plays havoc with their vaginas. It's like being in a zero calorie cake shop. "
19,If he is in a relationship
20,"I don't know how to put compation in words well, but I'd hug you now. The way you described his abscense in your last paragraph hit me and I'm so sorry about your friend. No one deservs to have such a great friend taken away from you like that."
21,It's just LGBT
22,"Use of the term ""sapiosexual"" in their profile. 

I, too, like to talk to smart people. But Christ, what a pretentious fucking way to say it."
23,"I see just ignore BLM completely and let the movement die out. 

They started off with a great idea everyone could get behind (bringing attention to police brutality against black people) and absolutely destroyed it with their actions. I know people who are now pretty racist thanks to BLM and their shit. "
24,I got a letter from an owl when I turned 11.
25,"The secret here is the ""princess"" was jealous. That's how young gay culture works. He was trying to prevent the hipster from looking at you. Most likely he full well knows you are not 12 and you triggered as a cute threat to his territory. Take it as a compliment and find the hipster if you are interested."

Well, for me it's definitely smoking. 

You light that cigarette and you have gone from 100 to 0 for me. "
31,"I'm really sorry this happened to you. And to be honest, cheating on someone is the best way to let a partner know that you couldn't care less about them.


You can ""forgive"" him, but you don't need to forget about this. I don't blame you for kicking him out either. I would not want him in my environment. That has to be toxic.


*To make the pain go away?* Time, which is the worst antidote we have. It takes to long and you always lose faith in it. But you will move past this, depending on how you maturely you handle this."
32,"Most straight men regulate their behavior according to 2 main rules: 

1) Not doing what women do

2) Not doing what gay men do

Acknowledging the attractiveness of another man violates both rules. "
33,"I honestly don't understand how anyone could tell the difference between demisexuality and a low libido, and the latter seems like a much more plausible explanation. To me, claiming to be demisexual sounds a bit like saying you can't be hungry unless you're friends with the chef.

Maybe I'm just being pedantic, but it seems like there's a huge difference between ""*I have never experienced sexual attraction outside of a romantic relationship*"" and ""*I am physiologically incapable of experiencing sexual attraction outside of a romantic relationship*""."

38,Sounds like you debunked the 'science' of no-fap...
39,"Definitely NOT. If you all are serious about your criticism of BLM-To then enacting petty revenge makes you exactly like them. 

And one other thing, don't pretend to care about homophobia in the black community just so you can stick it to BLM. The homophobia that gay PoC face isn't some prop you can use for your own gain. 

Seriously?"
40,"You should definitely give it a try. Put huge guardrails on things you will and won't accept, but you have a kid together. That's enough to merit a try in my book.

Edit: it's not like your ex did something horrific, he had a dumb expectation and acted poorly, but it isn't like he hurt your son or cheated on you or stole your money for drugs.

If you don't give it a try, won't you be asking yourself if you should have, for a very long time? What's the worst that could happen?"
41,"Well recently there was a gay guy at some pride festival who gave a speech because he claimed to be at Pulse when the shooting happened but his story fell apart under basic questioning after the speech.

I thought that was pretty twisted (and perhaps indicative of some sort of compulsive lying, etc.)."
42,"I met my long time SO on an online writing class that I was helping grade and stuff. That's a long story but I ended up tutoring this one guy because he refused to just write the paper and had to turn it into a story. I totally loved all of his story papers but they weren't what the head teacher wanted. So while tutoring him, he tried really hard to get to know me and at first I thought it was because he thought I was in charge of his grade.

Over time though I realized that I really liked getting to know him too. This was all over online. In person I was a mute so talking through text online was the only way I could communicate with him. I had always fallen a little to easily but this guy was something else.

Eventually it came up that I was an English major and liked to write books. He asked to read one and nervously I agreed. They are all coming of age, clean gay romance / paranormal and magical realism things. I was scared that he would think the gay thing was weird. But a couple weeks later I got a PM from him that said, and I quote:

""This is the cutest bullshit I have ever read and I absolutely love it. How dare you make me have feelings for you and these stupid cute book characters. If you're this romantic in real life, I'd die happy knowing that I was married to you.""


I had NO IDEA how to respond to that but he saw that I had read the message and that I was just sitting there. So he followed it up with:


""Hey...When did you realize that you were gay? Is it normal for it to take 18 years?""


And the rest is history. I'm proud to say that I am going to marry that one."
43,"Size queens. I don't care if you are at 10/10 if you ask me how hung I'm an or if I have a ""good dick"" you won't get a answer. I don't want to fuck your black hole."
44,"I don't know when it first started. But lately it's just how disrespectful coworkers or even friends are to their girlfriends or wives. They've just internalized those sexist media stereotypes of women being needy or women's problems not being ""real"" or joking about their intelligence or that they're self-obsessed. Like what the fuck, I'd never say any of that about my boyfriend. "

55,"How I was never in a rush to get a girlfriend. I was just looking at my watch wondering: ""okay when is it supposed to kick in!?"""
56,"Well, aside from some threesomes that ""went wrong"" *afterward* (due to the manifestation of unexpected-but-entirely-predictable feelings of jealousy, regret, whatever -- which makes for boring, boring stories), there was this one time about ten years ago that was kind of a disaster:  

I was at the beach (one of those gay beach towns) and ran into a gentleman that I would get together with from time to time back home.  He invited me to join him and another guy back at his beach house and it seemed like a good idea at the time.  His bedroom in this house was actually not a real bedroom, but rather the back porch.  It had been ""renovated"" by the owners so they could rent the house as a four-bedroom, but it was really just a glass-enclosed back porch with a bed in it.  So we're in there, doing the things one does in such situations, and everything is going well enough.  

At one point, the other dude stands up on the bed leaning back against the headboard/windows.  I was facing him down at the other end of the bed, and my time-to-time fb was in between us, both of us inside him.  Anyway, other dude must have been having a real nice time up there, because at one point he kind of threw his head back - and it went right through the window.  

Somehow, he managed not to cut himself (curtains, I suppose).  He seemed a little dazed, and I took this development to have ended our session (or at least to have pushed the pause button on it).  My time-to-time fb, however, shouted ""no, don't stop"" and the other dude kind of nodded, so we completed our situation.  Once things settled down, we assessed the window damage and started to clean up a little bit.  

I went off to the kitchen to grab some paper towels, and when I came back into the room, I see my fb picking up glass shards on the floor and the other dude - for some reason - is trying to break out the pieces of glass that are still in the window frame.  Then he cuts his hand.  Badly.  He screams.  Then my fb looks up just in time to catch a spray of blood in his face.  Other dude can't handle ""gore"" (i don't think a cut up hand and some blood spatter actually qualify as such, but that's the word he used and it seemed unnecessary to quibble over it at the time).  Anyway, other dude, as an involuntary response to seeing ""gore"" just suddenly vomits all over himself, and the bed, and my fb.  

My fb gets up, screaming, and promptly slips on whatever ungodly potion of bodily fluids is pooled on the floor.  He, of course, falls and cuts himself (not too badly) on broken glass.  They are both screaming.  A lot.  Two of my fb's housemates wander back to see what all of the fuss is and find two people covered in blood and vomit screaming and me standing there with some paper towels and a bottle of 409 cleaner.  One of them screamed, the other laughed. 

Eventually, everyone stopped screaming and I took both the fb and the other dude to the hospital.  The triage nurse clearly knew there was more to the story but didn't press it.  They were both fine, I think the other dude got a handful of stitches.

Anyway, that's my ""threesome gone terribly wrong"" tale.  I still consider it a pretty fun night on balance.  Never saw the other dude again (he lived in a different city), but the fb and I still run into each other around town.  "

I don't know what the fuck to say. "
71,Remember when I said this type of thing is fucked up and everyone downvoted me?
72,"This is wildly abnormal. Biologically, you should only be attracted to one person at a time, even if you just met that person a few minutes prior for your date. The way you know you've found true love is, once you meet that person, you never want to look at another attractive guy again, ever, until you're dead. 

Just kidding - you're a totally normal little slutbag. Welcome to the club. Embrace it. But keep in mind that lots of people you'll encounter while dating hate themselves and have delicate egos that cannot tolerate even the slightest perceived challenge to their self-esteem without reacting with self-righteous shaming of others who aren't ashamed of their sexuality. 

Be a good date - focus on your date, but don't hide who you are, as that will inevitably lead to disappointment. If you're on a date with someone who gets ruffled because you're flirty, it's best you learn that about each other up front."

77,"&gt;Right after we first kissed he posted on facebook, ""When a cute boy kisses you and you think maybe you deserve to live.""

Aaaahahaha ruuun bitch. Thats the kind of shit you only publish on Facebook if you are a batshit psycho attention whore. Like 80% of the human population deals with depression or self image issues at some point or another. You can vent to friends and family, deal with it in therapy, or suffer in silence, but people who so flagrantly flaunt their issues will use them as a crux to try to control you. 

This is going to be tough to disentangle from. After you break things he will probably write some emo 15 year old ""OMG I KNEW BOYS COULDN'T BE TRUSTED I GUESS ILL KILL MYSELF UNLESS I GET 30 LIKES"" shit. Just ignore it and if he grows up and deals with his own emotions you can hang out like regular humans."

80,"He's an attention whore. Even if his friends truly do have photos of the attackers, I sincerely doubt the LAPD is going to lie about this one. There's nothing for them to gain.

Plus, several people saw him steal liquor from the club and vandalize cars, which he was arrested Monday for the latter.

This is the kind of guy who deserves a good bit of public embarrassment. He deserves to lose every follower he's got.

Edit: misused word."
81,I'd be pissed. Love is grounded in respect. I don't call people I respect or love 'bitch'. He is clearly trying to build himself up and shore up his own masculinity at your expense. That's not cool.
82,"And I think he used America as his backdrop because I've seen quite a few Europeans paint the US as some sort of backward hellhole where gay bashing is a required rite of passage for straight people, like getting a drivers license. Meanwhile Europe is a perfect sanctuary, a shining city on a hill where no evil exists.

Attention whores are gonna whore for attention I guess…"

99,"After years of avoiding it because I didn't want to get hooked or anything, the relentless combination of enduring loneliness and seething horniness has made me decide to FINALLY get it just the other day.

Immediate impression: It's super dehumanizing. I mean it's literally a giant menu of guys you can pick and choose like some kind of meal that could be delivered right to your door. 

Now you want sex, I get it, so do I. It's just the treatment of people here, especially by fellow users, that's the problem. You got your racism, you got your liars, you got your desperate weirdos who send disturbing messages but won't take the hint you're uncomfortable (yes, I witnessed all of this in just 2 damn days). If I could say one thing to most Grindr users, it's this: People are NOT objects and you are NOT entitled to their bodies. Have a little self-respect, Jesus.

It also might seem like a good place to find dates (and in some places it is), but you really need to know what you're doing and be ready for anything because most guys on there are either looking for a fuck or two or three, or they might date you but then immediately drop you when they see a better ass. Yes I know there are successful relationships from this site, but for every 1 of those stories, you got 100s of guys meeting up and it ended up going nowhere. If it's dates you want, there are better seas to fish out there.

But not all sucks on Grindr (or does it?). I've still managed to chat with some very cool guys and make a couple friends and even a date or two. It's actually also kinda cool to see all these local guys, I never realized how many gays we got here. Of course, lots of these profiles are clearly bogus or use fake pics (how is it 75% of Grindr pics are super-toned dudes when 75% of the general population is considered obese?), but you just gotta weed them out and keep alert. 

So...I honestly don't know. I see now how and why it's done a lot of harm, but there's still some success stories to be had. We just need to fight this tide of dehumanization, I don't really know how to other than suggest we all try to be a little more patient and respectful because don't forget that this app is specifically geared towards letting you enter someone's personal space and them getting into yours. That's a vulnerable place and one where a LOT of hurt has happened and will continue to happen. 

Just always remember that there is still a PERSON on the other side."
100,"So sorry. I couldn't imagine this happening to any of my friends.  

You should consider a therapist to talk about your feelings, if you haven't already. I know it's cliche advice but they're trained to listen and help you out. It's best to go sooner than later.  

Hope you feel ok soon, dude"
101,"If he doesn't know who you are, he just might have matured into a nice guy. 

If you truly have put it behind you, you have no reason not to give him a chance. But I'm sensing some resentment here.

You have history but maybe, just maybe that can be a good natured joke between you two . (Eg. You used to stuff me in a locker, now I'm stuffing your ass, hehehe)

So, if you like the person he's become, give it a try. It may also be someone else entirely. You'll never know if you don't take a chance. 

Meet in public though."
102,"Let me offer a counterpoint. I wasn't on r/gaybros back when it was apparently different but I have been been reading it for a while. 

Two things:
1) People are different and that's okay. 
2) Sometimes there isn't enough space for everyone.

How would you feel if you went to a gay bar and saw lots of straight people there. Maybe there are some obnoxious ones making out in front of you but let's say most are just there talking and having a good time. You then complain that you went there to spend time in your element, be around other gay guys, and maybe find a cute one for yourself. But 90% of the people there are straight. It's hard to filter through all the people who have no interest in you before you can find one who does. 

Maybe this is what the complainers are talking about. They're different. Their interests are  different. Not wrong, just different. Not a problem, we say, but then we don't give them a space to talk sports and guns and such without having to filter through dozens of posts about _insert trendy gay topic here_  And so they go out to start their own space, like r/gaybros, for example, where they can do just that. However, over time they realize that there are more and more people talking about stuff that isn't relevant to them. They now have to filter through lots stuff to find what used to be the main focus of the sub. Even more, when they bring it up, they're just told that the sub is big enough for everyone and asked why they have to be so closed off.

Idk... This got longer than I thought it'd be so I'll end it soon but I also wanted to make a distinction between people wanting a space for themselves and claiming a name for themselves. It kind of seems like some people there's an idea floating around that only people who like the things that old gaybros used to talk about can be considered gaybros. That's not what I was talking about above"

Complete lack of anything to talk about. You've gotta have some interests. ""What do you like?"" .... ""I don't know."" FUCK!

Excessive religion. I'm not trying to convert you to being an atheist, I'm not going to sit there and let you try to talk me into going back to the church. Worst date of my life involved a guy talking to me about how Jesus loved all of us, and that includes me. News flash: I don't give a fuck.

Beards. I'm not a beard guy, especially the civil war beards."
106,"So nobody can force you to buy into the drunken, slutty, over the top mess that is ""stereotypical"" gay culture. I don't.

But dismissing the drag movement, rainbow flags, Pride, and general gay visibility is like being proud you don't vote, because people vote for selfish reasons. The reason society has even come this far, even though we're nowhere near close to equal, is because drag queens, flamboyant gay boys, and other gay guys that refused to be silent forced gay rights to be an issue and got beat up, ostracized, and sometimes murdered for their pains.

Part of the reason Orlando is such a hot issue is because people are absolutely refusing to acknowledge the POSSIBILITY that somebody killing a club full of gay guys could be gay related. You can be fired in 29 states if your employer finds out you're homosexual. Blending into the background simply isn't an option if you want to get anywhere near equal rights.

In short, you're reaping the benefits of flaming homosexuals who have put in the footwork so you can be a non stereotypical masculine gay while dismissing them.

That's an odd statement to inject into your post. Where did that come from?"
107,I find queer more insulting than fag tbh.
108,"Adult stuff? Lame excuse for being secretly homophobic. Being gay is not just about sex (I suppose this is what she's referring to 'adult stuff'?), thinking of it this way is no less homophobic than saying out loudly you're not equal.

122,"My first boyfriend met me in English 101 in my freshman year of community college. I got caught staring apparently. He had a friend of his watch me while he pretended to be interested in something across the room. She said ""yup. He wants the D.""

I come into class one morning, and he's already there. I usually got there early, but he was super early. I sit my bag down on the desk, apparently knocking something off I later learning. He starts going ""PSSSSSST! You dropped something."" And pointed to the ground next to me. It's a small, folded up, square piece of paper.

I pick it up, kind of wondering wtf this is. As soon as I open it all the way, and start to read the thing, I realize what's going on. I read it slowly, enjoying each word. I'm smiling, my hearts beating super fast.

He has his friend watching me, asking how I'm reacting. She told him that I seemed to be taking it well. The note said he wasn't sure if I was gay, but I seemed nice and he'd noticed me notice him. He mentioned that my paper was on gay marriage, so he was just wondering. If he was wrong, he said please don't get mad.

I wanted to keep him in some suspense, so I folded it up and put it in my pocket.

As soon as class finished, I stood and walked over to him. I said, ""you guess correctly. I'll text you sometime today or tomorrow.""

We dated off and on from then till now. Right now, we're off. We're probably not going to get back together anymore. Best ass ever."
123,"This is obviously not serious. I am clearly demonstrating that the inverse is unacceptable so the original is too.

140,"As far from what I've been reading on /r/toronto, while people were originally complaining about having to wait for 3 hours in the sun because they had no idea what the fuck was going on, later on they did found out about BLM's requests.

**The biggest complaint was BLM wanting police exclusion from the Pride events** - taking out their presence (thus, security) and also their float participation.

2. First take care of yourself and set your boundaries. For the foreseeable future, this guy is ""someone you used to know."" Right now you need to grieve the loss you've experienced and learn to live with your new normal.
3. Love means supporting another person and trying to put their needs before your own. He may think he loves you, but his actions prove he's wrong. He probably just feels affectionate towards you and comfortable with you. But he used you. That's not how you demonstrate love.
4. Be sure to get a full panel of STD tests soon, and mention to your health care provider that you slept with a man who has sex with men (they'll likely want to include some extras that straight women aren't as likely to be exposed to)."
156,Honestly - *nobody cares* what you look like in the gym. Come to my gym. It's *not* full of muscled hotties. Old ladies - very overweight people - women working out in *full hijab*. All human life is there and nobody gives a damn what they look like. If you can't build muscle (and not everyone can without a really massive amount of effort) why not just focus on getting fit? A slim fit healthy looking body is way hotter than one that has a load of muscle forced on to it. IMO some bodies suit big muscles - some don't.

Oh, and gender neutrality isn't terrifying to me. I just think it's dumb."
168,"&gt; My message to that sub, and this one as well, is that these are not the kind of divisions we should live behind.

Not all gay people are obligated to be friends with or associate with you or anyone else just because you or they are gay too. 

We may all be gay and all support the cause, but for many that's not enough to have in common to be friends or associates with each other. Many gays have more than being gay or gay related things going for them while others have nothing but being gay 24/7 going for them.

Gay is a sexual orientation, not a little girl slumber party."

173,"You were sharing a bed during an intimate vacation. If anything, this just goes to show you guys have a very deep level of comfort with one another.

Don't sweat it too much, but if you feel something more there, let him know. The act itself isn't too much to get overworked by, though. Glad you had a good time!"
174,"I always thought of it as with a guy I would admire from afar but never really speak to. We would always catch the other one at random places and give that awkward nod or smile.

We would notice each other, start laughing, and introduce ourselves. We'd chat about everything and realize we actually had a bunch of stuff in common.
