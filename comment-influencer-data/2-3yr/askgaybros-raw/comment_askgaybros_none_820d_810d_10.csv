1,"&gt;And I don't know if anyone actually to read graphic details about my sexcapades.

Yeh we all *hate* graphic sexcapade details. "
2,"Without getting too political... I think this group is unreasonable and ridiculous. I recognize that there is police brutality in our world , but most police officers are just trying to do their job and get home to their families. To interrupt a celebration of LGBT pride to make an anti-police statement is really unreasonable. There are much better avenues for them to express their concerns than this.  Exercise your first amendment rights but don't shit on our parade. "
3,"(Not intended to be racist or anything) The colours don't match at all, looks like shit. There's no brown in the rainbow last I checked. "
4,"Be ready to gather all evidence. I suggest you make sure to record any phone calls your family makes, saving all facebook messages, texts and etc. This way you might be able to get protection in case you feel like your life is endangered. "
5,Damnit clap. You and these emojis
6,"I think it's a personality thing, but it also has a lot to do with culture, upbringing, etc. I'm very chill about it just like you, but I've been out since I was a child. I was born to a secular family and never really had to hide this part of me. 

My buddy on the other hand had a very religious upbringing and had to fight tooth and nail for the right to just be acknowledged as a human being by his family and everyone around him. He always makes it a point to be as gay as possible, goes to Pride, etc.

I imagine that a lot of folks wear it like a badge of honor because they had to fight for and earn the right to be openly gay. "

11,"&gt;How did you end up bottoming the first time?

The guy I was dating was progressing with me very slowly, because I was easy to scare, but at some point he let me feel his rock hard boner through his pants and told me to caress it. I was fascinated, because it was my first ~~*real*~~ time when I was touching someone's dick. When I was playing with his meaty toy, he was telling me that he wants to fit it inside of my ass, that he was going slowly to not scare me away, but he's a real man and he has his needs that I have to satisfy as his cute boy, blah, blah, blah... (◔◞◔)

&gt;What drives you to be bottom only?

I love it mostly because I'm very submissive and I just love the idea of being this cute, weak, innocent boy who needs love, affection and cuddling, and who gets it from his ""real alpha male"", but at the same time has to pay for this honor by giving up his own ass and dignity, by letting the dom breed, torment and play with his body, whenever he wishes. (\*ﾟｰﾟ\*)ゞ

^(I know that both - sub and dom - needs sex as well as affection, but it's just hot to think otherwise, at least in terms of sex. It just such a sweet mixture of innocence and lust...)

Also, I love the sensation. It always feels like I'm close, but I can't reach the orgasm. I love it. It makes me feel desperated, frustrated, angry, sad, but at the same time I'm excited, satisfied and happy, because I pleased my partner. The tornado of emotions... ＜(。_。)＞"

Literally had to stop a friend from saying this. Cause I date those kinds of guys. Had a long conversation where I said:

""You met my ex Flim-Flam, right?""

""Yeah...""

""Was he easy to talk to? Did you get along the times you met him?""

""Yeah, but he's one of the good ones.""

*Facepalm.*"
34,"No, I feel awkward around attractive guys though."
35,"I am the complete opposite of you, but I have known guys who were very much like you. It was hard for them to find likeminded partners, but both of them eventually did.

However, I'd like to explain something to you here if I may:

&gt; How do you trust someone who's always enjoyed casual sex if you want monogamy?

These are two completely separate things. A person can enjoy casual sex while they're single and still be 100% monogamous. I'm this way, I went through a period in my life where I simply didn't want to be in a relationship, but I still enjoyed plenty of casual sex. When my husband and I got together, I stopped seeing other guys. I've never strayed, cheating on him is just completely unthinkable to me. I'm *staunchly* monogamous."
36,I have  boner now 
37,"I find this funny because no matter what age you're at, whether low 20s, mid 20s or high 20s... you'll always have this feeling.

I am 27, own a house, live at home, high paying job and probably someone younger will think I have my shit together.

But, then I look at some of my buddies in their low 30s and they are WAY well off than I am, families, house, high paying ass job, world travel etc... and I think they have their shit together.

It's really a never ending cycle"

39,"1. No, that bright-colored shirt does not make you gay. A desire to have sex only with people of the same sex makes you gay.
2. How long have you known you're straight?
3. No, putting anything up your butt does not make you gay, including your proctologist. Unless you're dating your proctologist and he's not a woman; in which case, it's probably gay.
4. I'm not attracted to every guy I see, and I also don't want to have sex with you.

44,"Hey, so this was posted twice in r/gaybros, but now neither post appears on the main feed. I can only view those threads by checking my comment history. I'm not the only one who noticed this. I don't like conspiracy theories, but it kinda feels like it got censored by moderators who didn't like that people weren't clamoring in blind agreement with the flag's introduction. Anyways, I'll say again what I said in both threads: I think this is a scam.

I'm even more confident than I was yesterday that the creators of this flag are only doing this to make money. I don't think this is about inclusion at all. Before the downvotes flood in, allow me to explain why I think that:

[Look at the website for this new flag.](https://morecolormorepride.com/)

Most of that site's interface focuses on marketing and sales. The company they've partnered with, Tierney, is a known marketing firm, and the website's design reflects that. When you visit that site, they're almost immediately asking you for either money or free publicity. This is little more than a glorified ad campaign. If this was really about making PoC feel included, there would be a whole lot more substance to this website. Where are the historical articles about the contributions PoC have made to the LGBT movement? Where are the biographies? Where's the visibility that this flag purports to create? I've looked, and I don't think there's a single picture of a real-life PoC on this entire website. In fact, the site seems to care principally about the flag itself (and promoting it) much more than the PoC it supposedly helps. This is a brand, not a movement. Maybe I'm just cynical, but all I see when I look at their website is a thinly veiled attempt to make money by manipulating peoples' emotions. They throw around a few flowery sentences about racism and inclusiveness, then direct you to their store so that you can pay them to feel better about yourself. This is pretty much tantamount to making money via emotional blackmail.

As many people in the other thread pointed out, LGBT organizations are going to feel pressured to buy and display the new flag. Nobody wants to be perceived as racist, and this flag expertly capitalizes on that sentiment. These people will make a lot of money, I expect, but I doubt it will catch on long term."
45,"&gt;Now the obvious solution would be to tell my friends to cancel the whole thing.

No, the obvious solution is to tell your bf now cause it will only make things worse down the line. It's stupid to give up something fun you are going to do and dig yourself deeper in the hole. Plus, it's downright disrespectful to your friends who are trying to do something nice for you. Sit your bf down and tell him the truth."
46,"Dont disrupt our celebration to shine light on yours. Create your own platform. We are about celebration and inclusivity, not retribution and seperation. Blm from toronto forced our Police to not attend this years pride and I was pretty upset.

Edit: main point: theyve become the very thing they started out to stop and prevent."
47,This had got to be satire.

Don't listen to the people in this thread who at eprobably going to call you a pice of shit or whatever, you're 20 about to be 21, we all are dumb and don't think things through at that age. What makes you a good person is you realized you were caught and stepped up to the plate and admitted the truth. I respect that a lot, says you have a backbone and aren't afraid to admit your fault or mistakes. 

In the future just be honest about shit bro to avoid things like this.

71,"The pride flag has not been redesigned, any more than the American flag has been ""redesigned"" when people add rainbows to it: someone has created a different version of the pride flag, but there is only one pride flag.

Also, the pride flag already includes people of colour, and for me, putting the black and brown at the top of this version, as they did, looks wrong.  Based on the colours they should go at the bottom.  

I doubt this flag will be widely adopted.  "
72,"I have so much straight friends that put too much emphasis on their heterosexuality, they actively search for an opposite sex partner and push for equality in their everyday lives. 

Sounds stupid but yeah. I mean come on. This whole *Im gay but Im not gay gay* bugs me. You do your thing and let others do others. They dont *need* grindr as if its essential for their survival, but it can be hard to find gays in certain areas. Maybe they want a boyfriend, or just a quick shag?

80,"Guy on Tinder 10 miles away (still have never downloaded Grindr yet). Wanted to hook up and I did too. He warned me that he ""wasn't exactly hung"" and I said I didn't care since I'm a top and don't care about dicks that much. I let him know I was newly out and hadn't had gay sex yet and he said that was cute and he'd walk me through it. 

I'm driving over there and he gives me these really creepy instructions. Park a block up the street, walk around to the back of the house (this is like 11pm) and he would let me in the cellar door to the basement. I'm a guy who doesn't really mince words so I just told him that sounded fucking creepy. He said he lives in there and it goes directly to his room and he didn't want his roommates hearing and promised me it was safe. 

Well I feel like I can handle myself so I go anyway and it isn't dangerous lol. He had a nice little bed set up down there and he was kinda cute and we started going at it. We were making out and he was grabbing my dick down my pants and everything and we both got naked. If you remember when he said he ""wasn't exactly hung"" he uh....wasn't lying lol. He had that hypospadias thing too. 

But whatever he starts blowing me and it feels good, I try to blow his tiny little mini wiener appetizer sized dick and wasn't feeling it at all so I stopped lol. He put a condom on me and rode me. That felt AMAZING but then he came in literally like 2 minutes and got off me before I came. He tried to make me cum by blowing me, making out etc. it didn't work but he ended up cumming a second time!! He told me to just jack off then and I couldn't even finish doing that because he was weird and staring at me. So I left without having an orgasm and that is how I lost my virginity. If that even counts I guess. 

I went on a legit date 2 nights later with this great guy that ended up in a hotel room and that was AMAZING sex that made me cum and I wish in hindsight that had been my first time but whatever live and learn and all that shit. "

84,"Yeah, you have to bring it up.  

&gt; We started messaging each other and I asked about his age requirement. He said it was because he's 26 and not interested in dating someone too much younger. He said ideally he would want someone his own age.

&gt; He also said he likes to go to bars and stuff and doesn't want to have to deal with the hassle of dating someone who can't get in.

Explain that he was worth the risk.  You didn't want to lose such a great guy like him over your being a little shy of 21."
85,"I sent this story to my gay, massage-therapist friend for his opinion. 

His response:
&gt;Okay well. I kinda feel like the massage therapist was testing the waters because you can easily do a glute massage without going anywhere near the crack/hole. Sooo, I'm not saying he did it on purpose. But I would guess he was. I also would like to say that if the massage therapist knows what's up he will tell his client he can't treat him anymore but he can invite him over for a more personal, non-professional experience. But if it happens during a treatment it's an abuse, even if OP wants it. But he needs to choose between butt sex and having OP as a client. So yeah, he probably did it on purpose but they need to have different boundaries to keep things kosher."

It's weird; I'm not really attracted to super masc guys. I mean, if they're physically attractive, I'll be turned on, but if their mannerisms are hypermasculine, then I kinda lose interest because I start seeing them as ""straight"" and someone to compete with rather than to fuck. Does that make sense?

The most attractive guys to me strike the right balance between masculine and effeminate. They have at least some effeminate mannerisms, especially the ""song"" in their voice and the more expressive eyes (if that makes sense.)

I'll be honest and say that I don't automatically fall for the guys who like to cross-dress or do stuff like make-up and drag, but it's not a deal breaker for me; in fact, I tremendously respect every person who's brave and confident enough to be themselves."

In the 80s/90s, we were fighting the government and medical industry during the AIDS epidemic.  Up until the mid 2000s, gay men were still getting attacked at a large rate just for walking out of a gay bar.

In 2015...We were fighting against a guy who wouldn't bake a gay wedding cake, or a small town pizza place who wouldn't cater a gay wedding.

In 2017...we are fighting against people who say anti gay stuff on Twitter.  "

133,"When I was a sophomore, I lived in a student house with several of my friends. We were one of those houses where the door was never locked, and there was always a bunch of random people hanging around. I loved it. 

So we would all go out onto the poarch to smoke periodically and one day we noticed some guys had started doing work on the road. They noticed us, we noticed them. A few days went by and the same routine would go on. 

I would go for a smoke, they would be working, and one of them, let's call him Calvin, cause that was his name, would just sort of blatantly stare over in my direction. When I smoked, I smoked a lot, so I was out there frequently and we would just sort of smile at one another. 

Same series of questions arose: was he interested, is this a thing, am I losing my mind by building up some strange pornograpic fantasy? The usual antipsychotic checklist. 

So about four days in, I get into a fight with a boy I was talking to, and it really fucking hurt me because he said some terrible shit to me. All this went down on campus, and the walk/slow jog back home was fucking awful. I held back the crying until I got home, and started heating up some food in the microwave. 

I went upstairs to my bedroom and changed into my ~~wifebeater~~ tanktop and these  sweats that were on my floor. As soon as I changed and went downstairs to grab my food the fuckin water works started. It was just a lot of crap to hear, and I was pretty sensitive in my youth, so the bastard got to me. 

Anyway, I decide to enjoy the fleeting summer days that we had and sat outside, on the poarch. Tears streaming down my face, forkfulls of fried rice being jammed into my mouth. And then he came over. 

In my gloom I hadn't even noticed Cal and his worker buddies putting the final touches on what they had a spent their week working on. He walked up to my poarch and I looked up and smiled at him. You could clearly tell that I had been crying, but I guess the smile made him comfortable enough to kick around and talk. 

He introduced himself, asked what was wrong, I gave him the run down but turned the thing into more of a joke than this dower situation that I didn't want to foist on him. He laughed with me, we talked about the work that he and his buddies were doing. And I just asked bluntly why he came over. 

He said he had overheard our conversations a couple of times (i.e. heard me talking about something gay-related, and deduced that I was a fan of the d), and just wanted to come by and say hi. 

I decided then to say fuck it , and just asked him if he wanted to grab my number and he could give me a call sometime. He did. We said our goodbyes. 

He texted me about an hour later saying that I was much cuter up close and that he was really happy that I gave him my number. I, once again said fuck it, and asked if he wanted to hang out....like now. 

He came back to my place, and that day ended a lot better than it had started out.  "

My bf and the other guy was still asleep so i went to the store and bought some eggs, tortillas and some bread, I then cooked it and my bf woke up and asked me what i was doing.


I told him i'm making breakfast and that he should wake up the guy because its almost done. my bf did that and the other guy looked confused and my bf was nervous and stated serving it. Coffee, milk, eggs, tortillas bread everything was there at the table.


We just started eating and not really talking, the awkwardness was high and i could tell that my bf wanted to leave so fast.


The guy and i started talking and i told him what happened and he ended up laughing it was a good time for all of us. when we where done we all cleaned up the plates and put everything back.

You are processing a lot of feelings dude, it is going to be OK. It is ok to cry, that is your mind and bodies way of responding to emotional challenges. 

You did it! Congratulations! 

You did an amazing life affirming thing by informing her that you are gay and ex Muslim. 

I am gay and ex-Catholic myself...It was hard too. My parents also didn't accept it when I came out. (fifteen the first time). They said all that shit, ""you are confused"", ""If you prayed and really meant it, God would take it away"" and all that crap. 

TRUTH - You are gay, you will be with a guy eventually, and no amount of prayer would help you be any different, and even if you had a girl it wouldn't change shit. 

It is ok for your mom to be wrong. It is ok for her to tell you stupid shit. That is kinda what mom's do. They are using their straight value system to help their child who they see is in crisis. 

They just don't realize that they cause the fucking crisis right??

It is ok that she didn't accept it. YOU STILL TOLD HER! It is fine that she won't say it's ok, SHE STILL KNOWS. It is perfectly acceptable for he to think that God can fix you, YOU STILL CAME OUT. What she thinks doesn't really change anything. You will still be an Ex-Muslim, and a gay one at that. 

Do something very life affirming and pro gay. Speak often to other gay people. Make a gay friend. Just chill about your feelings and so much upheaval right now..That is totally normal when your family finds out what you have been hiding for so long. 

ALL THIS IS SO NORMAL.    It is ok man. You just need to feel the feelings and realize that what she thinks (even though it used to be the guiding force that taught you to walk, eat, think, and live) just isn't going to be that important to your well being, your life going forward. 

You will be who you are. No matter what she thinks. You will be gay, and you will make your way through the world. 

LOVE YOURSELF. You are an amazing guy, with a tremendous bunch of experiences ahead of you. ENJOY each of them. 

I am so sorry she hasn't accepted you. I am 49 and my parents still like yours didn't want this for me. Eventually they had to accept that I would be gay, I would date boys, and eventually, I married another man. You will live your life anyway, and what seems like a non-starter will eventually reconcile. She will eventually come to grips with it. So will you.

188,"Not exactly NSFW, but when using dating apps like Tinder or Grindr: use it when you actually are available/down to fuck/whatever. Don't just use them to kill time and browse.

For example, when you hop on an app (especially Grindr) for the first time you probably experience the ""new meat"" effect to some extent, and get a flood of messages/matches. You can't keep up with them all, but do try to focus on just few people at a time, keep online time to minimum, and intend to meet up if things seem good. Having too many guys/matches at a time keeps you unfocused - you are there looking for a partner, not playing candy crush, remember? Find someone, chat them up, try to meet them soon and see if the chemistry is there IRL.

If you hang online for no reason/swipe matches for fun with no intention to actually follow up, you'll become ""old news"" quickly and those guys you didn't reply to will often mark you off 'as not interested' indefinitely.

Many of us have this bad habit checking our apps every five minutes - apps are addictive like that. We get bored when the matches/messages stop coming in and wonder what's wrong with everyone. Then we think it's awkward to message those guys we ignored/forgot about.

There was a blog post about this and I found the advice very helpful in general. It's embarrassing to admit, but I realized I've been using these apps pretty much 'wrong' from the start."

He liked to cuddle too and we shared the same name. We had both worked using heavy machinery so we had something to talk about. I still have his number and I'm tempted to meet him again (can't cause I'm seeing someone else). 
201,"Seems to me that although sexual incompatibility isn't the only issue affecting your relationship with your husband... it is the main issue.  On one hand it could be argued that your husband is being selfish, and could be more GGG in bed.  It also sounds like he led you along for sometime about this... keeping you hopeful that eventually he would let you fuck him.  But on the other hand... if getting fucked up the ass is something that he just does not want to do, doesn't enjoy, etc. he should not feel pressured to do something sexual that makes him uncomfortable.  So what does that ultimately mean for your relationship?  I'm thinking that it's best you go your separate ways... unless that is... you are able to actually work this out.  Although it doesn't seem like that will happen.  Ultimately you two have pretty different sexual needs that don't seem to be able to be met within your relationship."

8 or 9 he was 30 or so. He used to work at my dad's store. I was bullied a lot as a kid and my parents were worried sick about it. So this guy and I would talk a lot. It meant the world to me that he was nice and affectionate. It went on from there. I knew I liked men so I was curious and I had just hit puberty too and this guy was telling me all the stuff that adults did. It seems so cool back then. He was definately grooming me. One day he asked if I was circumcised. I said yeah. He asked to see. I showed him. He told me I was so small and showed me his and how it would grow. He told me that mine wouldn't be of any use and that girls would laugh at it. So he taught me to masturbate. He would suck me off which I thought was hilarious and ick cos you know...pee. He tried to penetrate me but I didnt let him. The internet was just coming around so I started to figure things out. It was abuse, started out without me understanding things but later it was consensual. After a year or so he started to encourage me to seek pussy and fuck. How to groom my female friends and cousins and have sex with them. Then it finally clicked - thats what he had done to me. I didnt see him anymore after that. Ironically, a few years later in highschool my classmates were having sex with the older boys and it made me realize that they were just as predatory. The difference between them and this guy was just age and that he was smoother than they were. The kids would also romanticize their encounters and how they were ""wooed"" and then took them.   

I do not bear anyone any ill will. I've told close friends and they would tell me, ""Oh it wasn't your fault"" like they do in Good Will Hunting and they want to hold me. I do not need saving or holding. Im fine, I've talked it out during counselling and I'm actually more well adjusted than most. He took advantage of me but I was also a willing participant. I could have walked away at any time and I did. I joined the various forums with other abuse victims and did a lot of thinking. It isnt this singular narrative everyone thinks it is, there is a lot of grey. People don't get it. So I dont talk to people about it. They just freak out, think I'll abuse other kids. My ex even told my college Dean about it while I was a medical student. They called my hospital. Hospital told my attending and they had me escorted out with security and I was warned that if I returned while they were investigating they would take legal action. They then went into damage control mode and interviewed everyone I had worked with. I was the victim yet now people think otherwise. So I just dont care anymore.

Many of the tribes in North America had variations of what was called, ""two spirit"" natures.  If you were two spirit you had a female spirit in you.  Sometimes completely, where you dressed and acted as a woman, and sometimes only partially, where you dressed and acted as a man, but were the ""woman"" sexually.

In some tribes these two spirit men/women had mystical and shamanistic roles, which carried a kind of power to it.  In others they were simply the cook and servant of the men when the men were on hunting or war parties.  In almost all circumstance these two spirit souls were of the second lowest cast of the tribe.  Only overt slaves were lower.

On the reservation of my youth the tribe gave the gays their own house where they lived together.  A kind of acceptance.  But they were treated in a very ugly fashioned, and often beaten up by the men of the tribe when they got drunk.  I hid my nature until I could join the military and escape."
238,"Hi. I'm a gay man. I'm definitely gay. I exclusively date men. I've never been walking down the street and seen a female and been like ""damn, I want to put my dick in her."" (but I have those thoughts about men constantly). The idea of being romantic with a woman does nothing for me.

But, in the right situation, I can and have gotten sexual with a female (particularly in the context of a MMF threesome... and yes, I found myself with 7 inches of gay dick in her lady vagina). If I came out as bi, no one would take that seriously. I'm pretty fucking gay. Nor do I feel that ""bi"" most accurately describes my identity. I'm like 95% gay. So I round that up to ""GAY."" 

I don't see why there wouldn't be 95% straight guys in the world who are in the same boat as me, but reversed. And I don't see why they can't be just as justified in identifying as straight."
239,Only if its a Porsche
240,"My partner loves vintage, I wear basic tees. He wears boxers, I wear briefs. And we have a 5 inch height difference, so sharing pants is out of the question. The t-shirts that he has I borrow all the time, and he's flicked some of mine, but that's about it.

I like the difference. It's interesting. I like his sense of style, but it's not mine. 

I have a feeling though that he'd like to give me a makeover. I have received a steady stream of vintage shirts for birthdays and christmases over the years. I rarely wear them, but I still keep getting more :)"
241,Because you're an adult. 
242,Bisexual invisibility happens largely because bisexuals in opposite-sex relationships don't bother coming out.  
243,I'm proud.
244,He refers to pets.
245,"Or, in English, a ""best friend"" or a ""very close friend."""
