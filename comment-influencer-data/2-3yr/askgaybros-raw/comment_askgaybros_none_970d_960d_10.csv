0,You need to leave that family. No money is worth that. 
1,"I think we should make this a thing in gay culture: come out, get a congratulatory cheesecake. 😉 Glad it worked out for you!"
2,You're financially independent. Leave your mom's house for crying out loud.

6,See I've always had the opposite problem. Mirror Me is pretty damn hot. I don't even know who the troll is who replaces him in photos though.
7,Unpopular opinion threads are why we cant have nice things
8,That's creepy and doesn't sound like a good idea.
9,Fuckin shit man. That cute little fuck will be your spoiled little shit. It is your duty as unclebro.
10,"And yes, there's a a chance you won't find anyone and you might die alone too.

11,"Because guys come onto AGB looking to be told to dump the guy. They present a shitshow story of how awful the guy is, then ask what they should do. They know the answer, but don't want to actually break up, so they use the echo chamber to tell them what they already know."
12,At least he reads
13,You went full gay.
14,"If you're financially independent, then you should leave. However, you should not say anything mean to her or do anything else that would burn the bridge between you and them; it would only make things worse. Like you've said, they did not see any signs of you being gay, and since they only discovered this recently, it must be a major shock to them.

They may have been saying awful things now, but keep in mind that they may not be entirely sincere when they say it. Emotions must be running high for them now, so the best thing you could do is to keep your distance and let them cool off, return to their senses. After that, I don't know what will happen. I just want to emphasize that you should not burn the bridge between you and your family. If they keep treating you badly, rise above them and be the bigger person."

27,"If you want to bottom but often have loose stools, try adding some extra fiber to your diet. It will not only help with the whole pooping situation, it'll make anal much easier to prepare for. "
28,"I agree with what you're saying! If I just left and gave them time alone, they will eventually realize I don't need them and they can either choose to be in my life, or out of it. Their choice.

Totally agree that it's only been a month and things are definitely emotional still. Thanks!

29,"Masc guys feel that fem guys perpetuate gay stereotypes and ""ruin it for everybody""; people have a specific image when it comes to what a gay man is and not everyone fits it.

40,"They might put it back up once they've come up with trump specific language for it, rather than it being full of Obama's accomplishments. Let's hope trump defies all expectations and fills that Web page with accomplishments for lgbt people like nondiscrimination laws.

I learned that I need to kinda push/squeeze upwards behind my ballsack to get every last drop out after I was finished. This completely solved the issue for me"
49,Because it's fun.
50,"Yeah. I have a friend in Japan. When I went back and hung out with him he asked if I had been in a porno. I told him no and he told me he saw a screenshot from one and the guy looked like me. I figured he just thought all black guys looked alike due to their lack of exposure over there. To everyone, I looked like Will Smith. 

I go to his place, see the pic and I'm like whoaaa. Who the fuck would Photoshop my face into this guys body having an orgy. I freaked out and took all pics from my MySpace. Later, I turned the photo upside down and it was more obvious it wasn't me. He had a gap, thicker eyebrows. It was weird. I kept a copy of the pic though because it was funny. "

67,"&gt;cause **everything** we do is inherently gay. sucking dick; having sex; gay, even holding hands with your MALE partner is gay... 

Everything? Not to be rude, but that's probably part of the reason some men reach for labels to differentiate themselves. For some of us, our sexuality is a fact but not the core of our identity.

Straight acting is probably a misnomer, but it's understood to mean gender conforming. There's nothing wrong with being gender conforming and it's not a inherently a denial of sexuality or shaming those who chose to live outside of the norms. If you don't like rude people, then just say you don't like rude people."

There are many experiences you will have in life where people will try to put you down b/c of your race. It's their pathetic insecurities talking. It takes strength to be in an interracial relationship. He doesn't have it and is most likely concerned about what other people will think of him for dating a black guy. If you know your worth than you'll know he's not worthy of you. Give your love to someone deserving. These types never are.

Being smart does not grant you common sense or maturity. I highly doubt these guys know he is 15, I highly doubt anyone would risk going to jail for rape of a minor.

88,"Well I can't comment on Army culture but I'm out and in the Air Force. For the most part people are gonna look out for you. That's just military culture in general. You're one of us. It's like a family, everyone's your brothers and sisters. I was scared of coming out at first as well but after I did I wish I did it a whole lot sooner. Everyone is very supportive and if you tell them it's alright to joke with you they'll toss a few gay jokes your way every now and then. Honestly it's fun to fire some back at them as well. Every base I've been to everyone I work with always says they're cool with it and that they'll fuck up anyone whose not haha. My only advice is each time you get to a new unit don't tell them right away. Let them get to know you for you. You don't want to just be known as ""the gay guy"". Because while that's a big part of you it's not you're only attribute. Give them a few weeks to get to know you better and then when you feel like they know you better just let it slip in casual conversation. Easiest way to to do it.

You'll hear this sort of stuff from me on rare occasion. I just use it for irony/laughs, isn't meant to be literal.

145,"This is sitcom-level funny. My approach would be to have your boyfriend grow or trim the opposite facial hair situation as your brother. Even if your boyfriend can only grow a mustache, go with that. Also, if your brother doesn't wear glasses, have your boyfriend wear glasses. If his eyesite is fine, you can get fake warby parkers in the male as trials.

Just do this stuff to shift his look as much as possible on the first meeting. After that, you can have him gradually go back to normal when meeting your family.

149,"Tl;dr gender binary makes us all a little fucked up, but it's not right to assume someone is insecure because of what they're attracted to.

It really depends on the guy's past experiences as to whether it reflects some type of insecurity, but the reasoning behind why the whole concept exists is pretty well established and should be understood. It comes down to gender binary, where we're assigned a sex at birth which then supposedly determines our gender and sexual orientation. We know that's not really how it works, but these are the ideas that give birth to rigid gender roles, homophobia, and most importantly sexual violence. The term ""straight acting"" is essentially meaningless because what way is there to generalize all of the behaviors of a straight man? The traits that this term is associated with are easy enough to picture (deep voice, loose fitting clothes, short hair, unemotional, perhaps even slightly cruel or aloof), but the important thing to realize is that it's not a real thing—no one can 100% conform to this ideal (even Chuck Norris has emotions), much in the same way that no woman can live up to the simultaneously hypersexualized yet pure feminine role that society forces on her. 

So, one could argue that a gay man that prefers ""straight acting"" men could be insecure in his gender identity (a problem) OR is just more comfortable with men that are closer to the masculine ideal, and there's nothing wrong with that. The things that shape who and what we are attracted to are incredibly complex, so generalizing these guys by saying they're insecure because of a preference is a bit narrow in scope and demands a mountain of assumptions about the man in question.

Similarly, one could also argue that a gay man that feels hostile toward this group of ""straight acting"" preferred gay men is insecure in his gender identity or self esteem, because what other reasons are there for someone to be bothered by this term, aside from perhaps ignorance of why these social constructs exist?

The reason I responded to this was because I used to really be bothered by that term a lot. And yes, sometimes men that outwardly say they prefer ""straight acting"" guys are deeply insecure, but it might surprise you how many are actually incredibly well adjusted and just know what they want.

Anywho, cheers!

Edit: I would also mention, though, that it's still ill-advised to use this terminology just because it perpetuates gender binary. When I see it now, it's more just a sign that the guy isn't very informed about what masculinity and femininity actually imply or mean."

177,"&gt;Mirror Me is pretty damn hot. I don't even know who the troll is who replaces him in photos though.

A lot of that has to do with the way cameras work though. Nowadays, a lot of portraits are taken at a very close distance (usually not more than an arm's lenght even for group photos). 

This is called focal lenght - the distance between your camera’s lens and the spot it’s focusing on. But you really never want to take portaits this way because it causes distortion of facial features. Noses and foreheads look bigger while eyes look a little smaller.

There's an example [here.](http://www.tyrosize-blog.de/wp-content/uploads/Dan-Vojtech-3.jpg) You'll easily see that the bottom right picture looks much better than the top left, and that's because that picture was taken with the camera at a greater distance, zoomed in. We almost never take photos this way though, many are just taken by holding the camera while extending an arm which can lead to distortion and you appearing ""uglier"" than you really are.

Moral of the story: You're beautiful, don't believe the camera :) "
178,They voted for a bully. What do you expect?

180,"-Why their instagrams are filled with everyday selfies where they look the same.

-Why their instagrams are filled with pictures of their naked legs wearing socks and a cup of coffee. 

-Why are they so attention thirsty

-Their obsession with Gaga/Madonna/Miley Cyrus/Lana del Rey/Beyonce , I get that they admire them but they go way over the top.

-The hair coloring fashion, merman or whatever is called. 

-The hookup culture in general. It's always the same people on grindr, why can't they find what they're looking for if everyone is looking for the same?

181,"Think about the endgame. For how many years do you plan to keep that boyfriend? Forever? Do you want to keep him hidden for that time?  
If not, just introduce him to your family now. The earlier they will get to know him, the earlier they will get used to him."

187,"If it makes you feel better, he didn't block you because he found you unattractive or anything. He did fuck you.

He blocked you because you gave the impression you were open to dating or something more than just a hookup. He wasn't looking for that.

Judging by the rest of your story, and your comments in this thread, I can definitely see you coming off as clingy immediately after a hookup."
188,"I'll stop using an ad-blocker once sites stop doing these things: 

* Big flashy ads that sit in the corner of my view, being obnoxious.

* Infecting my computer with malware, adware and other such things.

* Sending me political ads about how terrible women have it and how  bad men are. 

* Spying on me. 

* Forces me to look at the ad. 

* Etc. 

Until then? I'll keep using adblockers and do so happily. I'm tired of my computers RAM being hogged up by bullshit and having to worry about malware from random ads. Fuck that shit. They treat me like shit, I treat them like shit. It's equality. "

222,"I'd be wary of visiting any country that didn't recognize my marriage.  It would be heartbreaking if something happened to my husband and I wasn't able to visit him in hospital.  There are lots of countries with gay marriage (see the [IGLA map](http://ilga.org/downloads/03_ILGA_WorldMap_ENGLISH_Overview_May2016.pdf)), so it's not like we'd ever run out of welcoming places to go.

A few months ago my hubby's uncle was visiting his daughter in Dubai, and he encouraged us to go visit as well.  I don't think most straight couples understand what it's like for gay couples to travel to places like that.  Dubai threw a Belgian guy in jail for a year just for admitting to being in a gay relationship.  We would have to pretend to be just friends travelling together, get separate beds, never show any affection, deny we were a couple if asked, etc.  No thank you very much."

234,"Yup.  Told a fraternity brother that I had a sex dream about him, and that it was the hottest experience I had ever had, real or not.  

He actually gave me a hug and said he was glad that someone was still into him, because his girlfriend had stopped having sex with him wanting to wait until marriage.  He then proceeded to ask me about every detail step-by-step, and told me that if he had a single gay cell in his body he would have helped make it reality.

It was a really refreshing conversation.  When someone is totally and completely secure in their own sexuality, that is how they act."
235,"More foreplay. Rim him until he begs you to fuck him. Finger him. Teach him to push out when you're going in. Once you're in, don't move, let him adjust. Tell him to clamp down on you as hard as he can for 10 seconds. Then repeat with the pushing out. His muscles will relax and you'll be able to help him more if you can coach him a bit."

244,"Personally it annoys me. I used to hang out with a gaymer group and they told me to ""act more gay"" or would call me ""straight acting."" No, I BEHAVE like myself, I'm not ""acting"" straight. I don't even know why that term is supposed to mean less flamboyant. Just say the term less flamboyant. 

Plenty of straight guys are flamboyant, though I guess they also get told they are gay sometimes based off of appearance.

If WE stopped acting like being gay comes with typical behavior requirements then that would help people outside our community also do the same."
245,"What's your character's motivation? Like, why would a FedEx guy just jump in like that after a drink? Are you going to build this narrative out?

Maybe the package just happens to have fabric softener and lube in it, and maybe the fed ex driver got rained on, but he's also dealing with his clothes being super itchy, and then maybe the old guy is like, ""I could throw your clothes in the dryer for you and also use this fabric softener I just got from Argentina that's supposed to be really good,"" and then maybe you're like sure, but can you do my socks and underwear too?"", and then he's like, ""of course, have a seat. I couldn't help but notice that your penis looks really itchy"" and you're like ""yeah, it's really itchy from the itchy clothes,"" and then he's like, ""well, the other thing I ordered just happens to be anti-itch cream that's also a sexual lubricant. you could try it if you want."" 

That would be *completely plausible* and help you stay in character probably."

249,"&gt;""dump him"" advice over the smallest, solveble issues

I can relate only to this one, because I noticed it, too. I guess the reason is, that if you don't know someone, it's much more easier to advise him drastic measures.

I didn't noticed anyone saying that monogamy is a bad thing, but I can see that most of people here supports the idea of open relationships. I can understand that, men were always seen as the more horny gender (I doubt it's true, btw.) and if you have other horny men around, it's not easy to oppose the temptation. Especially, because men are usually much more direct with each other, so asking someone ""hey, bro, wanna fuck?"" is not really a problem."
