0,"Having actually read the damn article, which doesn't actually talk about Islam that much, it is scarily spot on.

Having lurked/commented on this subreddit for for three or so years, it's very clear that there are many users here who would be generally amenable to Jack Donovan's ideology and the far right more generally.

Tons of people here hate feminism - check.

Tons of people here aren't just not attracted to women, but express a distaste for their company (""I don't care about women and don't want any female friends. I get along better with men"") and a belief in their moral inferiority (""Lol so glad I'm gay and don't have to deal with those overdramatic bitches!"") - check.

Tons of people here hate pink-haired ""SJWs"" and identity politics activists - check.

Tons of people here have no patience for any claims of racism from ethnic and racial minorites - check.

Tons of people (or some) - express laughably paranoid fear over Black Lives Matter and black activists in general, as evinced in this very thread - check.

Tons of people here don't like trans people and think they're mentally ill - check.

Tons of people here claim they don't dislike feminine gay men, but say they only want to hang out with masculine gay men and describe masculinity as ""normal"" (implying feminine gay men are not) - check.

And, yes, a fuckton of people here are more than willing to vote for right-wing parties that oppose gay rights if they're willing to promise them protection from *the Muslims* - check.

Are you all sure you don't want to go join Jack Donovan's m√§nnerbund of masc musc white men out in the woods?"

""Dad, what does gay mean?"" the son asks.

4,"I think your feelings on this are pretty valid. It does seem like he's at least a little embarrassed, and maybe the fact that he hadn't introduced you to his friends for so long is another testimony to that. 

However, on the flip side, I think he is trying to process a clash of worlds. It seems like his friends are very different from you, and while he enjoys being around you and his friends separately, bringing these together was stressful. A lot of people, gay or straight, worry about fitting in and being judged, and he may not have had to deal with emotions like that before. 

If you do meet up tomorrow, I do think you should express that you were hurt by what he said. These types of emotions are best expressed and not bottled up. But the fact that he will want to talk means he cares about you and how you felt. Listen to him, tell him how you felt, and see what happens. "
5,You spent all day cramming dicks in your mouth and now you're surprised that your throat is sore?
6,Its not always about straight men. Some gay men are insecure about their masculinity too.

9,I suffer from panic disorder and I get random unprovoked panic attacks from time to time. When I first got to know him I tried my best to hide it from him because I was insecure about it. One night while we were together I got a really really bad one out of the blue. Without hesitation he took me in his arms and cuddled me till I felt better. I wasn't cured from it by any means (that's not how it works) but he made it feel a lot more bearable. When it was over he was held me close and told me how he will always help me feel safe with him. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

17,I'd love it. There's only so many posts about high school straight crushes one can tolerate.
18,"I heard this one in high school. I don't know how original it is, and I don't remember it exactly as it was told to me, but here we go:

There were‚Äã three gay best friends who's boyfriends, most unfortunately, all passed away at the same time. They had each decided to have their loved ones cremated and we're discussing what they were going to do with the ashes.

The first friend said he would spread his boyfriend's ashes on a mountain near their favorite camping spot. 

The second friend said that he would take the ashes home and keep them on his mantle as a keepsake for the love they shared. 

The third friend smiled and said, ""Well I'm going to sprinkle my boyfriend's ashes in a bowl of chili and eat it so he can tear my ass up one last time.""

29,"I had no experience with dating at all, so every other meeting was full of big and little surprises to me. I guess he knew he has to play it carefully around me, so we were progressing very slowly. Our first dates weren't really different from friendly meetups that we used to have for years. Sure, there was a little bit of flirting, touching and goodbye kisses, but it was very gentle.

I belive I started falling for him when we were going back from football match and we stopped at city view point. We were alone there and I loved it, but it was a little bit cold and windy despite the fact that it was the middle of summer. He noticed it and for the first time he pressed his body against my back, wrapping his arms around me.

It just felt so wonderful to be that intimate with someone... and to know that he was there to take care of me, without even one my word. He smelled nice, he gave me warmth and I felt so safe... I just wanted to fall asleep there, standing in that position, lol.

He drove me home and after this date I started looking at him in compeletly different way."

You have an obligation to treat people equitably in your business and professional dealings, and in your conduct as a citizen within a community. 

That obligation does not extend to who you fuck. I like twinks. Does that mean I'm going to flirt harder with a twink I meet at a bar versus a masc daddy bear type? You bet.

46,"A closeted, gay man and his boyfriend are having his mother over for a weekend at their 2 bedroom apartment. He's not ready to come out to his mom yet so he and his boyfriend decide to pretend that they're roommates. 

""So for one weekend, we'll just pretend to be friends,"" he said to his boyfriend, ""I'll make it look like the guest room is my bedroom and I'll sleep on the couch when my mom his here.""

So his mother came for the weekend, the two men pretended to be straight room mates, they had a good time, and at the end of the weekend, she went home. 

After she's gone, the couple go back to their room and after making love they decide to watch some TV before bed. But the remote control was missing. They searched all over the room but couldnt find it. No matter, they would turn the TV off manually until they find it.

A week goes by and the couple is still turning on their TV manually as the remote is still missing. 

""Maybe your mom might know where it is?"" 
""Its worth a shot, it did go missing after she was here afterall.""

So he calls his mom up and asks her, ""Hey mom, before I say anything I just want you to know, I'm not jumping to any conclusions, but ever since you left, the remote control for my room mate's TV has been missing, do you know where it is?""

His mother responds, ""That's okay sweetie. I'm not jumping to any conclusions either, but if the bed I slept in was actually your bed, you would have found it by now."""

50,"My ex was the same way. He had Grindr and would check it for pics. He said he preferred Grindr over porn. But he would also chat w/ guys so that they could send him pics and he would send pics too. I was like you and I didn't like it at all. He said he would stop and erased the app but he couldn't help it and he downloaded the app again. We broke up for several reasons and this one being of them. However our relationship was much shorter than yours (10 months) and there were other things that led us to break up.
My point is he just looks at pics, then starts chatting to get more pics, then he sees that they have things in common or there is mutual attraction and they want to meet. Eventually, they mess around behind your back.
If your b/f can't drop his phone then I would question my relationship. "
51,I don't see how this specifically targets straight guys. Gay men go through the same social pressure from gender norms as straight men.

84,"Don't take it personally. When your automatic reflex to calling somebody for a long time is mainly one name, it isn't malicious for the name to slip out later on if they aren't consciously thinking about what they're saying.

Sort of like a child calling a female teacher ""mum"" because that's their inert response to a female guardian figure. 

I myself call the men at work my boyfriend's name when I'm not thinking about it. 


It isn't a sign that he's thinking about them and in fact if you get angry with him about it, it will ironically have the opposite effect that you wanted. Where he will be thinking in his head ""don't call her xxxx"" over and over, the name is repeating more and more inside his head, so the likelihood that he'll spit that name out goes up.


Just laugh it off, he's only human."

157,"I'm deaf, and can't really speak for myself or lipread.  
  
The ""traditional"" route of meeting gay people in bars is not something that I've ever been willing to try mostly because of my lack of confidence in presenting myself to hearing strangers.  If I see a cute guy and approach him with writing on a text app on my phone, that weirds out most people.   Likewise, if a guy approaches me and I can't understand him, he will just move on to someone else.  
  
I meet most gay people through the apps because I have full control over how to communicate with others, and how to present myself to others.  I've typically done this in one of two ways.  Sometimes I disclose that I'm deaf, which I imagine scares off most men that might otherwise be interested in me.  Other times, I don't disclose that I'm deaf, and I get messages ... then I disclose that I'm deaf later, and that person disappears.  I'd like to say that it is better for me to be open and upfront about my deafness from the beginning.  However, I do also understand that most people have never met a deaf person in their life and don't really know what to ""do"" with deaf people, so they'd rather just move on down the list.  
  
One nice thing, though, about being deaf is that the people who do message me, and especially those who I eventually meet in person, are people who are willing to make communication work and build a friendship/relationship with me. Those friends are what makes all the frustration worth it to me."
158,So brave 
159,"Yup, the only difference is that a good deal of gay guys are already considered ""male trash"" so this doesn't affect us, like going broke doesn't affect an already homeless person."
160,"Take it and run. Sorry but you don't need this ""family"""
161,"Two gay guys are in the shower. The phone rings so one guy gets out. He say to the other guy, ""Don't do anything without me."" The other guy promises not too.
When the guy returns from his phone call he looks in the shower and sees cum all over, ""I told you not to do anything without me."" The guy looks at him and says, ""All I did was fart."""
162,this fucking sucks
163,"A pride parades purpose is to show support, love, and unity. You don't have to be gay to show either of those things. In fact, I think it's a strong message when a straight person goes to these parades. It sends the message that gay, straight, or bi, we are all the same and we care for eachother regardless of sexuality. It shows **""We Are One""**"
164," &gt; You can hold all of those opinions without being a white nationalist

You absolutely can. I think the article is just pointing out that those beliefs make it easier to take a step further towards white nationalism. "
165,"My bf and I straddle 70 yrs old.  He was, back in the mid '70's a fashion model in Paris and he has maintained an incredible smile and great eyes.   He ""smoldered"" in his photos from the Paris era and he doesn't smolder any more, but he's still hot, and he claims that I am ""hot"" as well.  He's a little over 5'10"", mostly bald and he and I sag where we didn't in years past.   But he retains that love-the-camera that the good models have and his photos are arresting because he looks directly into the lens.   He looks good in his clothes and has all the fashion sense in our relationship (and I have none of it).  He's incredibly funny and we spend an awful lot of time just laughing."
166,"$29,426.07

167,Me.
168,"I'd love to stay and chat, but you're a total bitch."
169,"Just going to drop these here:

"
170,Yeah that was basically when I decided to just let it all go since it showed he at least understood how I felt that night. So it was nice to hear :)
171,"Sooooo many, it's hard to keep track of them all. I basically jerk off everywhere I go.

+ In Middle / High School, countless sleepovers I've jerked off while my friends were asleep.

+ Jerked off behind a friend while he played Counter Strike on my PC.

+ Jerked off while driving in the car to work.

+ In a hotel room, I jerked off while my mom slept in the other bed.

+ I've jerked off outside many times, but never too obvious or public.

+ Watching a boring movie with friends, I jerked off with a blanket over me. It wasn't even a solid blanket, but a hand crocheted one with lots of holes.

+ I've jerked off at work in the bathroom stalls, in the building stairwell, conference rooms and once in my boss's office while he was away on a trip (came on the fucker's desk).

+ In HS I'd get super horny all the time so I'd sometimes discreetly edge during class and finish afterwords in the bathroom.

+ I've jerked off in the water at a public beach in the Caribbean.

+ I once used the spare key to let myself into a friend's house while his family was on vacation and jerked off in his dirty boxers."
172,Friends go out for drinks together.  Why would you give the impression you're hitting on him by asking him if he wants to go for a few drinks? 
173,"I see we missed the articles ""The Art of Douching"" and ""I'm Masc, so why am I the Bottom?""."
174,"Not a particularly useful contribution but:
What a cunt!"
175,"Not enough bigger, bulkier guys bottoming for top smaller guys."
176,"Wait, uber drivers are a fetish?"
177,THIS IS WRAAAAASTLING!
178,"Top knots with dyed hair, pink backwards caps with ""bitch"" ""slut"" ""masc"", and shirts that say ""No Whites No Masc"".  "
179,Barebacking. Having no morals. Harassing other men at bars. 
180,"What spectacle? It's all super corporate now. Banks, Car Dealers, Politicians. 

It's Disney Land now.  

Everything that made it gay and special and unique died a long time ago.

The gays that are embarrassed by it still wish they were straight.

Why is it so bad to see a hot guy in a jockstrap in public?

182,You didn't even have to stick it in crazy to find it
183,I already have a beard lol http://i.imgur.com/R3JXieE.jpg 
184,"For me, I was on a trip with my hockey team and my assigned roommate and I got drunk and made out as a sort of dare (even though it was just the two of us). It was sloppy but still pretty hot. We kept making out for about a month, until we got caught. After that he ""wasn't gay"" and I ""exaggerated what happened."" His current girlfriend has no idea about any of it. My current boyfriend is 1,000x better at kissing. "
185,Shit.
186,Oh lol I had no idea üòÇ
187,You seem to be very... calm about it. (Ôæü‚å£Ôæü )
188,"But he held a flag one time and promised to protect us against a hateful foreign ideology!

/s"
189,The guys might be hot but I can't stand the girls! They all make that high pitched moaning sound and it annoys me so much haha if a guy moans while getting fucked in porn it's bearable/hot but with girls I just can't stand it. Sorry for my rant :)
190,I'm saying off that train for sure 
191,This is right below the panic attack one. Purrfect.
192,YOU'RE PERFECT YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK LIKE LINDA EVANGELISTA ... YOU'RE A MODEL
193,"What does one gay guy say to another gay guy at a bar?

Here, let me push in your stool. "
194,"If you drive through conservative parts of the country (like Indiana) there are billboards with nearly naked women advertising ""men's clubs"" or adult stores basically every mile. People like to celebrate sexuality at pride because straight sexuality is always on display while gay sexuality has historically been hidden and viewed as perverted and wrong. It's a double standard that shouldn't exist. So although it can be a bit garish, I understand the concept. "
195,The racist Black or Latin thug thing pisses me off to the higgest degree in gay porn. 
196,Pits. 
197,"I don't think you're out of line at all, but if you want a constructive conversation out of this (and you should, because he's your SO) try to keep emotions in check

Look at the facts:

You had to ask to meet his circle of friends

He made an insensitive remark about your ""flamboyance""

I'd say the one with the issue is him and his boundaries

If he is worried about how his friends perceive you and if they had an unkind remark he should have manned up and put that person in their place

I am a firm believer that your man should always have your back and he should love you despite ""flamboyance"" otherwise why did he decide to date you?

If he can't own that then he probably has a lot of other unstated baggage

Don't compromise yourself for the sake of others

As long as you weren't vulgar, revealed tmi about impolite topics of public discussion, nor hit on his friends then why should it be an issue?"
198,"Can someone explain to me how a candle with the scent ""man town"" reinforces straight masculinity? I'm so confused. Straight people are weird sometimes. "
199,"Not true, this one could be his last which is what I hope for. It's be cute if they ended up together forever. "
200,Turns out somebody's arm was already up there.
201,They dont :/
202,I usually have a boner in my heart üò©
203,"Interesting topic (sad it's getting downvotes).

Im all for transgender people. Let them participate in whatever they want!

However when it comes to professional sport, nope. Yeah, she is now a woman but you can't just ignore / eliminate that she once was a guy with a higher muscle mass. It's not fair to the other women who were born as women"
204,"I don't think a lot of the people here are even trying to be ""bros"", it's just the busiest gay sub at this point."
205,"May have served him better had he discussed some of his kink fantasies wth you first. Unexpected for sure. Was it meant to be playful? Either way, when it comes to BDSM, there should always be discussion first.

Sorry that he didn't communicate with you "
206,"It was a funny, tangential anecdote. I think straight guys can handle it. Aren't they supposed to be less sensitive than gays anyway? "
207,I heart fabulous cock and ass.
208,there are lots of gay cops out there
209,Definitely tummy.
210,I hope Ms. May takes your porn away.
211,"Man, it's so weird how people think there are only two sides to this. I can fix some plumbing, do basic woodwork and some electrical. Manly. I also am a programmer and gamer. Nerdy. I watch drag race, like lady gaga and like going out to my local bar sometimes. Femmy?

I've got a beard and chest hair. Manly. I'm skinny. Twinky. 

Does that mean I'm femmy or manly or what? I don't give a fuck! anyone who likes me, likes me. 

Just be yourself and let the cards fall where they may. This also applies to people that you attracted to."
212,Where are these dudes? I want to hang out with them.
213,"Actually... this is a good article. Thanks for posting it. The mods at gaybros should not have deleted it - no relevant article/ thread should be deleted.

That said, I'm going to quote the smartest comment on the article;  

*the author does too casually dismiss the extreme homophobia in traditional Islam, that does drive gay people to vote for Le Pen or support Gert Wilders or a Pym Fortun), and indeed the dire treatment of gays in most Islamic majority countries.  It is a concern when it comes to mass immigration of Muslims, especially when there is no filter for the educated and secularized. Dumb policy gets you bad results.*

When it comes to Islam, the alt right are using the politics of fear - but that fear is *well* justified.  If the left only had the sense to recognise that Islam is a totalitarian, oppressive, misogynistic, homophobic medieval throwback then the alt right would have nil appeal to any LGBT people.  Unfortunately the people in the article have rolled this together with race hatred and anti semetism and are sucking people into the whole package. Some honesty about Islam would take away their one appealing factor"
214,"He said ""date"" women.  Nothing about having sex with them or *not* having sex with men üòú"
215,This is actually really common. It even happens between parents and children when they first meet in adulthood if the child was raised by somebody else. 
216,"If that gives you a sore throat, you're doing it wrong."
217,"Even you don't agree with him, you've got to admire Jeremy Corbyn a little bit.  The press all hate him, his shadow cabinet openly wants rid of him, the party establishment are practically jerking off at the memory of Tony Blair, but Labour voters are sticking with him.  At the start of the election it was supposed to be a wipe out, now he'll probably lose by about the same margin as Milliband."
218,"Legs, especially the calves!"
