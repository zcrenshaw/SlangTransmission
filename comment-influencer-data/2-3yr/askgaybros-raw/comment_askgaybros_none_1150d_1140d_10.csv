0,"Pretty sure that classifies as a form of rape. Some people would argue otherwise, but you would not have consented without the condom. You were mislead into having a form of sex you did not consent to."
1,"I think you could answer your own questions by asking them to yourself. Simply insert the opposite gender where applicable and the word straight where gay appears:

So this might be obvious but being straight means you're sexually attracted to women right? So would seeing a super attractive woman turn you on or is being straight more about being attracted to women's personalities?

For people that are 100% straight do men not turn you on at all? If a man was giving you a blow job would you not get turned on from it?

When did you personally discover you were straight? I hear stories about people realizing at a young age but I don't understand how you can ""discover"" something so innate as to which gender you're attracted to. What do people mean when they say they ""found out"" they were straight at 6 or 7 or whatever?

Discovering sexuality is what it is, regardless if the object turns out to be a man or woman or both, nothing really different going on."

6,"""butt don't leave me!"" tips to keep your man cumming back for more. 

1. Chocolate is a sexy erotic aphrodisiac. Take some chocolate and lick around it while maintaining eye contact. Really show off your skills!. 


2. Oh the shade of it all. Throw some 50 shades of grey into your bedroom by fingering him without lube. The mixture of pain and pleasure will provide an exciting experience! Bonus points if you still have chocolate on your fingers from before. 


3. Masc4masc: gay guys love being masc! And gays love those cuddly bears. Put on that bear mask and show your man the animal you are. For extra fun, roll around outside like a real bear first! 


4.  Be super discreet. Some guys don't want to know about their secret sex with you. Make the room dark. Darker. More! Make sure he can't see a thing. Having your guy be as blind as possible will make him more comfortable. 


5.  Rupaul's judgement: after a threesome have the two men lip sync for their relationship using your penis as a microphone. Enjoy the view of that booty as they sashay away. "

8,"I hate to start with outright cynicism, but I have to expect that any written statement you give your wife is headed straight into the hands of her divorce lawyer. 

&gt;having a mixed orientation marriage, etc. She is not interested in an open relationship

So she's asking you to give up on sex and love in the sense of a real relationship for the rest of your life? If you're not OK with that, and it sounds like you're not, that would be a recipe for betrayal and resentment and animosity that would poison your kids growing up. Better to live apart and treat each other like adults and be there for your kids as best you can.

I'm cheered to hear you're seeing a therapist. Are you also seeing a divorce lawyer? People do awful, unexpected things in situations like this, and you need to be in the strongest position you can to protect yourself and your relationship with your children.

As for whether you'll be OK finding guys... I suspect you'll do as well as any of us. But starting a new life with somebody might have to wait until things settle into place with your old one.

Good luck to you."

Also, just tell your parents the end of the condom split open while it was being used and wasn't noticed until after. Then in private tell the real story to the medical professionals. "

22,"*sigh* this world needs better sexual education.

STD's like HIV, Chlamydia, Syphilis, Ghorronorah, Herpes don't just magically materialize out of thin-air. If both you and your partner are STD free, and ditch the condoms - you won't get them unless one of you cheats and brings something back home.

That said - there is bacteria in the anus that can still cause bacterial infections in the urethra, which can lead to Urinary Tract Infections or Epididymitis (inflammation of a tube that carries sperm) of which the symptoms can be similar to a Chlamydia - and the treatment is the same. Its rare, and can generally be avoided by having a piss after you fuck. 

If you do start to feel a bit of a tingle when you start to pee - increase your fluids (lots) and drink cranberry juice (actual cranberry juice, not cranberry watered down sugary cocktail) you can usually stop it from taking hold before you start pissing fire and blood. But, if you do start to piss fire and blood - make your way to a walk in clinic. The antibiotics will have you feeling better within a few hours."
23,"When I was working at a restaurant a guy I was crushing on said ""/u/Just_FillingtheVoid, I'm right behind you"", just as a warning to not move backwards or anything, Well me being me, responded with ""I've waited my whole life to hear you say that""....

He and almost half the kitchen just looked at me and I was just like ""that was my outside voice wasn't it..."" We all laughed and went about the rest of the night but for the rest of my time there anytime something was said someone would whisper ""I've waited my whole life to hear you say that""

I was in Juvi and this other guy was being held in the same unit as me. Everyone pretty much knew that he was gay and that I wasn't straight either.  I thought he was pretty cute and a few other people told me the feeling was mutual. Except that he would never talk to me! Whenever I tried to start a conversation, he'd just murmur something and run away. Finally, I thought I'd be more direct, I wanted to say something like, ""It's not like I'm gonna rape you if you say hi to me or something."" but I actually said, ""I won't rape you if you say hi to me."" Good thing that was the last day I was in Juvi. I still wonder if he thinks about the guy that wanted to rape him.."
26,"I usually just slip in the old, ""Oh yeah my ex boyfriend was totally into whatever it is we're talking about he soo loved it, even got me into whatever it is we're talking about for a while... ""

Doesn't matter if there was an actual ex boyfriend or a guy you were talking to that goes with the story you just told, you just casually let whoever you're talking to know that you dig the dick ;)"
27,"You need to call him to talk as soon as possible. Don't ignore him. I'm sure he's feeling terrible right now. You're hurting him deeply by not talking to him.

Just tell him what you're thinking. Tell him that your answer is no and that you're freaked out by the fact that he proposed to you. If you don't know what the future of your relationship is going to be, then tell him you don't know. Just tell him what you're thinking. Don't ignore him. That's cruel."

2) Fuck the guilt. He's abusive, and you can either be divorced or you can go back to being mentally and physically abused by an addict who clearly doesn't respect or trust you. What's more, how can you ever trust him again? And why would you be with a man you're afraid of and can't trust not to hit you again?

3) You might love him, but it doesn't sound like he loves you. It sounds like he's controlling, insecure, angry, and violent. Just looking at the few things you mention here, the guy sounds like a fucking psycho. Normal husbands don't hit their spouses, or change their phone numbers, or throw them out of their homes, or isolate them from the outside world.

Me: Chipotle...

67,"I'd just recently broken up with my boyfriend and I was super horny, so I found a guy on Grindr and we decided to hook up. We rolled around a bit and he was playing with my nipples which was driving me crazy, plus I was already super horny, so naturally I decided I wanted to fuck (not exactly thinking rationally at this point). 

Problem 1: I'd never been fucked (not even sure I had sex toys at this point) so I wasn't stretched out or anything. 

Problem 2: pretty sure this guy had never had gay sex before, because he didn't even try to finger me or lube me up or even test that I could accommodate him (and he wasn't small). 

So basically what happened was he put on a condom and banged against my asshole for like 20 seconds before he came, then he started profusely apologizing for not lasting long. Externally, I was like ""no problem dude"" and internally I was like ""oh thank god it's over.""

So yeah, that was my first time doing ""anal."""

75,"Alright, I'll just lay down some basic Grindr 101 for you:

Grindr is for fucking, not making friends. Some people might make friends, but that's rare and not what the app is good for.

A guy 10 years older than you almost certainly just wants sexual things. An 18 year old and a 28 year old have very little in common.

A guy asking to meet you after dark, particularly in the summer, is almost certainly looking to do some sex. If you want friendship, you go to dinner or drinks or something first."

They will drift inevitably,  so just start with that now.  No point in arguing with them, they're not open minded."

80,"From Kenya, it's all taboo and shit but later when everyone's not looking the biggest hecklers and homophobic men come back asking for a stint. Being gay in public e.g. having a partner or even giving a semblance of showing affection will get you unwanted and most likely dangerous attention. There are some effemiinate men who can't help but be effeminate, we all know they're gay but we act aloof and don't talk about it because they're nice people. To sum things up, it's homophobic as hell yet gay sex happens literally everywhere. "

tell him when you actually have control. 
"
85,"Compromise and communication are key. You'll both have habits that bug the other. Some you'll learn to live with, others will drive you crazy. Always keep in mind that for every thing he does that irritates you, you're doing something that irritates him. He might leave dishes in the sink, but maybe you never take out the trash. Build chore lists around those things so the dishes are your responsibility and the trash is his. Talk to each other when things are bothering one of you so they don't build into resentments that cause blow-ups. Try to stay calm in disagreements, and try to stick to the topic rather than moving to personal attacks. Use ""I"" statements rather than ""you"" statements: ""I don't like it when there are dishes in the sink"" rather than ""you always leave dishes in the sink."" Try not to go to bed mad at each other.

We usually start making out and foreplay, then he bends me over his knee and gives me a good spanking.  Then I suck him off and he fucks me.  His (and my) favorite position is when I'm flat on my stomach and he can really drill me.  We are monogamous and don't use condoms, so he always cums inside my ass.  Then he flips me over and makes out with me while I cum.  It's incredibly satisfying.  I like being sub, it makes me feel like I'm his and that I like belong to him.

98,"He consented to safe sex with a condom. The other guy proceeded to penetrate him without a condom. 

He didn't consent to that."
99,"My ex was organist at a huge Christian Church. He had the key for practice purposes, and naturally we had sex frequently in any room of our choosing in this place. It was a long distance relationship, we only saw each other twice a month, and when my car broke down I took to taking the bus down to his place. The bus stop was around the corner from the church, and there's one particular memory that really stands out. 

One day when I arrived down there around 9pm, our sexual tensions got the best of us and we booked it to the church (we were young, I think he was 19 at the time). We barely stepped foot in the sanctuary when some hotness ensued. It was dark, almost pitch black except for the streetlights shining through the stained glass windows. 

I wrestled him to the ground directly in front of the altar, pulled his pants and undies down in one fell swoop, and began eating his ass compelled by the power of christ. His hole was wide open, which was kind of unusual at the time, so I could tell he was very eager and ready to be stuffed. 

I yanked his shoes and socks off and greedily began lapping at and massaging his feet, as this makes my dick harder than anything in the world. I pulled my pants around my waist, shoved my cock in his mouth and fucked his face till it was drenched in spit. Then with his ass up in the air and pants down around his ankles, I pushed my dick in his hole as far as it could go. Our grunts and moans echoed off the walls of the empty sanctuary. 

I remember it being extra primal and messy, saliva and sweat pretty much everywhere while I pounded his hole in front of the altar. We went at it for what felt like hours, my cock  gliding in and out of his ass as our clothes became absolutely drenched in sweat. 

I got into the rhythm of pulling my cock almost all the way out with only my head inside, and he would clench and squeeze his hole around my tip so it got sucked back up inside him. I'd push deep enough inside him till our balls were touching, then I'd pull back out and repeat the process. 

We were quite in tune with each other and were very good at cumming at the same time. Eventually I shot a freakishly long and huge load in his ass while his cock spurted off in my hand, painting the floor surrounding us. That was on a Friday night. 

I stayed until Sunday evening, and was no doubt in church that morning to support his playing. I couldn't stop staring at the spot on the floor where this went down while sitting back in the pews, trying not to laugh out loud. Sorry this is so graphic but I have very vivid memories of my times in that church. We fucked in every single room, from the two kitchens to the pastors cushy chair in his private office. No regrets!"

101,"A lot of straight men enjoy getting attention from gay men, it's an ego boost as it makes them feel attractive and sexually desirable, even thought 99% of them would never do anything sexual with another guy.

He supports privatized prisons, NAFTA and TPP, privatized Social Security, school vouchers, and thinks the US should withdraw from NATO and the UN. He opposes gun regulations, campaign contribution limits, student loans and Pell grants, and government funding of scientific/medical research. He truly believes that government and ""society"" get in the way of progress, and we will only improve as a nation if we allow big business to plot its own course the way it used to back in the Gilded Age.

He's a nice guy, and he knows his stuff, but he supports everything liberals are against and he opposes everything liberals want for America. But like Ron Paul, he's likely to get a lot of the stoner vote. They'll vote for anyone who promises to legalize drugs without requiring them to put on pants in the daytime."

117,"Your logic makes complete sense, but instinctual attraction doesn't always follow logic. That said, I'm rarely attracted to guys who ""flaunt"" their looks anyway. A cute, secure guy is miles above a hot, arrogant one. "

121,"5 Selfies You Should Actually Use As Your Hook-up App Profile Pic

1)The Gym Selfie. Buy a band tee shirt and rip the sleeves off it, so that everyone working out next to you can see your belly button through your new big wizard sleeve holes. Pose in front of the mirror when you have a good pump. Don’t smile. Bros don’t smile.

2)The Dressing Room Selfie. Put on the most expensive outfit you can find at a high end department store, like a $50 cotton tee shirt that says ARMANI EXCHANGE in big silver letters across the front, and pose in front of the dressing room mirror. Make a kissy face. Instant sexy.

3)The Bathroom Selfie. First, plug in your iPhone where the hair dryer goes because it’s dying. Next, take all the shit out your drawers and throw it on the counter to make it look like you are too busy to clean up after yourself. Take 100 pictures cause no one’s ever gonna know you sat on the toilet to poo while you selected the best one.

4)The Random Chick Next To You Selfie. You know that hot girl you barely know but you took a good picture with once? Post the entire picture as your profile pic. Guys will think “Who is this guy who knows people? I like that!” You’re getting laid now.

5)The Snapchat Selfie. Take a picture of yo fine self. Add filter. Add some text about how you just cannot today. Screenshot that shiz so that all the tool icons are embedded into your new profile picture. Post. Wait for the messages to start pounding your inbox.

123,"I was going to propose to my ex boyfriend. We had a dog, we lived in my condo, and had a life together. I found out he was cheating the day before my birthday, and about a month before I was going to propose.  We had been exclusive and that was what both of us wanted (or so I thought) and agreed upon.

The up side? Didn't need to spend money on the ring!"
124,"Going off your post.

Girl, you're stronger than I am. If you truly tried to talk to him about it and was willing to discuss ""options"" and he still went behind you back.

I mean on some level I feel bad for him.

However, you gotta take care of yourself too, honey. It's not selfish for you to require respect from your spouse. Don't let yourself be drug down forever, never being fulfilled, to make him happy.

If he has lied that long, I would cut ties. You seem MORE than reasonable. Hang in there, put you and kid first. You have spent enough energy providing patience your husband doesn't seem to have deserved."
125,"This statement is quite sad.
If only because it's absolute truth."
126,"This sort-of counts, I guess? 

Ex and I first dated when we were like 21-22, and we live in New Orleans, and it was basically a drunken party, cause hey, we were fresh 21, and it was New Orleans (Pre-Katrina) we ended up calling it quits because I was in college, and wanted out of NoLa.  So basically, at the time we both wanted different things out of life, we went our separate ways, and lost touch after a few months.  

Fast forward about a decade, and we ended up bumping into each other on Facebook through a mutual friend, and we started talking again, we both got our shit together, got our party years out of our system, and started long distance dating (New Orleans to Albany NY) he moved up here about 3 years ago, and everything is great.  We're married, bought a house together, and life is pretty fucking awesome.  

So .... yeah, that. "
127,"Well, I think we've all put off therapy long enough."
128,"Regarding your question about discovering that you're gay. It can be kind of hard to picture if you haven't gone through it. When you're a kid, you kind of assume you're the same as everyone else, and you want to fit in with your peers. So when your classmates talk about how much they like boobs, you talk about boobs too. And when other kids start developing crushes, you get your own crushes too. Because that's just what you do. But eventually you realize that everyone else is very serious about their interest in girls, and that everyone else has feelings for girls that you don't have. And then you realize that their feelings for girls are actually the same as the feelings that you have for guys. And you realize that your classmates don't share those same feelings that you have for guys. 

It's not a super obvious thing like you might expect. If you're sheltered and aren't exposed to the concept of being gay, then you may never even notice that you're gay at all, or you may notice way later in life."
129,"It is a myth. Love is great, but you have to work to maintain it, since nobody is perfect. It's a choice you have to keep making despite you and your partner's imperfections and areas where you clash, it's not something that magically happens to you Disney-style. 

You should also work on your fear of being in a relationship because it might fail. That's like refusing to go out and enjoy the warmth and sunshine while it's summer because you know that one day it'll be winter. Relationships do fail and that's okay. "

132,"Honestly he's a better man for that.
99% of the time when trust gets broken, it never gets mended again. He realizes that and is just going to bow out instead of doing this all over again."
133,"Straight men spend a lot of time not knowing what's going on. I mean it with respect, but it's still true. Sometimes their wives and girlfriends guide them so much I think they should be put in a stroller."
134,"A few things to think about:

First off - you probably shouldn't have sex with anyone you don't trust regardless of what they say their HIV status is.

Two - studies have shown time and time again that a person with HIV whose viral load is undetectable is extremely unlikely to pass on the virus. See the PARTNER study.

Three - guys who think/say they're negative but were recently infected and may not yet realize it are more likely to have high viral loads and are more likely to pass on the virus.

Four - PrEP is very safe and extremely effective. Using condoms and PrEP together drastically reduces your risk of contracting HIV, even if your partner is HIV+. 

Bottom line is - have the conversation upfront, have sex with people you trust, protect yourself.

136,I might puke a bit in my mouth 
137,"personally I would text everyone and be like we havent hung out in a long time that everybody should get together and ask when everyone is free to meet, if they still dodge you after this effort then personally i would ask one person in the group that you feel close with why everyone seems to be avoiding you and then if nothing changes i would move on and probably look for a group of 2-3 guys to hang with and move on cause in all honesty it their lost and you can't dwell on the why"

140,"I think some straight women have the perception that they are like gay men because gay men in the media are portrayed as stereotypically feminine and open about their sex lives (which is obviously not the case). It definitely makes me feel uncomfortable and I've met some of these women - but these women are usually ""fag hags"" and are looking for a gay person to act as an accessory rather than a human being. It's sad."

142,do it. get it out if the way. you'll be free to do what you want to do without having to keep a big secret from someone you spend half the day with... 
143,Renly!
144,I (top) was shocked when I made my bf cum hands free by fucking him. My anecdotal based theory is that the more comfortable we became (with time) the more everyone relaxed and truly focused on the pleasure of sex/love making. It's become a huge turn on and secret ego booster for me if I'm honest. I try really hard to make him cum from bottoming and knowing I'm pleasuring him so immensely is  probably more important to me now than my own orgasm.
145,"Oh absolutely, that was one of many red flags in that date. He's kinda psycho. He still texts me every now and then.

But damn, he's hot AF."

150,Please hand in your complimentary dildo and gay agenda binder on the way out. Thanks! 
151,When i was 17 I was banging the minister of my parents church. It was one of the only times I was the top in the sexual dynamic.
152,Learn to not invest too much emotionally until you're more than a few dates in. You're just getting to know each other at that point and shouldn't expect much.
153,"It's a gay subreddit. Correct parent is your dad, unless your parents are lesbians.

Anyway, first guy I has sex with was horrible at sex. He had more experience than me, yet somehow the rookie was better. He must not have listened to any advice, or ever had anyone correct him on the mechanics of gay sex. He was terrible about prepping himself for anal. One time, I'm trying to finger him and I felt a bullet in the chamber, so to speak. That was a show stopper. He kept trying to get me to continue, and I'm like ""Fuck no."" I wasn't even horny anymore.

He gave blowjobs with teeth. Cue full body cringe.

He rushed me into sex one time and I thought he'd given me a fissure, but luckily I was fine. Sharp pain upon entry, which I'd never experienced when we popped my cherry or since, because I always take my time stretching or tell the other guy to take his time. If you are patient, you shouldn't have much pain unless the guy is a fucking pornstar.

Pretty much every time with him was a disaster. I was a rookie, and didn't know any better. I thought I liked him enough that I could get over the awful sex. Then, as we spent more time together, I started seeing more about his personality that I hated. When we broke up, I was relieved. I was angry at first because he ended it with a text, and I'd convinced myself that I spent so much effort in this that I loved him. A week later, someone asked me how I felt and I said, ""Like a free man."" Felt fantastic. "
154,Yes. The first time I did so I ended up getting a blowjob from him at work... So there's that... 
155,I just said hi and talked about some stuff relevant to the place i was working (a museum) and then segued into more general stuff and then he just flat out said look is there anywhere we can go together right now
156,did you go to school in an anime show
157,"If you've chatted on the app for a while and you see him IRL randomly, then it's not particularly creepy. If you've never had a conversation with him at all, then it's super creepy. "

There's a thing as too tight?"
159,"Look him in the eyes and say, ""you called me a fag in high school,"" as you nut in his mouth. Everyone wins. "
160,"I don't know why anyone would say Trump would promote a wave of self acceptance - particularly when he's based his entire platform on hating everything / everyone.

I should say, I'm Irish and have never been to the USA, so trump may well be a super intelligent guy who's gotten the wrath of the international media. I doubt it, but it could well be the case. "
161,You don't. 
162,"Like I said above, I've never encountered anything like it before or since. If I found out he was some kind of sex cyborg prototype, I would not be that surprised. "
163,"Pissing is one of the more common kinks.  It's interesting you link it to exposing/being exposed, because that leads to all sorts of sexual turnons.

Be careful with consent.  Even other guys who are into it don't want to see it go down in the bathroom at Wal-Mart.  

You should have no problem finding plenty of hot freaks who would love everything from ""catching"" you in the act, all the way to drinking your piss in a bathroom (of your local leather bar).  Some guys get horny as fuck watching you drink beer, because what does beer make you have to do?

For every kink or fetish, somebody somewhere is into it, and even moreso than you.  Lots of people.  Whatever it is, everyone's freak-yings always have plenty of freak-yangs.  

Including your yang, pissing all over them.  "
