1,Yes. I love the smell of your husband's underwear. 
2,Opposite tbh 
3,Bang one and see how you feel after. 
4,Installing Windows Vista.
5,fuck them you're better off going somewhere with your boyfriend
6,"Oh, yes.  I like the belly glimpses better, though, and never fail to check out shorts that might reveal something."
7,"Dude thought he was a wizard. Like legit thought he had magic powers.

I'm not talking about neopagans or wiccans or witches, it wasn't that. I'm talking like, this dude claimed he could levitate, light candles with his mind, etc. Shit like that. Of course he could never do any of it in front of me for some bullshit reason.

But the sex. Oh my god *the sex.*"
8,"There are gay people who once fooled around with girls as well. By that logic, it's pretty easy to deduce that you can fool around with boys in the past and still identify as straight.

Totally normal."
9,"I had a huge crush on a guy who was an aspiring writer, and he asked me if I could read and critique his novel. I said yes because I imagined it would be some beautiful, bonding moment. It turned out his novel was a surrealist, metaphorical, existentialist work of over 800 pages. There was an entire chapter where the protagonist examines the similarities between a white desert pebble and his relationship with his mother. Infatuation made me read that book cover to cover and now I am never going to get that time back."
10,Unprotected sex with a stranger.
11,"Cell phone stays in your pocket, don't fidget or cross your arms, ask questions about him and don't just talk about yourself, keep the conversation light and fun, smile a lot, relax and just have a good time."
12,"You are attracted to who you are attracted to. It doesn't matter whether other people are typically attracted to that ""type."""
13,"I don't really mind fat guys but it's very annoying when they complain about nobody wanting them because they're fat. I have this one fat friend who spends all this time and energy being angry and complaining about how shallow the community is because nobody wants him, but the mere suggestion that he could perhaps diet or work out sends him into a rage and he rants about how people should just stop being shallow and should love him for who he is.

And of course he doesn't date fat guys. But he's not shallow, no sir. Only guys who don't want him are shallow.

Like it's your body, do what you want with it, but don't act like your lack of a sex life is anyone's fault but your own."
14,"It's not funny at all, he's being a cunt.

At some point he *will* out you (and when you have to deal with the fallout he'll be going ""But it's funny!)"
15,That comment was very unprofessional lmao
16,yea ok i didnt come out for nothing
17,crystal meth
18,Gay? Perhaps. Narcissistic? Almost certainly :P
19,Getting gangbanged and destroyed by the school rugby team in the changing room.
20,Is a bottom
21,"When I was 14 I looked at my grandma's ring and said it looked good. She turned to me and said ""when you will get married a guy would buy a ring nice as mine"" then she smiled."
22,"Oh woops, I dropped my monster condom that I use for my magnum dong!"
23,"Both. Especially if youre wearing basketball shorts, jogging pants or sagging."
24,There's a shitload of hypocritical straight guys out there lol.

26,"I like my women how I like my coffee.

I really tried but I just find coffee distasteful and it doesn't give me any energy boost."
27,"&gt;Racism is not an issue in the lesbian community as a lurker here recently found out, nor in the straight community, so it shouldn't be here.

I'd say racism is definitely an issue in the straight community. How many straight black guys are just seen as BBC's. How many straight asian men are completely desexualized to the point of not even being considered by women?

If anything the gay community mirrors the straight community. Racial stereotypes are learned. "
28,"No, PornMD. It's a medical site."
29,Personally I’d dump him and find someone who is more respectful. You’re wasting your life spending time with this guy who clearly only cares about himself.
30,"Anal is painful to be quite frank. I also thought sex was overated after my first try but with multiple encounters it started to feel good lol. 

I also didn't expect muscle guys to feel so hard... It helped relax my obsession with buff guys abit. "
31,You have too much free time.
32,"no. neither do my gay friends.

I'm not ashamed of it or anything, I just don't talk about that kind of stuff with someone unless I plan on fucking them."
33,"The Iwo Jima photo is staged, and it's been parodied many, many, many times before. People aren't freaking out because it's disrespectful, they're freaking out because they're ignorant, scared, and uncomfortable, and they need to grow the fuck up."
34,"I’ve kinda lost track of what all the letters after T meant, I thought that’s why it was now a +.. "
35,Straight boys fucking their girlfriends are fornicators whose sin is punishable by going to hell. Just remind them of this when they brag about pussy. 
36,Stop making out with him in public then. 
37,"Not all, but many seem to think they've been put in charge of dictating to all other gays the correct and incorrect way to be gay."
38,When the attractive ones don't sleep w me hate that! 
39,"That's a pretty normal thing actually.

I had a super big crush on this guy in college. He fell asleep in my bed drunk and I didn't wash those sheets for weeks because it felt like he was with me when I was in bed and I wanted to get closer to him.  He smelled sweet and musky and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
40,"for celebration, may i lick your anus please. "
41,"no harm in looking, it's like when a nice bear reaches for something and I get that glimpse of belly"
42,"&gt; Women don't share photos of nude men

Total bullshit.

&gt; women are more oppressed and stuff

Actually is true

&gt; so people deserve worst penaly if done to women

Back to more complete bullshit

&gt; sure it happens, but I'm saying it because of my internalized homophobia.

She's a fucking loon.

&gt; I'm gay

Gay people can (and many do) have internalized homophobia.

No though, nothing you said here resonates as homophobic.  You met a crazy-bird.  

EDIT: [To everyone who's adamant that women have it awesome here in the west](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ac/b0/04/acb004710dc0f9d619d5c823efe2a706.jpg)

43,"I think Odd Future were a bunch of open minded young black R&amp;B singers/rappers that didn't fall into the traditional gangster/urban scene and I'm not surprised he's the third one in the group that's gay. 

It's also nice to see black queer musicians come out as I'm a gay black guy that's really into music myself. "

45,"Don't even worry about your identity man, you don't have to publicly ""come out"" to experiment in college a little.

Get Grindr on your phone, wait until you see one of those cute guys, and then get your dick sucked my man. Something tells me it'll be wild!

You can 100% be exclusively into hetero relationships and still enjoy a blowie from a guy on the side. You might even find your're interested in banging (though read up before doing this as it is not as simple as it is to bang girls).

The only thing you are obliged to do is to be 100% up front with the people you experiment with, be clear about your boundaries, be really careful to not get some poor gay guy falling for you romantically if you're not ready for that (you're likely not if you've never done anything with a guy before). College can be a tender age for some gay guys as some have not had any experiences either, and might be a bit prone to falling for someone fast. Just be REALLY firm that you're experimenting and that you're only looking for hookups and everything will be A-Ok.

In the end you might find that you're really not into it in which case it's cool, you're not forced into being gay because you experimented. Just be a man, own your decisions and don't let anyone judge you."
46,"&gt;I'm relegating this question only to straight men. Straight woman, as well as bachelorette parties, is a completely different situation/discussion.

The straight men are only there because they're following the straight women."
47,"&gt; mostly centered on sleeping with someone

U think gay clubs are any different? There are guys blowing each other in the bathroom stalls and in the alley way."
48,"Yeah, they know I'm a bottom. Accidentally implied it whilst drunk one time to one of them. Made the others guess and they guessed right. 

They keep telling me I need to ""get dicked"". Not sure whether to be flattered or annoyed. "
49,"I can't even find one guy and you've found four at once :"") "
50,"He does this adorably terrible impression of a chicken. Think of the cast from arrested development. It's as if he has never seen an actual chicken. 

I've always told him it's a really good impression. He is a little bit proud of it. I'm afraid one day he might do it in front of my friends. "
51,"One of the hardest realities I've learned since getting involved with the LGBT and kinkster communities: The weirder they are, or the farther you want to be from them in public, the better they are in the bedroom."
52,"Noticed a group of cute guys at a restaurant and was watching the one with the nicest butt. He stopped his out-of-proportion bubble butt a yard in front of me, facing away, and then he bent over to pick up a fork he dropped.


Also, related, I was driving next to a guy on a motorcycle on the freeway and hoping to see his white shirt fly up. When he sped off, not only was his back beautiful and rippled with those two dimples at the waist, but also an inch and a half of his salmon pink underwear was showing.


Third story then I'm done: my ex has a large butt and he was oblivious to the fact that his butt crack would show whenever he would squat down or bend over, not just a little bit, like a deep crevice. I just admired the view and told him *after* we broke up."
53,"He did tell her, they got a divorce because of it. "
54,At a hotel window watching a guy across the street jacking at the window. We watched each other and gave thumbs up to cum at the same time.
55,This sounds like something that happens when person tries to write a novel before they have enough real life personal experiences to fill it with. They have to keep drawing from the five hikes they've been on and maybe like three times they went to an inner city.
56,"When a hot guy lifts up his arms, I check to see if I can see his tummy AS WELL AS his armpits if he is wearing a particularly tight short sleeve T-shirt! Bonus if there is hair in both places! "
57,"The one that really gets me is the Q. Fuck off with calling me queer, thats what I got called in school and I don't appreciate seeing it bandied about freely. 

And more broadly than that, I honestly think the gender and sexuality movements need to diverge. The needs are different, the problems are different. I'd personally support both, but I think they can't continue to function under one umbrella, they need different things. 

And with the actual letters themselves...there's no discrimination against asexuals so I don't get the inclusion. And 2 spirit is just another term for trans as far as I understand it, so why not just stick with T. "
58,"Finding someone to date.

If I were a straight guy, it's easy to find someone to date - almost any woman. As a gay one, I can't exactly walk up to any random guy and say ""hey want to go out?"" because he may well punch me in the face in offense. Sure, apps and stuff like that can help but I'm terribly awkward on those.

Then again, I'm awkward in real life so that's not really much help either."
59,Horny. 
60,"Nice try, Netflix market research."
61,He wont be there.
62,"That was a great but painful article. 

I think there are much smarter people than me here who will offer better feedback on what we could do about this, but I feel that I should give my stupid high school dropout opinion anyway: kindness goes a long way and it doesn't cost anything to be nice to people. This community needs that, it needs compassion. We need to stop treating each other like sex toys and realize that we're all human. I'm not saying that hooking up is wrong, but rather that there's more to people than their dick or their hole and it would be great for all involved if we could remember that."
63,He's a furry. Run. 
64,You have to push your ding-dong into his Evil Zone.
65,"I dress pretty androgynously, and I wear panties when I want to. People can wear whatever they want. Eat a dick."
66,Ew gross!  I prefer olive or avocado oil. 
67,"The thing is that the fat people that poster was complaining about think that they're entitled to having Andrew Christian/Sean Cody types falling all over them, and complain about those guys not being into fat people while also rejecting other fat guys for their bodies.  You need to raise yourself up to your own standards and a lot of fat people don't do that."
68,"36 here, last time I douched was probably 20 years ago because I was a tiny insecure gayling and I was terrified of poop.

Now I just eat a lot of fiber and shower daily."
69,That sounds cute. 
70,"For the past 8 years or so whenever I'd think about whether or not I'd rather have been born straight, I think about my entire family and just how absolutely bigoted they are, from the top down. If it hadn't been for me being gay, and looking OUTSIDE of my family to the word around me, I would be just as bigoted and monstrous as the rest of my family, and a religious zealot to boot. My siblings wouldn't understand our parents are narcissists, they would never have had the eye-opening of having a gay sibling, and my older sister may well have never figured out she was bi.

I'm pretty okay with my sexuality."
71,"I just found out the guy that I was recently dating considered us to be in a relationship. 

Sure didn’t act like it. He could only hang out once every two weeks. We had just three dates in six weeks. 

I thought we were just in that “guys getting to know each other” phase. "
72,"People masturbate with different frequency. Anywhere from twice daily to 1-2 times a week is normal. It is only a problem if it literally takes over your life and stops you working, going outside, pursuing relationships etc. If you're depressed you may masturbate more, or conversely less. But limiting your masturbation a la r/nofap as an urban therapy is pretty much bs. Masturbation should not be associated with shame or guilt, it shouldn't be made into a competition either of who can masturbate the most or least. It is simply an expression of libido. Making it a competition to see who can abstain the most doesn't seem mentally healthy to me.

The best way to get more energy is to get consistent good nights sleep, to eat a balanced and healthy diet, and to exercise regularly."
73,"Not to me but to my ex.  He told me that he was out at a bar, it got very late, and he got very drunk.  He befriended a guy at the bar who offered to drive him home.  They leave, pull up to my ex's apartment and my ex drunkenly thanks the guy and goes to exit the car.  The guy asks to come inside, my ex declines because he thought he was just being friendly, and the guy locks the doors.  My ex starts pounding at the window and the door handle, struggling to get out.  He eventually manages to break the handle and runs off in the opposite direction of his apartment, so as to throw him off.  He never forgot that guy or that experience.

Fast forward a year or two and I make a bunch of friends at a gaming convention.  Smash Bros. for the Wii U comes out and I invite a bunch of them over to play.  My ex, who was living with me at the time, comes home to all of us gaming.  One of the new friends I invited over walks up to my ex and says, ""Hey man!  You know my door handle is still broken?""

I was shooketh.  **⊙﹏⊙**"
74,"Met a guy in a straight Yahoo chat room. We talked about pussy for a good week on and off. Then I turned the conversation to jerking off and getting head. He told me he hadn't had head in almost a year because his girlfriend didn't like doing it. Eventually after several more hours of chat he admitted that he'd consider letting a guy blow him but it'd be difficult because he wrecked his car and was living with his mother for a few months to help her renovate a house after she divorced. 

We agreed I'd drive over one night at 11PM and follow him into the woods at the dead end of his street. I gave my roommate the address and the guy's screename. Told him I should be back in 1 hour. Drove over, it was a dark street. I parked and flashed my lights as directed. Out of the woods comes this tall hairy sexy man. He flashes a flashlight at me. I get out, quietly say hello and follow him down a path into the woods. We stopped a a fallen tree. He pulled down his shorts leaned against the tree and said in a deep voice ""It's all yours, show me what you can do."" I dropped down hoping he wasn't about to kill me and sucked that big ol' dick. He held my head all the way down on it while he shot a load deep in my throat. 

When I finished, I got up, said thanks and started walking back to the car. He said"" What, you gonna suck my cock and then just leave? You could at least stay and chat a bit."" I did and that started a 15 year friendship. In between girlfriends he'd call and ask if I wanted his load. He finally got married two years ago and I've not heard from him since."
75,Someone who's overweight cannot hold men to a higher standard physically then they do themselves and not expect to be called out. 
76,"While I was in elementary school I would get bullied every day for more than 3-4 years (starting from halfway through elementary, until I finished). At first it was just a few kids from my class, but then it ended up being a lot of kids. It was very often and a lot of teachers knew, as well as parents. Except mine. I never told my parents. I was quiet and I studied and that's all they needed to know, I thought that if I slipped they would start asking why, so I made sure I didn't. 

After word spread around, some other kids would come from other schools to fight with me. There was another school in our area, so after the kids from my class started hanging out with the kids from the other school - they started coming around more often. 

So, I stopped taking the main entrance/exit and started taking the one for kindergarteners (it was a big school, separated in many parts, depending on age groups) or the exit where the trucks would usually come to deliver food. And I would usually walk the long way home, because I thought no one would think of waiting there for me. 

I had very good friends (mostly female, I maybe had one or two male friends) who would always protect me, I would probably not be alive if I didn't have them. Not because someone would have killed me, at least I don't think so, but because I remember considering taking my life away. I got into my (step) dads razors and cut my thumb to see how it feels and it hurt too much, so it scared me enough to not go near them again. 

My friends would sometimes make circles around me so that I could at least get far enough where I could start running. I'm very thankful for them, and most of them are still my friends. 

But the people that bullied me also had ""friends"". They were the older generations that were already in high school. They used to hang out in the school yard by the basketball courts; whenever they'd need water or cigarettes or something, my classmates would go get the stuff for them, that way they had backup and support in case a fight broke out or something. 

So, I had to deal and answer to those assholes too. 

I never felt like I could do anything about it. One day, after one of my classmates just decided to tell me, out of nowhere, that my dad wasn't dead, but he probably left because he didn't want me - I had a panic attack and cried until school staff decided that the only thing they could do is give me some pills to calm down and send me home. 

I spoke up once or twice to the counselor, but that never did anything. After I was advised to not attract too much attention to myself, I found myself with no support. I started doing bad with the subjects I was good with and started doing worse with the subjects I had issues with. Even if I knew the answer I would pretend that I don't and when I would have to go out in front of the whole class, I couldn't focus so I would just stay quiet. 

Even in front of the teachers, while I was trying to do my best to concentrate, I would still be insulted. I felt beyond defeated. 

There's been plenty of instances that I've blocked and tried my best to forget. I've been chased away from my school, I've been scared to walk around my neighborhood. It took me a lot to get over that, but I never really have. I'm still scared to walk around that neighborhood, I still remember things every time I come across these types of threads and even now, while I'm 10,000 miles away from that city, I still can't help it. I'm still truly afraid. 

Since then, I've worked on a lot. I went to a therapist for several years and I think I'm doing a thousand percent better and I actually love myself, I'm also married and have friends and family who are happy for me and support me. I don't know where the kids that bullied me are or how they're doing, but a couple of them got in serious trouble many years ago. One of them was stabbed, the other one either went to jail or has had trouble with the police and another guy was found dead in the entrance of his building. He died of an overdose. I think I cried when I found out a couple of years ago. 

Bullying is a very serious thing, and some people don't make it out alive. And the ones that do don't forget it and often remember various things. I've even had dreams about it, recently too. "

80,"Communication. Communication. Communication. That x10. 

If you truly care for all of them, then this might work. If you do not, you might grow resentful - so that is another barrier I might view as a possible hurdle for you. 

I also suggest you ease yourself into this relationship. This is new to you, so you must be open to concessions and they have to be too. By introducing another individual into a 2 way, then a 3 way, you're making this many more times complicated.

This also means that you cannot have a ""favorite"". You will need to put time into the guy you like the most, and the guy you like the least. Any fracture can end in a massive mess, which means that you need to NEVER keep a lie from another. I cannot put enough emphasis on this, even a small thing like preferential treatment between two guys will lead to a fracture. Especially if one of those guys, the guy on the shitty end of the stick, likes you a lot.  "

1. I didn't choose to be gay. I believe I was born that way. Which means that god made me gay.

2. As an infinitely good being, god shouldn't make someone gay and at the same time find it as a sin.

3. It means that the holy book is in the wrong, which is not surprising, since it was created by mortals.

4. God gave us the ability to think and to distinguish good from evil. Why would he do that if he wouldn't want us to make a use of it?

5. Loving a person of the same sex is not harmful to anyone in any way. Why should I consider it as a sin?

134,I'll make a call-out thread about you too! 
135,"so, basically, you've found him cheating more than once and you keep going back.
"
136,"I like my coffee like I like my women.

Nowhere near my dick."
137,"I wasn't expecting getting fucked to hurt so much, but I also didn't expect blowjobs to feel so good. "

139,"1) I thought this post was about financial status until I saw the replies. :D

2) Isn't that what the ""Poz"" tribe is for?"
140,"This is true. On the other hand, I used to think I was weird but after getting involved with the community I realized that I'm actually pretty average and my ""deranged kinks"" are laughably vanilla too.

Wait this probably means that I suck in bed though 😂"
141,"Depends what you actually mean by ""muscles"". Like I don't care for bodybuilders, don't care about six pack abs or whatever, but if there's no muscle definition *whatsoever* going on I probably won't be interested. I like fit guys."
142,"Seriously, the idea there isn't racism in the straight community - on what planet? (And I'm pretty fucking skeptical that lesbians aren't racist.)"
143,Gossip like high school girls
144,Rape
145,"Being completely humiliated and verbally abused by a very successful, much younger guy while I worship his feet so that I am reminded of  how I haven't accomplished anything in life. I'm thinking of seeing a therapist..."
146,"If you live with your mom or financially rely on her, I'd take his advice. "
147,"Or maybe say ""Who the hell are you? Can't a guy use a bus station urinal without being proposed to?!?!"""

150,that's reasonable. Give it a taste. 
151,"I like smaller guys, ideally around 5'7'' to 5'8''. Guys that size are really easy to throw around and manhandle during sex.

Plus cuddling a small guy is one of my absolute favorite things. I'm 6'4'', so I can easily hold them in my arms with their head resting in my chest. I love making him feel safe and protected in the arms of his man."
152,And all of reddit. 
153,"I know it's more of a gay marriage thing but...Dealing with legal and public matters. 

Like getting a lawyer. I'm asked if married and when I say yes, I'm asked my wife's name. When I say I have a husband and give his name, it's always awkward. 

Same thing for in person meetings for banking stuff, city hall stuff, etc. It noticeably disturbs people when I say I have a husband, after they've asked me about a marriage related question.  

I'm not gay married, people. I'm just married, and well, gay."
154,Being hateful and spiteful to others in our community.
155,Bound and blindfolded in a restroom and being forced to blow random dudes and get peed on while they call me names. 
156,"I never look at a guy's bulge, not only because it does nothing for me, but because you can never see anything unless he's wearing WAY too tight pants. Same mostly goes for his ass. 

I, personally, look at a guy's arms a lot, and his overall frame in general. If they're visible, LEGS. "
157,"&gt;I started to seem needy.

You are needy.  He was just a guy on Grindr and you're buying him flowers and shit."
158,Im good thx

160,People mistake me and my brother for being lovers :(
161,"ok, here is what you said:

""People can wear what they want, it just makes me angry [*pisses me off*] that they do it. But also, it doesn't matter to me. This thing that doesn't matter to me makes me angry.""

sorry to break it to you, but it appears that you're kind of dumb maybe"
162,"Orgy in the restroom of a highway rest stop with a bunch of redneck truckers, grunting and cussing while swigging whiskey from a bottle and smoking cigars while we fuck."
163,I can relate. I legit had massive image issues. Then I went on Grindr and discovered it was in my head.
164,"Like fuck their son in the ass!

:p

Kidding"
165,"congratulations, if a guy proposed to me I'd probably hyperventilate or cry"
166,I (25) switch between being ok and accepting it to going into a deep depression.
167,"I can see why

I feel like I'd get fucking *ripped* on for being a bottom, I'd never hear the end of it if anyone knew.

"
168,"Total opposite reaction. Getting fucked was mostly painless (he was somewhere between average and small), and blowjobs did (and continue to do) nothing for me despite being hyped up in every piece of media and social circle. "
169,"Oh man...  When I was a horny frustrated teen, I wanked it at the relay for Life one time.  It happened to be being held at my high schools football/track stadium.  I was in a tent on the football field.

So basically I wanked it on the high school football field during a fight against cancer fundraising event...  It was at that point that I knew I was going to hell, if heaven and hell existed.  😂😂"
170,"The fact that it won't go in is telling you that it's too big for you right now. That is not what I would call a practice dildo.

"
171,"I think your dad is advising you base on what he would do if he is in your situation.

If he had mostly socialised in homophobic environment his whole life, it is understandable why he would say that. Because when he puts himself in your shoe, he would never come out to co-workers or random friends.

The thing is, you are the one who actually gets to socialise with your co-worker and pick your friends, so your risk assessment should be more sound and accurate than your dad's.

I think it really comes down to experience gap. Your dad is doing the best he can but just keep in mind he may not have as much information as you do.

Nevertheless, I think he genuinely cares about you."
172,"Mine was ""I go to Whole Foods for my homeopathic remedies."""
173,It's so dumb that they limit your blocks. Harassment is way too rampant
174,"Grindr actually give me confidence but it also made me realize that many gay guys do not seem to possess the ability to commit to fucking anything, even if its as simple as setting up a hookup."
175,Who the fuck are YOU?
176,Maybe the sex was his magic power.
177,"Wow. Taboo. Never speak of this to another soul...


Sometimes I feel you people forget that we fuck via the shitter-hole"
178,"I wasn't into this guy, I just wanted a quick hookup because I was working straight for three days into a QFT takehome exam and was going insane. After the usual stilted talking, we decided to watch some show to make things less awkward. He told me he wanted to watch the Great British Bakeoff on Netflix.

Never again. 

I shrugged it off with a ""whatever"" but while we were having sex the show kept rolling and he would continually make these terrible, cheesy dessert-related puns in time with the show (and in connection to whatever we were currently doing), and I even caught him glancing over at the television multiple times, as if to keep up with the show while were going at it.

My friends and I refer to this story as ""Swiss Rolls""."
179,The flat earth society has members all around the globe. 
180,I'm so glad I'm gay. Not having to deal with gender roles and masculinity is a blessing 
181,"Not always the case. When I first came out and had no gay friends my straight buddies used to go with me to gay bars to show support and help wingman for me. 


Plus, who doesn't love extra strong drinks and upbeat dance music?"
182,"Good luck, and don't fuck it up."
183,"Once I was talking to my gay friend, the only really close one I have in real life, and he told me that he has a new boyfriend. I asked how they met.

He told me: ""Actually, that's a funny story, because... I have no idea, haha. I went to the bar and I remember barely anything. I woke up another day in his apartment. It was the biggest hangover of my life.""

They are still together, but we still think he got drugged and raped..."
184,"Being cuddled by a guy. That's right, I've never been cuddled :("
185,"Well, some guys are just total tops or bottoms... You can't do nothing about it - it's their preference. Would you like him to do something he doesn't want just for your pleasure?

Incompatibility is a serious issue in gay relationships. You either match yourselves... or you don't. If you're not willing to adjust, you may find yourself at point where your relationship will end because of that.

People in situations like this often open their relationships, but that's definitely not a solution for everyone."
186,"I checked out the discussion on hip hop heads and it really blows my mind that there's basically not a single actually homophobic comment on it. When i was growing up, the hip hop community/culture was still *extremely* homophobic and that seems to not be the case as much anymore. Like i'm sure there's still pockets of it here and there, and it still might hurt a rapper's career a tad, but not to the extent that it would have 10 years ago when i was in high school when ""no homo"" and ""nah i ain't about that faggy shit"" and black people thinking someone being gay automatically made them incapable of being ""hard"" and ""gangsta"" was at it's height. Man i got so much shit from ""my people"" back then... So it makes me feel some type of (positive) way to see that thread and see all the positivity and support for Tyler from a hip hop community (Assuming he actually is coming out and it's not a character or something). It's just really cool to see shit change like that."
187,"Not really coming out, because I consider myself ""out"" to everyone on the planet at this point, but I recently met a guy and he made a big fucking deal about it. 

We were having a conversation about dating and I casually mentioned the men I've dated. He goes, ""What are you gay or something???""

I say, ""Duh. Anywa--"" 

He cut me off and said, ""I KNEW IT! I COULD TOTALLY TELL!""

Mind you my being gay isn't something I make a huge deal out of anymore. I've been out for over a decade. I thought this guy had never met a gay man or he was just shocked because he kept remarking on it and suddenly my sexuality became the entire focus of our interaction. 

It wasn't until afterwards that he smiled and said, ""Well the truth is I'm *trans* and it's just nice to meet people from the community since I don't meet them that often."" 

Once he said that, and mentioned he only transitioned recently, I was like oh okay he's just *excited* because he feels comfortable around me. But at first I was like dude chill the fuck out lol."
188,"They were really great, and they felt bad they thought I had to hide from them, then I felt bad. I still can't believe I told them, haha"
189,I possess a primal desire to shove my cock in boyholes.
190,"definitely the dating pool

my straight friends and family used to give me shit for online dating, but it's like, when gay men are only 5% of the population, I don't live in a gay neighborhood, and I need to find someone who fits all the criteria of attractive/attracted to me/sexually compatible/shared interests, the chances of just randomly locking eyes with someone in a book store are next to nil"
191,Gross.
192,Take him at his word. A joke.
193,"A hooker in Marrakesh, had to give him an extra $100 not to stab me."
194,"She said ""when you get married to guy"". She's met my boyfriend last week and loves him."
195,"&gt;His ex was was super muscular compared to me

I hate how you took this serious post and boiled it down to physical appearance."
196,"""Religion of Peace"" lmfao"
197,"Ok, OP you're making it really difficult for us to incorporate this into our fantasies here..."
198,"&gt;When i was growing up, the hip hop community/culture was still extremely homophobic 

It still is. Everyone on HHH is white though."
199,"In addition to the sexism, so many straight men and women alike look at the other sex like they're a different species, with unknowable motives and fundamentally different mindsets, it's bizarre. "
200,"Not in a committed, romantic relationship until mutually agreed just like not married until a proposal, acceptance of the proposal and a wedding of some type  takes place first. "
201,"Guy A already passed you over to be with someone else. It didn't work, so he came back to you. 

Guy B is just being real. 

Don't endanger Guy B for a chance with Guy A who already bailed on you before. "
202,"The most insightful comments are, of course, from lesbian/bisexual women. 

&gt; I really liked the article, but I don't think that you're getting to the root of the issue. As an out lesbian, I have to wonder why my experiences of growing up and finding my community are so different from yours. Gay women are still superficial, still behind our straight peers, still very depressed and traumatized and anxious from years in the closet, but our community looks very different from this. It makes me think of that study about how men with wives live longer than women with husbands. You say that in Sweden ""men married to men have triple the suicide rate of men married to women."" Women are raised, and expected in our society, to do a lot of emotional labor for the men around us (our ""future husbands"") and boys aren't taught to do their own. Of course, this ""works"" if you end up straight, but for gay men, I could see this being a disaster. This isn't an innate feature of manhood, it is what we teach our children to do. By not teaching young boys how to process feelings and take care (and be gentle!) to the people around them, we are setting them up for a life of either relying on girlfriends/wives/friends to help process their emotions, or in the case of men who mostly hang out around men, lives with no emotional outlet at all.

&gt; Hi Riley, I'm a Bi woman and totally agree with your comment! The whole time I was reading this article the phrase 'How the hell am I not surprised by this but all these gay men are? Men are not brought up to talk about their feelings, even *feel* their feelings, so when you're a man who loves men... you're basically fucked. Just like so many women who are straight, constantly carrying these stunted male humans who can't communicate, and are trapped by the patriarchy's ridgid rules for masculinity. No shit straight women who are married aren't as happy as straight men who are married! Blows my mind how tragically separate everyone is.. I was thinking, hey, I'm a single woman who would love to watch movies with someone without having to be their partner, just be great friends, support each other because we'd like company and a real human bond. Maybe a new app in the gay community could be friend hangouts for single women rejected by straight men and single gay men rejected by men? "
203,"It's much more than just going up and down. Feel his body, make sure he's enjoying it, motion is key, look him in the eyes, whisper in his ear, I don't want someone just laying on top of me sliding in and out, If I'm topping, I'm pining him down, holding one hand, various speeds and depths.."
204,Hope those men aren't driving after swigging whiskey in your fantasy

207,"I feel like I'm reading something I wrote at age 12. Please tell me
You're still in middle school...

212,"You don't have to have sex or date them, neither do I, but why attack them?"
213,"Holy hell I know you're 17 but fuck dude this was hard to get through. Such a condescending and trite post that tries so hard to be academic. Stop trying to make everyone's pride yours, get Grindr in a year, and get the fuck over it."
214,"&gt; ... is he straight

hahahahahahahahahaha, no.

"
215,"So is gluttony, fat ass. "
216,Being very submissive to men that attract me.
217,"Not the same. We may look at the ass but there's definitely less emphasis on it. 

It's not all about the dick. We also get to see muscles, beards, confidence, hair, torso, pecs, biceps, tris, smile, strong jawline....etc."
218,Lol lesbian trade agreement would be dope. Both get kids that know their biological parents and all medical shit
219,I'll tell you how I worship my bottoms. 😏
220,"Me being an employee somewhere that requires us to wear suits and sucking my bosses cock for a promotion while he wears a navy blue suit and black cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. We leave our suits on the entire time and I cum on his boot and lick it off after getting his load.

Ugh..."
221,"&gt; Like getting a lawyer. I'm asked if married and when I say yes, I'm asked my wife's name. When I say I have a husband and give his name, it's always awkward.

Whenever this happens, I just give them my husband's name and let them connect the dots. If it makes them uncomfortable it's not my problem, it's their problem and they need to sort it out. I'm not there to kiss their booboo, I'm there to get shit done and get on with my life."

223,"Straight men are ruining gay bars. I come to gay bars to have a safe experience having fun and whatnot. It was the last safe bastion that, if you flirted with a guy, it was a guarantee that he'd be gay. 

Now with all straight guys coming in, I no longer have that. I still have to worry about who I'm flirting with. I once asked a guy if I could buy him a drink and he got all offended because he was straight. Wtf. "
224,"If you really think the entirety of gay culture is ""yas queen"" and drag then that's more your fault for not diversifying your company."
225,I fight edginess with edginess. It's not productive but it's relaxing.
226,Both to be honest lol
227,It's relatable :/
228,"Our community is a lot bigger than you think. Gender and sexual minorities (GSM) go beyond lesbian, gay, bi, and trans people. Everyone that is not cisgendered and straight should be included. The full acronym would be LGBTTQQIAAP2S+. I think we should all stick together and be inclusive. If we want to eliminate discrimination we need to embrace intersectionality and make sure that everyone feels accepted in the community. Personally I prefer the term GSM or LGBTQ+. I would rather avoid the alphabet soup that is created when we try to include every single possible identity. Anyone should chose whatever term they prefer to use and are more comfortable with."
229,"Oppressed is oppressed. Yes, there are different severities. Nonetheless, being oppressed isn't a good thing. "
230,Cure anybody's loneliness and sadness with my cuddles.
231,"&gt; [Racism] is not an issue in the lesbian community as a lurker here recently found out, nor in the straight community, so it shouldn't be here.

Lmao you're delusional. Racism is alive and well in the straight community. I'm in the midwest and there are many guys here who are openly racist, would refuse to date a black girl, etc.

I cannot say for certain how racism affects lesbians, but to pretend there isn't any bigotry or bias is to be willfully ignorant."
232,"I'd nominate Chechnya, or 90% of Africa."
233,Fucking without the goal of procreation or strengthening a spousal bond is fucking for lust. Please have them hand over their contraceptives and child support payments.
234,"This sub isn't racist. People (like yourself) come here with an automatic chip on your shoulder and boohoo when someone isn't physically attracted to a physical characteristic you posses.

You and many others cheapen the true meaning of racism by thinking someone rejecting your on an app is racist. It's not. "
