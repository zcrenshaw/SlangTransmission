THEN GET THAT DICK."
1,He remembers me. And is up for a meet up!!!
2,"As a wise coven of sage women once said:

""If you wannabe my lover; you've got to get with my friends. Make it last forever, cause friendship never ends."""
3,"I'd tell him the truth, it'll probably make you guys closer and the truth is important in relationships and trust. Don't wait too long I guess idk "
4,"Ok guys, we met at the bar and got a booth, we talked about school and catching up about what we did after I graduated, we also talked about ""geek"" stuff, he is very passionate about Marvel , he kind of avoid talking plainly about sex when we were at the bar, but it was still an awesome time, the waitress got kind of pushy to get us to leave we were there so long. So because he walked there i drove back to his place and that's when he started coming out more, as he was feeling me up while I was driving and getting me to do the same, it was great. When we got to his place we started making out, again great. Things progressed from there, he said he wanted to take things slowly but he was good with me sucking him off. So that was a slight disappointment but I still got to blow him, he's slightly above average in length and above average girth it was beautiful thing. I left his place around 1 because he said he had work things he needed to do early this morning, not sure if that's a bad sign or not. But over all I had a great time "
5,"If a stranger/friend asks me I always say I'm gay.
But if it's my family I awkwardly smile and say no then vanish into thin air."
6,"Intimacy is scary as hell, isn't it?"
7,Gay people who obsess about how other gay people live their lives.
8,You're lucky your son is a better man than you are.
9,"I have to concede that QAF hasn't aged well, I tried to watch it a few times on Netflix and relive the excitement from when I watched it in college. It's nearly unwatchable now, it seems absurd. And for that, I am grateful. 

**You have to put QAF in context**. *It's almost 20 years old*, and since the US version was based on the UK version, I think it really is 20 years old. I feel so remarkably fortunate that I was in college around 2000, because the world was genuinely changing, and I feel young gay men, just 10 years separated from me (the Grindr generation) have NO IDEA how different life was, and how to a closeted and terrified 19 year old college boy in 2000 going to school in deep east Texas, that QAF was a lifeline and a revelation. 

The men just 10 years older than me were social pariahs who had to hook up in bathrooms and parks, risking their lives doing things that would get them arrested. If you wanted to be truly out and gay, you almost had to move to the gay neighborhood in a huge city. 

This is NOT a criticism of the Grindr generation, we are SO happy for you. My husband and I have lots of friends in our social circle who are in their early to mid 20's, and it's impossible to express how happy we are to see the young gays having nothing but ""normal"" problems like everyone else, without also having to wrestle with the anxiety of oppressive social stigma. A huge reason QAF doesn't hold up today is the world is so very different. The storyline of Michael being a closeted grown man working in retail seems so absurd now, but in 2000, it was reality. 

So, when you watch QAF today as a young person, think of guys like me who are in our mid-30's now, we were watching it in our dorm rooms and apartments, with the volume turned down low on our 24"" tube televisions, terrified our neighbors would hear it and find out we were faggots. And think about the men just ten years older than me who were actually an oppressed minority. 

Life is amazing, guys. Be grateful for it. It's the best time in human history to be gay. "
10,"You DID dodge a bullet. People like that are emotionally unstable, they'll invade every fabric of your life and likely cry suicide when you try and dump them. 

If a guy can't handle a few hours or a day between texts it's a good indication to steer clear. 

"
11,He wont tell me what hes into yet he wants to meet in public first 
12,"I have no real solution but I think SRS is not the answer. Not only none of you would want to do it (or would regret it for the rest of his life), but you will also lose the very reason why you're together: you both like guys, not women. Don't make any decisions that you know you'll regret."
13,Ok everyone we made a plan to go meet up at a bar close to his place like about 13 miles from me. and we'll go form there. Thanks for all the encouragement. I need to go get ready now   
14,"""No, I don't think my boyfriend would like that"""
15,WE GOT A FIVE ALARM DICK FIRE OVER HERE. SEND LUBE. 
16,"This reminds us that ""sexy"" is completely subjective. "
17,You're like a gay Moses bringing water to all these thirsty hoes
18,CODE RED!! CODE RED!!!!!!!!!!! He answered!!
19,Be 100% behind your son. Stand up to the Mom when ill remarks are made and be the bridge when she becomes accepting. 
20,"I hope you find the courage to leave Iran, and NOT mutilate one of your bodies with sex reassignment surgery.  There are large Iranian communities here in the United States, and I have a friend who is somewhat closeted from his parents who are more traditional Iranians, but he's out to his sister and cousins here. . . . and he had a boyfriend for 4 yrs until recently when he moved to a different state for medical school  
Anyway, I know the US accepts asylum seekers from Iran, especially for homosexuals.  I'd take you in myself if it came to that!!!"
21,We are going to need a follow up!!!
22,"&gt;He also told me that he prefers that I hang out with the girls and he thinks that's awesome because a guy hanging out with other guys, that's everyday life but when a guy is welcomed by the girls it just shows how trustworthy he is that girls are happy to have him around even when they're exposed or vulnerable.

This is bullshit. People get exposed and vulnerable when they're around close friends. Doesn't matter the gender.

But hey, thanks for the update, at least you're not bothered anymore."
23,Why do people assume masculine men are putting on an act?
24,"He clearly cares about you, can tell something is off, and is concerned. Open up and talk to him. Once he hears the awful shit you've been through I guarantee you he will completely understand why you felt like you had to lie the first time."
25,"I was not a fan of you and still scratch my head at what you did, but your son deserves a happy end, so I am happy for this update. 

you wrote him a letter apologizing for your mistakes, well, since the communication channel has been opened, keep on doing this. Keep on writing to him and make sure he knows how you feel. How did you felt when he came back, the joy, the happiness, the guilty. Open your heart to him, tell him about your wife death, how much it changed you, the first realizations that you made a mistake, the momment you knew that disowning him was a disgrace and how much you regret your actions, how much you thought about him all the time. He wants to trust you, so he needs to know you.

Also, now is time for financial payback. Yes, you kicked your son in the streets and he was on his own since he was 16. His siblings had the luxury of being financially protected until their young adulthood. Sit down with him, ask if he has college loans, did he acumulate any debt from the years on the street? does he plans some post graduation education? offer to help him, , offer to pay for him, you own this to him. You own wayyyyyy more, but at least you can show in a concrete way that you want to make things right.

Any way, just tell him that  a bunch of people on the internet are happy for him. "
26,"Im here, my Dick wont calm down, and I think im on the verge of hyperventilating. Wish me luck "
27,You didn't dodge a bullet. You're the Titanic and you dodged the entire arctic shelf.
28,"The straight guy obsession.

I had straight crushes,i will most likely have some more, but holy fuck, i never thought that a guy touching my shoulder meant ""Blow me in my sleep"" and i never wanted to convince a straight guy to have sex with me, some dudes (specially here) seems borderline insane when it comes to straight guys."
29,"[This guy ](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/67/5e/ec/675eec2e2bc1012d51ea9f6ef5279121.jpg)

31,"Maybe I'm na√Øve, but I still think many of us don't fall in love for the money. My boyfriend also uses his hand for a living, and honestly, that's exciting. I'm not looking for a fancy life, he's coming back home after busting his ass and I'm quite admirative. He's doing his job, he's good at it, and we just live a happy simple life. 

I wouldn't date someone who takes his job too seriously and let it influence our lives. My carreer goal is to open a food truck with him. 

I want to work to pay bills, get shit done, and once I'm home, I'm home. I intend that my boyfriend does the same thing, or at least leaves job problems at work or that money doesn't become a problem between us. 

I don't need a porsche to be happy. I value time over money, and I intend to spend as much time as I can with my boyfriend. I think whoever takes money too seriously and want to afford fancy things misunderstood what life is about.

Ofc don't get me wrong, if you enjoy your job and make a lot of money, good for you. But a lot of people are miserable but continue their depressing jobs because they want a nice car and fancy restaurants. Fuck that, I'll drive a shitty car and I'll use my free time to learn to cook like a chef myself."
32,"I am out of high school, senior in college. I did message him, so nervous!!!!"
33,"A lot of effeminate guys start life by trying to act less effeminate to stay in the closet. Once they come out, they stop acting and let their real personality show. This makes some people think that the effeminate qualities only showed up when they came out so they think the new personality is an act."
34,"Be supportive of your son as she is going to take a long time to come around, if ever.  My mother stopped talking to me, so that is an option.
"
35,"The love/hate relationship with masculinity. I've had guys tell me ""I only go for masculine guys I'm so glad you're a frat boy""....and then I've had guys message me shit like ""you're supporting the patriarchy. Your masculinity is so fragile. Haha toxic masculinity"". 

Like what the fresh hell...."
36,I'm a statistic!
37,"My father pulled the same on me, devout Opus Dei saying he was going to actually kill me to save me from the torment of Hell. 10 years later and he's asking for forgiveness because he has stage IV cancer (that's what my mother tells me - they're divorced). 

Would I forgive a monster who abused, hit me continously and said I'd be better off dead? Fuck no. 

I moved countries, got a Bsc and a Msc, married the most wonderful man and we live happy. Fuck those who in God's name preach hate and intolerance. "
38,"I will any and all things he does. He's my son, his happiness and health are paramount. Whatever makes him those things makes me happy. 


Not having them talk is what I want to avoid. I think it'd crush both of them honestly. 


Sorry about your mom. "
39,"When there's another guy there (i.e. a real person), you can *bottom* for this guy. You can actually get *dominated*. You feel his strength, his control, his will. He feels your submission, your hunger, your willingness. These are primal erotic sensations. The joy of anal sex is not just in the mechanics, but in the powerful interpersonal dynamics between the two people doing it. You don't get this with a cucumber!"
40,Don't upload any photos or conversations with the guy. You don't want this coming back to bite him somehow :)
41,I am still waiting on Jake Gyllenhaal to message me back.
42,A SMART HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER DOESNT TALK ABOUT SEX WITH STRANGERS ON THE INTERNET. 
43,"I was the target of a childhood fantasy which was then fulfilled. A guy I worked with at an office supply store would hit on me openly all the time but he fucked women basically every day (seriously, total slut - no shaming). I figured that he was just joking around and didn't make a big deal about it. 

I move out and quit the job while at University and end up at a party he's at. I'm drunk, he's high, we fuck for a few hours and after he cums he falls over and curls up next to me and tells me ""I've wanted you since I was 16"". I was just kind of silent, he was a nice guy and all but not someone I wanted to date permanently. 

The next day I crawl out of bed and head to work (still drunk... not fun) and I don't hear from him for a few months. I see him at another party and he tells me I'm the only man he's ever been with and thanks me for fucking him, he then goes back to making out with his female trick of the day. Weird dude. "
44,"That's 100% not how it works. I've represented gay Iranians in asylum cases. He would get asylum if he entered the US and applied. It's trivially easy to do so (once you have the means to get to the US (or other countries with similar or better asylum policies)) from countries that actively enforce the death penalty for being gay.

The difficulty is arriving in the US, etc. But asylum is much, much, much easier to get than refugee status.

If you do find your way to the US, please contact [Immigration Equality](http://www.immigrationequality.org/) as soon as you get here. They will find you a Farsi/Persian translator and an attorney (for free--either one of their in-house attorneys or a pro bono attorney at a law firm) and assist you throughout the asylum process."
45,"Oh I'm 1000% behind my children. And she's never said anything ill or negative towards homosexuals, but she doesn't believe it's who he is. But to me it's like denying the ground is wet in the middle of a thunderstorm. "
46,Oh damn that Chilean president 
47,The person attached to it &lt;3
48,"I mean, it's also gay sex, so I'd say the chance for birth defects is zero"
49,"Hi there. Homosexuality does not *cause* HIV and AIDS. You are not more likely to get HIV just by being gay. HIV is usually passed on through direct exposure of the virus to the blood stream. So unprotected anal sex puts people at risk, as does sharing intravenous needles, unregulated blood transfusion and so on. Gay men who engage in these activities are not more likely to get HIV because they are gay. Straight people are just as at risk. 

Other kinds of penatrative sex can also be risky, including vaginal and oral. Probably because of cultural reasons, HIV is more common among gay men in the west. In Africa HIV is predominantly found in the heterosexual population. Gay men didn't invent HIV and they don't cause it. 

It's possibly helpful to seperate homosexuality, which is a sexual orientation, from the other sexual activities you mention, which are sexual fetishes. Your sexual orientation is not a fetish. Also most of the other activities on your list are non-consensual and, in the case of pedophilia especially, cause great harm to others. This can't be said of homosexuality. These days many people believe gay people are born that way. For most gay men this is how they feel - that they were born gay. For the vast majority of gay men being included in a class of sexual deviance that includes pedophilia hurts them deeply - if you think about it it's not hard to imagine how it makes us feel. 

Hope that helps. "
50,"&gt;  He's my son, his happiness and health are paramount. Whatever makes him those things makes me happy.

You are an exceptional father. Thank you."
51,"I'd probably be killed or fed to the hounds afterwards, but I'd try some Ramsey Bolton dick. lol he's really sexy "
52,Wtf I didn't see that trick in the gay manual I got when I came out. 
53,Everyone thinks they're the sane guy
54,"OP, this is what dreams are made of."
55,Im 5 years out of high school
56,"Lol, have you heard about ad blockers? I haven't seen an ad on youtube in years. "
57,not sure if I should but yes he is extremely fucking hot. And hes gotten better with age
58,"&gt; he said he wanted to take things slowly but he was good with me sucking him off.

My god. This is what it means ""to take things slowly""!?

I'm happy for you though! :D"
59,"The above quote is very condescending, like something a parent would say to a six year old.

"
60,So I had a friend named jessy h. (girl) and a friend Jesse h. (boy) and they had a baby that they didn't name Jessey. Fucking waste. 
61,"The whole 1-10 system is bullshit. I prefer the binary system: 0 if you wouldn't fuck someone, 1 if you would. It really gets down to the essence of things. 

I'd fuck me. "
62,"Looks like an 80s prosthetic werewolf. The shoulders and back are kinda weird, but I love the chest hair‚Ä¶"
63,"This is may not be the best advice, but maybe you could find a lesbian couple going through the same thing as you? You could be each other's cover. You could all live together or something - that way you might be able to adopt. Might be pretty extreme, but still less extreme than permanently changing your body in a way that neither of you want."
64,Go to a clinic?
65,"All of those Dothraki men, God their pecs are to die for."
66,If you put your ear to the screen and listen very carefully you can hear them discussing anal douching and how to tell if my str8 friend is into me. 
67,Wtf. Getting rimmed is awesome
68,"It's good to hear your son has so much compassion and understanding and I'm glad he's willing to build a relationship with you after all these years.

On another note, those of you writing rude and hateful things about OP over his past actions should really be more understanding and compassionate. Having grown up in a christian household, I spent most of my childhood knowing I was gay and thinking there was something seriously wrong with me because of it. If I, someone who actually IS gay, can make the mistake of believing the hatred and homophobia taught by so many religions, how could I judge anyone else for doing the same? 

It is impossible to bring about a culture of acceptance, particularly for those who are LGBT, when we as a community are so unwilling to forgive others ourselves. That kind of hate towards adversaries of acceptance, in all it's irony, only further alienates us and causes more intolerance. It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes, written by author Beau Taplin, ""We're all so desperate to be understood we forget to be understanding.""

What OP did was truly terrible. Even so, for me to judge him when he's already so harshly judged himself isn't just overkill, it's hateful and it's wrong. Congrats to OP for his genuine remorse and honest attempts to right a wrong. I believe the world needs more people willing to courageously accept responsibility for mistakes of such enormous magnitude. We should be thanking and praising him for his actions TODAY, not scorning him for wrongs made long ago that he's already trying to make right as best he can."
69,"I purposed a small arduino and battery into a little cleaning device that stays in my butt all the time except when having sex and pooping. On the way out and in it squirts a load of lubricant, so it moves with ease. That way I'm always loose enough to take it, and I'm squeaky clean. "
70,"How about ""I appreciate you sharing your opinion, but I respectfully disagree."""
71,Not really. I'm more turned off when guys send me pics of their asshole... Not their ass. Their ASSHOLE. 
72,Knowing that I made it go from soft to hard 
73,When you and your bro tag team dp a girl and his jizz drizzles down your shaft so he has to clean it up with his tongue but ends up going down right when you bust so you accidentally give him a facial and then y'all realize you forgot to say no homo so now it's full homo 
74,"Probably at the Eagle in Portland when I disclosed my trans status to a dude and he didn't believe me, so he decided to jam his hand down my pants to confirm.

That was pretty weird. "
75,"Other guys who refer to themselves as ""fags."" I find the word so derogatory and negative to call ourselves. It always makes me cringe when I hear it...I've never understood that one."
76,"I wonder what kinds of mental gymnastics this guy has to jump through to maintain his belief in all that nonsense. Surely he's tried to ""hex"" people before, and nothing happened, yet he still thinks there's something to it.

I'd have noped out of there at the first mention of the word ""chakra"" or finding out he's serious about his horoscopes."
77,"I always show pictures of my bussy to the kids at the end of the year, so they can identify it when they see it on scruff 5 years later and talk about it to horny strangers on /askgaybros "
78,"Well... personally, sounds like a crock of sh!t to me.  But it doesn't matter what we think.

Glad you're happy."
79,"I usually say, ""No, I'm gay""

Gets all the awkwardness out in one burst. Or if I have a boyfriend I'll say ""No, I have a boyfriend though"""
80,Being added to the federal protected classes. I don't understand why marriage equality was first over workplace protections. I've applied for several jobs only to realize afterwords they don't hire gays.

82,"Think about where you'd be if this wasn't available... if there was no internet to see an example of everything you needed to know about. If all you could do is maybe go to a bookstore with a gay section... of you lived in a big enough city to have one.



Keep this in mind; coming out has never been more easy. Before this, there wasn't much way to connect with other like-minded guys. Many were on their own. It was tough. Never forget that. Much of the ""gay culture"" developed out of an era without internet or ability to connect and see other gay people. 


I'm happy you have these (Reddit and other) resources and anecdotes to use. They will serve you well."
83,"They turn me on a lot, it's like a picture frame for your butt. "
84,You dodged multiple bullets matrix-style
85,"Tell him the truth. Everyone's life experiences affect what they do and don't like, and opening up about it to someone can make you feel safer and happier. He may be a good match for you if he's able to read you so well :) I doubt other people can see that in you. I think it's great he's been able to and then been open enough to ask. It's intimate! 

Wanting to avoid him is a sign your past makes you uncomfortable and you're kinda wanting to avoid it, which now means avoiding him. Face up to it and you'll feel better. Own it. It doesn't make you less of a man - going though that shit has made you more of a man, and opening up about it will do the same again. "

89,"It sounds like he's giving you bs. I get that everyone needs time away from their spouses. So, why does he feel the need to drag you along just so that you get sent to a different room anyway? If he wants time alone, he could just go by himself. Maybe you'd rather spend that time hanging out with people who aren't so disrespectful instead of his weird friends."

104,"I was backpacking europe and ended up in copenhagen. I made a rule with myself to not sleep with anyone while traveling. Still managed to somehow contract TB, although it's been latent and now I'm on meds (sorry, irrelevant).


At a bar in copenhagen, a handsome gentleman approaches me from behind as I was ordering a drink. He places his hand on the arch of my back and says hello. I'm immediately smitten.


He then slides his hand down my pants and pretty much touches my asshole. As I react, he wipes upward and places his finger in his mouth and says, ""delicious"".


This was after a day of swimming and hiking. I was far from clean, anywhere. "
105,"A lot of people really struggle to get past the idea that a person's sex can differ from what they were assigned at birth. 

I won't call it bigotry, although for some people I'm sure that's what it is. Ignorance is probably a better word. The popularised image of a trans woman is one of *either* totally not passing, or fully passing, but usually with a penis. Anyone who knows real trans people knows this is a) not true, and b) totally irrelevant. Trans people don't have to fit into anyone's binary definition of sex. 

Then, people tend to simplify sexuality into attraction to *genitals*, which is incorrect. I like so much more about men than their genitals. So much more in fact that I wouldn't care *that much* if a guy didn't have a penis. Others might see this as a dealbreaker.

Tl;dr: mainly ignorance and heteronormativity.

Edit: okay, I revise my previous position. There is definitely bigotry in this thread. "
106,You can't ask that question without sharing first yourself.
107,"At your age, it probably presents a greater roadblock than it will later on. I know people who have built successful landscaping businesses and who do quite well financially. But, yes, at age 20, college students tend to be most interested in each other and others on similar career trajectories. "
108,"OMG getting fucked in the ass by a real dick is so much better. You don't have to ""worry"" about holding it in and pushing it yourself, someone else is doing all of that for you! A real dick is also more malleable and so it bends and contorts to your insides. A big dick hitting your prostate just right will make you cum like a straight boy bottom bitch! "
109,"I'm 6'4"" and I prefer guys that are shorter than me. My first love was 5'5"" on a good day, realistically probably shorter. We flip flopped roles and had a lot of fun with that. 

What annoys me more here is that your BFs friends are basically bottom-shaming your BF and that your BF is actually bothered by that. There can't be any tops without bottoms and no ones masculinity is compromised by taking it up the ass. I've been in those situations and I find simply making a deal about it does wonders to end the bullshit. 

Example:

""Ha ha, you're a bottom, lol""

""Yeah, and it turns me on. Your point?"" Directed stare, raised eyebrow zero smile.

""Uhhhh, nothing.""

""That's right"" change topic, move on. "
110,I'm afraid the ones that don't find a charitable benefactor to supprt them until they die are melted down and made into glue. This should have been in your *Introduction To Homosexuality* pack. Read the smallprint at the back.

112,He was on his phone in the theater? Nope. Next.
113,"Seriously. Honestly, since reading the original post, I'm still furious at OP. I'm happy for his son, since it sounds like he's happy. But frankly, OP doesn't deserve to have his son in his life, and it's upsetting that he gets forgiveness for something which is (in my opinion) unforgivable. "

115,"Parents who bully their queer kids need to be charged with a form of child abuse, and gay conversion treatment must be banned.

Both of these - definitely the first - would probably need to be a state-by-state thing."
116,Ill update y'all when the date is done
117,"That's fucking awful, I'm sorry you had to experience it."
118,"Hello, I'm a transman, and I'll try to answer your questions. You should also consider cross posting this to r/ftm. 

1) It doesn't change anything, don't worry.

2) Not talking about his transition in front of other people, or pressuring him too much about his past all at once. And like the other user said, ask about pronouns.

3a) This is what confuses me... 3 SRS (sexual reassignment surgery) procedures? That doesn't make sense since there's only 2 procedures that result in creating male genitalia. Commonly, the first procedure transmen get is top surgery (getting their boobs taken off), but this conflicts with 3b (see answer to 3b). Wait, before surgery there's HRT (hormone replacement therapy), so that's what he probably means. He's probably been taking testosterone for now. He probably has a vagina still, though it doesn't hurt to ask privately. Other procedures are a hysterectomy of some sorts, phalloplasty (creating a penis from a patch of skin from arm or leg and other things, usually able to penetrate), metoidioplasty (also known as a meta; can be a clitoral release, create balls, move the urethra, etc). 

3b) He's probably wearing a binder to obscure his chest in hopes of it looking like a male chest. Which means he probably hasn't had top surgery.

3c) No, a prostate is found in male at birth individuals only, in case you didn't know, the prostate aids in semen. Since people who have vaginas do not create semen they do not have a prostate. He can top with a strapon as well, he may be okay bottoming from the vagina, or he may want anal sex. That is something you would really need to talk with him about.

I hope this was of some help, but really communication is number 1 in this situation. Don't come in with any preconceived notions about how he feels about his body, and everything should be okay. Also, reading threads on /r/mypartneristrans can be helpful as well."

120,"There's a generational divide. 

Older guys had to wear jocks for PE and sports, so they spent their adolescence seeing all their straight crushes put them on in locker rooms. 

I'm a millennial and only ever see jockstraps in gay porn and on go go dancers. 

I bet you'll see a lot of gay dudes with compression shorts fetishes in a few years. "

123,"The guy I was planning to marry cheated on me with someone he met on Grindr. We had an apartment, finances, and lives pretty intertwined. I'm glad I found out when I did, despite that it hurt, a lot. A couple weeks after I left, he had a total break down and pleaded for me to come back. 

I normally forgive when forgiveness is due/earned, but forgiveness also entails that I have to trust you again. And for me, cheating is the ultimate betrayal. I couldn't trust him anymore. 

He jeopardised his health, our relationship, my health, and violated my trust. Luckily I didn't catch anything. "
124,"Wildly inappropriate as grabbing someone's dick is, it's not like it was traumatic or anything, just pretty wtf. My boyfriend and I just kind of looked at each other, bewildered, and started laughing. We'd been thinking of inviting him back with us (hence why the subject came up in the first place) but figured that little stunt was a pretty good sign not to bother. "
125,It looks like he shaved them so he'd look more socially acceptable in clothes.
126,it means the wearer has *no* imagination. 
127,"Ugh, OP-- that's awful and I'm sorry.

Me: 18 years old, with a 30ish guy I met at a Pansy Division concert at the 1993 March on Washington.  I found him on Scruff a few weeks ago, and we are messing around again after 23 years!"
128,If he's good looking and willing to let me suck his dick (or willing to suck mine) then I don't care about these silly percentages or social mores.
129,"Oh boy. Where do I begin. At a bar in the upper east side I guy wouldn't stop talking to my friend and I. We were nice so we continued the conversation. He was really drunk and kept going on about how much money he had and how he's 52 and doesn't have any work done on his face (which he clearly did). Then the owner of the bar comes up to him and says he has to leave. The dude was like ""uh why?"" Then the bar owner said ""you took a shit on the floor of the bathroom that's why. Now if you don't leave I will call the police."" Dude left and the bar owner gave us a round of drinks. Now plenty of weird things have happened in the eagle. The one that made me angriest was some kid who just graduated from Princeton and was rubbing it in everyone's face that he went to an Ivy League school. He was piss drunk and nobody liked him. He got really sloppy and started acting like a total dick to everyone so I got security to kick him out. But he just dropped to the floor crossed his arms and was like ""NO! I'm not going"". So security had to drag him out like a mother dragging her screaming child who's throwing a temper tantrum. This was really weird because usually at the eagle everyone older and knows not to act like a fucking child. And then there's many more stories. NYC is an interesting city. Brings out the best and the worst of people.  "
130,Yes. People have varied tastes. You just need to keep looking.
131,The thread is about a fellow gay man asking for advice about how to escape a legitimately dangerous situation. Do you think it might be possible to focus on that? This isn't the time.
132,"I have suggestion that is slightly less fucked up than an SRS. You can have a Marriage of Convenience (MoC) with a Lesbian couple and move to different part of the country where you won't have relatives meddling into your affairs. I think, there are websites for this specific purpose,so, you can google and check 'em out.

Edit - This suggestion is intended to be taken after other options, like immigration, have failed. Please, don't be hasty making a decision this important. Good luck"
133,"An 18 year old may have more ""experience"", but the brain doesn't stop developing until the mid-20's and you likely have plenty of other kinds of life experiences that someone in or recently out of high school hasn't had yet.

In the end, everyone's path is different. So what if I'm in my late 20's and have only ever been with two guys? My man is a keeper and I've got a great career, my own place, and debt-free financial independence."
134,That's an insult to black women 
135,"""I don't usually call him that, but who am I to judge, right?"""
136,"I can only speak for myself (not a drag queen but as someone who likes drag), but I see it as a form of theater or performance art. In fact that's how it even started; men doing women's roles in plays because women weren't allowed to be actors.

Drag isn't always about looking like a straight up woman, you have some drag queens who do conceptual looks, androgynous looks, or who mock/exaggerate beauty standards to an extreme degree. 

To me it's no different than someone choosing to express themselves through dancing, painting, acting, singing, etc. Sometimes those are all even combined. 

As for why it first became associated with gay culture it's because before we really knew what transgender was, drag was a way for trans people to express who they were. They were social outcasts and transgressives just like gay people were, so we had that much to bring us together. 

And of course some gay men just think it's fun to do. I did drag once for a charity event and there's something just *different* about wearing makeup, a wig, a dress, etc and feeling *pretty* as opposed to feeling *handsome* as a guy. I can definitely see the appeal of it. "
137,"I don't understand why being gay needs to be the cornerstone of your personality. People like to brand themselves as being gay as though it's a badge of honor, when in reality it wasn't something they chose to be. I can understand why it's something to be proud of in the face of oppression, but people oftentimes use the fact that they're gay as the first interesting fact about them."

141,"A higher concentration of emotional trauma, leading to drug use to cope. 

Also, in some places, gay clubs are seen as the only place to meet gay people, and as safe zones. We all know that any type of night club is going to have things going on there that aren't entirely kosher, including drug use. When you're constantly around it, it's harder to resist. You try it once and nothing bad happens, so you do it again, and again. Eventually, you need more of the drug to get your high. Before you know it, you're addicted. 

Some drugs, like heroin, are instantly addictive. I haven't tried it, but I've heard meth is really addictive as well, and meth use in the gay community is on the rise. When you're on meth and having sex, you generally forget the condom, [which helps spread HIV.](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/12/nyregion/beast-bathhouse-crystal-meth-use-gay-men-threatens-reignite-epidemic.html)

It's a lot like when guys describe themselves as ""attractive"" in their descriptions. It's like, if you are, then people should just be able to tell by looking at you."

151,"Guy on grindr hits me up commenting on my profile pic. After chatting a bit, I find out that he's a big a nerd as me. It got to the point where his friends dragged him out to a club but he was texting me the entire time. We end up meeting for a lunch date. Turns out he's even better looking in person and we really clicked. 

About a week after our date my  coworker of mine gets a part in a play in New Orleans and leaves for two and a half weeks making me work close to 55 hours for those two weeks. Also in that time I get a second job to make some extra cash. This was also during the end of the year holidays so I became super busy. Wasn't able to meet again for a while and didn't get to text him much. After things started to calm down for me I text him asking to meet up for dinner. Well he gets back to me and tells me he's now in a relationship. I was hurt but there was nothing I could do about it. I've learned to balance work and relationships better now but I still think about what could have been there."

157,"Be patient and kind and funny. Make him laugh. Touch him from time to time so he doesn't feel like he's just hanging out with a buddy. Do a little low-key flirting, tell him he looks good. Pay for his lunch/dinner so he feels like he's on a date. Just little things like that."

Seems like OP's husband is trying to - as much as I dislike this term, it seems appropriate -  heteronormalize his relationship and push OP into a feminine role, just to fit into social situations with other straight couples. It's also kind of ironic that he prefers OP to hang with the girls because he's more feminine, but has the audacity to tell his friend off and make him apologise for doing the same thing. "

- your account is two months old with no karma, primadonnaAF's is five months old with no karma

- despite neither of you ever really using Reddit, you have been PMing him and also coincidentally live near him  

I'd love to be proven wrong because you're a sick fuck if I'm right (or maybe you're doing a thesis on Reddit communal response to tragedy!).

175,"1) AIDS is caused by a virus called HIV. Just about anybody can get it.

2) Letting consenting adults get married regardless of gender is not at all the same thing as relaxing all moral standards, even though that is a long-time anti-gay talking point. Gay people, by and large, are just as disinterested in sex crimes as anybody else. In fact, if you look at who is committing sex crimes, usually it's straight men. Maybe we should outlaw that for a while and see how it goes.

3) And yes, these things you're struggling with are super homophobic. There's no shame in that as a starting place--I grew up in a place where people believed both of those anti-gay smears--but as an adult you should want to move beyond that starting place.

Good luck to you."
