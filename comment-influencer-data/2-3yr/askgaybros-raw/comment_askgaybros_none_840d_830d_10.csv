0,"years before we met, I was in a relationship with a guy who was pretty much my first everything... he died unexpectedly from a brain aneurysm when we were both in our mid 20's.

my SO knows all that, but what he doesn't know is that the guy drank diet Dr. Pepper all the time -- it was the only thing he drank other than coffee and water. every once in a great while, when I'm feeling nostalgic and missing him, I'll drink a diet Dr Pepper myself because it reminds me of how he'd taste when we kissed."
1,I like how your best memory is like their worst memory. This totally seems like something from a gay version of Bojack.
2,"This cute guy Austin and I were looking at gifts for a friend's birthday party in Dallas. I spent the *whole* day flirting with him, but he did not pick up a single thing. My favorite moment was when I got to drop him home. 

Me: I know I'm going to be in Dallas this weekend, maybe I can be in Austin too?

Him: That's stupid. You can't be in two places at once.

...About two months later, we were staying at a hotel in Dallas for a concert, and he asked if I was flirting with him back then. I got to be in two cities that night."
3,That would be when I was in 9th grade and my neighbors' house burned down one night. The hot dad i guess just ran out asap and was outside in his white dad briefs watching his house burn and his huge bulge and ass was all out there for all the world to see. Can't even tell you how many times I jerked off to the memory of that
4,"Honey I am the urinal.

(jk don't pm me, I know how y'all are.)"
5,"Guy asked to shower with me once to save time before we go out to the movies. We were just close friends and I thought he was just trying to be practical 

Yeah... I'm the biggest idiot ever lol"
6,"Good luck, it's a classy story yet it could be from a porno, have fun and stay safe!

Edit: we need dog pics as a cute tax"
7,"we have a hot tub outside our house and my parents were having a party with their friends

i was about 15 or 16 when this happened. i was already asleep with the blanket over my head when this 6""3 naked hunk bursts the door open while drunkenly looking for the toilet

i saw pretty much every angle while he was inspecting my closet before coming into the conclusion that a pile of clothes was indeed not the toilet.

he put the lights on and saw that this was my room, followed by with ""oh shit"", cutting the lights and getting out"
8,"Most people focus on the sex.  But to me it's the political that made the most difference in my life.  
Being gay made me an outsider, therefore I appreciate other outsiders.  Being gay made me a minority therefore I have a greater affinity for other minorities.  

Because I am gay I rejected religion and explored other religions.  Because I am gay I have a great respect for women and what they go through.  Because I am gay I questioned everything I was taught.  Because I am gay I'm skeptical, I ask questions, I don't assume.  

It isn't just about cocks and butts.  "
9,fine ill give you a blowjob
10,Boyfriend got arms
11,"I got concessions while he got seats for the movie. I get there and he picked the very top left corner far away from everyone else. So we're watching trailers and he looks at me and smiles, and I look at him and smile back. Then I look back at the trailers and ended up falling asleep during the movie"
12,"&gt;I don't want to feel like a side piece or a secret.

You aren't a side piece or a secret.  The men he's hooking up with *are*, and not mentioning you to them keeps them from feeling that way.

13,You never ever have to worry about accidental pregnancy. 
14,Masturbate in workplace bathrooms.  
15,I'm a western gay...and I dislike all religions.
16,"There are these two classically good-looking college jock types who I always see at my gym, usually in those really revealing cutoff tank tops.  A few weeks back, I was wandering around looking for a piece of equipment I wanted and found them in the closed, dark spin room sitting on the bikes with no shirts and flexing at each other.  No idea what the backstory was, and it is kind of more magical not to know."
17,"The shower room at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland üòç

The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa in which you're required to shower naked before you enter, for hygiene reasons. Iceland isn't uptight about nudity so the showers have zero privacy and you can see EVERYTHING with zero effort. The lagoon is a very touristy spot and always packed so I'm pretty certain I saw at least 1 dick from every country in the world."
18,"Looking at bulges. 

Esp at the gym.

Too easy"
20,Why are my eyes sweating
21,"I'm not sure if my situation is up to your level but it's definitely way easier for me to befriend girls. Guys make me nervous, especially the hot ones. "
22,In before obligatory pic request. 
23,"time to break up with him, no good morning texts are an absolute deal breaker "
24,"I took this guy to a skating rink on the second date and spent the entire session teaching him how to skate. Had a nice dinner and bubble tea afterwards. We chatted a lot until we got to the subway station. As I waved him goodbye he leaned his face forward for a kiss, and I just...turned around and left. 

I cringed the entire way home after I realized it."
25,"For me, I don't feel it at all except in the form of really, really wet farts afterwards. I know you asked for no silly answers, but this isn't one. "
26,"Swimming at a river with a couple friends. Will call the one friend Mike.

Mike was swinging on this rope swing and did a dive off where he went head first in the water and lost his trunks. He had always been beefy, but had hit weights more that year and was losing weight around his waist. So he had already been complaining that his trunks were fitting looser. I noticed that before he did though since he was always my type and was only getting hotter that year. The trunks kept hanging just enough to see the top of his crack and then showing off he didn't shave in front.

So he dives off rope swing and trunks show up on top of water. He takes a minute to recognize what happened and starts to laugh about it. I jumped in as fast as I could and grab the trunks. He starts swimming to get me, but I throw them to my other friend on the shore. He dunks me a few times and then just says fine he'll stay in the water and it feels good. I can't see too far in the water, but get a blurry flesh color below his waist in the shape of a good ass. That was really exciting.

Mike yells to our other friend it feels better without trunks and he should jump in commando. Then he tries to wrestle me again and take my trunks. He can't get them cause they're on tight so I undo the drawstring while he's trying to wrestle. Then they just slip off and he cheers like he did it and throws them on shore too. 

So we start pressuring our other friend to join us naked. He was skinny and shy but was a few beers in by then. He didn't have anything to be shy about though. He tried to cover himself getting in, but couldn't even cover it with one hand.

We swam for a while and then I tried to convince them to dry off laying in the sun, but they really wanted their trunks on again. Didn't get a lot of looks out of the water, but mike did have a great ass. We all had shrinkage otherwise so wasn't a lot to see in front and everyone was keeping that covered because shrinkage."

43,It doesn't sound like he's a happy moron or that people are taking advantage of his good nature.  It sounds like he's simply decided he's not going to let shit bother him; good for him.  I wish I could be more like that.  It also sounds like he's very considerate of your feelings.  So . . . maybe just enjoy it?
44,Sounds like real life to me based on comments in this sub.
45,"When I was 14 I wound up at a christian summer camp. Both of my counselors were hunky college jocks who were always casually affectionate, which fascinated my not-yet-admitting-i'm-gay self.

61,"It's nothing special, but I just love when he comes back home wasted. Alcohol has a different influence depending on a person - it can make you gloomy, sleepy, agressive. My SO, on the other hand, becomes a complete goofball.

Once he showed up in the middle of the night, giggling without any reason, red on his face and loud as hell. He get on his knees and he was babbling something about how much he missed me. When I finally made him to go to bed, I started undressing him. Of course, his brain told him that this is a sign of incoming sex. He became a big, strong, laughing octopus trying to get me with kisses and hugs. After a really long fight, when we both were (FINALLY) lying in bed, he decided that it was a great moment to tell me some retarded jokes and a story about his friend. He was so drunk that none of his words had any sense. Then he tried to get me into sex again, telling me how much he loves me and asking if I feel the same way. (‚óî_‚óî)

I had to cuddle him to sleep so he would finally shut up.

I can't say that it wasn't annoying, but I really liked this anyway. Mostly because drunk people can be so intimidating, agressive and abusive sometimes. Many ""friends"" of mine suggested that he's the type of a guy who's going to beat the shit out me sooner or later, just because I looked at him in a ""wrong way"", and yet here I was, with a big, silly, snoring bear, who wouldn't hurt a fly. ‚ù§(ÀÜ‚å£ÀÜ‘Ö)"

But later that night when we were trying to pass out next to each other and I felt his hand slide over my crotch and I did the same to him and then we started making out and the mutual handjobs...that was awesome. "

72,"I had this one guy I was trying to be friends with. He called me at 12 in the afternoon wanting to hang out. He picked me up, and I went to lunch with him. Later he wanted to hang out at his place by the pool. I agreed and we got some vodka with some mixers and smoked weed by the pool. As evening approached he wanted to go out to the local gay bar for happy hour. We had a few drinks and laughed about our stories. We ended up stumbling home drunk and stoned walking through the park back to his place. He asked if I wanted to spend the night at his place since I was a bit tipsy. I didn't live far so I told him I would walk home. It was during the night I got to my place that I realized what he was trying to do. ""oooohhhhh..."""
73,"I used to play with this married guy who swore he could feel the cum exploding in his ass.  I doubted it very much.  One time we were playing and I had successfully avoided shooting a load in round one.  That usually means round 2, 3 and sometimes 4.  

I could tell he was getting tired and sore so I faked an orgasm.  He always shot his load right after I did.  He shot his load, we collapsed and he immediately started talking about how scalding my cum was.  

Sorry bud, there wasn't any cum but you go ahead and believe you felt it.  And that it was scalding.
"
74,"I was sitting at a bar a while back and looking at Grindr out of boredom. A guy messaged me and started a convo, and soon after asked me where I was. I didn't give him specifics and steered the convo away. He kept asking and I noticed his distance kept changing, getting closer and further away then closer again. This continued for several minutes, each time him getting closer. I figured he was trying to figure out where I was and turned off my distance and signed off. "
75,"No. You are right to be annoyed. There is a school of thought which prescribes that everyone is bisexual but chooses to label themselves straight or gay based on either social pressure or on the fact that their attraction to another sex is so miniscule they may as well be straight or gay. However there is virtually no clear empirical evidence to support it. It's a thought. 


And he has no right foisting his ideas of what is true and not onto you. I can imagine he's the kind of guy who would only support his ideas and not try to listen to you if you have a counter argument which is perfectly valid. The education system rewards people who can support their own ideas well, not necessarily if they can acknowledge and also support the ideas of others.

76,I didn't mean smell your *own*.
77,"Talk to him, outside of work (so you are not forced to spend the next X number of hours together), and tell him you are feeling curious about guys. See how he takes that news.

He went to take a shower after coming home from a workout, but I was using the bathroom, so... you can probably imagine my face when his butt ass naked self opens the door without knocking. "
89,I think the sub has just hit a new low
90,"&gt; Turns out he pretends he's single. He says it would be too hard ""explaining"" me to the guys he fools around with and it would ""limit his pool"" if these guys knew he about his straight girlfriend.

This is rational behaviour. If he considers these guys just pieces of meat to get off with, why complicate matters. Being honest with them would in fact indicate he thinks of them as more than a piece of meat. In a way you should be pleased.

I clicked on this to see how to ""avoid"" being raped, but this lacked that information. This, to me, is about finding your comfort level and expressing it, not necessarily how to avoid rape. "
94,"IMO, don't end your marriage plans over this. The clothes are just 'things'. You both share fault in this situation. You knew the clutter was a problem and agreed a month ago to clean it up. He shouldn't have been short tempered and threw your clothes out. You could sit down and let him know to consult you before doing something like this again and you could consider being more timely when you agree to do something."

100,"A huge portion of my social network today is built around people thinking I was propositioned for, and had, a threesome with Icelandic women.

I had just started an exchange semester in Europe. I was fairly well liked in my course but not very popular, but a lot of the very popular group from my home university was on this exchange as well, and we were all out at a night-club.

Strangely enough, I ran into two girls (Icelandic, incredibly beautiful) who I had befriended at a hostel a few weeks prior (when I was travelling before the exchange started) and we grabbed some drinks, but this was away from where my friends could see.

Later on in the night, I was dancing with pretty much all the exchange students (about 30 of us) when the two girls walked right up to me to basically say goodbye and that they were leaving. Because of the loud music they were getting very close to me to talk, and these women were already quite touchy-feely to begin with so when they were talking over the music in my ear it would have looked rather intimate. Then to say goodbye they each gave me a hug and a quick kiss on the lips (they knew I was bi as we had gone to a gay bar in another city so it's not like they were attracted to me, and they were also a bit drunk, probably just a very Scandinavian way of showing affection??)

I asked where they were off to next and they mentioned this club that I actually wanted to go to myself, and they very enthusiastically said that I should come with them, so I then left my friends (who were watching this whole thing happen), went and got my jacket and walked out of the club with the two women, each of them holding one of my hands. We went to another club and partied then I went home.

Now I did notice all the looks of shock and amazement from my friends at the time, but I honestly didn't know why until the next afternoon when I rocked up to drinks at a park and they all applauded as I arrived and kept asking questions about the 'threesome', and how impressed they were with my game that these two insanely beautiful Icelandic women would just walk up to me, kiss me, and just proposition me for a threesome, which is what they thought had happened.

Now I'm not proud of this, but being in the closet at the time (I've since come out as bi) and realising that suddenly the whole popular group was hanging on my every word, and realising that these women were never going to find out, i went with the story. Rumour spread fast, even when I arrived back in Australia people knew, and I had a newfound respect, confidence and popularity, and made many new friends, all based on a complete misunderstanding and me not being totally honest in clearing it up."

Do not apologize for what you are doing and have it clear that it is THEM who has to get over this, there is nothing you need to change or put up with, you aren't going to budge as you are 100% in the right."

114,"When I was 16 I started going to the gym on my own and the sauna would always be my favorite part of the whole thing. When I was swimming, I saw this guy looking at me. Instead of being creeped out, I was feeling confident and let him check me out. 

When I was in the sauna, I decided not to wear a towel around me and wear tight briefs that would show off my bulge and ass. I had a bottle of baby oil with me, and I was hoping that guy would join me. He did. Strangely he wore a folded towel which helped me see some of his balls. He was quiet but I started striking conversation and offered him some of my baby oil. Before he said yes, he stood up and openly but briefly opened up his towel to readjust it but that was the first penis I've ever saw and it was amazing. I didn't know if that was a hint or just accidental. "
115,Yes.
116,"If someone tests negative for HIV, don't take them aside and give them ""the talk"" about HIV prevalence in the community, available treatments, etc. before telling them their results.

117,"Sometimes in the middle of the night I like to cover the ground in olive oil and legos by the side of the bed, find a pissed off cat, and toss the enraged cat on him while blowing an air horn for a solid 30-40 seconds. He wakes up rather flustered, he doesn't like when I do that. "
118,"Jesus fucking Christ, this anti-labels bullshit is getting WAY out of hand (facepalm)

Guess he's nervous about making things official with you and all (after all, 3 months is still a semi-short time in the grand scheme), or maybe he isn't ready to be monogamous yet. I suppose continue seeing him if you want...but don't ditch the condoms just yet if you know what I'm saying.

""Things go downhill once you label them?"" What the ever-loving tits does that even mean? o_O"
119,"I'm so sorry that you have to go through this. The saddest part of this story is here:

&gt;What we had wasn't real, because I don't matter to him. I'm the second one, I was the side piece.

You're not the second one at all. I truly believe that he loves you. But his love is weaker than his fear of revealing the truth about himself.

You need to get rid of him, friend. Block his number, don't open the doors for him. Be strong and firm.

Don't say that you wasted time. It wasn't a waste. But you have to move on anyway, because you'll never be free with this man. I believe that he lost his chance to be with you, now when he'll have a baby.

I am really sorry. I hope you will find the love that you deserve."

128,"I used to just straight up tell my mom I was going to get some dick. She would just say, ""Well be safe you nasty slut."" I love my mom. "
129,"Yes. It is like they have some kind of weird definition for Gay. 

Like ~~GAY~~ ASSMONKEY PORN STAR IN TRAINING"
130,"Thanks, bitch. "
131,"I have, he hasnt. He said he feels awkward now to be the second child telling them, but oh well, has to be done. Its great that we have each other though to rely on"
132,"While I'm sad for your marriage, and I really hate to see it being destroyed, I'm proud of you and I'm super impressed that you were able to resist his attempts at gas-lighting you for several hours. SEVERAL. FUCKING. HOURS. Wtf. 

You have a strong mind and a strong sense of reasoning. Whatever happens next, I know you'll make the right choice. If you give him another chance and he attempts to cheat again, I trust that you WILL find out no matter how hard he'll lie next time. 

Be strong. "
133,Let's not sexualise everything we do with our friends. 
134,Why would they lol. Macho studs have plenty of twinks to choose from.
135,"Oh, I've definitely been there. It's a tough situation, but I think very common for long-term relationships. I am sexually attracted to my current boyfriend luckily, but I am secretly hoping he'll lose some weight because his belly is too big for my preferences if I'm being completely honest. He's got a beautiful face, a great ass, and a nice strong back to make up for it though. "
136,Every day I try to say something nice to my husband. Every day I compliment him. Every day I touch him in a loving way. Every day I do something nice for him. I try to make him feel like the most important person in the world. 
137,"I don't know about you guys, but using Grindr or Scruff to find out how far you are from them. I had some guys interested in me, they would send me messages asking where I was, or what I was doing several mikes away. Even my last ex did that to me before we started to date. I think it's a bit invasive to be asked where or what I'm doing if I'm not in my normal range. "
138,"If you're far far away from home and don't have family members where you are now, it's like a 00.01% word will somehow reach all the way home. 

I put my picture just cause I'm not usually one to initiate convos on Grindr. People wont initiate a convo with a faceless profile. But hey, if you're the one who starts convos, then just say ""Hey, how are you"" and post a picture right after that :) "
139,"No, that's creepy."

I've had guys/girls interested and ppl have said they think I'm cute/pretty but my self esteem and confidence is non existent and I think I'm the ugliest person in the world.

141,"Hate to be the bad guy and the unpopular opinion.

143,"I was around 14/15 and went to Spain with my family and 2 family friends. Anyway one night, we had the balcony doors open as it was really warm (as you'd expect) and I'm sat on the balcony with my dad and mam. The balcony next to ours is connect but angled so you can see right into the room, in which a woman is sitting at a desk with her laptop in nothing but a silk gown. Around 2 minutes later her boyfriend/husband comes up right next to her in his boxers then walks away (not seeing us) only to return a minute later about to close the balcony doors with his boxers removed and a huge erection. He looked shocked, and immediately closed the balcony doors. 

The next day, we pass him in the lobby whilst on the way to pool. He just kept looking at his feet as he walked on by. "
144,"""I'd fuck me so hard."""
145,"&gt;not as much as her husband

fucking LMAO

about the gay -&gt; perversion thing... traditionally, i think gays have always been portrayed that way? like, ignoring the whole love part and skipping straight to the debaucherous sex. i dunno. maybe in the next 20-30 years people will see it differently."

148,Hell no. That's a quick and easy way to ruin a friendship when you know the guy is straight.
149,"Read this yesterday.  Although I agree with a lot of the authors points, I do think that this paints an unnecessarily grim picture of gay life in America (and the West more broadly), and also paints with far too broad a brush.  For example, I don't walk at night with paranoia because of my outfit choice or hairstyle, and I don't dwell that much on the fact that millions of people outside of the country would like to see me tossed from the highest building.  

Also, things like the kiss cam might make my eyes roll, but it doesn't leave me red in the face or with my head spinning.  "
150,"Uhm, didn't you read the pamphlet? The Gays ultimately seek dominion over the inferior straights. "
151,"This is how I see it.

______________________


&gt; [My name] your rejection we found very difficult to deal with. 

*You are forcing us to choose between our child and our beliefs.*

&gt; It made us question our purpose in life and hurt deeply.

*We somehow made it about ourselves being the victims.  Your feelings are irrelevant.*

&gt; We have loved and supported as we still do, being gay doesn't change that. 

*We are hoping that saying that being gay doesn't change you that you will bypass our past actions and guilt you in forgiving us without second thought.  This will save us from acknowledging your homosexuality, your relationship, and avoid having uncomfortable talks with you that questions our belief system.*

&gt; The person you are being rude and hurtful does. 

*Again, we made it about ourselves and still ignoring your feelings.  Hopefully you won't noticed that we never mentioned about you finding a guy who makes you happy.*

&gt; Looking well in photo. 

*Thank you for reminding us that this is what our child would have looked like if he was straight.  Again, I hope you don't notice that we made no mention about the person you are with.*

&gt;  If there is anything you need just let us know. Lots of love always. Dad and Mum.

*Hopefully our response will force you to guilt yourself in dropping your ultimatum and remind you that we are still your parents you have.*"
152,"Navigating a job separation 101:

ONE: It is non productive to live in the past, but people need to grieve. - Find ways to process this. Write your story down, Write all the things you loved about the job, Write all the things you hated about the job and then, with some ritualistic method, Burn the pages. Grieve, feel the pain, so that you can move on. 

Two: While you are writing, also do a ""lesson's learned"". Identify what you can that is true, verifiable, and pause and think through your end. Discuss with your paper what you can learn from this experience. (Don't be too detailed, don't use this as an excuse to beat yourself up)

Three: Write about your entire life. Childhood playmates, first bike, what ever. Put this into context. See that the job has been short term compared to the years that have gone into forming who you are and what you can offer. 

You are not broken, you have been broken up with. It was a dysfunctional relationship where they were not as committed as you were and you need to move on from this with out avoiding the feelings and ""freezing"" the pain. 

Boss / Employee dynamic is a significant relationship to most people, but the economic necessity of work and subsequent compensation tied to life tends to elevate the importance of this primary relationship improperly, especially to men. 

Your relationship to your work is about YOU and what YOU DO, not about YOUR BOSS and how you relate to THEM. We spend years honing our skills and adding to our bottom line as a producer of some value add to a company. This really has nothing to do with a boss you report to and who dictates the administration of work assignments and timekeeping et cet. 

You are a professional, you do what you do because you enjoy it and are good at it. That can change, you can pick something else needed by someone else to attempt. Lots of info here, but when you look at it from that standpoint it encourages you to view the relationship between company and employee symbiotically. WE are both Necessary. 

I am sorry you are depressed, and sorry things went badly. Walk it off and get your mind right, Summer is here, enjoy the sunshine, be upbeat and positive before you look for a new placement. 

Good Luck Bro. "
153,"&gt; Sent me to a therapist to try and turn me straight

Was this in Ireland? Or where?

Homophobic parents always try and pretend that you are the problem, and that's what they are doing now.

I'm sorry, but there is not one grain of love or concern in that message they sent. You being ""rude"" and ""hurtful"" is you a) being gay, and b) refusing to do exactly as they want. 

I'm really sorry, but they are a waste of time. Don't introduce your boyfriend to them, and certainly don't ever contemplate introducing a boyfriend as a ""friend"". You only enable your own abusers doing such things - because a ""friend"" isn't a ""boyfriend"" - and this means (to them) that ""you're not really gay"". Don't entertain it. 

&gt; What do I respond? Do I apologise for my decision to cut contact? Do I pretend that what they've done didn't even matter? How do I just move on?

I can answer these questions from personal experience. 

&gt; What do I respond? 

Don't respond. It's not worth it as you aren't going to get anywhere. You'll be going around in circles. 

&gt; Do I apologise for my decision to cut contact?

No, you don't. I'm pretty staggered you'd even think such a thing. You don't have any apologising to do - at all - for anything. THEY DO. Do you have Stockholm Syndrome or something? (I'm being serious - that isn't normal).

&gt; Do I pretend that what they've done didn't even matter? 

No, you don't. It does matter. You don't ever forget it, or let anyone else forget it. 

&gt; How do I just move on?

It's difficult, but you just have to live life with your boyfriend. It hurts, but you move on, and you end up far happier not having poison in your life. 

You can't feel guilt because you are not the guilty one. You didn't choose this, or want this - they chose this. 

I know what I'm talking about from experience. I was sent to an abusive anti-gay ""troubled teen"" program just for coming out as gay at the age of 15. I was ripped out of bed by hired thugs to take me there in the dead of night (that's all legal in the U.S). I was beaten, abused, and subjected to things people wouldn't believe possible. 

Do I forgive? No.
Do I pretend it doesn't matter? No.
Do I apologise for anything? No. 
Do I have contact? No. 
Have I moved on with a wonderful husband in a new country? Yes. 
Is my life better for having toxic people out of my life? Yes. 

The bottom line is, your parents, like my mother at the time, didn't want a gay son. Now, they don't have one. It's really simple.

I'm not going to say it doesn't hurt, but you have to move on to better and brighter things and not look back. "
154,"Get premarital counselling.  I say this because your story reminds me of my parents.  My mom hates clutter and my dad is always keeping stuff around.  I can't tell you how often they've bickered and argued over this very thing through the years.  Do you really want that?

You need to ask yourself if you are capable of changing for your boyfriend (ie. learn to keep fewer possessions and be more proactive in getting rid of things).  If not, then get ready for a lifetime of bickering, arguments, and passive-aggressiveness if you do decide to marry.  Good luck."
155,"No, it would be ""asked my straight friend"""
156,Dude...
157,"Great news. First gay marriage, now this. I never thought social change would happen in Ireland so quickly."
158,"This one is nature and it's amazing. There have been multiple eye tracking studies where men always look at crotches first. In one they showed people photos of baseball players. Men's eyes would always go to the crotch for a split second first. The women would look at eyes first. In another study, they increased the range of photos and men even looked at animal crotches first when the animals were male.

It seems like it's hard-wired and universal to men regardless of orientation."

163,"While this is cute, I have one caveat: in the future, try not to trash talk your ex in front of people you may be interested in. It just doesn't look good to say ""my ex is a total prick, but you're cute, let's go out sometime!"" What's to say they won't be the next ""prick"" getting trash talked?

Just my point of view, anyway."
164,Don't cheat on your girlfriend.
165,You ever hang out with 2 straight dudes who are close friends? Like that but we fuck each other in the ass.

169,What's funny is that his voice is probably a large part of that and his voice actor isn't nearly as attractive.
170,"I believe that people are born with their sexual orientation and that this is a matter of genes, but then, it's based only on my experiences.

No one ever gave me a choice (why would I even want to complicate my life and pick being gay, lol?) and nothing happened in my life that could influence my sexuality. I knew I was attracted to men since very young age also."
171,"You are not alone.  Surveys based on self-reporting generally show a large minority of men do it, which probably means that at least half of the men saying they don't do it are lying (or unemployed). "
172,Yes. I didn't like it very much because the sacrifices kept screaming like crazy and the goats escaped the enclosure.

175,"I think I might be 0.01% heterosexual.

176,"Why do you keep apologizing? They're pricks and instead of actually telling them they need to apologize for their abuse you just apologize for not accepting their abuse. It's ridiculous.

180,It's very easy to make the risk of HIV infinitesimally small.
181,"For me, being loved by another man makes me feel complete. 

Complete because the sincere love of another man allows me to express all aspects of myself without restriction. I can allow myself to simply be because I know he accepts me as I come. Nothing is a flaw when we both understood the backstory.

I still remember the first guy I've been with. The way he looked at me made me feel like a developing Polaroid. All of me was rising to the surface, all emotions, all my thoughts. I hid nothing from him, and that was what he wanted. 

He wanted to understood me, wanted to help me become a whole person. 

He said the first time he saw me he knew how lonely I was. Just the way I walked and how heavy my eyes were, he said.

 He wanted me to have someone to talk to, wanted me to have someone who can make me feel safe at night, wanted me to feel worthy. 

The first time he hugged me I felt like all the broken parts of me came together. He healed me, even if it was temporary. 

Before I met him, I never understood how easy it is to just exist. Before, there was always something wrong when I look into the mirror. Before, I always thought that I couldn't be loved.  

Now not anymore. 

We went separate ways, but I know that wherever he is, he still loves me and I love him too. 
"
182,"&gt; Do I real talk my friend and be like ""yo I know your boyfriend is nice enough to pay for pretty much all your shit but he's kind of a shitbag, and I'll hang out with you but I refuse to hang out with your boyfriend?"" 

Yes. "
183,"I'll be 70 in a few months and I think my unwillingness to accept my age's limitations are causing problems.  Specifically, my body will not tolerate running, hiking, weights and other physical activity as it has in previous decades.  My body doesn't just say ""I'm tired, now""; it punishes me with persistent pain.  I'm at the point that I need to quit trying to do five sets of 25 pushups, more of an hour of hills on my mountain bike or drink ten beers and get up in the morning feeling OK.  I should note that my knees have worn out after 40+ years of running.

So, yes, I need to make some adjustments."

196,"My related tip would be to listen to your gut, especially early. Often the wrong kind of guy will give off a bad vibe. It can be easy to ignore or overlook warning signals though because you're horny or believe a guy is offering something other guys aren't or whatever. There's a good chance it's not worth ignoring bad signals and usually it's not like you'd need to do so either."

While he kinda has a point, open relationships need to have rules and those rules need to be the foundation of said relationship. I don't think if he's just gonna get laid and never contact the dude again, he doesn't really owe them his life story. If he has a regular fuck buddy ***maybe***... It's something you should really discuss with him and pretty much like I said have rules set in place. "

You haven't even gone on a real date with this guy yet. Meeting the kids is a hypothetical in the distant future. Most (responsible) divorcees with kids wait quite a while before introducing the new partner to their kids, because they don't want the kids to get attached to someone who might not stick around.

Just enjoy your date and see where things go from there. "
202,"No No No No No No No.

No."

Instead, he chose to sneak around behind my back and then had the audacity to lie to my face and try to convince me that it didn't happen. If he wanted an open relationship, he should have told me. He chose to lie, be manipulative and try to make me look crazy. I'm not okay with that. 

I'm going to take my time and think all of this through, but this is a lot to take in all at once. "
209,"Same thing happened to me yesterday. Although it's pretty clear that my sister is gay, she just told me yesterday just to make it clear (we never talked about it before). I haven't came out to any of family members before, but at that moment I was like okay fuck it and I told her too. She was quite shocked. Oh well."

I told him to hold on and went to get my sister from another aisle, since I wasn't from that town and she was. As soon as he saw my sister he started backing away like a cornered animal seeking escape. He accepted her suggestion with a mumbled ""Thanks,"" and fled. I realized later he was hitting on me, the first and only time this has ever happened in public that I'm aware of. He had mistaken my sister for my girlfriend."

223,"It feels awesome, the whole let's fall in love thing is so strange and wonderful. But make sure to love yourself and be happy in your own before heading into a relationship because if you make a guy the center of your universe only because you are lonely or feeling down that is not going to end well for either of one"
224,"Cultural appropriation is the biggest bunch of bull shit that ever existed in the first place, whether we're talking about porn or not."

226,"Oh man, what a sick burn! I'm so offended and sad. You really got me there, bro."
227,"It comes from a complex interplay of genetics and environment. You're not born gay, babies don't have a sexuality per se. but you can be born with a high probability that you will be gay, especially when you factor in prenatal hormones. 

But it is not consciously chosen. 

HOWEVER even if it were as clear cut a choice as whether to put on brown or black shoes in the morning, that doesn't mean it's wrong. 

Arguing for tolerance (or for that matter intolerance) based on nature vs choice is intellectually lazy. There are many unchosen tendencies (for example, sociopathy and pedophilia) that we nevertheless don't want to tolerate. Whether it is a choice or not has no impact on morality"
228,Of the few straight highschool crushes I had one turned out to be gay. I found out after I took his virginity and stuff. 
229,"My husband has no idea how much I love bondage, toys, role play and perverted stuff like sounding, electro stim play and more. My husband is super vanilla and even a dildo skeeves him out. 

He does know about my extensive leather collection.... he discovered that when we were moving in together 5 years after we met. He will not let me take any of it out of the closet. I still go into that closet just to smell the intoxicating leather aroma that is mixed with all those years of sweat lust and shame. "
230,The base of their dick
231,"The small penis story hit so close to home. I think gay men are even crueler than women about it based off my conversations with my female friends about their partners. I have grown content and happy with where I'm at in life, but I'm also still a virgin at 23. I don't really expect that I'll have sex any time soon...only this time I'm just not putting myself out there at the moment. Before, when I was putting myself out there, I have been constantly rejected and have even been laughed at to my face by a guy who saw my dick. So mostly I just focus on my career and just spend a lot of time alone. Swimming, clubbing, etc. are all affected by my feelings about my penis size. And although I realize that I have self-esteem issues to work on, a lot of it has been fueled by porn, gay culture, media, actual things said/done to me by gay men in person and on apps.

237,"I've had guys that I didn't initially find attractive become attractive after I got to know them, but that works both ways, the hottest guy with a shit attitude will progressively look uglier to me."
238,"I'm single and have been for 5+ years.  Before that I was in a 17 year relationship, before that a 9 year one and before that a 7 year one.  So apparently I am getting better at it or more tolerant. 

I don't think of being single as an impediment, quite the contrary. I like to leave Texas for all of August and 1/2 of September.  I like to stay up late or go to be early.  I like sleeping alone.  

While having another partner is possible it isn't likely.  I'm set financially, have a lovely home, the freedom to travel and the $ which is equally important.  I have an active sex life, plenty for someone my age.  Having someone to eat with more often would be a nice change but I enjoy my life.  

Ending up this way, as you put it, was a choice.  My partner was cheating and lying about it.  Who needs that in their life?"
239,We're buying a house together later this week and will likely get engaged soon.
240,Haha did you get a third date after that?
