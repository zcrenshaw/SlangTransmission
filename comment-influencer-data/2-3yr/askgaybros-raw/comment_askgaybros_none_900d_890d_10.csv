1,We converted another
2,"Before we do this, a few points:

* Gay people are an invisible, persecuted minority who mostly grow up without the support of understanding family. 

* Gay bars are one of very few places where gay people can go to be in a room full of other gay people. (We pay money for this privilege.)

* Hitting on strangers of unknown sexual orientation in public can be dangerous.

* The gay bar is the one place where you can reasonably assume that the handsome stranger at the end of the bar is gay and hit on him without fear of being beaten up by a violent homophobe.

* When gay bars are overrun by straight people and gay patrons must use their gaydar to figure out whether that handsome stranger is gay or not, they cease to be useful to gay men.

* ""Straight bars,"" to the extent that they even exist, do not play an analogous role in straight people's dating and social lives.

* Not all gay bars are created equal. There is a meaningful difference between a mixed-crowd dance club and a dark, sleazy pickup joint."
3,"This is really weird.  I think if I was in a relationship for 2.5 years and that happened, I'd be tempted to go to his place to see what's up.  "
4,But her emails 
5,"No, it really doesn't even touch on it in most places and curriculums. This, in my mind, is one of the leading reasons to higher than average rates of STDs in the gay community. If you look specifically at the various sub groups, black men have even higher rates of STD infection. This is because there is a lack of proper sex education in all areas, but most especially in poorer or underserved neighborhoods (think inner-city Chicago) where the black population is higher. Education is the key to developing thriving societies and a lack of it is the best weapon to ensure one doesn't develop."
6,I think that in this case you would not be crazy for showing up in his place. Disappearing after a relationship of 2.5 years is not normal. 
7,Congra--! Oh.
8,My turn: I fucked a straight boy last night
9,"Anyone who voted for Trump knew that he would do things like this.

Business interests &gt; safety, well being, and privacy of the country's citizens.

This has been the pattern of every Trump policy.

Let's bring back coal mining even though the industry is still going to die. But who cares about facts, environmental protections are to blame.

FCC regulations preventing ISPs from selling your data.  Nonono we can't have that, that's government over reach and hurts businesses. They should be allowed to sell your personal data.

Won't be surprised if cigarette cartons will have heir warnings removed under Trump because it hurts the tobacco industry and cancer warnings are ""fake news"" without any scientific merit."
10,I'd just wait for him to come out to you if he does and remain open to things 
11,"My sociology teacher used to say ""we can go on the streets with the questionnaires and start asking people how many children have they abused, or we can save our time from wasting and assume that respondents are humans and they will be honest as long as they are ready to admit to something"".

No, I don't suggest that gay people abuse children, but most of them is actually not ready to admit that they are homosexual. That's why this statistic won't be honest for a long time."
12,"Sounds like a good thing.  I barely precum at all, and wish I could leak more. #grassisalwaysgreener"
13,"Congrats! A uniquely memorable proposal is so much better than a generic proposal. All of us here, except the bitter cynics, will be happy for you. 

Hope mine goes that sort of way when the day comes 😄"
14,"Hmm...that would be my straight crush I had for years while I was denying my sexuality. I would work out with him at the gym, pretended that I cared about his favorite football and baseball teams, and have working lunch with him. I even met his girlfriend and we had a dinner party together. Towards the end, I was spiraling into depression; I just had very unsatisfying sex with a woman; I was questioning everything.  He recently got engaged to his long-time girlfriend (now wife) and stopped working out with me. We still got lunch at work together.

So on this particular day, with my emotions a compartmentalized cauldron boiling over, (I was so out of touch with my emotions I thought: ""Everything is ok. I'm fine."" I was acclimated to the feeling sad most of the time.) I went to lunch with him, like normal. We each got our usual meals from the food court. And then, like a phantom other person took control, I reached out and held his hand for a brief instant. 

He instantly reacted. His eyes went wide. His jaw dropped. I quickly recoiled. But he still held the wordless ""What the *fuck* dude?"" expression on his face for one second, two seconds as this memory burned into my brain, and then he had a mask drop down over his face. Publicly, he pretends that it never happened, even acting surprised when I came out a couple of months later. But the friendship is dead.

And that, young gay children, is why you never mess with straight boys."
15,Buttery males 😙
16,Love how the post is marked NSFW but all the NSFW content is in the title.

18,Well that took a turn. 
19,This is my shocked face.
20,"[LYRICS](http://imgur.com/a/hHliQ) for anyone interested. 

"
21,"I hate straight girls in the gay bar more than straight guys. Drives me nuts when they come waltzing in thinking we (many of us anyway) actually enjoy their presence there. And I am not talking like the straight girl that comes with her gay friend (they are cool), I am talking the hoard of straight girls (sometimes in bachelorette party attire and sometimes with their BF's - leading to the straight guy problem) who think they are hot shit and so cool for hanging with the gay dudes. Fuck. Them. "
22,Just because you're a guy doesn't mean we're automatically attracted to you. We still have standards.
23,"THICK LEGS ARE THE WORLD!!!!!!!! Especially in shorts. Dem muscles  

College is torture "
24,But guys he held the flag I don't understand
25,"Im pretty strong from lifting, so when fucking a small guy I love to manhandle him and lift him up in the air during the act. Making out when I lower him up and down on my cock is heaven. Rimming during a standing 69 when he sucks my cock is fun too.
"
26,"I have huge muscular legs from squatting but nobody seems to care 😞

Edit: My legs while I was trying on a pair of shorts that showed them off. I didn't buy them though, I don't think I could wear those in public... http://imgur.com/a/ObC1X"
27,Double ended dildo.
28,"If his ex's feelings and needs are a priority over yours, then who is he really in a relationship with?"
29,"Yup.  27 here too. I feel like I was robbed of a lot of experiences that other people got to have, whether they were straight or came out early.  

Never dated.  Probably going to scare potential boyfriends away when I tell them I'm a new dater with zero boyfriend history.  *shrug*"
30,...wow
31,God this brings back some hot memories. Quite a few years ago I was seeing a guy that produced loads of pre cum a few time he managed to fuck me using just that as lube. 
32,"It wasn't a gay bar, but I was at a happy hour at a regular bar with the lgbt organization from work- like a social event, nothing special. 

I was with just people from this group, and it was my first one so I didn't know anybody. My gaydar ended up pinging on this one guy I was having a conversation with... Long story short I decided the following week to get in touch through email and give a generic ""it was nice meeting you..."" and ask him for coffee sometime. 

Turns out he's straight, even has a gf, he's just supportive.

It couldn't be more analogous to my luck than going to an LGBT event and hitting on the *only straight guy* there. "
33,After 2.5 years you deserve a chat about why things ended. Someone needs to call this guy out on his crap and tell him that you can't do this to someone. I would actually either show up at his place or at the very least write a letter and send it to him.
34,"One time I had a dick in my mouth and I said ""phfsbsh shbpshs"". "
35,Don't ever say that to anybody
36,"Seriously just tell him you need some time to recover. You don't have to fuck every single day, what happened to just regular old sucking cock like the good Lord intended."
37,A mattress that is on a frame of some sort and a tidy bed. 
38,You'll get your toaster in the mail soon.
39,Getting catfished when I was like 12 on AIM and sending someone money for a plane ticket. I was banned from the internet for a while after that. 
40,"I thought we were sending panini presses, or did they cut the budget?"
41,"Definitely.

I avoided parties and drinking all through high school and my first year of college because I was scared of getting drunk and coming out to people I didn't want to come out to. In retrospect, it was no big deal to come out, but I didn't want to do it until I knew for sure. Which ended up taking a long time. "
42,"You are 100% within your rights to do this.  Hell, my longest-term relationship was with a poz guy, and I avoid HIV-positive guys on the apps.  

But keep in mind that there are plenty of guys out there who just don't disclose.  Back in the day the advice was to assume that *everyone* you sleep with is HIV-positive, and that's really what you need to do."
43,I pretended I agreed with his conservative political opinions...
44,"I would say... first gestures of affection and intimacy.

I remember well one summer evening. We were going back from a football match he really wanted to see and he stopped the car in a viewpoint. We were alone there, it was a sunset and the whole city was bathed in light. The only thing ruining the mood was the wind - horrible, strong wind.

It made me shiver from cold, since I was in very summery outfit. He noticed it and it was the first time when he decided to touch me in a more intimate way then just hugs or kisses. He pressed his body against my back, he wrapped himself around me and he was tall enough to rest his chin on the top of my head. He covered me almost from every side and his broad shoulders protected me from the wind and cold.

It made me feel really safe and loved and it helped me understand why humans crave for relationships so often - they are really worth it."
45,"Straight guy aesthetic is hot. But as you wish. You may increase your flammability by equipping any combination or all of the following items:

* Scarves
* Skinny jeans
* V-Necks
* tight fashion tank tops (NO SPORT TANK TOPS)
* capris
* skinny shorts
* gay pride wristbands
* necklaces

Additional flammability can be achieved by performing the following on your body

* getting your right ear peirced
* getting your septum peirced
* getting a bar in your ear(s)
* getting a lip peircing
* gay pride tattoo on a visible area of your body
* growing your hair out very long and then shaving the sides.
* dye all/part of your hair an obnoxious color like neon pink purple, or blue. 
* wear light makeup, like eyeliner
* paint your nails
* shave your body completely hairless

The flammable set bonus can only be achieved by those who are truly dedicated to being a flame master, and is awarded to those who 

* dress in drag

The following will reduce your flammability if equipped. Avoid.

* sweatpants. The baggier, the more flammability is reduced.
* hoodies, particularly ones with camo.
* basketball shorts
* boots
* boxers"
46,This is the gay agenda at its finest
47,"Jesus, your brother sounds like he's in a dark place. He's young and stupid. Don't listen to him. 

It sounds like he's got all this negativity and he just unloaded it all on you.

It's not your job to fix him. Is he getting help? You can suggest therapy to him. You can tell your parents you're worried about him. That's about all you can do.

And you don't have to take his shit.

I should say, I'm sorry that's the reaction you got. He sounds like he's in a really bad place with himself and he's taking it out on you."
48,Fucker.  lol

50,"When I was 15 y/o, I watching football with my brother. I was a little bit drunk, because as a good older brother he forced beer into me. I felt a little bit too comfortable around him and when he screamed ""JESUS, THIS FUCKING RETARD CAN'T EVEN ~~HIT~~ KICK THE BALL"" I randomly said ""his calves, tho""... (･ิ_･ิ)"
51,"Yes, you are weird. You are illegal and it's time to go to jail.

54,Jacked a guy off on the roof of a 10 story building and he blew his wad to fall on the street.
55,"That shit is just unsettling. I'd probably confront him, but to be honest I wouldn't feel comfortable with him going forward. The incest driven fantasy aside, recording him w/out his permission. Your BF's behaviour/perception of boundaries sound a little off.  

A logical concern: where are his videos of you?"
56,Gay Trump supporters - like most conservative gays - vote because they bought into the myth that they too can be part of the land-owning white male elite. 
57,It's not crazy after 2.5 years.... 
58,"You're the most predictable troll ever.

Please go back to 4chan or theredpill or wherever you came from."
59,Did he stop his medication recently? He could have a relapse of depression or mania. People who suffered from bipolar can do things very drastically and can be extreme when it is not under control. 
60,no. i have respect for myself.
61,Maybe you're not that straight after all *gasps*
62,"I'm sorry if it's not popular to say this, but if the story is exactly as you have described, then I would say that your BF is either re-living some kind of bad past experience or that he is being way too sensitive. 
 
The key point here is that your BF consented and even encouraged sex at the time, and that you guys are in a LTR. I'm sorry that I don't think the fact that he was under the influence applies the same in this situation as it would a date or hookup. Unless rules were staked out prior this event, then it's not your fault that you got turned on and had sex when your long-term partner got frisky with you and was clearly enjoying the experience. 

Personally, I've had sex with my partner while one or both of us was partially conscious or under the influence many times, and if anyone were to ask us if we've ever felt ""violated"", laughter would ensue.

I think if you can't trust each other at this point, especially on his end, then there's something wrong. That's not to say you shouldn't listen and be supportive of him. Definitely communicate and find out where the boundaries are for any future situations like this. To each their own, and your BF does have the right to say he doesn't want to have sex while under the influence in the future. Tread carefully.






"
63,"These killings are taking place in Muslim-majority Chechnya, so the motivator is not Christian homophobia. Yet before people start going on anti-Muslim rants, let me clarify the situation in Chechnya. It's rather complicated.

Chechens are Sunni Muslims, but traditionally follow Sufism. Chechnya is ruled by a Sufi Muslim strongman hand-picked by Putin, Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov has continued the Russian government's absolutely brutal war against Chechen separatists, who, these days, are Islamists allied with ISIS. He is no Islamist. Yet he has also implemented a form of sharia in Chechnya, with Putin's blessing, to placate the socially conservative values of Chechnya's Muslim populace in order to undercut support for Islamists.

Note, however, that homophobia stems from sources much deeper than religion in Russia. While today in Russia, the most vocal purveyor of homophobia is the Russian Orthodox Church, even during the Soviet era, when both Christianity and Islam were suppressed by the government, most Russians held deeply homophobic views: [As late as 1989, a survey revealed that homosexuals were the most hated group in Russia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_communism#Soviet_Union) While the Soviet government initially decriminalized homosexuality, by the 1930s it had recriminalized it and imposed harsh sentences. Russia is also known for the strong emphasis placed on machismo, which of course breeds homophobia.

So both secular and Muslim homophobia are in play here. Also note that the Chechnyan government is just taking the initiative to do what some Russians in the rest if the country have already been doing on an informal basis. Gangs will commonly entrap gay men via social media and hookup apps and torture or kill them for sport, often recording it on video."
64,I missed much more because of anxiety disorder.
65,"Just going to address your last point.  Yes people can and should vote for a candidate on multiple policies that they agree with not just be a single issue voter.

But at the same time, when you actively vote for a candidate that will strip your own rights as a person. I can't respect that decision."
66,That's pretty normal. 
67,"I don't really trust these statistics, especially since I have recently been in positions where I wouldn't openly identify as gay. Not to mention in some places that percent is much higher, LGBT identification is around 7% in Germany and in the US around the same percent identify as LGBT as well for millennials.

Edit: to answer your actual question, most people that don't like the statistic actually don't like what it's usually used for, which is to say that gay people are so insignificant in terms of the population that they're not worth it or that there's too many gay characters in TV shows and movies and we should have less in them."
68,"&gt;dates hooker

&gt;guys why won't the hooker I'm dating stop hookin"
69,"...what the actual fuck. So, if we rub our butts together somehow that's gonna eventually cause an orgasm?"
70,"&gt; Like, it never even occurs to them that just because I'm gay, doesn't mean I can't also be racist.

I'm fucking dead. "
71,"Straight girls are just annoying af at gay bars. 

I went with my two roommates once, one straight and the other gay. The straight guy decided to pick up a girl at the bar because my roommate and I are getting some action, so why not him? We decide to go on the dance floor and he's talking to a girl and she thinks he's gay because he's a dude and clearly can't be there otherwise. She finds out he's straight and starts saying he can't be there and he shouldn't be there, when he's telling he's there with me and our other roommate just to have fun. Well, she's not having it and continued to shame him and he's like well why are you here? She has the same response as to hate a fun night with her gbf. At that point he just yells at her that she's being a dumb hypocritical cunt. 

Anyways, if you're gonna be in our bar be very low key about it, and don't be offended by things. And don't act like we're zoo animals to be observed. "
72,"That's inaccurate.  I was assured again and again in this sub before the election that Trump was the most pro-gay Republican ever, that he waved a gay flag at a rally, that he had a gay man speak at the GOP convention (Peter Thiel), and that he had always said nice things about gays.  No pro-Trump gay bro said he would encourage employment discrimination."
73,ONE OF US! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
74,He sounds exhausting.
75,Hitting the gym won't magically solve all your dating problems.

77,"Gay Trump supporters voted for him for reasons outside of the gay realm 

Even the gay Trump supporters saw this coming. They still support him for other reasons though from what I've seen "
78,So many unforced errors coming out of this administration with no worthwhile purpose. It's almost like hiring people with zero political experience is a bad thing. Who would've thought?
79,I like to see the faces more than anything else. 
80,I kind of want all of us to agree to always tell straight people that this is how we do it.
81,"You can't change them.  They need to change.  That won't happen until they start to see your boyfriend as a person, and not as simply a black.   My recommendation is that you honor their request not to meet your boyfriend.  The cost of that request is that they don't see YOU either.   I also recommend that you continue to send cards, and include photos of the two of you together.  Once they finally ""get it"" and realize that they can't have you without having HIM, they may rethink.  If they don't, it is much more their loss than yours (although you will hurt like hell over it)."
82,"And if it hurts to try it, go slower with more lube! "
83,"God there is such hatred in this post, man. Holy shit."
84,"Had a crush on a straight guy, so I dumped a gay one because I didn't think it was right to lead him on while my thoughts were somewhere else, and I told him as much. Thought it was the right thing to do, but it turned out it wasn't. Wished I had never done it. Hurt the guy I was dating pretty bad. We hooked up a lot after that, much later on, and he eventually told me he still thinks of that. "
85,"Do it homo, then tell us about it. "
86,"My sex Ed in school was ""don't have sex or you'll die"""
87,"Step one. Self acceptance, you're making progress."
88,Agreed and I would make it known to him thats your supportive of gay people in case he is. Just so he feels like you would be accepting. Like maybe make a comment about a gay couple on TV. You sound like a great parent!
89,"Straight guy was giving me signals to the fucking moon. Examples: *jokingly* asking me to blow him, phone conversations 4-5 times a week that lasted over an hour, would throw me on top of his bed and get on top of me.

This is all culminated in us watching a movie to which point I just grabbed his thigh. Friendship ended right then and there. There was a moment of silence for about 10 minutes, and I left. We never talked about it or to each other ever again. it's been about 7 years since that happened and I still cringe."
90,That's one thrifty paedophile you almost met...
91,"Seek therapy. It can be really, really helpful."
92,I wasn't talking specifically about you. I was speaking in general. Now I feel bad.
93,Walk with your head up high and straight forward. Make the world your runway. 
94,Hehe.  Glad you enjoyed the tour; cum again!
95,"Uh... Not to be alarmist, but are you sure he's okay? "
96,"Take turns as the top. Or, alternatively, try the more fun option and find a top to fuck you both."
97,You nailed this. Totally sounded like someone having an episode or getting overwhelmed and not being able to cope.
98,"Back when I was in high school a girl asked me if I was gay, my response was: ""no way! I think Idina Menzel is so hot!"""
99,"It's all fun and games until someone die. Seriously, I love an occasional ass slapping and wrestling, etc. but choking dudes just turn me off. You're not alone OP."

101,"Yeah I love showering with guys.   I have one FWB who I often shower with in the lead-up to sex... I wash his hair, body, genitals, legs and feet while he feels me up and we get close to each-other......... always gets us both in the mood for some amazing sex.

For actually having sex in the shower, I even bought a pair of suction handles, but this is another story.... "

We have weekly meetings on how to destroy the sanctuary of marriage and a related point system to trade from our Cuisinart catalog.


Well, to find others is like any other group out there -- social gatherings such as bars and meetups, online, and through friends.  Much easier if you live near a city.  One thing to note is just because you are gay doesn't mean every aspect of your life has to be gay-identified.  I think that is a common mistake among newly self discovered homos.  There are other labels you belong to and being gay should be a compliment to what makes you...you.  "

I never got a date out of it!  He played me.

Go to Hell Ryan!!!"
108,"This is actually a very real phenomenon. Arousal overrides disgust. It's what allows us to stick our tongue up someone's ass or lick their cum in the first place. 

My advice would be to wait until you find someone you love, someone you trust. Experiment with that person, not with a random hookup like I did."

111,"Completely unnecessary in 99.9% of cases and utterly disgusting as a result. Arguments of hygiene don't stand up, because washing your dick isn't fucking rocket science.

I'm obviously against it regardless of the gender of the victim, but the doublethink going on between male vs female from some people is amazing. People will condemn female genital mutilation one moment and turn around and use the exact same arguments they just criticised to justify circumcision."

113,"Life protip: if there's something you haven't tried and it doesn't hurt to try it, then try it."
114,"As someone in an open relationship in which both of us have watched the other get fucked, I will say this: do not do this if you simply are not comfortable with the idea. The poly lifestyle is simply not for everyone.

That said, if you're curious, and it's something you could picture yourself enjoying, then I recommend you start small and work your way from there. For example, for your first encounter with another guy, there would be no fucking. Perhaps just making out with someone in front of your partner. Then afterwards have a discussion with him about how that made him feel, how it made you feel, if you're willing to try more, and anything else you think is relevant.

#COMMUNICATION IS PARAMOUNT TO MAKING SURE YOUR RELATIONSHIP SURVIVES EXPERIMENTING WITH OTHER MEN. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.

Anyway, if you both enjoyed that, work your way up from there. Invite a guy over to blow him. Have a threeway. Something like that. You get the idea.

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions, OP. I'm well-versed in the poly lifestyle and have been in a successful open relationship for well over a year now."
115,"Yes! I was 31, he was 33. Both of us had stop trying to find ""the one""... yet we ended up finding each other.  
We've been together 19 years this January. He is my best friend and my true love, and I am his. It's amazing that you can love someone so much, yet still find new ways to fall even deeper in love each day. 
If I were to offer any advice or observation, it would be this. Don't set a goal to find ""the one"". Instead, just make an effort to meet new people and be open to possibilities, even if your first impression doesn't scream ""omg he's perfect!"""
116,"Gurl... life is too short to be worrying about what people are gonna say. If you wanna scream YAS MAWMAW,  YASS GAWD, YAAAAASSSSSS GAGA, BOOTS THE HOUSE DOWN, OKURRRRRR..... \*tonguepop* go for it. It's stressfull to have to pretend you're someone else.

119,"This is called paruresis 


The trick is to get into the idea of WANTING to pee in front of people. This can be done with a form of  ""graduated exposure therapy""


One technique is to go into the stall and try to be as loud as possible when people are around. Pee into the water and make sure everyone can hear you. Keep doing this and eventually you will train your mind to not associate peeing with fear of people. That's because you're training yourself to be confortable peeing around others"

125,"He seems like he's a handful to deal with. I mean, I'm glad you guys worked it out but he seems really... sensitive about *everything*. 

&gt;This might sound ridiculous but if he weren't my boyfriend I don't know if I would ever sleep with him again only because this whole thing really made me feel that sad and guilty and predatory.

That's the thing, he's making you feel all guilty and weird and I honestly think he's doing the most. Waking up drunk can be disorienting but I don't know if his reaction is proportional to the circumstances.

137,"Forgot to add something - we also discussed the dinner convo about marriage that started this whole thing.  

So he was genuinely oblivious before that that I was planning to propose. I asked him why he was so adamant about not getting married and he says he really wasn't, he was just venting about it in general but that it occurred to him that I might have been asking because I wanted to get married at some point. So he said that when I said (lied) that I didn't want to either he felt better because he thought he had hurt my feelings. Anyway, hopefully that fills in some gaps for people who wanted to know.  "
138,"I'm sort of the opposite.

I like a guy that's strong but I have to be stronger. There's something really sexy about a guy that is actually pretty strong and a little cocky about it and *thinks* he can take me down, but ultimately has to submit to me. And then get fucked by me because he lost. And then he squirms in pleasure as I pound away while his eyes roll back into his head...

151,"The first time I went to a gay bar I was really nervous so I brought my straight friends, both straight guys. They both got hit on before they ever entered the club. They were both super nice about it but it continued more and more as the night went on. 

What I did not appreciate was how over the top some of these guys got, such as trying to convince them that they weren't actually straight if they were at a gay bar or offering to pay them to go out back and give them a blow job; some guys just could not take no for an answer. They were really good sports about the whole thing though and I really commend them for going with me at all."

He then asked me if I wanted to try it with him and get it out of my system. I was a bit hesitant since we're friends and I didn't want to make it weird between us. But he reassured me that if I liked it or if I didn't it would be cool between us no matter what. About half an hour later we were doing the deed.
155,"I'll give her the not wanting attention, but the attitude she gave my roommate for being there and straight was appalling. Like she flat out said he shouldn't be there at all, when she was straight and there at the same time. "

160,"At least now you know that he really does love you. Because even after telling you that he's not crazy about the concept of marriage and seeing you at your worst, he still wants to marry you. I think everyone should propose this way. Don't make it all beautiful and romantic, because that's not how your entire life together is going to always be. Relationships are hard and take work. So get hammered, give them the ring in some overly dramatic and slightly passive aggressive way, throw up on them, and if they still say yes after all that, you know you'll be together forever."
161,"Lol, the responses would be sooo different if this was posted on r/gayincest"
162,I didn't ask. I guess I could. I moreso wanted him to be excited about marriage because he loved me rather than because of practical benefits like that
163,your difficulty finding a date is the least interesting aspect of this number.
164,Look at your life. Is being a D tier troll on the internet what you want to be doing with it?
165,"Yeah, neither of us consciously noticed until that moment. He's a good man, but he was a little oblivious. I once asked a probing question about when he was getting engaged soon; previously, he had mentioned in a throwaway comment that he would pop the question to her after his baseball team won the World Series. After that team won the Series, I asked if he was getting engaged soon while we were working out at the gym. He had a pained, slightly irritated expression on his face and he dodged the question.

I know what I was doing now. There was a small part of me, buried deep in the subconscious, that was hoping that it wasn't going to work out between them, that I could have the stable, long-term relationship they had.

In the meantime, I was busy preparing ""to make it work"" with ""the right girl, once she came along."" I was so deep in denial that I probably was able to convince other people that I was straight too. But I still craved for male intimacy, and that distorted the male friendships that I had. And I'd say I fooled probably only 80-90% of people, at the most.

And don't feel sad; if I hadn't done that supremely stupid thing, I might have remained stuck in my self-deluded closet. In the short term, yeah, I felt like shit and sunk deeper into depression. But I finally crawled my way to a therapist, marked ""bisexual"" on the intake questionare for the first time and began the path to healing my self-inflicted wounds."

171,"Any movement to remove a condition from a mental disorder list will be political.  

1.  Labeling homosexuality as a mental disorder doesn't account for other sexualities.  Do bi/pan people have a mental disorder?  What about asexual people? 

2.  We've learned that regardless of your sexuality, you can be a fully engrained functioning member of society; socially, mentally, physically, and professionally.  There are no mental inhibitions.    

3.  Sexuality has been found to be as varied and as meaningless to your mental capacity as your eye color or type of ear lobe.  People are straight, gay, bi just like how people have green, blue, and brown eyes.

4.  Our society is currently evolving to not be dependent on Christianity or religion like it has in the past.  The reason homosexuality was ever a mental disorder in the first place is because when western society was established, society's leaders were also religious leaders and considered borderline holy.  Western society was ruled for centuries by the Catholic Church.  Even monarchies in different nations were subject to the Church to an extent.  While not as impactful as centuries ago, in recent centuries, the laws of nations are still derived from religious texts and doctrine.  ""America was founded on Christian values.""  This says it right here.  Science and secular politics having control over law is still relatively new.  Science and secular politics have zero case to consider homosexuality a mental disorder.  The entire mindset that it was ever a disorder in the first place comes from religion.

5.  Your sexuality does not determine your physical ability to reproduce, which many say is essential to life.  Whether you're gay or not does not determine your ability to reproduce.  While probably not mentally comfortable or pleasurable, a gay man is still physically able to impregnate, and a gay woman is still physically able to get pregnant.  Other factors contribute to infertility; sexuality is not one of them.    

6.  The needs homosexual people need to be happy and healthy are the same as anyone else.  They don't need any extra treatment, medication, or attention.  They need what all people: Family, friends, support, acceptance, etc.

7. EDIT: There is simply nothing diseased or medically ""abnormal"" about being homosexual.

177,"When I was in high school I had a huge crush on the captain of the wrestling and baseball team (one guy, two sports) for pretty much all four years. Our sophomore year, I'd worked up the courage to actually talk to him and he was a nice guy - clearly not interested, but he at least entertained the possibility that we might be friends. 

Fast forward to middle of the year when he's getting D's in English class. We had a big mid-year paper due that was 40% of the year's grade, and a day before it's due he hasn't even read his book (we all had different book assigned). 

I literally read his book that afternoon (I took speedreading classes as a kid), explained it to him, and talked him through writing the paper. I ended up feeding him the essay sentence by sentence because he just didn't really care enough to try.

A week or so later we got our papers back, and he had an A with a note from the teacher that said, ""This didn't sound like your writing."" I got a note on my paper to see the teacher. He could tell I ""helped"" my crush, and he sat me down after school to tell me that this boy wasn't going to like me just because I did his homework for him. 

I died from embarrassment. Every once in a while I think about that moment and still turn beet red in the face."

180,"I briefly dated a narcissist because he was handsome, incredibly intelligent, and French (sexy accent). It was weird though because he didn't want to kiss me (even though we'd do other things). It's not like he was in the closet, we went out for coffee, dinner, concerts etc.

Turns out that he didn't want to kiss me because he thought that I am 'neurotic' and that if he did I'd 'fall in too much love' and 'become obsessed with' him. He then prompted to tell me that I'm not smart enough for the job I wanted to get after graduating (He was 5 years older in the field/role that I am pursuing). I'm pretty competitive/ambitious so that really pissed me off. He went through a laundry list of my apparent character flaws and treated me like an emotionally weak bitch. All prompted because I was annoyed he wouldn't kiss me. 

After he verbally shit on me for 5-10 minutes, I asked him ""Are you finished now?"". He said ""yes"" and expected me to not do anything, or maybe to cry. I then said, ""Get out of my house, and if you message me again, it better be to apologize"". He predicted that I'd be crawling back to him in no time. 

Truthfully, his words got to me, I was pretty shattered for a couple days/weeks. But I refused to message him again, and refused to give him the satisfaction of being right. Thankfully, I'm stubborn. 

He messaged me a month later asking to go for coffee. I went, but then he refused to apologize. So I just left. He messaged me a couple other times but I just ignored him and then he stopped.

Fast forward a half year. I got a job offers from multiple firms, including his. I chose to go to a better one. The immature part of me wants to tell him to rub it in his face. But I won't lol. 

I guess it's not a great answer to the question, but he was just irrationally cruel to me for no good reason. Don't date a narcissist.

196,"As terrible as it sounds, that's pretty clever lol"
197,"Three months in, assuming you've been seeing each other regularly.

I'm not completely serious. There's no real rule about this and my three-month answer is somewhat arbitrary, but here's why I'm saying that based on personal experience.

Years ago I dated a guy and I was ridiculously infatuated. I was also a mid-twenties guy with very limited dating experience, so I didn't handle myself well. I could make an exhaustive list of my mistakes, but the common thread in all of them was that I was trying way too hard to turn this guy into my boyfriend. This included having ""the talk"" only a few weeks in, which was awkward and clearly was not something he wanted to talk about. I didn't recognize all the mistakes I made at the time, but after an honest postmortem (he did ""let's be friends"" after three months and never talked to me again) I saw how clingy, annoying, and thirsty I was. It was a huge bummer getting dumped by this guy and took a good year to get over it, so I decided to prevent the same situation in the future, I would stop trying so hard, embrace the be-yourself cliche, and let the chips fall.

Not long after, I met another great guy. I didn't stress out about our status, I didn't try to be cooler than I was, I just let myself be with him for whatever length of time I'd be with him. Focused less on the future and where we were headed than on where we were in the moment. Roughly three months in we went to NYC for a concert, and on our way to the venue he asked, ""so are we like, boyfriends now?"" I said yes, and that was it. We're married now.

I'd better get to the point since this is way longer than intended. I say three months because that is a reasonable length of time in which to get to know someone and to know if you fit together at a basic level. But really what you should try to do is get to a point where your relationship status is sort of a foregone conclusion. Like I said, with my husband I didn't make an effort to turn our relationship serious. I let it turn serious on its own. I didn't tell him how much I liked him, I showed him instead. At first it's simple. I asked for a second date, which isn't something you do unless you like the person. He said yes to a second date which told me the same thing. We made each other laugh a lot. We kept inviting each other to hang out, to go places, to do things. We had fun. We shared personal details of our lives. We talked about our life goals and our relationship goals. At no point did I worry about when he would be my boyfriend. I didn't try to force the issue and neither did he. And we didn't need to. If he didn't like me, he wouldn't be asking me to hang out all the time. If it wasn't going well, we wouldn't laugh so much when we were together. By the time he asked the question, the answer was obvious.

No doubt there will be many opinions, but that's my answer. You have the talk when you feel reasonably certain of what the response will be."

I'm not using it as an opportunity to be a perv, just the opposite- I'm so hyperconcious of the possibility that they *think I am* that I feel uncomfortable because besides not doing the thing that they think you might be capable of doing, there's nothing you can do to put their mind to ease. 

And frankly, it's probably all in my head... They probably *don't* think that far into it, and I never have this issue with strangers, it just comes down to people that *know*. 

I dunno... Carryover shame? Apologizing for the possibility that other people still equate gay = deviant? Or just paranoid, who knows... "
201,"No, the law does not remove LGBTQ protections. It simply removes the requirement for these companies to show that they haven't done any of this stuff, I assume, with records with employment pay and whatnot.

204,"Yes.  I didnt really think in terms of ""the one"".  It wasnt like i was trying a key in every lock i saw in order to find a fortune inside.

It was more like trying the key, some times in locks here and there, expecting to find the occasional mini treasure like lost favorite sunglasses or nice pens that had gone missing over the years, being told that behind some few of them were real treasure chests but not really thinking i would happen upon one and being fairly satisfied with just getting my stuff back sometimes.  And then one time i turned the key and behind the door it unlocked stood Bruce, a little skinny fuzzy freckled guy in glasses and khakis, telling me to follow him.

I felt distracted from my business, but he had pulled me inside with his big grin and his warm, soft touch.

By the time i noticed that the door had locked itself again, Bruce had put the key into his back pocket and i didnt really want it anymore.  The room was expansive, fully automatically sunlit or subdued according to mood, furnished beautifully and comfortably with everything i needed.  There wasnt any reason to leave."
