0,You may have brought him a bit of joy to his life at a time when he really needed it.
1,"&gt; I'm going to lose all of my friends.

No, you're going to find out who your *real* friends are. That might mean losing some or all of the people you *currently think of* as your friends, which is hard. But the people who are with you when the dust settles are the ones who are friends with *you* instead of the *image of you* you had been cultivating before.

Good luck, stay strong, and fuck the haters."
2,"You need to calm down. The dad full well knew what he saw, and just wanted to take the dad route and pretend that he didn't see anything since neither of you were in clear or present danger. 

Just go about your business like nothing ever happened. Try and lay off giving your mate blowies while the dad's in the house, that's just bad form. 

"
3,"&gt; He's exactly my type: clean, fem, twink, and a bottom.

So responsible, supportive, adult, self-reliant doesn't describe your type?  

At college age, people still think about their relationships types in terms of sexual compatibility. Now would be a good time to start thinking beyond that. Not only are you good enough to get someone better than that, but he's the one who isn't good enough for you. You may, however, have to learn to settle for someone who isn't a twinkish model type. "
4,"Straight men are like 95% of men. When the pool of people to whom you're potentially attracted is that overwhelmingly heterosexual, you're going to end up being attracted to a straight guy at some point. "
5,I wouldn't even care if Trump came out tomorrow and hosted a gay parade with dancing twinks and penis pinatas. He's not getting my vote. the incompetence is too stronk in that toupeed Oompa Loompa.
6,Don't be sad you're dodging bullets here 
7,"No one can take anything he says about LGBT rights seriously when you look at his VP pick and Supreme Court choices.   It's ludicrous that anyone at this point could even consider this walking buffoon for president. 

Would I normally choose Clinton?  No. But this isn't a normal year. "
8,And thats why he is HIV positive. 
9,"Assert your dominance, annex their house"
10,"If he's a good dad, even if he saw you blowing his son, he's going to take the ""playing video games"" answer.

Just cool it a bit. Don't drop your next-door neighbor/friend over this. Unless the dad's a total dick, you'll be be getting more dick in your future.

Oh, and try to be a little more discreet in the future when you're playing video games.

And I'm so going to laugh the next time someone says that he ""loves playing video games."""
11,Sorry to hear that. I often forget (and try to remind myself) how little I actually know about guys I've gone on dates with. It's a shame he couldn't go on.
12,"So you asked somebody out and faced no negative consequences of any kind other than not getting to go on a date with him, and that has put you off from ever asking anybody out again?"
13,"It sort of like when your cuddling with someone, but your not really doing it just to cuddle, your doing it to be as close as you can to someone. Your wrapped around them as tight as can be and you just wish you could ""morph"" into them while your both locked together like puzzle pieces. 

Thats the best way i can compare it, you not having sex anymore to just get off. Your having sex to feel that same connection, to feel like your both locked into one another and know this is the closest you can get to being ""one person"". At that point sex is no longer just physical, its escalates to an emotional level too. The world around you stops, and your no longer just having sex. Your now making love to that person and your both just enjoying ""that moment of closeness"". Then once your done your just as physically drained as you are mentally. You both just end up laying there not saying a word because theirs really not much else to say. 

Ive only ever felt that feeling with one guy and its the guy im dating now. Ive thought ive been in love with past bfs but nothing has ever come close to what i have felt with my current bf. I feel like when you connect on that level you really know how much you truly love each other. Its not always like that, sometimes sex is just sex, but every so often sex turns into something completely different when your with the love of your life."
14,"&gt; He doesn't even let me masturbate or watch porn in my damn house yet I don't know if he's doing it when I'm gone.

So he's a bully, 
and you love him.
You need to break up with him, kick him out, and see a therapist. "
15,"It is actually quite racist - its sort of like, idk, have you noticed whenever there is interracial gay porn between white men and asian men, the white man is literally ALWAYS the top? 

Does that not count as racist?

Both of these instances are racist, because they're effectively stereotyping races as having roles; to satisfy peoples fetishes; 

Blacks are thugs to make them out to be ""different"" from the cute white guy they're fucking (who's typically seen in pain), and also, I've noticed black guys in porn are typically the ones that live up to the BBC stereotype - its like porn is literally here to reinforce stereotypes?

Similarly, the white guy who ALWAYS fucks the asian guy (and never in reverse), in my opinion, thats racist too, because it suggests that Asian guys are here to serve as white men's fuckboys. Because you and I know very well there are Asian guys out there with big cocks. I mean honestly, go on Pornhub or wherever, and if you see the number of things titled like ""white daddies take turns on Tao's tight hole"", if you think closely its actually really derogatory - as is calling a black dude a thug, which I've also seen."
16,"I would just message him.  ""Hey &lt;brother's name&gt;.  Small world, huh?"""
17,My husband and I sometimes take the mattress off the bed and go make a bed in other rooms to get a change of scenery. We once slept in the study for a month. It was great.

20,"I think they're pretty much perfect. Thin and light leg hair can look a little strange, it ends up looking like fuzz. 

Don't worry about them, you're all good"
21,Sounds like a good way to get pictures of his brother's spread asshole.
22,This is rape being that you didnt consent. 
23,and then make the dad give *you* a blowjob
24,You're gay not an alien just go out with him and have fun. 
25,"Damn, that went off like a bomb inside me. It's OK to not be attracted to yourself; in fact, it's perfectly normal.

Your little repost just might have fixed my body image issues. Let's see if it sticks."
26,"I clicked on this thinking it was a sincere question. Well played, OP, well played.

Honestly, as a slightly older gay (well, 30, so oldish by the standards of this sub) I think it's pretty cool to see more and more young gay guys who are accepted within a circle of mostly straight friends."
27,"straight = masc = good/desirable/superior

It's pretty fucked up but it is what it is and porn would be stupid not to use that marketing advantage

People who say they're straight on apps I'd say mostly do it for the same reason, they know the ""straight"" label will play into guys' desire to get the forbidden fruit. That said I don't hate on people who identify as straight but want to fuck guys (aka probably heteroromantic but bisexual). I'm not victimized in any way by the labels they choose to put on themselves. The only real damage comes from warping others' expectations of what is normal on the apps.

Bi males are ""unacceptable"" because women can ""dip a toe in the lady pond,"" i.e., hook up with a girl, and still be considered straight, because it's culturally acceptable (because it titillates straight men). But men cannot do the same thing with other men because it's not culturally acceptable, which is obviously shown by even ""excessive"" platonic affection being ""gay,"" when it certainly is not. So agains that cultural backdrop, it's ok to be a bi woman, but not a bi man, because to do anything with another guy = 100% gay. Yes, it's dumb. "

29,"How the fuck does that work ? Do they think ""UGh, that guy is acting responsible, that's such a turn off !"".

This is plainly stupid, if someone gives you shit about using a condom, i think you legitimately have the right to tell them to fuck off.

"
30,"It's a reversal of roles is what it is. I think typically women always have to live with a voice at the back of their head saying ""what's his ulterior motive, is he just trying to get me into bed?"". Once they know you're gay that voice goes away and they can be completely comfortable around you. Meanwhile guys, who are comfortable around other guys and have never had to live with that voice, start having these thoughts and they panic.

32,"I think I'd just tell him ""I know what's going on in your relationship. When you need to leave, just say and I'll be there. Anytime."" and leave it at that. If he tries to argue and say that nothing is going on, just repeat to him ""Anytime, I will be there."""

36,"Hoosier here - Pence is a piece of shit.  For those of you not in Indiana and don't know about it, our little Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) last year was a fucking debacle.  Hastily signed into law by Pence and then later ""fixed"" because he didn't think it would cause so much uproar.  Fucking moron."
37,"Well, porn that appeals to stereotypes sells better than pornos that do not.

Whatever the reason, producers make a business decision about what kind of movies they are going to make and what characters to have in them.

The thing that irritates me about black guys in porn is that they prioritize actors having big dicks over them being good looking or in shape. So, the black actors in these race-bait films will be some 30-50 year old guy with dad-bod, but a 10 inch dick. That just perpetuates the stereotype that black men are less attractive overall than white men.

It's a ridiculous stereotype because race has nothing to do with looks, but here we have so many people trying to use that as the justification for why they don't date/fuck black guys."
38,"I've always disliked the desire to quantify intelligence. While intellectual capacities certainly exist, how well you emotionally, socially, or even physically bond with others has very little to do with one's raw intelligence. As a previous poster stated, being able to hold conversation is important, just as it's important to *click* with a potential partner. I'm not wholly suggesting your ego is getting in the way of finding a suitable partner, but such thinking might hinder your happiness. 


Most people can hold intellectual conversations, even if they don't share your 'level of intelligence.' I think what you're looking for is someone who has a passion for learning and a curiosity of life. I wouldn't conflate that with one's academic tenure or ability. "

47,"Chances are, it's not a date.

A dude can go to a bar with another dude without either of them being gay.  Friends do this all the time.

My advice is to be yourself and have a nice night out.  You could casually come out to him by saying that you're gay and miss just hanging out with the guys."

They're not all trying to fuck me. 4)I really hate how girls are allowed to talk about each others butts and it's not gay but with guys everything is ""homoerotic"". "

OK, so, you guys seem to be doing things a bit backwards, but who cares? Your friendship is already altered. There's no way you can forget this happened. You two have to talk about it. What's the alternative--spend the rest of your life wondering?

Honestly, just stop.

He's getting off on the exhibition. It's not about you at all. It doesn't sound like he's interested in fucking a guy, he clearly just enjoys the attention and knowing that it titillates you (I mean, this is kind of the root of all exhibitionism, isn't it). 

I'm really not sure what you want to get out of this aside from seeing his dick, you're not going to date or anything. You even admit that voicing your desire to see more might affect your friendship. Is this really worth it? 

Focus your time and sexual attention on people capable of making that a two-way street; right now, it may seem like it is, but it's not. "
63,"Coaches build up their players. They also discipline them if the players aren't up to the task assigned. 

You might start of with ""You're late, drop and give me 5-10 push ups""(pick a light number that your bud can do) then start off with some stretching, make sure you correct his form with alot of touching.

Get him to go for a jog around the block, actually make him head out and jog. If he balks at the idea, blow a whistle and say it again like it's an order.

When he gets back, let him know he's done well. Slap him on his ass and tell him to hit the showers.

I'm sure you've watched enough locker room coach porn to know what happens next. You could also go the body building route or engage in other sporting activities outside that would seem innocent to the casual observer but erotic for the two of you.

78,"""I can hear your mom next door..."" "
79,"&gt; No, you're going to find out who your *real* friends are. 

This, OP. I came out (somewhat accidentally) to pretty much my whole grade at my school. For context, I live in the deep, deep South, specifically Alabama, and around 95% of the people here are conservative Christians, including my family. At first, things were uncomfortable. I got weird looks, just like you, got called names, got asked uncomfortable questions, and several other things. Some of the people that I called my friends turned out to be unsupportive and shitty. But, something else happened. I was able to find out who my true friends were, the people who would support me when everything went to shit. These people didn't look at me any differently and gave me big hugs when I came out to them. I was able to start talking to them about ""gay stuff"" and they didn't care. Several of them tried to hook me up with their other gay friends, and the other ones helped me out in other ways. I built a network of people who supported me and loved me for who I am, when the rest of the school and even my own family didn't. I feel more comfortable and happy with who I am now than I have ever been before, and the feeling is just so amazing. I've learned over time to fuck the haters and live how I want to live, to be myself no matter how people look at me, and I'm so much better off because of that. 

So yeah, anyway. OP, even though it seems like your life is ending and everything is shitty, trust me when I say that it will get so much better. Those ""friends"" that are talking about you and making fun of you are not your true friends. Fuck them. Find your true friends, and once you do, things will be so, so much better. "

This one point alone would make me break up with someone because only a fucking psycho would tell their partner they're not allowed to jerk off. Even if the dude got a job and started pulling his weight, this is still incredibly controlling behavior. 

Your situation is fucked and I would give this guy the boot tomorrow if I were you. I know you said you're chubby and bearish, and that's exactly what a lot of guys are into. Don't tell yourself you wont find anyone else, because there's someone for everyone. It seems like you have some self-esteem issues that are causing you to let this mooch stick around. "

I found a guy on one of the apps, he was brown and was definitely not ""ethnically swedish"" so to speak. We decided to meet up and I asked where. 

He told me that he wanted to do it in the middle of this immigrant area and I was apprehensive of that for numerous reasons. Asking if we could meet inside this specific garage, since, obviously he didn't want his parents knowing about any of this. I agreed but I found it very strange that he kept rejecting my offers to come over to my place. 

So I went there and stood on a hill not too far away from that garage. Eventually he came. But not alone. He came with what I assume was his friends. I counted 8 of them in total. 

Now call me paranoid, but if I hadn't been careful, who knows what would've happened. It taught me a very good lesson on being gay in immigrant areas.

105,"You have to get your shit in order and rather sooner than later, because the worse it gets, the harder it will be to get out of it again. Deal with it NOW. 

First, depending on you situation, your parents might be legally obligated to financially support you. This is definitely the case if you're a student or in your first apprenticeship. In many ways, this is a very good time to lawyer up. 

You won't even have to pay for that lawyer. Courts usually offer free legal advice a couple of times per month. Do that ASAP. There's a ton of possibilities from BAföG to Wohngeld to ALG2 to suing your parents. All of that if for free if you're willing to accept help and your income is low. (If you're eligible for BAföG, which is not only the case if you're a university student, they'll even do that for you!) If you're a student or at least living in a university town, the AStA and/or Studierendenwerk should have a Sozialberatung and maybe even a Rechtsberatung that can and will help you.

What your parents did was despicable. Courts, lawyers, law and basically everyone you will ask for help will agree on that. Don't hesitate to reach out. If you have more specific questions, PM me. 

Edit: Somehow missed that you wrote that you're a student. Go to the Studierendenwerk today. Explain that you're homeless and without finances because your parents are major cunts. It's their job to help you. "
106,"Honestly, my advice:  
  
Let go. You are 21 years old. First and foremost, the biggest relationship you should be concerned about is with yourself and how happy you are.  
  
Stop looking at statistics because they are irrelevant when it comes down to love.  
  
Don't demonize people who are promiscuous. That is the climate of our culture, and they are free to live their lives that way. Yes, men are sexual beings and there is a lot of hardship trying to find serious, monogamous relationships in the community...but that doesn't mean there aren't people like you out there. You just have to be true to yourself and let others be true to who they are.
  
You should use this time to build yourself, and date guys so you can find out what qualities you like, and what qualities are definite no-no's in a relationship.  
  
I know you are a hopeless romantic. I am one as well. Being out for about 9 years now (I'm 26 now) has taught me that even though I crave love, the relationships I have had failed because either me or my partner, or both us, didn't take the time to get to know who we were and what we wanted.  
  
The better you get to know yourself, the more you will be able to follow your instincts when it comes down to what guys to chase and what guys to let go. "
107,"Moral of the story: do not tell straight guys you like them. If you think he might not be straight even though he says he is, it is purely wishful thinking on your part. If he claims to be straight, that's it. He's off limits. Don't be an asshole and confess your inability to accept reality. "
108,"If he's hot, hell yeah. "
109,"Well I would say you overreacted with your dad. 21 years old is an appropriate age to be told something like that. Plus, he's supporting and loving. 

As for your mom, well.......u don't have to cut her out but you don't have to take shit from her either. "
110,Decent sentiment. Unless you're no one else's type either....
111,That last paragraph summed up the ideal gay life.
112,"We used to start out in the same bed every single night, then whichever one of us was in the other's bed would go to his own.  I am all over the place when I sleep and need it ice cold in the room, and he was always hot and his snoring would set off a seismograph.  So that's how we did it.  Kind of like saying *we wished we could spend all night together, but we can't*.  

We also *never* once used each other's bathroom or shower.

When we traveled, we would get 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suites so our regular patterns could continue uninterrupted.  "
113,"My SO and I have emoji pillows of the emojis we use for each other when we text. When one of us has to travel we take the pillow representing the other and use it as a surrogate cuddle buddy when sleeping. We are in our mid-20s. :)

*eyeroll*

Tell him to stop fucking guys then. This may be the first time it happens to him, but it will not be the last. Even the most meticulous bottoms have an accident every now and then, and the ones who say they don't are lying like hell.

You'll get the usual spill here from guys about dieting a certain way, blah blah blah...but it all comes down to knowing your body, and trying to do your best to minimize accidents from happening (not engaging in spontaneous sex unless you're sure you're in the clear, taking a good dump and washing up, and in some cases, douching). It is what it is. "
117,"Thank God you said you've been dating 6 months. I had a feeling you were going to say you two had been dating two weeks. 😂

119,"You gave someone up because you didn't like them physically in spite of the fact that they treated you well and you were compatible in every other way. (Even family, now wtf that is a rare thing to hear.) Did you even take them to the gym or give them tips/pointers?

1000 people will tell me I am wrong, and I hope they do. But I'm here to tell you that you made one of the dumbest decisions you ever could have. There are tons of attractive guys out there, but how many will ever get along with you at the same level? Looks fade, guys get into their 30s and most nosedive into oblivion looks wise at that age. Open up scruff, grindr, etc. Hot isn't a commodity anymore, at least it never has been for me.

#Me? I can find hot ANYWHERE. I can walk down the street on a sunny day and pass by so many. But how many will I form a deep and meaningful bond with? I'd doubt less than 5%. 

^^ Yeah I'm gonna bold that because I think a lot of guys here think with their dick and forget in the real world looks mean boo-all in a stable happy relationship. Moderate level of attraction is fine, but that super hot 10/10 working at Arbys? Not so hot when you realize he ain't got shit. (That's why so many hot guys get into porn, because they can't even pay their rent. BAM real world for you.)

But a man that respects me (authentically), has a spine, someone I ENJOY talking to, and someone I can feel open/safe/stable with, someone who has a career going, someone who is a responsible adult, etc? HOOOO boy, wow that list of potential candidates just got axed down to about 10% if I am lucky-- and I'm not lucky this way so let's be real and out of 100 guys maybe 5 get along with me on THIS level that.

I can't even talk on a reasonable adult level with 50% of them because they're too busy talking about sex, past boyfriends and other garbage during our first meet up / ""date"". Let alone anything deep/personal, dare I not go down that dark path.

Good to fuck and then throw to the street. I don't expect them to know jack squat, because 90% of them don't.

To me? I think this is really hollow and vapid. But hey, you will ultimately (it will happen) find some hot guy and he'll walk into your life and treat you like shit. I mean, that's what you're after right. Long as he's hot, fuck the rest?

And before people tell me I am a pessimist/wrong, go ahead tell me that, but at the end of the day most people on this sub with any  experience in real life know I'm being real."
120,"He didn't make a scene, and at least acted like he accepted the ""video games"" excuse, so it's probably cool.  Relax and go on like nothing happened.  Chances are, even if he knew what was happening he understands that things like this aren't unusual with friends."

I walk in, trailing behind them (I'm sure my eyes were saucers, taking it all in) and this tall, buff dude steps in front of me and tells me how cute I am. I said thanks and try to step past him to catch up and instead all of a sudden I'm looking at the floor. He had picked me up in a firemans carry and started walking off with me like friggin' King Kong. Luckily the same bouncer spotted what was going on, got me down and he kicked the dude out while I booked it to find my brother. Turns out dude was super wasted and had been kicked out for being aggressive before. 

It was long enough ago that I tell the story with a light heart, but I definitely didn't bother stepping foot into a club until I was 21."

129,"It is genuinely stupid.

There seems to be this new idea that PrEP grants people immunity to infection, and thus condoms are obsolete. Which is false.

The guy you liked clearly did not like you enough to actually care about your safety and use condoms. That is shitty.

And the whole ""i can't get hard while wearing a condom"" thing is a load of crap because A) they should already be hard B) they have special condoms with all sorts of extra goodies that make it feel about the same as bareback C) unless the dude's dick was large enough that the condoms he used restricted bloodflow, it's a load of shit.

Guys can be reckless idiots. Even moreso lately.

Here's the best analogy I've heard. You're on a plane and the pilot dies. You have to pick someone to take over and your only choice is between an imbecile who doesn't know how the fly the plane and a crook who *does* know how the fly the plane. **Your only choice is the crook**, so yesterday I held my nose and voted for a hawkish corrupt Democrat for President.

160,"Your friend has absolutely zero perspective on the  incredible turmoil of emotions that went on inside his younger brother's head, *perhaps starting as young as say, 12 years old.*  Having lived through that myself when I was a teen, I describe it as having this massive war inside my brain, trying desperately to figure out that I was not some totally fucked up, sexual deviant pervert.  Mind you, I didn't grow up in a particularly religious household, having to hear church sermons describe being gay as intrinsically evil, nor having to listen to homophobic diatribes from my parents, siblings, extended family, friends and people in the community on a regular basis.  I suppose this is the difference between my having been able to survive those years, and this poor kid who lost that war in his head.

For some perspective, look at some of the [writings of Pope John Paul II](http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/st-pope-john-paul-ii-pope-benedict-gay-marriage-clear-and-emphatic), a man who while serving as Pope for 27 years was beloved around the world, considered to be a very kind hearted man, and who was ultimately declared a Saint by the Catholic Church.  Here are some quotes from his writing -

 -   Catholics in general have a duty to clearly oppose homosexual marriage, a Catholic politician “has a moral duty to express his opposition clearly and publicly and to vote against” such unions, and if it already is the law, the politician still must oppose it and has a “duty to witness to the truth.”

 - “Legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behavior, with the consequence of making it a model in present-day society, but would also obscure basic values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity.""

 - “The Church cannot fail to defend these values, for the good of men and women and for the good of society itself.”

 - ""homosexuality is a troubling moral and social phenomenon,” and especially so where gay unions are given legal recognition and include “the possibility of adopting children.”

 - ""No ideology can erase from the human spirit the certainty that marriage exists solely between a man and a woman.” 


For me, this is all bullshit of the highest order, totally evil shit.  But, I can reason it through the prism of having a fully formed adult brain, able to have my own rational thinking on the subject.   As opposed to this poor kid when he was 15, having no ability to see through the evil nature of these kind of writings.  And this, from a Church with over 1 billion people, considered to be one of the most respected religions in the world.  Some kids have no chance to survive growing up in environments where this is what everybody around them believe gay people are  - intrinsically evil and a threat to the fabric of society - and tragically, your friend's brother was one of those.  How many young gay lives have been lost/wrecked because of the writings of Pope John Paul II? Or, from people like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Tony Perkins?

And yes, I agree with you - he and his family played a significant role in his suicide, gasoline on a burning fire. 100% agree with that."

You have low self-esteem so you tell yourself that no one will love you and want to be with you, so hell, you'll take whatever you can get. **But this lack of self-belief is what undermines you.** I guarantee if you stand up to him, a) he'll back down and try to work on you until you give in again OR b) he'll exit your life, you'll discover some self-respect and you'll attract a better person into your life.

Each to their own. I'd stamp out racism within the community, it's so rife. I experience more racism in the community than I do in everyday life. I'd promote safe sex (lol), and stop putting so much emphasis on things like PrEP. It's great, it's ground breaking, but it still isn't our saving grace. I'd promote more safe, non-clubby spaces for gays etc - just because i feel like apps and bars are the only places to meet people these days. I don't know why I keep saying 'I'd promote' - totally derailing from the question lol.

I start sucking through the fabric and then after a while I just pull it out and straight out just start blowing him.
