0,"Oh, oh... Me, me... At 3:00 AM today. Watching the results with my boyfriend. It was getting quite obvious Trump was gonna win and he was bitching... It was starting to annoy me so I told him to drop his pants... Started on the living room floor, moved to the couch, when trump started his speech he told me to turn the TV off and finally moved to the bedroom where I gave him some of my best BJ moves and then he fucked my brains out... It was a little past 4:00 AM by the time we were done. Had to be up by 8 AM :-(

In all honesty, it felt so good to get laid knowing Trump won. It's as though we were saying fuck you right to his face."
1,I predict this thread will be filled with cute stuff that'll make me jealous lol.
2,"Boyfriend and I already decided to get married next week if Trump wins. We might move to Ireland since he's homesick anyway and I don't feel welcome here anymore. 

Edit: welp. Guess we're buying wedding rings tomorrow."
3,"I'm 25 years old. Going 26. I've never been on a real date and never been in a relationship. I hated my job, I'm not hot, I'm not in shape, I weighed 205lb (I'm 5'7"" so that's clinically obese), shitty roommates, and I'm pretty sure I have clinical depression and need to see a doctor. That was in 2015. So in 2016 I said:

Fuck it, I'll talk to that old highschool friend from 6 years ago. He helped me get my job.

Fuck it, I'll stop drinking soda, shits bad anyways. Lost 35 lbs.

Fuck it, I'll save up and get my own damn place. I move in December.

Fuck it, I'll just ask my cute friend out on a date, he said yes and we're going kayaking.

Fuck it, I'll go see a doctor for my depression...tomorrow...maybe next week...it's a work in progress. 

I struggle with depression even when I have things going for me. I should seek professional help, but it's so hard to start getting help for some reason. I have no motivation sometimes. "
4,"Terrified. 

People who voted for Trump are uneducated, period. There is no opinion on that, they literally know nothing about politics and never did any research (or their ""research"" was from non-reputable sources.) 

We don't let someone with no experience become a surgeon, or a lawyer, or the commander of an army brigade, why the hell did we elect someone with zero experience to run the fucking country? "
5,Someone get this man a glass of water.
6,"I sucked a dick today. It's my favorite dick. Nice, thick, veiny, uncut. He's been lying in bed in post-orgasmic bliss for about an hour, drifting in and out of sleep, mumbling occasional I love yous.

We're getting married next week. I'd be marrying him even if he didn't have a dick."
7,"Read your original post. Now reading this one. Sweetheart, don't be blind to the obvious. You can believe him all you want, but chances are, he's not on there for a ""support system"" he's on there for a ""get-my-dick-wet-system."" - and who the *fuck* compares you to not **one** but **both** of their exes? OP, dump his sorry ass and move on to someone who will respect you."
8,"He compared our Okcupid profiles and made a point of highlighting that we were 92% sexually compatible. Then fantasized to me about how if we were a couple, we would have incredible sex. 

Straight as an arrow. "
9,"He loves to smack my ass super hard whenever I am laying on the bed watching videos or scrolling though Reddit.

He also waits till I'm brushing my teeth to grab me by the waist and fake hump me. 

Oh and he will sometimes ask if I love him and when I say yes he'Il call me gay or say ""what a fag"". 

We have a weird/awesome relationship."
10,Not hiding your computer screen when watching or reading something gay related seems like a pretty casual way to do it. 
11,Your ex seems COOL AF to have your back.  Keep the friendship.   Don't mess around with whores without morals.
12,White gays who voted for Trump forgot that they are a hated minority. You voted in the people who would gladly tie you up with rope and drag you across a dirt road with their pickup trucks. 
13,Better to be by yourself than with someone who you're incompatible with.
14,Everyday
15,"He might have been crushing on you a bit and is laying low to keep his emotions from going crazy. It doesn't mean he was thinking about you physically or anything, but that he could have just been feeling extremely close emotionally. He's probably hoping his feelings cool a bit before he gets close again.

I'd give it time and some space and just test the waters every week or two about how he's doing and if he wants to hang out. Just leave room for him to opt in and he'll probably eventually take you up on it."
16,"For me, it would be [this hottie](http://imgur.com/8cGCsuk)."
17,My boyfriend does this silly thing where he pretends to not exist. He's REALLY good at it. 
18,"I think you're being overly optimistic. We all felt far too confident in Hilarys ability to defeat trump, and look where we are now. The amount of apathy the Democrats have displayed this cycle has screwed us time and time again. "
19,Your title is feigning neutrality when it doesn't need to for an election like this. Tell everyone you know to vote for Hillary Clinton period!
20,"Blew a friend of mine over the weekend.  He's not been having any luck with guys lately and he really needed it.  He's big and thick and I got as much out of it as he did.  He doesn't usually get a ""swallower"" so I was sort of a special treat for him."
21,Volume to level 100. Accidentally on purpose unplug headphones while watching HOT ANAL PENETRATION. Or maybe that's too subtle xD
22,I keep flip-flopping between desperately needing companionship and being happy alone.
23,"I ran into this as well. I went for a beer with the guy and we talked about it. He thought we were good enough friends that I should have told him so I asked him why he wanted to know and he came back with a bunch of answers that didn't quite add up. We bullshitted more and a beer or two later I asked him what the real reason he was bent was. 

I want to think it was the beer that loosened his tongue, he said ""I wouldn't have been mad that you like dick. Everyone likes something. I'm mad because you didn't trust me enough. I thought we were friends.""

I don't know how true that was and he didn't seem like he was bent because he was interested so it kind of makes sense. 

It's what I ran with and I apologized. We're no longer friends because of it."
24,Most people here didnt vote for him
25,"My mom abandoned us shortly after she gave birth to me. Died of some type of cancer a couple of months later. Its only been me and my dad for as long as I can remember. 


My dads an awesome dad though, he tried his hardest to fill the gap left by an absent mother and he's loved me with all of his heart and I love him back even more. 


My dad even tried to date for a while, but I used to hold on to my dad for dear life because I thought he was all i had left and I was super afraid to lose him, so I would make his dates lives a living hell when they would come home with him. We still laugh about it today. Eventually he stopped dating (around the time I turned 6) and from age 6 to 16 all my dad did was raise me. I can't tell you how much that makes me love my dad, that he just completely shut off the entire romantic part of his life just for me for that long. 


Luckily, however, he was able to meet someone when I turned 17 and they're married now, so I'm happy he's got someone to grow older with. 


I still remember how me and my dad used to stay up late and play board games and uno while watching star wars and star trek. I remember when I was a really little kid (like 4 or 5) I used to run up and down the halls in my underwear for no apparent reason until my dad would scoop me up and put me in the bed with him. I also remember some mornings when I would wake up, and that fucking blues clues thing would be on the TV, I would be in my dads bed because I had a nightmare the night before, and my dad would be in the bathroom shaving, getting ready for the day. Its pretty amazing how vividly I remember small insignificant stuff like that.


My dads a major nerd, but my dad was like, the attractive type of nerd with the buff chest and the muscles and all that, so I got all the good genes from my dad, the smarts and the looks, lol. I can also rock glasses, just like my dad, lol. Gotta love a parent when they give you all the killer traits. 


Some people have asked me if I could, would I go back in time and add my mom to my life. The answer is, sadly, no. I loved the way I was raised, I love my dad, I loved my childhood, and I think he did a fucking kick ass job, so I am actually happy with the way my life worked out. My dad gave me a loving home, a stable environment, met ever need and want I had, gave me a positive role model, and was basically my tutor all the way through school. He did all that you can ask a single person to do and more. 


All in all, my relationship with my parent is fucking lit. Writing this out actually makes me want to call my dad and tell him how much I love him but I'm sure he's asleep right now so I'll wait till the morning. I remember being a kid and wanting to grow up and be like my dad so fast, I wish I could go back in time and tell my bitch ass to sit down somewhere."
26,"Mine showers with the lights off because I installed an LED shower head a few years ago, now he turns my bathroom into a night club, and he hates when I ~~fold~~ roll his socks."
27,"I laughed and shut the door because the whole thing was funny, but then later I went home and jerked off to it."
28,"Well they can try to legislate whatever they want, but until the makeup of the supreme court fundamentally changes, they won't get very far. Panic time hits if he gets two court nominees appointed. There is no realistic way he could get a constitutional amendment passed to bypass the court.  "
29,Same with me. One of my friends in high school was really touchy. He would often rub my thigh randomly during class. Sometimes he would just grab my butt if we're just standing around and wont let go until we're done talking. Or wrap his arms around me from my back. Or give me a random massage. No. He didnt know I was gay. Guys were just really secure with their sexuality in my school. Some of us would sit on each other's laps regularly in the commons too. Or rub crotches together as a joke.  Everyone was super comfortable with each other since it was a really small school so we all grew pretty close to each other.
30,Like the Republican Senate and the Republican Congress and the soon to be Conservative controlled Supreme Court. So many wonderful checks and balances.
31,Irish man here. I will be watching the news and judging your decision from afar. Good luck my friends ;) 
32,"That's not even the best pic of him.

"
33,His hands always get really cold when he's on computer so he pretty often comes to me and sticks them under my shirt. I'm still not sure if I like it or hate it.
34,"Trump ran on the ""I'm pissed off"" platform.  His supporters didn't really care about the reality of anything, about what sort of man they were electing, etc.  He just parroted every ""I'm mad as hell"" BS thing out there, whether he believed it or not.  He could have said ""Space aliens are screwing up TV shows, and I'm not going to take it!"" and his supporters would have jumped right on board.  "
35,"When we're talking in bed or on the couch, he always likes to have me lie down with my head on his lap and trace my face with his finger as we talk. He says he likes the view.

And when we began, when we're eating I'd sometimes be distracted by my phone. He doesn't like that so whenever I do so, he'd sneak a piece of food into my plate or get one out of it like superfast."
36,"Trump won because people are angry.  They're angry because their lives aren't improving and they've heard the same old shtick from every Presidential candidate since the Clinton years.  Everything energized Trump's voters.  Especially the fact that his ""party""--the name which he appears to have simply co-opted because it was the only vulnerable party that would let him get him to the Presidency--did not, and does not even WANT him.

This is a huge message to both parties, in my opinion.  A lot of voters out there have lives in perpetual decline.  They're maybe not the swiftest people out there, but they're still people.  They have families that they love, and they are concerned that they are going to end up starving and out in the cold.  So if someone tells them that illegal immigrants are sucking whatever shred of prosperity they would have had out of the country, then they're not going to like illegal immigrants.  If someone tells them that gays are somehow jeopardizing their poor hungry family they are trying to figure out how to feed, then they're not going to like gays.  

So yeah, a lot of people are ignorant and don't really know shit about social issues, don't know about doing the right thing, and they don't care.  But they've been hearing the same BS from every candidate since they can remember, and their lives have not improved.  Trump energized these people.  It's amazing, really.  But a big wake up call on a whole lot of levels that are more serious than just ""ignorance""."
37,[BUT WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CobK-V3WgAA5JLu.jpg) 
38,Hard to tell. Straight guys can be so gay sometimes.
39,"2017, 2018, 2019... just vote in every election. get an absentee ballot and drop it in the mail.

progressives complain about not having progressives in the Senate and House, but then off-year and midterm elections come and the only people who bother to vote are old people and hardcore establishment types.

voting in midterms and primaries was exactly how the Tea Party was able to reshape the Republican party, there's no reason why progressives couldn't do something similar to the Democrats."
40,A healthy relationship you've got going there. 
41," &gt;literally shat on by so many people

They really should change this. I don't see why this makes people more qualified to be doctors. "
42,"Yeah like other comments said, just act like a straight person does about it. They don't hide the stuff they read or watch, they casually converse about dates and partners. That's my way of informally letting ppl know I'm not straight...not acting like it's a thing I need to censor. I usually casually bring up my boyfriend; an example being if my new friend brings up a movie or tv show that I know I've seen with my bf....I'll just mention that he introduced me to it, then move on to further comment on the movie/show or other conversation. If they want to call me out on it I'll just be like yeah and? Lol. That's on them. We don't call them out on casual mentions of their straightness. If we create that super casual coming out by not ""coming out"" culture eventually we won't even need to make a big deal of it....people will see there is no need. I mean a straight guy doesn't feel the need to warn you that he has a gf, or is into girls....so why should we. They just talk about it with the same easygoing air of any other topic. Emulate that"
43,"Trump doesn't give a shit about LGBT people one way or another. He's going to have many more important things to worry about than pandering to a minority of Americans who actually care enough to try to set back our rights. He's not going to waste time fighting a losing battle. I predict 4 years of the status quo. I don't see any significant progression for the cause nor regression, and honestly that's not the worst thing that can happen. And tbh, Pence has about as much control over Trump as you and I do."
44,"My fiancé will sing little made-up songs about whatever he's doing at the moment, or whatever he's feeling. Almost like Jess from New Girl, you know?"
45,"But that court shift is very likely to happen. It's in his 100 day plan to at least get the one.  Hopefully no one else leaves, but I've heard there's potential for 3 justice vacancies. "
46,"TLDR ""My experience was different, so yours isn't valid."""
47,"Men bond with trust. It's just the way it is. You tell me a secret and if I'm a friend I'll keep it. It's the unspoken bond of brotherhood and many gay men don't have access or knowledge of that life because historically we've generally been excluded from that part of male life.

My friend thought our friendship was at a 10 and then after finding out I like dick, he felt it was at a 3. He didn't think he knew me at all because I had a part of my life I kept separate from everyone.

Sure it was none of his business but that's not what you're asking or even why he was concerned. He felt I lied to him and I can't argue with it. I did lie by omission and paid the price for it."
48,"""So I was sucking this dick, right?"""
49,"no, because i don't have to prove any of those things to anyone i don't care about. "
50,"I was in one of those ""fell in love with my straight best friend..."" things. One day, he could tell I was not in a good place with him, he didn't know what else to do, so he put his hand flat on my cheek, and kissed his hand. I guess he wanted to kiss me but didn't actually want it to be like an actual kiss... I dunno, that's definitely not straight though..."
51,"Silver lining is that this might destroy the Republican party.  Trump will likely be a one-term president.  Democrats will win in 2020 with a landslide victory and take back the Senate/House.  They'll be able to gerrymander the districts in the Democrats' favor making it difficult for the Republicans to take Congress until 2030.  Who knows if Hillary had won this year, maybe she would have been very unpopular and  Cruz would have won in 2020."
52,No.
53,"Because I missed the opportunity to vote for Hitler 80 years ago, and Trump is the closest thing I can find. /s"
54,"Okay, maybe not technically caught, but still pretty hot. My group of friends in high school were pretty open with being naked. We went streaking more than a few times, and sometimes one of us would do something silly while naked Jackass still.

Anyways, one day shortly after we both graduated I was at my friend Arley's house, and he was using the restroom and called me in because he wanted to show me something. I opened the door and saw a straight ahead view of him completely naked, sitting on the toilet, going to town on his cock. I'll be honest, my friend was pretty hot. He had blond hair, tan skin from surfing a lot, an athletic body, and a huge cock. So yeah, not the worst ""prank"" to have happen."
55,"scared? no, but I live in a blue state and am moving to another blue state. if I lived in a red state I'd GTFO now. trumpco are committed to a states' rights platform, so where you live will matter. "
56,"&gt;I am uncut (since birth)

What as opposed to the people who became uncut later on in life?"
57,You aren't overreacting and you need to find a new MHP.
58,"Being gay in the black community is still a huge taboo. As long as black people keep teaching their boys that there is something wrong with gay people Or being gay, black men will still be on the DL. It's really a problem with lots of closeted gay men in general. But black people tend to be more culturally conservative. They've eased up over the years on more feminine men. Because that's something they can't control in their minds.  But when a more masculine man is gay, it all goes back to choice or they were feminized in some kind of way. It's annoying. The last guy I dated hated the idea of coming off like a couple. He was from the hood and still had hood mentality. Where he came from, it was really only ok for the feminine guys to be gay. "
59,Yes all we care about is sucking cock. Nice job

That's pretty funny when you think about it. "

68,Trump is a egomaniac who has literally no place in the white House. Like none at all.
69,"I feel so bad for both of them. Instead of being able to retire with grace, they're basically forced to spend their last years on the bench desperately hoping they can hold out until 2020. And if a Republican takes power in 2020 as well, SCOTUS is toast."
70,Pull his pants down to ask me if his pubes were okay because he had trimmed for the first time for his gf.

73,"IMO it's never shallow or bad to have your primary motivation for working out be ""i want to look good.""

The only time you should ever consider bad/negative motivation is when you're doing it out of shame or an ultimatum from a partner.

Ultimately, the only way you can push yourself to do that last rep or increase your lifts is WANTING TO FOR YOURSELF."
74,"Off the top of my mind:
1) I'm really talkative, sometimes he drifts off in the middle of a conversation and loses track of what I was saying! But he's honest about it xD 
2) Water has to be just the right temperature before he enters the shower with me
3) He likes to grab my ass really vigorously when I'm not counting on it

87,"no, I love them because I am a needy bitch"
88,"Best: I was visiting the Phoenix area to check out a few places to move to. I met a Latino guy on A4A, and he came to my hotel room. He had a huge size dick and knew how to use it. He was passionate and dominating. He bent me so many ways, and fucked me so good. It was a different kind of sex. It felt like I was on Cloud 9. He knew how to talk dirty to me, and made me edge so many times. We fucked for hours and finally he made me cum. That happened about 6 years ago and I still think about it to this day. 

Worse: One of my good friends invited me to a house party. This guy was eyeing me, and my friend so happened to know the guy. We hit it off and he decided to take me up stairs to one of the bedrooms. Everything started to get hot and heavy and he started to straddle me. During the heat of the moment I couldn't help, but notice a small box fan that was right above his head that was held on by a single nail. As he started to insert my cock into him he moaned deeply and kept moving his head in all sorts of direction. All of a sudden his head hit the little box fan and it fell onto my face. It hurt really bad and I started bleeding through my nose. I yelled at the guy to get off me and he said, ""just keep going, just kept going!"" I had to forcibly take him off me when he realized what just happened. He grabbed his clothes and said, ""umm I'm going to go now"" as I was bleeding all over. I had grab my wifebeater and clean what I could. I immediately went the the restroom and finally got myself together. I went down stairs to the party everyone looked at me holding my bloody wifebeater and stains on my pants, and bursted out laughing. Apparently the guy ran downstairs and halled ass out of the house. Everyone was confused until They saw me come down. It was pretty embarrassing. "

124,"Walked in on roommate.  We were really open about masturbation talk previously.  Ended up jerking off together.  This broke the ice and we did it more times, or would do it in the room if the other was there when we were going to sleep or in the morning.  One time we jerked each other off. 

Another time I got walked in on by a neighbor in the dorms because it was the middle of the day, nobody was around, and my roommate apparently told the neighbor in some class they had together (without my knowledge), that the neighbor could just walk in and borrow a pair of socks.  So I'm in bed, and all of a sudden my neighbor is standing there and I'm covering up with a blanket.  The neighbor apologized and explained why he was there.  I said, not a big deal, then I made up some bullshit about getting ready to take a nap.

He smiled and said, ""Yeah I'm going to take a nap in like five minutes,"" and he emphasized *take a nap* because obviously that's exactly what I was not doing.

I had heard rumors that this guy was gay or bi or curious at least.  So I figured, fuck it.  I'm going to ask.

""So... want to hang out here for a little?""  As it turned out, he did want to hang out for a little bit...

Walked in on another fraternity brother one time... we laughed.  Nothing happened, just jokes."

130,"Hey, I know that there are a lot of fears floating around regarding Trump and gay marriage, so I thought I'd repost this. I wrote this post a while back and it was well-received, so maybe it can assuage somebody's fears. This is my take on the subject from a legal-constitutional POV.

Even if he wanted to, Trump's Justices couldn't overturn Obergefell. A lot of people say this is going to happen if he gets elected, but it has absolutely no basis in the jurisprudence of fundamental rights. There are valid reasons not to want Trump selecting SCOTUS nominees, but this is not one of them. Obergefell is here to stay.

First, marriage is a fundamental right, which is a special Constitutional term encompassing, essentially, all of the most important rights that we have by virtue of being U.S. Citizens. Because marriage is a fundamental right, that means there are a tremendous amount of procedural protections in place to make sure your right to marry freely is preserved. These protections are notoriously difficult to overcome. Fundamental rights are just that--fundamental. You have them not because you are a part of a protected class, but because you are an American. In other words, your being gay has nothing to do with it. Everyone has it regardless of sexuality. Neither states nor the federal government can pass laws that abrogate fundamental rights, and to the extent that they restrict your ability to exercise them, those laws must be narrowly tailored for a compelling government purpose. This language is called ""strict scrutiny,"" and it refers to the way courts interpret statutes being challenged as unconstitutional. More on that in a second. Only the Court can decide whether something is or is not a fundamental right, and the other branches of government are bound by that determination. Congress, for instance, no matter how many Evangelical Christians were in it, couldn't decide tomorrow to pass a law defining marriage as ""natural"" marriage between a man and a woman. It would definitely be struck down. Only courts can decide what things constitute fundamental rights. Strict scrutiny, by the way, is also the way courts look at laws that discriminate against people based on their race. Said another way, judges examining restrictions on fundamental rights will look at the government's case with an inherent skepticism. When the court applies that level of scrutiny, it's on the state, rather than the person bringing the claim, to justify why the restriction is necessary. In practice, laws analyzed under strict scrutiny are almost ALWAYS struck down. That's how high the government's burden of persuasion is. Essentially, they must prove both that their reason for restricting fundamental rights is a compelling reason, and that the means they've used to satisfy that reason restricts that right only as much as is necessary to accomplish the underlying governmental purpose. Please take my word for it when I say this is a nigh impossible burden to meet.

Second, remember how cases get to the Supreme Court in the first place. Courts are inherently reactive, rather than proactive, entities. This means that they cannot decide the constitutionality of a statute unless it's argued before them in a case. In other words, what would have to happen for the SCOTUS to overturn Obergefell is as follows; State A passes a law banning or restricting gay marriage. That law is challenged in federal court, and eventually makes its way all the way to SCOTUS. In the extremely unlikely event that it actually makes its way up the appellate chain, SCOTUS has to decide to actually hear it. This is enormously unlikely because the lower courts will all be bound by the ruling in Obergefell. Let's assume that every sitting lower court judge strokes out or decides to make a plainly incorrect legal ruling, and that SCOTUS decides to hear the issue again. Even then, Justices, even those on the Supreme Court, can't just overturn precedent because they feel like it. There has to be an articulated reason why the previous ruling was incorrect. In this case, Trump's SCOTUS would have to decide either (1) that gay marriage is not protected by the fundamental right to marry or (2) that marriage is in itself not a fundamental right at all. (1) will not happen because the government's burden of proof is monumental in these types of cases. Like I said, the government basically never wins under strict scrutiny. Remember, we aren't even talking about the adoption of children, but the right to marry. As in, the right of two people to decide to come together in matrimony in such a way that affects nobody else. This is so closely tied to issues of Due Process and the Freedom of Association that I can say with absolute certainty that the government couldn't produce enough factual proof to make out that claim in such a way as to satisfy strict scrutiny. (2) is even less likely because it would plainly contradict decades of similar rulings, including those which struck down laws banning interracial marriage. Deciding that the right to marry doesn't apply to gay people alone is plainly inconsistent with a tremendous amount of legal precedent.

Finally, remember that gay marriage IS legal now, and that married couples all across the country currently enjoy all of the rights that come with marriage, such as favorable tax treatment and inheritance of property. These types of interests are property interests, and a law restricting gay marriage would infringe on them. The government can't just deprive people of their life, liberty, or property without a good reason. If it came up on appeal, in addition to the issue of fundamental rights, the government would also have to prove that the restriction didn't violate Due Process.

TL;DR--there are so many legal impossibilities that would have to take place for Obergefell to be overturned that you can safely expect it not to happen. Like I said, however, there are valid reasons why you don't want Trump appointing SCOTUS justices, this just isn't one of them. Workplace discrimination, rental protections, and suspect classification are all important reasons not to vote for Trump...but any candidate who has it in their tiny little brain that marriage equality is going anywhere has an absolutely futile task before them."

147,"I think the bigger picture should scare you more - that your country is being held hostage by uneducated, gun-toting theocrats. Trump is a symbol of them, but the numbers are there. Ultimately this is what should scare the LGBT population."
148,The biggest red flag is Mike Pence. Donald is an overweight 70 year old about to take on the most stressful job in the world. No one should vote for him unless they're comfortable with the very real possibility that he dies in office and Pence becomes President (I say the same thing about Clinton and Kaine). And personally the idea of a candidate who supports discriminating against LGBT and actively promotes and supports GAY CONVERSION THERAPY is disgusting. Pence makes Ted Cruz look moderate and it's a shame he hasn't been more of a focus by the media.

Trump himself doesn't matter at all to the voters. He could be a talking dildo and nobody will give a shit. It was the anger, the suppression that he invoked from the mass majority of people. The anger every time they were to swallow their opinions due to political correctness. Every time a non-educated man wants to say something and was told you don't know anything about those Muslim/gay people so shut the fuck up. Well can you explain to them, to teach how life is also hard for those people, to make them understand each other, instead of shoving this giant sign onto their face? 'Why aren't our lives getting better?' It was misunderstanding and lack of explanation that pushed them into the  'I'm not buying this democrat bullshit again' stage."
170,"It's a different world. I weighed about 260 to 270 about a year and a half ago. I went down to 190 lbs. It was not only the weight that dropped, but I gained more muscle, and began to look fit.

I get so much dick pics, and ass pics that it's hilarious. I actually get to be more selective on guys now. Even attractive guys I have to be selvective. Sometimes when they message it comes off desperate or trashy.

Although I became ""hotter"", I still remember who I am. I'm a very easy going, laid-back, intelligent, dorky, compassionate person. I love connecting to anyone that I meet organically. I don't have Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Any sort of social outlet is Reddit. I remember how it is to be ignored and to be given the ""I'm better than you"" look. I stay grounded, because underneath it all we are good people and should be treated with the same respect all around. "

But you're just fine with being gay, and you don't need anyone's approval or guidance in regards to your sexuality, including any priest. Right now, you have a boyfriend, and you are learning how to share your life with a partner. If she has a problem with that, then she is really just proving that you were right to keep the fact that you were seeing your boyfriend from her before. How she chooses to respond to that will tell you everything about whether she loves you for who you actually are, or whether she only loves the lies that she told herself about you."
