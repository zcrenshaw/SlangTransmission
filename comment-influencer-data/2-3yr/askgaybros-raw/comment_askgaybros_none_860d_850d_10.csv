0,"Yes. Their children who are born and raised here in Amsterdam are very homophobic in general, especially those with lower education levels, which is most of them. Anyone who lives here knows that, go to a muslim majority neighbourhood and if you're openly homosexual, it won't be a pleasant experience.

It isn't just because they are muslim though, it's their lack of education and thus secularism combined with religious upbringing.


"
1,"Yes. I'm french and when I was in school i was bullied everyday by so called muslims. They often said I was going to hell, they called me names like ""zamel"" ( apparently it means fag in arabic ), they spat on me and humiliated me. I'm not  talking about like 3 people, they were dozens and it was literally everyday."

3,"You'd think so. Then you find out the hot gay twink who keeps bumping into you at the gym actually just wants to fuck old fat guys. 

Id avoid making assumptions because people are random and will surprise you.

"
4,Short guys.  They're fun to throw around and fuck.
5,"I get it, but I'm sick of people shaming those who came out in less than safe circumstances. They are usually teens, and the fact is that one grows up hoping and believing their parents' love is unconditional. Shaming teens who end up being kicked out just contributes to the already high LGBT teen suicide rate.  
  
I absolutely agree people in these situations should wait. But calling those who didn't wait stupid or idiots is unwarranted."
6,"Hey man I had the same experience (Asian mom, never saw my dad). Disastrous coming out when I was 16, but if it's any consolation, this experience will make you a lot stronger if you get through it. You dealt with the initial getting kicked out (especially in such a mean and ruthless way) well, so the next months will be hard but you'll be able to get through them. When I got kicked out, the first thing I did was got a job (sales, nothing glamorous), and worked my way until I could open my own business after my employer went under. It wasn't the railroad track to success my mom charted out for me, but it was a place of achievement nonetheless. Some pointers for getting through this hard time:

* If you're under 18, the first problem you'll have is you can't legally get a hotel room under 21 (most hotels because of minibars) and can't rent in many states under 18. You'll need a friend's mom or dad to sign your lease in some cases. If you're over, don't worry about it.

* The shelters and friends will help you in the short term, but know **the long term is on you**. It's terrible what happened to you, but other people's empathy only lasts so long before their resources run out (in the case of shelters and services) or their patience (in the case of friends). The longer you feel sorry for yourself, the worse it will turn out. Pick yourself up, because right now you've unfortunately been thrown into adulthood much earlier than you expected.

* Sleep, grades, social life - you can pick 1. The temptation will be to try to do everything, but that won't work. If you're providing for yourself, then hours of your day just disappear from the need to work and organize your life on your own.

* It'll hurt at first, but it gets more bearable over time. The longer you do anything, the easier it gets. So it might feel like you're in living hell when you go to school for hours then work until 9 every night, but people adjust to anything with enough time.

* Get a job that will teach you something. The first months will be hard no matter what, but they'll only get easier if your skills (and therefore your value) gets bigger. I picked sales but there's plenty of other jobs that hire a lot of people where you get better over time - you can try web development, fitness instructing, being a waiter, working at a bank, tutoring, tax preparing, or insurance. All those jobs will teach you something new and pay you decently well.

* **The cheaper you can live, the better**. Some hacks I found was that you can live off oatmeal and cheap eggs with some vegetables for a very long time. Supermarket bread and instant ramen are your best friends. A protein shake with whole milk replaces a meal.

* The big one: **whether you swim or sink depends on how much you can resist the temptation of your new freedom**. Your life plans just got thrown 50 miles off track, but you can win in this new direction if you put your mind to it and drown out temptations. I've seen other kids that got kicked out, had much better abilities, but lost out because they let their freedom get the better of them. When you're feeling bitter and have no parents around, drugs, partying every night, and sex will seem liberating. You'll even find yourself making excuses for why they'll be okay, but just know that they won't in the long run. You've got 24 hours and if you're anything like me, when you were in your parent's house you were used to being productive in only 4 or 5 of them. You have to know how to use 18 hours well and spend the rest sleeping.

* Finally, **focus on the day after tomorrow**. Know it'll get better and never lose sight of the light at the end of your tunnel. Whatever your goal is you can still get there if you work on it.

Good luck man and sorry this happened to you. If you get through this though, you'll be convinced nothing can stop you. If your dad is anything like my mom, then he'll regret his decision eventually, but don't count on it to save you through a tough time, because it may not happen for years. You're on your own now, and these next months will either be your undoing or your finest hour. But if they are your finest hour, then I can tell you from experience that you'll never have confidence issues again."

8,I am a white haired old man at this point.  If I only had a dollar for every friendship with a straight man I have seen destroyed in the wake of one of this drunken moments I would be a very rich man.  Straight is straight.  The average straight man will fuck the neighbors dog if he is drunk enough.  It doesn't mean he is a gay sleeping beauty waiting for your magic kiss.

12,"&gt;But what else can we tell him and how else can we support him?

Since he's only 14, you could probably have a talk with him about safe sex. While you don't have to worry about him getting someone pregnant, basis of protection from STIs will not only show him your support, but it can also save his health and life. I'm not gonna lie, popular gay lifestyle is full of dangers and you should make sure that your son is prepared for them."
13,Long hair unfortunately. Not a judgement against it it just can make the hottest guy unpalatable to me 
14,Gay men who showily disdain gay culture and make a big deal about how butch they are. 
15,"If he's watching you do hip thrusts from ""across the room"" you're the one who should be uncomfortable.

Although tbh, if your goal is to build up your butt (I assume to make it more appealing to other 'mos lol) it's not like your intentions are completely ""pure"" 😊; a guy might work his glutes as a side effect of ""leg day"" but no dude focuses on building up his ass unless he's trying to draw attention there..  But if you want a butt workout that won't ""make people uncomfortable"", Squats, lunges, and mule kicks are your friend"
16,"I used to live in a Muslim area in Paris, I never had any problems.  
There were always people chatting and sitting just by the door of my building. They were pretty friendly and one day, one of them told me ""we saw you with your boyfriend, yesterday, right ? Well, we'll keep an eye out so if we ever see him cheating, we'll tell you, Allah doesn't like cheaters"".  

So yeah, no problem so far."
17,The best thing about being gay: you get to hang around with your best friend doing guy stuff all day and then you get to go home and fuck his brains out all night.
18,"Yes. When I was in high school, before I knew I was gay (but beginning to question), I was driving with a group of friends by a gay bar. One of my friends leaned out the window and shouted, 'Faggot!' at some guy. 

I immediately pulled over in front of the bar and told my friend that if he ever did anything like that again I would throw him out of my car and if he didn't like it he could get out right there, right then. I was ready to beat the shit out of him. 

There were a whole bunch of guys milling around and I knew they'd have him for lunch, in all kinds of ways. Of course he shut up. But my other friends were shocked at me. They'd never seen me so angry. I was shocked at me. The anger seemed to come out of nowhere. 

I've always wondered what the guys at the bar thought. A car full of high school kids where one just yelled at them pulling up in front of the bar and the driver just screaming his rage and loosing it at a guy in the backseat, then driving off. 

Sad post script: Years later when I came out to those guys, that one in the back seat said he didn't believe me, that I'd have to prove it by blowing him. Even sadder, I did. (He was a lifeguard after all!) Saddest post post script: That was almost 40 years ago and he still holds the record for tiniest dick I've ever sucked. "
19,"Dude, do you have ANY information on him? If so, go to the police. This is blackmail and it is illegal. "
20,"&gt;Thanks bros for the comments you gave this old fart the confidence he needed to live again!

Yeah, don't refer to yourself as ""old fart"". If I was interested in a mature man (I'm not even that young) and he called himself an old fart, I would completely lose interest.

On another note, yay! Congrats!"

31,*Some* people can do this. It's just being a friend with benefits. However some people will say they are ok with it and will develop a romantic attraction that will totally mess up a friendship. And if they are friends with many of your friends it can screw up the group dynamic also. This has to be a risk you're willing to take. Unless you're certain he isn't the type to get attached this is risky (especially given that he's had a crush).

33,"""gay guys are so horny they will fuck a guy."""
34,"Canadian example: I heard a great story from a Somali guy at the pub about his gay cousin, who is quite fem.  Apparently the older generation of his family was worried he was sick and wanted to take him to the doctor or the Mosque.  The younger generation, i.e. all of his cousins, worked together to convince their respective parents to let the kid be.  As it happens, some of his cousins were hardened criminals, so there was an instance where a guy in jail called his Mom to explain why homophobia is wrong."
35,"While I am happy La Pen lost, the Fact that Le Pen made it this far shows French people are not happy either mainstream political left or right.

36,"Never had any problems with people my age (20s), but I know their parents are skeptical (as with anyone not used to something).

I don't take offense - I interpret this as a step in the right direction :) And the next generation doesn't care about my sexuality anyway, so, again, a step in the right direction."

45,"Down vote me all you want, but where is the Muslim outcry about this obvious and blatant systematic purging of a society which adheres to the belief systems  that they, the Muslim community, shares? 

As someone with many muslims in their family, It bothers me to no end when I hear the paltry cries of apologists that claim that it is not up to the adherents of the Islamic faith to ""defend"" their religion, or ""explain that they are peaceful"". 

But it really, truly, 100% is. Why? Because they Islamic faith preaches that the integrity of the Umma (brotherhood of muslims) is to be honoured and upheld at all costs. Even when that cost is a life. 

Muslims know and understand exactly what is happening in Chechnya, they are no different from you and I. They can read. They can think. But alas, the conclusion that they so obviously and maliciously reach must be: The murder of homosexuals is ok. The Umma is to be preserved and upheld at all costs. 

When groups demand to be treated equally, they march and show that they themselves are peaceful. That they themselves are the solution to the problem that they face. Whether it be marches for democracy in third world nations, or demands for reproductive rights in the richest countries in the world, the obligation to demand and protect the rights which we all embrace fall onto the shoulders of those that practice and benefit from them. 

Islam, both by the proxy of silence and the open adoration of these murders, sanctions these killings, and the muslim brotherhood of the world remains silent. "

What are ur thoughts on people who don't have any mental disability being in a relationship with people who do? Does it depend on some sort of spectrum?

50,"It's been my experience that guys tend to want what they don't have. Muscular body + mediocre face = most attracted to pretty face first (other factors secondary). This isn't a rule, but it is definitely something I've observed.

One thing to remember, too, is that basically anyone can get muscular if they try hard enough. Changing your face is another story...

My straight roommate didn't see me on the couch, but there he was walking butt ass naked to the kitchen and his cock was semi hard. And his body was so damn nice. I've seen it at the gym, But the nudity made it even better!

He turned around and saw me looking  and said ""fuck! Well you see it now, no need to hide"" and he drank his juice, naked in the kitchen, and went back to his room.

* I browse /lgbt/, /soc/, I join discord servers, exchange my kik username in those huge ""kik threads""

* I listen to the rain (IRL or with spotify)
* I search for some cool stuff to wear, because when you feel attractive as hell, you feel less lonely
* I do stuff that makes me proud of myself
* S H O W E R
* I go visit my sister
* I write something on my tumblr, because I'm especially inspired when I'm in a lonely mood
* I cook something I love
* I could go on but I guess I'll stop here

The key is, don't rely on others to make you feel less lonely, as weird as it sounds. If you're able to feel great by yourself, the loneliness will be much more bearable. It won't go away, it never truly goes away as long as you don't have a boyfriend; but you'll feel different.

If you're proud of yourself, love what you see in the mirror, love your quirks, your hobbies, then your state of mind shifts from ""I need someone in my life right now to save from this hell"" to ""I need someone in my life, but I'm fucking ready to welcome him, and as long as I wait, I'll just keep being a better person""

The ra caught him and sent him back to his apartment and he forgot I was there. He got naked in the room and started crawling into bed when he woke me up and I saw everything. Tall slim mocha twink, 6pack starting to show. Long dark as night soft cock dangling. He said fuck, put boxers on and told me to scooch over. We cuddled together and slept the rest of the night away. I woke up to his wood poking through his boxers. Went to a take a shower and jerked furiously "

134,"Or it's just sexual preference, just like not being attracted to people who are too fat, too skinny, too tall, too short, too hairy, etc. Stop whining about racism when there's assuredly things that you don't like in other people. It's not like you got fired from a job - someone just wasn't attracted to you. It's not like they're secretly attracted to you but just can't get over their inherent racism that's preventing them from being happy. Rejection on any level sucks but it's part of life. If you spend your whole life angry at other people for not being attracted to you you're going to have a bad time. "
135,"I agreed to meet a guy that was a few years older than myself, 23 at the time, who seemed like a nice guy. We met in the city, found a decent resturant to eat at, and we had a nice evening. 

He then asks if I want to go up to his hotel room. I was a little taken aback, because I didnt expect it to be that kind of date. I also found it kind of sketchy of him to get a hotel room, since he had told me he had his own apartment, so I asked him about that. He assures me he didnt do it because he expected anything, but rather because he was in the city on business and lived a ways off. Since we hit it off, he had figured he could ask. 

Anyways, I agreed. We paid, walked over to his hotel, and I was awestruck. 

His hotel was a 5 star hotel. At first I thought he was joking, but he wasnt. I felt so out of place and awkward walking through the reception, it wasnt even funny. 

That wasnt the real shit though. Turns out, his room was the *penthouse suite* of this fucking hotel, which I just couldnt *comprehend*. The room was bigger than an avarage apartment!  Not only that, but it had a freaking balcony overlooking the city! With a stunning view over the sea!! 

It was *classy* as fuck. 

So, we spent the rest of the evening drinking champaigne, eating fruit that he had delivered to us, and making out on the balcony.

Like..*damn*!

136,"""Wanna?""



""Sure."""
137,"Mine wasn't a defining moment; it was a defining person. I went to a really small school in a rural town. If the word ""rural"" just conjured up bucolic images of pastoral bliss, recalibrate. No one (with the notable exception of my parents) moved here, and everyone with the means moved away, leaving the community incredibly white, old, and catholic. You could count the surnames on one hand. If it wasn't for government assistance, the entire region would have collapsed decades ago.

Anyway... back to the school. We had *two* good teachers, both of whom had moved in from out of town, and both of whom have since left. One taught English, and the other taught advanced math and biology. English was a mandatory subject, and the large class sizes stopped teacher A from doing as much as she could. Teacher B, on the other hand, had a reputation for being demanding, so most students abandoned biology (which was an optional course) and chose the easier math course (taught, at the time, by a man who proselytized so convincingly about get-rich-quick investment schemes that he talked a close friend of mine into a series of disastrous life choices from which he has yet to fully recover. I hate the man.) All of this meant that, by the time I finally enrolled, teacher B's courses had only five students each.

His classes were amazing. In biology, we dissected eyes and lungs (lab work was unheard of in our school). His tests were phrased like medical exams: a patient complains of such and such a symptom, which organ is failing? In math, we had weekly challenge problems, which occasionally took pages of work to find a solution. My favourite involved the function (-2)^x , and served as a crash course to complex numbers. My second favourite had a typo, which lead me to learn about proof by induction because I wanted to show rigorously that the problem, as stated, was impossible. We also did projects, the most memorable of which involved using rudimentary calculus to optimize the shape of a boat, which we then built and loaded up with weight until it sank.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in mathematical biology. I owe him my life."

Don't be like many married men and cheat on your wife with men. Don't wait until you feel trapped and desperate. In my case I had dreams of having sex with other men to compensate for what I was missing. 

You need to talk to your wife. You need to explain to her why you didn't want to be gay. How you felt you could bury it and that it's not working. You need to be very honest and very contrite, you've not been honest with her and she deserves an apology. You say you haven't always known you were gay and I have to say I don't really believe you. In my case I knew I had been gay but I really convinced myself I could change that. It's not easy to admit you've made a mistake that has impacted other lives but to be honest with your family you need to be honest with yourself and I suspect you aren't there yet.

This will be painful for everyone but hopefully something can be worked out and whatever happens your son will love you. Be strong, be kind, be honest. I hope it goes as well as it possibly can."

I won't call it the ""best"" thing about being gay, but you barely have to convince men to have sex, while our straight male counterparts have to walk into a bar, buy a girl a few drinks, take her out to dinner, etc before she decides you've done enough work.

When you have two people equally driven to get off, the whole ""I don't want you to get the wrong idea bout me."" thing goes out the window. 

I realized this when I realized that there are not really cruising parks/bathouses for lesbians or straight men/women. Such a thing might require money to motivate the women into sex but for men, pure hormonal motivation. "

One of the chefs from the hotel was an older Muslim man. Very nice gentleman he would sometimes join us for lunch and he knew we were together, and it was always cute because if he wasn't there when I was he would always ask where my SO was. Around Thanksgiving last year my SO and his whole family got sick and all the stores were closed since it was Thanksgiving and I was having lunch with the chef that day and I was asking his advice of where I would be able to buy soup for my SO and his family. He just replied along the lines of saying that everything would be closed for the holidays, and right as I was walking out of the hotel from my shift he stops me and hands me this huge tub if home made chicken noodle soup.  He tells me that it is for my SO and his family and hopes that he gets better. That was probably one of the nicest most thoughtful gestures anyone has done for me and I was legit mind blown and extremely thankful.  Even though because his beliefs of my life were not exactly what I would consider idea; this man showed more empathy and compassion than most people I know.

Being a furry is more stigmatized than being gay (Luckily, it is so rare for people to know what a furry is so you rarely get people getting violent.) which means that a lot of gay guys will look at you with a very, very skeptical view. I'm not interested in fucking animals, or doing it in a fursuit, but I do enjoy the porn and obviously the toys from places like Bad Dragon.

If you refuse to provide a service to a gay man because of his sexuality, you’re saying his money has less value than that of a straight man. If you’re contributing to the same economy but you’re suffering because of factors beyond your control that, really, should have zero impact on your ability to earn and spend, then you are not an equal citizen.

I'm a man and I love cars and action movies and men's clothing. I also love Lady Gaga and Lana Del Rey and shopping and boys and gossiping...but I don't consider myself only 60% male because of that. I also have a male friend who is extremely flamboyant and loves wearing women's shirts (not a full crossdresser, just certain feminine items), but he also considers himself to be 100% male.

I don't understand why people have to say they're ""fluid"". I don't think me not liking sports makes me less of a man. I think the categories of ""male"" and ""female"" THEMSELVES should be expanded, so that even a man who hates sports and carries a purse is still considered a man, and even a woman who likes wearing flannels and playing sports is still considered a woman. Gender is a construct and is totally arbitrary, but I still see no need to create new labels.

At the same time, to each his own. If my friend, for example, said that he didn't feel comfortable saying he was a man, I would respect that. I just don't understand the need for it."
248,"The Netherlands has achieved a point where smaller cities seem to be more accepting towards gays than big cities (for demographic reasons).

Ignoring the Bible Belt, that is."
249,Yes.

251,"Who knows what would happen but what I do know is that HIV doesn't care what health plan is active right now.  If you are sexually active, it is best to protect yourself as much as you can.  That is the price of admission in having sex in a relatively safe manner.  I can probably make a similar argument you are making if I contracted a STD or STI.  When does it end and begin?  I personally wouldn't risk it."
252,"We're a minority and unless we voluntarily get ourselves surrounded by gay guys, we're bound to actually have more straight friends (female, male) than the opposite... And it's not uncommon for gay guys to befriend other guys... Because we're also guys and we often share common interests.

Thus, attraction can happen, just like you befriending a girl. The gay guy notice how of an awesome package his straight friend is, doesn't have the equivalent in his gay life. It's normal, after all, we all want to date someone we can be a really good friend with to an extend and it's hard to find that in the wild.

And then, the spiral begins. You're straight (I think?), he's gay. Nothing will ever happen (afaik). So he start to repress his feelings. He fight them. But they only get stronger and stronger and stronger to a point it becomes overwhelming and that's where your story occurs. You're his friend, he doesn't want to lose you, but he's conflicted with his own feelings. What might have happened is that it was obviously too overwhelming for him so he got all of it out, but then freaked out about your potential reaction because it's also common knowledge that revealing your feelings to your straight male friend often cause awkwardness or ruin the friendship.

Basically he emptied his bag on you but didn't want to deal with the possible consequences. He will talk about it if he feels the need but just... remind him you're his friend no matter what."
253,You are fake news
254,"On the plus side, one of his regrets in his life when it comes to an end will be ""I didn't attend my son's wedding"" not ""my son didn't even invite me to his wedding."""
