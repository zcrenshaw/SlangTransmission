14,"I was on a packed subway train after school one day and somebody got on and pressed right up behind me. This is normal in NYC, but after about 30 sec or so I felt a definite boner up against my ass. I was facing a door I was easily able to see his reflection. Because he was actually hot and my age, I took every opportunity to bump and grind back against him. I even ""fell"" back against him during one lurch of the train so that he would have to catch me. He was smiling and hard the entire time. The train got to my stop and as I walked out the door he did too! I stopped and got a good look at him: flimsy running shorts, track shirt, duffel bag. He looked at me and asked ""Do you have time to hang out?"" We were two blocks from my apartment, my mom was on a work trip, and my dad would not be home for hours. Yes, I got to fully experience what had been poking me on the train that afternoon!"

27,:) This is the most touching thing I've read/heard in a while.
28,That's actually so true. Sometimes I feel like a whole different person after masturbating.
29,"If I think back, and this was well before sixth grade, my family lived in California. My mom's closest friend had two sons. I was enamored with the oldest, we'll call him Alex. He was a couple years older than me. And whenever we had a chance to hang out, we were in our own world. I can't remember having more fun with anyone in my life until I met my ex.

But there was one time we went to the beach. I wasn't in the mood to go, and I don't think Alex was either. Me, him, my sister, and his brother were all pretty sandwiched into the backseat of the car. I sat pressed against him the whole time, and he spent most of the ride staring out the window with the occasional look over at me. I remember being really happy about that. It was cold, we were both freezing, but I was really at some sort of peace over that. We got to the beach. Alex and I weren't really in the mood for it, so we ended up walking off and over to this alcove. He threw a bunch of rocks and I was just... there. I sucked at skipping rocks, so I gave up after my first one failed. There wasn't much of anything said between us. But I remember us both being in a relatively good mood over there. A little while later, we packed up and left. But I was really sad when we dropped them off because I couldn't sit next to him anymore.

In 2000, we visited California. His mom was deathly ill, and it later turned out to be the last time my mom got to see her best friend. She passed away several months later. It had been some time since we had last seen each other. He came into the bedroom, told me I was welcome to sit on his bed, and then he laid himself out. I was crushed between the wall and him, with about half of me under this teenager, who lay there making various animal noises at me. Eventually that just turned into laying there, nothing to say, him still practically on top of me, and I had absolutely no complaints. I was just happy to be where I was at that moment. It didn't even phase me that it would be the last time I'd ever see him.

After several years of digging around, I managed to find the younger brother. He's done amazing, gone places and become someone. But Alex had practically dropped contact with everyone. He got a job as soon as he could, moved out of their dad's place and never looked back. Didn't call anyone, didn't want to be found. So, I have no real clue how he's doing, why he suddenly dropped everyone. I knew their father's side of the family was abusive. When my family still lived in California and I saw him more often, Alex mentioned that he hated his dad a lot. I never heard that out of his brother though. 

I don't know if Alex turned out to be gay. His brother has no clue what he's doing or where he lives. I guess he tried to make contact a couple times and just got a ""I'm fine, bro"" response. I know I had a really unique relationship with Alex. Compared to other boys I had as good friends, Alex was the only one that both made a lot of physical contact with me when we were around each other and also was perfectly fine with us doing and saying absolutely nothing together. Most of my time around him was spent in dead silence. He's the only person I've managed that with in my lifetime. I could say I loved my ex (as an adult) as much as I loved Alex (as a kid), but I never had the kind of relationship with my ex where we could spend hours doing nothing or saying nothing while we were around each other.

Anyway, I look back at how I felt about Alex as a kid and, had I known what sex or romance was, I would call everything about him my a-ha! moment. I still carry those memories with me. I will probably never get a chance to see him again, but I hope he has a fulfilling life."

45,"I'm sure I'll get flack for this, but I think you should just swallow your pride and meet with him. You can't just paint people in a monolith and assume they are all one way. Keep an open mind, maybe his reason for supporting Trump is something you've never heard before.

There's an old rule that a gentleman never discusses politics, religion, or sex. The first two apply to young relationships as well.
"
46,"Are u a guy or girl? 

I think u should just sit down with him and just let him know how much you love him and that you're there for him whenever he needs you. And then smile and give him a hug. Just make it more comfortable for him to get closer to you should he want to. 

That's what I do when I want to tell people that I know their secret without telling them directly that I know their secret. I just take them out one day and hang out with them and we'll take a drive around and immediately after they start opening up. Works every time. "

&gt; I also have a another question. What are the best ways for me to show him that I trust him completely? I mean I've told him that I trust him but I want him to get the feeling through my actions too.

94,"I'd thread carefully with him. I'm bisexual and I love having sex with men. Similar issue with wife not having sex etc. However, I'd be uncomfortable with my kids coming to me and ""outing"" me if you will. I'd feel I failed in hiding it well.

I was raised catholic like him and I guess he has been fed a lot of guilt (one of the reasons I left it behind) about your sexuality and being a devout he probably has challenges reconciling his upbringing with his desire to be intimate with a man.

I found out about men after I was married for a long time and in a sense I wish I had learned that before getting married (still love my wife but sex is a different issue). 

He seems to be happy with his companion. I'd just give him space. He may feel self conscious and just stop the relationship altogether to prove he's not gay, which may even be worse.

121,"Ireland checking in here. Our attitude to the LGBT community is defined very strongly by the fact that the LGBT people here are our brothers, sisters, daughters, sons and sometimes mothers and fathers. We had the strong institutional discrimination that was promoted by the church but the fact remained the same that any time anyone injured a gay man or woman, or said something shitty to them, or looked on them as less, that could have been my neighbour, friend or family member. But that's gone now, even in the rural community that I live in.

I'm a straight man yet some of the people I grew up with who were gay just ended up in love with other people who were gay and it was never really a thing. It's just not a thing here at all really and when I look at the discrimination around the world I just don't understand it, and I don't know anyone who does. 

This youth initiative is meant to divert young people from the headlines on the Internet and in to their local community in the hope that they will not internalise the hatred that's so easy to find on the Internet. It's meant to empower them to live with pride and joy and to value themselves as whole people. I mean it's about love, and that can't be a bad thing. I love you guys, all of you. "
122,"I'm not sure if this is rhetorical or not but I'll try to answer. 

Anyway, it depends on your world view. Most today go by the ""harm principle"" - meaning, if it's not harming anybody else, it's okay. 

But some people think certain values/morals should be universalized regardless of whether or not there's a tangible harm. Not everyone believes it's wrong to impose certain value systems on others. 

A lot of it has to do with religion, too. Believing in a higher power, moral law, natural order, etc. 

That's the most sense I can make of it. "

At least gummybear and hushhush gave very warm advice and I'm happy to see they've got by far the most upvotes so that kind of weighs out the rest, but still.

I can't tell you how to do it but you definitely need to tell him exactly what you wrote. You're a very great kid and your father can be proud of you. I didn't see any anger towards him. I can't say if I could be this loving.

The other things that might be done about the situation can be considered and followed later.

I remember the day he asked, ""How is Tom doing?""  Sounds trivial but it was an acknowledgement that Tom was part of my life.  Dad and I disagreed about a lot of things.  I was a radical, he a conservative Democrat.  He got a lot more liberal the older he got.  

Stocks were the area where we connected.  He would call me up and ask, ""what do you think about ADM, should I buy it?""  I don't know if he ever followed my advice but that he asked meant a lot to me.

I can't deal with a Trump supporter:  that is, someone who thinks, especially after he actually took office and started acting as president that Loofah Faced Shitgibbon is a strong, wonderful leader, and that the Republican economic and foreign policies will lead us all to a safe, glorious future where America is made great again and we are all equal because of the glory of Trump"

163,He's protecting you from them. He knows they are toxic. He even gravitates toward your family situation which is much more tolerant and healthy. And by all accounts he's doing everything right relationship wise. Look toward that and what can be and not what can't be. He is. 
164,Over the past year two straight friends (who don't know each other) have told me they fantasise about having a 'gay lifestyle' - which in their heads is no kids/no resposibilities/double income/lots of sex. It was obviously something they have thought about so maybe they talk about that. (These guys both have kids!)
165,I dated a guy that had his apartment filled with German Nazi military memorabilia including two mannequins that were fully dressed in military uniform with gas masks on. He had me dress up in full uniform and play the part of him being the enemy.. It was fun but weird. The worst part is that I dated him for a few months...  This was 30 years ago. 
166,"Bro, you need some cuddling and tickling. 

You need to be running full bore through the house trying to outrun a water balloon while laughing, screaming and wearing (almost) no clothes. 

Sex for sex sake is whatever bro. Come sit on papa's lap and tell me all about it. We can hug it out and you will feel like you are important....because you fucking are. 

This movie....only has ONE Leading man....You are it babe...so Get up, go find someone to make you feel better, and demand your sex come with some fucking strings. It isn't supposed to be just XXX. "

172,"I think most people dont mean it in a mean way. In our dorm we have an Alice and shes my Chinese friend. Why Chinese friend? Because shes the only Chinese friend I have. And there are multiple Alices. I could care less about her nationality but in this setting, she is an extreme minority. It wouldn't be proper to call a black friend of mine my black friend because I have multiple black friends and there are plenty of black people around. 

We never reduce Alice to her ethnic background in any other way besides how we describe her. In fact I always forget that shes actually straight from China, I keep thinking that shes an immigrant whose been here for a while. 

If ur friends keep bringing up ur gayness that is a problem. You are more than ur preferences. Thats when they reduce u to ur sexuality. But if its just how they call you and it doesn't go beyond anything else, I think you should try to be less sensitive. Unless u have a problem with random people knowing you are gay, then ur friend definitely should respect that. "

Furthermore it's all about intention  for me, call me a fag as long as you aren't attacking me, I'm good, I could call you toast and make it sound more rude than calling you gay, it's all about intentions, so dont get hung up on being labeled gay, at the end of the day it's who you are so don't get mad when people remember you by it.

193,No need to be a cunt. 
194,"I have this whole routine I do whenever I can't contain myself when I visit or he visits.

I get close to him but not too close. At this point, he's either confused or really riled up. I lean in and peck at his neck a little before lightly reaching up his shirt, then I walk away.

Within moments, he transforms into this unstoppable sex monster. Literally, he'll lift me up from where I'm sitting and carry me to bed to make me his. 

Conversely, he gets me wild whenever he subtly grabs me in public. We went to a family gathering and I had to excuse myself for a moment after we posed for a group photo because he used the moment to sneak a booty grab mid-picture. 

Once, I almost slipped and fell and he caught me by one of my belt loops like Spider-Man. I would have let him raw me right there and then if we weren't at the groceries."

197,"The stereotype that we're all dom tops because we've all got a fair bit of self-loathing and internalized homophobic so we won't ever bottom. I've sadly met a lot of middle eastern guys who think this way, and who also think being a complete asshole is ""dom"" (it isn't).

I briefly removed the little down arrow from my Grindr profile and every bottom on my college campus started messaging me. Repeatedly hearing something to the effect of ""omggg middle easterns are like my fav haha"" gets annoying when they're all obviously operating under the assumption of that stereotype."

199,"This sub's goon squad is probably going to blame you and act like you have ""internalized homophobia"" or some other nonsense. If they do I'm preemptively suggesting you ignore them. 

Anyway.. I read this over a few times and honestly I think you're in a really tough spot because sexual attraction is so important. I was in a similar situation to this some years ago (although the relationship was nowhere near this serious), where a guy I was seeing sort of changed in a drastic way like this and it ultimately killed the relationship because I wasn't digging being with a brand new person who I wasn't attracted to inhabiting the old one's body. To start with I'd probably suggest casually mentioning it, like saying ""Hey I noticed since your mother came to stay you seem a little different, is everything alright?"" and see what happens and go from there. 

Do not take this problem lightly though - I think it's potentially more severe than you currently know because bedroom death is one of the biggest relationship killers there is and can't be allowed to to exist for long or it's going to fester. Also, at the risk of seeming a bit insensitive issues like this are the type of things you should and need to be able to discuss with your man, and if you can't your relationship might be in a worse spot than you think.

Goodluck"
200,"Yeah, you need to use your presence in their lives as leverage to make them stop saying shitty things to you. 

They've had several years to get their act together. Send them a link to a local PFLAG chapter. Next time they bust out this homophobic shit, explain that you will not be treated like this and just get up and leave. "
201,"The first time I met my BF's roommate is when she and her friend walk in on me naked on their sofa right after I met them. FML. The were supposed to be out of town but their plans got changed.

And once when we first started dating we were at my place while my roommate (who I wasn't out to) walked in on us in boxers snuggling and watching TV. That fucker was supposed to be out of town too."

204,Yep absolutely agree with you. It's a part of me it's not what defines me. I have a few gay friends who only hang out with other gay people and that's all they talk about or do. I personally feel it's unhealthy to just surround yourself like that. They are almost afraid to talk to straight guys or get easily butt hurt when someone says something they don't like. Idk to me it's not realistic to be wrapped up in your comfort zone or bubble like that. Just my two cents...

Leap for joy, message back and hookup (although that didn't end well). I told him buddy sorry but you kinda deserve it - he was flat out racist and you still gave him a second chance.

235,"I'll be a contrary voice, I guess.

James was decidedly not interested in you when you were single and professing your love.  Now you're in a relatively long-term relationship (at least for guys your age) with a guy you can see a future with and James suddenly loves you?  Honestly, it sounds like you're his back-up if nothing better comes a long and now that he's realizing you can find love elsewhere, he wants to break you and your boyfriend up so you'll still be there for him.  

What is going to happen someday when a hotter guy comes along who James doesn't see as a brother?  Seems pretty easy for James to pull the same shit again:  Sorry man, I do love you but you're still like a brother to me.

My advice is to tell James you're in a relationship and you're going to let that relationship run its course. If it ends up not working out, you'd be willing to explore possibilities with him at that time.  But don't throw away a healthy relationship."

If I were you OP, I would call the police (using your local non-emergency number) and file a report as well as go to ER immediately and get **PEP** and a rape kit.

You've already showered, which unfortunately removes most of the evidence, but there's still a chance. It's still worth filing the report.

In any case, I'm sorry that this happened to you OP. I strongly recommend that no matter what you choose to do here, you should also elect to take a few therapy sessions, as this kind of thing will likely eat away at you, and it can help a lot to speak to a professional.
