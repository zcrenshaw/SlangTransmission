1,"I live in Canada and we have the most generous refugee policy for gays whose lives are threatened. I have friends who demonstrated their lives were in danger and were harmed from Kazakhstan, Columbia and and admitted as refugee.

You are a young man and living in fear and secrecy for many years to come would be hard. "
2,"when he's gone, you need to pack up your things and leave, immediately. You are in a dangerous place, and it will only get worse. Next time you talk to him, hide your phone and record him, if its legal to do so in your location. And, if need be, fight back. Pack up, leave when he's not home, leave no trace of where you are going. If the police ever do come looking, let them know that your BF's family has video evidence of your boyfriend hitting you. As for rape charges, they will find nothing. They will do a Sex Assault kit, and when they find no fluids or penetration, they cant prosecute. I doubt itll come to that. The main thing is to leave, get in contact with someone, ANYONE that isn't tied to your BF. please stay safe, PM me if you need to"
3,"You're still a hero. You wanted it and you tried. You took the challange. You had balls, unlike so many people, gay or straight.

I salute you with great respect. (｀-´)&gt;"
4,"I mean this a shitpost, but yeah everything happening to that assclown is pretty great."
5,"because it makes for a better plot than sitting on Grindr for an hour, giving up, and jerking off."
6,"That's 100% cultural. I personally don't feel any kind of disgust when looking at a naked woman; it's like looking at a cow or any other organism that I'm not attracted too. Interesting, a bit alien but not repulsive. "
7,This entire post cured my depression. 
8,"It's funny how every time any kind of disenfranchised or marginalized group of people get recognized in film, people suddenly say it's just the ""trend to be __"" 

People are shitty, that'll never change. Luckily we are still fabulous *and* have a best picture oscar now. So we got that going for us :)"
9,"BLM has no place dictating who can or cannot be part of Pride. It is not their event, it is the LGBT community's event. It's no secret that police were involved in the arrest of many members of the LGBT community in the 70s and 80s through raids in nightclubs and so on, but that is in the past and having the police actively participate in Pride parades shows how much LGBT rights issues have evolved in our society. 

This is not a case of PoC feeling uncomfortable having police participating in Pride parade, it was never an issue in the past, still isn't an issue. This is solely BLM's personal war on cops at works and an incredible overreach on their part to try and hijack other events. Police officers, and especially LGBT police officers have every rights to attend and participate in the parade. BLM can go jump off a bridge if they are not happy. 

Which isn't to say that BLM doesn't have some valid points against Pride organizers (like a lack of representation of minorities), but hijacking a fun joyous event is not the way to go about it, they have to sit down with the Pride organizers and make their cases, make suggestions, etc. but leave the police out of this."
10,"&gt; I suggested he date someone below him in looks to decrease the odds of getting cheated on. He nodded in agreement, and the next day he asked me out!

Had me on the floor lool 😂😂😂"
11,"Ultimately I think this is good news and you can take it at face value. It probably wouldn't hurt to give it a little more time so that he can adjust. How much is hard to say, I suppose that will depend on how persistent he is about wanting this meeting to occur. 

Despite your dad's homophobia in the past and the difficulty he's had accepting you, I think the fact that he wants to meet your boyfriend shows that he's genuinely trying. Give him a lot of credit for that. It won't be perfect for sure. There will be bumps. You need to set clear expectations of his behavior before the meeting, and be clear about what sorts of things will be grounds for you and your boyfriend to leave. Make sure you have a way to do so if the meeting gets ugly. 

If the meeting goes badly, don't give up n your dad. A lot of people are afraid of what they don't know or understand, and it's only by exposure that they gradually come to learn that we're all the same. It sounds to me like there is some real hope that, in time, your dad will come to accept you. "
12,"First of all, we didn't get gay rights.  We got the right to marry our partners.   And if he drops you off at work and the two of you kiss, in 27 states you can get fired.  That isn't gay rights.

I looked on in bewilderment as younger gays and some older celebrated our ""equality"" when the Supremes legalized gay marriage.  Sorry Charley, the celebration is premature.  Hatred didn't end, legal discrimination didn't end, religious intolerance didn't end.  

When we were marching for ""gay rights"" in 1972, marriage wasn't even one of them.  Equal employment, equal access to housing, equal treatment by the guvment were the rights we were after.  Along came gay marriage and everyone is like ""we won, we're equal"".  Nope we aren't and under Trump some of those gains are going to be eaten away by ""states rights"" and ""bathroom bills"" which universally include language prohibiting cities from enforcing anti-gay discrimination laws.

So why would gay marriage end gay loneliness?  It isn't equal rights.   It doesn't stop the hate, the derision, the violence, the conversion therapies.  It doesn't stop parents from throwing out young gay kids who come out.  Yes it was a victory, a change for the better but to think that the struggle is over is naïve.  

In fact, since the election I have been to 6 demonstrations, 2 of them, gay ones.  That is more than I have been to in the past decade.  Won't you join me?"
13,"I wrote the most beautiful story but I had to change the pronouns from ""him"" to ""her"".

It got featured on an indie blog but I despised it. "
14,"When women think that they can make me do something by seducing me.

I always fight the desire to say ""bitch, your shit doesn't work on me""."
15,"All things aside, how was the taco?"
16,Damn you and your fancy emotiwords! 
17,"You know what happened. He hit you because you didnt want to have sex with him. Im gonna say that again. He fucking hit you because you wouldnt have sex with him! Please get away from him. It all starts somewhere and i dint want to read a post from you in a year or 2 about how hes beating you regularly but swears he will change.
Tell a close friend what happened, they will tell you the same.

I hope things get better for you x"
18,"Well that was depressing.

I think it's also because gay guys have a hard time distinguishing friends from sex partners. The line gets blurred way too often. Also, because everyone is always looking for the next best thing. No one wants to settle. Obviously I'm making very broad generalizations."
19,"Seriously. Before this week, I had no idea who this guy even is. And after I found out, I still don't care.

Guys. Let's stop making stupid people famous."
20,"Growing up, Christmas was a big deal in my family. We'd have a party two weeks before Christmas and Christmas day was a huge deal with family and friends.

The days before the first Christmas my bf and I were together I was kind of sad since I'd had to stop talking to my relatives and it was just him and me. I was glad to be with him but it wasn't what I was used to. On Christmas day I awoke to my phone ringing and it was him asking me if I was awake yet. I got out of bed and walked around the apartment and was like, ""Where the hell are you?"" He said he was at the store getting a few things. I asked what store, it was Christmas, no one was open. He said 7-11. He told me to take a quick shower and get dressed. So I showered, put on some coffee, and called him and almost immediately there was a knock on the front door.

I opened the door and there was Santa! The ""Ho, ho, ho, Merrrrry Christmas"" and everything! I almost fell apart right there. I let Santa in, he leaned in and gave me a kiss, then sat down and invited me to sit on his lap. He told me he dressed up while I was asleep and had been sitting out in the car the whole time.

We opened presents, had coffee spiked with tequila, listened to Christmas music, and I got to slow dance with Santa to ""White Christmas!"" It ended up being a perfect Christmas day and I ""thanked"" Santa very, very much that afternoon."
21,He doesn't deserve anything better than shitposts. 
22,I usually slip into the conversation that I don't ever want to have kids. 9 times out of 10 that will deflect them. 
23,"No, but never feel shamed.  You're protecting yourself from a disease you do not wish to contract.  You're making a health decision for you.  You are your only true protector, and in that situation your choice alone is paramount to anything else."

25,"I can't wait for the eventual ""the hooker I fell in love with refuses to date me! Help! :("" post"
26,"""Her"" beautiful muscular hairy arms and those big meaty hairy legs"
27,"&gt;Pidgeotto look

Oh my god "
28,"Yiannopoulos took to his Facebook page Sunday night to say, ""I do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a coordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject.""



My god this keeps getting better and better lmao."
29,"It's more about American culture being based on stupid religious bullshit

Forget which one, but one older culture had naked male marble statues everywhere. They appreciated male beauty (greece?) Idk"
30,"Nah, you're going to meet him. He messaged you and you're going to be confident in your small town personality and demeanor. You're not going to be awkward because you're going to be confident.


Good luck"
31,"Im poz.  Tell them to go fuck themselves.

Are they nuts?  Thats the height of entitlement, expecting you to let them expose you to infection.

Dont be shamed.  There are guys who will have sex with them."
32,YOUR PELVIC WITCHERY DOES NOT AFFECT ME!
33,"When a guy doesn't know I'm gay and he's like dude, check her out... When I was checking out the guy next to her, actually  "
34,"Make him say again that he is going to lie about raping him and record that. Yes, you won't be able to use it in courtroom but it'll probably keep your psycho boyfriend away."
35,"Straight guy here. I'm not grossed out by my own body. There are things I don't love about it, just like ever other person. I have no issues with other naked men. I work out six days a week, and see it all the time. I'm very secure in my masculinity. I think most people who show such distain, have deep insecurities. They tend to project them on others, Or there just ignorant dicks."
36,Tell her you're gay 🙄
37,"The dealbreaker part for me would be having unprotected sex with you before telling you, even just once. I see in one of your comments that he did. That's a pretty major violation.

I could forgive the rest, but not that."
38,"I'm so glad you're realising all of these things are horrifyingly abusive, though I'm sorry you had to go through it.

I personally think people who repeatedly make bad choices and deliberately harm other people *are* bad people.

Thank fuck you left; you're well out of that relationship."
39,I ***demand*** an update after friday night! Good luck and have fun!
40,"These situations are seldom black and white. There is a lot of grey to it and that can cloud the issue for some men. 

The issue is ""will it continue?"" The reality is that he drinks, and he is abusive when he drinks some of the time. 

This relationship is not safe. Let's recap the facts. He hit you, He denied it, you cuddled (made up) afterward, and now he disputes that it ever happened. This particular event didn't leave a scar or a broken bone, but depending on his actions, this can escalate."
41,I had a cop friend of mine that handcuffed me when we were messing around once.
42,Figuring out all these new ways to turn down all. this. pussy. 
43,"I remember almost hitting it off with this guy who wasn't exactly attractive, and I didn't give a shit 'cause he was nice and interesting but then he started bombarding me about dick questions and shit saying that he might not satisfy me in bed and stuff 'cause he has a small dick. Went downhill from there 'cause he wouldn't stop talking about it. I didn't even care about his dick size yet he never got past looking at me like I'm some lunatic who's gonna laugh at someone for having a small dick. Don't end up like him.

You aren't your penis. Your penis doesn't encompass your whole existence. You didn't just go through your life just to throw it away because of your dick. There are gay men with severe disabilities that their last hope of getting a relationship is with someone who's willing to make the sacrifice for them and yet most of them are in relationships.

Sex is important but not every relationship thrives on it and not everyone is after sex. Haven't you read those reddit posts about 'bla bla why is everyone after sex Bla bla'."
44,There are no straight guys here.
45,When friends try and set me up with girls
46,"Yeah, as a Latino American, I would get guys (mostly white) starting conversations like ""hey papi""... no thanks 👋🏽"
47,"No thanks. As long as you're voting for right wing politicians you're contributing to the problem. 

Look at Log Cabin Republicans, the rest of the party shunned them from major Conservative events. "
48,"Yes, pretty much entirely. I can't even fantasize about other people in my dreams anymore. I had a dream where I turned down sex from Chris Evans because he wasn't my husband.
"
49,What do you mean I can't wear the same rotation of a half dozen pairs of jeans and hooded sweatshirts everyday.  What else does a guy need?
50,Tell her you don't like giving women orgasms because they become too clingy. 
51,Some people are super cheesy cause they think it's funny. I've done this myself. 
52,i take dumps larger and more violent than my boyfriends penis so i'm sure you'll be fine 
53,HOW BOUT DAHT
54,"Naked pics online? That's disgusting. On a website? There's so many of them though. Where? Which one?
"
55,"Once we were watching porn and every single interracial porn had the word ""thug"", ""gangstaboi"" in it or something equivalent. We are an interracial couple and suddenly he says (as a joke) ""I want your big black cock to fuck my white ass raw, gangstaboi"" in the most monotone voice ever 

Okay, this is funnier if you were there to hear him say it. I laughed way too hard"
56,"And now I'm sad.

At least you tried OP. Don't let this discourage you. You're doing better than all the people who don't have the cojones to ask their crush out. "
57,Well... shit. Hugs from Sweden dude. 
58,"Call me naive but I didn't realise there was a big problem with police led racial violence in Canada too? I thought BLM was mainly in the US? 

Looks like BLM see Pride as an easy target, and it looks like they were right about that too.

Side note, what is ""two-spirited""?"
59,"They are envious and under the illusion that they are somehow entitled to the spoils of your husband's hard work. Sounds like he has tried to help them out in the past and they took it for granted.  
  
I would talk to your husband about it. Plain and simple. Not to tell him that you don't want his family in your house, but explain to him how they make you feel and go from there."
60,/r/gaystoriesgonewild
61,The whole point of police marching in pride is for them to show solidarity with us though. The thing I don't like about identity politics is the goddamn cliqueyness.

r/absolutelynotmeirl"
63,"This needs to be higher. There are also LGBT organizations that will help privately sponsor gay refugees. Considering OP can speak English, that would help in his application. "
64,"said this before and i'll say it again...what's amazing to me is that a certain segment of the lgbt *seriously* think they're with allies in that sub. /r/the_donald and /r/rightwinglgbt literally use the word ""faggot"" as a term of endearment for gay people and those gay dudes swallow it up and ask for more.  
  
also, you hit the nail on the head. /r/rightwinglgbt is ran and populated by /r/the_donald trolls who give zero fucks about real lgbt issues. they're only there to sway the less intelligent members of the lgbt to actively cheer and vote against their own interests.  "
65,Heterosexuality. It's going to be a tough one. 
66,Thanks for these. I'll try them out.
67,"Same, even full blown lesbian sex doesn't gross me out or anything, it just doesn't do anything for me."
68,Tbh any guy breathing next to me is enough to melt my heart.
69,Seriously. Fuck him. I think one of the things I hate the most is minorities who gain fame by belittling the group they are a part of. It's so easy to do because whether it's racists or homophobes they will all eat that shit up and make the person their poster boy. I hope he never recovers from this.
70,"&gt; but I don't have bruises so I might be overreacting

Is that the metric you want to be using? ""It's ok as  long as there's no physical evidence left""?"
71,"I honestly think it's because these kinds of guys are just so afraid of being perceived as ""gay"" that they make a huge deal out of expressing how totally 100% NO HOMO they are. That includes acting with disgust when they see a naked guy. I doubt they're actually disgusted, it's just insecurity. These are the same dudes who never touch their male friends and give those super awkward ""bro hugs"" and all."
72,People are reckless and stupid 
73,This single sentence describes the gay community better than anything else.
74,Shithole sub full of disgusting people. They can't even stand each other which is why they don't stay there and need to come here to spread their bullshit.
75,"Leave👏His👏Ass👏

Have👏A👏Fucking👏Backbone👏

Can't stay with a man presenting alternative facts. You don't need that shit. "
76,"You've got 3 huge red flags for abuse here.  

1) He's pressuring you for sex, when you don't want it.

2) He hit you.  It never starts as a beating, it starts with grabbing your arm, with shoving you, with hitting you while he's drunk.  This is a line I'm not sure you can uncross.

3) When confronted with having hit you, he didn't take responsibility, he didn't apologize, he shifted the blame onto you.  ""You're making it up."" ""You're the one who drinks too much."" ""You're just trying to make me feel guilty."" Next time, or maybe the time after that, it will be how it's your fault for provoking him.

Any of these, taken alone, is a good reason to leave someone.  Taken together, get the fuck out now."
77,"I've told them ""I'm saving myself for God.""

It's not my fault they don't know my boyfriend's nickname is ""God."""
78,"""You can put it in raw."""
79,"We were lying in bed, watching videos on YouTube and he said: I'm bored! He looked up a song by Selena Gomez and whatever masc he had went out the door when he stood up and started singing as though his life depended on it and dancing... I looked at him thinking: ""Is this real life?"", He looked at me and said: ""what? By the way, get your ass out of bed, I don't like dancing alone!""... So, yeah... we danced it out to Selena Gomez... Not my proudest moment, but 5/7 would do it again."
80,GOOD FOR YOU!!!!! Go Get em Tiger!!!
81,"Always found myself more attracted to guys with body hair than those without so, yes."
82,when mother talks about me marrying a girl
83,"Listen man, that certainly isn't a reason to kill yourself and I really hope you don't do that. Think about your family and loved ones. If someone has the audacity to laugh and make fun of you for that then they are not worth your time. You are more than your penis. You will find someone and don't let that hinder you from looking. If you need to talk send me a pm. Always willing to help someone in need especially since I've had family members take their lives. Chin up. "

85,"i dont care about the votes this will get: if you are HIV+ and you don't disclose that you are HIV+ no matter **how far along treatment you are** until after we fuck, i'm breaking up with you instantly. and it's your own damn fault.

health risk aside, lying about something so *absolutely important to tell the truth about* means there's an underlying level of dishonesty that i will never, ever be able to get over. i feel this is common sentiment"
86,I'm not sure who experienced the horror here 
87,"If someone tells me they're not into black guys I'm like, ""Whatever, next.""

I don't call them racist or anything because them not wanting to date or sleep with me doesn't make them racist."
88,"2nd boyfriend in 11th grade, meanwhile this person over 30 has barely had a relationship.

What a time to be alive."
89,"Hey, you had the balls to let him know you were interested in the first place. I tip my hat to you, good sir! 

Now I have all the inspiration I need to hit on the hunky McDonald's cashier. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
90,"Dominating the right guy as a top is so enjoyable for me. Nothing turns me on like taking advantage of cute and innocent looking guys who have self respect.  Making a guy feel completely conquered is so hot, even though I used to feel a bit weird about it afterwards.  When I started dating my boyfriend,  I tried to be more vanilla so I wouldn't scare him off. Eventually I realized he was a submissive boy and  wanted a real man in charge. Wish granted. :)"
91,"I doubt they're gone for good. Somebody probably downloaded them from wherever and reuploaded them on tumblr.

The ""good"" news is, there are so many reblog porn blogs and so, so, so many random selfies floating out there, that you're kind of lost in the crowd.

If you still have them, you could do a reverse image search and then use tumblr's abuse page to request a takedown, but that's a lot of work and may not be worth the trouble."
92,"Do you live with your folks? If not, the next time your mom asks a leading question like that, it may be time to let her know.

(Assuming you're in the West and your parents don't have a ten million dollar inheritance hanging over your head.)"
93,"You've gotta sit him down and tell him all this. Make him sit there and listen - don't let him respond until you're done. Acknowledge that he's trying to be helpful and you appreciate that, but, you've definitely got to stand up for yourself. Don't be afraid to validate his feelings - he's scared for you and wants to make sure you're ok, but, also be sure to tell him you can handle the world now..."

100,"That may have been her attempt to verify.

I was 42 when I told my mom.  I stopped by to do some damn thing and was talking and told her i was getting a divorce.  She asked ""is it another girl?""  I said no.  Then, way too quick, as I finished the ""no"", she asked ""another boy?"".  I just said yes.

My grand coming out."
101,"Toss him a towel, then get dressed and leave."
102,A half dozen pairs of jeans? Look at Mr. Moneybags over here...
103,"Talking with people was always a stuggle to me. I care way too much about if what I'm saying is entertaining or not. It always makes me give only a short responses or talk very quickly, just to get it over with.

But when I'm talking to my partner, he's always looking stright into my eyes, with a slight smile dancing on his lips and I can always tell that he's really interested in what I'm going to say. He never interrupts me, he always patiently allows me to end my sentence and he gives me the feeling like he would want me to talk even longer, because he's enjoying it."
104,"Just because legislation has passed doesn't mean society is suddenly fixed.  There are still rights issues, and a ton of push-back against LGBT rights and inclusion.  "
105,But don't you think its a little unfair that you reply back or speak with a guy only when you want to or are in the mood for it? Like what if the other person has been looking forward to hearing back from you but you only talk to them whenever you please?
106,"Three months seems too soon for him to have shared with you a signed and notarized list of all his kinks and fantasies.

Do you really think he's cheating just because he likes some out there porn?"
107,"Hairy butts, hairy legs, hairy forearms, hairy armpits, hairy chests, and hairy tummies."
108,"BLM is not really an organization in most traditional understandings of the word. It's more of a movement. They don't have leaders or hierarchies. Cherry picking the most extreme people and claiming they speak for the majority of BLM is not constructive. 

That said this pride thing is dumb imo. Let the police march. "
109,I can no longer tell the difference between a teenage boy and a lanky lesbian.
110,Company trip. Be a professional. Don't fuck up your professional relationships. 
111,"The straight guy banter. I hate having to partake in making lewd comments about scantily clad women in bars/clubs/etc. 

""Bro, check out the *tits* on that girl. I'd smash that so hard.""

""Yes. I, too, would smash that so hard."" 

It's probably just me, but it sucks. :(

112,He meant money. 
113,"Regular sexual encounters, only with use of penis or fingers? No.

Hardcore dildos, butt plugs or things like fisting? There is the danger."
114,"Go on the date anyway. Show you're interested, enjoy each other's company and simply don't let it get to the sexy time if that's the only problem. If he asks or seems disappointed, tell him that you're off your game sexually at the moment and are working on getting back to ready and that you definitely want to do that with him."
115,I don't like guys who are passive. I like guys who have passion and will argue their opinions.

118,It won't be easy. But I'm working hard towards it by taking a bunch of tests that will get me into an international university for graduate school. I have one year of college left here.
119,"You mean the hitler youth undercut? I don't mind it. But it's the nature of men's fashion that every damn trend looks identical with eachother. Like there's never any variation. 

I watched a video last year that was like ""upcoming 2016 men's hair trends"", and it was literally like 50 pomps."
120,"One day my mom sent me a homemade jam through my brother. My boyfriend was really hungry (we ordered pizza and they called us after 2 hours that the deliverer had car crash and they couldn't fulfill the order, sic!) and he wanted to try it.

Well, turned out officer Big Muscles couldn't get the jar open. I was watching him fighting the cap for like 10 mins. He sweat up, I could literally see the wet stains growing on his shirt on armpits. ""What the fuck. For fuck's sake, she closed it with dark magic or something?"", he said. (◔_◔)

I opened it with knife in five seconds. Never felt so resourceful in my whole life..."
121,"It isn't your responsibility, so what I say isn't to imply that. 

But, if you were her, how would you feel if your partner did this with someone who knew about you before they ever touched each other?

It's one thing if they have an agreement or open-marriage and he'd like to introduce you so you can see she's cool with it. This is something else altogether. 

Barring her being in a coma for 5 years and unable to respond, there's really no good reason he couldn't find a way to do this without being dishonest. (That doesn't mean it would be easy.)

There are LOTS of guys who want to have sex who aren't going to be doing it behind someone else's back. 

If you do it, don't ever bitch and moan if someone does it to you. Not a single word."
122,Yeah but the effect wears off in like 15 minutes.
123,"Sorry, the Golden Girls is non-negotiable.

124,"The far right made him famous, because they gave him a platform to spew his bullshit all over national media."
125,"No it's not fair at all, BLM is a disgrace of an organization, footage from their marches show them to be chanting ""All white police must die"" ""fuck white people"" and screaming ""She's white get her!"" before attacking an innocent white women due to the colour of her skin, if you have any sort of sympathy for an organisation like that you are an idiot."

But half the time they're actively looking 

*Happily married = want sex, but I'm married and can't leave my SO for you

*Not looking to hookup= convince me  "
134,Hmm I've never wondered if Santa was a bottom before...
135,No but he cums in me. I don't really feel much beyond his throbbing but just the idea of being bred is so hot. Like my body made him orgasm and his cum is my reward... I get hard thinking about it through out the day.

139,"I don't think it's that bad. If I were in your shoes, I would probably avoid bringing it up. He knows you were drunk. If he still shows interest in you, go with it and let him make the first move as far taking your relationship to the next level. "

Idk how bad your case is, but I'd honestly try and tough it out.  I've gone on dates with swamp-ass before.  It's not the worse thing ever.  It honestly is a pretty weak excuse to cancel a date IMO.  "
144,"&gt;From article: *In interviews that Elder, the post-traumatic stress researcher, conducted with 20 gay men in 2015, he found that 90 percent said they wanted a partner who was tall, young, white, muscular and masculine. For the vast majority of us who barely meet one of those criteria, much less all five, the hookup apps merely provide an efficient way to feel ugly.*

&gt;*“For gay people, we’ve always told ourselves that when the AIDS epidemic was over we’d be fine. Then it was, when we can get married we’ll be fine. Now it’s, when the bullying stops we’ll be fine. We keep waiting for the moment when we feel like we’re not different from other people. But the fact is, we are different. It’s about time we accept that and work with it.”*

That was a good article. Thanks for posting it."

153,"Clinginess is the biggest one for me. I need a lot of space and alone time and I absolutely can't stand guys who want to talk all the time and get upset when I'm busy with something else. I also can't stand guys who feel they're entitled to my free time and get mad at me if I don't feel like going out/seeing them on the weekend or something. ""Would you rather be alone than spend time with me?"" yes, yes sometimes I would, because being alone is not unpleasant. I legitimately enjoy it.

I think it's because to me it's an indication of either a lack of trust in me or a particular kind of low self-esteem that I personally don't like to have to deal with. Like if a guy is self-conscious about his appearance that's ok, most of us are in one way or another, but if his sense of self-worth depends on how much time/attention he gets from other people, I'm out. "
154,"He looked after me in the hospital when I was hospitalized. Helped me go to the bathroom,buy me food,even spoonfeeding me, even though he had school(He's in electrical Engineering and his course load is not easy to say the least). He went to tend to me after class for the 2 weeks I was hospitalized. And he was like"" hey if ENGG doesn't work out,maybe I can switch to Nursing"".

Then he was like ""after you get better you better pay up
for my services by letting me fuck you every night for
2 weeks"". I know it was a joke but I was more than willing to oblige ;)"
155,"Nah, what you said is kind of true from what I've noticed. Gay men aren't the norm and since there's so little of us, it makes it hard to try to form lasting relationships what with the lines being blurred between friends and sex partners. ""FWB"" or ""Fuck Buddy"" is like the mantra for gay ""friends"" it seems (I'm not saying all but a good chunk). 

Hetero people do this too but not in seemingly large numbers because there is PLENTY to choose from and they get to experience intimacy/relationships earlier than gay men usually do."
156,"I'm half Asian, half white (just a disclaimer), so I have some license to speak on this. It's because Asian culture (at least East Asian, with Koreans, Japanese and Chinese) is far more conservative than Western culture is. It's much more difficult to come out for Asian Americans because bottom line, you're more likely to be shunned, screamed at by your parents for failing them and for dishonoring the whole family (collectivist culture), are more likely to be pressured into marrying, etc. Why do you think the vast majority of gay people in Korea and China at least marry someone of the opposite gender? Because if they don't conform and have kids like their parents expect them do (i.e. the pressure of having children, etc), they'll be shunned by all of society and their family will be ridiculed. So many guys in Korea have wives and kids, then go to the bathhouses. And there is the matter of arranged marriages, at least in the past. Homosexuality was seen as a Western concept, and individuality was (and still is) frowned upon.

The bottom line is, they were no where close to being as visible, and they still aren't.

Lastly, look up Ivory Aquino... she's a Filipina trans actress who's playing a role in the series."

159,"Dickless trans guy here. Absolutely not transphobia. You will probably hear from some people that it is, but that's a ridiculous statement; transphobia is people telling us we can't shit in their bathrooms, denying us rights and disrespecting us. 

Just be respectful and explain to him that you're a bottom and you're not really into using strap-ons, so you don't think it'll work out. 

As a side note, he should have told you sooner. Was always one of the first things out of my mouth when I was single. Saves everyone a lot of awkwardness and grief."

164,"It was actually the first time we messed around. I went over to his place and he likes to goof around a lot and so he ends up slapping the cuffs on me with my hands behind my back. Well, eventually I told him I thought it was kinda hot that he had me handcuffed on his bed. 

Well, one thing led to another and we ends up taking my pants off and banging me with the cuffs still on. We messed around a few times after that and I believe he cuffed me one other time."

167,"Obligatory ""str8"" guy story 

Had a fucking hot straight roommate who I had a super mega crush on for basically forever. He had a girlfriend and stuff and I never got even an inkling that he might be bi or whatever. Well one night he and i and my best friend all popped a fuck ton of adderall and went to the gay club lol. Had a good time there, met some new people who were also up, when the place closed we were all gonna go back to our place to stay up. He was riding with me and while we're in the car he starts talking about how he liked the attention he got from guys in the club and how horny it made him. Dude just whips out his cock and starts stroking as we're driving. Long story short he bred me outside the car behind the Food Lion that was by my house. Then we started doing that all the time and it turned out that he was a big ole bottom pig and an exhibitionist. We'd cruise around the alleys when his girlfriend wasn't over sucking and fucking each other. They're married now. The end "
168,Awww. We need an update afterwards!
169,"LOL if your (that's everyone your, not you as in the OP) partner is talking about divorce because you masturbate, you married the wrong person! Sounds like you and your husband have a healthy sex life. 

Porn and masturbation is only a problem if it takes over your life or if you are using it to the exclusion of sex with your partner (ie: they really want to have sex but you turn them down and jack off alone instead of with them). "
170,"Oh no, I guess I'll just go then😔."
171,"He's cheating on you dude. There's so many ways to load apps without the app store. Unless your boyfriend is a 10/10, no one is impersonating him. 

Are the pictures on Grindr recent? We're all suppose to believe that some rando kept pictures of your boyfriend and has been impersonating him this whole time, living and working in the same location as your boyfriend?

You need to break up with him. The trust is gone."
172,"Sooner or later the mental strain of maintaining this lie will overwhelm your fear of the consequences of telling the truth. 

When that happens, you will come out. 

Until then, you will suffer. How long that lasts is up to you. "

174,"My best friend invited us to this Halloween party where there was a costume contest. I figured I'd go with a low-effort costume and then leave early so I could get some sleep. I was upset that my boyfriend said he couldn't make it, and was dealing with depression cause my best friend/ex-bf passed away among other things. 

I went anyway and was surprised when my friend told me she had a costume picked out for me in the kitchen. So I go out and find this black and silver tunic-like outfit with a mask. So I put it on and go back. They were about to announce the winners of the costume contest when there's all this commotion by the front door to the hall. I look over and see my two best friends who had been missing at the party dressed up as the Black Widow and Iron (Wo)man holding the door open. 

Then my boyfriend walks in dressed as Captain America... Aka the superhero I grew up with and collected comics of and who I just adore. He kept asking everyone if they knew where Bucky was! And then he saw me... Apparently I was Bucky but I had no clue! Lol

I just knew from that day forward that he is the one. He went through the effort of buying my friends costumes and contacting them so that they could make a big entrance to surprise me and it was just so nerdy and fucking adorable and ugh. We also won best Couple Costume! "
175,"Yeah, race comes into it. As in they don't want to date someone they aren't attracted to. They aren't attracted to black guys. 

But they aren't anywhere on the spectrum of systemic racism where it affects your ability to function as a free individual. You can't charge someone as a racist because they aren't attracted to a certain group of people where often times you don't control who or what you're attracted to. This makes about as much sense as saying gays are sexist because they don't date women.  "
176,"6/10 is more than average, tho. (゜-゜)"
177,"Be observant to his reactions, ask him if what you're doing feels good/listen to what he says. Don't be self-centered. Sucking dick is not about showing off your 'mad skillz' or performing for an invisible camera---unless the suckee is into that---it's about doing what the guy likes even if that's the classic suck tip, wank shaft combo. 

Some technical tips:

* Get your gag reflex under control. Easiest way to do this is to *swallow* while your soft palate is being grazed. For some people, the gag reflex is more psychological than physical, they gag just by having something put in their mouth. I don't really know how to fix that. But if you only start gagging once the tip of his cock touches your soft palate, move your mouth and throat as if you were about to swallow something and it will suppress the reflex. 

* Cover your teeth. Seems obvious enough but so many cocksuckers, specially young ones, don't quite get what that means. Fold your lips inward over your teeth. Most of the friction during the blowjob, if you have thin lips, will occur at the border between the mucosa of the lip and the regular skin. Watch our for stubble on that area causing friction burn. 

* Your jaw will hurt more from the action of just keeping your mouth spread than the actual sucking motion. Closing it for just a few seconds will bring you more relief than trying to minimise/stop sucking, tonguing etc. 

* Let your saliva pool in your mouth and use it as lubrication. 

---

Penises are different, as are the brains attached to them. What each person will like can vary wildly but often when giving oral sex you don't have time to put your partner through a survey so it's good to have some baseline, default assumptions that will serve you the majority of the time. There are two ""types"" of penis you're likely to encounter if you live in the US: intact and circumcised and they generally behave differently enough that it's worth having different default ""attack plans"" for them. 

* Most guys, specially circumcised ones, can't cum just from mouth action alone or take too long to do so. If you're just starting out your mouth will get tired before they get to that point, lowering the quality of your sucking at the most critical point of the blowjob. It's OK to use your hands, in fact, many guys require it. 

* Intact men generally prefer varying degrees of direct contact to their exposed glans but it usually tends to be less than 100%, constant stimulation. Some will prefer lots of contact and others virtually not contact whatsoever and will prefer to be sucked through the foreskin with the ocasional swirl of tongue under the skin. Most you encounter will be around the middle, preferring to have the foreskin worked back and forth over the glans inside your mouth or having the glans directly stimulated, covered for a strokes then bared again so that's a good technique to default to. 

* The frenulum area is one of the two most erogenous parts of the penis, the other being the corona of the glans. Most circumcised men have had the frenulum completely excised or might have a frenular ""remnant"", but even if there seems like there's nothing there, the area will still be sensitive. The frenulum is the V shaved area on the underside of the glans and can extend a good inch down the shaft on some men. 

* If you find a guy is struggling to get hard, you can often help him by performing short strokes on the shaft just behind the sulcus. (the area right behind the widest part of the head) Move the skin about half a centimeter up and down in steady, half-second strokes.

178,"I think my favorite part is that [McMullin](https://twitter.com/Evan_McMullin/status/833863025434251264) was involved in taking him down. He's one of the few Republicans that has stood up to Trump and openly said that Republicans have a racism problem to deal with. I lean left, but I respect this kind of conservative. I have to admit that the left hasn't been able to do much about Milo, but the moment the right jumped into help, they found the jugular since they know their own audience better."
179,Most of my straight friends suck at using condoms — I think they use them less than gay people. They expect/request girls to be on the pill or at least take the morning after pill.
180,"christianity.

no, wait ... i gave that up for lent in the 1980s. "
181,"I know my opinion is unpopular, but I actually believe not responding on the first text is more polite than chatting for a while and then stating that you're not interested."
182,"Married now but when I had FWBs I'd usually hang around for a while, cuddle and chat. If it was late sometimes I'd (or he'd) stay the night. I'm a firm believer in the F part of the FWB. We don't have to be besties, but I'd like to be able to carry a conversation with them before and after. Several of them are still my friends now."

188,Not at all. Different guys bring out different feelings. Some guys I want to fuck immediately. With Others I know they are going to fuck me. I completely understand. 
189,"It sounds as if it's all going pretty smoothly. Your dad seems to be making a real effort to learn about and accept something he as a straight man will never be able to completely understand. 

It probably took you some time to come to terms with the fact that you are gay, so allow your dad the same courtesy of coming to terms with your being gay, a gay BF etc. He already has a track record of not understanding, but also one of trying to understand, so just let nature take it's course. It may take more time than you like, but be patient and it will in time all work out for the best."
190,"As for me, it was when I was completely in love with this straight guy to the extent that I showered him with gifts, gave him a free publication in a newspaper, helped him write his paper and pass all of his exams, and proofread all of his paper (because his English is so bad), including his 100 pages-long thesis. After we graduated, he cut off all contact. When I look back now, I was so stupid. I knew I was being used, but I let him use me. And the worst part is he is not an Adonis either. His look is totally not my type and I think most people here would rate him as standard/below. But somehow I fell for him, and now I cringe when I remember this episode."
191,"Disgust is pretty much always cultural, not biological. It's one thing to be uninterested in something, but disgust is a moral emotion, based on what you think should not exist."
192,"Maybe he's always been like that. Maybe he's the type of person that likes talking about himself and your friendship is built on you listening. Friendships need to be mutually beneficial or what's the point. You probably are only realising it now that you have things you want to talk about.

I think you should just tell him things about you instead of waiting for him to ask. Then he will either start asking you more about it and be there for you, or he might just nod and start talking about himself again. And if that's so he might just be really self-centered and you will inevitably start growing apart soon. It happens.

I highly doubt it's some sort of homophobia but who knows. "

197,"The portrayal of Cam doesn't really wrinkle me, because as you say, there are gay guys like that.. and it's not *too* toxic, but rather he is a nice, generous (mostly) character with a fine sense of humour. The character goes well with not just his on-screen partner, but also the rest of the cast. And let's not forget that they're actually portraying a gay couple as loving, stable, with a kid, with close connections to the rest of the family. They are far far far removed from cliche high pitched screechy drama stereotypes like Will &amp; Grace, yet they are not afraid to poke fun at stereotypes either in a very obviously self-aware and tongue in cheek way."
198,This is gay as fuck lol
199,"The backstory is that this man got on PrEP then went on a massive bareback sex binge, taking loads from dozens of guys every month for several months before he tested positive. So, uh, don't do that, OK? If your motivation for going on PrEP is to live out your Treasure Island Media porn fantasies of being the bathhouse cum-dump, maybe that's not such a wise idea.

203,"I don't think banning police from participating in peaceful community outreach like Pride parades is the right way to go. This is one of the good things police do, it seems wrong to sabotage it.

206,"""He isn't violent or mean most of the time"". I'm sorry to say this, but your standards are very low. It should be ""he's never violent and never mean"". You're apologizing on his behalf, that's the first step to being trapped in an abusive relationship. 

There are two options: either he remembers hitting you but is gas lighting you (look up the term, it's a real thing) or he doesn't remember which means he drank so much he blacked out. And he hit you while he was that drunk. One of these options are bad, the other one is worse. "
