0,But this time is different! He accidentally touched my hand that time we were walking someplace and I'm sure that it was some long hidden desire to hold my hand and make love and move in together and make waffles on Sundays!
1,"I actually can't believe the comments in this thread. Who in their right mind thinks that this situation is okay?

It's a well-known fact that the reason that bullies are bullies is usually because their own lives are pretty shitty. That doesn't make what they do okay, but it also doesn't make it okay for your brother to make this kid's life **even worse** as an act of revenge. **Who thinks that driving someone to attempt suicide is morally okay?**

Secondly, where the fuck are your parents in this situation? You're telling me that your 15 year-old brother is in basic contact with over **2 million** people regularly, and your parents aren't even remotely concerned about this? He's being influenced by over **2 million** Twitter followers and your parents are sitting on their asses? What right-minded parent would allow their **child** to have this kind of social media presence?

Yes it's shitty that the school system failed him, but that doesn't make it okay for him to vindictively bully his bully. And it's not just him. He's roped in **millions of people** to cyber bully this kid. This is so much worse than what the bully did to him by several orders of magnitude. 

Who among us can say that we haven't been cruel to someone before when we were stupid kids? Where would we be if every time we were assholes to someone there was a 2 million strong internet hate mob to drive us to suicide? This is the result of call-out culture.

Your parents need to fucking punish your brother. Next they need to delete his fucking Twitter account. No child should be allowed to use social media in this way. The psychological effects of this are clear: this kid **drove someone to attempt suicide**, and he thinks there's **nothing wrong with that**, probably because his 2 million Twitter followers have told him so.

Bullying is not okay. Homophobic bullying is certainly not okay. **Driving someone to attempt suicide is worse**. It's clear to me that your brother's use of social media has warped his mind in a dangerous way. It's beyond me how your parents have sat idly by and allowed this kind of thing to happen. **Kids need to be parented.** You don't just get to sit back and let them do what they like as soon as they hit puberty. Especially online."
2,Thats amazing that you want to help him rather than do something horrible. I can imagine a lot of people in your position would be doing the latter. Good luck!

6,"You're almost definitely being paranoid. Sometimes being vanilla is a reaction to subconscious beliefs that aspects of sex are 'dirty'. This could simply be him reaching a point in his life where he's realised that kink in sex is really, really fun, and can be very easily worked into the body of a healthy sex life and relationship.

Have you had a conversation with him on the subject?

*edit: spelling"
7,"You answered your own question in the first sentence.  Your stepmother is a cunt.  That's why she's doing this.  

The next time she tells you that you should sleep with a woman, say ""I don't know how many times I'm going to have to say this, but I'm not going to fuck you, Elizabeth.  It's getting very uncomfortable for everyone that you're so invested in my sex life.""

I'd tell you to move the fuck out, but you've already got that covered.  Your stepmother and your father are sick in the head, and the further you get away from them, the better off you'll be."

13,I don't recall that exercise at the gym. Is it part of the crossfit craze?
14,"On my phone, but this has been studied a lot among straight men. Bikinis are more arousing than naked. Same would go for us looking at men. If I recall right, one of the theories is that it's part of our hunter-gatherer brain evaluating game or opportunities in the wild. Something keeps our brain intrigued until we get a full look at all sides and are able to assess the full value. It's sorta like, ""If we pick this door, we know we're getting a boat, but if we pick this other door we might get something great, like a boat."""
15,"You're incredibly kind hearted. I think if you confront him he's going to deny it and turn it around on you. As wonderful as it is to have someone as supportive as you around, ultimately this is something he's going to have to come to terms with himself.

I would write him a letter letting him know that you know, you love him, and that you support and accept him. Tell him that if he wants to talk about it and if he wants you to help him work this your arms are open. If he doesn't want to talk about it, thats an option too.

If he's not receptive (and truthfully even if he is), I think you need to end the relationship. In spite of all he's going through he did still lie to you repeatedly, cheat on you, and potentially expose you to STI's (unfortunately guys in his situation aren't known to be too careful). Unless you're interested in a platonic marriage with limited sex, you deserve to pursue someone who can love you wholly and romantically (he does too!). You're young. Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm."

17,"I believe in the scientific method and asking questions. 

I also believe in people. I know there is a lot of fucked up people out there, but I know that most of us are not evil. And thats something I will stick with till I die. "
18,"Effort is a thing of the past. 

No, seriously. I've had to initiate 90% of conversations, guys are often very poor talkers and expect you to do it all, they adamantly refuse to meet very frequently even if you aren't far, and virtually none will chat with you for long unless you're an Adonis.

Too many of you out there really do expect relationships or sex to just be served to you on a golden platter without any reciprocation at all. Selfish bastards -_-"

21,"This doesn't just happen to bicurious straight guys. It also happens to gay guys the first time they have sex. That's why I always encourage beginner gays on this sub to go slow. The first time you play with a guy, don't fuck. Maybe touch his dick and go home. 

There is a cognitive rebound effect. I don't know what else to call it. It comes from holding back all those years, building up fantasies. And then you jump in, and there's this moment of animistic surrender. Then afterwards the brain vomits up negativity for 2-3 days.

I've heard countless stories about guys having sex with virgins, dealing with meltdowns after, being called all kinds of names... and then six months later the former virgin is running around taking a different dick every night.

Curious ""straight"" boys should never attempt more than a massage and handjob their first time. And if it's from a sex worker getting paid for massage-and-handjob (""two bits""), all the better. They expect to get thrown out after.

28,"my friend used to be the medical director for sean cody. on a number of occasions, he was invited to view some scenes being filmed. most/all of those guys are straight, so he said a 30 minute scene would take 4-5 hours to film. they'd go at it for like a minute at a time and completely lose wood, so they'd have to stop filming so they could go watch straight porn and fluff themselves alone.

shit like that is boring as fuck. yes, the guys are good looking, but there's no chemistry or enjoyment whatsoever, and that clearly comes across on camera."

77,"I agree. Yes the bully was wrong, yes the school is at fault too (in my opinion, more so than the bully). But this is suicide.

People saying ""oh he deserves it"" need to take a step back and think for a second. A fucking 17 year old kid fueled with hormones and thoughts going over his head was close to death. NO ONE deserves to be told to kill themselves. Not OP brother or the bully. 

I know revenge is pretty fucking sweet but have we not learned our lesson from the past? How our brothers/sisters of the LGBT fought mental battles in suicide, some losing and taking their own life (because of bullies like these)? And now we are saying the exact same thing to this kid? Are we seriously stooping this fucking low to meet our enemies eye to eye?

LGBT just had Pride month to show how strong we are and how we can overcome bigotry by being the better person. We are supposed to be above them, and that we should not stoop as low as our bullies. "

He wasn't so far from my preference, obviously that he didn't catch my eye, but he definitely wasn't my normal one night stand go-to. Finding out he had a big fat dick, was just a nice bonus.

When things would get rocky, I'd find myself thinking, ""does he really deserve someone who looks like me? Or, am I settling?"" But most of that was the typical sort of doubt you'll have in any relationship (and I was a selfish little SOB in my 20s) and when I started to realize how much he gives me emotionally and spiritually he became more and more attractive in my eyes.

never would i have imagined ending up with someone so drastically different from my ""type,"" let alone positive but...the way that the morning light caresses his face as i glance down to my chest where his head rests...the way he laughs, sometimes to a snort as i pin him down and tickle him...the way he waits for me as i pull my car into the garage then latches onto me like a koala...the way he smells after our day out meandering the downtown streets...  
  
everything about him is worth overlooking a silly ""type"" that's no more than a hollow, shallow mental construct i've built up over the years. and i'm thankful every day i didn't let me box myself in and away from finding true happiness. but ymmv, what's working for me is just that, what works for me :)"

117,"I smoked for 22 years. It was a different time when I started. Most everyone smoked. There were ashstrays inside stores. People smoked inside of the post office while they were standing in line. 

During the time I smoked that all changed. Slowly public opinion towards smoking became less accepting. Places where you could smoke became rarer each year. Cigarettes became more expensive each year. Until the norm had changed from being offered cigarettes at a party similar like being offered a bowl of peanuts, to not being allowed to smoke inside at all. Then it became illegal to smoke inside bars. 

I am glad that this habit has been phased out of public acceptance. Smoking really is terrible for your health. It stains your teeth. It removes your ability to smell and reduces your ability to taste. It does all sorts of things to your internal organs, including layering your lungs in tar. You can taste it on someones semen. 

The fact that I could not smoke anywhere anymore, the fact that none of the people I know smoked, the fact that it became incredibly expensive were all factors which helped me finally quit. 

I'm smoke-free for a little over a year now and it is the best thing I have ever done for my health. I re-painted the inside of my house and threw out some furniture which was just too soaked in residu.  I can smell spring and summer again and food tastes great. I can do sports again without going out of breath almost immediately. 

And yet I still miss it for about 2 minutes a day. You have to understand, smoking is about as addictive as heroin  and it is that way on purpose. You are not smoking pure tobacco. All kinds of chemicals are added to it and some of those are added for their addictive qualities, like formaldehyde. That's right, the same stuff used to embalm corpses is added to cigarette tobacco just because it is highly addictive in minute doses. 

Do yourself a huge favour. Quit. Quit now. Quit while you're ahead. It's not like smoking even gives you any benefits. All the so-called pleasure you feel from it in fact are the withdrawal symptoms going away. That's it. That's the only reason you smoke. So you don't have to feel the withdrawal symptoms. 

If you can't do it on your own go see your doctor. Get a medication called Champix, Chantix in the USA. It works by attaching itself to those parts of the brain which nicotine also attaches itself to, thereby fooling your body into thinking it has already smoked. 

You know you don't want to smoke, not really. It's just a habit you rolled into and you don't really know how to quit. And that's understandable because quitting is really, really hard. But if I can do it after 22 years then so can you. And you deserve to treat yourself the best way that you can. "

At my first Pride event, I couldn't really relate to the HIV ribbons, drag queens, muscle guys with shirts off.  As a monogamous type guy, I've found it hard to relate to guys on hookup apps or all the promiscuity and open relationships you see in bars.  My *personal* values are just different that what I've seen around me.  

All the silly ""bear"", ""twink"" labels and focus on muscles and extreme masculinity aren't helpful either.  As a smaller hung guy too, I've had a lot of exes make fun of me about it directly to my face...it hurts.  It hasn't exactly been a welcoming, friendly experience, and I'm now at 31 hoping to someday find a guy to settle down with and make more close friends.  I'm trying to get out more, but it's just hard to meet other gay guys in a non-sexualized environment.

I think in general, many **people** are just assholes.  Being gay kind of adds extra baggage to that.  Plus, it's simply harder to find each other unless you are an extreme social butterfly, in a very large city like NY or LA where there are more social groups and organizations, or have working ""gaydar"".  It's been a struggle for me finding gay men I can relate to, but one day at a time..."

133,No to either of them. That is the ultimate betrayal of trust. That would just say to me that I'm not enough for them and they really don't care about me
134,"&gt; Because some people feel that there are more important things that this.

I feel like this is a valid excuse if and only if the party weren't busy or had not been busy proactively combating pro-LGBT changes. Or busy drafting bills concerned with who is using what bathroom."
135,I think you're spending too much time with the wrong gay people.
136,"It's frowned upon, and you're ostracized by most people. They just don't want to be around you. People under 30 generally don't care. I live in Southern Virginia. The city is more liberal, but the county is really conservative. However, there's sort of a southern manners type thing going on, where most people who disprove would never be openly rude to you. Some however, will certainly be rude. I haven't experienced it towards myself, since most people don't guess my sexuality. I have had dates who have been treated unkindly."
137,Wait you shook hands goodnight? Is he your boss? I'm going to go ahead and say the cat is the least of your issues right now.
138,"Nope -- not causing a scene at someone else's wedding is hardly ever the wrong way to go.  

The groom would probably be mortified by his father's behavior.  Sorry that happened to you guys."
139,"""Watch out for the door frame.""

""I don't need you to keep remindi-"" *CLUNK*"
140,i play video games but also i am fat
141,"I personally can't stand any form of the word faggot. I'd say that word was directed at me growing up more than any other derogatory term, and hearing it makes me feel like I'm back as a teenager getting picked on in school. 

I know some of us have embraced terms like queer and whatnot, but they've never meant anything good to me. In fact, none of those words are in my active vocabulary. There's plenty of ways to voice your opinions without using these trashy terms."
142,"""Please ... ""

""Please sit on my face."""
143,Wear a hat that says masc4masc.
144,"this is an uncomfortable situation to be in. I really hate how these newer generations are so easily given access to this online world that can be just as bad, if not worse, than the real world. 

I persoanlly think that your brother should delete that tweet and post a public apology instead. That guy was on the verge of suicide and while he isnt a sweet peach, he is still a human being who is growing. There's also a ton of reasons why your brother should be the bigger person in all of this. If that guy kills himself your bro will have to live with the emotional consequenses of that for his whole life. He will be known as ""the asshole who pushed a kid into killing himself"" The immense toll that would take on your family would be too hurtful.

Imo, apologizing is the best thing he could do now. While he isnt physically killing someone, he is contributing to the misery and sadness of another person."
145,Yes I'm gay and would never identify as 'queer' because I don't have that holier-than-thou attitude like your friend.
146,Can we sticky this post?
147,Convince my hot straight buddy while he's drunk to suck my cock and let me fuck him 
148,"""And Yay God said unto Abraham, when one door closeth, the door to a ripped, hot guy with a pool openeth."" That was always my favorite Sunday school lesson.

1, never question why someone likes your body. I used to do this a lot, and I've learned it doesn't help anything. Just be happy someone does. Plus, everyone has different types.

2, No, you're case is the first I've heard where it happened sort of organically. I've definitely heard of guys getting stood up who go to the bar or something with the intention of scoring.

3, you're being self conscious. He's more muscular, but not everyone likes that. That should be obvious, since he obviously liked you enough.

4, Sorta. I've been much more confident in my appearance since I got laid, but that's been a while back. Getting laid again by a new person kinda reinforces it in your head that it's not a fluke. I think most of us are overly critical of ourselves."
149,"I think its great. Love doing it as we both kind of get warmed up.

But I can't be the only one who thinks the term ""frottage"" sounds fucking gross. "
150,"Yes. 

Next question?"
151,Bi guys exist. 
152,Bottom here. I can't get hard to top :(
153,Brit detected. 
154,"I think it's partly from all the messages we get in the media. Look at the fashion ads, the magazine covers, the hero roles in movies, the ""heartthrob"" lists... It's the the same stereotypical, muscly white man.

This constant barrage of the stereotypical male type influences people subconsciously.

"
155,What's most baffling is almost none of these guys are anything to run home and brag about either.
156,"guy came inside my sneakers and made me walk around in them all day.

did nothing for me other than feel a little gross, but he was super hot and it drove him wild."
157,That's... advanced. That's advanced. 
158,"I know a straight guy who was married for several years. He got immense pleasure from his wife scratching his back.

One night she announced that she would no longer scratch his back.

He responded in a very weak way saying ""That's not fair !""

That did not change her mind.

They have remained married for many years since then but that was the first sign of a change in her attitude toward him and the marriage. The marriage has suffered greatly.

He could have gotten out of bed, sat in a chair away from her and said...

""That is not OK. That gives me a lot of pleasure and you are suddenly ending it with no explanation. And apparently very little concern for my happiness and well being and the future of our marriage.  This is going to require some very serious discussion of what thoughts you are having that would permit you to do this.""

He regrets not having done this at that crucial turning point.

I think you should not make the same mistake. This is a serious matter and it deserves a very serious discussion.

But even if that discussion results in his doing what you want, it is still a problem if he is doing it under protest.  

He should be feeling joy in giving you pleasure.

So that must be part of the discussion."
159,"""We don't use lube and don't do foreplay""

There's your problem."
160,"Bathroom laws are not a media invention, they are a Republican one. They were drafted, sponsored, voted on, and signed into law by Republicans. They are the latest in a long line of social wedge issues the Republican Party is using to rile up its base and distract from its complete inability to govern effectively. "
161,Gotta leave something to the imagination. 
162,"Trump has been good to the gays? Which words do you believe more? Words of indifference which people look at and go, ""Oh my god! He's so middle of the road for a Republican,"" or when he said he'd nominate Supreme Court justices to [overturn the Obergefell decision?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-marriage-equality_us_56af63c8e4b00b033aafb496)

Which Trump do we believe? Which Trump is telling the truth about what he'd actually do?

Trump has no doubt been gay friendly for someone of his background up until he started running for president last year. But I wouldn't dare take the chance that his personal feelings are either pro-gay or at least indifferent to gay, when he has said he'd ""strongly consider,"" whatever that means, nominating justices who would overturn the decision. That's not gay friendly."
163,"I am pretty camp and people are surprised that I am gay.  
Some people just have no one they know that isn't a cis hetero so they don't expect someone to be gay. Even if they might suspect something because you are super femme, they will manage to ignore that ;)"
164,"This bully started a battle and lost, even after your brother offered him multiple opportunities to back down with no consequences.  Your brother went through all the proper channels beforehand to no avail.

Now, obviously I don't condone or support destroying someone over social media, but it's very easy to see how he felt that this was his only avenue of self-defense.  And that's why I don't Think what he did was quite as egregious as some others do.

It is not really fair to judge your brother, as some have done, by the fact that the bully attempted suicide. Your brother couldn't have reasonably predicted that the bully was this fragile. And provoking suicide certainly wasn't your brother's goal.

But I absolutely do fault your brother for his lack of compassion now that he is aware of the bully's mental state.  At this point, he is just twisting the knife and being sadistic by leaving the tweets up."
165,"It's Grindr. If you want to meet guys, just play Pokemon Go instead. "
166,GURL it's always been there....like Levi's. 
167,"He's not your boyfriend, you're his live-in fuck boy. Get out while you still can"
168,I believe in the heart of the cards. I also believe in life after love.
169,I don't remember him. Is he one of the newer guys?
170,"Stop kidding yourself, you smell like an ashtray. You just can't smell it. The gum, mints and spray doesn't cut it. Sorry, but you could be the hottest guy out there and the second you pull out a cig and light it I am 100% not interested. All of my friends are the same way. Make the switch to e-cigs or vaping. You can get your nico fix, and not offend everyone within the breathing area."
171,"otoh, if a bottom is rock hard the entire time I might just assume they're on viagra

different people are wired differently... I *love* bottoming, but have never been able to actually maintain an erection while doing it. even if I have a hands-free orgasm while bottoming, my dick is totally soft."
172,"I've heard Sean Cody likes to brag about how their actors are straight. Plus I think it really draws gay viewers with their love of straight men, and their actors are sexy as hell. Sean Cody does alright with making them look passionate enough, imo."
173,"Dudes use ""stocky"" like women use ""curvy""."
174,"Your friend is romanticising a time when systematic oppression of LGBT+ people was the norm and needs to get slapped back into reality.  LGBT+ folk of the generations before us fought for our right to have ""boring"" lives.  It's thanks to this relatively ""boring"" situation that being gay is no longer considered strange, weird or frowned upon in parts of the world, and why it's less common to be picked on, bullied and oppressed for a part of ourselves that we can't control.  It's sad to see your friend looking at how gay men had to be secretive in their advances in order to stay safe as the good old days."
175,every single disney movie.
176,The things we do for ~~love~~ sex
177,I wish my high school teachers were gay... lots of hot teachers in my school.
178,we gave each other BJs in the beginning but otherwise no 
179,"No. Remember his faults. You've seen him eat, and know all the stupid stuff he does. Focus on strangers instead. Perhaps your local barista, or some guy at the gym."
180,"He wants a flat mate, not a husband. You need to grow up and escape this daft notion that nice = interested. 

Otherwise, you'll be back tomorrow crying about how you got rejected and you like totally can't even. "
181,"Because i rarely find the type of guys i'm into and my mind and body will physically not let me settle for less and pretend like I enjoy it. So I'll wait forever if I have to, to find the right person. - 21 year old male who has been forever single so far."
182,"But he's different than all the other straight guys, because I like him."
183,"For me it's having to tell people that you're gay. I'm sure many already know I am after speaking with me, but it's not an aspect of myself that I want to be defined as. I'm in no way ashamed of being gay, but I don't think sexual orientation/the gender of who you date is important."
184,"It's around because people like it and there's a community. It's the same sort of reasons people join board gaming clubs when they like board games. If you actually want to get into the history of it, [this](http://www.cuirmale.nl/history/gayleather.htm) isn't too bad of a guide as is [this](http://self.gutenberg.org/articles/leather_subculture). You could also see the documentary [Kink Crusaders](https://youtu.be/JgB62FLsSes) though that focuses on the history of the leather contest."
185,"Despite the preponderance of evidence, it sounds like he hasn't fully accepted it yet.

I think you should talk to him, but I think you should give it more time first. At this point, if you say to him ""I know you're gay"" he may still believe that he's not, and dig his heels in and make it a you v. him issue. 

How long has this been going on? I'd give it another month if you think you can stand it. A least try to get out of the church phase first.

On the flip side, make sure to protect yourself during sex with him since we know he's soliciting sex from the internet.

Please keep us updated. You're doing the right thing."
186,"I don't doubt this is a thing - but honestly you can choose what you expose yourself to. Where is this gay stereotype coming from? Shit TV? Stop watching shit TV. There are a ton of different portrayals of gay men out there - just be more choosy about what you pay attention to. And also, if this bothers you that much it's coming from somewhere in you. If you know who you are and are happy with it there's no reason to give a shit about what the world thinks about gay people. They don't know you, so why care? Being told you don't 'seem gay' a lot doesn't sound like the worst thing to put up with tbh. "
