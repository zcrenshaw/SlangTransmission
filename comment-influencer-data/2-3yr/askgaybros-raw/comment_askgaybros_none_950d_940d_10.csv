0,My SO does this cute (but also annoying) thing where he loves to play hide &amp; seek before sex. It's been 10 years and I still haven't found him yet...
1,"um no hes completely wrong, not all gays do that"
2,"Eh I think you're in the right here. Dude touched you while you were sleeping, that's creepy and weird. Then him telling you about it in a tone like that just makes it more weird for me. "
3,"Maybe I'm too forgiving, but I would take into account his age at the time of the offense. We all made a lot of stupid decisions at 15, 16, etc. He was very wrong to do it -- no debate there -- but only you can assess whether this is a big enough revelation to make you end the friendship. The law doesn't hold a 15 year old to an adult standard, so I would look at it through the lense of his immaturity and poorly-formed decision-making ability (the teen brain thing you have no doubt read about). 

The fact he told you at age 22 means he has been tortured about it and needed to confess, even if he chose to laugh it off as crazy shit he did as a kid. But he gets credit in my book for telling you. 

You are right that it is not jutifiable. You are right to feel hurt and violated. I would try to make the best decision about whether the revelation of this incident from 7 years ago is worth no longer being his friend.  You called him your best friend; you called him your brother. That's bigger than this.  I would forgive. "
4,"You need to back up and let him move at his own pace. EVERY gay person goes through their OWN personal coming out and acceptance and the time frame, reasoning/understanding VARIES greatly. 

Keep being there for him, supporting HIS decision, and encouraging him to explore and understand himself, but don't push him. "

6,"I mean just go talk to her. Cat's out of the bag now, nothing you can do, bite the bullet and go own it. 

And report back here of course "

8,You should be more concerned about your man since he has to agree to be stolen away from you. 
9,"I'm 6'4"" and I'm all about a shorter guy climbing me like a jungle gym. "
10,"Another slut finds his way to milk himself. This is such a good day. (´⌣`ʃƪ)

Congrats, friend! But this is only the beginning. Now you have to find the technique that will allow you to do that again and again, much faster and intense!"
11,never have i ever had sex :)))))))
12,RUN AWAY. You risk exposing yourself to diseases and addiction. This could literally ruin your life. It's really telling that he's also trying to pressure you get into that scene.
13,"You're not overreacting. The chemsex scene is, in my experience, a niche group, and people having sex only on drugs is an even smaller group. I don't think that dating someone who is that dependent on drugs to have sexual pleasure, where you are not into drugs at all, is a good match.

I'd say that this would be a deal breaker."
14,Never have I ever had sex with someone I was attracted to.
15,"He likes to mouthfuck me, which is fine, but it's so hard to do with him. 5'5"" slim small filipino guy with the thickest fattest fucking cock I've ever seen, it's not even long at all either it's just all girth. like how, he's so meek and shy and BAM his soda can bounces out of his undies. It's like a calculus assignment to figure out how I'm gonna fit this sand wedge in my mouth without toothscraping it. He really loves it though and it's so hot how he does it so it's not all bad"
16,Yeah but you'll be alright. It was also embarrassing when my fundamentalist parents found a stack of printed out gay watersports porn in my room at 14 years old. You'll be ok.
17,Never have I ever had unprotected sex.
18,"I get where you're coming from, there does seem to be a handful of guys here who like talk shit about monogamy or really promote cheating/FWB/hookups. Folks, end of day, do what you want, but fuck you if you try to impose it on others or hurt people with your actions. "
19,This is too perfect to be real ;)
20,I have never topped during sex
21,"I haven't asked yet! I feel like ""Why did you ignore my super like?"" Is not the best conversation to have haha"
22,... Or we could just start a big orgy.
23,"""I've got a PhD too. Pretty huge dick!"" That one has always made me laugh. "
24,"Uh--yeah. Right here. I like guys of all shapes and sizes. Always have, always will.

Trust me, I'm not the only one.

Unclear how guys can be that disgustingly rude to people, though."
25,He's a professional troll just like Anne Coulter. Being gay is one of his gimmicks to market himself as a commodity.
26,No please don't.  He sounds like a wolf in sheep's clothing. 
27,"in america, that's called a law suit. "
28,Never have I ever drank cum 
29,Never have I ever had semen on my face.
30,I have never had sex in public
31,Never have I ever purchased or used a sex toy.
32,"Updoot. Good luck on the date, dude! "
33,"Saying boi pussy might be the fastest way to get me flaccid. Not currently in a relationship, but my ex bf had a habit of using teeth during the bj portion of sex. He kept assuring me that all guys liked that. I was like, nah dude, not one single person likes teeth marks in their dick. "
34,Nothing you can do. You won't get closure. This has nothing to do with you and everything to do with him. On to the next one.
35,"I wonder how much of that is just gay dudes misinterpreting signals because they want so badly for it to be true, just like when straight guys think women are into them just because they're being friendly. "
36,"(\*\^\^)\/｡･:\*:･ﾟ’★,｡･:\*:･ﾟ’☆ Congratulations!!

&gt;just told her that i'm gay and she said no shit.

I know that type of reaction, my sister did the same thing. (ಠ_ಠ)

It kinda made me feel stupid, but I was glad that she was ok with that. ♥"
37,"This only a small thing but when we do have sex it is often to slow and sensual, like I want to get pounded but we also have to keep the noise down"
38,xxxx
39,Grab em by the boy pussy?
40," It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair…"

43,"I don't want to be alone, but I do need to spend time by myself.  I'm the classic introvert.  Being with other people can be fun and exciting, but it's always exhausting.  I need time where I just don't need to see another human being, in order to recharge.

"
44,"I'm 5'4"" and I feel you. Being gay is definitely mitigating the damage. There are certain guys who didn't like me because of my height, sure, but it's probably better than being short and straight."
45,"Allowed rimming, been rimmed, or have rimmed. No thx."
46,"&gt; in my eyes this is not ok and not justifiable.

Exactly, no consent = rape. And hes dead wrong if he thinks its normal for gay guys to do that when they're younger."

49,You ever have a nice girthy dick in your ass? Feels nice and filling. Reminds me of my dad's.
50,"Yes, but not necessarily because of the reasons you listed. It's just that when someone finally accepts themselves, they wouldn't want to change who they are."
51,You have a lumberjack fetish. 
52,"Honestly, I would forgive too. But for me at least, that requires some recognition that what he did was wrong."
53,"In his defense, I don't really think this is first date material.  I do absolutely think he should be honest about it, but maybe give him a few more dates?  "
54,I have never been in a threesome.
55,"I dont wanna be a asshole or anything but 




i mistakenly read this as




""Monopoly is not a fantasy /rant""




Also yes Monopoly is fun at first but then you lose money and start to hate your boyfriend and you wonder how the hell he got sent to jail 4 times all ready then wish you could sleep with his brother just to get back at him for putting you in bankruptcy.



Monopoly ruins relationships




As for the whole Monogamy vs Open 



If Monogamy works for you then Monogamy is the best thing for you.




If Open works for you then Open is the best thing for you.

I must admit I did not handle the situation the best way. It caught me by surprise. Like I said, he never showed any homosexual behavior  during our teenage years or any attraction to my person; this must have been extremely painful for him, to have to suppress his true self and his urges. 

Not that this justifies anything but I should've talked it out with him more calmly and maybe he wouldn't have reacted in that manner either. 

I know that I am willing to move past this so long as he apologizes for this. 
If he decided to tell me after all of this time it is obviously still bothering him and I should give him the opportunity to apologize for it. "
83,"Scenario: You're riding along in the car with your mum and there's a hot guy with not a lot of clothing on walking on the sidewalk. Where are your eyes? Now multiply that scenario by the thousands of interactions with any sort of sexual/titillating undertone that your mother may have witnessed, and can you honestly say that you have reacted like a straight guy? Remember that avoiding looking at a hot guy on the street can be just as much of a giveaway as staring at him."

85,"Congrats on the weight loss. That's about as much as I have to lose. Focusing on core exercises may very well tighten up the skin (depending on your age and skin elasticity). You can get the skin removed though you may have to pay out of pocket.

With that said, Grindr is the epitome of shallow males. Many 10/10s don't get attention on there because some people have insane standards. I suggest trying to find activities you like to do and meeting guys that way along with trying a plethora of apps. Your weight loss is no small feat and while you may still dislike your body in some ways, be happy with what you did and try to find out how to get rid of the loose skin."
86,Oh please. Your straight friend has absolutely experienced homophobia. Fear of being called a fag is why he won't order fruity drinks or admit to liking pop music. 
87,"You did everything right. 

Dude coulda been a catfish or maybe a closeted guy who got cold feet. You'll never know. Don't beat yourself up about this. "
88,"&gt; I have 3 little brothers, and it recently came out that all of us are gay.

HOLY SHIT, I have 4 older brothers and Im the only gay one. They're late teens, Im sure they've seen anal before if they have access to the internet, just remind them of how important condoms are, talk about cleaning out the back door, talk about consent and being safe and that its ok to beat a bitch ass if anything is being forced.

He becomes that special person which shares secrets with you, that cares about you and that tries to be with you whenever it's possible. You can feel safe and comfortable around him and he won't judge you.

With right boyfriend you're compeletly honest and that feels like you're allowing him to enter your mind and you don't feel alone with your thoughts anymore. You share bizarre ideas, check out the same guys and plan how would you use them in bed together.

You stop thinking ""me"" and you start thinking ""us"". When you hear about some terrible accident, your first thought is not ""happily, I'm in my home and I'm safe"", you think ""where is he now? I have to call him""."

Peahens usually went for the longest tail feathers when selecting mates. So, the scientists added artificial feathers to extend the peacock's tail feathers.

They found that there was no end to how much the tail feather length would make the peahens go wild. Even when the tail feathers got into impossibly long variations, the peahens only went crazier. There was no point where they were like, ""now, that's just ridiculous."" More is better was just weirdly drilled into their brain. 

My hunch is that there could be a reptile brain thing like this going on where the excess of a sexual trait just triggers something in the brain regardless of practicality. Most humans can eventually recognize something like this and realize it's not important, but sex is a weak spot and the rest never stop to think about it."

And then the cum hits your throat or tongue, depends where it is in a specific moment. Cum tastes terrible, it's warm but it's noticeably colder than sucked meat.

He was very passionate and could suck my dick like no other. He had a way of taking care of me, all the while he was fucking me aggresively. I think about the moment time to time.

Those larger cities tend to come with a higher cost of living.

I'm sure if there were an option for all gay people who wanted to be in that environment to live in less expensive cities, they'd do it. Just like anyone would. Haha.

You could always try moving to locations *close* to those bigger cities. For example, NY might be really expensive, but if you live a short PATH ride away in NJ, you'll be paying much less and still be really close to a lot of gay folk."

175,Where's your discount code
176,Never have I ever had sex while high.
177,"Well, he has no obligation to come out, so he should do it when he feels ready.  Your role there is to support him with whatever decision he makes.  

You two have a unique opportunity though.  You know you have parents that don't approve, and you know both of you are ""guilty,"" in their book for lack of a better word.  This should strengthen your relation ship even more (as if it already wasn't strong being twins in the same house).  Stand by and support each other.  That's the best thing you can do.  "
178,Religious freedom my ass. Fuck your religion. 
179,"It was probably like 4 years ago with my bf. We went at it and just couldnt stop. Idk what the hell came over us, but it was like we both just switched into this perfect sex mode and had the most raw and passionate sex ive ever had in my life. I came twice without even touching myself and he must have blown like 3 loads. I remember just laying there with him afterwards and we were completely speechless. "
180,[deleted]
181,Because they get more dick this way.
182,"Plot twist, OP likes Canada because there are guys from everywhere. "
183,"&gt; She didnt really say anything, just closed the door and went away

&gt; My mom isn't homophobic or anything

You have a cool mom.  I'm pretty sure some other moms would have gotten into a tizzy at that moment.  Can't change what happened.  Just own it."
184,"I'm a trans guy too and while I've had some issues in the past with people just being assholes to me because I'm trans, I've actually found that a lot of gay dudes don't really care. Most of them have been super nice, even the ones who rejected me. If anything, they were very apologetic and felt pretty bad about the whole thing.

YMMV, obviously, but I think you'll be fine. Just don't take it personally if you're rejected. Remember that cis guys get rejected too for all sorts of reasons. That's just life -- you can't please everyone.

Edit: I'm married now btw. If I can do it, so can you!"
185,"Well, there are plenty of straight men who are misogynistic, so yes."
186,what i can't understand is why someone would still persist on wanting to go out with a person who rejected them again and again and again across  THREE media platforms. the struggle is real.
187,Fuck Trump and fuck his supporters. He is deeply unpopular and illegitimate and the republicans in congress are going to dump him once they're through getting what they want.
188,A jobs a job. Why do you care so much? 
189,"Dude, don't have your first time in a public bathroom!  Among other things, it's illegal and it's not uncommon for security to watch areas like that pretty closely."
190,.
191,"There is no such thing as a reasonable argument against homosexuality. It just *is*. It's a totally natural thing that harms no one, so I don't pay attention to anyone who tries to argue against it. "
192,"This was almost believable until OP defined a 17 yo who had never had sex with a boy before as ""masterful"" in bed.

Cute story though."
193,"&gt;I was like, nah dude, not one single person likes teeth marks in their dick.

Oh, my sweet summer child. "
194,Do you mean the Lady Gaga concert?
195,"Hell yes.  I'm all about the short, fat, furry little pocket bears.  "
196,Are you me?
197,"I guess I should mention my three-and-halfsome, but not this time.

My most memorable sex was free of filth, Dom/sub thing, dirty talk and kinky stuff. I was really upset over something and really bitchy to him. I wouldn't be so forgivable for myself, but fortunately he was. He came to me when I was lying on the bed, he kissed me in my cheek and he told me that he loves me.

We started making out and he stripped me in no time. We were looking in our eyes and exchanging kisses, while he was pounding my asshole. It wasn't the most comfortable position, but I really needed to see that fire in his eyes. It made me feel loved and desirable.

He wasn't kinky or dominant in any way, but he was still fucking me really hard and intense. He wasn't teasing me, he just came inside of me as soon as he was close. After that I had tears in my eyes and I was gasping like after a hardcore marathon.

The only thing he said before cuddling me to sleep was ""Better?"". He really knew what I needed at this moment."
198,Butt hair doesn't bother me. I find it manly. 
199,"I understand, it took me few days, too. (≖‿ ≖)"
200,"&gt;But now that I'm not horny I'm having second thoughts


hahahahahahaha!
"
201,I'll never tell my parents this but the main reason I went to grad school was to find a guy to marry. It worked. I got my My MA and my Mr.
202,"My boyfriend loves calling me these embarassing pet names during sex, probably because he wants to see me blush. Another weird think he sometimes loves if licking the inside of my ear, it feels really gross."
203,Welcome to the wonderful world of ghosting. 
204,I'm more of a top and I totally dig very tall guys. I'm not gonna go into details but there's something extremely arousing in being with someone who looks like a giant to you.
205,"5. An ear to talk to

4. Emotional support

3. Making him laugh

2. Empathy

1. Being able to take his huge dong... I mean, seriously! It's really huge!"
206,"&gt; he asks me to go to the bathroom with him to watch him while he pees

what"
207,I have never participated in an orgy
208,Mark E Miller is cool but he makes me not happy with my life so I stopped following him. Tired of seeing guys flaunt their seemingly perfect lives
209,They don't get that sweet YouTube money if they don't market themselves right.
210,"He won't do that because his story is made up.

Thousands of people open threads on this sub every month - yet he's the first person to complain about that? How come? The other people who've commented here, while not doubting him, say they haven't experienced the same. And his account is actually one month old. Why would a """"""""straight"""""""" guy be opening so many threads on this sub in such short time span? He doesn't explain, even though that would be relevant to know why anyone would be PMing him. He did find time to claim he's straight, even though this has no relevance to his little story other than to insinuate, ""eww you're gross""."
211,"it's probable that it is your prostate. does this happen with every guy? all positions? some positions (and some men) can hit my prostate really well, and it can be very pleasurable but like anything else there is a fine line between pleasure and pain (or in this case, the need to use the toilet.)

have you ever just let the guy keep going to see what happens? try letting yourself go once, relax, and see where it takes you. if that doesn't help, smoke some weed before you have anal."
212,"THERE

IS

NOTHING

WRONG

WITH

BEING

A

STEREOTYPE"
213,"100% of teenagers believe that they are mature for their age and ready to handle adult responsibility, so I'm not really surprised this kid is cruising for dick on the internet."
214,My time to shine!!!
215,Your roomate is not straight. Ask him out.
216,"This. I've witnessed countless guys trash people in closed relationships, sex is only a body function, we're not built for one partner, its a straight concept pushed on it. All a load of shit do what makes you happy. Equally some in closed relationships trash those in open as not real relationships. Bottom line is if you want an open find someone who wants the same and the same thing goes for those who want closed."
217,"You can't talk to him about being gay - it's not your place to do that and could easily be seen as inappropriate. What you *can* do is be the happiest, most self-accepting, most emotionally grounded gay man the world has ever seen. Good role models are just good people. Let the kid see that being gay can be a positive and happy thing - give him that option - that's what role models do - they give kids options of the types adults they can become. 

Edit:
&gt;how much a better person he was than all his peers…

That's kinda heterophobic - that's not being a good role model!!"
218,lol fuck him. Good for you for not playing into his little game while he flaunted his new boyfriend. 
219,uhm I have some bad news for you buddy
220,Guyyyyyssss my new bf is this really hot porn star. HELP!!!!!
221,"Yeah, porn and the like make the stereotyping worse... especially on the apps too "
222,Adults.
223,"I thought I was bi pretty much my whole life, I just never came out or talked about it. When I was a teen I started dating a girl who pursued me, and I ended up dating her for a number of years. After we broke up I finally said ""fuck it"" and decided to sleep with a dude. I pretty much realized I was gay the next morning when I woke up. 

Thinking that you're bi is actually a very common thing for gay men before they come out. Since this is such a regular occurrence, it contributes to bisexual erasure. It gives people the false idea that bi is just a stepping stone to full on gay. "
