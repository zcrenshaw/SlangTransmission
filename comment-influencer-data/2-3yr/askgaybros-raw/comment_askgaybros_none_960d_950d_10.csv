2,What the fuck did I just read
3,"He's not friends with you. He's friends with a nonexistent straight version of you that he has created in his mind. Not bringing it up again is a ridiculous suggestion. At some point you will have a boyfriend. Never mentioning that to your friend/room mate will be very close to impossible. You will never be able to have your future bf come over, or hang out with your friends. It's just compltely unreasonable."
4,Name and shame
5,"Meh. Ignorance is ignorance. While not your job, it was a good opportunity to educate and explain to him how ignorant he was being and how offensive it could be. Because obviously at that point you would have had no interest in dating him again. lol"
6,I think you'll find that's Golden Retrievers. 
7,"I once was at a bar and a cute British guy started chatting with me. I think I'm pretty good looking, but I've never been hit on before so I'm just going along with conversation. 

I'm mid sentence telling him a story and he just leans in, hugs me, and says it's been great talking to me and begins to walk away. I'm standing there thinking this guy is a total dick until he turns around and says, ""I'm not actually leaving; I just wanted to hug you."" Definitely scored points and 100% made out with him by the end of the night. "
8,"Yes, lets name and shame them. **Dilfhunter.**"
9,"I seriously don't mean to post a condescending ""it'll get better when you're older"" response...but, if you haven't already recognized it, your parents are just people, with their own talents and deep flaws, just like us all. That's the first step. Second step is the recognition that comes later that you're not responsible for your parents' happiness or satisfaction.

If you're financially dependent on them and you have any misgivings about how they'd react, it's perfectly moral to stay in the closet to them until that's no longer the case. After that, just be you, recogize they're adults, they've got coping skills, and they'll work through it themselves. Or maybe they won't? Either way, there's little you can do about it other than be emotionally available if they handle it well, and if they don't, to have empathy for them until they come around, but have the discipline and self-esteem to not allow their feelings about it to derail you.  ðŸ˜˜"
10,Tell him to get used to it or you can't be friends. No reasoning with these things. Better to have it out of your life.
11,"late 30's, been with the same guy for almost 11 yrs, married for 1, tolerable office job, zero desire for children, travel and collecting are fun.  I garden a lot during the summer. cook a lot during the winter. the domestic thing is totally my jam; same with my partner.

the nice thing about getting older is that there's a lot less to prove. 

edit:  am happy."
12,"Close-up shots. I can't stand seeing only the dick going in/out of a butt. Gotta appreciate the faces and bodies behind the passion, so please show it all."
13,"It's just the sub-group of dudes on here who are super thirsty for the fantasy of getting with straight guys and pursue way too enthusiastically/won't take no for an answer. Those guys are also under the impression that no straight guys would ever come here to talk to gay guys unless they were bicurious, which is then why they think they have a shot at you. It's really silly. We, the normal gay dudes among us, apologize for their desperate antics."
14,Use barbecue sauce as lube.  Problem solved.
15,I'll call my bussy whatever I want to. 
16,I know.  It is almost as annoying as the time I was with my best friend.   He was straight and we wanted to go swimming but forgot our bathing suits....
17,"""Joke's on you. Being ghosted is my fetish."""
18,"Yes, looking like a roided out lab rat crossed over with a leather handbag is not ok."
19,"&gt;Here's the jist of it:
&gt;
&gt; - I'm pretty racist "
20,[deleted]
21,Anyone who thinks Trump is gonna stand up for gay rights has their head up their ass.
22,omg gurls bussy is so 2016 we say buttwat now
23,Your straight friend/coworker/landlord/barista/plumber/whatever will never be gay no matter how much you want them to be or how much you crush on them so don't try and pursue that.
24,Tell him he can either get used to it or become a smaller part of your life. Same thing can be said to parents who act this way.
25,"I think (not to be offensive) that a lot of things you've posted are more generalizations/personality traits, because I know a lot of guys that are *not* like that, and a lot of girls that are. 

I would say the things I like about a man are things (apart from his genitals) that make him a man. I like kissing/making out with a guy and feeling stubble. I like the larger frame and muscles that guys have, whether I'm holding them or vice versa. I like deep voices, they go right to my groin (although there's nothing wrong with higher voices). I like playing with their shorter hair. And sometimes I like when the testosterone comes out and they're really aggressive.

Ugh, now I have to head into work with a boner.
"
26,"Step #1: Be attractive.
Step #2: Don't be unattractive."
27,"&gt;##*And just fucking ask him.*

#HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT, HE'S IN FUCKING COMA -_-"
28,I feel like I just read your diary..
29,"&gt; Straight people don't have to choose between their diet and their ability to have non-disgusting penetrative sex

True...  But there is ""that time of the month"""
30,"It belongs to him, he can do whatever he wants with it."
31,"While I don't use the words 'pussy' or 'bussy' to refer to my hole, it's none of my business if other guys wish to refer to their own holes using those terms.  To each their own."
32,"Legit that was pretty fucking smooth. 

I'm smooth af (and yea cocky too) but I'm more direct. If I saw a guy I liked I'd just go up to them and start talking about anything. Keep it light and make a bunch of jokes. Semi cheesy jokes are fucking gold. All you need is a good sense of humor and most guys will love you"
33,Dump the motherfucker already.
34,Holy shit you two need jesus
35,"Lmao, I wish

P.S. Great advice tho

*looks at ugly self* I'm sexy af"
36,"So can we see yer dick then? /s

On a serious note that's weird as fuck and shows what women go through on the daily. "
37,"Of course!

He's a master in my bedroom, partner in my life, but also a leader of my Guild, ally of my civilization and jungler for my support. ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)"
38,"Yes, thighs are my favourite body part, alittle bit more than ass, thick thighs make the dick rise."
39,"Gay men are much less hung up about height than straight women. 

Edit: also short guys are hot af and always seem to have the finest asses, especially if they're muscular. "
40,It's none of your fucking business what I call my hole.
41,"Personally, too much muscle is a turn off. Lean, athletic and toned is more appealing to me."
42,"I'm so fucking sick of threads like these. Who fucking cares, you'd think gay guys would be more tolerant of what others do in the bedroom."
43,"If this were me, guy #1 would just steal my phone. "
44,He's cute. I like Polish guys. There's a naked one in my bed right now.
45,Is it weird that I workout just so I can eat more?
46,"Closeted men aren't in a good place for a longterm relationship, and it's not worth the time/effort if you're out yourself."
47,"You should've titled this thread ""I'm a horny gay bottom who eats food""...ðŸ˜’"
48,None. I only sleep with straight friends.
49,"This ridiculous post contains 1,997 words. 1,997 words.

The longest essay I ever had to write in high school had a 1,600 word requirement"
50,"The greatest one I ever saw in-person was actually uploaded over the summer to... r/gaybros I think.

It was right when Pokemon Go came out. This guy made a profile for the Pokemon ""Jigglypuff"". It was total satire and said things like:

-  ""if you can't handle me at my jiggliest, you don't deserve my puffs""

- ""masc4machoke""

- ""No Dark types or Fairy types. Sorry, it's just a preference.""

It was hilarious."
51,"Few years ago I looked at someone and kept staring when our looks meet.

Yeah, I know... (ï½¥à¸´_ï½¥à¸´)"
52,The masc vs fem debacle... At the end of the day we all want to suck a dick Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
53,"What if I told the anti-LGBT business that I'm straight but my religion dictates that I have sex with men? If they don't serve you they are discriminating based on your religion. 

Now that I think of it, it would be fun to make this religion. I'm fulfilling the sacrament of same sex relations."
54,Keep your ass clean.
55,"Is ""x"" a turn on to anyone - answer is always yes.

Whatever it is, someone will be turned on by it."
56,"Yeah, this has me shook, detonated, triggered, and my ability to even has been severely compromised!"
57,"&gt;Does it still count?

depends on how smoothly he swiped your credit card"
58,"I used to bar tend at the local gay bar, which is where I met my current bf. I had served him a couple times and made a bit of bartender small talk but nothing substantial. Then one particularly busy night I was running to grab a bottle of something and he grabbed me as I was walking by and pulled me in and simply asked ""can I have your number?"" I was surprised and caught off guard and just gave it to him. When I was done he pulled me in for a kiss and let me continue on with my night. 
I figured he was drunk and forgot cause he didn't use my number until a week later. On Valentine's Day morning I got a text asking if I was free to be his valentine that night. Ballsy move asking the morning of but fortunately I was single and without plans. 
We will be celebrating 4 years this coming Valentine's Day. "
59,What about bucci?Boipucci.
60,"Might need to use this sometime.

I guess the only time I've been ""picked up"", I had a cashier ask for my credit card and scene card to swipe both through his register. Upon returning them, he read my name from my cards and grazed my hand when handing them back.

A few days pass and I get a Facebook message from the same cashier, asking me out.

Does it still count?"
61,"You need to find a proper counselor to talk to. This sub is a poor substitute for that. There are so many factors and issues involved when something like this happens, and the black-or-white advice of uninformed teenage geeks is not reliable."
62,"Ah shit. Guess I have to deliver now. It's like 9am and I'm not really awake so this is going to be unsexy and poorly written.  
  
We were at a mate's place for a hottest 100 barbie (radio countdown with decent music and dinner). After that my friends all wanted to walk to the beach for the fireworks and my partner and I didn't feel like it so we were alone.  
  
We were on the trampoline and my partner was fairly tipsy at this point and he started to kiss me and then he sits up all of a sudden and is like ""I've never had sex on a trampoline"". Let me be clear at this point that the trampoline in question has seen a lot of action and my friend does not have children. He's just an adult man with a trampoline. He also fucked someone on my pullout lounge so he had it coming.  
  
Anyway. I was into it. I am easily seduced. He is ridiculously hot. Trampoline sex is kind of fun but also painful. He accidentally headbutted me in the chin, but he did literally bounce up and down on my dick for ages so whatever. He's definitely going to be sore today.  
  
Oh and we could see the fireworks from the trampoline anyway. As he said ""this is all romantic and shit"".  
I should clearly never try to write erotic literature."
63,"It bothers me on an intellectual level but not an emotional one. This is, after all, the only dick I've ever had, and I like my dick. Now when my brother and friends start having babies, I'll push for noncircumcision. And I'll keep donating to foregen and crossing my fingers that their research is fruitful. I'm on their waitlist for human trials :) that's about all I can do, though. "
64,"A friend of mine got picked up in a few words: nod, hey, and want to go fuck. They started to go out afterwards, lasted nearly a year. The whole interaction was like a Grindr conversation in real life. "
65,"If you haven't already, tell your friend he asked you how to say his name in ""Asian"", so they at least know how weird they were being. Unless your friend wouldn't see why that was a little fucked, then get a new friend."
66,"I can tell you it means he has a need for validation constantly, and I hope you have a lot of time to devote, because this is going to end up being a more needy kinda guy, if that's what you're looking for."
67,[deleted]
68,Amateur. Cant stand fake moans
69,WAKE ME UP INSIDE
70,Now you know how straight women feel using dating websites / apps. :(
71,"That's why it's called ""cruising."" You would hop in your Model T and putter past golf courses looking for hearts floating out from a guy."
72,...so we stripped down to nothing and I complimented his chiseled abs while the sun glinted off his huge pecs. I could see he was becoming aroused and...
73,"I had a MAASSIVE crush on this guy at a coffee shop at my university. He was stunning. Found him on grindr, we chatted for weeks but never thought he would be down. He was way out of my league. Well one night he asks if I was down to fool around--could not believe it. I scrubbed down my entire body. He comes over, hot as ever. I pull down his pants, massive cock. Go in for a suck and it smelled like I was about to suck on a sardine. So vile. I mean I did it but I was revolted and couldn't find him sexy again."
74,Period blood isn't normal blood.
75,It feels right. Like it's a secret that only some people know about. 
76,"Two cents from an Asian dude - don't get too offended. We tend to pay more attention to matters that apply to us. Being culturally competent might not be some white people's priority but it's a great opportunity to educate them. As I always say - colonize the colonizers, one step at a time."
77,Clean your dick and balls before a hookup.
78,"Try to not hide yourself. The guy you will end up being with will love you and your quirks.

 I personally think it's adorable and seeing it is a conversation starter :p"
79,I get by just fine. 
80,"I totally fall into the bucket ""I'm 39 and things sucked for a while but I worked it all out"". At 30 I would have said all the things you did. I had a sucky job, losing my hair, no relationship, not really many friends. Today I'm 39, have a job that I like that pays well, have a boyfriend that looks like he's going to stick around for awhile, bought a house, I assume by 'have a family' you mean that I have kids since everyone has a family so to speak. I don't have kids and don't want any. As far as expecting to be where I am in life around 30 is where all of that tends to melt away. You let go of deadline and expectations and you just start living. Same thing goes for the type of man you are searching for. Priorities change, and your 20's self would consider it settling, but it's really all about you valuing different things in life than you did before."
81,My boyfriend is spooning me and his boner starts to stab my ass. Being unhappy is not an option atm...
82,The real answer is learn how to have small talk. You can find out a lot about a person through small talk. But that requires you willing to have the balls to talk too a guy. So learn how to not be afraid to talk to random people. 
83,"...So I killed her. My dad came out of the house in an effort to stop me but I reigned dominant as he has gotten a bit soft in his older age and I am in my prime. I have to say, seeing his squirming body become lifeless as I relentlessly stabbed him with a switch blade was a massive turn on. I allowed my dick to live vicariously through the switch blade and let my mind pretend the blood was cum. As he died, he pissed all over himself and this was way too much for me as that is my favorite fetish. Unable to contain myself, I then took off his pants and underwear and begin to insert myself inside of his corpse... "
84,"&gt;their hearty laughter 

Well this is a mildly disturbing image."
85,"This isn't really something other people can answer for you. 

I think it's fucked up and couldn't deal with it. He clearly is quite insensitive, even toward you, whom he should love. But you have to decide whether that's something you personally are willing to put up with in a relationship. Obviously, regardless of where things go, you should bring it up to him because it's something that is and will continue to bother you. Whether you want to continue to be his enlightener/educator throughout the course of your relationship is up to you. 

But you must have known his political viewpoints at some point over the last 3 years, no?"
86,"Sex should be whatever you want. Some people think like you. Don't just give up on your views, try to find those who think like you."
87,My taste in men has gotten so broad over the years that I have no idea what my type is anymore.
88,this is the funniest thing i've ever read omg i'm caCKLING. 
89,i was walking to work and a bird jumped out of a tree and shrieked at me and i was so surprised that i just shot a big load of cum everywhere
90,"I don't agree that marching and protesting doesn't work.  Look at the immediate effect of the nationwide protests at airports this weekend.  At least they walked back the ban on reentry of green card holders.   With regard to the rumored Exec. Order, it may be time to be heard (again).  It's also time to support the organizations that provide legal support.   Discrimination based on religious beliefs has been knocked down again and again in the courts, on the basis of equal protection.   YES, we will always have to fight for our rights."
91,"If anything, it will make the community more rebellious. This will produce a lot of inspirational LGBT art and protest movements."
92,"...Out of no where, completely unprovoked he kissed my soft lips and whispered that he's been wanting to do that for a long time now. Then he... "
93,Ok.. Let's stop
94,"Best thing I've heard all today, thank you for that. 

I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you. Clearly your skills are on point at least!"
95,"Your friends are assholes. he asks you to be his best man then tells you ""not to make a scene"" with your boyfriend? Fuck that. You were right for not going. I dont agree with being a dick to ""bro types"" or any random straight customers, and you certainly need to work on that, but you really need to find new friends."
96,"It's actually pretty passive aggressive for me. We fight for the blanket a lot, and since there is no ""the wife is always right"" going on for 2 men, it turns into actual fights lol"
97,"This will never happen to me for 2 reasons:

1. I won't have the courage to go talk to hot guy
2. I'd have to go to a gym"
98,I will never eat bbq sauce again. 
99,Oh dear God.
100,"there might have been a certain clothing optional bar in key west that i got nude in and let some guy blow me on a bar stool before being asked to leave.

there also might have been a certain bar in san francisco that i once put my ankles behind my ears and let some guy enjoy an all you can eat buffet, for everyone to watch in plain sight."
101,Definitely nerves. Trying to cum is when it's most difficult.
102,Must have as  pulse
103,"Dude, have a cry and sob over this tonight. 

Tomorrow, pick yourself up, look in the mirror and tell yourself it's time to grow up. 

You can still have most of that. Dating, mix tapes, awkward meals, etc. YUP!

Kids, picket fences, marriages, and so on? Yup. 

You aren't going to have to embrace your sexuality but let me tell you. You are gay. Nothing you can do from being angry to crying is going to change that. Stop wasting the energy on the thought. 

Tomorrow, pity party is over. You can have the life you imagined almost entirely. It isn't easy, it isn't easy for straight folks. You can do it but you have to start with the first step. 

May I suggest the first step is accepting yourself as is. Find a counselor. Just take that first step. Then another. Then another. "
104,Hope you never find him again you vain cunt. 
105,"I'm perfectly fine with the ""gay voice"".  It's the bitchiness attitude that it usually comes with it that turns me off."
106,"It's too late, my popcorn is ready."
107,"People act like it's rocket science. And you are in med school for fucks sake, lol :D Chillax, most people find it cute. Some will be irritated but most guys don't mind. And as I said, it's nothing. I assume you masturbate? Do it for him. Take his dick in your mouth. Let him fuck you or fuck him. You want to stop? Tell him so.

You'll figure it out and most guys have no problem helping you with it."
108,"When I was very small 6-8. I heard on the news how a Dutch male government official (might be even prime minister) got married to his boyfriend and I was so excited that boys could marry boys.


Now looking back I guess that was the first time I imagined myself marrying a boy and was happy that it was possible."
109,Oh yes. Especially with a little fur on. God I love short shorts.

121,"Don't be nasty to your own tribe. I hate it when gay people find some excuse to belittle other gay people for being ""too gay"" . "
122,They wish.
123,#bussy
124,"My biggest issue is ""Looking for friends...not fats, fems, blacks or Asians."" "
125,This is the realest problem people don't want to talk about. It's also why I am not that sexually active (because I will always pick food over boys)
126,Them assuming that because they raised me the only opinions I was going to have were theirs
127,"That moment when you look at OP's ""submitted"" post history 

Just a lot of /r/incel and pepe memes

How could such a wonderful personality have trouble finding someone?

(Lol jk, personality doesn't matter on grindr... it really fucking doesn't if your hot)"
128,"Best I've seen was Britney's song Lucky all done with emojis. Took me fucking weeks to decipher. 

I also like my own bio which includes ""apple users only #macs4macs"""
129,"Some of my straight black friends have that with white girls. ""Say something in African"" ""Do you know x other random black person"" ""Were you born in Congo?"" lmao A white girl asked me (thinking I'm straight): ""How many wives do you want?"" ""Did your mother already choose your wife?"" ... I guess it's not really out of malice, I wouldn't even call it racism. More prejudiced and ignorant. 

I'll usually politely correct them-even though it's not my job to educate them. And if people have an attitude, then they better pray they don't do that shit to some pissed off POC, cause I'm patient but not everybody is.

"
130,^goals 
131,"I always tell myself, next time...i'll taste it. Then im suddenly turned off when I try to. The mood just goes away. Snowballing is hot though. "
132,"Confront him in a joking way. It should clear the air.

""I know that you're masturbating. Why are you doing this? Why are you so egoistic? WHY DON'T YOU LET ME WATCH YOU????""."
133,"I'm not overly obsessed about it, but yeah I do wish that I wasn't circumcised. Would have been nice to experience it."
134,We are going to celebrate and throw a big orgy for all gay men... no women though. They can have their own orgy somewhere else. 
135,Stop defending racism. 
136,Patriarchy is the root of homophobia. The idea that men would give up male privilege and be vulnerable to being penetrated like a woman is what terrifies people attached to traditional gender roles. That's why they're much less troubled by female homosexuality. 
137,"Don't ever get into a fight with a drag queen in a bar and never get involved in a land war in Asia, it's a classic blunder."
138,"Not sure how ""smooth"" it was but I met my bf online in a mIRC chatroom about a decade ago now.  He'd entered the room and not much activity was going on since it was pretty dead(late at night) so he does an yawn emote.  I said something to the effect of, ""you'd better watch out opening your mouth here.  You never know what will fly into it.""  And that was it! lol  From that line he private messaged me and we struck up a conversation/friendship and eventually to a relationship about six months to a year later. We still had to wait another four or so years since he was in college for him to finish.  He lived in california and I was in georgia.  We eventually met up.  He helped me move cross country to California.  Id actually never met him irl til he came to pick me up.  Id figure after five years if he wasnt the real deal then Id just accept my fate. lol  He was the real deal and SO much more though. "
139,"Pretty sure more than half of the sub is fem lol

So whose you're favorite Queen on Drag Race?"
140,"Hate to break it to you, bro, but Grindr is real life. "
141,"WHO YOU CALLING ""YOU PEOPLE?"""
142,"If you want to finish with him tell him you're done with him because he is a cheat. Don't let him destroy you, he was a good actor until recently."
143,"Definitely, though it's nowhere near as much of a negative as being out of shape.  Competition bodybuilders are just a little too much for me, especially really vascular, shredded guys.  To each their own.

He's a total jackass for bitching about your body on the first date, though."

148,"Ahhh yes, I remember when I finally came out at the end of high school and just assumed, like an idiot, that the people I identified with, being one of the most repressed groups in human history and all, would be tolerant.

Lawls were later had in college."

152,Mistaking the end of the honeymoon phase with the end of attraction as a whole.
153,"&gt; In short, he doesn't really seem to care that what he says hurts me.
&gt; Recently, this has begun to bother me even more so than it did previously, and I don't know what to do. Any advice?

Seriously?  Does someone have to tell you to come in out of the rain?"
154,"Wow, I know this is cheesy, but reading these makes me tear up a bit.  I can see myself (or hope to see myself) in each post and I'm beginning to feel less alone.

Thanks to everyone who replied and I encourage more to reply as well."
155,Not really. Please keep your fuzzy butts.

157,"Sometimes I don't recognize myself in the mirror.

In the past 3-4 years I've gone from 130lbs to 162, and it's all muscle. I'm actually tremendously happy with how I look now, for the first time in my life. At 30 I'm in the best shape of my life.

And I didn't do anything extreme either, just kept a routine at the gym.

Now that I'm kickboxing though, already seeing changes 3 weeks in ;).

158,"People who attach too many expectations to sex are bound to be disappointed over and over again. Sex isnâ€™t always some magical thing that works out exactly the way we imagined it.

166,"46 here.  This is the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been, but it took a while to happen for me.  When I was 30 I was definitely not happy.  I had a breakup that ended a four-year relationship when I was 26 and I didnâ€™t date seriously again for another ten years.  During that time I just sort of drifted through life.  I worked a dead-end job and did a lot of random hooking up.  A LOT.  I felt like I was constantly crushed by debt and that I would never have enough to get a place without roommates.

Then a friend of mine got me involved in his meetup group which was for gay guys doing social stuff and it was not about sex.  I met my husband around that time though I didnâ€™t know at the time that he liked me.  We eventually started dating a year later.  We had built up a good set of mutual friends through our social group.  Our families are not super close to us because they all live in other parts of the country.  

Weâ€™re in the northeast so our entire state is gay-friendly and weâ€™ve never had any problems being out.  Professionally I am definitely not where I expected to be at this point in my life.  But itâ€™s fine since I would rather not have to work that hard anyways!  We bought a house together a couple of years ago and we have several pets.  Debt is manageable and we have a great relationship.  Being older has made us more mature and realistic in our expections.  There is no jealousy or possessiveness in our relationship, but there is plenty of humor.  We spend a lot of time joking and laughing with each other.  Every week is a new adventure.  Life is good!

167,"Aim before firing. Not everyone asking clumsy questions about gay people is a homophobe. They could be honestly curious and not be very informed or educated on the issue. Our numbers are low enough that people might have not interacted with a gay person much in life and you could make a big difference by being patient and kind as long as they're being respectful.

So, if a guy says something like, ""what about gay guys sharing the same locker room?"" don't immediately flip out over the clumsy question. Talk it out. ""Ok. Let's say you were in a locker room with all the women you know, but they would think you were a creep forever if you got a boner or got caught looking at them?"" Talking it out can help people see a different perspective that they'll honestly never think up themselves."
168,"...slid his hand down my body and cupped my balls with his warm hand.  I stretched out in anticipation, but at that moment from beyond the bushes entered fwb-ben.  Seeing what was happening, he came close by and said to my best friend ""you feel those big balls?  it's just the cock ring"".  My friend pauses, looked at ben, and then....

170,"I'm not, mostly because i'm 17."
171,"&gt;We have one straight sister, but we don't talk about that too much

Lmao, this makes it sound like you're ostracizing her for being a breeder. "
172,"You know how dogs sometimes have a spot you can scratch that makes their leg twitch? My partner has that. Except with his dick being touched a certain way. Always the left foot.  
  
He does not appreciate how amusing I find it. My cause of death will probably be asking him ""who's a good boy?"" in the same voice I talk to my dog in during sex. Worth it."
173,"I'm cut. It's a topic that I don't care at all about. If you're cut, cool. If you're uncut, cool.

I'm not holding a grudge or whatever against people. My dick works perfectly."
174,"Cis, white gay dudes will probably be mostly ok. Trans folks, women, LGBT people of color? Much less so, especially considering every cabinet member nominated or suggested so far is anti-LGBT. And the absurdity of answering this question with just ""Trump's fine with marriage"" shows the lack of understanding for all of the other issues on the table, like employment and housing non-discrimination, pending religious refusal legislation, healthcare for LGBT folks - specifically trans folks, and all of those other rights that LGBT people that go far beyond just being able to get married. 

(And even with marriage, lots of those rights will be chipped away  - see what Texas is already doing, or Arkansas - so that while we may be able to get married in name, it won't mean much in terms of equality in rights.)"
175,"Oh, you're just visiting? Well that's a different matter, you don't have to follow local laws if you're just visiting a country. That's why I'm allowed to drive as fast as like on Canadian highways because I'm from Germany and we don't have any speed limits on ours."
176,Nope. If anything I kind of like it. 
177,"I fucking love it when guys call it that.....

It's hot and you rarely ever have a bad bottom who calls it a pussy. Seriously. "

179,No he's not.  He's a beast that's gonna annihilate his little fuck monkey and give him what he wants.
180,Don't get so angry about stuff like this. It's pointless. 
181,"Love it in a private setting. If we are in public it loses its appeal and I get annoyed. Not a big fan of PDA in general, but there's certain exceptions. "
182,"1 but he is my only gay friend and we had a FWB thing in college. My husband on the other hand... we were at his friends house, one year into the relationship.

Was just sitting on the couch, with that friend and 2 others guys who are my partners friend and he suddenly says: ""lolz all of us have fucked your bf, are we eskimo brothers now?""

He had a lot to explain"
183,I was recruited. ðŸ˜‚
184,So he insults Mexicans and you're part Mexican? He clearly has no respect for you. You should just stop talking to him immediately. He doesn't deserve closure that would be paying him too much mind.

yes daddy"

188,"If a business needs apiece of paper to tell them to treat others with kindness and respect, then they aren't worthy of your patronage.  

Whether or not this law is in existence, these homophobes are discriminating against gays on their own free will, not because Trump, Pence or whoever told them to, but because of their own thoughts and feelings. They're the ones we should be fighting, not the law makers.

Homophobes need to be reeducated.  Homosexuality should be accepted because people genuinely accept it, not because ""a guy in a suit said so"""
189,I knew he was going try. He's already starting with the wall.
190,"His family isn't religious but his dad is very homophobic. During spring break last year I spent a few days over his place and the dad asked if I've got a girlfriend. When I said no he said to get one before people start thinking I'm a ""fag"". So I definitely believe his dad has something to do with it. Problem is I can't get him to understand when he refuses to talk about it"
191,This forum :p

193,I like that we can be rougher with each other
194,"Trying to win a fight.

Not having a shared sense of purpose.

Refusing to compromise.

Not communicating."

196,"In a school locker room. I was about 14 :) One of my buddies was changing for PE class and I saw him half naked and had this sudden urge to touch him at a certain spot. And this thunderbolt hit me - sooo, I'm gay now?! Epiphany :)And, the rest, they say, is history. Well about 10 years of denial, and then history...  but you get the idea.

197,I can't speak for others but that's cute af.
198,"I think you're missing the point, to some people being gay *is* comparable to things like down syndrome. That is what we should be worried about."
199,Literally just ask their ethnicity 
200,"My brother came out almost 14 years after I did, despite being 2 and a half years older than me. It took them a few years to really come to terms with and support me, but they're perfectly fine with it now. I was surprised to see that it took him that long to come out to them, we all pretty much knew...

But yeah, they don't care. It's just the two of us, but oh well."
201,"Can confirm period blood is WAY worse than poop, *shudders*"
202,"It's never been weird for me.

For me... It's been warm, cute and comfortable.

205,I think he has a right to be offended
206,Just gotta keep reminding people of this during these times. Even some LBGT people will never get it but we have to keep trying.

209,"When I was in college during the Spring semester I used sit in the huge lecture halls and stare down the long row. All I could see was a line of beautiful manly legs with a light coat of blonde, ginger, or brown fur. I got so distracted,"
210,"There is a world of difference between down syndrome and being gay. One is actually incredibly costly in terms of finances, time and effort to families, the other no. It is not easy to raise a child with down syndrome unless you have a lot of support from psychologists and medical experts and even the government so you can afford a carer or work part time. The two are not fair to be compared. "
211,I thought you said you had an insatiable appetite for BBC.....dayum gurl! 
212,"I would not... How about we try to realize that everyone is different and should maybe just ask if someone else is into it? Or at least respect someone enough to have a conversation about it if they didn't like something.

Not everyone is into anal. Doesn't mean nobody should be having anal."
213,It's called sarcasm
214,you're both right
215,"Prostate stimulation. I gave myself, my boyfriend, the pillows and the wall a facial. "
216,That's embarrassingly not normal.
217,"""Shallow jerk,"" ""stupid fag,"" ""arrogant and cruel.""

Sounds to me like he dodged a bullet. I wouldn't want to see you again either. ðŸ˜› "

219,"No, I'm just getting hard!"
220,When a woman is involved
221,"Just so you know, I am bisexual and find black women very attractive. This has nothing to do with race. Black guys are simply not very attractive to me, but there are exceptions. 

No one on this planet finds each and every person attractive. Generally not being attracted to black guys is not racist. If I were to say ""each and every single black person is hideous"", THAT would be racist. 

"
222,"You come to realise that gay relationships are in some ways almost easier than straight ones. Straight people are under such pressure at all times to conform to what society thinks they ought to be that they often have little to no room to actually express themselves. 

Conform to expectations of your gender 100%. Get a good job. Find a girlfriend. Get married. Have kids. Enjoy sports. Deviation from the norm will be punished. And worse, you don't even realise you're being manipulated this, because it's ""normal""."
223,I love it when you talk dirty 
224,"&gt;How come some women act like having sex with men is a chore?

IKR!

&gt;Why do straight guys enjoy being fingered by their girlfriends yet when they mention it, they get super defensive about it?

You know why. Because only gay men use their assholes for pleasure. ^/s (â—”_â—”)

Personally, I don't understand how they can live together without the same interests. Or at least I know couples like that. I mean, what do they do / talk about when they're alone?"
225,"Ya get creeps everywhere. This is reddit.

That's one of the biggest lessons I think straight guys - and the wider world, too - need to learn sometimes; guys *in general* - or even *people* in general can be creepy and cross social lines, especially when protected by anonymity.

I think women are more strongly socialized from an earlier age not to do that or not to feel able to do that, which does skew it in one gendered direction.

As someone who works with young people, there's a big number of times I've had to give young guys the kind of 'keeping safe on a night out' talk that some parents might give their daughters.

That comic where a straight guy is staring at a girl's ass and behind him, a gay guy is staring at *his* ass is a pretty good illustration of this. Guys aren't *that* different whatever our sexuality. A lot of it's how you're raised and what people around you act like is acceptable to do."
226,"True, but I'm fine with reasonable moaning. Super silent porn makes me feel like a creep"
227,"&gt; I'm glad to inform everyone that a few days ago Lebanon finally legalised gay marriage

I'm sorry to inform you that, no, it didn't."
228,"Getting tested, especially if you're a nympho"
229,I disagree completely. Blood is a minor inconvenience if you're prepared. Shit is shit. 
230,Get fucking tested and wear a fucking condom.
231,"Congrats, habibi!"
232,"Yeah, I don't want to have sex with a pedophile tho"
233,"Ugh, that sucks. I hate having to throw my walls out and replace them."
234,"I can also see why he would say that OP was being weird if he was just ignoring his questions. I mean I get that he struggled to articulate them well but he could have at least answered him. And honestly, if I date a guy who is of a different ethnicity, I'm kind of curious to know where his family is originally from. It actually could open up a good conversation on a first date if people weren't so weird about talking about that kind of stuff."
235,"""Does anyone else have my racial preference?"""
236,But can you tell me how to ride my boyfriend's 13 inch dick?
237,"First of all, know you can say *NO* at any time. If you are in the middle of sex you can still say it. Just be aware to respect yourself and that you are equal. Telling this because some people would be nice and shy if that's their first time and their partner is ""beautiful"" etc and continue even if they are uncomfortable.  Don't drink coffee or anything like that, don't eat before (couple of hours before you meet). I suppose you can't avoid eating with him so maybe just don't eat too much. Clean yourself down there, it really helps to relax knowing you will be clean. Don't do *anything* if it feels too much for you. It *shouldn't* hurt at all, maybe a bit uncomfortable. Take it slow and steady. Sorry for bad formating. Good luck!"
238,"For the majority of us who can't cum hands free...I usually just jerk off during or after. During is great because it feels the best, but it has its downsides: it's difficult to keep bottoming afterwards, plus seeing my bf finish is a really big turn on, and I don't get as much out of it if I'm already done. If he finishes before I do, he's usually out of it, so I just jerk off while he's cuddling me and/or making out with me."
239,Can confirm. Masks the smell of uncleaned ass and is nice and slippery 
240,"Some things are not for all people. Some people like sports and some dont. Some people like to dance and some don't.

If you don't like how it makes you feel don't do it."
241,"When one of the guys narrates the entire thing.

""You like me fucking your ass? You like my dick in your ass?"" We get it: you two are fucking. Shut up and focus.

When the bottom is obviously overacting and will not just shut up with all of the fake moaning.

Guys that cum TOO MUCH. Like an impossible amount. Like a super soaker of jizz. It's just not attractive because of how fake it looks."
242,Looking for malice and ignorance when not intended isn't really cute. 
243,I'm playing with my black dildo right now.
244,The trick for me is finding a another dude who is also vers. That has proved a little difficult.
245,Haven't killed myself
246,Don't be picky.
247,"It actually sounds like you have a good grasp on it. You can text him, or call him. I'd prefer a phone call but I'm probably in the minority.

I'd prefer casual. But I wouldn't ever turn down Italian, it's my favorite. Neither seems like a bad choice. Benefit to Italian, you can talk in the car and learn a lot about each other on the drive there.

You're a rural blue collar, but by his fashion choices it sounds like he is not. That means that all the things in your life you find mundane and boring will be new and fascinating to him. Talk about yourself, ask about him.

Good luck!"
