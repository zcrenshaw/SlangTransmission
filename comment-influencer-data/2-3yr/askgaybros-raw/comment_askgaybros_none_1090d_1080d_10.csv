0,"I can't believe this. A healthy admission of lust without ""He's perfect for me, I'll never love anyone like him"" or ""OMG HE BLINKED IN MY DIRECTION, COULD HE BE GAY?!?!?"""
1,Okay but in the unlikely event he wants head... you give the man head. You do it for us. 
2,I'm not going to explain that to a five year old!
3,"""A friend"""
4,I like having disposable income and free time.
5,"You're not remorseful that you cheated you're only worried your bf will find out. Before that you ""compartmentalized"" it meaning it didn't bother you. And no it wasn't a dumb fluke either.

If it was a one night stand I'd give you the benefit of the doubt but you consistently cheated and didn't care until this guy turned crazy. If he said fine ok and never bothered you again this thread wouldn't exist. 

Your boyfriend deserves better, you deserved to be dumped, not soely for cheating but for only caring now because you might get found out. You're not the victim here, you play with fire you get burnt. If you don't tell him the crazy dude will. I doubt you will be honest about how it went down tho. I wish your bf well"
6,"The problems occur when 


1.) People say ""straight acting"" when they mean masculine



2.) People believe it is a binary thing: you are either masc or fem and there's no in between


3.) And of course, when people think masculinity is superior. But I think the former two are more prevelant ideas



And while nothing is inherently wrong with describing yourself as ""masc"", I think putting it on a dating profile has the same caveats as any self-descriptor. Like saying you're ""chill"", or ""funny"". You wanna be able to show, not tell. If you say you're funny, then fit a clever joke somewhere. If you say you're masc, talk about what ""masc"" things you like to do. It's just generic and sounds like you're compensating whenever you ""tell"" without any ""show""."
7,"This happened to me a lot during college, it was really weird.

Somehow I, a 6'5"" fat engineering dork, managed to become good friends with several super athletic (very straight) attractive guys during college. I often became flustered around them a lot since they were all *really* comfortable with their bodies and always found excuses to be shirtless. Sometimes it got so bad that I would intentionally take off my glasses to stop myself from ogling at them."
8,"How the actual fuck are people willing to use other people's sex toys is beyond me?! 
It's not just totally gross, but it's also easy to catch something if it wasn't cleaned out properly. 
Just nasty! 
Buy him a fleshlight and a dildo for his birthday or something, for crying out loud. 
I hope he gets a grip and doesn't go this path he's started to walk. "
9,"Okay, your nephew's mother rejected him at 15 for being gay. His family says things about gays that has caused you to not formally come out. And you wonder why your nephew has no respect for his family? Three years later you brought him into your home and expected him to act like a responsible adult yet he's obviously spent the last three years stuck in a family who have done a pretty shitty job of setting a positive example. How can you not see the emotional and behavioral issues his upbringing would cause? 

I think there's a lot more to this story than you've relayed in your two posts. I think the problems are way beyond your knowledge and ability to rectify. My suggestion is, if you want to help your nephew, do everything you can to get him to counseling. "

She wasn't."

"
13,"&gt; boyfriend of one month

&gt; asking you to change yourself in a major way because it doesn't suit him

Thats a big red flag. He doesn't sound like boyfriend material honestly."
14,I want a goddamn hug.
15,"Sometimes I have like 10 conversations going at once, and it just becomes exhausting chatting small talk with so many dudes. I really just don't get attached with anyone until we meet in person. That's why I just let a lot conversations die off. "
16,"I once excitedly bragged to a friend that I hooked up with a really hot guy, way outta my ""league."" His response is one that always stuck with me, and I want to share it with you:

&gt; Dude, if you're with him, then he's not out of your league."
17,"Lmao you can't find attractive what you can't see, right? "
18,Would you say your virginity was *whisked* away?
19,"I wouldn't let /r/askgaybros down, I'd include multiple updates as well"
20,"""Help I saw a guy a naked in the locker room and I might have thought he was attractive. Am I gay!?!?!?!?!"" 

""I'm freaking out! I touched a hookups dick with my hand, but we didn't do anything else. He said he was negative, but I'm really scared, do I have HIV?""

""Would anyone here date a guy who's trans/hiv+/black/feminine/disabled/ someone with kids?""

What you said and all of this is askgaybros in a nutshell. It's actually kind of amazing to watch the pattern. You'll get a post about being attractive on grindr, then within a day or so 4 more threads pop up. Then you cycle to HIV scares, which cycles into would you date someone with HIV, which cycles into would you date someone with x trait. Sometimes you'll get a few gay conservative trap threads that pop up. After all of that you have someone who says askgaybros is a shitty place and generally after that the cycle repeats. Obviously it's not perfect, but it does have a pattern of shit posts. "
21,"""He says it's not about me- he likes me, thinks I'm hot, but just can't be romantic or friends with benefits with anyone right now.""

""And he starts talking about this other guy he's seeing and how excited he is about the date they're going on this evening.""

Wow that sucks, I can't blame you if you decide to end the friendship. "
22,I love that he gets a boner every time I touch him
23,"&gt;""OMG HE BLINKED IN MY DIRECTION, COULD HE BE GAY?!?!?""

Ah, college. "
24,Over-manscaped eyebrows 
25,"Yep. A girl friend's husband. I know him through facebook posts but not personally. I debated for months wether or not to tell her because we were pretty cool in high school. In the end, I decided to let Jesus take the wheel on this one."
26,"* Don't bring a friend.
* Leave your phone in your locker or in your car.
* Don't bring anything with you that you wouldn't mind losing. 
* Bring cash.
* Don't do anything you don't want to do. It's easy to say no.
* Keep track of your check-in and check-out times.
* Keep your keys on your person at all fucking times.
* Bring sandals.
* Make sure you're ready.
"
27,"My bf is this big strong navy man. But he's such a softie. I think it's so cute watching him and his muscle gay military bros watch *Drag Race* and then watch some football. It's so cute!!


Oh, and his massive tree trunk legs/thighs. "
28,"Saw my best friend naked for the first time. He had a HUUUGGGE cock. Or at least I thought at the time he did. Turns out, I just have a small cock. "
29,Not ugly at all but dog ears don't do anything for you lol 
30,"A guy I was seeing for a while told me ""You're really weird. You're unlike anyone I've ever met before, you just don't fit the pattern; you're unexpected and I like you so much."" I melted into his arms."
31,"another, smaller, butt"
32,"I mean... Unless he's currently taken, there's still hope. Bisexuals exist! Like myself. I've had ex girlfriends but I'm still all for some guy action!"
33,My freshman year half of my hall were sculpted Greek gods. And a few literally would walk to the toilet naked to take a piss. It was like a homoerotic fanfic. 
34,You're overthinking this. Just take the compliment and move on. 
35,"Anyone that says Bussy or boi pussy

Edit: bunt as well it seems x)"
36,"It's not that exciting. :P  I was super horny, went to the bathroom and saw the plunger, put the handle up my ass, started going to town...  Next thing I know I hear footsteps coming down the stairs.  I'm sure I was making a lot of noise AND the bathroom door was open.  I've never shut a door so fast in my life.

We never talk about it and I hope she never realized that I was sodomizing myself with her plunger."
37,"[A kitchen whisk.](http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/image/BedBathandBeyond/101410117339c?hei=2000&amp;wid=2000&amp;qlt=50,1) My whisk broke and before I threw it away, I realized how perfectly shaped the handle was. And thats the story of how a whisk took my virginity. 

Unfortunately, Le Creuset no longer sells this whisk. "
38,"I always thought gay men were tidier and more hygienic than your average man. After working here, I've learned this is not the case. The problem is not us, man. 

Douche at home, bottoms. Please."
39,Where TF do you think the lube goes?
40,"Casual sex hasn't interested me since early high school. I don't necessarily have to be in *love* with someone to sleep with them, but I have to at least genuinely like them, and that involves knowing someone a good while. I'm not going to go around sharing my body with strangers or people I barely know.

Plus, there's the whole STD thing to consider."
41,"It's sounds like he would have barebacked with you without telling you if you hadn't asked. You don't ask someone to bareback and just forget to mention you have HIV until they ask. I don't think it's your responsibility to spare his feelings, he already compromised your ability to trust him as a sexual partner and you have every right to walk away."
42,"Gay guys are a lot more open about their kinks because gay culture allows them to do that. There's a lot less judgement. If you want, you can have a dating profile where you talk about your desire to find a boyfriend, as well as your desire to be spanked. And that's fine. That's one of the big benefits of being gay IMO. You don't have to be shameful about this stuff."
43,Take the fuckin compliment dude
44,"That doesn't mean your gaydar is broken.

I have a ton of ""I was dating this girl one time"" stories."
45,Leave his broke ass at home and don't feel bad about it. 
46,"Wait.  You aren't asking for advice on how to seduce him?  WHAT?!?!?!

This topic sure is shocking!"
47,"When your vanilla sex is already subversive, you're more open about other subversive sex acts. "
48,"racism, even if it's not directed at my race.

went from great date to trainwreck with this one guy when we were standing in line for the movies and he started making super, super racist comments about a group of black kids who were in front of us."
49,"Fucking really? That's weaksauce on their part and I'm sorry it's sucking for you right now. It gets better. Find an LGBT club and get in with them.

Does your university have cameras?

I live in a very red state, so if this happened to me I would be scared. If you don't feel safe, make sure to talk to people on your campus."
50,Yeah I agree. He is a client at your establishment so there should be that client confidentiality. 
51,Every time I look at him and he notices me look at him he gets a huge grin. Also we have this silly way of telling each other we love each other by tapping twice. We'll be laying in bed almost asleep and I feel his foot touch mine and jerk twice letting me know he loves me without ever saying a word. We do it all the time and I love it. Kind of a secret code that no one else notices because it's silent.
52,Santorum
53,"I'm a scareactor at Universal Studio's Halloween Horror Nights. My role is to be cut in half by a giant buzz saw and play dead but all weekend I kept hearing ""Oh no, he's too cute to die!"" And ""No!!! Not Nick Jonas!!!!"" "
54,whats John Travolta actually like?
55,one good thing is that your phone's battery always has a long life because no one texts you!
56,"Two weeks later: ""guys i jerked my roommate off in his sleep is that bad?!?!"""
57,Don't forget meta shitposts about the state of the sub. 
58,T. Tea. Gay slang.
59,"Tinder to make friends, yeah okay. "
60,Plenty of people are attracted to middle eastern men 
61,"&gt;Like a traitor to the gay community

Ugh. Forget that bullshit. It's not a rebellion. Women aren't the enemy. You aren't sleeping with Darth Vagina. 

Also, fuck the Kinsey scale. That's a very convenient crutch people use when they are just coming to terms with homosexuality, but it is impossible to boil down human attraction to a single number. 

I can tell you right now that there's a girl I knew in college that, if she proposed it, I would marry and make babies with. This girl and literally no others.  I don't know why...maybe it was her snort when she laughed too hard, or the way she opened beer bottles by prying them open with drawer handles...

Doesn't matter. This isn't intramural soccer. It's not ""us vs. them"". Love who you love and your gay friends can fuck right off. "
62,Personally I find Asian guys really attractive. Every once in a while someone says something like this and I just don't get it. 
63,"Aw. This is a mixture of cute, creepy, and sad. I feel like you now have to find out where he is (if he's alive)."
64,"If you've had conversations so far, then you owe it to him to let him know, in conversation, that you're only 17. Tell him your age, and tell him how you feel and what you want. Then let him respond according to what he wants. That's how adults relate to one another, and you're already most of the way there.

It's possible he just wants to be your friend. Or maybe he wants more. So let him know your age, and that it's legal for you to have sex. Maybe he won't want sex at all. Or maybe he'll want to wait until you turn 18. Or maybe he'll just want to go for it that very day. You won't know until you find out.

Another huge part that's missing here is what you want. What do you want in this situation?"
65,"You're basically talking about guys who are emotionally unavailable, and carrying around a lot of mental baggage consisting of a smorgasbord of possible depression, anxiety, low self esteem, shame, humiliation.  Closeted guys under a certain age don't carry around the same degree of the above, but let's say above 24 or 25 then all that mental baggage just increases with age.  Anyone who is closeted into their 30's could very possibly be a head case, after carrying around all that crap for so long."
66,"The ""he could have pulled out"" argument is nonsense. He was nervous and uncomfortable already and your friend ignored his clear verbal no. Freezing up or just not knowing how to respond is common and doesn't mean he wants it. Your friend sexually assaulted him. "
67,"It's frowned upon and my bosses will yell at you for it but they'll turn a blind eye if it happens here and there. I've seen plenty of coworkers get fired for getting too friendly.

My boss once said that they're not paying us to fuck, if they were, that would make us whores."
68,"Insecurity is never attractive. Your self-esteem nose dives, you begin to dislike yourself, and people can smell that. You might want to focus on improving yourself (physically, mentally) rather than spend your waking moments with such a noxious cloud following you."
69,"The whole ""man trapped in a woman's body"" thing is a drastic oversimplification of what it feels like to be trans, and is not at all representative of the experiences of all or even most trans people. It implies that people are men or women because they ""feel"" like men or women, and that that ""feeling"" is something more than just our relationships to our bodies. Are there trans people who feel like that, who have an innate sense of gender identity that goes beyond the physical and tangible? Yes, there definitely are, but not all of us do, not by a long shot, and in reality the experience of dysphoria is much, much more nuanced.

Personally, I understand my gender much like cis people understand their genders. I'm male because I feel comfortable and at home in a male body. That's really and truly 100% of the reasoning behind my gender. Everything else just flows into/out of that.

What does it feel like to be comfortable in a body? Well, I think it's perhaps more useful to describe what it felt like for me to be *uncomfortable* in a body. It's a feeling of being completely disconnected from your physical self. I felt more like one of those head-in-a-jars from Futurama than an actual person: my body might as well have not existed, it felt so detached from the person I actually was. I felt like a brain floating in a bag of anonymous meat. I would look in the mirror and feel totally disconnected from my reflection – I knew logically that it was me, but it didn't *feel* like me. It was so disappointing to acknowledge that it was me. There was something *so wrong* about it.

Touching, looking at, or even thinking my female physical characteristics was unsettling on the best of days and horrifying on the worst of them. As an example, one of my ex-boyfriends remembers an event that I seem to have blocked from my memory: as a teenager, we were all getting ready to go in my family's pool. I went into my room to change into my bathing suit, but as soon as I saw my body in the form-fitting suit I had a breakdown and curled up crying on the floor. I locked myself in my room for the rest of the afternoon, leaving my poor boyfriend to try to come up with an excuse to tell my mom for why I didn't want to go swimming anymore.

I went through the world wanting to hide from it. I didn't like people looking at me. I wore big, black, baggy clothes all the time because I didn't want anyone to see my body and recognize that it was female. I legitimately considered/fantasized about converting to Islam so I could wear a niqab/hijab. I did everything I could to minimize my appearance. I eschewed any and all forms of beautification or self-care. I had sex with my clothes on, and refused to let my partners touch my chest - the only person who ever touched my breasts was the surgeon who removed them.

I did so many things, every single day, in an attempt to forget about my body and the way I felt about it. It's impossible to list them all. Everything from hiding from cameras to using my initials everywhere I could so no one would know I had a feminine name. I remember random shit I used to do all the time. Trans people do so much coping just to be able function like normal human beings.

Since transitioning, well, all of the above is over. I feel connected to my body. I like my body. (Well, for the most part. I haven't had sex reassignment surgery yet and my genitals still bother me a great deal.) I like seeing it, feeling it, taking photos of it. I feel sexy for the first time in my life. I want to be attractive for the first time in my life. I care about the way I look. I like shopping for clothes now! I want people to look at me, touch me, be attracted to me.

I don't feel like I was alive at all until I transitioned. I do not connect to anything that happened to me before transition – it feels like it was another person, like I just watched a movie about their life, so I remember what happened, but that it wasn't actually me in the frame, participating in the scenes. When I see old photos of myself, it's honestly surreal: I can't believe the person I'm seeing used to be me, that I inhabited that face and body. When I think about the way I used to have breasts I feel nauseous because it feels so *impossible*, even though I know, logically, that it was true.

Like I said, there is... so much nuance to all of this that cannot ever be captured properly, I don't think – or at least not in a reddit comment. But if you have specific questions I'd be happy to at least attempt to answer them to the best of my ability. I hope this comment was helpful.

p.s. - I just logged in to this account for the first time in a few months, if the person who sent me a DM with a ""just one question"" throwaway is still reading this sub, I am going to reply to you and would be happy to talk. I wasn't purposely ignoring you, I just only use this account very rarely and didn't think to check my messages. I hope you're still out there!"

They say your confidence is suppose to attract guys, has it worked for you? Or is it all bullshit?"
75,"Uh, no. I was in a similar situation myself a while back.

You made your intentions very clear: you were interested in pursuing something romantic. While you may be open to having a friendship with this person, it's kind of callous for him to bring up dates when he's aware of your previous feelings.

It sounds to me like he's confused and wants to feel wanted without committing to being tied down yet. That's on him, not you."

88,"I see couples often, yeah. Though they almost always go by without incident, we have had couples argue and physically fight sometimes—for various reasons, really—but a recurring theme is miscommunication about the kind of venue it is and the wholesome activities that take place therein, haha."

90,"I have a friend who was studying, or something, in one of the university's common areas. A girl comes up to him and asks, ""Can I sit here?"" He replies, ""Sure,"" then gets up and leaves."
91,The strangest thing he's put in his butt is his boyfriend's urine. That seems pretty straightforward to me.
92,Back when I was single I used to use those terrible apps. For the longest time I would tell someone if I wasn't interested and about 40% of the time they would get pissed and start chewing me out reguardless of how nice I was about it. You then have to have that arguement or block then. After awhile it stops being worth it. 
93,"Many guys will have sex with a closeted guy but won't date them. This is usually because the relationship will have to stay a secret and anyone looking for a long term relationship doesn't want that. They want to introduce their partner to friends and family and meet their partner's family. Having to pretend you all don't date in the presence of others would put a strain on the relationship, I imagine. Of course, it probably would work if both are in the closet."

Grow a pair, act as straight as they come, just so it hurts even more when you tell him ""I'm sorry, but I can't be the top you want. Instead, you should try fucking yourself"". Drop the mic.

98,"I'm not sure I believe the statement ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" 

However, he's cheated on *all* of his previous partners? Yeah, that would be a major red flag in my book."
99,Probably my dad's dildo. Yep he's gay too. I was 17 and horny and stayed with him every other weekend. He had two giant bins filled with hundreds of old school gay porn magazines from the 90s and DVDs which I used as material besides my usual downloaded images from kazaa. Deep at the bottom of the storage countainer was a box for a purple dildo. When he would go to church with his partner every Sunday (I'm an atheist) I'd fuck myself with it. Pretty fucked up but when you're a horny adolescent you do dumb things. I know he didn't use it though because it was still in its packaging and the box was covered in dust.

121,"I briefly, casually dated someone who, at the time, I thought was *way* out of my league. He was a 25-year-old engineer who owned his own house, owned six cars, had several very interesting hobbies, etc. In comparison, I was a struggling college student and only two years younger than him. I kept wondering, what did he see in me?

Turns out, not much. After a month of fun dates, hanging out or talking on the phone almost daily, and awesome sex, he sat me down and told me he wasn't interested in a relationship, which is completely fair. He then started letting his *true* colors show, and I found out he was a racist man-child who was just experimenting with me in between girlfriends. It's like he completely changed over-night. We stopped talking to each other completely not long after that, and I take a lot of the blame for that. It kind of messed with my self-esteem for a while."
122,"No, this has never happened to me, but this story is awesome and thank you for sharing. Maybe I'm shameless, but I would go back!"
123,Trans persons are treated like shit by basically everyone ever. Being told by members of their own community that you can't enjoy these facilities just sucks all around for all parties involved. 
124,"Haha good that you respect him and you're not setting yourself up for disappointment.

Had a hot roommate who slept in boxers.  I respected him too much and he got me into the whole gym craze in uni by making me work out with him. Wouldn't be where I am without him. 

Did I wish to do things with him at first? Sure, but I knew that would never happen. So I didn't even fantasize about him. 

People need to try to stop seducing the straights! 

They will come to you if they really want it and they will make the move! (Based on experience)"
125,"It actually has a very long, very racist history not just in the U.S. but in the ""Western world"" in general.  MTV Decoded did a [video](https://youtu.be/HS2jGfW5aOE) on it that explains the historical context pretty well.

Short version though is that it's racism.  Asian women are viewed as attractive for racist reasons and Asian men are viewed as unattractive for racist reasons.  I'm Latino and guys are attracted to my ""Latino-ness"" for racist reasons: they expect me to have a huge uncut dick and to fuck really well (I've got two out of three if I'm being honest.)  Just because a stereotype is ""positive"" doesn't mean that it isn't racist.

I lived in a few different countries in Asia for close to a decade, and I definitely find Asian men attractive (clearly, because I sure as hell wasn't celibate for ten years of my adult life.)  Because of that, I got labeled a ""rice queen"" which is offensive because it a) commodifies Asian men as a food item and b) misgenders me as if my attraction to anyone who isn't white makes me abnormal in the same way that so many people associate being a bottom with a lack of masculinity.

I could rant about this forever, honestly.  Again, long story short, it's racism."

131,"At the doctor's office before the testicular exam

132,"""No"", ""stop"" and ""I don't want it"" are complete sentences and should be respected when it comes to sex.

Second strangest would probably be a knife sharpener. Mom ended up finding it in my bathroom and was really confused."
138,"Worse than him not saying ""i love you"" would be him saying it before he's ready because he feels pressured. While it would be nice for you to be on the same page, people take different amounts of time to open up to open up about how they feel.

140,"&gt; Am I in the wrong here?

Nope. If he's upset that's on him, not you. You have every single right in the world to not want to take a risk (no matter how extremely small it is).

144,When I was in Gold I once dated someone who was in Diamond. 
145,"Awkward? No . . . only if you or the other person makes it awkward.

Completely unenjoyable? Yes. You feel next to nothing when receiving a blowjob with a condom on. The sensation is close to zero. Basically you feel warmth, and that's about it. Condoms are better suited for anal where there is much more pressure and tightness. A mouth just can't achieve this.

Also giving a blowjob to a condom is not very fun. The texture is weird and unpleasant and synthetic feeling. Really, it would be more fun to give each other hand jobs than to try to blow him with a condom on. 

The best way to avoid STDs would be to have sex with someone who doesn't have any STDs. Nearly every STD is curable. The only ones that are not curable are the viral ones, such as Herpes and HIV. HIV is pretty hard to transmit orally. It's possible, but you basically have to both have open sores in order for it to happen -- open sores in his penis and open sores in your mouth. You need some sort of blood or semen to infiltrate your bloodstream. This is just not something that happens with oral unless you're doing it terribly wrong :'D Like if he hides a razor blade under his foreskin or something and cuts your mouth open while penetrating you and then cums in your mouth. Then you'd probably get it. But only if he's positive for HIV.

Ask to see his test results before you have sex with him. I personally have test results and would gladly show anyone who asked. In fact, I'd make them look at them and ask if they had any to show me."

163,"Yeah, I do this alot. Many times it's not even sexual. I'm not even attracted to the guy cutting my hair. It's just the feeling of touch from another human being that makes it intimate. 

Us gay guys have it a bit tough. We can't touch other men because it'll be seen as sexual, other men won't touch us as they don't want us to think that there is something going on, and touching woman can be confusing to bystanders... So we don't do it. 

The end result is that we live a life deprived of human touch, aside from our significant others. 

What does this mean? When someone willingly touches us in a socially acceptable manner our mind kinda goes haywire and produces more endorphins then it reasonably should.

184,"You guys? Can't anyone respond seriously to this? I guess we all have a bunch of inexperienced virgins around here or something. Christ. Well, poor questioner, unfortunately, yes. 

If you don't go sit on the toilet to let the things like lube and cum out right after you've finished sex or after you wake up the next morning, it's gonna try to come out upon starting your day in the form of a messy fart if you don't remember to hold it in or go to the toilet sometime. Cum and spit will absorb after like 12-20 hours for me but lube doesn't and you must let it out under controlled circumstances or else you'll have a messy fart when you weren't expecting it that'll necessitate a change of shorts/underwear."
