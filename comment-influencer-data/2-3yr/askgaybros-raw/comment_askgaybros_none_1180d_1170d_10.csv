1,"Because the correct grammar is ""you're bi"""
2,"Straight guys don't do this shit, sorry to disrupt your fetish lol"
3,You sit her down and come out to her 
4,This is not gay agenda. This is just an excess of SJW morons in education. 
5,Tell him you're embarrassed by him and wish he wasn't a fool. 
6,Plot twist: actually super mature looking 17 year old. 
7,in 2.5 years have you ever...I don't know....talked to him and asked him to?
8,"Sounds from your story that he seems to have politely asked you out. A guy who can politely decline, who is now interested in you, is a positive thing. Give it a shot.

Really, there's no reason to be bitter about the past unless he was a jerk about the whole thing."
9,Am I going to hell if I laugh at this?
10,"I'm probably going to get down voted for this - But yes. I've volunteered and fund raised for sexual health charities. I have friends that have done so for decades. I have friends who have seen their whole community decimated by the AIDS crisis. (thankfully i am too young to've experienced it) But even that aside, we are living in an age of super-ghonaria and antibiotics that are on the verge of becoming useless. The comments on this post for me, are deeply deeply disconcerting. You can slag me off, call me a prude, call me judgemental. But it's fucking stupid, unhealthy and totally irresponsible."
11,You got played mate
12,"&gt;so I changed whatever I was doing 

Therein lies the problem."
13,"Turning into a cyborg shooting lasers from his eyes, destroying cities.  "
14,"Why not move out if you have all that money? Better yet, why flaunt the money to where they start asking questions?

Anyway, just say you've been gambling online or something and occasionally win extra money. Gambling like poker or casino style shit. Then change the subject and stop flaunting money  "
15,It's his sister's wedding. The Bride and the Groom get to decide what makes a good wedding or a bad one. In fact it might leesen the wedding for his sister if her brother isn't able to fully express his own feelings. Their mother is imposing her needs on them. She is banking on your bf keeping it to himself. Abusers rely on the silence of the victim.
16,No dont even. I feel violated. 
17,Here you go. A [massive dick](http://eveningharold.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6a00d8341bf8f353ef017eeacb1b2e970d.jpg).
18,throw him out. you're being used. 
19,"I did at my old job, we had a microscope and I wanted to see my swimmers"
20,"Yeah I'd get new friends. I wouldn't burn bridges with them, but I'd just move on."
21,"This person*

I will never forget*

Trust will never be the same*



Congrats, you answered your own question."
22,"To me, it's kinda like a sign of conquered territory, or showing everyone else what's yours. ""You see that cum leaking out that ass? That's my cum. My ass."""
23,"Stop buying shit. Some day the money will end, but if you save it now, you'll have less worries in the future. "
24,"&gt;  ""I don't accept you, I tolerate you.""

That is probably one of the most despicable things a parent could say to a gay child whether they really mean it or not. 

&gt; Eventually, he told me that we all say things we don't mean.

In general, that is true. 

However, it really doesn't seem like he is someone who is just making a few mistakes. He is deliberately repeating hurtful things. 

You don't make it clear whether you live with them, or how old you are now. If you don't live with them, then I'd suggest reducing your contact with them. If you do live with them, I'd suggest trying to move out ASAP. 

Living in a toxic environment, or even being exposed to it, is not healthy. It will affect your mental health which in turn will affect your physical health. Sometimes you just have to break free from all that. "
25,"Is ""water polo"" some new gay term I don't know about?

If it's the sport, aren't super-macho dads all about their sons playing sports?

OP, your Dad's a weirdo.  Just live your life and get away from him ASAP."
26,"*excessive facepalm*
I'm trans, I honestly don't give a fuck how the letters are arranged.
The only thing that irks me is when people start using those ridiculously long ""make sure we don't leave ANYONE"" out acronyms like LGBTQIAAAIDIFFJHGJSFHGETCETC. Once it gets to that point, just use ""GSM"" for ""gender and sexual minorities"" because it's an umbrella that includes everyone, and no one will get ""offended"" because you didn't specifically name their special snowflake identity.
Or, ya know, just use LGBT. Because people know what it means. Imo, it's more symbolically referring to all of us than it is to specifically and only ""lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender"""
27,"It sounds to me like you aspire to be someone you're not. You have a very normal life. Contrary to what you'd think if you frequent this sub, sex is not the apex of human existence. There are many things you can do and try that will help in breaking up the routine in your life. If you want to break from the mold why don't you take your own path and gradually, yet naturally expose yourself to various experiences? "
28,"Gotta give him space. He slipped up and entered a zone he wasn't prepared for so now he has to assimilate the event into his sense of self. He will either rebel and cut off ties with you or accept his curiosity and decide where the relationship will go next. I'm not talking romantics here, even a friendship is a relationship. The harder you push the more he is going to push you away. He has to decide what to do for himself. It's sad but this is the type of situation you hear about when people say I would have done this or that but I didn't want to ruin the relationship.

Here's what you have going for you. One,  he initiated so he can't blame you for pushing him into a place he didn't want to be in. Two, the friendship is old and established so it's likely to last.   Three, he touched you first, again him taking control shows that he knew what he wanted. 

Best thing to do is send him a text telling him that your here if he wants to talk that you really value yalls friendship and that you will give him some space. Then let him make the next move. Then hope for the best, It's all you can do."
29,"Trump has support from a variety of people, and a lot of them are racists. I genuinely believe Trump doesn't really give a shit about LGBT stuff either way and just panders to whatever people he thinks are listening and in a different world would probably not stand in our way, at least. But there's a big overlap in racism and homophobia, and he would definitely pander to a major voting block in his supporters- the racists/homophobes- over doing anything beneficial for us. I don't think he's particularly homophobic himself (given the context of how homophobic republicans can be), but he depends on and is willing to bend over for too many of them to ever be our ally.

Not that I really needed more reasons to not vote for him :P"
30,"Judging by this, it isn't his first time. 

He may be bi.  "
31,Not really. I prefer to know upfront whether someone practices safer sex.
32,"Because most gay people use ""bi"" as a transitioning phase to ""gay."" And gay people (for some reason) think it's impossible to like both genders for real."
33,If I am slamming you like a screen door in a hurricane you better moan like a underpaid porn stars. 
34,"I had a devil of a time figuring this out in my life.  My coming of age and coming out was violent and ugly.  My family's reaction savage.  When I got among a society of people who tolerate me it seemed like heaven.  I had no other frame of reference.

It took me a long time to recognize and name the feeling of void this entailed.  My lover and I lost years of our lives staying alone and spent on doing favors for those who only tolerated us.  When I finally figured this out I was able to connect with those who accepted me for myself.  

In my case I discovered the difference when I went to a gay friendly church.  I was astounded.  Not only did I discover human acceptance, and friendship, and love, but this new community insisted that God loved me as well.  

This is why I worry about the melting away of the gay ghetto in American cities.  There will be so very many gays coming from a background like my own.  Who will never see the difference between tolerance and warm acceptance unless they physically come into a community of like minded souls.  Hook up apps cannot replace what happens in a physical village, which has loads of rituals, and festivals, and events."
35,"You're not horny after you come, so the wanting to fuck women thing is fake and the wanting to fuck guys is real."
36,"It's hot because it's stigmatized. 

It's hot because it's intimate. 

It's hot because it's natural.

It's hot because it's dangerous. "
37,"Best advice I can give you: *Shit that dick out*

Sounds gross, but opening up your entrance as though you are taking a shit let's everything in so much more easily.

NB. Not advisable if you actually feel that you may do a shit."
38,A profile that consists entirely of a list of what they don't want. 
39,"What does the bride (your boyfriend's sister) have to say?  If I were your boyfriend, I'd tell my mother to go fuck herself, but you're probably better people than I am."
40,"A neighbor kid knocked on the door, selling school chocolates, and I answered shirtless, he just stared. He couldn't really get into his sales pitch. He just kept flubbing his lines and getting lost. He looked hypnotized. I knew then which way he was going to go. 

A few years later when he was in high school, he would hide behind trees in the park across from our house and watch my husband and me. (Half our house is glass.) I always made sure to kiss or hug hubbie when he was out there. 

Later when he was in college his parents came to us for advice because they were sure he was gay. We told them to let him come to them and come out in his own way and time. Now he's out and proud, and we're all proud of him. "

50,"No offense, but it's going to be very awkward for his parent to discuss sex toys with him. "
51,"He politely rejected you. Of course, it hurt you.  But keep in mind, he was never a jerk.  People are allowed to politely reject other people.  

Now that he finds you attractive, it's up to you politely reject him.  If you find him attractive, then treat yourself to some good man meat.  If you don't find him attractive, politely reject him.  

Don't make this some kind of movie plot where the ugly chick is now the hot chick.  Avoid drama."

56,"This.  I came out to my wife.  It was hard, but not that hard.  I don't think she was very surprised, and I bet your wife might be the same.  What emerged in the conversation is that my wife shared the things that she worried about, that she never told me.  It was a healing and helpful conversation, and huge weight off my shoulders!!  "
57,"While there's people who use dildos of that size on the regular, it's definitely not a starter toy. Hopefully, he has, uhm worked up to it... otherwise, yes there is always a risk of internal injury if you're not careful. Plenty of lube, warming up, etc...

As far as cleaning, as long as they are cleaned with warm soapy water immediately after use, you're usually ok. One can also use a mild disinfectant, but use caution because some materials are more sensitive than others and can be damaged.  Make sure to never use a broken or damaged dildo. And don't use silicone lube on silicone toys "

70,"&gt;I told my friend ""I'm not a prostitute..."" and he said that it's not like that.

Of course it's like that. You'd be exchanging sexual favors for material gain. 

There's nothing wrong with that *per se*, as long as you both go into the situation with eyes wide open. Just don't lie to yourself and don't do anything you don't want to do. "
71,"I like lazing around at home if I have the opportunity, so if my husband made enough money for us to live comfortably on just his salary that'd be great - I'd dedicate a lot of time to the hobbies I don't really get to explore with my current work schedule. Plus, I want to have kids and I want to be with them as much as possible (rather than leaving them with a sitter or something every day while I work).

I would like to at least get my Masters/PhD first so I have the opportunity to explore a career in the future, but I'd be fine being the house husband/dad "

Re: what you should be worried about:

0. These could be gag gifts. 

1. Self-injury. These can cause injuries which can lead to septic shock if he doesn't know how to use these safely.

2. Body-safe toys. A lot of cheaper toys are made out of materials that you really don't want to touch because it's an unregulated industry.

3. Privacy. This kind of toying is very involved. If he's rushing he will hurt himself. If he's doing it while he's home alone and he gets hurt that's trouble too.

4. Fantasy vs reality. While there are lots of people with fantasy in their sex lives (BDSM lifestylers, furries, etc) it makes life more complicated if he doesn't have a good seperation between real life and fantasy.

5. Appropriate toys. If these don't have a flared base they're not meant for anal play. There are other things he needs to be concerned about as well.

You might call planned parenthood to see if they have people who can talk about this in a way that gives him information on how to do it safely (rather than 'don't do it'), make sure he's buying body safe toys, make sure he's got the equipment to safely play with large toys, and wrap it up for you so you can hand him a gift card to go do what he needs to do to be safe.

I like the idea of a sex-positive gay physician, but they might be difficult to find and having someone that just says ""no don't do it"" when he can find people on the Internet saying ""yes do it"" wouldn't do him any good.

I can answer specific questions privately if you'd prefer. Also, asking this on /r/sextoys might give you better answers if you don't get what you need here!"
88,"Ooooh boy! I wounder what it could be!?
A penis! OMG just what i've always wanted!!"
89,"I'm so sorry. What a nightmare. Even though you created this situation yourself, it's what happens sometimes in a homophobic world.  I had a mate who was in the same position. He fucked around on the side, and then left his wife when the kids were old enough. By this time she knew anyway. This is one way to do it, although not perhaps the most honourable.

The honourable thing is to tell your wife, making sure she has enough emotional support to cope with it. Find out how she wants to deal with it after the dust has settled. (She may not want a divorce at all. She may simply allow you to fuck men on the side.) It will be a spectacular coming out, but maybe you can navigate your way through it with the assistance of counsellors.

If you divorce, continue to be there for her financially and be there for the children.

Or you can just leave your wife without telling her at first. But the thing is that everyone is going to want to know the reason for the divorce and they are all going to find out anyway after you come out.

"
90," Just looked at OP's history, he's 18 so hopefully ""half a year ago"" didn't mean you were underage. No wonder you're so non-discrete with your money, kids always love to show off. Honestly, your parents are just going to be really disappointed in you. "
91,"Then they aren't really your friends, bottom line. If they can sit there and talk about girls, and have an issue with wanting to throw your love life into the conversation, that's a major red flag. You need new friends."

116,"A few things to notice as I recall my undergrad years....

1. Denim shorts were very important in 1990. Particularly cut-offs with the legs rolled/creased twice. I loved my denim shorts like no pair of shorts since. I wore them for years after they went out, holding out hope that they would come back. But they never did. [God damn you all to hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPbjPOgRtyA).

2. No tribal tattoos or piercings. Tribalism is just about to break through, but it hasn't yet.  One guy is showing off his new tattoo and it's tiny by today's standard. Just five years later, you would probably see tattoo armbands all over. Barbed wire was particularly popular to symbolize breaking free.

3. No phones. Duh.

4. Tucked shirts. Once again, I keep hoping they come back. Fashion in those years was following the baby boom-- they outnumbered GenX and had all the money. When the baby boom was young and thin, clothes got tight and shirts were tucked to show the shape of the body. Then the baby boom fattened up, fashionable clothing got baggy, and shirts became untucked. Oddly, millennial hipsters brought back tight clothes but not tucked shirts.

5. America's obesity epidemic hasn't yet hit full-force. It's sort of lurking in the background. Middle-aged people are packing on pounds, but young people are rarely chubby. It isn't that all the fat people are at home hiding. It's that there are not as many fat people as today.

6. Hair gel, mousse, and blowdryers. 'Nuff said. Even straight boys used mousse.

7. I think fanny-packs might have been a new thing. Can't remember.

8. No beards! A beard was what that one boring prof had-- the one who smoked the pipe and put everyone to sleep in lecture. Grandpa had a beard. No young person wanted a beard.

Considering the fact that I don't want kids and the only family I am planning is one husband + maybe pets, there wouldn't be much for me to do all day besides the cooking and cleaning when there are no kids that need to be raised.

142,"I might just be a horny 20-year-old, but I cum pretty easy from just penetration - enough so that I often have to ask my top to slow down or I'll finish.  One time I came almost immediately (decent amount of foreplay), but wanted to keep going.  We kept going and I ended up cumming a second time just as he was cumming :)"
143,"You know who you are, and that's what matters. If anything, your partner should trust you when you say you're straight and not rely on stupid stereotypes."
144,"When you are considering electing a man to represent your country and other countries are having debates about whether to ban said man from their country, I think there are other, larger reasons to not vote for him than this. 

But you guys should remember, he is the nominee, his position is not yet guaranteed. "

146,"First relationships basically never work out, so you're in good company. Your job now is to just do things you enjoy and keep yourself busy, and be grateful you didn't live together or anything so this isn't messy at all. "
147,"This guy.

Don't give in to their bull shit and quit without another job to go to. Make them fire you. That unemployment check can be helpful."

151,"I fled to the United Kingdom from the United States. 

There is very little anti-gay bullshit in the UK, and if there is, it gets shut down pretty fast. I have rights in the UK that I almost certainly wouldn't have by the time I was 90 in the U.S. 

I am so glad I am out of that toxic country, and I never intend to return unless it is to see my abusers in court. "

154,Tell him he should have considered that his child wasnt going to turn out exactly as he wanted *before* deciding to have one
155,I wouldn't advise diving into a bunch of poles and holes just to shake things up. It's really not necessary. It sounds more like you just need to be a little more outgoing and try activities you don't usually do. Along the way you may meet a guy or 3 that you wanna get naked with. But to go from virgin status straight to high mileage just because you're bored with your routine may be something you regret later (not health wise but more mentally because you sound like you have a more cautious personality). Don't do a 180 when a good 45 degree correction is all you need
156,Fuck that. OP should suck hella dicks and not feel bad about it. 
157,If a guy won't show his face immediately I assume he's closeted and/or ugly. 
158,"It sounds as if he's pretty experienced at this already. Call him, it's the only way you'll find out what you want to know."
159,"A couple of thoughts:

It gets a little easier as you get older. The competition gets a little uglier and also the Real World smacks us around and we start to care more about things besides looks.

Also, have you tried experimenting with makeup? Not like raccoon eyeliner, but just a little foundation, contouring, etc, can go a long way. ""Natural"" makeup won't look like makeup, especially in a dark club. Ugly girls have been doing it for centuries.

And also, sadly, race probably does play some part. Just because *some* black dudes are getting action, doesn't mean there isn't an overall racist bias at play. Not sure what you can do about it, except to remember that it reflects on the ugliness of them, not the ugliness of you.

Lastly, dating is *always* a numbers game. Even if you look like a greek god, there are people who will think you are totally gross. But maybe your success rate is 4/5. If you are average looking maybe it drops to 1/3. Maybe for you it is super low, like 1/1000. That can be pretty depressing, but it also means that you just have to get rejected 999 times and then you'll find someone who thinks you are the best thing they ever laid eyes on.

I'll give you the same advice I give anyone who is trying to date: Don't tie your reward to whether you get a date. Tie your reward to whether you tried. Did you get cleaned up and go out and approach someone? Did you do something you enjoyed today in public? Give yourself a high five. That's what winning looks like. Don't worry about responses or reactions, just remind yourself that there are millions of people who are alone at home who didn't even try. That's what failure looks like. You're on the slow road to success, which means, at least for today, you did everything right."
160,Desperate and creepy.
161,"Holy god you are gonna have to either be the best liar or fess up to what you're doing. You still live with them, so ""my house, my rules"" still applies. They might not want you to engage in prostitution, and you're gonna hear to respect that or move."
162,"The FBI said yesterday that they were doubting the closet case angle now. (Towelroad article) 

They did not provide a reason for why they are feeling this way now, which is unfortunate.

I think the fact that we haven't seen ""I slept with Omar AMA"" or ""here was Omar's grinder profile"" yet, seems to me to indicate that people might have been mistaken about him.

In addition the Jacked profile turned out to be fake and A4A can't find a profile and is asking for users help is a interesting development. 

The guy from the police academy that says Omar asked him on a date gives me pause, though."
163,"A local gay venue has a little person go-go dancer. He's very popular. He is also jacked, so I'm sure the abs and all help.

Personally, I'm trying not to date guys much shorter than average (5'8''). I'm 6'5'' and if they're shorter than that I can't really kiss them when we're standing facing each other. It's weird but my dream apartment has comfortably high counter-tops and sinks, a shower I can stand straight under, and a toilet I don't have to squat on - that would also fall into consideration if I were on a date with a little person. "
164,Gorilla glue half of it shut.
165,"That wasn't just harassment, that's rape. If you want to talk to someone about what happened or about how you're feeling now, the [RAINN hotline](https://hotline.rainn.org/online/terms-of-service.jsp) has trained counselors for both phone conversations and chat. 

He may have tried to contact you because he honestly didn't think he did anything wrong. Many rapists convince themselves that their victims wanted and enjoyed the attention. Other predators actually enjoy their victims' discomfort and take pleasure in it, and contacting a victim later would be a way of intentionally further victimizing them. Either way, he contacted you because his thinking about the situation is twisted, not because it was in any way appropriate for him to contact you."
166,"This teacher/ student roleplaying thing where the teacher (for some reason) has a broken arm so his student decides to stay after class to help him out. Somw dialog, some nonsense, and they're eventually fucking. 

At the end, the student asks the teacher if he liked it or something along those lines, but the teacher replies with, ""Eh, I'd give you a C."" and it cuts there and I lost it. "
167,"I'm pretty sure everyone here likes the D... oh wait, different D?"
168,"The 'gay agenda' is a phrase invented by conservative think-tanks and later adopted into popular parlance to characterize the aims of LGBT advocates in a negative way. Common themes used with this language include that advocates collectively deny moral values, are intolerant of any opposition, oppress traditional political and social interest groups, and seek to make behavior seen as harmful and immoral normative in society. It is used to argue that LGBT discourse aims to indoctrinate falsehood using such logic."
169,I would be getting my HIV medication from the guards in prison because there is no way that would end well for him.
170,"I prefer GSM: Gender and Sexuality Minorities.  
  
"
171,"No, if anything it's even more reason to go. That's the whole point of pride, to show people were here &amp; gonna continue living our lives regardless. "
172,"Shy is not the opposite of confident. Perhaps it's the opposite of ""socially confidant.""  But a shy person could be very confidant in subjects that they know well. 

This may sound like nitpicking but what it means is that one way to interact with a shy person is to find the subjects in which they're confidant. Of course if they're narrow or specialized subjects, that could be limiting. There's a reason why my husband and I are both software people, and we're not the only high tech couple around. 

Some shy people are just nervous about first contacts. But once you know them you may totally forget they're shy until you see them interacting with others. 

And remember that being shy and being introverted are also different, though they often go together. 

Edit: typo"
173,"I don't douche.

I do make sure that I clean myself thoroughly in the shower, and if there's any doubt in my mind, I just won't bottom that night."
174,Whenever I was a kid in a department store I would always wander towards the underwear section and my sight would just so happen to go towards you know where on the models on the packaging. Like my eyes would gravitate on bulges of the muscled men in those tighty whities. I sometimes see kids in the men's underwear section and wonder if he's doing the same thing. 
175,"Just because you're gay, doesn't mean your community will accept you.

Source: I picked a traditionally progressive, very publicly gay arts college to go to. The gay community completely ignored me. I didn't fit in to the skinny, theater major, designer clothing, dorm living standard. Major bummer."
176,"Up until recently it was GLBT.  Honestly, I'm surprised that they didn't include more letters.  Then there's the controversy that A has meant both Ally and Asexual.  

I know this is why a lot of people want to use the word queer even though it has lots of negative connotations and history.  "
177,"I saw your  post showing the facebook chat, you pushed too hard and you really need to back off. It's not about what you actually thought/intended, or what actually happened in that room. What mattered was that the guy felt really uncomfortable, and you rushed to keep making him uncomfortable (ironically in an effort to stop that feeling). You gotta give him a few days and then apologize for making him feel that way.

Also, yeah it's kind of a shitty thought to have: you don't know what kind of struggle the guy had. Given that you're thinking about gay people in general, a -lot- of them had more than a little struggle in their life. Whether it's their realization/attempt at accepting their homosexuality, or home life, or school life, some people go through a lot of tough shit. While some may draw strength from adversity, plenty more flounder and fail due to it. It also seems to cheapen the homophobia that some folks feel as just something to make them stronger.

Similarly, I think saying that a small amount of bullying can make someone stronger is offensive to some folks. For those who went through a lot of shit, that emotional response is gonna cut off any possible rational discussion you would want to have. I should note that I'm not the against the idea of adversity to create personal growth. I just think you have to be cognizant about the emotionally charged issues folks can have.

Aaaand finally, those that you see strength in might have plenty of weakness or be putting up a front. LGBT community has a high risk of substance and alcohol abuse probably due to bad coping behavior. While folks might figure out how to act tough, that doesn't mean they're coping properly with the world and their emotions."
178,Missonary. I love to see my bottom's face while he's taking my cock.
