0,Get out now bro...
1,"Maybe when you find the right twink, they'll always be that 22 year old tight bodied slam piece in your eyes, even when they're old and 25...."
2,A man stretching so that his shirt lifts up and you see his furry belly. 
3,"Tell him no and that it felt degrading. 

*Communication*"
4,Bitch that cat trying to steal your man
5,"I'm straight, but I like reading stories of gay guys falling for straight guys (I totally understand it). I also like to show support since my empathy is through the roof; I'm not gay, you see (I'm straight) but I get the struggles and issues gay guys face on a daily basis. 

Oh and sometimes I watch gay porn, but it's only 'cause the guys are more masculine with bigger dicks, so it's easier to imagine myself as them while doing a chick, and the posters here say I can still be curious but not gay (since I only do straight things otherwise).

Anyway, I'm straight and I browse this sub. Upvotes to the left. "
6,"Any kind of physical contact with someone I'm attracted to will do it, even so much as a friendly pat on the back. There are a few people I maintain particular physical boundaries with for that reason."
7,"Hey gay bros. straight guy here. I read so I can be a better bro to my gay friends. I like have a broader understanding of what gay guys struggle with, enjoy, get down about, experience, and our similarities and differences. I feel like a guest In someone else's house and hopefully never overstay my welcome. "
8,"Your ex is a asshole. 

You're better off. You'll find someone who will appreciate and respect you. Don't beat yourself up on it. The best revenge is to get back on your feet and allow yourself to find happiness. 

"
9,thoughts and prayers... 
10,"My brother sometimes reads this sub, he says it's to give him a wider understanding of my life and those around him who are gay."
11,"Maybe you were the catalyst to get him to come out. You leaving made him realize he needed to come out. Rather than go back to you though, he either decided to move on with life and count you up as a loss, catch another guy on the rebound, is pretending he's happy but misses you terribly, or he's actually got a cousin to walk around with and pretend it's his boyfriend. The possibilities are endless!"
12,"I would wonder where I went wrong as a parent that he had to ""come out"" as gay and hide it from me."
13,"I just go home and have an angry, pitiful wank"
14,It depends on what 20-somethings with daddy issues are into in the next 25 years. 
15,"It's one thing to ask your partner for help with your bills out of desperation and a last resort, but demanding you pay off his bill to show you love him, and basically saying that if you don't pay it off, you don't love him? That is completely crazy and very rude! I would be pissed! It's his fucking credit card bill, maybe he should have been more careful with his finances! I would seriously consider getting away from him!"
16,"When someone claims they're ""masc for masc"". I'm going to automatically assume they are a huge bag of glitter. "
17,Damn you thirsty. 
18,"Or when he lifts up his arms and you can see his pits, extra hot if he's hairy!"
19,Straight middle aged woman here. You guys are pretty supportive and kind which is a nice change of pace from a lot of the rest of reddit. Plus I like learning more about what you have to deal with. I'm hoping that staying interested in understanding other people will help keep me from watching Fox news and yelling at kids to get off my lawn as I get older. 
20,"I turn off all of the TVs, radios, and anything else that makes noise. Then I turn off all of the lights. My husband loves the TVs, radio, and lights to all be on. He wants a ""lived in home"" with noise and that is bright.

So, I enjoy the silence. Then I eat crap food. My husband is an amazing cook (he is a chef after all) so its my chance to eat just junk. Not junk food, but the crap food that sometimes you want. Simple Mac-n-cheese, or just soup from a can, or delivery pizza.

Then I sit quietly, read, and miss him."
21,"Someone shyly trying to make moves on me (touching my leg, etc.), the lead-up to the action is more fun than the action itself sometimes."
22,I thought you were serious until the second paragraph lmao
23,"My general rule: if they have to say it, then they aint it."
24,"Face is most important thing to me. Body, I'm not picky. Been with muscle, skinny, lean, fat, and everything in between. I think for me it's about sexual chemistry and the mental aspect. So face, personality, then body. "
25,"So many of the people that start threads on this forum are, for lack of a better term, ""socally stunted."" Many of them don't have that social circle they could vent to or ask dumb questions in. Their brain is currently in an emotional hurricane and they just want some advice.

Don't be such a dick."
26,"When a guy is changing clothes and they put on a long button-up shirt or a football jersey on first with nothing else on yet. That transitional ""shirt on, pants off"" look honestly gets me every time

Also, sucking on my earlobes"
27,"I would say ""Get in loser, we're going shopping.""

All jokes aside, I would love him/her with all my heart. Just like how my mom loves me. They would still be my little one no matter what. "
28,"According to this same topic in the past, the mass majority answer is ""yes."" "
29,"Just a guess here. You said he made some derogatory comments about gay people in the past. Maybe now that a friend of his has come out, he's realized he was wrong, which has lead to him overcompensating. The whole, ""I'll smash their face,"" comment would be a red flag for that theory, in my view."
30,"He's your father, if he says that about a stranger, what does he think about you?

That's the fear many gays in conservative households have. :( "
31,"So it turned you on at the time but now you feel humiliated? You shouldn't. It was a fantasy you both enjoyed acting out in a safe consensual way. If you had really seriously told him to stop, and that you weren't enjoying it or he was hurting you seriously, he would have stopped right? You were *playing* at being dominated - *choosing* to submit. You were still in control. Human beings are really complicated - we have dark corners of our imaginations some would argue it can be healthy to explore. It's a game - it's there for you to play with if you want to. There is no need to feel any shame about it at all. But if you really don't want to do it again, then *don't*. You can't make the wrong choice here - as long as it's *your* choice. "
32,"""I'm praying for you"" is a polite Christian euphemism for ""I pity you"" or in some cases ""Fuck you, you're disgusting""."
33,"Well yeah but then they rest their head or hand on your bulge and what else is there than to get hot and bothered, right?"
34,"""I can't finish this, do you want the rest of it?"" - bf hands me the plate"
35,"tl;dr: you choose to date a closet case, then break it off because the closet is stifling. when he finally does come out you can't find a way to be happy for him despite your poor initial choice. "
36,It's not his fault that you dated a closet case for two years. 
37,"&gt;My cat is chill with him when he's here, but pees on his stuff when he leaves

No, your cat is not ""jealous."" Your cat is marking your boyfriend as his own territory. Cats pee when they are territorially insecure, because they do not believe something truly ""belongs"" to them. If your cat felt your boyfriend were ""his"", he wouldn't feel the need to over-own and scent mark like this. 

Also, cats don't always react to the humans in our lives based on *their own* observations. Sometimes our animals pick up on our subconscious cues and get information from *us* about how to interact with people in our lives. Do you feel insecure in your relationship in any way? If you could, would you pee on your boyfriend to keep other men away from him? :P 

Have you ever seen [Jackson Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatDaddy66)? He's the cat whisperer from Animal Planet, you should watch some of his videos on how to train your cat. 

Edit: Mine is the only serious reply. LOL."
38,"I married a rich daddy and built a wall around his room until the cheap fireplace caught fire and killed him.
Now I am wealthy."
39,"Because I've primarily been gay in theory, rather than practice.  My parents don't really need or want to know who my fapping fantasies are about."
40,"Son: ""Dad I don't know how tell you this....um.....I'm gay""
Me: ""Me too, so is your other dad.""
Son: "".........""
Me: ""What do you want for dinner?""
Son: ""Pork chop.""
Me: ""That's my boy."""
41,"First off dont do conversion therapy. Its fake and has been proven to not be effective ever. 

Second. Give her time. It took you three years to figure out it was normal it will take her time too. If she wants to talk to other parents going through this you may want to give her some information on a local pflag group. Just google them they'll be happy to give you the nearest group. 

Third breathe. You still have a home. Its a bit rough right now but this will pass. Youre going to live through this. Nothing made you gay, you just are. And you cant change that. For now just be you and live your life and do what you can to enjoy it. "
42,When you can see a hint of a bulge through sweat pants and you know he's not wearing underwear.
43,[Here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/08/11/the_daily_beast_s_olympics_grindr_stunt_is_dangerous_and_unethical.html) is Slate's Mark Joseph Stern's reaction.
44,As quick as possible...
45,"I used to live in a country where homosexuality, specifically homosexual acts were illegal; punishable by prison terms, homosexuals were looked down upon, called names, their property vandalized and the police stalked around gay bars waiting to get a drunk driving arrest.  Homosexuality was classified as a mental illness and beating up ""homos""  was socially acceptable if one 'looked at you""' wrong.  We lived invisible, striving to look and act  heterosexual and knew that we would lose our jobs if discovered.

Things are much different, now.  Not perfect, but vastly better..........I'm talking about the U.S.A."
46,"You need to start finding subtle ways to chip away at his own self esteem/body image. Subtle back-handed compliments, 'oh, your not looking so puffy today', 'did you change your gym routine? it's not really showing'. 

Start slipping extra sugar / salt / etc into his food and messing with his diet, get him as fat and ugly and pathetic and low-self esteem as you are."
47,"""My son is dead. I'm glad your father isn't alive to hear this. He's crying in his grave.""

edit : lol @ downvotes. sorry i don't have a happy outcome like everyone!"
48,"Compatibility is one of the most important aspects of a good relationship, it takes more than love alone. 

If you're not compatible with a someone (sexually, morally or whatever) then it's only logical that you may not want to be in a relationship with someone you're not compatible with in any way that's important to you. Relationships aren't about finding someone to change, but are about finding someone who doesn't need any changing. "
49,"Because I love having gay guys suck my dick, so might as well see what some of them have going on in life."
50,/r/AskReddit
51,This reads like a sad poem
52,"Every morning wake him up by touching his naked body with a hot spoon and screaming 'I LOVE YOU'

It's cute surprises like that which really show how much you care (and keep them on their toes)"
53,"You said yourself that he was the first person you came out to. The fact that you bared yourself emotionally to him and have expressed fear about other people, he might feel closer to you and a bit protective. "
54,sex so evil
55,I mean it's pretty big regardless.
56,"This man sounds like a horrible person. 

I read it several times and still don't understand the point of the article. Writing about people hooking up at a large scale international event isn't a news story or fodder for an opinion piece anymore: it's 2016 and this is widely known throughout the developed world. 

Who seriously fucking cares about how dating and hookups are occurring during the Olympics? That is the lamest topic of any opinion piece I've pretty much ever read. What a loser. 

He sucks. "
57,"I think probably a lot of gay people have wished they weren't gay at least at some point.
  
Idk how to put this. You want this impossible thing. You want to see the world remade. And it is sort of the smallest saddest way you could ever use a universe breaking wish.
  
Change only me. Out of all the impossible acts, change only me. It is the smallest gay dream.
  
You can no more wish yourself straight than you can wish someone else gay or *everyone* else gay. So why are you holding on to the wish that hates you the most? "
58,Eat all the bad food that he doesn't let me because he wants me to eat 'healthily' and not 'die when i am 30'
59,"No. I'm more along the lines of, ""I like you so much all I want to do is have sex with you."""
60,Short answer: sexism. 
61,I just causally stand over him with a knife to remind him that I could murder him at any given moment but have chosen not to. ❤️
62,"PG:

1. Seeing a dudes buldge through their sweatpants / bball shorts &gt;:D

X rated:

1. Eating ass

2. A guy eating his own cum"
63,"dude, relax. 

You did what two consenting adults do when they are attracted to each other. 

Treasure the moment. Sleep beside him, appreciate that you got to do something that you wanted to do. 

what concerns you right now is your uncertainty about the future. 

This is not something you need to deal with right at this moment. If you are in bed with him, then turn off your phone, cuddle and think about the future when it's the future. Not now. Come back to this post in 24 hours. 

Did you wait?

Okay, good. So, this is what has happened. 

You got to sleep with someone that you really liked, that you really think is sexy, that you didn't think you could ever do. That's cool. Even if this doesn't turn into something, you should take this as a self esteem booster. 

But what now, right?

Talk to him. 

Talk to him about what he wants. A simple ""Hey, I really enjoyed the last night, do you want to do it again sometime?"" will suffice for the first time. 

Once you spend more time with him, and if you feel that you still want it to go further, Then go the next step.. ""Hey, I think I like you as more then a friend... do you feel the same way?""

Always, always be honest. And take everything at face value - if you can.  "
64,I read Reddit instead.
65,Does anyone know what the clittorus is and where do I find it on my boyfriend? 
66,"Donate to Immigration Equality, a legal services nonprofit that helps LGBT people move to the States. "
67,"Let's put this in perspective: he hit you hard enough to give you a black eye, and now you're cowering in your house and doing your best to conceal the damage he inflicted on you. Forget movies - think about how this (literally) impacts you and your relationship. How safe do you feel?

This kind of thing is inexcusable, and I bet you it won't be the first time it happens, unless you BACK OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP NOW, your circumstances notwithstanding. 

Edit: I want to add that no matter what, I'm sorry you went through this. "
68,Sometimes I wish other people weren't gay. Because they are an embarrassment to the community. 
69,"A guy with nice underwear I don't mean fancy just fits him well and new. Or changing casually with a guy. Even if he's been my boyfriend for years. 

Another weird one is me taking a shower while the other guy is shaving or just hanging out talking with me. Kinda like the dorm showers. It's impossible for me not to get a random boner from it. "
70,"I enjoy it, but it's hard to find the balance between loving being naked outdoors but **not** wanting to be an exhibitionist, especially living in a crowded suburban area."
71,LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL single mother talking shit about kids needing both parents. I would roast this bitch so hard. 
72,"I get what you mean, sometimes cuddling and talking is* enough. But then he starts doing this thing he does and its all over"
73,"I understand your desire to help, but it really does no good to him to serve him petty lies about his father's happiness. Read: his father was truly unhappy about hiding his sexuality, but surely happy with his child. But know this: there's nothing you can do about it. Both you, AND your friend. Tell your friend that earnestly. 

Perhaps tell your friend that his father would've wanted the best for him, and your friend should move on and try to live the best and happiest life possible in honor of him.

Trust me, I understand your friend's sympathy for his father, but it does no good for your friend to grieve too deeply or long to the point that it becomes unhealthy. 

Best of luck, hope your friend finds peace and understanding in light of the situation. "

75,Big pecs make me swoon. Especially if you can see the outline of them in their shirt. 
76,"Singaporean here. Being gay isn't illegal, but gay sex and gay marriage are. Google 377A, it's a vestige of British colonialism. I mean, we're no Russia or Saudi Arabia, but it's not great. People in general, including the younger generation are largely unaccepting, and religious conservatives have A LOT of power here. 20% of our population is made up of muslims. I'm in the closet, and according to the people who know that I'm gay, I come across as straight so it's not too bad. I'll be studying in Canada, and hopefully will be able to become a PR so I can settle down there and be fully out."

86,I must be weird because hairy armpits are not a turn on for me at all. It's actually a turn off. I like it minimal. 
87,"I really wonder why the straight, married author was on Grindr looking, unless he tried bumble and tinder and no woman would reply.

Edit: Or he's closeted and trolling for guys while in Rio, someone he knows saw him and said something, and not wanting to be outed himself, he made up a ridiculous story about doing research for a story."
88,"I agree with Stern. This article was prurient, homophobic, and dangerous. "

90,I send him dank memes at 3 am.
91,Aww how romantic
92,"You feel he ""owes"" you an apology? Dude, no tea, no shade; get over yourself. I know it sucks dating a closet case, but you were okay with it for how many years? You should of broke up sooner if it was a big deal.

I have never dated a closet case, because I know I can't deal with someone who's not totally out. If you knew it be annoying, you shouldn't of dated him to begin with. Or if you really loved him, you should of hung on longer. 

You broke up with him, he doesn't owe you anything anymore."
93,"To add to your excellent advice, OP, read up on 'after care' in the context of bdsm. Rough kinky throat-grabbing name-calling sex can take an emotional and psychological toll, on both submissives and dominants. The dom can feel like a dick for taking pleasure from humiliating and degrading the sub (does not seem to be the case with your guy now, but thought I should still mention), and the sub can feel, well, humiliated and degraded. Some gentle holding, kissing, cuddling, **and talking** after can go a long way in addressing these feelings of shame, guilt, whatever. 

Rough sex can be intensely pleasurable if done right. But you guys will need to figure out what works best for you. "

100,"A bit narcissistic, but compliments regarding my dick. "
101,"Oh please. People suggest getting fit when:

1. Guys say they aren't getting noticed on apps or aren't getting dates

2. Guys genuinely have body image or confidence issues

Which are the vast majority of issues in this sub. This image is just facetious and juvenile."
102,Yes but not me
103,"A few useful tips, increasing in the effort required as we go down the list:

1. Hold the phone further away from your face and zoom in. The closer you are, the larger that cheap lens is going to make your nose look.

2. Consider your jawline when choosing the angle at which to look at the camera. The usual advice to pop your chin up slightly is generally very good, but other angles might look slightly better. Shooting with the lens below your face is generally a terrible idea though.

3. Most faces look their best softly lit by daylight from the side. Pick your location/time accordingly.

4. Avoid skin smoothing filters on your phone. They're always obvious.

4. Don't shoot absolutely straight on - experiment with composition (rule of thirds ect)

5. Now we're getting into things that require more effort. I'm personally not much of an instagram-filter person, but I'm not above making a few tweaks to the colours and composition of a photo - the trick is making sure that nobody suspects editing. The easiest thing to do is apply the famous 's-curve' using Levels in Photoshop or GIMP - virtually every photo looks better after this. Depending on skin tone, a slight reduction of green levels usually looks better too, and an even slighter desaturation of the background (vanishing slight) doesn't hurt either.

6. If you happen to have broken out/your eyes are looking particularly sunken, a spot of healing-brush work never goes amiss. Don't overdo it.

7. Carefully select your eyes and (using an unsharp mask) sharpen them very slightly. Select your lips and apply an extremely mild gaussian blur.

Needless to say, if you're doing anything from 6 onwards more than once in a blue moon you should probably seek help. However, for profile pics...nobody has to know.

111,"- ""Why are the homosexuals in /r/askgaybros always asking such impressively stupid, inane questions that could easily be answered by themselves with even the slightest iota of common sense and a minimum amount of effort? ""

(Read above about being socially stunted.)

- ""Why do gay males never learn their lessons regarding straight male infatuations or HIV prevention?"" 

Straight male infatuation is extremely common especially in people who are new to being gay. Considering that straight males are the vast majority in most peoples society, it's very common for someone who is new to understanding their sexuality to develop feelings for someone that doesn't share the same feelings. It's not so easy for people to flip off that ""switch.""

People are going to fuck things up at time, especially when they are horny. The funny thing about large online communities is you rarely hear the good stories. You're not going to get much, ""I practiced completely safe sex today. AMA.""

- ""Why is askgaybros so entirely devoid of any intellect, yet it has the audacity to represent itself with the Scholars of Athens painting?""

This is a open question because it's subject to personal opinion on what is considered a lack of intellect. People looked to scholars for advice on their problems so I can kind of see the metaphor. I wouldn't stress so hard or take personal offense about what kind of backdrop a forum site uses.

No, you don't *have* to do anything; there's no rulebook you need to follow here. Perhaps the alcohol made him lose restraint this one time so definitely talk to him about maybe never drinking again. It's a small investment if this really is the best relationship you've ever been in. But if it happens again, *definitely* leave.

Also, start making backup plans so you won't have to live in the streets. This sentence was so bizarre to write, btw. People in the States treat temporary homelessness as a bit of a hiccup. Where I'm from, all of one's life is planned around having a place of your own. *All* else comes after."
123,"Unless the author is working to get the athletes granted asylum in a more LGBT friendly country like Canada or the Netherlands, outing people whose lives would likely be put in danger is wrong."
124,"yup, women. I guess they are just jealous I get the same average number of dicks as them. gay men tend to slut-fame, not shame."
125,"Every morning when I get to work, I'll text him a picture that metaphorically represents us in a silly, cute way.

126,All I can say as a gay man is having a biological son would mean I definitely would be happy during many moments of my life. 
127,"I like cuddling, but if I'm trying to sleep, I need the distance. I heat up way too fast. Otherwise, I'm down to cuddle."
128,62 (embarrassed smile)
129,Easier said than done..
130,"Having a darker penis and bum is normal. Ever hear Blacks say ""kiss the blackest part of my ass"" lol. Don't worrk about it"
131,"Okay, I work as a cashier at a place not unlike Trader Joe's, and I used to be just like you not very long ago, so maybe I can help a bit with this particular situation. (be prepared, I'm very long-winded)

First of all, just assume that he is gay.  Maybe he is, maybe he isn't (though it is Trader Joe's, I know from experience places like that tend to attract more LGBTQ+ people in general, and like you said he seemed interested just based on eye contact), but it doesn't really matter right now.  Just assuming so will help give you confidence, and if he's not the worst that can really happen (at least in this situation) is that he'll turn you down.

Second, all you really have to do is give him your number.  He's at work, at least when I'm working I would never make any sort of advance towards someone beyond very lowkey flirting just because it would be inappropriate, so you'll have to make the first move.  How you go about that is up to you.  You could go through his line a few times and get to know him a little first, or you could just talk to him once and get it out of the way.  After you've paid and all that and are about to leave, just say something like ""I hope you don't take this the wrong way but I think you're really cute, so you should text me if you get the chance,"" leave a piece of paper with your number on it and walk away.  And then try not to freak out for the rest of the day (which is hard, trust me, I know).  Also maybe try to choose a time when he doesn't have a huge line, but it doesn't matter too much so don't stress about it.

As some others have said, seeing if he's on Grindr or something might also work.  I've had a few customers do this to me, even going out with one of them this week, so it's definitely an option.   Much less nerve-wracking, so you might want to check that first.  Either way, I think the most important thing is that you remember that it isn't a big deal.  Even if he's not interested, he'll definitely be very flattered, so there's nothing to worry about."
132,"So you're 6,40237371*10^15 years old?"
133,"Wanting it bad enough and practice, practice, practice is how it's done. There is no reason the two of you can't have fun practicing until you get it right. Expecting it to be perfect in the beginning or for it to always be perfect is a fool's game. "
134,"She just insulted all of us, who all also have parents, by acting like the worst thing that could happen to a parent is for their kid to be like one of us. She cast the first stone."
135,"""Ummm by masc do you mean mascara?"" "
136,"""Why yes, children need to be both provided for, and nurtured.  Two parent households are better than single-parent ones."""
137,Muscular calves 
138,"I try to act serious most of the time, but deep down inside I am cracking up. The silly noises and faces it's just too damn hilarious."
139,Out-Christian them and turn the other cheek. Take it as a gift and thank them. Then return the favour by telling them you're praying for them too. 
140,When (straight) friends are comfortable enough with each other to be physical/gay (floabw) with each other.
141,"Don't judge your own reaction. Meta emotion such as thinking you sound pathetic is hurtful to yourself. 

I thought I'd be 'on the streets' but managed to hide enough money away from my ex to be able to rent a room in someone elses house for a few months. A possibility? "
142,He must be incredibly insecure to try to feed his ego like this. 
143,[deleted]
144,Hitler would agree 😂
145,"I think of it this way, cute = my type, let's date. Hot = attractive, let's fuck."
146,"The Society of Professional Journalists has issued a stinging condemnation of the piece calling it ""journalistic trash, unethical and dangerous.""  [Link](http://blogs.spjnetwork.org/ethics/2016/08/11/the-daily-beast-wins-nothing-at-olympics/)"
147,"This is something people in this thread keep overlooking. In BDSM, aftercare is extremely important. It gives you a chance to sort of reset after things have ended. It reinforces the relationship dynamic is not the same as the dynamic during the scene. Cuddling, ensuring each other that they are valued, etc., helps with this. If OP, is truly uncomfortable, then of course he shouldn't go down that road again. If he feels it's because there's been a shift somewhere, communication about the scene and aftercare may help. "
148,"It sounds like he was making a joke?

You're probably just unattractive."
149,"Stop mindfucking yourself. And you had one great date. Relax, stop over thinking, let him know you had a good time, and that you'd like to see him again. I can assure you, he's batshit crazy in his own special way. Maybe his crazy is compatible with yours? Way too early to tell. "
150,The diagnosis is simple. You a hoe. Once a hoe always a hoe. 
151,"Well if they want it but can live without it and accept monogamy no, but if they insist upon being open than you can leave. Not everyone can do open, just as not everyone can do mono, but everyone deserves a fulfilling relationship."
152,My boyfriend is weird....when I go away he cleans...the freak
153,"Personally, I like it when they are stereotypically masculine but eager to take it/suck it. "
154,"No not at all. Scars are the history of our lives written on our skin. An always fascinating and fun form of pillow talk is the comparison of scars and the stories behind them.

I have a lot of scars too bud, not from the same circumstances as yours, but nonetheless they're there."
155,"I believe that being gay is more of a spectrum than anything else, and as the west becomes more open minded towards sexuality, we'll see more people on the more heterosexual end of the spectrum reflect on their sexuality that otherwise could have been repressed, so incidence of bisexuality will rise.

In terms of all of History, I reckon we've always had the same percentages, it's just varied how acceptable it is to live openly. There have always been predominantly gay people who would struggle to hide their sexualities."
156,"I think there is a comfort in hearing from others who've been in similar situations, as opposed to a doctor who is going to tell you very clinical information.

Though it is true medical advise from the internet shouldn't stand alone."
157,Cute ginger otters with beards. 
158,"I have sucked straight guys numerous times and I couldn't for the life me turn them gay.
So there!  Issue settled. Don't try to tell RickyBeannie that he's gay."
159,"&gt;not code for sex

Bring a condom"
160,"Yeah, I've got a guy right now who's becoming like this for me. I definitely enjoy sex with him, but sometimes he puts his head on my chest while we're watching a movie and I play with his hair and it's all I could ever need."
161,"How do you contribute to the gay community?   If your only interaction is through apps and clubs, you are only going to be exposed to the hook up side.  

Try visiting an LGBT center or volunteering at PRIDE or joining a gay sports team.  

Get comfortable with being a part of the community without the expectation of finding the perfect boyfriend around every corner and you will start to feel like a part of it.  It may take years, but you will develope friendships and perhaps even find someone you like. "
162,[deleted]
163,"So why are gay (specifically men) slutty? To give you a serious answer, because men tend to have higher sex drives than women, and when you get men together who are attracted to men over women...

That goes along with what seems to be a higher percentage of gay men vs. straight men who have alternative (relative to the status quo) views on sex. The reason for that? Being gay is already an ""alternative,"" so it paves the way for more of that outside-the-box thinking.

That's just the way I see it. And in my opinion, nothing wrong with it."
164,"I would say talk to him about the fact that you're concerned about your own inexperience, but don't make it about his experience. He shouldn't feel like he has to apologise for having a sex life before he knew you."
165,"Is he treating you differently? Is he being bad to you? Maybe he's just trying to let you know that it doesn't change anything when it comes to your friendship. If you're still wondering what he's thinking, ask him."
166,"Yes. Mainly because I'm asthmatic and second hand smoke is a huge asthma trigger for me. If being around you makes it hard for me to breathe, you bet it's a big turn off."
167,"Colloquially referred to as ""gay catnip"". "

183,"Yeah.. if I fall for someone really hard, which is mostly deep crushing, I tend to think about having sex with them a lot less. I do, however, think about making out a ton, which I think is just as intimate without being as explicit.
