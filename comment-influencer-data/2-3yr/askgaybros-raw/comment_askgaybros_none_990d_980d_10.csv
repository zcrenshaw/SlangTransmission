0,"This is conversion therapy. Please please please do not go through with any of this. It does not work, there is no scientific evidence for it. No matter what videos you see on this subject there is nothing wrong with you, you are not broken, there is nothing to fix.  You have no reason to doubt your own feelings which your mom couldn't possibly know.

You need to have a sit down with your mom about this. And if she still wants you to see a psychologist, it needs to be a real, professional psychologist not some church pseudo-psych. You are not selfish, this is your life not your moms and she needs to understand that.

Please read this booklet / give it to your mom published by the American psychological association regarding youth and sexuality. It is a very well researched and sourced booklet about why things like conversion therapy don't work and what is actually helpful in coping and understanding your sexuality.

4,"I found out today my religious mother outed me to my religious younger sister and her reaction was, ""what's the big deal? What's your problem?""

I love my sister."
5,"""I'm trying to be okay with it""

Why?

Why tolerate something that doesn't genuinely work for you and your needs/desires. I don't feel he's selfish but maybe just not sure what do to because he loves you. But maybe he loves you more as a friend. 

Anyway, it sounds like you really want to be with someone who can find you attractive and you can have sex with. He is not that person. So explain that to him and remain friends if that's what you want. I find it's important to examine YOUR needs and go from that spot. "
6,"Just out of the shower, I dropped my toothbrush on the ground and squatted down to pick it up.  Suddenly felt a tongue on my butthole, turned around and there's one of my pugs looking up at me with his tail wagging.  At least it was clean, I guess."

14,"As Tyra always said on ANTM, perfect is boring. As your boyfriend said, someone who is ""too pretty"" can feel artificial and untouchable. It's hard to fantasize about being with someone who feels too perfect for someone else to attain."
15,"Hi there,

I am leader of a subreddit dedicated to fighting against this - /r/LGBTsurvivors.

I can help you put a stop to this using legal means. I have been put through similar myself, and I know exactly how to assist you. 

I will not ask you for any private details, but I do need to know a few basic details about you, purely because laws and regulations differ from place to place. I would need to know your age and the state you live in, plus the state this ""therapist"" is in. That's all I would need to help you. 

I am probably too late, but if you are reading this, **PLEASE DO NOT ATTEND. RESIST.** I can tell you exactly what to do thereafter. Otherwise you will be exposing yourself to serious mental harm. 

**PLUS - you may not be allowed to come home once you are there.** They might lock you in for weeks, months or even years. These facilities actually exist - I was locked up in one myself. The fact that it is out of state makes me think this is very likely. You might not be back home later to update us - you might be a prisoner until you turn 18. Trust me, it really does happen. (YouTube ""Kidnapped for Christ"" if you don't believe me).

The video you've been shown is pure propaganda. It is not based on legitimate scientific research. Every legitimate medical association in the world has spoken out against it - even the Chinese! 

What your mother is doing is **abuse** and she **CAN** be taken to court for it if necessary. 

Contact me ASAP - my door is always open. "
16,"Way more lube. And way more prep. Also, it can get messy, and I don't mean poop, but lube, cum everywhere and sweat and spit etc. If you aren't dirty at the end of it, you didn't do it right"

He's so hot and popular, yet he's chosen you to be his boyfriend. That says a lot about you, and you should own it. "
18,"Remember: Real Life &gt; Virtual Life


You should talk to him in real life because the entire point of virtual interaction is to eventually interact in real-life, and here you are presented with a person whom you already know that has interacted with you virtually.

However, when you approach him, never bring up that you've talked to him on Grindr. Focus on the fact that what made you approach him was that he's a good-looking/interesting person. People want to be approached because they're interesting, and not because they were recognized on some app. 


 He's free to ask if you're the Grindr guy, but never bring it up first because it would seem like you're someone that only approaches guys they've talked to on Grindr."
19,"Friendly reminder: while these data are really interesting, they are not to be taken as representative of anything other than those who took the survey. We've got a pretty big case of selection bias here, so please take everything with a grain of salt!

24,"In his eyes, you're not his girlfriend, you're just a building block in his infantile dream of having a wife and being like everyone else. 

Either end this ""romantic"" relationship or officially make it into a friendship which it currently is already. You can postpone this decision all you want (for a year or five or ten years). Only then you'll have years of wasted life to be bitter about.

I'm sorry you got caught up in this, I really am. You're not the first one with this story and god knows you won't be the last. But trust me: there's a straight/bi man out there who's going to be affectionate AND crazy about you in bed. Don't deny yourself that because you currently feel somewhat cosy in life."
25,"lol yeah
    
It was this past Halloween and I was at a party. I ended up getting drunk and heading to my friends room (one of the hosts that I had a massive crush on) where I find him lying on his bed. I opened the door and looks at me and says ""about time you found me"". We start making out and fooling around while were still in costume. Everything is going great and it was the hottest hook up I've had in a while. 
    
Then the door opens.
    
One of his roommates walks in. Picture this: a Sriracha bottle giving a rimjob to a slutty SpongeBob SquarePants. He just says ""Yep, I approve"" and closes the door yelling ""GUYS ITS HAPPENING, WHO HAD MONEY ON HOT SAUCE AND SPONGEOBOB?"" followed by cheers and the occasional ""god dammit"".
    
They were betting on whether or not we would hook up or not and kept it secret from the both of us. Either way it all worked out and now hes my boyfriend."
26,I want the memory of reading this comment to slither out of my head.
27,"You must have had a really shitty Christmas if you feel the need to shit over other people's choices, and I truly feel sorry for you. I would consider that this type of bitter moralizing doesn't make for an attractive person, and the more you do it, the harder it will be to stop. "

29,"I was stationed overseas, and went out drinking with another junior officer from my ship. We had become good friends in the past months - we would work out together, go on long runs up a mountain together, and just hang out. 

Anyway, he asked me if I was interested in some girls he thought liked me. I said no. And he sensed a quiver in my voice. Asked me whats up. I said I'm gay.

We ended up drinking that night pretty hard with some chicks at a bar. But he decided to ditch them and headed back to my place. We ended up fucking. Worried, that things might seem weird - we talked about it the day after and he gave it some thought. Later, he came to the conclusion he's straight. 

I genuinely think he was momentarily curious when he met me. But I don't think he was, or ever will be gay. But at least he got to test drive me. The best part was in the cab ride back to my place. Making out with him was unreal.

we're still friends but live on opposite coasts.

edit: spelling"
30,"I used to work very close to my apartment and would come home for lunch. I don't remember exactly how/why, but I came home for lunch one day and, completely out of character for us, had a fuck session with my boyfriend on the floor of the living room. I was late getting back to work, but my coworker, whom I'd lost my virginity to years before, immediately figured it out and laughed his ass off. "
31,"Haha I had a similar reaction. Had no idea that it was referring to drugs and spent the first half of the post thinking ""a tad strong to reject someone just for that"" "
32,"You don't have to pay for everything

33,The dicks are more normal sized
34,He may be in denial or he may truly be straight and just like the attention. Some guys get an ego boost when they feel desired like that. Exhibitionists get off knowing other people are getting off watching them.
35,"And have a big meal too. My friend kept on getting drunk and having random hook ups (he prefers to bottom) and had a couple STD scares. Now whenever we go clubbing he eats Taco Bell beforehand and calls it his ""slut insurance."""
36,"You just described my relationship, so it is possible.

I know my boyfriend since I was a little kid. He's few years older than me but we used to hang out as a pack of friends and make our neighbors go crazy.

He was always very protective over me and he really liked me as a friend. He was the first person ever I came out to and when he said ""that's fine by me"" I was the happiest person on the world.

I wasn't suspecting him to be gay, tho he never actually had any girlfriend. Someday he got drunk and he become very... eager to cuddle with me.

We were sitting on the couch and he started hugging me, kissing my neck. I laughed because I thought that he's just that drunk to think that I'm a girl or something. I tried to stop him and I said something like ""bro, I'm not a girl, wake the fuck up, lol"", but then he looked deep into my eyes and whispered with sad voice ""please, don't reject me..."". Oh my god, that was too cute. We ended up kissing, even if I hate the scent of alcohol."

49,"So.... your immediate family thinks it's ok for your extended family to exclude you because you're gay, and they're happy to exclude you for that reason too? That's a deep cut right there - that's fucking mean. That's unforgivable tbh. "
50,"my favorite was when i was in the army and guys would talk about ""ugh what if a gay guy stares at me in the shower or something?"" and id say ""no one, male or female wants to see you naked, ever."" and they do a mental 180 and immediately say ""aw come on, im not bad looking..."" i agree with unsubtleninja, its a coping mechanism for something they dont understand, once they think about it differently (like in terms of them being attractive or not) they change their minds"

61,"Walked into the apartment and there he was leaning against the counter naked. Told him that I really wasn't in the mood due to sore muscles and a pretty bad day at work.

63,"Personally; I originally thought I was totally okay with being FWB with someone. I'm not. I want to be in a relationship. If someone tells me they just want to be FWB's, it's an immediate turn off. "
64,Very boring but most accurate answer: it completely depends on the individuals in the relationship. I'm in a monogamous relationship because it's right for me. I'm not judgemental about open relationships as they seem to work well for some. 
65,"Just go, people at the gym only care about themselves, or they're comparing themselves to others. As much as people think others look down on smaller or overweight people at the gym it's just not true and in your head.

76,"Nope, I'm so hideous that nobody wants me."
77,"I think we just had this post a day or so ago.

But I didn't respond, so my hottest would be a young new professor. Working hard, making a name for himself, but also new, inexperienced, and foolish about some things."
78,"Not surprised to see a post like this here.  You're probably posting tongue in cheek, but I suspect it strikes a nerve in a lot of people here, even if said in jest.  Honestly, if the percentages were close, it wouldn't make any sense seeing as most people who took the survey are probably from the USA, which is mostly white, and where asians make up only 5.6% of the population, strongly concentrated in limited urban areas. The percentage of asians who were born in the USA or strongly identify as culturally American is probably a fair amount smaller still.  

People tend to find initial attraction to certain elements of familiarity, who they see in the media, childhood friends, who they can relate to.  Asian Americans growing up in the USA are going to experience a similar exposure to white Americans/culture as other whites, while a vastly smaller population of Americans (white or otherwise) will be exposed asian Americans/culture.  That says to me that, aside from media representation, asians are likely entirely foreign to most communities across the USA.  

The idea of your ""ideal race"" is entirely built on the notion that race is necessarily a deal-breaker, or that it implies fundamentally generalizable compatibility/incompatibility.  People who highly value this sort of filter are probably not people you'd want to associate with (or be) anyway.  At the end of the day, you're going to want to be with someone who is willing to get to know you as an individual (rather than whatever your exterior implies), and at that point, it's a matter of personal compatibility.  In turn, it's only fair that we make an effort to get to know others as individuals in spite of socially ingrained biases.

note - I'm not trying to downplay or shame this aspect of the (gay) asian American experience.  I've lived with it myself.  I just think it's worth stepping back and recognizing a psychological head-space that will never provide anything but toxicity.  It's just like with depression - you can't control the influx of negative thoughts and cycles of hopelessness and anger, but you can have some control over placing yourself in the sort of positive environments that distract or prevent those thoughts from arising in the first place."
79,"You aren't dating a gay guy, you are friends with a gay guy. He doesn't find you sexually attractive and you have never had sex. He has no interest in sex with you and doesn't even find you attractive.  It seems emotionally abusive that he would even say that to you.

I'm confused how either of you consider this a relationship. It just sounds like you are friends. There has to be at least some sexual chemistry for it to be a relationship. You can continue being friends with him, but you should find a straight/bi guy to date who will actually be able to reciprocate your feelings."
80,"Glad you shared. This sounds rough, but it seems you're at a point where you understand the severity of the situation and you also understand how you reacted and the reasons why it was so negatively. You've come to a good conclusion. I hope you shared these feelings with your family members or even your father's husband."
81,"It always baffles me how in US hook-up culture ""partying"" means drugs.

In Europe the term ""chemsex"" is more frequent, and people are becoming alarmingly nonchalant about it. "

83,Correct. We all know redditors are a special kinda person
84,"Got really drunk with my roommate in Korea on his bday, we were like brothers up til this point more so than usual even for army bros. I knew he was gay but never called him out on it or anything cuz don't ask don't tell was still a thing at the time. So we're both sloppy drunk swapping ""I never told anyone this"" stories sitting on the floor of our barracks room together cuz idk drunk as fuck I guess.

He starts crying for some reason and won't say why just kept repeating shit like ""I'd be kicked out if I told ya"" (he had a super thick Alabama accent) or ""you wouldn't look at me the same"" shit like that. Eventually plastered me puts 2 and 2 together and I'm like..... one sec.... I go to my computer and dig up a mmf threesome vid I had on leave with a CL dude and an ex gf and tell him to sit down. Once he plops in the chair I hit play and it took him a sec but I can see the moment it really clicked for him what he was watching.

We sat on my bed taking turns swigging some Soju and me answering his questions about shit I've done. I'm not sure how it happened exactly but we ended up 69ing and me fucking him doggystyle til I basically blacked out. Next morning we wake up he crawls outta my bed and plops down in his bunk. I took a shower and grabbed some breakfast from the PX nearby then went back to sleep myself.

We never fooled around again after that but def became even closer bros sizing up guys when we were out bar hopping and shit like that. Til this day we're still super close and now he's been married to a great guy a couple years now he met after we were sent to different units."
85,"Having done both, girls are needier, more clingy, and need more attention/compliments. I find that girls are just more annoying and make things more complicated whereas (most) guys have more of a ""whatever"" attitdue. 

Most pertinently, straight relationships (again, most) seem to have a clear agenda: Date with the intent of monogamy, fall in love, live together, marry, kids. Gay relationships have no set rules or agendas. In fact it's hard for me to date guys sometimes (i.e. my current BF of 2.5 years) as I am somewhat trapped in that conventional mindset. Now I am learning it's OK just to travel and have fun with no expectation of marriage (yet still strongly committed) or kids/white picket fences/dogs. And not only am I learning it, I am loving it. I think we have wayyy more fun (on many dimensions) than do my straight couple friends :) We are somewhat ""open"" in the relationship and can do so without mass insecurity or all the baggage that'd result of the same in a straight relationship.

I'm a feminine black gay guy and I volunteer at homeless shelters sometimes and at food pantries and junk here in the Los Angeles area.

There was this lanky scruffy jewish guy around my age that I would always see at the shelter and I later found out he was bi and I kinda befriended him. One day I asked if he would like to come to my place and shower and shave as rescue centers are kinda sketchy which they are. 

He did just that. I then asked if he would like to go grab a bite to eat and something to drink. We did and we went back to my place and ate and drank and smoke weed.

Nothing sexual happened. He then slept in the couch on my living room and by the time I woke up he was dressed and said goodbye and apologized for freeloading which he wasn't. I then gave him a couple twenties and that was the last I saw of him. "
101,"I agree 100%. The colors are horrid and I think it makes even model quality guys look pretty bad.

It's also politically dumb.  We don't have to convince the liberals or the sexually liberated.  We have to convince the politicians who have conservative and religious constituents.

111,"My best guess: you're using too much water and/or squirting it in too deep. You don't need to completely clean out the pipes, you just want to make sure that the last few inches, where you'll actually be penetrated, are clean. If you douche too vigorously, you start to knock loose stuff from farther up the digestive tract and it just makes things messy again. 

In addition, you can't just eat whatever and hope that douching is going to fix everything. It helps a lot to get a high quality, high fiber diet and drink lots of water (staying hydrated makes a big difference) "
112,"Lose my virginity to someone I trust and care about. Kinky, I know."
113,"Okay, first things first. About half of bottoms don't naturally get hard when being fucked, but that doesn't mean they aren't enjoying it. Soft bottoms will have hands-free orgasms just as often as guys who get hard do. The only difference comes when they start stroking, which is when soft guys turn hard, but hard guys don't have to get up to speed. So if you're somehow obsessing about the physiology and psyching yourself out because your dick isn't hard, you're just sabotaging your own enjoyment. You absolutely do not need to hide your dick. Period. Second, you might just be too young to really be into the anal sex part. You might want to step back and stick to hand jobs and blow jobs until you feel better about the whole butt stuff. Getting your partners to finger you while blowing or jerking you can help with getting you acclimated to having things up your butt as well. Fourth, some guys never get into anal. They're called ""sides"", i.e. neither ""top"" nor ""bottom"", and they are a small, but definite aspect of the gay community. That may be how your sexuality manifests, and that's ok. So stop feeling down about yourself, stop being embarrassed by completely normal things, and maybe take a step back to truly explore and develop your sensuality."

There is nothing to overcome in the first place!  Your mom needs to realize that.  You're not abnormal.  You are normal.  It's her fucked up reality that thinks you're not normal.  She's doing what she thinks is best, but she doesn't know what's actually best.  "

Tom Brady is the GOAT. His political views are terrible.

I don't know if it's unpopular now, but it certainly was this time a year ago or back in May, June, and July among Liberals. Hillary Clinton's emails and dozens of scandals were going to hurt her no matter the opponent. If Republicans ran John Kasich, she would've lost the popular vote.

131,"Bi guy here. I can answer this from a first person viewpoint.  

With gay dating you can hook up on the first date (as the first date or right after you go on your date) and not have it be so difficult to do so. With straight dating (as a guy) you encounter a wall that needs to be torn down before you get to the 'I'm up for anything' place. This is due to a variety of things but mainly it's because women get bombarded with tons of unwarranted sexual advances and don't normally jump into sex (due to societal expectations, and quite possibly how women operate with dating/relationships - emotions, innate maternal drive, etc). There's also this outdated expectation that a man pay for a woman on the first date, and there's none of that heteronormative view with gay dating.  

When it comes to long term relationships it can be more emotional driven with women and more needs driven with men. I can't really generalize here because when it comes to relationships people are all over the board."

No it wasn't. This is how these things work. They take common experiences that lots of young men have so you relate to them and then trick you into thinking it caused you to be gay. This is complete and utter bullshit.

Guys, can we stop this, *please*. It's not helpful for anyone. There are no clear, set definitions for masculinity and femininity, it's based on many different factors. No one is better than anyone else for being more or less masculine or feminine than them.

It's ok to be masculine, *and* it's ok to be feminine. It's ok to be at either extreme end, and it's ok to be somewhere in the middle. Being one does not threaten the other.

Above all, **it's ok to want to be more masculine or feminine** and to be insecure about this as a subject. People have different views on how they want to be, and it's ok to try to make yourself closer to those ideals. It doesn't threaten anyone else, and you shouldn't feel threatened by it.

Whether you're ""yaaasss""-ing to RuPaul and painting your nails or bathing in engine oil and smoking a cigar, it really doesn't matter. **You can be, and aspire to be, whatever you want. Neither has inherent positives and negatives.**"

Lots of people will know exactly what you're saying when they read this. He is a type. He probably has a twisted idea of what it means to be gay for whatever reason and he projects his fantasies onto you.  
Looking at it from his perspective what you don't want to do is seem embarrassed or like someone he can victimize or push around. You have to seem strong without going so far as to make him feel too threatened. Some guys are really good at dealing with men like him. I've been in similar situations when I was younger and I tried to ignore it or avoid the issue but then it becomes a game to them. But one comment that is sharp as a knife will stop them. The thing is you're also going to continue to see him. It's not like dealing with a lecherous coworker. Maybe someone else can tell you the perfect line to say to him.   
Maybe telling him ""a story"" about an older man who always tries to hug you and how you think it's so creepy and feel sorry for his wife.  Making a big show of pulling away from him unfortunately  would embarrass your aunt and make family events awkward. Maybe telling him in advance, ""Next time we shake hands if you try to grope me again I'm going to make a scene and I don't care what happens.""   "
