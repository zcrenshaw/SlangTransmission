4,Y'all stay dating these teenagers and then are earnestly shocked when you find out they're immature.
5,"Straight friend: ""how can you be gay if your mother breast fed you as a baby, didn't you enjoy it?""

Me: *speechless*"
6,""" . . . and then 2 queens to share among us.""

Sounds about right ;-)"

Hit them with the, ""How do you know you're straight if you never fucked a man?"""
8,"My roommate: ""So, you like to put things up your ass right""

Me: ""No, it just means I like other guys, I don't even really like having anal sex""

Roommate: ""But... Then you're not gay"""
9,"Bullshit. You didn't **become** an asshole because you were treated poorly in the past. You're just using that treatment as an excuse to justify your current behavior - that seed of inner ugliness was there from the very beginning. 

Plenty of other people get picked on and bullied, after all, and DON'T treat other people like shit - the problem is **you**, not the way you were treated.

12,I like the entrepreneurial spirit of whoever asked that.
13,"I had something similar happen. A friend of mine was cheating, and it was a known fact to a couple of us in the friend group (friends through college and for several years after). His fianc√©e at the time did not know. We had expressed to him that he was being shitty. Especially considering his fianc√©e was in our friend group too - that's how they met, that's how it all got started.

Friends all agreed that it wasn't our place to say anything. That didn't sit well with me, as I'd want someone to let me know. 

So, I eventually decide fuck it, I'm going to tell her.

1. I'm no longer friends with those folks.

2. I was the bad guy. And this partially relates to how #1 happened.

3. Turns out he had cheated 30+ times, including with several of her female and male friends. He made a full confession when confronted.

4. They still got married. I was not invited to the wedding lol

24,"You have to remember that most Muslims that live in western countries are educated and modernized to a certain degree, they kind of have to be in order to migrate westwards but evangelicals live here, all of them both the good and the bad. The further you move eastwards the more homophobic Muslims tend to be. 

The middle east is a hive-mind enclosed in an echo chamber and buried under a swamp of religiously motivated bigotry. Shit like this doesn't fly in the west as well as it does over there so most western Muslims are more skeptical, therefore slightly more liberal."
25,"Define ""content"".  Are they censoring gay users in general.  Or are they just filtering stuff that's obviously sexualized as eye candy for gay men?

""I don't hate you, I just hate your lifestyle.""

Look, I'm a liberal gay man and I don't get the 83 genders thing either. But I do know what it's like to know that I'm different in a way that I can't prove, and can't be understood by the overwhelming majority of other people. I also know that if someone identifies as gender #42, it affects the lives of everyone else the same way that my homosexuality affects the lives of everyone else. Which is to say, not at all."

50,"""Old guy"" here. Stick with me in this:

You will feel less lonely and better about yourself by finding ways to meet these needs yourself.

What kinds things would another say to you? Say them to yourself.

Would a date treat you to dinner? Treat yourself.

Take care of yourself. Exercise. Eat food that makes you feel good. Do things for yourself. Care for yourself rather than someone else for awhile. As you love yourself more, you will want relationships rather than needing them. Bonus: you'll feel better about yourself and that will make you more attractive to others. People can see that."
51,"I had it happen once, but it was an outlier. He was a guy I worked with years ago who flirted with me a lot and definitely cultivated my interest. We started doing things together, and he kept flirting. Then, he needed to borrow $300, and, stupidly, I lent it to him. It turned out that he borrowed money from several people at the same time and then disappeared. I also found out that he had a coke problem.

I took him to small claims court and got a judgment in my favor even though he didn't show up. Maybe 8 years later, I got a check from the clerk of court with the original $300, plus 8 years of interest. I never found out what happened, but I suspect he finally got arrested for something.  "

53,"I mentally cross my fingers that it'll be different for him. That he'll figure it out and accept it sooner than I did; that his friends, family and teachers will be cool with it. That by the time he's my age, he'll see kids like him and not instinctively worry about them like I do.  "

62,"I'm white but I've dated a black guy before. He showed me some of his previous Grindr messages and I can't believe how many people can just...act like that. We broke up on mutual terms and we are still friends. Sorry you have to go through this OP, at least it helps you root people out. "
63,"He obviously wants the D, trust me you'll get drunk with him one day and oops!

In all seriousness, just ""flirt"" back and make him as uncomfortable as he's making you. "
64,"I am 5.3 inches, and 5.6 on a good day. I am way above the Indian average (4.03 inches), but we're talking about the gay community here. 

Anytime I send someone a dick pic, 90% of the time I get back, ""aww"" or ""cute"" or some other variant of that. 

Once a guy said that my dick didn't please him in the slightest, and to never message him again. 

But I found a guy who has a (slightly above) average dick himself, and he says he loves my dick. I think having a smallish-average dick has made me compensate in other ways. I have received compliments on my oral skills and kissing skills. 

Also, OP, there's always someone who likes what you hate about yourself. Don't worry, you'll find someone. And considering the fact that you're already attractive, I think many guys would look over the fact (or even prefer it) that your dick is 4 inches, just to be able to kiss you. They're out there. "
65,"The question you have to ask yourself is do you plan on having kids. If the answer to that is yes, you may want to seriously consider sharing a name. It is way easier to change your name when you get married than it is at any other point in your life.

I've been married almost five years. I didn't change my name, and now I regret it terribly. We have a son, and our son took my husband's name. 

I am starting the process of having my name changed, because dealing with programs, daycares, etc is a pain in the ass if you're a man with a different name than your kid. Sharing a last name is the easiest way to demonstrate you're a family unit.

I am the last surviving male of my family, but the family I have now is far more important to me than ""legacy""."

STOP sleeping with your friend for sure though... "
77,It's not that many gay dude's just a vocal minority. Most people on grindr are sexually motivated that's a more accurate representation. Sites like this are scewed to all the ones that complain about being rejected on Grindr and aren't comfortable with that lifestyle.

He shows up, but he's with another guy who must be in his fifties at least. My first thought was he'd brought his dad because he was worried about meeting a stranger or something. Nope.  
  
It's his boyfriend who will let me fuck the guy I was talking to if he (the boyfriend) gets to fuck me first.  
  
I don't really judge people if they're into older guys or younger guys who are legal but I got bad vibes off this guy. The younger one seemed very nervous and didn't seem to know my name even though I'd been talking to ""him"" on the app. So yeah. Old dude was basically pimping out his younger boyfriend so he could fuck more young guys he picked and then catfished with his picture."

95,"I was kind of a wild child, and when I turned 18, I'd make the hour drive to this little porn theater out in the middle of the corn fields. There was a gas station, a strip club, and then this place off one exit. And for being in the middle of no where, it was always jumping.

Anyway, I was out there one night, watching old grainy porn, trolling around, start getting frisky with one of the guys there. I couldn't really see him in the low light. We end up sneaking off to a video booth to do the deed. In the brief moment we passed a lit area, I recognized him as one of my dad's friends. I didn't say anything, and neither did he. We did the deed and he bolted. 

We saw each other again when he stopped by the house, both averting eye contact. "
96,"Her: ""Oh, you're gay right?""

Me: ""No, I'm bisexual.  I like women and men.""

Her: ""So yea, you like men, so you're gay, right?"""
97,"Yes, absolutely.  I don't take it too far though, and I doubt my straight roommate perceives it at all.  But I totally let him get away with things or do favors for him, simply because I enjoy his company - he's really cute with a nice sense of humor, and sometimes he walks around in his underwear.  "
98,"&gt; He then said he wished I wasn't gay, because we will never be able to be as close as we would be if I was straight.

That's probably true. You probably won't have the same ""close"" relationship with him as a similar straight male might. 

But you don't necessarily have to think of that as a bad thing. There are unique things that you, as a gay male, can provide to him in a friendship."
99,"Friend: But... You had sex with girls before, don't you think you're just bi?

Me: I was in the closet, so I did what I had to to keep the charade.

Friend: but you've flirted with girls before and found them beautiful, you sure you aren't bi?

Me: I told you I was in the closet, so I did what I needed to do to keep suspicions off of me.

Friend: but, I'm sure if you see a beautiful woman, you'll still do her right? Because you've had sex with them before and you must've liked it...

Me:... Dude, I'm gay... I like taking it up the ass. I don't wanna go near a vagina again... Eating them out was fun, though.

Friend: See, you enjoyed it, so...

Me: as in no longer. I'm gay. Not bi, not pansexual, not a phase... Gay!

Friend: so you're not bi, then?

Me: No! I'm gay.

Friend. Oh, ok... Cool! Let's go have a drink. You're gonna be my wingman.

Me: ... O-Ok? Sure... [Insert my flair]"
100,"Yup we were texting about a week ago just as normal.  I asked if he wanted to hangout after work and no response, so I waited two days to text him back and no resonse for another 4 days now.  Seriously fuck him that he couldn't get the balls to tell me how it is...."
101,"All the time. Sometimes, it ends in sex too."
102,"Choose whether or not you want the label ""gay"" to define you. If you want to protest for lgbt rights or be proud of the fact that you're gay and let the rest of the world know, that's awesome, more power to you. But if you feel like it's just another little detail about yourself, treat it as such. 

I was so afraid of coming out because I thought it would be a big deal to everyone I talked to, and to some people it really was. But if you treat it as no different then liking video games, or enjoying long road trips, the people around you will learn to respect that too.

Tl;Dr being gay doesn't have to be a big deal if you don't want it to be. The people that can respect either or, tend to be better people to surround yourself with."
103,"Everyone saying that it's none of your business is ridiculous. It's your best friend and your dad, of course its your fucking business! "

105,"First and foremost you need to be there for him. You need to allow yourself to get past any awkward feelings you have and recognize that your job in this moment is to be strong and supportive.

 He's telling you he wants to make up for it because he feels like he let you down . He needs your support to know that he didn't do anything wrong by not being able to perform sexually with you. 

Furthermore you need to let him know that he can choose to talk about this as much or as little with you as he wants . but explain to him that it's better if you know. Let him know that sharing with you will only make the two of you closer and make it easier for you to be there for him. 

Ultimately he needs to feel your love respect and support. This will test your relationship but it will also make you both better boyfriends."

115,"We tried going through an adoption agency but it was too expensive.  We looked into adopting through our state and met our first child at a meet and greet.  My husband and I both instantly knew the kid was the one we wanted to adopt.  We had been looking for a younger child, but this one was a bit older and had several medical issues.  The state at first tried to talk us out of adopting the kid due to the challenges we would have medically with the child.  We lobbied for the kid and eventually through lots of paper work and arguing the little one became a member of our family.

The state was so impressed with the progress we made with our first child that they contacted us about 3 years later saying they had another child who needed our help.  We had been open to adopting a 2nd but we never thought it would be so soon.  The 2nd child had been bounced around to over 30 different homes.  Kid had no sense of home and family.  We said fuck it, lets adopted this one too.

It's been over 10 years since we adopted our first child and currently the ""soon to be adult"" is deciding on which college to attend.  The other one, who was deemed unfit for school due to behaviour, is working hard to maintain a 3.0 GPA in high school.

Unfortunately both are in the dog house currently for getting in trouble in school and I have to sit down with both today to lecture them, so ya basically like any other family.

*EDIT: I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the kind words of everyone, it really helped put me in a better mood to handle the lecture later with my kids.  I was kind of dreading being the bad guy who has to yell at them tonight as its been a long week of late nights and this will be my first (and only) free night at home.

125,"Well, pretty much same here. I too heard my voice and couldn't believe it was me. I get comments a lot about my deep voice, strong handshake and masculine presence (last part is kinda engrained in us even if we weren't before due to my line of work.) When I heard my voice I was like wtf are they talking about. So this got me all curious and, well me bing the nerd that I am, decided to do some research. 

Found some medical journals and physicians talking about why we sound different than we thought we did. Apparently there are two reasons. One is due to our vocal chords being close to our ears it kind of distorts our perception on our voice. Then in turn we sound different to ourselves than we do to everyone else.

As for recordings, a lot of times they are unable to pick up the deeper tones in our voices and especially the ones that are associated with a mans ""deep voice"" apparently because the vibrations are not far traveled people hear those whereas a microphone does not pick them up. Unless you are speaking inches away from the microphone as well as it being top notch/recording/radio quality microphones. Thought all that info was kind of cool. And yes, I know, I'm a huge dork!

More generally, I'd suggest maybe investing your money in small businesses or start ups that need funding and see if you might wanna start one yourself. You have the time and money to do so, so you might as well at least try it out especially since most people aren't able to do that."

Can I be honest? Your hair isn't helping you. You're not at all unattractive but you look like you need to be introduced to a better barber. Right now, I'm assuming you get out of the shower and then do nothing but dry it? The beard is fine, could use a bit of a touch up though.

Consider posting in the r/malehairadvice/ to ask for some ideas on how to tweak things a bit. Nothing drastic or high maintenance needed man.

And even without someone helping, the best way to get a good picture is to do it outside in natural light with something nice behind you. Trees, water, whatever. Something nearby is worthy I'm sure. It has less of the forced stiffness of a selfie in your room.

Hope that helps. Again, you're not at all unattractive, so I hope that it doesn't seem like that based on this. :) 

Good luck!"
140,"My ex (7 years) wasn't out to his patients, so if we ran into them in random places like Whole Foods or something, he just introduced me by my name.

I dated a couple of guys who weren't out at work or to their families.  Both were fine.  We played ""friends"" around the family or in the rare event we ran into work associates.  

With the first closeted guy I dated, it was actually kind of fun going to dinner at the 85 year old grandmother's house.  She loved having us, and we loved going there once a week, and always went together.  She played along about the ""friends"" thing but she totally knew what was up.  How many 30 year old guys go to visit grandma with another 30 year old guy every time?

148,"Quick story:  Just a few months ago a really annoying coworker wouldn't stop talking to me while I was trying to concentrate on doing all my change of shift stuff.  Apparently she knew my brother in high school, and she kept on telling me how she thinks he's gay.  For context, the brother in question happens to be thin, effete, a little bit feminine, and hopelessly straight.  Between her bothering me and trying to out my (not gay) brother I got pissed, I turned to her and said ""I'm pretty sure I'm the only cocksucker in the family, now will you kindly shut up and go away.""  Girl looked like I slapped her.

Anyway, the point of that story is that sometimes shoving someone's face in it feels damn good.

173,"I think straight guys who are self aware of their own attractiveness will know they could have that kind of power. They aren't dumb. All it'd take is them not being homophobic to take advantage of it. Simply asking a gay friend they know is into them for favors like rides and helping them move and other similar things that would count as taking advantage and knowing the guy will most likely say yes even if it inconveniences him doesn't require the straight guy to let down any heteronormative barriers. Unless the straight guy is actively flirting back with the gay guy and pretending to be sexually or romantically interested in the gay guy as a tactic to keep him wrapped around his finger, then yeah that's next level manipulation for a straight guy and most wouldn't go that far lol. At least the way i took the OP, that's not what he's talking about here."

175,"I got ghosted bad when I first started seeing guys. He was the first person I fell for. We spoke for months and clicked really well. The last time I seen him we spent the night together. He opened up about a really sensitive issue from his past. Next morning, we spoke before he left I even walked him to his train. I got home and he had text saying had a great night yada yada, I text him back.

Next day he hadn't replied which I thought was strange. From talking non stop to that, anyway a couple of days past and nothing. I'm thinking he regrets opening up and telling me that bad thing from his past so I text him if that's what's bothering you, don't let it. I'll never mention it again unless you want to talk about it.


Anyway a week has now past and nothing. I get drunk send a cringe message lol. Nothing. I know at this stage its over, never had been ghosted or ghosted anyone before so was a hard blow when it was the first person I had fallen for, coupled with the fact i had previously thought I was only attracted physically to guys and not emotionally so it opened up a whole can of worms and made me realize I was gay.

So I stopped making contact with him, I was cleaning my room and in the drawer where I kept money I noticed it was missing. I had 150 dollars there and only 50 was there. I'm 100% sure 150 was there as I had just put it in there the night before he came. That shit stole from me, lesson is he wasn't the person I thought he was and if someone who you get on good with ghosts you then they're a shitty person so fuck them."

199,"Gyms are different experiences for everyone.  Don't say a gym sucks for you until you know it actually does.  Check them out.

* Don't try to just jump straight into a hardcore routine.  

* Just be active.  Get your body into the habit of moving and being active.  Run, lift, play a sport that's intense.  Beat up your body essentially.  Not to a point of injury, but to a point where you're exhausted after each one.  Once you've developed the habit (takes about a month), then you can start working into routines and programs.

* The 40% rule is real if you've ever heard of it.  Basically, when your mind says you're done, you've gone too far, you can't go anymore, you're really only 40% done.  Your brain wants to quit before you really should, because it's a defense mechanism.  You'll be surprised what your body is capable of, even right now.  Push yourself."

The guy you're with sounds great and it sounds like he will be great with you when you're ready. However you choose to define your virginity is however you choose to--that's your business and your body. It doesn't even need to be something you need to focus on. Rape is not typically viewed to be sex in the sense that consent is not involved, but again--you determine what matters for you.

218,"So I'm going to guess you're asking mostly a rhetorical question, but I'll try to give an answer that is a bit more academic than just 'because ugly guys can't fuck'. I don't strictly believe all of this this is true, for the record, just playing devil's advocate.

In general, hooking up and hyper-sexual activity are the source of a lot of issues with the gay community. The straight community has these too, sure, but the issue has persistently affected the gays. Here are just a few I could come up with.

* You have the rise of STD's; HIV in the past and now with PrEP you're seeing rises in bacterial infections. This is bad from a public health perspective, in many different ways. 
* There are a lot of psychological issues associated with the constant rejection, the obsessiveness over sex and how to feel good in the short term, and the ideals which it seems all gay men are striving to meet. The short term pleasure seeking gets more and more intense. This also manifests in fairly widespread cheating issues. We're always looking for the next best thing. 
* If you don't match the traditional smooth, super-muscular, blonde, etc. phenotype there is a feeling like you'll never be good enough. Just look at all the posts of ""anybody out there who likes XYZ."" There are always people who do like those characteristics, but the fact that people are asking frequently shows a psychological instability that is detrimental to our sense of ego.
* The increase in casual sex seems to also mark a decrease in romantic pursuits. This is one that is shared among all young people trying to date, but grindr is probably the most obvious manifestation here. We aren't ""going on dates"" we're just ""hanging out"" and if we aren't exclusive then I'm probably hooking up with a bunch of other people too, because I can. I can message you at 11:45 and we can screw ten minutes later. There is still romance out there, but it feels like you have to dig through a lot of dumb gunk to get there.
* Sex is addictive. Having such easy access to it is dangerous, and can easily ruin your life if you get too caught up in the spiral.
* Sex and drugs seem to attract each other which is another public health issue.

Again, I don't personally hold all of these beliefs and they are super complex issues anyway so please don't blast my inbox about how I'm a terrible slut-shaming person. I personally don't participate in hook up culture because it doesn't fit my views of the world, but that doesn't mean you can't. I'm sure a lot of people do post about Grindr just because they are struggling with the app and after being discriminated against and told they aren't worth anything look for an outlet to complain. "
