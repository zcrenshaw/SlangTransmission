0,"It's not that I don't want to be associated to gay culture I just quite frankly don't entirely feel like I belong in that community. Don't get me wrong I've tried joining the tribe but I never felt totally accepted. 

I'm not quite fem but I'm not quite masc. I'm not that sexual and even when I am I'm rarely dtf. I'm not a fan of clubbing every weekend, or a fan of club drugs, I just like my weed. Not everything is a political issue for me. I'm not a fan of pride or flags(both national or sexuality flags). Oh and I hate having to defend using condoms every rare instance I have sex. Like guys it's not a challenge jeez. And no I don't care if you're on prep and it's not like we can get pregnant. 


Also the community is so cliquey that it hurts. Every group thinks they're better than the other. Half don't believe bi guys exist. People get offended if you're not interested and start claiming it's about their age, race, type (fem or masc), etc. When in actuality I just don't find you attractive, am here with my friends, or I know I won't go home with you tonight but that's what you're looking for and I'm just trying to not waste your time. 

Oh and if you go to a club that has a drag queen and you have resting bitch face and your arms crossed absent-mindedly they will call you out on it. And there will likely be a best ass competition. 

I could go on and make a list of what bothers me. But that's not the point. The gay community just isn't my tribe, I fit better with the nerds, that's where I feel I belong. 

I can be myself with them. With the gay community I feel like you need to be either a skinny, flirty, white twink, or a 'straight acting' ex jock. And you must want to bang someone at least once a week.

If you like it, great be a part of it. But don't hate on the guys who don't want to be a part of your tribe. If you really wanted all gay guys to be a part of gay culture, well, it's time to be more inclusive. To stop the in fighting in the community. To understand not every gay person is the same. To not be such ... bullies. There I said it. Some of y'all feel like bullies that after they shit on you 'don't get why you don't like us or want to be one of us'.

 I might get flack for this but please remember this is just my experience and that of a few friends. I get not all LGBT people do this, just like not all men harass women. 

Edit: tl;dr: Don't assume everyone has a good experience with gay culture and people are welcome to join diffrent tribes if that's the case. Just find where you feel you belong not where everyone tells you you belong. 

Edit 2: I never thought I'd make this kind of edit but Holy cow thanks for the gold! That's awesome I feel so fancy now 😀 I'm glad so many people could relate to this, but it's also disheartening that this is the case for so many, the community should be a place of acceptance and encouragement and not what it is right now. But thank you again, seriously, it made my week! "

10,"My experience with people who do not want to be associated with gay culture, are more masculine gays who do not like stereotypes of the traditional gay man, you know the snapping rolling the neck gay man who wears makeup and is obsessed with Cher. They are allowed to feel that way,because there is no one way to be gay. I just do not like when some of these people like to clown and shame feminine gay men,cause at the end of the day they are being themselves just like you are being yourself. "

12,"I mean, if you want to take the high road (be honest, find out if he's a better person, maybe give him a chance), you might teach him a thing about what it means to be a forgiving person.  But you also don't want to teach him to take you for granted or help get a job for a homophobe who's going to embarrass you and reflect poorly on you professionally.

Tell him you'd like to meet up and talk with him about it.  Tell him you want to help, but you also can't recommend someone for a job who's going to reflect poorly on you.  Tell him that the person he was the last time you interacted with him and his family isn't the kind of person you can recommend for a job.  Meet up for coffee or something, talk about your concerns, talk about what's going on in his life, ask him if he still has a problem with gay people (cause he'd be working with at least one), and ask him what he'd do if one of *his* kids comes out to him 15 years from now.  Basically, give him a life interview before you get him a job interview.

Don't like what you hear?  Don't recommend him for the job."

16,"Honestly, I would stop talking to them. They think your relationship is inherently not equal to theirs, that your love isn't as valuable and ""moral"" as their love. That's something I wouldn't tolerate in an acquaintance, much less someone who used to be close to me. They basically think you're not an equal person to them.

Not attending your marriage is also a huge insult, possibly even worse than his ""personal beliefs"". He cant evem set aside the beliefs he picked up from this Christian girl for his brother? He was willing to convert to her anti gay belief system despite the fact his own brother is gay?

I dont think he values your relationship together very much, so why should you value it?"
17,"Hoo boy lemme tell ya. 

Straight guys will never understand how AWARE of our own bodies gay guys are.  We spent a good portion of time in the closet carefully choosing our mannerisms and keeping certain things in check.  

If we're in public we constantly scan the environment to make sure that it might be okay to kiss our SO.  Even if we are ""okay"" with it, then we're still just shy of being Carelessly in love.  

Gay guys can float somewhere in between Boy world and Girl world and never quite *fully* belong in either.  

Straight guys don't realize that they have the luxury of being *in touch with their emotions*, but for gay guys we're being *stereotypical*.  

In general, I think straight guys and gay guys are waaaayyy different.  I love being gay but damn it's like playing life on Hard difficulty sometimes.  I like a challenge, though. So it.works out"

11. Realizing you can't visit some countries because they will push you off the roof.

Porn past haunt you at work or school....gaybro.....done it. 

Straight guys just try not to feel their feelings. So they get really pissed when they get hurt, and they don't have a mechanism for de-escalation or for mature evaluation and compromise. It really is SEE JANE RUN from an emotional perspective compared to a gaybro who has been obsessing over his own emotions around orientation since he was six. 

So...I think all gaybros should have a rainbow cape, because we are like superheros. We navigate so many complex difficult situations and often with NO MENTORS or SUPPORTERS.

52,"I simply don't like gay guys all that much, that's essentially why.

TL;DR:  I did a friend purge and only had mostly straight friends left, after realizing I was done with cunty people.

I am not hyper masculine as a previous commenter tried to slant the discussion.  I'm not hyper feminine.  I'm just a regular gay guy.  People usually figure out I am gay.  I am not into the bitchy, mean-girl culture that almost all gay guys are into.   I'm over the shock humour that gay guys love to pull in a group of people, like one acquaintance who feels he has to talk about putting a dildo in his ass at the dinner table with a mixed group of people.  I do watch Ru Paul's Drag race, but that keeps mean spirited people at arms length, and it's funny to watch, but not fun to live.   

I used to have many gay friends and acquaintances.  My best friend and roommate was a drag queen.   He was a mean ol' cunt though.  

I moved into my own place by the time the following story happened:  One day he made one of his mean comments in front of a group of people I didn't know - his new drag family.  He used embarrassing info about a guy I brought home one night.   He did this solely so he could get a laugh from a group, at my expense - something he had taken up doing a lot since becoming a DQ.   I did the right thing and pulled him aside and explained how that shit wasn't cool with me anymore, and that I would never speak to him again if he brought up my personal life again to people as a joke.  My personal life was not to be fodder for his witty little showoff sessions.  10 minutes later he did it again.  I glared at him.  He knew he had done wrong, as his eyes went wide and then he looked away and got quiet.  I said nothing.  I just picked up my coat and walked away.  I have not spoken to him to this day, and I ignore him when I see him on the street.

When I got rid of him as a best ""friend"", I realized how nice it was not having a total cunt around me, narrating my life.  I realized he had been putting me down for years, and I was taking that shit just to fit in to a group I no longer wanted to fit into.  There might have been sexual tension.  I don't know, as I was never attracted to him in the least.  

After that, I made a pact with myself to purge all the poisonous people from my life, and realized after a couple years, that all I had left were my straight friends.  I still have a few gay friends, but I don't hang out with them much anymore.  They are more facebook friends than anything else at this point.  And now, I am just happier.  I don't go to gay bars, as I have, my hubby.  I go to Pride because my straight friends want to go.  Other than that there isn't any gay culture to me.... it's just ""culture"" and I couldn't care less if gay guys are there or not.  The clubs I go to are more like pop up events, or clubs where DJ friends are playing.  The house scene is mixed, nice, and accepting.

My straight buddies never act like mean-girls, they are so much nicer and chill to gay guys than gay guys are to other gay guys.  They crack the odd joke, and have fun with it, but I know it comes from a totally different place than the mean spirited jabs.

So that's why I checked out.

Edit:  typos."
53,"I'm with you on that one BUT, I would confront him about it instead.

I have friends who refuse to believe a guy can be straight if he enjoys pegging, or any anal play for that matter. Apparently wanting stimulate your prostate and have a better orgasm makes you queer, even if you were to do it yourself with a toy.

67,"He sounds like one of the Christians who focuses on the wrong part of the message. Too many Evangelicals focus too much on the ""sins"" other people commit and ignore the message of love and empathy for our fellow people that Jesus taught.  

Most anthropological views agree that homosexuality was called out as a violation of law in the Old Testament because the Jews at the time were a small semi-nomadic population, and anything that took away from reproduction was wrong. It has nothing to do with STDs. The only mentions of homosexuality in the New Testament are from Paul, who met Jesus one time, and viewed most things pleasurable as sinful. Most scholars of the Greek language (which is the language Paul and most other New Testament writers used) also agree that Paul was mistranslated in his writings against homosexuality and that he was actually prohibiting exploitative relations between men and younger boys, not consensual relationships between adult men.

70,"Okay well perhaps I misspoke and used some poor examples. 

I'll start by saying I never felt 'cool' for not fitting in. I craved to be accepted somewhere I felt at home. The gay community/culture did not help fill that void of not belonging, so I sought a diffrent tribe to feel at home with. I found that eventually and now feel a lot 'cooler' then I did before. 

 Again I don't hate the community and I'm very passionate about lgbtq+ rights, I just didn't feel like I fit. I'm really really happy that it does fit people, cause everyone should feel like they belong somewhere. 

I'd say that the lgbtq+ movement is accepting and a huge advocate for safe sex, but I found the opposite to be true with my local community of Toronto and the GTA. Not to mention according to the cdc condom use in gay youth is actually down and syphilis is up by 60% I would source this but I'm on mobile and I'm more than sure y'all have access to google.

I've found in my personal sex life that condoms are now up to debate. Many guys say they're on prep, they're clean, condoms just don't feel good, they can't keep it up with a condom, hell one guy even tried to convince me to have shower sex and that you can't use a condom in the shower after I refused to go bare. I find telling a lot of guys take the condom thing as a challenge. 

 My trans and bi friends too find a lot of opposition in the community. From getting hate on dating apps for being trans to being told to just pick a side being bi. A lot of people feel the gay community is just that, a gay community. 

But it goes beyond hooking up, drugs, and condoms. It's the in fighting, the drama (like a lot of people mentioned), the lack of boundaries, hyper sexualization, to even the little things like drag, queer shows and lady Gaga. These are things I don't associate with, they're not my jam, but if their yours that's awesome. I don't hate these things they're just not for me. 

The way I look at it is the lgbtq+ movement and the community is a lot like canada and Alberta.  Canada promotes diversity and acceptance to all. But there are a lot of local communities in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada that are racist, Islamophobic, and homophobic. There's a dissonance between the values of the whole of Canada and the localized communities within it. Which I believe to be the case for the lgbtq+ movement and community. "

Normally this is an issue a tissue could solve but his parents had wall paper in their bedroom and my apparently caustic semen started to make the colors run. The by the time we cleaned it up there was a foot long streak of messed up colors that was very, very noticeable. I quickly put my clothes on left. When his parent came home they though there was a leaky pipe that caused the damage so they had part of the wall torn open looking for a leaky pipe which in reality was just my dick. "

The way your friends talk about him only adds to the issues he already has and the pain he already feels.

I'd ask my friends to stop talking about him that way (well at least not in his presence), maybe incorporate him more in you all's gatherings. 

I'd also talk to him about his feelings and how he perceives himselfs as a man. Remind him he IS a man, as much as you. He doesn't necessarily want to fall into a ""heteronormative"" (hate that word lmao) type of relationship where you're the man and he's the woman. He wants to be your equal and people don't necessarily perceive him that way.

Make him your equal in front of other people too. "

Yes. 

This always makes me feel a little bad, but...Well shit...here goes. 

We started dating when I was 32, He was 24. I was his first serious relationship, he was my 3rd. He worked at night, I worked during the day, He was fem, I was masc, He was only bottom, I was verse/top, he did drag, I took pictures and fetched drinks. We had a decent life, but he did things I didn't like. He never worked full time, I made a lot more money than he did, and constantly had to work at keeping things paid. He would squander his paycheck, I had to budget hard to keep us fed, gasoline, rent et cet. He also would wait till I fell asleep and then would leave and go party. I hated that, I had limited time for bar and party, I had an early morning job and had to be on time. I got really pissed because he bought a bed and moved into another bedroom, I didn't want or need a room mate, if we weren't sleeping together I felt he didn't love me. Push came to shove and I ended it. He was devastated. He went to counseling, stalked me a little bit, came back around and slept with me several times, tried to fire it back up, but you know the issues were always there. For a long time we seemed to be always dating someone when the other was single. He would come around, I would be dating someone. I would go to a show, he had a boyfriend. I finally met someone and got married. He was so pissed/hurt he couldn't make himself attend the wedding. We eventually talked it all out over time and identified the things we each did wrong and apologized. (Not incl for time and space here, but it was a lot) We got to a really good place. We talked on the phone and he discussed a visit out to see me and my husband. It never happened. He died of a massive heart attack the year he turned 40. He was happily moving into a new place with his boyfriend, put together some furniture and died. It always feels weird to talk about it, but my husband knew him, and is always supportive. when I read he had passed on Facebook I called information and got his mother's number and called. She really appreciated it, and I was glad to have spent time with him. She told me, ""I know you were married to another guy, but he always burned a candle for you, you know that? He thought you were his love."" 

I cried a bit...but I am at a really good place with it these days. "

114,"I really wish gay people(particularly ones who've just come out) wouldn't feel such a strong need to conform with whatever ""being gay"" is to them. It's not that we are the same, but that so many of us try to be. I bet it's a big reason reason for gay people's lingering high mental illness rate.

120,"Why? Because ""gay culture"" makes your sexuality the focal point of your entire personality. That's fucking stupid. My entire life does not revolve around the fact that I like dicks. I don't need to go and scream it in a parade or mention it to every single person I come across. I'm a complex person, I like a lot of different things, and I don't want to be pigeonholed. "
121,"Being raised in an Asian household, you taught to always remove shoes when entering a house. Your own house or your friends/relatives. 

I completely don't understand why many Americans don't?? Why would you want to track all the dirt and germs from outside into your house and carpet, where you often sit and lay on the floor etc? Also being in shoes all day is hot/constricting/uncomfortable so why do you want that while you're in the house?"
122,The Chechnya one has a lot of hot guys...makes me think a lot of them are fake profiles that people with bad intentions make in order to lure gay men.

124,"&gt; he's just incredibly selfless and willing to go through with it

No, by providing him with unfettering access to your cock you are giving him precisely what he needs. It's called compatibility.

As an aside, if he is directing the action here, giving you a blow job can mean he is more dominant than you. He is using your cock for his pleasure. If he is submissive he wants you to use his mouth for your pleasure. It is not the role of a submissive to decide how to please you."
125,"I was very suicidal as a 20 something. I had no one to confide my feelings in. I make it a point now to help people, especially young gay people to overcome their depression and see that they have value and purpose, because they do!!!

131,"Read this article: http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/

Later on you might change your mind and want to see him and that will be ok. Don't allow him or his gf to put you on the spot as if it's somehow you who has to make some big decision about the future of your relationship with him. He's the one who's fucked up here- he's in the difficult position, not you. Just keep paying attention to how you feel at the time and base your reaction on that. He'll regret this- have no doubt about that. And he'll find his way to regret it all on his own- you don't need to help him there. "
136,"He 100% knows he has performance issues (premature ejaculation). He's seen porn. That's likely why he wanted to avoid dealing with you afterwards.

Your experience is kind of what it was like with the first guy I had sex with, only in my case, we were at my place, so he very quickly got dressed and left. Somehow, I ended up talking to a woman who'd had sex with him (he was bi-curious), and she said the same thing happened with her. My sense is that guys with this problem have some pretty serious self-esteem issues connected to it.   "
137,"I have some straight male friends who genuinely don't give a fuck if people think they're gay and do not allow their behavior to be policed through accusations of homosexuality. They introduced me to getting pedicures. 

All of which is to say that it's getting better. "
138,"&gt; and I couldn't just turn them away, especially when they sometimes had to drive for 30 minutes to get to my place.

Oh lord, no! You can ALWAYS turn someone away. For ANY reason - especially a legit one as you describe. "

140,"I went out with her to have lunch today, and a part of me really wanted to share my life with her. My actual life. While we sat down to eat, I hesitated to say what I wanted to a few times. Then it happened. When I told her, I saw her facial expression. I knew what she was going to say before she even said anything. My family is very religious, (Christian household) and if that doesn't already give it away.. I had the usual lecture about how being gay is ""wrong"" or ""a sin"", but it didn't really make me feel anything. I guess because I prepared myself for it beforehand. She says that she'll keep it a secret from my dad and other siblings, which I was happily pleased to hear. I just wished she was more supportive, happy, or both for me. It's alright though! :) and sorry if this seems a bit too vague. "

Being out in the workplace can be a big deal for people - every co-worker I've had has assumed that I'm straight, and it's annoying having to come out to people at work over and over. Plus, dealing with homophobic coworkers is a real and serious issue."

164,"Lol I don't even know what people mean anymore by ""the community"". Like, overwhelmingly ""the community"" is a huge advocate for safe sex. And it's completely accepting of people that don't hook up or do drugs. Whenever people talk about ""the community"", it's full of whatever they want it to be. I feel likes it's just a stand-in so gay guys can feel like they're so cool when they're ""not accepted"" by it.

165,"This isnt very out there, but looking back gives me a laugh.

The day I came out to my parents the shit really hit the fan. Later that night I talked/argued it out with my dad, but he believed at 16 I was just too young to make such a definitive statement. After some silence, he looked up at me with tears in his eyes and said 

_""Is this why you like Modern Family so much?""_


I was struck by how utterly stupid, innocent and naive that question was, all I could do was give an incredulous ""Noooo!""."
166,"&gt; There is a lot of explicit content on this sub, would you be comfortable with children being exposed to that?

Welcome to the internet...? There's explicit content everywhere. If its not this sub its going to be another sub. This sub they can at least ask questions pertaining to relationships and sex that their sex ed likely doesn't cover. 

The posters will either be honest and post their age, which lets someone ignore them thread, or they will just not mention their age and you'll be answering their questions anyway. "
167,I'd get to know him in person first for a while until you feel comfortable that he won't steal your stuff.
168,"Yes! And they say that any gay guy who doesn't enjoy cross dressing or singing Cher and ABBA is experiencing internalized homophobia. Just because you're gay, it doesn't mean you have to conform to every gay stereotype. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with liking those things, but gay guys shouldn't villainize other gay guys who don't like those same things. Just be yourself!"

184,"Someone once told me there was no such things as good kissers, just compatible kissers; those that both like the same style of kissing.

That said, I still think my way's best: just part your lips slightly and imagine you're trying to get them round one of their lips (the bottom one's usually easiest to go for). When you've got their lip in between yours then just a bit of suction and back off, then go back and repeat or go for the other lip. It's pretty simple and quite an intimate way of kissing. Try lingering on one of the passes and that ups the intimacy.

Also, as another has said, get your hands or arms round them. Don't think too hard about this though on your first few kisses cos you'll be focusing too hard on the kissing anyway. Just put them on their hips or round their waist. Back of the neck is a favourite of mine and a lot of people are sensitive there - I've gently rubbed some guys' earlobes before to decent effect as well.

Things that you can do wrong: make the whole thing really sloppy and wet, my current guy does that and you come away wanting to wipe your lips - not attractive - having your lips a normal amount of dry is fine. Also, don't go too wide on parting your lips when you're going in, I've had guys like open their entire mouth as if they're gonna eat me, that's nasty. Finally, do not go for tongue on the first few passes, go for it after that and do so just a bit to test the waters, some people don't like it.

But like I said, compatible kissers, not good kissers.

Edit - oh and yeh it's the same as kissing a girl, just to answer the question.

Edit 2 - oh and you'll basically work all this out by yourself. It mostly just goes on instinct."

189,"It's interesting that you see the pre-anal that you did for ages as foreplay, something that didn't count.

From his perspective it could well be the case that he feels you had sex in different ways for ages, and then finished up a long session with a bit of anal, by which point he was so worked up that didn't last very long.

As everyone says, communication. Keep judgement out of your voice. Just be clear that you feel sex is finished when you both finish, and that's what you want to work towards from now on, whatever way it takes for you to get there. That that's more important than running the gauntlet of having sex every which way like a marathon."
