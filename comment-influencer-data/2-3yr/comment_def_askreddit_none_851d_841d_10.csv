"I used to have a manager like this... it was amazing! Got all my work done and the work/life balance was good.... we all worked hard through tough projects and had time to relax when the timing was okay.... aaaaand then I got switched to another group. 

Now I'm getting babysat, handheld, and micromanaged so hard I'm about to rage quit from a company I've been with for almost six years. 

It's true what they say... that people will stay for good managers and leave with shitty ones. I wanted to life with this company, but def not with this management team..."
"I'm still in hs and undecided as to what course I want, but will def go to college.

Well, mom doesn't think I fit into college, says I should just stay at home and take care of my parents, for several reasons:

1. I'm the youngest and a girl. Somehow that automatically makes me their maid.
2. My brothers are extremely smart. No one thinks I'm smart.
3. Just because I haven't decided on a course yet, they think I'm dumb
4. Since my brothers are succesful, someone among us should stay with and take care of the parents because if everyone ia succesful, no one is left with them.

What's worse is that she tells them to the rest of my family. My grandparents, coworkers and my aunt and cousins. They all agree with her. 

Edit: I just want to say, thank you sooooo much everyone for all your comments. You guys make me feel a lot better and I'm starting to have a lot more hope that everything will be okay.

I will go to college, no matter what, because that's what I really want to do. In the meantime, I think I'm going to focus on finding something I'm passionate about.

I'm glad I got this off my chest, and I'm glad for this thread. This issue has been bugging me for a long while now but I never realized how much it really affected me until I put it into words. 

Thank you for the kind words. You don't know how much it means to have more support from strangers than people you actually know.

To people who are facing the same dilemma, you're not alone. We can do this together! And thank you again!"
