Why on earth would that be a red flag?
"This is going to be very long, but it's the most important thing to have ever happened to me.


Before my current SO and I got together, we were best friends. She was my rock, and my everything through a very rough time in my life following a very abusive relationship, which led to me developing a drug abuse problem, depression, and nearly dropping out of school, twice. I loved her and I still loved her, but at that point in my life, I didn't want to make her any more involved in my problems. She was there for me, and I went to her for support but I didn't want to make these her problems.

My entire life was shit at this time. My schedule, my sleep, my health, my weight, my budget, my education. Every aspect was deteriorating. I was spending 12 hours a day in bed, watching nothing but shitty tv and eating crap food. There were days I didn't leave my house, one time almost a week.

I really just fell so hard in love, and I knew she would never want me the way I was. I decided that my first step was to start going to therapy, to talk to a professional and figure out where to start. I didn't want to google or reddit or any of that shit. I started seeing my therapist initially for school concerns. I didn't know what direction to go in, nor where to start. I wasn't motivated, I didn't have any goals. He helped me figure out what it is I wanted to do, and to start creating smaller goals that will get me closer and closer to doing what I wanted to do. I began organizing my life into a journal, breaking down my days, weeks, and months into the tasks that I needed to get done so that I can be a better me. This then led into me creating a sleep schedule along with a proper diet. In creating a sleep schedule and diet, I was effectively cutting out time that I was wasting rather than sleeping, and saving money on not spending or buying delivery food. These both helped my sleep and overall wellness, and I began to feel more alert, and less sluggish. I gave up smoking weed for a while too. I still smoke quite often now as pain relief from multiple sports injuries, but it do it after work, or as a reward from a long day; always when I don't have an obligation. I previously was waking up, getting high, and getting nothing done.

I picked up a job, nothing big, but something to help me pay rent because I no longer had any scholarship money saved up, and my parents can't afford to support me financially. Getting a job gave me money, and gave me a concrete block in my schedule. I now had an obligation that required me to be at my best to perform. No more sleeping in, no more getting high. I now had expectations that had to be met. In doing so, I was able to save up enough money to move out of the drug-enabling co-op I was in, into my own place in a house with some good people. 

I also got my emotions in check, which I believe is the more integral part of all of this. I took grasp of all external factors in my life: my education, my income, my housing, and my health, but I had to work on what was going in *inside* me. I learned to let go. I began practicing meditation and mindfulness. This brought so much clarity into my life. With all the negative bullshit that was going on in my life, I was able to no longer repress it. I could peacefully look at what was going on, and just let go. I stopped hating my abusive ex. I stopped hating myself for what I had become. I stopped feeling depressed, feeling paranoid of being hated by my parents for where I was with my life, I stopped worrying. I began living in the now, in the present moment. Every day was a new day, and I started seeing it like that. I took every challenge, every obstacle from this point on one step at a time, and I've never felt so relieved. It was as if the weight of the world was lifted from my shoulders. I could breathe. I could think. And although it wasn't an overnight change, it was gradual, and I kept getting better and better. I'm still currently working on becoming even better, but I've made so much more progress than I ever have in my entire life. 

I did this over the course of a year, and she was there for me. I honestly did what I could to keep these problems from falling onto her, but we grew closer and closer as I got through this. I eventually let her know that I was doing therapy, I opened up about what was going on in my head, and the worries that I had, and the things that I felt. I told her about my accomplishments in my life, and she praised and supported me. I was doing this for both her and I. She saw growth in me. I became strong, and I got my shit together. I was out of my crap environment that I was previously in. I was making money. I was doing better in school. I grabbed my life by the fucking horns and took control, and it's been that way ever since. I found what it was I wanted to do with my life, I've been making progress in my field, and today actually, I just got accepted into my first internship. I'm excelling as a person, I feel more alert and more aware, and much much more healthy. I've been doing yoga, I've been eating primarily vegan, and I've lost a ton of body fat. I'm no longer overweight, and I now have an attractive athletic physique. I'm proud to say that I got my shit together. My life, since I decided to make this change, has felt like I'm driving down a road, and catching green lights all the way down. And I'm going to make sure it never stops.

One day, towards the end of that summer, we went on a walk as friends, and came back as a couple. She's been my world ever since. I hope that one day I'm lucky enough to call her my wife. She is my absolute everything, and I don't know what I would do without her love and support. I'm very thankful to share my life with her. She's amazing, and I still get butterflies every time I see her. 

I continue to do the same thing that I did when I started: every night before bed, I write out the next day in my little black notebook, broken down by the hour and then tasks, and I stick to it. It's what keeps me together. I feel a sense of gratification every time I cross off something from the list. It means I'm staying on track and getting my things done, one by one. Each small goal builds up to the next bigger goal. That's how I see life. I break down the big, final goal, into smaller, more obtainable ones, and take everything one step at a time.

EDIT: WOW, I didn't think I was going to get this sort of response! Thank you so much to the kind stranger who gave me my first gilding, and to all the kind responses! I'm going to do my best to respond too all the questions here as soon as I can. Thanks for all the love and support &lt;3 I'm always open for advice and support, and will gladly do what I can to help others who are also going through a rough time as well."
"I'm not sure about the dead thing, I feel like that would *kill* the mood.

The deaf thing, however, I don't think anyone would mind really. I can't think of a reason why. It's not interfering with anything.
I do feel like it would come up in conversation though, before you get to the hooking up part.
Unless it's a fast hookup in which case he definitely doesn't give a fuck. 
Actually he will give one, but not about the deafness."
"If she can't raise the dead then she can't raise my dick, simple."
"A woman in a picture is *only* a picture.  She's got nothing else; she doesn't move, she doesn't smell nice, she doesn't have a nice voice (or any voice), and she's not even 3-D: she's just a flat picture.  So she had better look really, really good, because that's all she has.

A woman in the same room as you has a whole bunch of assets that a woman in a picture doesn't have, and they can make her attractive in ways that wouldn't work if she was just a picture.

When you ask online about some feature, people call up a picture in their heads, and then judge the picture.  That's probably the source of the discrepancy you're seeing.

Few women get work as underwear models.  But most women find men who want to get horizontal.
"
"Just don't get caught looking, you're going to be looking anyways."
"""I want a guy who acts like you and treats me like you, but is better looking than you."""
"Eh, I've seen zombie porn, it wouldn't freak me out too bad  
  
Edit: Oh, yeah that makes more sense. Honestly I don't think I would mind if I somehow didn't know before hand. Every deaf person I've met (four, maybe five total) had a very particular way of speaking though, very distinct."
"I would just like to point out that if muscles truly worked like that, well your anus would be kind-of a limited-use deal. Can't say I know of anyone who ever took a few large dumps and got permanent Olestra-butt from it."
"My friend was extremely overweight and had kind of a muppet-sounding voice. He'd always go after very pretty girls that were really nice and friendly towards him, then complain when they wouldn't give him a chance romantically - he'd even get kind of nasty towards them.

Me and a mutual friend sat him down and explained that this was becoming something of a pattern that he goes for these really cute girls who obviously put a lot of work into their appearance, and he doesn't really do the same. We tried to gently nudge him towards girls that were more in his lane, and he kept insisting that he can't help if he doesn't find them attractive. He never recognized the hypocrisy. "
"She's driving home now, we're gonna have some frozen ravioli and garlic toast for dinner because we cheap af"
"Another woman checking in, we look at leggings. When another woman has a really low cut blouse. We look. The thing is, you don't stare. If you are having a one on one conversation, you don't look. But if you are out, just people watch, and take a peek. But don't stare. "
"Fair warning, I've had a lot more experience dating/hooking up with guys than girls, so my experiences will most likely be skewed.

**Girlfriend:**  
* Hold hands/show affection in public without feeling awkward  
* Openly talk about to coworkers/casual acquaintances without them acting awkward  
* Pick them up, carry them around, impress them with your manliness
* Get back scritches with those heavenly long fingernails

**Boyfriend:**  
* Enjoy long periods of silence, especially when eating  
* Share clothes  
* Get rid of gender roles and do what you feel like doing on dates  
* Do manly projects together, like move furniture, do home repairs, etc....  
* Laugh at every fart, even if it happens in the middle of sex (especially if it happens in the middle of sex)"
My vote is you're surrounded by idiots
She sounds like she has her shit together in my mind.   Fuck social media.
It ties back into the stigma against gay men. People are much less comfortable with sexuality between two men than between two women.
Your attitude towards social media would have a lot more weight if you weren't posting it on social media.
what the fuck
"She likes your qualities, but isn't attracted to you."
"He went to get ~~cigarettes~~ roasted chicken and never came back. 

Now I'm hungry and lonely. Mostly hungry, it's been half an hour."
Start wearing leggings yourself. You will feel too self-conscious to look at other people. 
"I have a friend who is not particularly unattractive..for a 54 year old. Compared to others his age he is handsome. Not fat, works out, most of his hair. But he is unrealistic as fuck..women 40 and up always hit on him..but he is convinced he can get the hot 20 year old and always comes off as creepy instead and always strikes out. He refuses to change."
"As a man that has no social media online presence (that could identify as me), I fear that this is a red flag for women who meet me. 

""What? He doesn't have Facebook or an Instagram? He probably has no friends or has something to hide from society, or isn't very interesting"""
"&gt; **Boyfriend:**  
&gt; * Enjoy long periods of silence, especially when eating

This is especially hilarious given this comment from the askwomen thread:

&gt;Bisexual girl here who recently ended a 2 and a half year relationship with another girl...

&gt; I've noticed this great aspect of our relatonship: me and my ex girlfriend could chat for hours about our stuff that none of the guys I've been with would find interesting. Stuff like problems with friends in high school, make-up, losing weight, fashion, annoying people etc."
"It's a lot like ass pennies....

You've probably cleaned my piss...  Piss cleaner...  

The day I stopped cleaning piss was the day I unleashed the inner me, the successful me...

Just kidding.

Once when I was a younger man I managed a photo lab. We had a seat pisser. I was determined to figure out who it was.  It was the Asian girl. "
"People told me to lower my standards, but I just improved myself instead. 10/10, do recommend"
"It turned into a big mess. Kicked her out of my house that same hour I got the results. She didn't fight it at the time but she ended up taking me to court for child support since at that point, I was the one supporting her and she wasn't with the guy she was screwing around with. The court ended up ordering another paternity test which also showed I wasn't the father. Luckily, I never signed the birth certificate. Haven't seen her since."
"Whenever in a conversation or meeting, at the end, I fold my arms and say Good, before I leave. Did not notice it until at one meeting, all my developers and designers at the same time folded their arms, said Good and left."
"My two best friends are warehouse workers, while I have a nice salaried career that makes good use of my degree and skills. They seem to be just as happy, if not happier than me. Where I'm too tired to do much in the evenings or working on the weekend. They get to hang out, go to the gym, play rugby drink and smoke weed and enjoy life. Their job doesn't define them, it's a means of paying the blls."
You'll be fine if you make an effort to be. It's easy to be stuck if you don't.
"The more awkward you get about it, the more awkward it is.

If your response to it is: ""Oh my goodness I'm so embarrassed, I hate when this happens, I hope you're not freaked out by this, I knew I should have told you earlier, etc, etc"", then it's going to be awkward.

If your response to it is: ""They help me hear. Don't stop."", it's really, *really* not going to matter.

That's just my opinion, but I'd think most guys would feel similarly."
"""I can't help it if I only like attractive girls!"" 

""Those girls are shallow bitches if they don't like me just because I'm not attractive.""

... *facepalm*"
"Nah we did. Then somehow it became ""but it should only matter what's on the inside."" Total cognitive dissonance. The obvious truth was that he wanted a hot girlfriend but was too lazy to make himself attractive enough for one. "
"Kind of knew it the second he came out. I have really dark, black hair. The baby came out with light, brown hair. That, and the suspicion I had all throughout the pregnancy that she might have cheated.

I pushed for a test a few months after and we found out the kid wasn't mine."
"You don't, they're gods gift. Enjoy it while they are still in fashion.  "
"All my past male lovers have been able to spot me on the bench. never dated a chick that could do that.

"
"It's basically the same rule as looking at the Sun. You can look briefly, just don't stare."
The kind that disappears?
"Write some lyrics, sell them to Drake."
That's the exact opposite of a red flag for me. Few things bother me more than people who dedicate a large percentage of their minute to minute attention to social media. 
"I can't introduce my girlfriend to my friends. After the third time one leaves you for a close friend, you start to develop a complex."
She gets excited when she sees her carrying harness because she knows it means we're going for a walk. 
"I dated a girl who had a bad temper and would lash out. Gorgeous girl with a heart of gold. What I realized is that she was insecure because she had a husky voice and grew up in poverty. Her temper was a defense mechanism that could be triggered to stave off situations where she might be shamed. I've come to realize that people with awkward or angry demeanors are probably carrying around a lot emotional baggage. 

I miss the girl too. "
He's a 54 year old getting 40 year old women hitting on him? Yea I'm not sympathetic for his cause. Only way he'd get a 20 year old girl is if he's a sugar daddy who pays for her stuff. 
"Ha! Growing up, any time a cute sales girl approached me in a store my dad would batman outa there.  He'd reappear 1-2 minutes later like absolutely nothing happened.  No questions, no comments, nothing.  My relationships were my problem and if I was going to succeed, fail or not notice it wasn't going to get influenced by him."
"Love it.  Once you abandon the idea of ""success"" as essentially a marketing gimmick to make you work harder than you want to in order to earn more money than you really need, life becomes a lot brighter.  Particularly insidious is the idea that you should measure your success relative to others.  The idea of a ""career"" is also a sham.  Just do whatever you need to do to pay the bills.  Time is always going to be more valuable than money.  If someone asks you ""what do you do?"" don't take them to be referring to your job.  Tell them what you like to do in your free time.  Nothing to be embarrassed about.  Life isn't a competition.  "
"""You and I will never have a romantic relationship."""
"~~She's not dead, she's just British!~~

I'll be honest. If I knocked one out, I'd probably spend the next 5 minutes geeking out over how cool they are. I mean, you're an actual cyborg. Bits of you were not good enough, so you straight up replaced them with creations of metal, plastic and human ingenuity. And then they are held on by implanted magnets. I want implanted magnets.

Now I'm trying to work out how to how to hang earrings off the magnets so that they hang down behind your ears with no visible means of support and you're probably getting creeped out. But anyway, why would you not brag about being a cyborg?"
"This happened to my step-dad. 

He was married before my mom for a couple of years and had a daughter. They split up not long after she was born, like less than a year. He met my mom a year or two later. My stepsister and I were less than a year apart in age so it worked out really great. We ended up becoming really close. 

Well around the time my stepsister turned 18 her mom decided to sue my step-dad for money towards her college education, despite the fact that he had always provided for her without complaints. Around that time my grandmother (my step-dads mother) mentioned how there were some rumors that she overheard at the baby shower 18 years earlier about him not being the father. She didn't take it seriously but thought it was a good idea to bring up now. 

He did the saliva/swab technique (sent it away and got the results back) and found out she wasn't his. Obviously after that the court case settled. 

The twist? Turns out the guy who was the father was the man the mom ended up marrying after divorcing my stepdad, and she had two kids with him. So the whole time my stepsister had been living with her mom, dad and two full sisters, not her mom, step-dad and two half sisters like she thought.

Pretty messed up situation. It's been 9 years and the whole situation has left some pretty big scars on our family. "
Shades.
"So I'm in a relationship and suddenly my dick only gets turned on by one girl? Fuck that. I'm not going to outwardly stare or make fucked up comments to my girl, but if I said that I wouldn't find other women physically attractive when I'm in a relationship I'd be lying. The point is though, it's just a physical reaction and nothing more. A solid relationship is more than just physical attraction and that's the only reason I'll be with a girl. That's something I'm not going to find with every other girl I see out and about so it's just a quick passing thought but nothing more."
"We don't like being called ""normal."" We prefer hearing-abled. "
"Blinded by the tights! Cut loose the caboose, another round one in the night!

*Thanks for the gold, friend!*"
"Hygiene.  

Yes, your undead army is impressive, but if I can smell them a mile away, I don't want anything to do with you."
"She's not attracted to you.

Nice of her to tell you this upfront frankly.  If you were trying to be friendly with her to go out with her, then pretty much stop and move on with your life.  If you're just friends with her, be friends.  

But don't be an idiot and maintain a, ""If I work hard enough, I will win her over,"" mantra."
I'm getting married with her today! Currently she sleeping and I'm browsing Reddit to calm my nerves. 
"Meet in a public place.  Drive separately.  Don't drink too much.  Let a friend know where you're going, and who you're with.

Most people are just normal people looking for a date."
"I was thinking panda since pandas don't get any action, but then that one whale that sings in a different pitch so it can't find any friends or mates so it's really lonely. Then I realized that would mean my dick is looking for other dicks. 

I'm sticking with the panda."
Knock on doors on a Saturday night and see if a dog barks and a woman answers 
"Physically? We've been broken up for years now and don't speak.

Last I heard, she was on some international community service thing and got kicked out of the country for some shit (my guess is drug related).

She was crazy. But lord knows I am attracted to crazy."
"It would be a bonus for me, I don't have any of those things either."
"Well, he went to LSU. And now plays for the Giants. He doesn't know I exist. 





Yet. "
You are grossly overestimating the skills required to work in a grocery store.  
Go out and meet the next most incredible girl. Make sure to ask for her number this time. 
"Not sure how ""normal"" it is, but I'm the exact same way. My parents will ask me how I feel when X is happening, or if I'm excited for X in the near future. I always tell them that I don't experience excitement the same way they do.

Aunt dies, sister goes to a new country, meet my half-sister for the first time in my life. All are important events, and I recognize them as such, but they just don't register much of an emotional response from me."
"Honestly, no different than the average person, *literally*. 

   Why? Because a good number of people dated in highschool and college and became comfortable in intimate exchanges, learned what they found attractive, and developed some ""game"". An equal number dated in highschool and college, had awful relationships, acquired a load of bad habits and misperceptions, and probably fucked themselves up.
  Way too much credence is given to the idea that ""dating"" is some kind of skill only picked up in a limited window, preferably early (like a language), and can be ""missed"". Sure, the longer you wait to begin, the less time you have, by definition; but, its still always based on your underlying personality and the kind of person you are when alone.

  I've known people who were early starters, in highschool, and moved along at once ever since...and have had consistently bad experiences because they were too oblivious/dumb to learn the lessons constantly being thrown in their faces. Conversely, I've known people who didn't start til well into adulthood, but had the underlying skills and comfort way before that.

   ""Dating"" is mainly about honesty: First with yourself - about your true desires, your actual abilities, and your realistic value to others. Second with the object(s) of your affection - about your boundaries, your goals, and your screw ups. Obviously it's a lot more nuanced and fun than that, but this is just the basic idea.
  So, unless in addition to not dating in highschool/college, you stopped developing as a human being, and as long as your willing to accept the uncomfortable but real truths about romantic relationships, and eager to not let your delicious be dictated by embarrassment or fear, you're not too far behind. And probably ahead of others."
I don't thankfully because my parents sent me to speech therapy for years to make sure I could speak like any normal hearing person. 
Nah bro you're here! Just show her your reddit account! 
"Keys, wallet, phone"
"She was a wonderfully kind and caring woman. She embodied the word devotion and inspired my reciprocation. She was interested in my interests even if she didn't understand why I liked them. She was beautiful. She was the only SO I've had thus far that I picked right. Which is to say she was the only girlfriend who treated me well, wasn't physically abusive, and didn't cheat on me. She put up with me happily

&gt;why could no one else understand 

We were very different in demeanor, we were from very different backgrounds, we were of very different levels of education and intelligence (and desire for either), we had very different hopes and plans about our futures. She was also painfully shy and insecure and came off as aloof or rude as a result. She had some well known mental health issues. We argued a lot. 

My family and my closest friend understood because they had the chance to know her closely. And they cared about me enough to see how much I loved her and how clearly she loved me. They were all sad when we broke up 

Everyone else either didn't get what I saw in her, or didn't get what she saw in me. 

I'll die loving her."
"Ask several men on an internet forum, they'll give good advice"
Social interactions with strangers.
It's probably because men's dicks get smaller the more partners they've had and they assume vaginas work the opposite way.
I don't think of Reddit as social media since so many people can comment anonymously and most don't directly tie profiles here to real names and outward offline identities.
"Not me, but one of my best friends.

He already had a child with this girl, they'd been together 2 years. He thought it was his, because the first one was. He bought and remodeled a new house so they could have more space for the baby. He spends shit tons of money on baby clothes, the works. She goes into labor and takes too long, then has complications. Has to have a C-Section. I'm there with him, waiting outside. I hear a baby crying, then him losing his fucking mind. Crashes, shits going down in the delivery room. The baby is mixed (they are both white). Me and security end up dragging him out of the building, he takes off down the street. I lose him, so I go back to get my phone to call him. As I get there, he is shoving his way back in there for another round. The only reason he didn't get arrested was because the cops felt bad for him, cause that's a shitty way to find out your fiancé was cheating on you."

"I'm currently in a polyamorous relationship with both a guy and girl and some of the things that I can do with each respectively that I can't do with the other include.
I can wrestle with my bf and get a little more physical with him without worrying about seriously injuring him, I can be more of a slob around him and talk smack a little more freely. We both get stoked on sports and can bro out with one another. There is a masculine exchange between us and we can have rougher sex with one another than with our gf. With her I can be a little less guarded emotionally and can show a more sensitive side which is always well received, I can show off a more nurturing and caring side of myself and can show sides of myour personality that many get to see. I can gossip more freely and be ""one of the girls"". We tend to vibe on an emotional level better than with our bf. Our sex tends to be more geared towards me dominating her and she being very submissive. We have threesomes often and it's always a perfect combination of masculine and feminine energy."
"I'm a veterinarian who specializes in cat euthanasia. So, in other words, I'm a pussy slayer."
"Here's one that I love.

You make claims about each other. Like, ""You're a a vegetarian,"" or ""you prefer Franzen to Delillo,"" or whatever. Then they respond to tell you if you're right or wrong, maybe explain a little bit. Then she has to come up with something about you. 

It's great because it forces each of you to really analyse each other and invest in each other. These guesses show you what she sees in you, and you can use them to show her what you see in her. You can turn it sexy, or smart, or deep, or shallow, whatever you want. It's fun and engaging and it really gets her thinking about you."
Be angry without women thinking I'm going to hurt them. It really hurts to be lumped into the same category as domestic abusers.
"He left me for his ex girlfriend and completely broke my heart. It was the first and thankfully only time I laid in bed and experienced the whole *can't eat, can't sleep* thing. We only dated for a summer but I never fully got over him.

"I don't want to bring you down but I might: living unsuccessfully, to me, is fucking hell.

I'm unemployed, I have a useless degree in media design, and flunked out of film school in the last year. My old classmates are buying houses and going on expensive holidays while I live off of depressionbux.

I feel like a worthless person. I realize that, in my current condition, I'd be doing society a favor by tying myself to a strong beam. My parents are ashamed of me and the rest of the family looks at me with pity, I'm a blemish on an otherwise well functioning unit.

In all honesty, none of it is about the money. It's about the lack of direction and identity. I hear people fearfully saying they don't want to end up working in a supermarket all their lives but at this point, I wish I could."
Yes :)

Sharing clothes is something I never even thought of with same sex partners... What a cute/convenient bonus !! 
"It's all about falling short of expectations.  You need to recalibrate.  

I would like to tell you the (true) story about the two sons of a coworker.

My coworker a divorced mother of two bipolar boys.  I've known her for 20 years now and her life has been a tragedy of epic proportions - but this isn't about her. It's about her boys.

Both bipolar boys - like really bipolar have taken very different tracks in life.  The older has a master's in accounting from Northeastern and is quite smart.  Like clockwork he goes off his meds every two years or so and winds up in psyche.  

He's the successful one.  His mother co-signed his college loans to the tune of $50,000.  Loans she now has to repay because he can't work.  He's in jail.

He went to Northeastern and then went to work, in turn, at each of the big 4 accounting firms.  He was fired by each in under a year.  So, he moved back to his home town and started doing taxes (he's a cpa).    The last time he want off his meds instead of having a manic episode and winding up in psyche he decided to walk into a house in Greenwich (richest neighborhood in the country) looking for gas for his car.  Husband wasn't home, wife panics - there's an unstable guy in her house looking in the fridge for gas.  Cops are called, he panics and fights with the cops and he gets arrested.  Long story short he wound up in jail because he had an old offense for smoking weed and if there's one thing the greenwich prosecutor hates it's randoms walking into the houses of the seriously rich and picking a fight with law enforcement.  He will never work professionally, again.

Her younger son (he's probably 26 or so now) is the failure.  He's been on his meds since he was 12 or 13, I think. He's also really smart and he works in a grocery store.  He works with a group of friends for a year or so and then they all quit and take off for parts unknown (climbing in the western national parks, hiking and scuba diving in Australia, tramping across europe and staying in youth hostels)  until their money runs out and then they come back and do it all over again.  Happiest bunch of guys you'd want to meet. Life is an adventure to be lived to it's fullest.  Even if you work in a grocery store.

Think about recalibrating you life.  'Failure' is something that you perceive in yourself.

"Yep, female bisexuality  and experimenting &gt; male bisexuality and male experimenting.

A woman experimenting with another woman wouldn't really have a problem afterward if she still identifies as straight, people would just say ""Oh it's fine, she experimented but she still like men !"".

For men, it's another thing, it's the ""magic dick"" power, at the minute you were involved with another dick, boom, you're either gay or bisexual, but most definitely gay because everyone knows that ""bisexuals men are only gay men in the closet !!!"", there isn't a ""yeah well he experimented but still like women"", nope, you're doomed, from the moment you touched a dick, you're gay or bisexual.

This is a very stupid double standart, maybe it comes from  the idea that lesbian sex isn't real sex or whatever so lesbian aren't really lesbian, they're just fooling around till they meet a real man.

While on the other hand male on male is definitely gay sex 

Plus bisexuals get shit from the straight and the gay community, on one hand, they're not straight enough, on the other hand, they're not gay enough."

"Probably pretty common. Not like sex ed really ever covers it (unless you get lucky enough to have a teacher who thinks it's important).

I see posts about it online often enough to show that it's a real problem at least.

Edit: To address the last paragraph

&gt; Is this something most men actually think, and how on Earth do they believe this makes biological sense? Even if sex changed the vagina permanently (which it doesn't), why on earth would the number of partners, as opposed to the actual amount of sex, be the issue?

My *guess* is it probably started as some form of slut shaming way back in the past and everyone that heard it after either never gave it much thought or knew exactly what it was and went along with it (probably a little of this and a little of that).

Only other reason I can think of is people just process being with more partners as having more sex."

This dude was pretty damn low on the attractiveness totem pole and these girls were really cute and genuinely sweet to him. And he punished them for it."

"I'll chime in as a slightly older dude who used to feel like most of the guys in this thread.

Emotional development doesn't happen by itself. Many of us are brought up in environments that shield us from extreme emotional situations, and as guys we are often told ""man up, don't be so sensitive"" by our father figures and as a result we learn to avoid emotions. For me specifically, it was never that I was ""insensitive"" only that I became adept at *avoiding* any situation that would connect me emotionally to anything, and anything that I did encounter that effected me, I would distance myself from so quickly that it never really registered as anything deeper than ""stress."" This was my default state for a long time without me even realizing it, through all my teens and on through my 20's.

Planes crash into the World Trade Center? Blah, that sucks. On with my day. Grandparent or aunt dies? Oh well, such is life. New niece? Cute. When's dinner?

But something happens somewhere between being set adrift into the real world and becoming responsible for the feelings of others. A slow and gradual shift that is kind of scary and you may find yourself trying to push it away. That niece who was born becomes a little older and starts clinging to your hand and looking up at you like a hero everywhere you go. You realize after a few arguments with your SO that you aren't the ""cool, mature one"" in your relationship, that your behavior is going to jeopardize the only good things you have made for yourself. You begin to feel time slipping away and those twinges of stress become stark moments of terror that make your eyes fly open in the middle of the night. Mortality begins to feel far more real than it ever did before. 

You will lose things. You may have lost things before, maybe those things weren't essential to your life and comfort and you didn't worry because you had a support system then and knew you would be fine. Now, as you get older, you realize you are becoming the support system for others, and losses are up to you to manage and solve. You will learn that you will not accomplish your goals in life. You will have to find new meaning and purpose.

By the time I had gone through my 30's and had dealt with losing a home, a vehicle, losing my parents and family members to drinking, nearly losing myself to drinking, gaining a new family and nieces and nephews who adored me, navigating all the pitfalls and perils of marriage and changing my focus in life to make sure that my own home and environment were a sanctuary and doing everything I can to fight for that peace, I now find myself an emotional eggshell. 

I'll break down from an emotional movie as soon as the music gets sappy. Small children and animals overwhelm me. I cry for the losses that others experience. And you know what?

It's great. It really does feel good after a while to let this emotional state in. I don't have anyone who will condemn me for crying while reading a book or talking baby-talk to a kitten. It's like a high of sorts, but it takes time to get here.

edit: I'll add a thanks for the gold and an addendum that it's almost the 9/11 anniversary again. It's become one of the hardest days of the year for me.

"Not me, good friend:

He was banging Vicky, who used to be a Hooters waitress.  She was smoking hot, 18, and crazy as they come.  Parents were practically hillbillies.

One day they have sex, then after they have sex again, and he goes raw for just a minute or two, then gets a condom.  First time he never used a condom.

Voila!  She's pregnant.  Never mind he's a good looking guy, making 6 figures, and she's trailer trash.  Never mind she - oops - just happened to hook up with some other guy about the same time of his mishap.  Never mind - oops - she got totally wasted and fucked her dealer around the same time too.  Both of those guys didn't use condoms.

No, it was absolutely Chris' baby.

Chris (buddy) was distraught, to say the least.  Months of drama, more than I can even begin to detail.  Short story, he paid something like $1k for an early DNA test.

Turned out to be her dealers baby.  

The best part was watching her FB page.  It went from elation and posts on Pinterest of the most awesome house and nursery ever ... to her calling all her friends pieces of shit and watch her slowly spiral into misery.  Then she went offline for about a year, and came back, bitching about all the other guys who just were using her.  Then she moved to CA and began blabbing about how strong she was as a single mother.

Complete fucking trainwreck.  My buddy said it was worth every penny to not have to wait 10 months for the kid to be born and *then* do the paternity test."
Oh man that's rough ... That's gonna be one of those moments she'll remember once every six months for the rest of her life while standing in the shower cringing at how bad it was.

"&gt; Have you ever told a friend or family member who was, lack of better terms, unattractive and unsatisfied with being single to go for girls or guys that are more in their league? How did that go?

No, but I've read about guys who settled for someone they weren't attracted to, and it wasn't pretty. Like, unable to get it up after trying to have sex multiple times, that sort of thing.

Honestly, it seems like a bad idea to significantly lower your standards in general. Even I don't particularly want someone to date me if they aren't attracted to me, and I'm a pretty fucking lonely dude. I think most people feel the same way. Feigning interest in someone you aren't attracted to is as much a disservice to *them* as it is to you. Why waste their time like that?"

"It wasn't a priority at the time. When he was born, he ended up aspirating meconium and spent three weeks in the NICU. I tried to avoid the conversation because I suspected she may have cheated and I wanted to get a definitive answer before I signed. I don't think she cared too much about it because I don't remember her ever bringing it up. I think she wanted full rights to the kid anyway and that may have been easier if no one had signed it. There was a huge, nasty argument when I asked for the paternity test though."

Like she was that overcome with lust/a crush from afar that her friends were like ""go ask him out!"" instead of ""ohhh I hope he asks you out!"" and she got the courage to come over and strike up a convo with the hopes of taking me out.  I can't imagine how flattered and taken back I'd be.  I'd love that so much if it was more split down the middle: you were just as likely to be asked out by a girl as she is to be asked out by you.

"She slowly stopped replying to me after the first date until it got to a point where she was just flat out ignoring me.  We had pretty good sex, and overall it was one of the better dates I've been on.

I can still vividly recall two parts from the own experience.  One was where she, quietly, almost sounding scared, asked me to spend the night.  The second was after I'd walked out her front door and she called after me.  I turned around and she was leaning out her door, robe pinned closed with her left hand.  She waved goodbye with the prettiest smile on her face.

And, if I can be lewd for a second, holy fucking shit.  She was crazy stupid god damn hot.  Like.  Holy shit.  I've lost fifty pounds since then and I'd still say she's probably out of my league."

There are some people, men and women, who are really into the social media ""thing."" They have a public Twitter, maybe a YT channel, might stream on Twitch, and so on. If they want to share that hobby/lifestyle with someone, for them it could be a red flag.   

But ultimately this is no different from any other taste-based red flag (e.g. ""A woman said they don't listen to music, red flag!"" or ""A woman said she hates movies with subtitles red flag!"").    

""Incompatibility"" is likely a better term than ""red flag"" for this type of issue however.   "

But being online a lot and participating in many online communities which are demonstrably hostile to women that pop up in them (less so today than a decade ago, at least) has really showed me just how little respect a lot of men have for women.

It's hard to get into specifics, because it's more a general feeling that occasionally gets reinforced by the type of shit I see people say on reddit and elsewhere. And sadly, attempting to challenge the shitty things many people say just leads into an endless back and forth, so I've largely given up even bothering."

"I see your point. But when I hear ""social media"" my mind goes to places like IG, Twitter, Facebook, etc. since those are places where people have accounts that usually show pics of themselves, social connections with ppl in their day to day lives, and generally are used as an extension of their person on the internet.

I think of reddit more as a big message board/discussion forum. No doubt social interactions happens here, but I wouldn't tell anyone that I was looking to stay in contact with in real life to hit me up on Reddit. 

I guess the tie in to my real-world personality is what makes the distinction different to me."

"Everyone seems to think I want people to PM me their ex-gf's boobs because I like revenge porn or something. That's simply not true, though. I would be plenty happy if a girl PMed me her boobs too, you know? I just like boobs in general. 

The only reasons I explicitly ask for boobs from dudes is because

1. There seem to be more dudes on reddit.

2. My posts seem to appeal more to dudes.

3. boobs

Furthermore, I'm perfectly happy with things that aren't boobs, too. In fact, I've gone through several iterations of PM_ME names where I asked women to PM me different things. I tried giving things in return (like limericks) and I even tried asking for things that are not explicitly sexual like lips and tongues (cuz that's my fetish, don't judge me). None of that stuff really worked very well, so I ended up with this name. I'd still be happy to see that stuff or lots of other things too, though.

I truly hope this dispels some of the misconceptions about my username.

"A vagina made of gold.   

If we got in a fight, it would stop in angry sex. If we had a relaxing and fun day, it was interrupted with sex 3 or 4 times. If sex wasn't spontaneous, we would bring bottles of water with us to our rooms so that we can hydrate during. I would be on top and get thirsty. Then I would sit up, never leaving the inside of her, grab my water bottle and drink half then pass it to her so she could finish it before continuing. 

Truth is she was awful and we were not good for each other but the highs were so high that it clouded the rest. Bad can be fixed but something that good feels like it can never be found again. "

"I took a human sexuality course with a professor who had controversial research on the topic (the class was later canceled after he held a live demonstration of a ""fucksaw"")

Anyway, some of the research tried to measure bisexuality in men and women who identified as bisexual. This was measured in two ways. First, a subject would look at an image of straight/gay porn and would self-report if they were sexually aroused by the image. Second, the physical reactions of the subject's body was recorded for the same image (penis plethysmograph measuring change in dick volume for men, measuring how engorged the vagina gets for women).

The results were as follows: while women seemed to be sexually aroused by ANY image, men who identified as bisexual were mainly physically aroused for only one or the other, despite what they self-reported.

This has been some of the only research into this topic for a long time, so I think that may have contributed to the idea that ""bisexuality is just a stop on the way to gay town"".

As a gay man, most gay guys go through the ""maybe I'm bi! Yeah, that's it... I'm bi! (Please!)"" phase during the coming-out/figuring yourself out process. Speaking personally, after much effort I came to terms with the fact that I am not in fact bi. That's probably why when a guy claims to be bi most gays would automatically jump to the assumption that he's ""in denial"" and insecure about admitting who he truly is, which is a turn off."
"Would it not come up before that?

""Tell me about yourself""? ""What? Sorry my hearing's not great""?

Most people probably wouldn't care unless maybe they knew you for a while and you never mentioned it."

"Sometimes, when I wake up I like to imagine what the happily married ""dad"" me would be like, based on my childhood memories - like when I used to run to my parents room on weekend mornings as soon as dad opened the door to go and make coffees to jump on the bed and snuggle up next to mom. Or falling asleep, remote in hand while watching TV and watching my mom come up to my dad, gently wake him up and lead him off to bed. Or mom and dad tucking my sister and I into bed while reading stories. 

I'd like to do all of those things someday. I wouldn't call it baby fever as such, more as re-enacting some of the most humanizing memories of my parents from my childhood. I could only hope to be a tenth as awesome as they are at it, but then I realize that their experience of parenthood was all on the fly,too - I guess it means that I have the chance to be an awesome dad if I wanted to be, so I'd like to see what that's like.

2.  Clean at least one room a night, so when they get back the house is basically clean.

"For me, this changed when I had kids. I used to be the most stoic, seemingly emotionless dude ever. If you ever got an emotional response from me it was anger if anything.

Most recently, I gave a friend of mine a handjob and he nutted all over my expensive G710 keyboard. I am unequivocally OCD about the cleanliness of my keyboard, so this was a massive bummer.

This is a small sample. My IQ drops faster than my tights when my libido kicks in, so I have lots of sexual derp to chat about."

So close to being attractive to women.

I find the idea of a closeted gay kid utilising their parents conservatism to secretly bum their boyfriend. Someone should make a film about it or something. 
"Yes.

It did not go well. She arrived late, happened to run into a guy from her college at the restaurant we were at and then decided to leave me alone at the table to go chat him up for a bit. He was trying to have his own date at the time and was actually annoyed by her presence. I guess that she *might've* had a crush on him in the past, but his companion at the time wasn't pleased about it either. 

I, being alone at my table, had a nice meal (like fuck am I going to pass up a chicken biryani), paid for what I ordered and left. She didn't even notice.

My friend, having found out what happened was quite mortified and hasn't (thankfully) tried to set me up since. "

"The light coming off your eyes (what everybody sees) goes through the shades, bounces off the mirror, then comes *back through the shades* and into your eyes where you see it. So it's been darkened twice. To everybody else, it only gets darkened once. So looking in a mirror is not a reliable gauge for how well your gaze will be picked up by others."
It's great. When you start dating someone with similar sizes you effectively double your wardrobe.

When's the wedding?

Let’s dispel once and for all with this fiction that I don’t know what I'm doing. I know exactly what I'm doing.
"She's my best friend, she's married, she isn't my wife"
"Maybe I'm wrong, but that sounds like a really shitty thing for your bf to say - that he's not sure whether he can stop himself from cheating on you because he is sexually attracted to this chick. He sounds like a dirtbag based on that alone, but I'm sure there's more to him than that...

As to your question, I'm able to fully trust my girlfriend of 4 years because she doesn't tell me there's a chance she's going to go sit down on someone else's penis. "
"Congratulations! Don't forget to eat something before the wedding, and at the reception! Oh, and don't lock your knees when you're in front with her and the celebrant. ;) "
Opposite of a red flag. My interest would be piqued.
"A lot of ladies lead with this because some guys won't take no for an answer and move on. So what deters some of these guys away is ""knowing"" that another guy is with her.

While it's easy to get annoyed with someone who isn't straight forward, she has no way of knowing if you'll be the pissy punk who will berate her and/or not leave her alone even after she tells you no. I don't how many of you have had to deal with pathetic jackasses who can't take no for an answer, since most of you are straight guys, and given the numbers of guys on here, I assume that some number of you guys are the very assholes for whom this preemptive cutoff is meant. Guys of this nature aren't just pathetic in their inability to take no for an answer; they can be, at best, creepy, and at worst be actual threats to someone's safety."
"from what i've seen, women are often very turned off by bisexual men. it's a huuuuuge dealbreaker for the majority of women, even for bisexual women i've known. bisexual women i've known often don't understand why they feel that way, but they do feel very strongly about it. one bisexual women said that she felt afraid that a bisexual guy might be more likely to cheat with other men since gay men tend to be much more aggressive than women. the idea of competing with with men and women for a guy's attention seemed to make her feel insecure and jealous. it makes sense; it's just plain easier to find sex with men than it is with women.

my guess is that there are a lot more bi curious men out there than we know, but they aren't open about it because we all know that it would disgust a lot of their prospective female partners. not only would they risk being hated by homophobics by being openly bi, they would also greatly reduce their female dating pool. keeping it on the down low would make life simpler, and that's easier than ever nowadays with the internet. "
"&gt; So I shouldn't worry about him going out to bars and talking about hot girls with his friends?

Straight guys will talk about women, not constantly all the time, but it happens. I've overheard women at bars discussing men and how hot they think they are. It's just something people do.

&gt; Do guys talk shit about their girlfriends to their friends?

Yeah, we do. I know women do the same damn thing. Sometimes it's just blowing off steam after a fight, sometimes it's to make themselves look cool to their friends, or any other number of reasons. 95% of the time it's harmless, passes through, and doesn't mean anything in the end. The other 5% of the time it's the beginning of the road to a break up. It's sad but it happens. In the situation you mentioned I'm fairly sure it's him trying to seem cool to his ""bros"".

&gt; He also lies a lot about what he's doing. Like he'll say he's at home alone but he'll be at his friend's drinking. 

There's a hundred different reasons for this from harmless to hateful and I don't feel comfortable commenting on it. I will say that if you feel like he's being dishonest to you then you're free to move on and find someone you're more comfortable with.

&gt; Are those things guys do? Was I too stupid and blind before now to see my other exes doing this? 

The shit talking yeah, it happens just like it happens with anyone else in a relationship. I'm sure you yourself have had a bitch session or two about a man you're dating to your friends. It's natural to blow off steam with friends.

You're not stupid. Don't think of yourself as stupid. You're a person just like everyone else and you're not going to be perfect all the time so don't beat yourself up. Remember, you're human."
Jesus Christ they are totally different things!
"Ask another girl and get rejected again. Then do it again and again. Eventually you'll get a date, and it will suck. The next one will probably suck too. Then you'll get rejected again, and then you'll get another date and it will go well and you'll see her again, and that date will suck. 

Over time you'll get rejected less, you'll have more good dates than bad, and if you're lucky the bad dates will stop completely."
"I think the important part is reading their cues before and after you approach them.  Like, if they have headphones on or seem to be working really intently, then don't approach them.  If you do approach but they give really short and curt answers, then move on. As long as you're respectful and not pushy, then you're fine.

I also lost weight. I gained a LOT of weight after my last break up. It's been a year now and I've lost 105 lbs, I think I started testing the waters with dating after losing 60. I like fit men and it was totally hypocritical of me to be chasing guys with muscles when I was a hot mess. I'm so much more confident now which makes dating a lot easier too. "

We are in school together but she's the fuck buddy a famous WR in the NFL. 
"Outside our relationship, she was seen as very quiet, shy, non-engaging, boring to some. She was absolutely beautiful and I don't say that lightly or in a way to brag. She modelled and if she wanted she could go far. With her looks and her quiet ways, she was seen as stuck up by so many. Some people commented on that in a negative way and I put them down for that and even now, after a horrible break up, I still do. They didn't see her for who she was.

She was bubbly, loud around me and constantly talking, a complete contrast. She made me laugh so much, so easily and readily. That's very difficult to me, because I used to be insulted and bullied over my laugh and I stopped laughing for years and just smiled instead. She would come up with so many ridiculous thoughts that I'd tease her over and pat her cheek while saying ""Pretty face"" and we'd both laugh. We had so many inside jokes that I actually still automatically say some to myself during certain situations.

She wouldn't show she cared through words. But if you needed, she'd listen without talking, she'd just take me into her house and let me stay during bad times and just wanted to snuggle. The coldness she appeared to send off was just due to how she was raised. She wasn't Irish and it's really hard to truly become one of us if you weren't born here and her culture was far more reserved than us. She was deeply caring. 

So even now, I tell people to fuck off when they say shit about her. They didn't know her.

"At 32 I was seriously unsuccessful and maybe depressed. I made artwork, which is my calling in life, but worked as an accountant and really hated that large piece of my life. I'd quit my band 2 years previous, and lost a big piece of my social life that had existed for 10 years.  
  
Then my wife left me.   
  
But in that bad-to-worse turn of events, I was freed from any connections to anyone. I took a lower paying job that gave me much more free time and dedicated myself to art. I did some heavy meditation and narrowed my career aspirations and focus.  
  
Learning to believe in myself again was a huge life improvement, I was able to re-envision a future. Then I started dating, met my current wife, we bought a home (in NYC, another dream realized!) and have two kids.   
  
I'm 37, and still learning how to balance my day job, family, and art aspirations, but I made a lot of headway in those in-between years, I have fans, and a good life that is more well rounded than just a career.

"Nuh uh, I'll be the rude one.There's times when it's okay to be shameless, as long as it's in the right setting. Singing with your friends in the car isn't so bad.

 I dealt with my sister wayyy to long and got too many looks from strangers. But nooo I couldn't say anything or she'd lash out and say I comment too much. Sometimes it's good to listen to advice. She became ""that girl"" at university because she belted out while studying in a busy cafeteria every day.

I play drums but I keep my rhythms to myself in public even though I'm expressive because I know no one wants to hear me tapping things. Having some social awareness to how you're impacting others is something I'm very in tune to and value greatly. "
"Honestly a lot of men do believe this, I have heard it a lot. Why?
Probably because of the stuff they heard from other men growing up.

"We laugh about that pretty often. We'll go out to dinner, have a nice conversation while we wait for our food, then go dead silent while we eat. Once the food's eaten, conversation will resume. "
"It can definitely be frustrating when people who have everything going for them walk casually into success, but ultimately, resentment is toxic. You just got to let go of what you can't control."
"It was difficult at first just because there was a learning curve and adjustment period. They were already dating each other,  I met her through work and we hit it off, later she introduced me to her bf and we also hit it off. We hung out more and more end finally I opened up to them and asked them out which they accepted shortly after we officially started dating. I never really had trouble communicating with them but had trouble getting them to communicate with me which they are much better at now. 

As far as spending time together, we live together now so we tend to do things together. Even when we didn't live together most of our dates were group dates with the occasional one on one date.

I'm a few years older than them and have had more life experience so they tend to see me as much older than them."
"You can either sign the birth certificate or not. If you do then you get legal rights and legal responsibilities, if you don't then you have to fight for legal rights and get taken to court for the legal responsibilities.    

Some states in the US will require you to pay child support if you sign the birth certificate **even if you aren't the genetic father**. They claim you took responsibility for the child and thus unless someone else agrees to take on that responsibility (like the actual genetic father), you'll be on the line from 0-18 years.   

They can also claim that you took responsibility though various other ways (e.g. living with the child for a significant period, being at the birth, staying after you found out the true paternity, etc). Effectively the whole system is a ""trap."" But fortunately paternity fraud is fairly rare (much more rare than you'd think reading Reddit or similar).   

For example in Canada the rate is 4.0%, France 2.8%, UK 1.4-1.6%, and, Switzerland 0.8%. The 30% figure you read about sometimes is utterly debunked (and was from a period before genetic testing became commonplace).    "
"She married some Asian guy and from all account is pretty happy. Since she was on an impossibly high pedestal to begin with, I'm happy to keep her there in my memories anyway."
"This is exactly right. As a bisexual man, I feel like I constantly have to prove to both men and women that I'm not more prone to be unfaithful just because I like both sexes. I've often been rejected solely because of my sexual orientation.

To some, bisexuality just doesn't exists. They think I'm in denial or just experimenting. A lot of bi men just prefer to say they're gay or straight, depending on the situation. "
"Yugioh, fuck if i know, but my nigga stratos is prolly still banned"
"Too many variables to give a definitive answer. If I'm into her and she starts spilling the beans how she likes me and wants to hang out and yadda yadda yadda, I'm assuming she also feels that way while sober. If she's like ""come over"" I generally assume that's the alcohol talking.

If it's someone I'm not into, I just kinda do the ""haha yeah"" type of replies until they fall asleep. Or just stop replying"

"I actually compliment the clothes my female coworkers wear a lot at work. Sometimes I'll tell them outright it's great on them, other days I comment on the color or style (those days I'm usually ""window shopping"" clothes for my girlfriend lol), but it's pretty well received. Assuming you aren't a dweeb who just stares at their ass or breasts while you compliment them... Haha

Just a quick, ""Heather, your outfit is really cute today!"" and keep moving. Haha

Although, I'm not really big and burly. People describe me as a little bear. So. 

"
"You mean today? Discipline is something we all need every day, sometimes without realizing it."
"What? No! Just no! 

There are a few effects in sunglasses. Those that are not polarized look exactly the same to outside observers, except that the whole scene is darker. The contrast (which is what matters for seeing a dark iris next to a bright face) is unaffected.

For polarized sunglasses you get an interesting effect because the glasses typically absorb horizontally polarized light and transmit vertically polarized light. It does this because most low angle glare (from roads and water certainly) is horizontally polarized because physics.

The light coming from your eye is unpolarized because your eye is a decent diffuser, but passing through your sunglasses, it becomes polarized. When bouncing off the mirror, the linear polarization is unchanged so when it hits your glasses the second time, almost all the light gets through.

This means your glasses will look MORE transparent to you in the mirror than they are to an observer without polarized glasses.

Of course, if the observer has glasses polarized in the same direction (all polarized glasses block horizontally polarized light or they'd just be making glare twice as bad), they'll see the same lower contrast (brighter) eyes as you saw in the mirror!

In NO case will the face you see in the mirror be LESS visible (have higher contrast) than it is for observers.

Source: degree in optical physics.

Side note, this leads to the obvious conclusion that if you have to creepily stare at women (you don't, cut it out!) Picking unpolarized glasses might be a better strategy, because there is no way to ""defeat"" the eye hiding properties of unpolarized glasses the way polarized glasses can defeat some of the hiding from other polarized glasses.

Second side note: i mentioned contrast a lot because that's what matters most. Your eye can only see a certain dynamic range without dilating or relaxing the pupil. You're trying to get your eyes as dark as possible compared to your face and the surrounding landscape.

Practically, this means you want both sunglasses AND shadows, so face away from the sun because the light that does illuminate your eyes decreases the contrast and makes them far more visible.

But seriously, just look away. It's rude, it will make it harder to actually interact with beautiful women (because you're training yourself to stare) and you gain nothing you couldn't get online."
Blink twice if you are in danger
"Nah he had just left like less than 5 mins prior. Sorry if I gave the impression that he was in ear shot. 

It was an American couple I met in Guatemala. I'm British and she kept going on about my accent, we were pretty coked up and husband goes to bed and we stay in this touristy bar. She then basically just goes for it and start outrageously hitting on me. I mean she was pretty hot but the fact that her husband had just gone to bed not 5 mins prior made me so uncomfortable  "

"Lol one can certainly rationalize anything!

A nice career isn't only lucrative, it's fulfilling and enjoyable too. Sure you shouldn't compare yourself to others but don't fool yourself, a good career and success in that area is a lot more than marketing. 

And money... well, having money is awesome. It's really quite extraordinary to earn well above average. It's exactly as good as people think it is.

"Enjoy the experience you had. Don't over think it.

"My cousin's best friend had this happen. He was a junior and just accepted into a pretty competitive engineering program at NC State, had a lot going for him. His sorority girlfriend (they were both in Greek life) found out she was pregnant so he dropped out after his fall semester, and started taking classes part time and working at a dealership as a mechanic (admittedly it was a pretty dope job, he made a lot for his age, but nothing compared to the prospects he would've had with a degree). 

So anyway, kid comes, all is well and good, she's finishing up college and he's working to provide for the family, no suspicions at all on his part. A few months after the baby is born, they find out he has cerebral palsy. So he has a pretty long road of surgeries and likely being confined to a wheelchair ahead of him which is obviously terrible for him, but EXPENSIVE for the parents.

So my cousin's friend just had to drop out altogether and work two jobs to save for/afford just medical and disability related stuff. Sticks around for about two years and works his ass off. About two years after the kid is born he saw a Facebook conversion left up on his gf's (fiance at this point) laptop when his girlfriend was at work. It was with this dude who was hitting her up that she was actually telling to leave her alone, but the conversation made it obvious that were hooking up at the same time she was dating him. So he basically read the entire three year conversation that went back to around the time she got pregnant and before.

Long story short, he freaked out, she said that she was only hooking up with him before she got pregnant (which was actually true and corroborated by the Facebook convo, he was just hitting her up constantly), he orders a paternity test and the kid's not his. From what I've heard since then, she's a single mom now and is working on sueing the actual father for child support. But until then, he has been helping out financially with ""his"" son because he feels like a moral obligation to... which... I mean I understand and is very noble, but I feel like if his kid was ""normal"" he would be out the door. It's just a shitty situation (and this all went down pretty recently).

Edit: a few words, I'm on mobile"

"I'm 5'10"" and I dated a girl who's 4'11"" for a little while. First time we kissed, I missed and ended up smooching her nose. I always thought it was cute when she stood on her toes to kiss me.

"A male friend had recently (within the month) lost a sibling. While a group of close friends (all in our late 20's) where hanging out, he broke down. Another girl and I both went over to him. I put my arm around him and hugged him. Simultaneously, the other girl pat him on the back and told him he needed to get control of himself (the man up approach). I wanted to shove her away so bad. But he did a very manly thing. He turned away from her and buried himself in my arms, sobbing. I'd honestly never had more respect for a man. He gave zero f's about what she said or who was watching and did what he needed to do. The men in the room seemed slightly uncomfortable, but never gave him a bad time about it. He cried it out, dried his eyes and said, ""someone get me a drink"". Everyone laughed, then it was like it never happened."
"Those two things aren't exclusive. 

Men are indeed attracted to all kinds of women. The proof of this is easy to find: for every kind of woman - blonde brunette tall short shaved hairy old young black white - there are entire web sites of porn dedicated to them. And yes that includes your body type.

That doesn't mean all men are attracted to all women. Men are just as sophisticated and subtle in their attractions as women. So any given man can be attracted to a small range of body types and derogatory about others. Women do this too. It's normal. "

"&gt; lots of sex equates to a flappy vagina

People forget vaginas don't think ""this is a different dick I had last time, must strech out"". 

You could have one partner for years, have sex 5 times a day, but somehow having a few ONS will make your vagina loose?

Dick is a dick. Vagina doesn't know if you had Bill's dick 100x or there were dicks from Andy, Tom, John, Mark, Antonio, etc. "
"I enjoy dating tremendously. There is no end goal for me, dating itself is fun. I also skip all the dinner and movie kind of shit.

Because our culture has a strong preference to how you can appear masculine. Bisexuality is seen as lowering your perceived masculinity. That's my 2 cents anyway.
"fake kidnapped an ex once, gagged and hogtied her in the trunk, drove out in the woods and was super rough. She said after the fact she never had orgasms that intense. Same ex also liked being flogged on certain tender bits and in general loved it rough. "

"I know that feeling. I dated a girl, and I don't think I'll ever stop loving her. Even if I'm over her, and even though I'm 90% sure she doesn't feel the same way, there's always going to be that small part of me that loves her until I die."
