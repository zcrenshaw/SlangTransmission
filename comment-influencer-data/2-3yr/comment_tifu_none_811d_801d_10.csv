Don't you just hate unexpected business trips?
"Eh, I'd rather just be married until I die than avoid an awkward conversation."
"I always question people who leave cum in the open.

Now I question people who leave cum in the open and have paternal instincts for the cockroaches that are attracted to it."
"What is it with people cumming in weird places? First cum box, then the guy who always came on his carpet. Now we got Lord of the Cockroaches over here cumming on his wall. "
This sub never fails to weird me out at times.
I worked with a guy that took acid and forgot he worked that night. It was awesome. I was the only one that knew. We worked at a steakhouse and I probably asked him to go grab me one potato at least 20 times. One of the best nights ever.
"""Dude, you don't even work here"""
At first I thought this was about a tool for baking buns for hamburgers and such. 
"Jeez. I think you should have just said something later, rather than just going with it, or at least talked to her about it."

"The update needs to be from the ppl at the gym and his coworkers.

""Today, I saw a guy looking in the wall mirror and flexing his fingers like he was working out. He then walked onto the treadmill, turned around and stood on it backwards for 25 minutes. He finally dunked his head in the water fountain and left wearing a gym t-shirt and a tie. I think he stole my jeans.""

""Today my male coworker came back from his lunch break wearing a t-shirt, tie and women's jeans. He grabbed Tricia, who has worked here for 10 years, and walked her around introducing her to everyone as Pauline. He got no one else's name right, except the potted plant that we all call Fernicus. He asked Joe, who is 5'6"", ""how's the weather up there, big guy?"" while looking at a spot one foot above his head and cracked up laughing at his own joke. Then he sat at his desk for 3 hours, staring into his trash can."""
"Silica gel isn't poisonous to humans either. The bag says ""Do not eat"" because the bag itself is a choking hazard.

One of my coworkers had a similar situation the other day. He was pretty normal except I would catch him staring at the salad greens a little longer than usual.

"As a teacher, I both hate and love this. 

On one hand it is hilarious, on the other hand it would be rage inducing. Kids have no idea the paperwork and legal repercussions of them getting hurt on our watch. "
...how often does this guy normally stare at the salad greens..?
"4 beers later, I'm coming down and it's time to make my way home.  I left the bartender a sizeable tip =3. If you guys want some advice then I say:  i plan on eating a sandwich. "
"Drove to class. Took the bus back to my dorm. Had to go out later, spent 10 min looking for car. Couldn't find it so called the campus police. 15 min later they called saying they found it outside of where I had class earlier. Biggest and most stressful brain fart I've ever experienced "

Aaaand I think that's enough Reddit for tonight. 
That is the most important lesson on edibles. Give them at least an hour before you eat more! I've heard way too many stories about impatient people going off the deep end lol. 
life gets a little lonely sometimes
"Last time I took acid all the plants tripped me out. 

I kept thinking about how plants are machines that convert water, sunlight, and minerals into plant matter. They  grow and grow and nothing tells them to grow, they just do it. Plants are machines that can die. 

My stapler, I accidentally dropped it on concrete in the parking lot. It never stapled properly after the accident. I killed it, I killed a machine, a machine that I loved. I could've fixed it, brought it back to life, but I didn't because it was easier to replace it. 

Did I really love my stapler? I felt love for it, but then I chose to replace it instead of bringing it back to life. My stapler was dead and I prefered it that way. 

The universe loves us but its simply easier to replace us with someone else than to repair our broken relationship at the end; so we die. 

We experience this love death and replacement over and over again throughout our lives even if we are too busy living to notice it. The universe shows us this so we will understand that it loves us, despite it's intention to discard us instead of repairing us.    




**Edit: This is blowing up. Please everyone do me a huge favor by doing something nice for a stranger tomorrow.**

It's easy, just smile at them. Maybe give a nod or a wave, and wish them a good day. It'll make everyone happier: you, me, the universe. We need more happy.  "

that's why she fainted. the paperwork. 
"OP please give us updates on how you're going. For the laughs, and not your wellbeing, of course."
I have never heard of this scam. But it looks like a ploy to get your son out of the house to rob it.
I was hoping you meant the other acid

"Wife had knee surgery and when she woke up said she was hungry. I asked what she wanted to eat, and she said ""Herc"", which was the name of my brother's dog. o.o I asked ""You want to eat the dog""? She replied with a confirming nod. Definitely some weird stuff. I've never let her live it down. "

Shit. And here I am thinking I fucked up for ordering way too much salad for a meeting. 
Sorry I don't know what a potato is.
"""As the night janitor, I occasionally see employees working late to meet a deadline.  Tonight was different.  A male employee was in the kitchen, completely naked, kneeling in front of the refrigerator with the door open.  As I entered the room, he was drinking mayonnaise straight out of the squeeze bottle.  He stopped, looked at me and said, 'Here is your tip.'  He then proceeded to hand me a pair of women's jeans.  As I left the room, he crawled into the cupboard below the sink with a sandwich."""
You missed your flight to take your dog to the vet. You are a good person.
He fucking owes you man. He probably didn't care about the whole problem up until you threatened him and then he got karma (unfortunately you breathed it in too) by breathing in the fumes.
"Pro tip, ravioli is great for infected wisdom teeth, it posts through barely parted lips like it was designed purely for that purpose.  And you can eat it by smushing it against the roof of your mouth with your tongue so no chewing. 

I don't like soup so it was a life saver for me, but for those that DO like soup it can be nice to have something a little more solid. I lived on the tinned stuff in tomato sauce for about a week.

Heat applied to the jaw can help soothe too.  Hope you feel better soon."
"After reading all that, I'm just still so impressed by the fact you grabbed your phone charger before heading to the ER. 

As someone who's terminally ill and spends LOTS of time in the hospital, I've got a small bag of stuff I grab anytime I go to the ER, even if it's for a seemingly minor issue that won't require an overnight stay, because invariably I always end up staying somehow. And #1 on that list is my phone charger (and my headphones). 

I know you said you work in the medical field so that's probably how you know, but when I was new to this whole process, I spent many a night in the hospital with nothing to do but watch 24 hours of basic cable programming. Ugh. There wasn't enough pain medicine in the world to make that tolerable. "
"I think the defense mechanism of the body is to stop the lungs from working. It was almost instant, I didn't think I'd breathed enough to reach the lungs. There was no immediate effect but I'm getting older and my lungs aren't as good, I look back to that and wonder. It was like my lungs just turned off. It wasn't painful, even the lack of breath wasn't like holding your breath where you have an urge to breathe."
"Jeez man, are you alright? What health risks does breathing that stuff in pose?

"So the first time I took LSD I attempted to start a bonfire in my backyard. I am told - ""there you went, back and forth, throwing something on the fire-less logs.. Then going back and doing it again"".

What I was in fact doing was filling a cup with gasoline in the shed, and then passively walking over 20 yards to the fire pit to get it going.

What my apparent observers did not know was that the reason I was repeating these steps continually was because every time I got to the fire pit my cup had literally disappeared from my hand...

...what I didn't realize (until far too long) was I had been filling up Styrofoam cups and by the time I had gotten to the fire pit the cup had dissolved from the gasoline........

.......

Edit: well since this is my top comment allow me to preface by stating this was about ten years ago and I was quite the dumbass. I like to think I've made better decisions in my life since then, but this could easily be my worst.

I've told this story before, and it is in fact the first time anyone pointed out the napalm fact. Maybe I won't tell this story anymore..."
You know you've taken enough acid in your life if you can remain semi-functional when high.

"Man, if you don't want to get married, don't get married. Feeling awkward about taking it back now is a really bad reason to do this. It's not fair to either you or your fiancée to start a marriage this way. She deserves to be married to someone who can't wait to marry her. "

"I get the feeling that people in this thread have not taken acid, or have only tried it once. The first time on acid makes it seem impossible that anyone could ever act normal on it, but usually after the 2nd or 3rd try most people can keep a handle on it, assuming they're on a dose they've taken before.

An experienced observer could probably notice the pupils and the sweating, but an experienced observer would probably just give you the under the table thumbs up anyway.

(but yes be proud, anyone who can handle their acid, especially in an unexpected situation, gets respect from me)"
Should I be proud of this? 
Now *that* will be noticed. 
Having genitals that bleed monthly really sucks. But on the other hand my genitals have never tried to strangle themselves to death which is nice.

That's the strangest rendition of the holocaust I think I've ever witnessed. 
Once I realized what happened I grinned uncontrollably for 5 minutes then I panicked.  Working out also helped. Luckily it was a slow day at work and I had minimal contact with the outside world although I'll definitely need to review my emails tomorrow. Currently drinking some beers at the local watering hole to take the edge off. Acting very normal.

"""Seriously dude, just one potato!""  
""I want these cheeeseburgers!""
""Fuck dude, come on I NEED A POTATO!"""
"Judging by the context, I am guessing the girl roommate is your mom, and the other roommate is your dad. "

This should be the name of a cocktail."
It least OP has arms to jerk off with 
If you are already looking down your nose at her because you think you won't get fucked as regularly or that she might gain some weight do her a favor and take the ring back. You don't view her  like you love her dude. If my husband came at me with that fear I would just leave. I'm a human being not a Barbie. I can't stay young and beautiful forever no matter how much I try and it's heart breaking to think a lot of men would drop you because of something you can't prevent. 
I call them groovy bears.
Wasn't there also a guy on an askreddit thread who said he always imagined his GF as a giant cockroach while fucking her?
"Yeah, idk who licks walls and sees dragons on acid. More realistically he'd stare at the wall way too long because it's wavy, and maybe notice that coffee stain he sees every day slightly resembles a dragon."

"I've never seen someone write ""2/3"" as ""2 3rd"" and it's fucking with me. "
"I swear there was a past TIFU about some guy doing the same exact ""turn and aim at the wall and ejaculate"" move. I was certain I was reading a copypasta but then the whole cockroach thing just took it in a whole different direction."
"This sort of makes me want to recount the time when I was 4 and found my mother's vibrator in a drawer. I played with it for a while. I don't remember what I was pretending the vibrator was when I stuck it in my mouth, but I stuck it in my mouth. I liked the sound it made in my head when I touched it to my teeth, especially the back ones. It tickled and made the roof of my mouth itch. Many years passed before I realized what I'd done, and even now, decades later, dildos still trigger that memory. As do athletic protectors apparently."
I feel like OP is implying he showed the bartender his testicles as a tip.

"Woah, woah, woah.....Teachers get paid?"
