"&gt; One quick one, Morty.Just a little belch bash.

Do you mind just adding a quick space in there? Thanks.

hey its me ur psychologist 
"There's a jewish pedophile who just lost  his job, book deal, and bookings for condoning sex between a 13 year old and a 28 year old who's now bitching that it's all being blown out of proportion by leftwingers and the media. "

"Flat, planar surfaces are all around great at resisting any state of matter so yea, great broscience with the ""square hull"" comment."
More than likely driving a SUV and they are short so they would need a booster seat to properly see their full blind spot.
"Haha, I howled at this!"
"What? It's not a country to anybody. And if they say it is, they're totally wrong."

You couldn't just answer?
More like they would be caught brown handed...potatoes grow well in feces
"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, he could've just typed that into his browser and gotten the answer instantly."
"Even the most scummy human on earth and space is worth more than an animal.

Except for dogs. Dogs are superior to all humans."
That's called a cash advance and you can't do that without the credit card company knowing your intention.
"i'm replying to the guys question:
&gt;..OK? What constitutes a real college?"
"Dude, I put ""Convict"" as part of his name for a reason. Gory stuff aside, he seems like a genuinely nice person. "

"Despite what this thread full of people who insist they hate iTunes says, iTunes is not garbage, and runs fine. 

Could it be optimised better? Probably. Is it bad? No, not really.

Also, no, QT is optional."
"Canada has craft?
"
what an amazing design.
"&gt;just now really becoming a true science

*snicker*...*snurgle*...*chortle*.....BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...*wipes eyes*....

Ah, oh man, that was a good one. Thanks for the laugh....

"Well, to be honest, the college bit could be true as you tell it, but it sounds a lot like ""didn't put enough effort into pushing them"". Sometimes, one can't just think bureacracy will work out, one has to make it work out."
"Yes, it is and incredibly selfish too.  Yes, she would be forced to ""carry the kid she doesn't want for 9 months"".  That is an extremely small thing to end a life over in my opinion.  

A human life is worth so little to you that you think it is reasonable to erase a potential person's very existence in order to avoid discomfort for 9 months? 

I'm pro-choice too but denying a child a life, and someone you formerly cared about a chance to become a father, is an incredibly short-sighted and selfish decision in my book."
should've done Engineering or comp sci
"Well, umm... see... the anti-trumpites haven't actually *dealt* with him. They just know what Bill Maher tells them. "
"... It's already proven? There are scientific studies on it, bud."
Of course. Hillary Clinton is evil. She was going to push us into WW3 with Russia and China. She panders to blacks and is funded by people in Saudi Arabia who will chop your head off for being gay. She lied about all the Benghazi stuff and on top of all of that is just an overall weak person. Always having coughing fits and passing out all over the place. We dodged a huge bullet. You may not like Trump but Hillary Clinton is straight up evil
I sincerely doubt your need for a check went straight to Trumps desk. 
But but but but but but but REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE *liberal autistic screeching*
Actions speak louder than words. What has trump done for gay people?
This quote mind controls the player! Spoiler!
"&gt; nobody is hurt by this even a tiny bit

But the *kid*, though. ðŸ˜’

Oh yeah, the kid doesn't count.  My bad!!!

"That's like my strict Hindu friend.

Goes to a BBQ joint, Sushi place, Kebab place and asks for vegetarian.

FFS. Gets really annoying especially when our Texan friend comes along and sees him asking about vegetarian."
"I would reevaluate your ""friendship"" with this person. Who the fuck says ""you didn't get hired because of your looks"" after this friend referred you, nonetheless. Wow. "
Done by muslims
and how do you know that ? dont spout random shit just to make yourself feel better 
Why don't you cry about it a little more?  Maybe that wii make you feel better?
"I mean, was there an option to save them? (edit: the answer is ""yes,"" there was an option. So ignore the rest of what I said.) If there was and he opted not to use it, then yeah.  But if there would have been nothing he could do regardless I can't see how to reasonable blame him. 

That said, the ship should have had an option.  Whether that's his fault or the company he worked for is another topic, though. 

edit2: are you guys just downvoting out of spite now? "
"Definitely wasn't talking about that, that's gross"
"You don't know that she was brainwashed as a child, so stop assuming. Obviously people didn't tell me my whole life that ""killing is good."" Obviously some killing is always good, and some killing is bad. I'm just saying that the circumstances involved in someone's death didn't force me to project the circumstances that allowed it to happen onto other people like a fucking tard. 

This woman is definitely evil. OP said so: she's religious. Religious people are invariably evil since they believe in killing everyone who doesn't believe the same thing they do, which isn't the good kind of killing."

"I'm Asian, if that counts. 
I'm in my final year of school and I'm quite sure that studying isn't tough if you're consistent throughout the year, instead of studying just before the finals. "
"If I'm wrong I'm wrong, no big deal. This discussion isn't even about what's a square and what's a rectangle though, but reddit will jump on anything to feel smart I suppose."
Haha that's not what happened.  
"I probably shouldn't open up this can of worms... but why? I could somewhat understand how one could support Trump before the election, but how could anyone possibly agree with what he's done after taking office?"
Wanna bet :O  you're in the dining room right now. Just about to eat some delicious pasta with tomato sauce.

I hate you. 
"Well. It would probably be a better end to their lives than living in self-pity. I guess. 

Myself though. I don't consider someone alive until they can form memories."
"[Damn you got me.](http://i135.photobucket.com/albums/q137/jaridgibbs/seagal1.gif)

"ah yes of course, being offended by double standards, as a man im not allowed to do that. women are though right?"
actually it's kind of creepy.
"As bad as the girls can be, anytime the guys make any noise is the worst."

"I agree that the law itself should be changed, but probation for breaking a law is pretty standard, no?

At the very least, unless we have specific legislation that separates marijuana from more serious drugs, it's good that people are forced to do something about their issues, even if the vast majority won't stop doing them. "
"the ""thats what a loving godly husband would do"" part didn't tip you off as to the /s?

yeesh"
"I agree, for the most part. I got whooped as a kid, and have been told I'm a great adult. I attribute my personality and demeanor to the way I was brought up."
People who excuse the hyper-sensitivity by claiming everyone ELSE is insensitive.
That's not a secret
"&gt;Going clubbing. 

Only if we're talking baby seals. That other kind sucks. "
"Well that is interesting but only makes the title even more odd. Shouldn't the title be something like I am not a negro I am a man. Or the origin of negro. The title as it is makes no sense I'm not YOUR negro makes it sound like he's making a distinction of whose negro he is. I honestly thought maybe he was trying to ""own"" it. hence the curiosity.

But since it seems like it provides no new insight for me. I'll take your word for it."

"Hopefully I can ask these questions without sounding condescending. I am not trying to put anyones beliefs down simply questioning them the Socratic way.

Id like firstly to establish a set of terms here, the most important being that God does not equate to religion. To me religion is a man made creation to help EXPLAIN the ways of god (whether you agree or disagree with those explanations is not my concern)

Secondly that God has absolutely no reason to exist as an entity confined to any laws we may put on said entity. 

When people say they do not believe in God because of a lack of ""proof"" I sit there and wonder what other form of proof do they need aside from literally everything in the universe existing. 

Science is the concept that Everything has an explanation. You can create tests that through trial and error become less falsifiable. 

The creation of the Universe needs an explanation. To think the Universe came from nothing is to state that Science has no way of proving it. If Science cant prove it then it is no longer Science.

God gives Science the necessary beginning for the Universe, for Science to continue to work the way it has been working since the creation of the universe  
 
I've never really had anyone argue with me on this so id love to hear your thoughts in a nice and friendly manner why you believe what you do and what i could possibly be wrong with."
