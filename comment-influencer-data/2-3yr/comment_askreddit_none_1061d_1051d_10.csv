Because they're not adoption shelters. They are where people take their unwanted pets that other shelter won't take. It would be strange if their euthanasia rate *wasnt* high.
Well Bill Clinton did and he got elected twice by the same people who are now bashing Trump!

"How about just not do illegal drugs? I'll never have any pity for guys that wanna smoke hella weed or pop pills and then be like ""aw man I got fired from my job..."" ""oh that sucks, why?"" ""I had an accident at work because I was high and then failed a drug test man!"" No shit, maybe you shouldn't have been hot boxing in your car in the fucking parking lot of your job before you went into work you absolute ignoramus, just because you have tinted windows and a sun shade up does not mean that we do not know. We can smell you. 

Sorry, rant over. Seriously though, no pity for people who either lose or can't get jobs that they want because of drug use. Yeah, weed should be legal, but it's not yet, so if you wanna play in the grownup world, you gotta play by the rules."
"As soon as we arrest Hillary.  They're in bed with her after all.  So never, basically - too hooked up just like she is."

So you're reposting my [most upvoted and commented post of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4c75vw/which_celebrities_killed_their_careers_in_a/) huh? Even with the same title.

I'm aware of Buddy Holly and The Crickets and the history of Rock N Roll. I wrote what you read. I think you're alone in arguing that they are the starting point of Rock N Roll.

"People saying ""catch my train"" or ""be healthier"".
Do you understand that 30 seconds of wait time on an escaltor cut to 15 because you walked up it isnt much to brag about.

Why did you need those 15 seconds to catch your train?
Are you really that untimely?

Why did you need those 15 seconds of workout?
Are you really that unhealthy?

Get over yourself.
Some people have trouble walking up stairs, therefore they don't.
Some people enjoy time to think about what they need to do, while the escalator climbs the stairs for them.

They're not being lazy, they're being smart, unlike the barbarians that NEED to rush through life because they cannot comprehend time management.

If you want to ""stay fit"" by only walking up inclines, THEN TAKE THE STAIRS.
If you want to ""get to my destination on time"", THEN YOU PROBABLY SHOULD OF LEFT 5 MINUTES EARLIER.

For people that don't understand the irony of the joke it's, people who walk up escalators feel like they are saving time, but in reality, the reason they need to walk up them in the first place, is because they fail at managing time.
So again the ironic question is asked.
What do you do with all your extra time?
Because it's most definitely not ""be on time"" or ""stay fit"" if you can't even manage to catch a train.

I mean, there's a reason why they don't allow rollerskates at airports ;)"
"Heeeey guuuurl, pretty username ;)"
It should still be guilty until proven innocent though. However I do not condone that type of behavior and if he is a rapist he should be punished accordingly. 
Why so? Maybe use it as a compliment.
"Christ, what bad friends you guys had. I remember my friend in 5th grade sprained his ankle and I sprinted all the way back to his house to tell his parents. I lost a shoe on the way."

"Please, men are just adapting to women. Women in general want a man who's stronger, smarter, and/or richer than her or she's not going to stay interested in him. We're just avoiding wasting our time investing in someone who's going to bail anyways.  

Edit: The downvotes always come from the same women doing this, whenever I hear this in real life it's from a woman who's aggressively looking for a man who's stronger, smarter, and richer than her. Last one has little money herself but when she got married married a rich investment banker. One before that, a surgeon. They'd both go on and on about how money didn't matter and men were ""intimidated"" by a ""strong"" woman etc etc. As a generalization there are some exceptions, but the women complaining on and on about this are never the ones who are the exception.

"You can flush them.

One at a time. Which is what it says on all the packages I've seen.

If you flush too many at once then yes you run the risk of them bundling up and clogging up a pipe."
"No shame in any of it. Agreed, if you want to deceive other people that should be your choice. I leave fake ATM receipts around my apartment and it's remarkable the difference it makes in my sex life once the women see that side of me."
"What are you some kind of shill for a drug company?

Grow a brain and read a few older books.  This information is in the Bible, it's in Shakespeare's plays, and many famous paintings.  

I hope you choke on those pills."

"I kind of agree with your friend in a way. It happened, they lost but it was how life was back then. Many cultures have been conquered and wiped out. The latest generation is very understanding and empathetic by and large.

Edit. I see I'm getting downvotes, can someone explain why this is a bad point of view?"
"It's also how criminals and sociopaths get made. Irresponsible breeding is the greatest harm humanity does. Those children end up with less of a solid foundation and still contribute to global climate change and the mass extinction event humans are causing. Such a harmful thing to do. People should only breed if it's a net positive and for most people it simply isn't.

Hitler's greatest crime against humanity was ruining eugenics for ethical people."

You're gonna try to read more about the fact that buildings falling by explosives look the same as buildings falling from a different type of explosive? OKay.

"If there isn't a bike lane, find another fucking road to bike on. It's not the drivers putting lives in danger, it's you. Roads do or don't have bike lanes and passing zones for a reason. People are trying to get where they need to be. Could be work, to a loved one, or even to the hospital with someone in pain in tow. The road is for cars. The bike lane is for bikes, fuck you. "
Others did so you wouldn't be forced to. Have some god damn sympathy for the guys who came back all fucked up.
