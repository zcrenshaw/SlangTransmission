"Child of divorce, professional who dealt with divorcing couples for many years, Adult who went through a divorce, remarried and volunteer counseling/mentoring for couples today.

Here are the most common mistakes I've seen (my own as well as collectively) in the failed and struggling marriages I've seen:

* One or both spouses have unresolved childhood baggage issues that will rear its head in their adult relationships.  Examples of these include (but not limited to) physical or emotional abuse/neglect in the home; sexual abuse; one or both parents had substance abuse/addiction issues; one or both partners came from a divorced or single parent household.  Among the many reasons why this is such a significant factor is if you grow up in a dysfunctional environment, you have no idea how dysfunctional and unhealthy it really is.  To you, its normal, it is all you've ever known.  So if Mom and Dad resolved conflict by getting drunk, yelling at each other and then not speaking for days, guess what you have a chance of modeling as an adult in your own relationships?  

* Understanding what ""marriage as a priority"" really means.  When you get married, your marriage has to be the main priority in your life.  Not your career, not your spouse (i.e. don't put them on a pedestal), not your kids, not your hobbies or your personal fitness.  The fact is, when you get married, you no longer get to call all of the shots.  Gotten used to staying up all night playing XBOX with your boys on weekends?  Not going to work in a marriage for an extended period of time.  You're going to have to accept the fact that if you want to have a healthy marriage, compromise is your new word of the day.  In some cases you may have to give things up entirely, or learn to say ""no for now.""  While this often tends to be more of a struggle for men, women can also struggle with this issue.  I'm not saying that getting married means giving up you completely, or kiss all of your favorite activities goodbye.  What I am saying is, if you want your marriage to be healthy, you now have someone else in your life who gets an equal (not dominant--equal) say in how you spend your free time.  

* Poor communication skills.  A shockingly high number of adults lack basic healthy communication skills and conflict resolution skills.  Its heart breaking to have conversations with struggling couples who won't speak to each other with a kind word for any reason.  Both spouses should feel that their marriage is the one safe place in the world for each other.  Unfortunately, in many instances, it is the last place a spouse can go for emotional safety.  If you don't feel your partner is your first friend, your best friend, your most trusted friend, then something is broken in your communications with each other.  

* Vastly different backgrounds.  Don't get me wrong.  Anyone can be successfully married to someone else if both people are committed to it and willing to work on it.  But most of the time, that's just not the case.  Societal/familial pressures are real, and it is important to assess them if you find yourself  in a relationship that is impacted by them.  Are you dating a trust fund baby/very wealthy child and you are the Jack Dawson?  Tread carefully.  It makes a great movie, but statistically, Rose winds up marrying Cal far more often than running off with Jack, because she doesn't want to deal with the family pressure or get cut off financially.  Sorry, that's reality, not the movies.  

* Similar to different backgrounds, different motivations in life.  Do you know what your partner wants out of life?  Do they aspire to be an artist who welds clown sculptures out of mufflers?  That's great, but will it support the two of you, and if it won't, will you be okay supporting them while they're making Pennywise the Dual Exhaust Killer? Do they want to be a stay at home parent?  Are you okay being the sole breadwinner?  What if it is the reverse?  

* One.  Union.  Combined. Together.  This notion is one that I see a lot of guys--especially high wage earners who are the sole income for the family--stumble over.  Whether you are religious or not, the fact is when you get married you are no longer two individuals.  You're one.  The law sees you that way, the tax code (at least in the US) sees you that way, and society sees you that way.  There is no such thing as ""mine and yours"" in a marriage.  There is only ""ours.""  The faster you get that concept nailed down, the better off you'll be.  I've seen many marriages collapse just over this issue alone.

* Marriage is not an event, its a journey.  So many couples stop trying to pursue each other after the wedding day.  Guys and girls do this.  Stereotypically/historically, men tend to focus on their careers/making money;  women tend to focus on raising the children and/or managing the household.  (I realize not in every situation)  Both spouses stop taking time to compliment each other, appreciate each other, go out on dates, weekend getaways, or generally just spending time chasing after each other.  They take each other for granted and begin to drift apart.  ""We just fell out of love"" is one of the most common phrases I hear in couples struggling, and the sad thing is, its one of the easiest traps to avoid.  

* Friends and family around the marriage.  This is especially hard for people who come from dysfunctional families.  When you get married, your new spouse automatically gets moved to the front of the line.  In front of your parents, siblings, lifelong besties, etc.  They're great to have in your life, but all of them have to take a distant back seat to your new spouse.  If you're a guy who has had a doting mother all your life and she's told you what to do, who to marry, where to go to college, etc, you have a tough job ahead of you.  The Monster-In-Law stereotype exists for a reason.  If your new wife turns pale when your Mom's number pops up on your cellphone, you need to talk to your wife and find out what boundaries she'd like to have installed.  If you are Daddy's little girl and nobody has ever been good enough in your Dad's eyes, its time for you to tell Dad that you're so grateful for his love and support, but Jim is more than good enough in your eyes, so you need him to be in his eyes, too. And sadly, if you have friends or family members who are toxic to you or your marriage, you may be forced to make a very difficult decision in your life.  Anyone who sits around bitching about how much they hate their life, their spouse, their kids or how you're going to eventually feel the same way about yours--put distance between you as fast as you possibly can.  We tend to adopt the attitudes of the company we keep.  So if you spend all your time with negative people...guess where you're going to be mentally?

* Date to establish trust.  Time is actually your friend, not your enemy.  Do not ignore ANY red flag you see in a relationship.  Examine it for what it is, then determine if it is something you can work through with the other person, or is it something they refuse to acknowledge or deal with?  If you're dating someone who is selfish and they refuse to see it, they will not magically become unselfish because you were kind enough to marry them.  ***Red Flags ignored in dating will become the rocks upon which your marriage boat smashes in the coming storms.***  If there are multiple red flags and they won't talk to you about any of them, walk away.  It doesn't matter if you've already moved in, share the bank account, the dog, and a car.  Get out now.  If they're not willing to work on things that impact the security of a relationship today, you can count on them not working on them after you get married.


Marriage is not easy.  It requires a lot of work sometimes, even when you are both on the same page, have great communication, great sex (which will happen very easily if the rest of the relationship is healthy by the way) and great chemistry.  People get sick, they get laid off, their family members die, children get sick, get hurt in accidents, friends have affairs, get divorced...life is challenging and it impacts our relationships, sometimes in ways we're not expecting or prepared for.  If you're not willing to value your marriage above everything else in your life, its going to be really hard for it to survive the day in and day out challenges of living.

"That crazy girls are better in bed. The girls who have been best in bed in my experience have all been completely normal, if kinky, people, and I didn't have to worry about being stabbed with a fork later."
Being fat.
Right? Here I was thinking (yet again) that the Americans have a funny way of doing things.
That women are naturally better parents than men. So many women aren't fit to raise children. Not saying that more men are either. Basically most people in general shouldn't be allowed to have children and the fault is 50-50 
Give me a break. I put  Axe spray on and a bunch of incredibly attractive women ripped my shirt off when I was walking to my car.

"Some people marry the ""best"" partner they can get - on paper, the best looking, smartest, most talented, etc - rather than the most compatible. Rookie mistake, but a common one."
"Not so much a stereotype, but the all-pervasive idea that their looks determine their worth as a person.

My sister has always been pretty, and she's always had a long line of guys climbing over each other to help her out with every little thing. But when she got cancer a few years back and her looks started to go a bit? Or when her long, gorgeous hair all fell out and she looked like one of Jerry's Kids? None of those motherfuckers were anywhere to be found. She couldn't even get some of these guys to answer the damn phone for a ride when she was too sick to drive herself. That's just one extreme example, but I know every last one of you has seen this phenomena writ small just about every day of your lives.

Look, I get that beauty is important. There's an extent to which we all do, and in fact should, judge one another by their looks. But we put such an out-sized amount of importance on it when it comes to women that it becomes the single most defining feature of how her life is going to go. By comparison, all men have to do is make sure we aren't complete slobs and we're good to go for most occasions.

It's not just that it's unfair, it fucks everything up for everybody. This is why women are so hard to approach, to the point that it takes forever to get to know them. This is why guys get strung along. This is why women seem catty and shallow sometimes. Just about every single damn complaint men have about women can be traced back to some coping mechanism they have had to develop in order to deal with this inescapable fact."
"As an older guy that gets mistaken for younger by younger women all the time, if you're definitely into a date then make it really clear. It's a huge pain the ass determining if something is just good service, playful flirting, outright cock teasing, or actual interest, and compounded if you're having to get their number where they work. No one wants to come off as the creepy old guy hitting on 20 yr olds, at least an older gentleman wouldn't want that. ""What are you up to this weekend?"" If the answer is not much or an opening is given ""There's this movie (whatever) that I really want to see"" keeping in mind that going to a club or whatever until 5 in the morning is probably not going to be high on his list of ideal dates. If you have your number already written down, then he'll understand you thought about it and planned it out. A lot of times I won't move on someone younger than me unless it's crystal clear that they want to find out. "
"Recently met a former gf from a long time ago. We had a great love story for a few years but it did not work out at the end, we split and have not seen each other since.  
I mean, like for 24 years. 
Now she is married, professional, still beautiful, and she tells me *I have been thinking of your dick all my life*. 
What does one say to that?

"Stopped smoking weed. Feel less lethargic saving money more motivated.

Not saying weed is bad I love that shit but the side effects are definitely psychological and when you are a young man without having his shit together it's detrimental to your growth."
"I can't tell you exactly what to do, but I can tell you what not to do.

* Do not stick the entire length of your tongue in someone's mouth.
* If you do want to put your tongue in someone's mouth, for the love of God do not just put it in and leave it laying there. What am I supposed to do with that? 
* A closed-mouth kiss is how you kiss someone goodbye or goodnight. You cannot prolong or repeat a closed-mouth kiss. If you want to keep kissing, gonna have to learn some open-mouth technique.
* Your hands can and should roam over someone's body. Don't just stick to one spot and definitely don't stick to just boobs or ass. The whole body is exquisitely sensitive if you touch it right.

Kissing is the prelude to sex. You want it to be kinda wet and slippery with different kinds of pressure and contact as your parts move together."
"Not discussing expectations for the future prior to marriage/expecting that love is magical enough to make a marriage work on its own accord. Marriage takes work, not just love. 

Things to discuss:

* Children; how many to have, whether to have them, at what age you want to have them. Do you expect her to be a stay at home parent?

* Finances; if someone is the stay at home parent, what do you expect from her in terms of spending [it's going to cause friction if you spend ""your money"" on a new motorcycle but won't let her buy a new dress for herself for her friend's wedding because it's ""not her money.""] Do you have plans for retirement? What big financial purchases do you expect to make in your life (house, car, vacation home.) What do you think is a reasonable amount to spend on those things? Is one of you a frugal saver and the other a more luxurious ""spend it while you got it"" personality? 

* Sex; do you have absolute aspirations to have a threesome one day? Don't expect your vanilla spouse to suddenly fulfil all your fantasies post marriage. Are you going to be pissed if sex happens less than 3x a week sometimes? Especially when it comes to children, expect the sex to taper off for months and months and months, because newborns suck and so does giving birth.

* Life issues; does one of you want to move back to their home town to be closer to their parents? Does your sick sister expect you to be the Plan B parent for her kids if she passes away? What's your stance for these things?"

So:

**LIE ABOUT WHY YOU ARE ENDING IT WITH HIM.**

He will know that you are lying, but he will know that you are lying to avoid hurting his feelings/ego/dignity.

Also, **there is no way around this so that you can keep seeing him**. Imagine if a guy ended a sexual relationship with you because of, say, him finding your breasts to be a dealbreaker. Or him politely lying about it, but you knew it was obviously due to your deficiency in the breast department. But he told you that he wanted to keep you around as a friend, and you got to watch him start new sexual relationships with beautifully-titted women. Same thing - humiliating.

"That girls are catty or being in the friendzone with women sucks. Girls are *awesome* friends, and most of my friends are girls. 

Major event going on in your life? Girls will remember and ask you about it the day it happens. Feeling a little off? Girls will notice and be there to listen. Have a funny story? Girls will laugh and be entertained regardless of how good it actually ends up being. Inviting them over for something? Girls are bringing wine and baked goods. "

"First up, the obvious one: Anything. Guys hardly ever get compliments, for guys to get a sincere compliment is such a legitimate rarity that anything is good.

In particular, I always hope to get compliments on my hair, because my hair is natural dry and dandruff-prone, so I have to do a lot to even make it look presentable. 

Oh, big no-no though: be careful about how you phrase your compliments. ""Wow, you're tall!"" and ""I really like how tall you are!"" Will get taken completely different ways. In my own opinion, not about to speak on behalf of all men, but the first one is generally very, very offputting for me to hear, while the second one can make my day. Phrasing is very, very important when you're giving anyone compliments, but especially with guys, who are less likely to get them and more likely to scrutinize them."

"Here are a few books I would highly recommend for men (and women as well):

* [Wild at Heart](https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Heart-Revised-Updated-Discovering/dp/1400200393) by John Etheredge. For Men.  The companion book for Women is [Captivating](https://www.amazon.com/Captivating-Revised-Updated-Unveiling-Mystery/dp/1400200385). These are Christian books, discussing God's design for men and women.  Even if you are not a Christian and have no desire to be, I think you may find some of the discussion very revealing or at the very least intriguing.  These are not so much good ""learn to communicate"" books, as they are ""understanding who I really am on a basic level"" books.

* [Love and Respect](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Respect-Desires-Desperately-Needs/dp/1591451876) by Emerson Eggerichs.  Another Christian Book, this one on the biblical view of marriage.  Again, if you're not a Christian, I still recommend it as a resource for marriage.  There are some fundamental principles of marriage that transcend religion that can benefit both spouses.  For men and women.

* [Codependent No More](https://www.amazon.com/Codependent-No-More-Controlling-Yourself/dp/0894864025) by Melanie Beattie.  This book is *required reading* if you or your partner grew up in a household with an addict (parent or sibling), an abusive parent, or single parent/divorced home with high conflict.  It is not faith based, for men and women.

* [The 5 Love Languages](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X) by Gary Chapman.  This is a great book that breaks down how we're all different, and we get our needs in a relationship satisfied in different ways.  Understanding what your partner needs is fundamental to having a healthy relationship.

* [The Seven Principles For Making Marriage Work](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X) by John Gottman.  This is another great resource for understanding effective communication within an intimate relationship, whether you are male or female.

After that, if you have more specific issues in your story, like childhood trauma, there are more specific routes to go down.  I also strongly encourage enlisting the aid of a counselor, therapist, and/or pastoral counselor if you or your partner are struggling with childhood baggage.

"Ok, taking this as a low-key ""teach me how to be a kissing maestro"". I'll tell you what's worked for me.

0)Know the context. Know if you want to kiss her sweetly or aggressively based on what you want and what she'll respond to. This is absolutely critical.

1) if you're going for soft and cute, one hand on her hand one on the bottom of her chin. Pull up softly and lean in. Don't take more than a second or two with this. Pull back and grin a bit. 

2) if you're trying to be a bit rakish, but not totally pouncing on her yet, put both hands on her hips and push her back into a convenient wall, grab her hands, move them over her head, pinning them to the wall with one hand while the other goes back to her hip, put thigh against her crotch (firm enough to feel the heat, light enough that she can keep her legs together) lean in and go for it. A small tease of tongue is a possibility here.

3) if you want to ROCK HER GOD DAMN WORLD RIGHT NOW or are looking to descend into a slew of tongues and spit-smeared lipstick, one hand on back of head, with the proper hair-grabbing twist, same side leg goes around the outside of her legs, other hand goes to the small of her back. Pull her slightly across your thigh so she has to lean, yank her in and spread some germs."

Again, I don't remember doing this. It was at that point she knew I liked her and as far as cringe worthy awkward moments go that's about it. 

Oh, wait, the first time we met she came into the store to get another drug screening and background check form because her original was lost by the company. When she came in, the first time I saw her, I stammered over my words for about 3 minutes explaining to her something I could have summarized in a sentence.  "

"I've been a best man two times now, and been a part of running more than one wedding (I have a big family, don't judge), so here's the best advice I can give. It's super easy as long as you follow these simple rules:

 #1: **No Drama. Ever.** Yes, you are a part of the wedding party, but your opinion is completely meaningless. Nothing here is about you. You have no position from which to argue about anything. So just do whatever anyone asks you to do. This leads directly to rule 2.

 #2: **Do Anything and Everything People Need You To Do.** Your sole purpose is to make the bride and groom's lives easier. So if they need you to do something, no matter how stupid you might find it, you should just shut up and do it. Yours is to do, not to decide.

And finally #3: **When in Doubt, Show Up and Shut Up.** Be where you're supposed to be, when you're supposed to be there. Being late is the best way to get a mouth full from an over-stressed relative, which only makes the bride and/or groom more stressed. So don't be late, and if you've got nothing else to do, just stay out of everyone's way until you're needed for something. Oh, and answer your freaking phone, because if somebody can't find the groom the first person they'll call is you.

Quiet shy girls are usually just that in the sack: unconfident, unsure of what they're doing, and unwilling to communicate.  Sure they might let you do whatever you want, but usually its because they don't want to speak up about their own desires.  In my experience, the average woman who jogs 3 times a week, wears normal clothes and enjoys shitty TV shows (imo) have been the best at sex."

They're usually based on either breaking some taboo (e.g. incest, scat, cuckold), some quality of the sexual entity (huge boobs, grannies), have to do with control and/or sensations that aren't strictly pleasurable (BDSM of all sorts and asphyxiation) or are centred around some aspect of culture that's tied to sexuality (high heels, stockings).

This. I find women get really into the 'trying super hard to be sexy' wanting heaps of feedback on their exact clothing type, situation etc. But guys probably aren't super interested in that, all they want is enthusiastic sex. 

And not on some once off event either. Consistent enthusiastic sex that you get the impression she equally wants/enjoys it leads to strong attraction. Not some expensive costume. "

She wanted ice cream and he had some at his apartment and somehow they ended up over there having ice cream and fucking. Just a one night stand sort of thing. Ironically afterward she spread some pretty nasty rumors about his dick size and endurance level.

Like I said it wasn't my girlfriend or anything, but I was pretty pissed and our friendship was never quite the same again despite there never being any sort of confrontation or blow up over the incident.  In fact we're the only two in that friendship group that actually live in the same city and we don't speak. In hindsight she chose to do this so I can't exactly put the full weight of it on him either. "

He started inviting my gf to drinks and forgetting to invite me as well. 
She let me know and he acted like it was all a misunderstanding.
Time has passed and my gf of the time and myself broke up and are both in new relationships. 
I still talk to her and apparently he tried his luck with her as soon as we broke up, and when she turned him down tried to hook up with her bestfriend.

"The way I see it is, with everything going on in the world today I simply *have* to carry on a first encounter.

Best case scenario she's only a lesser lycanthrope and the moon isn't out, I can deal with their messiness and hunger. Chinese buffet, no big deal. Of course I never go on dates on full moon nights, but if you do be sure to use silver ammunition.
Vampires, gotta watch out for those. I'm open-minded, and vampirism isn't that big a deal to me anymore but really if she doesn't have her shit together you might be looking at a quick stab with a chopstick cross (tie two chopsticks into a cross using a drinking straw), or at worst a full-on battle with a vampire colony. Never had that happen, but you hear stories.

Now if she's any sort of demon, you have to ask yourself: Is it worth it? Yes they're hot (literally and figuratively), yes they're independent and won't be all up in their biz, but you know how demon culture is. It's a hierarchy, and if you're an outsider you're going to start at the very bottom. Good lucky trying to measure up to a shape-shifting Incubus from the Nether Realms. Also, they're not very trustworthy - come on, we ALL know it's true. It's not prejudice, it's just their culture. One minute you're engaged in a conversation, you take off to the bathroom, and you come back and the whole restaurant's souls have been sucked out and she left you with the bill.

Now any kind of Grecian or Sumerian chicks like Medusa or Lilitu or Ishtar, class acts, but high maintenance as hell. Still have to be careful, and guns won't do much, so be sure to choose your weapons carefully. Medusa and her kind don't fall for mirrors anymore, so you have to get creative, and if you catch a Sumerian goddess or demon queen on a bad day, you know not much else is going to work than a small nuclear explosion, preferably one with time-distortion effects to keep them from regenerating. Of course, they're not gonna like it if you show up to the restaurant smelling of radiation, so be sure to keep a small hand-nuke in the bathroom stall to use in an emergency.

It's really not that hard, just plan ahead and adjust to the girl and you should be fine, but it's always good to be prepared.

I think yours is one of the most important answers in this thread. It's surprising how many people rush into marriage expecting it to be all sunshine and rainbows.

"We had to make the decision to end our nine month old daughter's life.  She was born with a birth defect,  the surgeon botched the correction and it caused massive complications.  She had 12 surgeries total, 6 of which were brain surgeries,  she had a Trach and was on a ventilator.  After the second bout of meningitis the doctors all told us she was better off passing. It was the single worst thing to have ever happened to us. "
I would question why she wasn't upfront with me. Perhaps I could have changed that if she would've communicated her sexual needs. People that fake orgasms do more harm to themselves than to their partners.

"Thinking that your spouse will continue to do all the things that they were happy to do when they were trying to get you to marry them, once you have actually married them.  Too many people (in my experience, especially women) tend to look at marriage as the end goal, rather than the starting line.  If they think it is the finish line, they stop running once they cross it."
Then communicate better. Any other answer is just playing stupid mind games and will probably make things worse in the long run.

"Nope, it isn't hard to settle down.

The woman I'm about to marry is so far above every other woman I've ever met it's like comparing different species.

As soon as I started spending time with her, even just as a friend, I knew that she was a woman to walk the world with. Any passing interest I had in other women was just blown away. Like comparing a match to the sun.

Now this is obviously purely subjective to me, but that's my answer.  With the right partner, it's as easy as anything to be faithful."
"100%

If anything, having a moderately high number of partners (mid-20s) makes me less tempted. I've gotten to do all the different things I wanted to try, I've slept with women of all shapes and sizes, there's not really any mystery in terms of ""I wonder what that's like."" Yeah, there's always that temptation for someone new, but it's not any stronger now than it was when I was younger. I didn't cheat then and I don't plan on it in the future."

"Cancer. 

My wife is currently recovering from vaginal cancer. It's fucking terrible but we are hoping to hear ""cancer free"" in a couple of months.

What most people don't know is that the side effects of chemo and radiation are terrible but the worst part is  that some side effects can become permanent so we will be dealing with this for the rest of our lives.

She is 31 and has already had surgery on her cervix that was supposed to lower her risk but actual cancer in the vagina is pretty rare (as opposed to her ovaries or cervix) and women who do get it are typically over 50.

As the radiation has made it pretty much impossible for her to get pregnant I am thankful we have already had kids and I'm hoping to get ""back to normal"" by Christmas.

"I feel your pain man. My wife and I had just gotten to the beach house that my family rented for vacation late one night while everyone else was still sleeping. We had our only son, at the time, a shirt made that said ""Big Brother to Be"" or something to that effect as we had not told anyone that she was pregnant again and this was how we were going to surprise everyone. Well, she wakes me up early that next morning absolutely hysterical, this was before anyone else had woken up,  because she found out that she had been bleeding throughout the night. So, I woke up my oldest sister to watch our son so that we could rush to the ER. There we found out that she had miscarried. We went back to the beach house, packed up and went home. That was the longest yet shortest vacation ever. I am happy to say that we now have two sons, a 5 year old and a 9 month old, but it still doesn't hurt any less when I think about that time. "
"I had a very weird friendship when I was a kid. There was a guy in my class who was on paper almost exactly like me: short, bright hair and eyes, good student, athletic in some disciplines, but lousy in others (we were both great swimmers and strong for our size, but couldn't play ball for shit), his parents were also doctors, he even also had an older sister.  
As you can imagine, we had a very intense rivalry going on and by intense I mean that we used to just go at it with fists whenever one of us got too pissed with the other's success. The envy was completely out in the open, we used to literally tell each other things like ""Beat my time/score/record and it's on, fucker."" Looking back at it, I'm glad I knew him, not only because he was a great guy when we weren't hating each other, but also because he was a tenacious fighter and holding my own against him whenever we fought gave me the confidence in my fighting ability that helped me never get bullied again.

"In theory, sluts like to fuck, they enjoy every moment of it and they don't just get fucked, they fuck the guy back as well...

Be enthusiastic and act like his dick is the fountain of youth. Take control of your pleasure, and know when to be dominant and when to be a bit more submissive (submissive =/= starfish).

&gt;would you like it to continue out of the bedroom, say we're out one night and I just start acting a little slutty, but not pursuing anyone else kinda thing?

You'll need to ask him if that's something he's interested in. For example, you could dress more provocatively (show a little cleavage, side boob, underbutt, or more leg) &amp; y'all could pretend to be strangers at a bar/club, followed by a quickie in the bathroom or blowjob in the car. You could tie him up, blind fold him, and fuck him, or let him do the same to you. Maybe incorporate more dirty talk.

When you suck his dick, have fun with it, and don't treat it like a chore. 

One time I wore stockings with a skirt (innocently) and my guy friend told me he has a weak spot for them I was like lolwut so if you know he really likes a particular item, sex it up a bit. Could be a dress, high heels, going commando, g-string etc.

EDIT: I say in theory because I don't really like calling girls sluts and not all sluts are bomb in bed. Plenty just like to get fucked but don't reciprocate."
"Oh I have a great one about how I wingmanned for someone else to get myself laid.

I was at a party and there was a girl there I knew who I really wanted to hook up with. She was in attendance with her gay male friend. At one point while we were flirting or whatever I asked if she wanted to leave. She said she would, but she can't leave her gay friend behind at the party alone.

At that point a light went off in my head. One of my own gay buddies was at the party somewhere. I ran off to find him, brought him back and introduced the two gentleman. They hit it off and a few minutes later were making out. At that point, sufficiently convinced that her friend would be fine without her, the lady and I went back to her place.

The two guys actually ended up dating for a while, and thanked me for introducing them to one another."

"She sometimes gets into that mindset where she has to clean and rearrange my things and I hate it because usually it happens when we are in a hurry. I also have trouble finding things if they aren't where I put them. And she's like, your socks aren't in the same drawer anymore because of some weird reason.

After taking a shower, I need to get dressed very quickly. However, she will stick around in that half wet bathrobe for hours and say that she's cold and turn on the heater. I don't get it.

What I absolutely hate the most is when she puts washcloth or cleaning cloth on the faucets to dry them. This gets me really upset because I want to drink tap water and it is disgusting to have some stinky rags on them."
"Depends on your intentions I'd say. If you're planning on getting a little frisky etc, go loaded, as it gives you incentive and because there's more testosterone in you. If you want to just want to be chill, go unloaded and that pressure release. All of this also depends heavily on your libido."

"&gt; First up, the obvious one: Anything. Guys hardly ever get compliments, for guys to get a sincere compliment is such a legitimate rarity that anything is good.

&gt;In particular, I always hope to get compliments on my hair, because my hair is natural dry and dandruff-prone, so I have to do a lot to even make it look presentable. 

For real, there is this girl that I am so attracted to that I hadn't seen in a while. In that time I started working out, dressing nicer, and most notably, I'd always had a nice head of hair and I started styling it. I walk in the door with my friend and she totally ignores him as her jaw drops and she exclaims,  ""Oh my god, *Sandwiche*, your hair! You're gorgeous!""

I was so unbelievably caught off guard that I told her it was an accident, mumbled something about getting stuff from the car, gave her a quick hug without any eye contact and scooted right back out the door. I don't know if that reaction is why, but she hasn't complimented me since. Ugh"

I have made out with girls at parties, and even tried to have casual sex with one, but I backed out of it because I just couldn't get more intimate without the emotional feelings a relationship brings.

That's just crazy enough to work!

There was a girl I used to hook up with just for sex. We were both single but didn't have anything in common except sex. We were parked in an alley and  She is riding me in the backseat of a car reverse cowgirl and another couple just laid on the hood of my car and started having sex. We stopped and the girl on the hood looked up and locked eyes with the girl I was with for a good 5 seconds. We all just stopped. 
My husband and I had the same issue so we bought a second one but his is still somehow better. Probably because mine doesn't smell like him.
"Yes please.

"Going to go against the grain here:

That they don't need anyone or anything else.

You know how your dad was adamantly against having a pet?  Or how your friends don't want to get married?  Or how you can live as an island?

Well, we all love being loved.  Fathers that love their children or their pets even moreso than mothers.  Friends that have such great marriages that they cannot see themselves ever out of it.  Loners that find great women and are incredibly satisfied with their lives.

It's healthy to want such a thing."

"My kink is teasing and domination. 

Example. Recently getting with someone I do a lot of foreplay and I'll head down to the pussy. But I'll only lick around the clit and up and down the sides and barely flick it before coming up and kissing her.

Then I'll say let's spoon while watching a film and I'll slowly slide my dick up and down her pussy while she gets wetter and wetter and suddenly plunge it in, balls deep but I'll just cuddle and if she rocks her hips I'll hold her still and just let her get as wet as possible, just staying balls deep and cuddling, occssionally while kissing her neck and then I'll take it out and just really cuddle, while focusing the movie.

That'll repeat a lot, stuff like that. I have a will of god and won't break, she has to beg for my dick."

"I just told her. She rejected, and then I didn't have to worry anymore. It's quite liberaring to just tell. Best bet is to just ask people out instead of giving hints. I guess any flirtatious comments/compliments before asking the person out are hints enough.

"Personally, I still have insecurities about:

- Things above the neck. Being leaner has improved my face somewhat, but for the most part the appearance of a face is genetically determined, and no amount of exercise will improve the symmetry or proportions of my facial features. It also won't prevent balding, or clear the mild acne that persists even in my mid twenties.

- Sexual inexperience. To some degree I can bluff about this because people expect, based on my appearance, that I have an easy time getting women. However, bluffing doesn't fix the fact that I am terrible at detecting interest, expressing interest, and have no idea what I'm doing if things start getting serious."
"That if a woman has mostly male friends or doesn't get along with a lot of women it's because either she's a drama queen or wants the attention.

NO FUCKING GAS.

Do 2 laps, stopping and starting entirely with the clutch. (maybe a little brake if you must).

Now, speed up a bit in 1st, and shift to 2nd.  Do a lap. Stop.

Repeat, stop -&gt; 1st, 1st -&gt; 2nd -&gt; stop. Do this until your comfortable, then go for a drive around the neighborhood."

"When they just sit there with their hands in their lap or not using them to their full potential. Nothing is better than a hand on the face or hip, or changing it up by playing with the hair or tracing a finger down their back or even the inside of their thigh.

When they purse their lips and lean in too hard, causing a sort of pause in the kiss. The kiss should move very fluidly, never really pausing, changing and adapting.

Rookies tend to not use tongue that much because they're a bit intimidated. Start off with a little and you two will find your way.

Also, change it up. Pure kissing is fine, but I like to take breaks where I'll kiss down to their ears, neck, down to their collarbones and pull them in closer, while they run fingers through my hair.

Also if you're in a private area or just don't give a fuck, let her sit on you with her legs around you and its way more intimate. Positions change shit up."

"Self-esteem issues. A lot of these guys are late bloomers and don't *see* themselves as nice or attractive even if they actually are. Even after they've gotten their shit together, they're still perceiving themselves as a 17-year-old acne-scarred loser.  When you've gone through years of loneliness and finally find someone who likes you, it's hard to cut your losses and leave if that person turns out to be shitty. ""Hey, you remember those years of loneliness, self-loathing, and bitterness? You're going to go back to that over some silly overreaction? Who's overreacting here?""

Another thing is that emotional abuse usually goes up gradually, and you build up a tolerance. You didn't leave last month, and it's not *that* much worse this month, so you're probably not going to leave this month, either.

She's not an *especially* picky eater, but I'm a really adventurous eater, and this can be limiting. She particularly can't abide spicy food, which I crave. We sometimes cook parallel meals together, adjusting ingredients just to accommodate our preferences. I fully realize the counterpoint that I'm the annoying boyfriend who drowns everything in hot sauce and eats questionable leftovers.


This might sound like a bigger deal than it actually is, but she snoops through my texts, email, etc. if she uses one of my devices and I have these things open. She's freely admitted it without me asking and she isn't proud of the habit, I'm sure she doesn't actively look for anything out of suspicion, and I don't have anything to hide from her anyway--but it still feels inappropriate."

Overall, I love my art but I wish I would have known how welcome people would feel to my body simply because I have tattoos. I've had people (almost exclusively women) grab my arms and start twisting and turning them without so much as a warning. It's been just about the only issue I've faced being visibly tattooed but it's a huge pain in the ass and I've had to set multiple people in line about it. That said, go nuts. Tattoos have become much more widely accepted socially so don't worry about the corporate nerds getting you down."
"Wow, you put that all together really well. Thank you for getting it. I can't tell you how frustrating it is when guys say ""You don't *have* to care about your looks that much, it's a personal choice"" when I try to remind them that we are, from the day we are born, constantly bombarded with society's expectations of our appearances. To some degree, yes, we do make the conscious choice to adhere to it or ignore it, but a lot of what we make that decision based on are the experiences that have either scarred us into conforming to the standard or conditioned us to constantly think we need to improve. In the case of ""deciding not to care"", I've seen it most often applied by people who have just given the fuck up because they don't think they're pretty even if they try.

People *say* an awful lot of things don't matter, but as you saw with your sister, people's actions often imply that well, those shallow looks-based things *do* matter.


I hate having so much of my worth tied into my appearance. It's expensive in ways most guys can't even begin to imagine, it's time consuming, and if anything, because we're constantly evaluating how we look bit by bit (are my eyebrows shaped well, is my hair sitting right, is my makeup on point, does this shirt make me look all shapey?), we are constantly picking ourselves apart. We see the worst even when others don't, and it fucking hurts.


In the end, it's a choice to a degree, but society does treat you a certain way based on your looks, and women get a pretty heavy burden with that. I think you're very right in that this is the foundation for most problems we see between genders. I do see a lot of men complain that it's easier for a woman to find a guy than it is for a guy to find a woman, but in the end, we're constantly wondering if he's only interested in us because of some shallow reason. It's mostly a minority giving guys a bad name because they're ""players"" who pick up women with the same dedication you give to a burger you got in the drive through. Of course, there are plenty of women who use their looks to con guys out of buying them dinner and other shit, and then ditch them in the end, but all this damn pressure about people's looks fuels an awful lot of it.


People suck. Makes me glad to be dating the guy I have. He's never made a rude comment to me about how I look (my ex used to tell me I looked like a drowned rat when I got out of the shower, which of course only made me feel horrible and more attached to my makeup, which go figure he complained that he didn't like any makeup at all... asshole)."

"Not my relationship, but just want to be humblebrag and be proud of my brother. He's currently 19, as is his girlfriend, and they've been together almost 3 years now. Last year they both went away to college, both around 5 1/2 - 7 hours away from home, about 3 1/2 hours from each other. On the Thursday of her first week of classes, her mom fell on the stairs and hit her head. She came up home because things weren't looking good.

She texted my brother Friday saying she needed him. He dropped everything, emailed his coaches (he's on the diving team at school) and professors, and got home, went to the hospital, and was with her for about 30 minutes before they decided to turn off life support. He spent the whole weekend over at her house, helping her and her family out with everything they needed, cleaned, did things for them in the house or went and got food while they took care of the funeral and wake details. I was so proud of him that weekend.

It's not as bad as other people, but at 18, that's something you don't think you have to deal with anytime soon. He's continued to be there for her and he'll go and surprise her or ask someone in the family to reach out (me and my sister who's a year younger than me are close to her) when he knows she's having a hard time. It happened literally a week after being dropped off for college. They both handled it way better than I would have expected, especially him, as he can be a little boneheaded and dumb sometimes."

That girls are bad at math. I've met plenty of girls who were amazing at math and science but because of this stereotype they went off to do something other than math and science. It's a shame that talent like that goes to waste.

"That still seems like a bit of a diversion tactic to explaining his real reasoning. People with foot fetishes typically find the actual feet attractive, they don't just like what nice feet signify about other sexual things. Then again I'm not a foot fetishist so I suppose I don't have much authority to talk about the topic. 

But like.. Dude.. Foot jobs? Sucking on toes? I'm literally not evening right now. "

"My boyfriend rolls out of bed, goes to the closet, gets his clothes, comes back to bed, gets changed sitting on the bed and drops his jammies straight onto the floor next to his side of the bed. Even though I got an over the door hanger SPECIFICALLY FOR HIM TO HANG HIS SHIT ON. but no. He will forever and always just drop his clothes next to the bed. Drives me bonkers but I'm used to it now. Don't even notice it anymore. *twitches

He also monopolizes the entire bed, including my side. He says it's because he wants to be ""close"" to me while sleeping but there isn't even space for me...I wake up with half of my body hanging off the edge 😥

"Unfortunately, I haven't found it for myself yet. I have seen a few couples who lived this way, so I kind of know how it looks. They had shared values, even if their personalities were different. They used the same kind of decision making processes. They trusted each other, and were both trustworthy.

I remember a moment of clarity that helped me get out of my last relationship. The wife of one of my best friends was out of town for a few days. He commented on how much he missed her. This shocked me for a moment, because when I was away from my ex-wife for a few days I felt relief. I also noticed that he didn't miss her to a degree that prevented him from enjoying his life, he just felt disappointed that he couldn't spend with her when he came home.

[This study](http://www.feelguide.com/2013/04/29/75-years-harvard-happiness-epic-study-men-happy-life/) made me think that 'warm' would be a pretty great criteria to look for in a relationship. Not too hot, not too cold, and definitely not alternating hot-and-cold. Consistently warm and loving, even during a conflict. My friends certainly disagreed with each other sometimes, and would occasionally get frustrated with each other, but it was far from the norm and quickly resolved. Even at their worst they were never ever mean to each other. Consequently, they felt safe being open about their thoughts and feelings, positive or negative.

They simply, genuinely enjoyed living together. It blew my mind. That's what I would like to have."
I am sure that I'll mess up the delivery of this joke.
"I walked up to her and said ""we need to have intercourse immediately.""  


I wanted to use that line because if I got hit with a negative reactions I could say ""woah woah! I just meant conversation!"" Then show the definition of intercourse.  

But I didn't get a negative reaction.... I got laid. "
"Easiest choice of my entire life. We dated for a few months, I told her I loved her and she cheated on me the next day with one of her ""best friends"". She came back when he dumped her for someone else, apparently he said ""I can't trust you not to cheat"", she asked if we could get back together. I laughed at her til she hung up. "
"I've also been a best man twice and a groomsman in 3 others. 

This is a great post but I have to add one more from my own experience:

Be the glue guy. 

If shits running late, groom having doubts, nothing working to plan etc, be that guy that keeps the party calm and in order. Be Bradley Cooper in Hangover guy.

"&gt; Rookies tend to not use tongue that much because they're a bit intimidated. 

I don't necessarily agree with this. I think a lot of rookies use TOO much tongue. I don't even know the number of guys who've attempted to stick their tongue down my throat. The best kissers I've been with use minimal tongue until things really get going. Even then, the kissing gets hot and messy, but no pointy tongue or down the throat action is happening. Sometimes less is more.

I've also had guys use too much weight when kissing. What I mean is, he's on top, and he's not holding his head up. Instead, he's letting gravity push his head down, crushing my skull. I'm a very petite person, so this is a huge no no."

He points to one girl with a rather substantial chest. 

I yell across an emptying club ""HEY TITTIES!!!!""

He looked panicked, the bodyguards might have literally facepalmed.

She and 3 friends come over, rather obviously aggravated.

"Repost from myself. I feel strongly about all of this. 
Here's your mission, in order of priority.

Make sure the the groom is at the wedding on time. A. With the ring. B. Dressed appropriately. C. Sober enough (and not hung enough over) to be sociable and get through the day. D. Looking good- hair cut, shirt tucked, shaved and clean.

Run interference for groom, to keep issues from sidetracking him and then getting to the bride. A. Mother of groom is your first issue. If she's cool, awesome. If she's not- that's your problem now. Keep her mollified. Father of groom is your liaison here. B. Other groomsmen. If they're good; sweet. If they are causing trouble, kill them, hide the body, find a substitute who wears the same tux, and make sure the bride doesn't know until after the reception. C. All other logistical issues flow through you. If it is a matter of aesthetics, it goes to maid of honor, who will decide to handle it herself, deploy mother of bride, or send it to bride herself. If it is any other matter, you act as needed. Deploy groomsmen as needed. If budget is required, pay for it yourself or raise to groom as needed. Keep your car keys and wallet on you.

You are the second line of socializing. When bride and groom need space or time, you handle chatty aunts from Nebraska or loud children. You walk grandma Bertha to the punch bowl if the groom is on the other side of the reception.

Nutrition and hydration: FEED THE FUCKING BRIDE. she needs food, I promise. Healthy and clean food.

Toast. NO JOKES, NO STORIES, NOT A FUCKING WORD YOU WOULDN'T SAY DIRECTLY HIS GRANDMOTHER and be fucking brief. No one cares about you, you are a fucking grunt in the war that is getting your best friend laid on his wedding day.

Dance. Get the floor going.

Bang a bridesmaid. You gotta look out for number 1.

Edit- bachelor party: ask him what he wants. Take the brides wishes under advisement. She does have input, she does not have veto. She does get one unbreakable rule, she'll decide what it is."

"Marriage isn't for everyone. So far Ive been married for 3 years (after dating her for 7) and I can say that every one of these bullet points are spot on. We are truly happy in our marriage, and I would say it's because of a lot of those points, not in spite of them. 

It's all about what you expect marriage to be. When you both make it about the other person, you'll both have a full happy marriage and life. Make the marriage about yourself, and you'll both be miserable."

"The man in the church says our purpose is to please the creator.  
The lady in the science lab says our purpose is to find out how it all works.  
The philosopher says our purpose in life is to give life a purpose.  
Nature says our purpose is to reproduce and continue our species.

To me, the purpose is to find joy, conquer fear, live morally, make a difference in the world, help others, and then be proud and happy when it all ends and live on in the memories of my friends and family. In the long run nothing you or I do will matter though so just chill and enjoy your time.

The way I go about this? Every day in my choices I try to do things that work towards those goals. If, when I lie in bed at night and look back on what I did that day with pride, then I know I'm doing well. If not then tomorrow's a new day and I get another shot at it. "

"My girlfriend being unable to form coherent sentences for a good 5-10 minutes after we finished having sex, Her legs were also twitching uncontrollably for most of that time. Walked around feeling like Alexander the Great for several weeks afterwards.

Unfortunately those words seem to fall on deaf ears. Or she goes and buys tickets to something before I get a chance to decline and then I feel guilty about not wanting to go.
"Split the difference. Unload the morning of, so that you aren't going crazy, but your system is still interested again. Some of the gestures you make when you're horny are the romantic ones. You don't want to attend the date with a ""couldn't care less"" attitude of a guy who released recently."
Everyone says this for a reason - working out.  Can't stress enough how much better I am now that I've been working out for a few years.  Also when my apartment got robbed my Xbox was stolen.  Not buying a new one has been life changing and I'm much more productive now.
"No, we came up with it beforehand as a little joke. Didn't expect it to work at all. Somehow it did"
"I was in high school and I was hooking up with my then girlfriend in my car.  I was dropping her off after a date and we parked a little ways down the street from her house in a more secluded area.  We were going at it and this group of kids run by knocking on my windows shouting stuff, clearly they knew what was going on and were just being annoying teenagers (I probably would have done the same thing at that age).

One of the kids running by the driver-side door where we were going at it stops and presses his face against the window just to be a little shit.  He immediately recoils and freezes.  It's her younger brother.  We lock eyes, he continues backing away and bolts.  My girlfriend saw him too and was a little rattled.  We didn't end up finishing which was completely understandable in my book.

Now I mentioned this was her younger brother and at this time I was a junior in high school and he was a freshmen and we were both on the soccer team together.  Even though I could have given him plenty of shit since I sort of had the upper hand in this situation I never said anything as a cold, hard stare with a smirk was all it took for the next week or so to bring the uncomfortable image of me fucking his sister to the for front of his mind which was a satisfying enough means of payback, in my book, for cock-blocking me."
"&gt; Wild at Heart by John Etheredge

Really?! I tried to read this after someone lent it to me and I was frankly appalled at the stereotyping and macho fantasy it presented. It basically seems to argue that all men are wild adventurers and all women are damsels in distress. And anytime a man isn't allowed to be a wild adventurer or a woman doesn't feel 'rescued' enough the relationship will suffer. It basically goes completely against the second point of your OP talking about compromising. It argues that first and foremost men should be true to *themselves* (i.e. allowed and encouraged to act like stereotypical macho men from the 50's) and if they ever compromise this true self then they'll feel bad and the relationship will be bad as a result - this self-serving individualism is set up as the highest priority.

Personally I'd use this book as a good example of what **not** to do in a relationship!!

(And that's not even getting into the awful theology of it, which is probably more appropriate for a religious sub. Suffice to say I've been a Christian my whole life and it didn't present a picture of any god I've ever heard of!)"

"I used to wing-woman for a friend of mine when we went out together.

Inevitably he'd point out a girl he was into. So the go-to ""move"" was, I'd send him to the bar to get drinks for us while I went strike up conversation with the girl he was into.

He'd appear with the drinks, I'd make an excuse about not wanting to drink more, hand the girl my drink and then make an excuse to leave (toilet, ""I've just seen a friend"" etc) and leave them to it.

60℅ of the time, it worked every time."
"TSA Officer: I'm going to have to search you sir.

"Someone who can take a joke without getting offended easily. Easy to talk to and fun to be around.

They are genuine and have passion about something. It can be anything. And they gotta be smart. Dumb girls turn me the fuck off."
"I definitely prefer blow jobs.  I'm not sure why.  I like how they feel, I normally don't need a condom, and I don't have to do anything but lay back and enjoy.  It's also a cool ego boost that a girl is attracted to me so much that she'll put my penis in her mouth.  Looking down to see her sucking and looking up at me is super hot."
"I can't emphasize this enough: **Gary Chapman should be required reading.**

""Five Love Languages,"" ""Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Got Married,"" and ""When Sorry Isn't Enough"" are *incredibly* insightful, at every stage of a relationship. How do you begin a healthy relationship? What should you look for in a partner? How should you engage with your partner so as to form a lasting relationship beyond the honeymoon-phase love? What do you do when you mess up? What expectations should you consider, what red flags should you look out for?

If there's one piece of truth from Gary Chapman that *everyone* should be aware of:

&gt;**Love is not a feeling, it's a commitment.**

Love - *real* love, not the emotional high you get at the start of a relationship - is not something you do for you. It's an active choice, every day, to make another person a priority in your life."
