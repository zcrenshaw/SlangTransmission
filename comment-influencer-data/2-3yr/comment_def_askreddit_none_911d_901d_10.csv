"One that just happened to me on St. pats day. Women just thinking it's alright to touch guys for any reason. Was playing darts and had on my Michigan state hoodie which was a size too small, put on a few pounds recently. Random girl walks up to me and pulls down my undershirt and hoodie and says, your underwear is showing. Now I had assumed it was one of my friends I was at the bar with as we have a super close relationship and they would Def do something like that. Then I turn around and it's some complete stranger with her hands on my waistline. I told her to fuck right off and went on about my business.  

Now if the genders were reversed any guy would have been punched in the face and had police called. "" Your bra strap is showing"" and then is just start touching your shoulders and shirt before even finishing the sentence."
"I've def walked through Englewood.

That's a misconception people from the country have about the city right there."
