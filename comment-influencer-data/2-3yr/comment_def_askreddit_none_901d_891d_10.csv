"I literally cannot tell if I'm attractive or not, but I am def socially awkward...so there's that."
"Ahh the 80s...They look so cartoonish now, but yet it was all so serious then.

Politics:  People were in the bliss about Ronnie while he shot us into the deficit stratosphere.  There was this continuous imminent sense that WW3 would break out and result in total nuclear war.  Three very different movies cover this very well:  The Day After, Threads, and Testament.  Threads wins.

Music:  New Wave in the early 80s and hair bands in the late 80s.  The summer of '83 was a great summer for music, and I spent nearly every day at the local pool swimming and listening.  Duran Duran, Safety Dance, Electric Avenue, Every Breath You Take.  Half of the 80s classics came from that summer.  The fall would give way to Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Prince on the rise.  At the other end of the spectrum, Def Leppard would kick things off, then Van Halen, Motley Crue, ACDC and Aerosmith would make a resurgence only to be topped by Poison, Bon Jovi, and Guns N Roses.

A focus on outlandish production led many 70s class acts astray into far cheesier territory.  Clapton and Genesis come to mind first, but there are many more.  I love the Ramones, and I love the anti-Reagan sentiment of Bonzo Goes to Bitburg, but I hate that the lead-in features hand bells...

That all said, I would only come into contact with my favorite music from the 80s in the 90s:  My Bloody Valentine, The Pixies, The Cure, and the golden age of hip hop.

Movies:  Blockbusters came of age, as did sequels.  This amazing thing called a VCR meant you could watch all of this at home, and there would be lines at the local video rental shop every holiday weekend.  You definitely were meant to rent.  The first time after we bought a VCR, I recall going to the video shop and seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark on sale for $85.

In terms of actual movies, Lucas and Spielberg dominated in a time before more critical lenses got focused on both of them.  David Lynch was the indie darling who made edgier things like Blue Velvet and Wild at heart.

TV: The earliest 80s stuff truly embraced some serious redneck culture.  Believe it or not, BJ and the Bear was a TV show, not some kind of homoerotic porn.  Truckers!  Smokey and the Bandit was about driving a truck full of beer across the country while being chased by the cops.  People loved it.  The Dukes of Hazzard!  About ""good ol' boys"" driving a car around and messing with the stupid, corrupt police.  This all gave way to the A-Team, the Fall Guy, Knight Rider, Magnum PI and MacGuyver, shows that were all in one way or another based on Popeye, where the good guys beat up the bad guys.  More serious issues, like how the cocaine trade was a serious problem, got fashionably if not flippantly covered by Miami Vice, the king of mid to late 80s TV.  At much the same time, we were thoroughly entertained by the Cosby Show.  Seems a bit more sinister now and totally unfair that Lisa Bonet got kicked for making Angel Heart, a truly great 80s indie movie.

I won't touch day or evening soap operas, but they were there.

On Wheel of Fortune, you had to go shopping and spend your earnings after every round.  If you $80 left, you had to buy a dog statue or something else you really didn't want.  Some stay-at-home dad learned how to game Press Your Luck and eventually just stopped playing because he'd won enough.  One of the best resurgences of the 80s was Jeopardy!, which is still going strong and one of the most intelligent things you'll ever see on American TV.

Fashion:  In high school, my morning ritual included rolling my pants into a cuff and doing up my hair with mousse on the sides and hairspray up top.  I spent more time in the 80s primping than probably the rest of the decades that follow combined.  Girls permed their hair so that it stuck straight up at ridiculous lengths.  One girl in my high school earned the nickname ""Dynamite"" because it looked like a stick had just exploded in her face.  Did that deter her from daily having 18-inch bangs and side hair radiating out from her face?  Not at all.  She thought it was cool.

Consumerism: Along with the VCR, it was cool to have a walkman.  All music was on cassette.  Atari 2600 gave way to Commodore 64, which gave away to the NES.  Floppy disks were actually floppy, and you went to arcades to play super-advanced games for a quarter a pop.

Fun fact: the 80s hated the 70s.  So much hatred for bell bottoms and halter tops, and just this sense that it was better to be in the 80s than the 70s.  The 90s kind of disagreed with the 80s hate and embraced the 70s.
  
In a single statement:  I'm glad I was a child."
That post that is at zero and only has criticism in the comments? Def a good reason to discount the sub.
