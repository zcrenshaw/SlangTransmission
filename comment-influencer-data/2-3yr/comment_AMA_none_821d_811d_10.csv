"&gt; wildebeests and other jungle denizens

If that's how you think of women, it seems you got what you deserved."
"32 Years in Software here.  If you are in a tech centric environment, you should look.  There is no lack of jobs out there.  

This kind of bullshit means you have a boss who probably was never a software developer.  You can't squeeze more out of someone's head by working longer.  Typically, if you can get 6 hours of true productivity out of a developer, you are doing well.

Also, work/life balance.  "
"Congratulations on the weight loss, I think it's very admirable to have lost over half your body weight whilst also getting fit. 

However, having read your replies it is clear you need to work on your opinion of women. Throughout your comments you come across as a chauvinist, you ""should have pupped her"", you previously dated ""wildebeest and other jungle denizens"", you went to ""feminine classes at the gym like bodypump"". I read this and think you are stereotyping women and not respecting them at all, this is probably why women don't see you as a suitable partner. 

You are in your 30's now, these outdated opinions of women will get you literally nowhere with a woman who is around the same age. At 30 and single is this because she has been focusing on her career and becoming happy in her own life before starting a meaningful lasting relationship? If so I very much doubt the things you say will impress her in the slightest. 

In your opinion the other man your ex is with is ""weak and uneducated"" and yet your dream woman has found happiness with him. Love is not about how much education a person can have, nor how physically strong they are (again chauvinistic opinions). A person can be incredibly intelligent without the opportunity or want to carry on education. A strong man is one who makes their partner feel loved, protected and safe not a man who can ""deck"" other men for looking at her. 

I do hope that you can learn to expand your opinions of women, to see them as your equal. At this point I imagine you will be able to form a meaningful relationship. "
"So, all of the floatable plastics build up at different stages of the process.  In one eddy we get mats of condoms, in a different spot it's a mass of plastic q-tip sticks.  FYI a solo, free swimming condom is called a ""Chicago Whitefish"""
One of the toilets discharges about 10 feet away directly into a tank.  I call it a direct deposit.  
I will hunt you down 
"I feel great about it. The best way I have to describe how it feels - because I get this question a lot! - is that no, I don't feel maternal or posessive about it at all, but I do feel the same was as when I complete an artistic project that I'm really proud of. I feel great joy, pride and satisfaction, but she is *their* daughter. They are raising her (and doing a damn fine job of it!), and I helped complete their lives. She's a brilliant and talented girl, and they are the ones who get the credit for that, I just helped her get there.
"
"Most of the time, no. However they do keep very close tabs on me. And they ask me trick questions. I started being treated more unfairly when a coworker tricked me into admitting I smoke weed. Any drug is heavily frowned upon by them. I also feel like my personal information has been compromised (phone number, address, etc), because I get phone calls from people in the church daily. Always a new person, requesting some sort of task. I always decline. I am going to be very paranoid after leaving the company, because they do know where I live, and I will not be on good terms with them. They're probably scouring my social media accounts right now making sure I'm not answering questions like this."
My neighbor borrows eggs and sugar all the time.   In all these years I haven't seen even a single cupcake or brownie. 
"Well I know a small group of guys and I think they were incarcerated some time in 1972. They were a crack commando unit who were sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. 

These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem... if no one else can help... and if you can find them... maybe we can get an AMA with... The A-Team."
"No, I am 21 years old and needed a job. I lived in Clearwater, FL at the time. The entire downtown area is almost completely Scientologist owned. They're everywhere, walking around in white and blue suits. I was approached by a woman downtown who handed me a flyer and told me about a job that was hiring. It's an Aloe Vera company. Basically, they pay for me to travel around the US selling their product. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, they had assumed I was also Scientologist. Things got really weird, really fast. More questions!"
"Things got weird as soon as I started because I was working with the ""executive manager of the founding church of Scientology"" in DC. After our gig, in the hotel, she wanted to ""mind audit"" me. I had no idea what that meant, so I complied. She basically interrogated me, asking very personal questions and insisted I tell the truth. She seemed disappointed to find I was unfamiliar with the process. After returning home, a man contacted me requesting I appear in the HQ in Clearwater for ""further assistance"" with personal problems. I didn't show up, because I knew it was an attempt to recruit me. That's just the first week."
Wow. And they didn't think you'd go to the media? Dumb. They need more bad press like I need a hole in my head. 
"Yes Uber fired me for possessing pepper spray. 
I didn't use it but I did brandish it to a group of drunk frat boys that were: 1 surrounding my car and refusing to let me leave. 
2 brandished a knife. (Motioning the knife towards my tires) 
3 threw a beer bottle at my car which smashed on the back windshield. "
A tampon unfurled in the water is a Chicago jellyfish 
Sorry that you never felt useful in your life. Poor muffin.
I wasn't required to. Why the fuck would I
"Haha, Also what if I tell you I work for one of the largest tech companies in the world?"
"No, lol. But their actual beliefs are no less strange."
"Now that you're no longer an Escort, did you turn into a Ford Fusion?"
"The last relationship I was in was abusive. She destroyed my self-esteem and made sure I didn't have any friends when she left. That was 5 years ago, and I'm still not the same. How do you feel knowing that you potentially fucked up some poor guys life. How does it feel knowing that he may never be the same as he was mentally before you got to him. 

Sorry for this, it's not you. I'm glad you're working to be a better person, this is just a really touchy subject for me. "
"The rider took a video of me brandishing it and or one of his friends. I have a dash cam video not only of the bottle smashing but also the knife brandishing. I've shared this with the police for the impending investigation. They have asked me for the time being not to share it online or with anyone. 

Otherwise I would have it up on YT in minutes. 

I would also like everyone to know this isn't about getting my job back(even though I really need it right now) 
This is about Uber, it's money making motivations and lack of care or caring for its drivers. All of the day to day expenses, wear and tear, and a lot of the legal liability is left on the shoulders of essentially minimum wage earners. 

Right now in San Diego they're asking drivers to make less than $1 per mile driven(about Â¢.88) 
But they're also firing people for defending themselves. 
"
Tell us about the condom ball?
"Morgan is/was our original identity and main identity for most of our life. 

Storm is emotionally about 13 years old and is very volatile and emotional. She's our little edge lord, complete with her very cringy name. 

Zoe is emotionally in her late teens or maybe early twenties. She's creative and smart, but not very friendly. 

Caden is our other teen. He's silly and playful. He's a vegetarian, which sometimes makes life difficult for the rest of us.

Hannah is a bit of a mystery to me, but I know that she handles a lot of daily life tasks like self-care and cleaning. 

Carrie rarely fronts anymore. She was around a lot more when we were in our twenties. 

Quinn is an identity that did exist, but merged with another so he doesn't really exist anymore in the same sense. 

Hailey is one of our ""littles"". She's emotionally about 8 years old. She's scared of nearly everything but really likes watching ""grownup"" dramas that are too mature for her (Like Law &amp; Order). 

Emma is our youngest. She's emotionally about 4. She likes sugar and buying things on Amazon without permission. "
"Nature and how accessible it is. You can use your travel card to take a boat to an island or take a tram lime that terminates next to a forrest. 

And how safe it is. People here are very trusting, both in each other and in their government. It leads to better society for everyone, because people rarely scam each other or take advantage of others. "
"So wait, you didn't use the pepper spray but got fired for possessing it? "

Is it true that they finger people to check for alien plasma?
Oh shut up
Watching really dirty water come in and watching really clean water go out into the environment is fulfilling.  I look at it everyday and it makes me proud that I stepped up and took responsibility for cleaning up my corner of the world.
It's a stressful job.  Lots of responsibilities and very little authority.  I worked 96hrs in one week once.
Flushable wipes are universally reviled in my industry.  They get everywhere and clog pipes and pumps.  Use toilet paper or buy a bidet.
Actually that makes more sense. 
I'm working on it.  The guys a nut he's been collecting stuff for decades.  Lots of kids toys get flushed.  We get a dozen super balls a day.
"That's why we have guns, is to stop the violence!"
"I've worked the TARP desk so I was basically the tunnel guy.  It helps, but it isn't finished.  The McCook reservoir isn't online yet so the tunnel fills up after the first 0.25"" of rain sometimes.  

Cool fact.  The tunnel is connected to the sewer via a drop shaft.  When water drops the 300ft into the tunnel it displaces air which comes up another drop shaft.  Sometimes there is water going down that shaft and we get a poo geyser.  I've seen them get 50ft tall."
They only care about money and? 
"Why not a $50?  

There could be a whole book of stories about how guys spend the poo dollars.  The vending machine was a good one for a while but it won't take the faded bills.  Some guys used to use them for tolls.  

Everyone also has their own way of cleaning them.  I've seen bleach, borax, hairdryer, lab desiccant.  "
"I was walking in an area that a lot of people steer clear of after dark in my area.

I think he was just strung out. Apparently the police know the guy because he fires weapons in town, but this time he actually shot at someone. 

On the contrary, the car I was walking by took a round instead of me, so I'd say I lucked out.


"
"Im not an expert, but I would imagine a shitload."
"Probably when my coworker fell and hurt her knee, and later performed a ""contact"". She got down on one knee, and slowly tapped her injured knee on the floor. They think reenacting an injury will heal it.

On another occasion, I learned just how open they are about personal problems. I was alone in a rental car with one of my show managers and he was talking about his life before Scientology. He told me how his first mind audit helped him, because the auditor got rid of the guilt he carried for, and I quote, ""raiding my mother's panty drawer and ejaculating in her underwear"". Yeah. Don't think I've ever been more uncomfortable."
"I had very high expectations, as they promised a lot of money. Today is my last day on the job, which is why I decided to post this. I am quitting because they treat me unfairly and underpay me after they found out I don't belong to the church. They are basically forcing me out. If it weren't for the blatant cover-ups and loopholes in their employment contract, I could easily sue them, for a multitude of reasons."
How do you feel? Do you feel like its a part of you?  Are you curious at all?
"I like what I do.  I get to clean pollution and protect the environment.  I feel like Captain Planet when it all goes right.  

Rangers make half what I do and I have people.  "
"I'm a mom of two and I smoke weed. Of course never around them and I don't drive impaired. You're totally right about how it can help you engage with your kids. Teletubbies becomes hilarious, and your kid seeing you laugh like a fool makes them laugh. 
Wanna play Candyland for an hour straight because it's your latest obsession? Absofuckinglutely. 
A personal rainy day favorite is to put on a movie, lay on the floor and let them use my back as a canvas with markers. 
I've got terrible anxiety issues so it's nice to not feel completely wound up for a little while so I can focus on and engage with my kids instead of mindlessly playing with them while I have hundreds of other things going through my head. 

Also for what it's worth, I smoke with my parents also. I don't find it any different than having a few glasses of wine with them. "
Shh it's the best kept secret in town 
Poo dollars are very real.  They get faded after being in the sewer and it takes a keen eye to see them.  I don't touch it unless it's a $20.  Coins settle out in the sewer and we never see them.
"The bucket is below a bug zapper.  They're dead.  It just keeps them from blowing everywhere.

The larvae live in our tanks and get trapped in a filter building.  The emerge in the building by the millions.  "
"When I was a sushi chef I needed a word to describe a group of women who would order a large amount of food and tell eachother how bad they are for doing so. The word I made up was a ""flork"" the ""of cows"" part just sounded catchy as a name"
... sexually harassing women. 
When I was younger I was sexually abused by a woman who lived with us. My mother passed away before I could bring it to her attention so I never really got closure. I met them to meet them sort of to see what makes them tick. Much like a train wreck curiosity. I lied to myself that I was doing it for journalistic reasoning but no. It was deeper than that. 
"I agree, getting shot would be a real day ruiner.

Honestly, I'm not sure. The thing that surprised me most is that I didn't piss myself, but it was definitely something I don't want happening again."
"Do you work for the IRS?  

Personally I pass on poo dollars.  It may strange but I'm a germ freak and don't touch anything without gloves.  

In total under $100.  We recently updated some equipment so the poo dollars have been getting shredded.  "
"&gt;being awfully vein

Low body fat will do that to ya"
Do you make bank?
"If you are there for only a year and you already got a bad review, let me guarantee you that things won't become better. Reviews stay in your record and will always be used against you, given the chance. 

I had a similar situation to yours, but in my case, I got a bad probation review because the company's architect screwed up and tried to use me as a scapegoat. I stayed there for 7 months, and when I quit they even offered me better conditions to convince me to stay. Some places are really toxic and not worth the trouble. 

If you decide to search for another job, it's really no big deal, just tell the interviewers that your current job didn't really match your expectations (just don't go trashing your current manager/employer) and that you wish to find something more interesting/challenging/rewarding/etc.

This is my opinion on the assumption that you don't jump jobs every year.

"Years ago I went to a Dixie Chicks concert with my wife.  There were two jr highschool girls behind us.  Before the concert started I overheard them talking about how they were going to scream the whole time on purpose intending to lose (aka damage) their voices so people would think they were super cool at school the next day.

They did exactly that and absolutely destroyed the concert for me.

"I once removed a USB drive without safely ejecting it in windows. So yeh, I'd say I live life on the edge "

"Ok, Nevermind I lied. I know how much it sucks to have responsibility without authority."
"It's not that unusual for someone with DID to have several childlike alters. One theory is that these identity states tend to be somewhat frozen in the emotional state of the host at the time of their creation. Emma came into being when we were four, Hailey when we were 8, etc. 

Caden and I get along pretty well lately. It's nice to have someone so cheerful around. "
"Microbeads at my plant are likely getting caught by our sand filters.  Not enough to see them though.

The plant is a perfect breeding ground for midges etc.  Its a never ending conveyer belt of larvae.  Some go to lights, some don't.  Very few escape the building.  They either end up on the bucket or on the floor.  Occasionally they end up my nose.  "
"Odd.. Uber doesn't seem to have a [policy ](https://www.uber.com/legal/policies/firearms-prohibition-policy/en/) against the use of pepper spray. 

I found this [Uber board ](https://uberpeople.net/threads/uber-policy-vs-lyft-policy-driver-choices-for-self-defense.133321/)

It indicates that 

&gt;Uber does not object to drivers carrying whatever is legal in their locale (with the exception of guns/firearms).

It looks like pepper spray, depending on the quantity, is legal most everywhere

IMHO I'd go back to them and ask where in TOS you violated."
"I mean, I never went into a relationship with anyone thinking, ""Man I'm going to be so abusive and shitty!! It'll be great!!!"". It just... happened. I didn't even realize it was abusive behavior for quite a while. I would get insecure and jealous over boyfriends having female friends, liking girls' posts on social media, asking them to unfriend them, etc. 

My current boyfriend had girls as friends on social media and at one point, I said I was using his phone to play a game and I went through and deleted them all. He isn't really active on social media so he never noticed. That was toward the beginning of the relationship. I would go through his phone and read his messages and things. I knew it was wrong then but did it anyway. It really boils down to being immature, selfish, possessive, and insecure.

I absolutely regret it. Looking back, I'm ashamed. I don't own him. I have no right to go through his things or control who he has in his life. If he chooses to be with me, it should be because he wants to be with me, not because I've isolated him from any other options."
And money. 
"They are examples of why he's an asshole, not why you should be working longer. 

Fuck that culture, I have a 14 month old and recently went down to 4 days a week so I could spend more time with him. "
Where were you and why did this happen? Was it just bad luck and some crazy person?
Legos.
Op is asshole
"I know them now. I was matched with them through the clinic where I had signed on to do this; we communicated via email regularly during the process, and we met in person for the first time in the period where she had been implanted with the fertilized eggs, but before we knew if it had worked. 
The clinic had me do several different tests and interviews to see if I'd be a good candidate, they chose this couple for me because they were really well thought of by the clinic. They'd gone through the process with a previous donor (after a number of other different medical attempts), and that woman pulled out halfway through, having cost them a good deal of money - I believe her reason was that a new boyfriend was uncomfortable with it.

I looked into donation in a large part because of curiosity, as well as knowing some people having fertility trouble. Having had the idea, I went to an information session and liked what I heard, and thought it would be a really great thing to be a part of, and something not many people have done."
"You know what sucks? Not knowing what is the **this** in

"Yes. They do this thing called a ""contact"". One time my coworker tripped on a curb and hit her knee. When she got back to the hotel she got down on one knee and slowly tapped the knee she hurt on the floor. They think physically reenacting an injury will heal it."
How did things get weird? Did they find out that you weren't a Scientologist? 
"My heart goes out to you.  Have you ever undergone post-traumatic counseling?  I think it could really help your psychatric healthâand I don't mean to insult you or stigmatize you, bc it really is important for one to take care of, even without having gone through such a terrible ordeal."
"&gt; Sounds like you need to file a complaint with HR.

Going to HR is a sure way to get fired.  HR is not there to protect the employee, they are there to protect the company."
Only so many 21 year olds smoking weed working in scientology near Clearwater. If these people poke around as deep as I suspect then that might be enough to go on. You don't want to be considered an SP if Theroux's documentary is anything to go by. Highly reccomend you watch it if you didn't already. They're not big into this public shaming (though they deserve it). Just be careful dude/dudette and thanks for these answers. 
Hello coworker 
"Helen: The Woman With Seven Personalities

I went and watched it since it was mentioned. I have mixed feelings about it. I think that Helen does have DID, but that she and her alters are playing it up a bit in a desperate attempt to get people to believe them (I sympathize). 

My child alters do not talk in high pitched little voices. They just talk, just like a child just talks. They do sound a bit higher than I do when I talk, but not to the degree that you hear in that documentary. I think that's played up.

I also don't believe in ""Satanic Ritual Abuse"" at all. There's no evidence that any of it ever happened. I think that people who believe they are victims of SRA just can't face the fact that they were abused by normal, average, everyday people (often their own family). I think sometimes it's easier for people to believe that they were abused by a cult than to accept that Uncle Frank is a pedophile. "
"That's a huge burden that I have everyday. I've never been in a serious relationship before. My longest relationship prior to my current boyfriend was maybe 3 months, so my behavior never got to the extent with them that it did with my current boyfriend.

It is very destructive behavior, both for myself and the person I am with. I've thought about reaching out and apologizing to ex boyfriends for this before, but they were not serious relationships and I think they are better off not ever hearing from me again."
"Those mind audits are pretty intense, from what I've heard that is what convinces people that they've had an epiphany about the whole thing. Just tricky psychology."
"1: Invest loads of time into appearance

2: Find girlfriend who invests loads of time into appearance 

3: Other than appearance maintenance, still behave the same way as before

4: Other than appearance, still have the same results as before

Draw your own conclusions, but one possibility is that you could spend time investing in your personality and in finding a girlfriend who's compatible in that department as well."
Do you dream that you're going to the toilet when you wet the bed? 
Why? Are you under cover for an expose'?
Do you feel that they're watching you?
"This question is going unanswered because OP was ""the other woman"" and her BF was married with kids when they got together. It's in her post history just FYI."
"I wouldn't have either. 

I'd say, ""Is this one of those events where you try to guilt me into going or I lose my job? I'm gonna have to talk to the labor board about this. What's your full name again?"" Just to mess with them."
"lemme give you a WINDOW into our work day for myself / the coders under me.

show up whenever. usually 1030-1130. take lunch whenever for however long. usually work until 6 but if you need to be somewhere you can go, or later if you feel like it we've gone till 730/8 before. we don't do ""formal"" holidays or sick days if you need time off just let someone know and take it. if there's a crisis we expect you to pick up your phone, though in exchange we promise not to call unless it's something catastrophic that we know we can't handle. the company owners want things to be ""nice"" for everyone. we have work and we get it done, but if there's a difficult way and an easy way, they will always want us to select the easy way."

"Sounds like you work at the wrong place, time to move and let HR know the reasons on the exit interview.

"He started beating me with a paddle (2x4) when I was four. Anything and everything was punishable by paddle, including blowing my nose within ear shot of him and using the restroom in the middle of the night. Some of his pet names for me were ""bitch"" and ""cunt""... Those names started when I was six-ish. He wouldn't let me go on hormones (birth control) when I started passing out from my periods as a teenager. I was grounded for being sick or passing out on my period because I was being ""lazy."" He tried to sell me to an Amish man when I was 20. I had to give him full body rubs every night after dinner. He now like to gaslight me, by either denying anything ever happened or by telling me I'm too sensitive. "

"a. Female

b. We have various sexual orientations in the group. I saw a joke once where someone says, ""Oh that TV character is LGBT"" and the other person says, ""LGBT? What, all at once?"". So yeah, we're LGBT all at once.

c. No. Funny story, I recently started taking a mood stabilizer that had the unintended consequence of eliminating all the others and leaving me alone in complete silence. It was the worst month of my life. I'm in the process of weaning myself off that medication right now. "
"That's a good question, and there's a complicated answer. 

I am currently the ""main"" identity in that I am the one here and in control most of the time. I handle our day-to-day tasks and I have the most comprehensive memory and skill set. 

However, I am not the original identity and I haven't always been the main identity. I was sort of thrust into this position and I'm handling it as well as I can. "
"I've seen her several times, the family and I get together every couple of years. I know there's the father's DNA in there too, but DAMN, does she look so much like me at that age! It's wonderful and fascinating, and I really got a great couple to do this with. 
She's too young to know all the exact details of her conception, but they plan to tell her everything once she starts learning more about the subject. (Right now I'm just a ""family friend"" to her). Usually we go out for dinner or something like that, and last summer I went to see a play she was in, it's a great relationship."

"Lots of places expect you to break your back for their objectives. I did it as a funeral director, in the Army, as a teacher, it's everywhere. Now I chuck bags into airplanes and get told to take breaks, days off, and my supervisors like to talk about all the ways you can game the system to get paid more for taking hours on my regular days off and putting up my regular hours for other people to take. Mandatory vacation days and union protection, not too shabby. I'm not entirely sure how to get a negative eval around here, I'm not entirely sure anybody is paying attention to what I'm doing."
