there's absolutely nothing wrong with dairy. it's been negatively associated with obesity in some studies. it's just vegan/vegetarian propaganda.

"Yeah when you have to step in twice and ramp up your entire nations economy to support an enormous war effort on the other side of the world, you tend to keep a standing army to make it easier just in case it happens again. Europeans don't get it because they didn't have to fight a war on 2 fronts in WWII, nor did they have to fight an enemy that spanned entire oceans. (The British are the exception here, but even they didn't do the grunt work in the Pacific campaign- that was the US Navy and US Marine Corps that won that theater of war.)

Edit: Please note that I am not saying France, Britain, and other European countries did not ""fight as hard"" or sacrifice as much as America. I am merely pointing out the difference in post war military doctrine and how that can be traced back to the nature of WWII."

what did they even sing though? in asian they don't really have music in the same sense that we do over in america/western countries. did they all sing western songs?

"yeah. it sucks being at a show when theres a huge crowd around you that doesnt give a shit and is just standing around looking around and not paying attention to the show

it throws you off and creates shitty vibes

"That's because you're used to it. You're hungry because your body expects it. I did this weird experiment where I changed by eating habits every month and realized hungry is just your body whining.

If I got used to eating breakfast in the morning, I'd be hungry when I woke up. If I got used to eating 6 small meals a day, I'd get a little hungry 5-7 times a day. If I got used to eating one big ass meal at 4pm, I'd be starving around 3pm but fine at every other point."

"Not dogs, it's children names that get me amped up.  Like people who name their kids something stupid because ""it's an original name"".  Idk maybe it's just me but when I hear someone thinking about names for their child I think of middle school me and how torturous I'd be because of their name lmao"
"I do all that because I love Jesus, not because I want to be part of some club.  Camps helped me develop spiritually and Christian music builds up my values instead of secular music which tells me to objectify women and live selfishly."

"&gt; Put it this way: killing a person arbitrarily is wrong. You should know that by yourself, without the need of religion telling you that.

But you only know this because you grew up in a Christian nation.  If you had grown up in a Muslim nation, you might think that your sister's husband needs killing because he used to be a Christian and you just need to be sure (true story)."

"If you weigh less, guess what?.....you get to .10% quicker.

Assuming women have lower tolerance to a .10% is misogynistic. 

thousands of people don't die from .09%. I'm arguing against policing that. MADD forced .08 on all the states. as a feel-good legislation that does nothing to make the roads safer.

It's  the people that are driving at .15 and above. That is already illegal. 

I know you want to call names and grand stand, but keep it on topic skip. We are talking about how MADD is Bullshit. Not on the evils of TRUE impaired driving."

"Maybe I'm getting too old, but drinking so much that you are blacking out is definitely a problem, particularly if it is a reoccurring thing. 

A drink very 15 minutes (which is more than 3 in an hour) is also rather crazy. The human body can process approximately 1 drink an hour, so pacing yourself at 4 times that limit is outright dangerous.

I'm not saying that doing either of those things once or twice in your life makes you an alcoholic, but neither of those things should be seen as ""normal"". At the very least you are irresponsibly drinking and at the worst you might actually have a legitimate problem that would be worthy of addressing.

Disclaimer: Light Beer doesn't count as a drink, but if you enjoy light beer, I suggest you seek help anyway."

"It seems incredible that a desire to be beautiful is actually indicative of a female brain? Is that a defining characteristic? I have a hard time fathoming why anyone would want to be male when it is entirely true that male emotions and well-being literally is sacrificed so that females can be girly, silly, carefree, and happy in society.

Why would you want to be part of the miserable slave class instead of the happy, beautiful, serviced class?"

"Oh shit, i didnt clarify who the said ""people"" were in the first citation you made. I didn't mean that calling disabled people names doesn't hurt their feelings. By ""people,"" I meant those who are doing dumb things and being called names, not the people who aren't at fault for the fact that they are actually disabled."
"Well a) It's not said that these companies are any better and b) if Monsanto makes the best genetically modified crops and no one else is allowed to due to their patent, their size doesn't matter. These farmers have to be able to compete and obviously want to use the most efficient way to produce their crop. The fact that they do use Monsanto's products and the fact that they work, does not mean that Monsanto is a benevolent company. Success does not legitimize."

"Someone suggested F3- it's the worst have of the series. It fails as an RPG, it fails horrendously as a shooter, and its world building consists of vaguely fallout sounding buzzwords cobbled together in order to somewhat-resemble a fallout universe.

If you want a modern game, go straight for NV. For a good story, incredibly nuanced world (by any standards) and a game where your actions have consequences, play the first two (first one is short enough, and replayability is incredible for that game, so doing it multiple times is highly recommended), then NV. 

F3 is a steaming pile of shit that makes no sense, is sparsely populated by sentient-yet-mentally-retarded blow-up sex dolls, and is plagued by gameplay and game design issues to such an extent that *fans* had to modify the bejesus out of the vanilla game to make it *objectively* less terrible. Play NV instead. You won't miss any of the ""lore"" by skipping the dumpster fire that is F3."

"maybe he said that because clean water IS NOT a right, someone must clean it for you, and if you do not pay personally, someone else does it for you. It is ok if you want other people to work for you for free but this is not sustainable. This does not mean that Nestle should have a monopoly over water, but clean water is costly and something that costs must be paid by someone, and something that must be paid by someone, cannot be a right, in any case it can be a benefit, but not a right.

"Jesus Christ, Nirvana was the most important band of the 90s and had only three members, you could at least know their names.

As for the content of your prior comment, it's obtuse. I love(d) Nirvana, and I totally want that shirt because it's fucking hilarious. And Kurt would have found it funny as well, going by what he used to wear."
"That doesn't make any sense. Just because something happened before, doesn't mean it will happen again, neither does it mean that everything that can't be diagnosed, but has a minority self diagnosing, is in fact diagnosable. By that logic homeopathy works, because some people report it works. 

Of course you couldn't be diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 1700's. People believed that everyone with a retardation was possessed by demons.
We are not nearly as primitive now (Although I do realise that civilizations in the future might look different at that). 

Now, that nautilus article. (It is not a study, mind you) . 

Mukherjee comes to the conclusion that if you inject a gene into mice, they don't act as their sex typically does. I don't get what you are trying to say. 

How does that in any way mean that there is a gender spectrum? It means that injected male mice don't act exactly as regular male mice, presumably because you are altering their genes, so some biological functions that males have may not have full effect on them, but some female ones have more of an impact, and vice versa.

Does that mean the mouse has a new gender? No, it doesn't. It is exactly my argument, if you are not 100% male/female, you do not have a new gender."
