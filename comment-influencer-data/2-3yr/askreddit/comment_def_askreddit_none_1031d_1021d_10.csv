"I had this happen once quite by accident. It was in 1987 and i was hanging out with a friend at her place. We were listening to the radio and the DJ came on saying he had tickets to a concert. I called and damned if i didnt win. The concert was the next weekend, they said they were doing a remote out of the hard rock cafe that day and that i could come get the tickets there.

Ok, cool, we'll get the tickets, grab lunch and then kill some time till the concert starts. We head down there at the appointed time, go in tell them why we are there and they lead us off to a side dining room and sit us down. They say we get lunch too and hand us a menu. As we are ordering other people come and sit down at the table with us. They look like typical '80's headbangers, then i relize they have british accents. I do a doubletake and think, damn, that guy looks like Joe Elliott, i glance around the table and seeing Rick Allen, confirmed it, I'm sitting at a table with fucking Def Leppard.

They were pleasant, although really, really tired, maybe hungover. They didnt act aloof or like they were being taxed by doing it and were actively conversing with a couple of starstruck teenagers. Overall, it was pretty cool. They gave us Vinyl albums and autographed them, gave us shirts and all sorts of other stuff. Definitely a good  memory.

Overall, it was a great experience. "
I was fucking waiting for it to be Def Leppard and I'm so glad it actually was. 10/10
"Not at all. My agency made me recommend other discipline methods, but as long as marks aren't left and an open hand is used (as opposed to a fist or another object) that's def within a parents rights. 

But people get so nervous when I come (understandably) they lie to try and seem like perfect parents. "
