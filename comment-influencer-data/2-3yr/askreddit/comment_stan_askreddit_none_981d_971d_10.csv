"Alexander Hamilton  
Alexander Hamilton  
Got yourself a problem  
He can Alexander handle it  

Lost 150 pounds  
Alexander damn he thin  
Never lost a single fight  
Alexander champion  
Has a love for weird guitars  
Alexander mandolin  
Wishin' he could go to sleep  
Alexander Ambien
Lives in a department store  
Alexander mannequin  
Breath is smellin' kinda' whack  
Alexander hand ya mints  
Sees something he doesn't like?  
He Alexander banning it  
Loves The Office way too much  
Alexander Pam and Jim  
  
Alexander Hamilton  
Alexander Hamilton  
Recently became a saint  
Alexander hasn't sinned  
  
Favorite Sith Lord in the world  
Alexander Anakin  
Has a very lovely smile  
Alexander handsome grin  
Transitioned to a woman, now he  
Alexander man again  
Knows two songs by Eminem  
Alexander Stan and Kim  
Totally skipped lunch, I want an  
Alexander sandwich  
What you want on your footlong?  
Alexander ham and swiss  
Yo, he'd make a good president  
Alexander candidate  
Really need some liquor now  
Alexander hand me gin  
Doesn't get enough sunlight  
Alexander tanning bed  
This costume cost a jillion dollars  
Alexander damn he rich  
Used to watch the old school Jack  
Alexander Handypen  
Elton John's his favorite artist  
Alexander Candle Wind  
  
Yo, I dedicate this song to Alexander Hamilton, the greatest   president in the wooorrld"
