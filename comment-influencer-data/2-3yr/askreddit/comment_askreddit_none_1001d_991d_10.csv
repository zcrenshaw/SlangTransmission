"I have a friend who caught her son looking at hentai. He wasn't wacking it, just had a boner you could see from his boxers. She asked me for help on what to do. I said I don't know? As long as it's girls he's looking at I guess it's ok"

"In fairness, if you're at a *school* facility, the team belonging to that school kinda *do* own the place, even if it's open to everyone. 

Just like the drama kids *do* own the multipurpose rooms and the Comp Sci kids *do* own the best computer labs, despite them being ""open"" to everyone. "
"HR exists to solve problems you CAN'T solve yourself. For example, if a coworker is making you feel unsafe and you think you're in a danger, such as in the case of sexual harassment or verbal threats. Or if someone abuses their position by telling you to do something you're not legally required to do, like working off the clock.

You're right, words have consequences. And the consequences for saying something which offends people is that those people aren't going to like you, and you're going to have a hard time making friends. 

If I get annoyed that a coworker keeps asking where I'm from because he thinks I don't ""look American"", I'm not going to invite him to hang with me outside work, because I'm not going to interact with someone I find annoying when I don't have to. If I involve HR in this, I'm the problem for creating unnecessary drama in the workplace, and making everyone afraid of opening their mouth lest they inadvertently say something that will offend someone and cost them their job. Frankly, the person reporting it should be the one given a warning, and fired if they insist. 

Growing up means understanding you'll have to work with people you don't like, who say things you find insulting. Being unable to handle that apparently means you still get to be president, but it also means you're seriously immature. "
LOL  the office . How original

Why do you think there's that red line in word when you type?
Republicans hate it when you say that :)

"Right, sure, there's always some excuse for you to hide behind (we just somehow report it at vastly higher rates than any other Western nation, really! It's not the hordes of unassimilated middle eastern and african men that we've handed over entire portions of our cities to! It's just our incredibly high rates of reporting!)

Nice try Sven. Where do you work as an MD, exactly? Malmo? I doubt it."

There are plenty of AskReddit questions that are boring and uninteresting. This one stands out because of how frequently people with little or no experience ask it.

"I'm saying they measure they're masculinity by it, so yes they put a lot of value into it, which is why one of the worst insults to a man is, on their mind, saying they have a small penis.

Going by the comments made by men in the thread, that is not to say all of them do it."

If you haven't figured out what childhood is, how could you possibly have figured out adulthood?

I get that you're pissed off that I've pointed out the failing in your development.  But you being pissed off, as an adult, just confirms what I've said."

I know it is a fairly conservative position but fat shaming definitely works, not for all people, but definitely for some.

edit: the video is a clip from a 2 hour lecture from Milo on fat shaming, I'll link it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBSqCEwAliI

edit 2: I seemed to have triggered some liberals. Good, I like liberal tears :D"
How we aren't allowed to have a subreddit for our president elect.
"&gt;Those people aren't wrong about what they like.

I don't know what that sentence is really supposed to mean, that doesn't have anything to do with people's hate for her. They're not saying ""Her viewers are wrong for liking her!"" they're saying they think she's an unfunny, hypocritical, uglier version of Miss Piggy. I've seen plenty of hate for her but I've never seen anybody say somebody is ""wrong for liking her"". "
"&gt; It isn't asktrumpsupporters.

Have you actually visited the subreddit or are you just discounting the counterargument since you can't be bothered to back up your claim?

It's literally there for you to ask questions. Of course, we ask you do it in good faith

&gt; I'm not aware of any trump subreddit that allows any amount of dissent at all and isn't just screaming and memes.

You've posted this *right after the sentence saying ""It isn't asktrumpsupporters"", which further tells me you've either never visited that subreddit or you're talking out your ass.

&gt; What's the deal with it being the biggest safespace on reddit where people can go to be angry about safespaces? I get that it is memes and ""shitposting,"" but many of those people are totally serious. They believe all this stuff...so that doesn't make any fucking sense. 

It's just a safespace to circlejerk Trump and claim everywhere else is a safe-space for non-Trump supporters. And that's mostly a true statement - you go to discuss him anywhere on Reddit and you're almost always going to be met with hostile discussion instead of actual discussion. 

&gt; How is that not a red flag to you?

Well, considering the fact you're basing this question off of is inherently not true, I actually don't have an answer to this because I don't even think that such a red flag exists - there is a place for dissent, it's r/asktrumpsupporters. If you're just going there with a smug, ""HAH, I can stump them with THIS one!"" and refuting all their responses by just saying the comments are wrong, then you're definitely not there in good faith and your post will be removed. It's a pretty simple guideline - you want us to answer a question? Ask us nicely and genuinely."
How hard did you throw him against the wall?
