"As someone who worked at McDonald's for years, I encourage people to put their change in the little donation boxes for Ronald McDonald House.  They claim when you buy a Happy Meal or Mighty Kid's Meal that ""a portion"" of the sale goes to RMcD House, but I've looked and the portion that goes is *a penny* for each one sold.  If they sell 100 Happy Meals a day, that's $1 that goes to those things.  It's fucking stupid.  So donate your change, it really helps people."

She feels she's owed a child but her boyfriend (not even husband!) isn't interested. I'd love to see a man explain to the judge that he was doing some kind of honorable service by impregnating a cheating girlfriend and expected to get off scot free. On top of that, if OP here thinks in the next 18 years she won't decide to dip into his wallet, he's deluded and extremely gullible. And, finally, even if she's a complete saint who's financially stable and totally immune to greed, the moment they end up in court the judge will be the one making the decisions.  
  
When her boyfriend leaves her because she miraculously got pregnant and expects him to raise some other dude's kid, she's DEFINITELY going to come a-knockin'. And every single day that the court notice hasn't shown up in your mail might be the day before it does."

I've been in administration for a handful of years now.  Striking inverse correlation between the number of disciplinary referrals a teacher writes each year and the quality of their teaching.  This is to say, it all starts with classroom management.  If you don't manage your classroom, you will have a bad time. It will drain you, damage your credibility, and prevent students from learning.  

Secondly, (this is advice from a college with a couple decades in administration)--kids are like hogs.  They love rolling around in the mud.  The mud is their home.  And they will be happy to drag you around with them if you let them.  Stay clean.

It makes you smell like fresh-baked sugar cookies, leaves your skin feeling as smooth as satin bedsheets, and it manages to offer both a healthy clean and an invigorating sense of empowerment. 

I don't even know what that *means* and I still agree with it! 

Anyway... my girlfriend was a bit confused about how she had apparently been going through much of the stuff. When I finally confessed, she went out and bought me my *very own* tub of it. Now I use it whenever I want to have that extra special clean feeling.

But this time she had an episode where she didn't wash herself and hid herself behind her long hair all the time, not speaking to anybody.

"No, it is pretty true that humans have a default sex. What actually determines whether your body becomes male or female is whether or not there is a testosterone cascade during development. There are women out there who physically look exactly like a woman, with a Uterus and everything, but actually have XY chromosomes because for some reason that cascade of male hormones never happened. As well, before the hormone cascade, everything looks like it will be female."

Also, we're volunteers and dealing with a foreclosure and forced sale is a lot of time and energy.  Finally, one home is worth a lot more than our annual budget.

"""Everything will get better.""

As someone who's struggled with generalised anxiety and depression since I was a child I've wasted so many years waiting for everything to get better or for my life to be okay. I was waiting for this moment of brightness where 'better' would be delivered.

I've come to the realisation that no amount of talking, waiting or hiding will change your life. Action changes your life. It isn't about moving mountains but about making the effort to skim pebbles. 

Write detailed lists of small goals, 'go to bed before 11pm', 'say yes to the next outing with friends', 'save $50- this month' and commit yourself to achieving them. Take joy in ticking them off your list, find an app that shows this process. Don't berate yourself if you don't achieve some, that happens to everyone but commit to taking responsibility and action in your life. It's not hard to do small things like a load of laundry or washing the cats water bowl. 

If you tick one thing off your list a day and that's all you can manage be proud you did it. The pride you will build is surprising. Ignore other people around you. All that matters is what you do for yourself to heal your perception of yourself. 

It took me until this year after I turned 29 to realise this. I wish someone had given me this gentle advice earlier, hearing people talk about ""You've just got to get up and do it / You need to come up with a plan"" was terrifying in its vast scope so I hope this helps someone who is feeling the same way I felt. Good luck x"

It helps that I always have cash, industry myself. But here's another thought. If you want to test your man, or lady friend, pickup the tab and suggest they cover the tip. They got the meal for free so shelling out a few bucks shouldn't be that big a deal, plus you can see how much (%) they leave which is a good judge of character, as well as it helps eliminate some of the implied obligation since both parties spent money.

"I used to work at a golf course. Where to begin... I crashed into the tractor with a golf cart put a huge hole in the front fender. Tractor was fine though.

 I thought it would be funny to throw a cooler on the gas peddle and aim a golf cart at my buddy. The steering wheel turned and ran straight into the brand new fence. Warped the pole and broke the hinge. 

Every time it rained I would power slide **EVERYWHERE** 

They had a party and sold draft beer. I took the keg home to finish it and lost the keg. 

Much much more. 

But my most expensive had to be the night I got drunk while partying there and drove home and drove across the golf course (driving around 110mph) to get there. I ran over the greens (very expensive grass) and almost made it out but then I hit a sand bottle holder (a wooden stand made to hold fresh divit sand.) I panicked and ran into the ball washer (metal pole cemented into the ground.) And over a metal trashcan. It's not the most expensive here but for an 18 year old that had to pay out of pocket it was not pretty. I owed my boss $800 and I did $4,000 to my car, and my boss took it easy on me. 

I worked there for 5 years and never got fired!"

I was in a tree, completely naked and in my drunken stupor I had stripped off everything, climbed the tree, made a bed in the branches, and passed out. I climb down and realize that it's roughly dawn (around 7am) so I rush across the quad to where my room is and start whisper shouting my roommate's name, tossing rocks at the window, anything to get him up before someone sees me streaking and finds out I was drinking (dry campus with so many rules against alcohol). He sticks his head out the window, sees my white ass and lets me in through the back stairs where we find all of my clothes. I never touched tequila again"

"The dialogue in Tarantino films does. The foot massage bit brings in Marcellus Wallace, and shows he's not someone to be fucked with. Resoviour dogs sets out the characters really well at the start, and hints at the ending too. All through talking about tips. 

Dialogue is a conversation, and in natural conversation humans tend to babble. Tarantino has a knack of storytelling through this babble. If he made it so Vincent said ""So this Wallace guy. Really not to be fucked with"" straight off, it wouldn't make sense, as both characters know that. They wouldn't talk about that. Instead they talk about burgers, and foot massages. "

"I was waiting in the hospital for my husband, it is 5 am on Bank Holiday Monday, he has another infection and the hospital are keeping him in. I am just waiting for the doctor to allow me to see him before I go home. 

Sitting oposite me is this lady, who aparently has come to the wrong hospital to see her friend. However the bus for the hospital she needs doesn't run on Bank Holidays, and she doesn't have enough money for a taxi or have a car. 

She was clearly distressed, I have in my purse £20, which won't get her to the hospital but will get her fairly close. So I gave it to her. I know she was probably scamming me, but I thought even if she is she might need that money. I gave her my address, but I have not heard from her. I did not really expect to. 

That £20 was the fare for my taxi home, I walked it, took me 3 hours because I am disabled but who knows just maybe she really needed that money."

"I had some friends who got my dog shitfaced on Heaven Hill Vodka. 

We were having a bonfire party in my woods and I had made a trip to the house to get the last bit of supplies, leaving my 2 friends with my dog Ziggy, a miniature Sheltie Collie. *""Ya'll don't start drinking without me!""* I said. A few moments later, I arrive back and my friends, with shit-eating grins, ask, *""Notice anything different, Reggie?""*  I immediately noticed a portion of the half-gallon was missing. *""You assholes drank without me!""* I said with confidence. 
*""Nooo, we didn't drink any, we swear,""* while giggling like schoolgirls, *""see anything... different?""* 
Confused, I stood with my hands on my hips and looked around. Right on fucking queue, Ziggy staggers out of my peripherals and literally leans against my leg. *""Hee hee we got Ziggy plastered hurr hurr""* An are-you-kidding-me look sets across my face as my dog walks away with his ass out-running his front.

My poor dog, 35lbs at most, was fed about 5 shots of vodka from a water bottle. I was furious. We all babysat Ziggy that night; he acted exactly as a drunk human would act, except doggy. The friends who pulled this bullshit actually laid down with Ziggy, talking calmly in his ear as he lay scared. One of them cried while whispering into his ear. We all survived that night, but my two friends got checkmarks on my shit list for giving my dog alcohol poisoning. 
R.I.P., best friend. I'm glad you passed from age instead of Heaven Hill Vodka."
"We all have had those friends/classmates who are overweight and their parents don't seem to be doing anything about it, but this is even weirder to me. I was really close with a girl in my early teens who told me a few times that both her older sister and her mother (extremely petite women, both of them) kept telling her that she needed to lose weight. She was 13 or 14 at the time and quite slender. Strange even without the arranged marriage thing.

Riiiight okay bro. He then proceeded to break out a bag a coke and offer me a bump, which I may or may not have accepted :3.  He had on an Apple Watch and remarked how he liked watching his heart rate go up when doing a line.  Girl came back out and I took them to his place. 2.7x surge for that trip so I made over $30.

"I was driving home from picking up some dinner and was getting tailgated pretty hard by some guy in a King Ranch F-350 (this stereotype exists for a reason, people). Honking at me, doing that shit where he drops back a bit and speeds up to get right on my tail again... several times. Whatever, I'm already going like 31-32ish in this 25 zone, I'm not getting a speeding ticket because you're impatient. Anyway, I can tell this guy is getting super ragey right around the time a fire truck with sirens blazing and 3 cops behind him rounds the corner. I flash my lights to signal the guy tailgating me and begin to brake to pull over to the side of the road and let the fire truck pass and sure as shit this fucker steps on it and blows past me flipping me off and honking. The fire truck had to swerve to avoid hitting him head on, and one of the cops that was following it immediately flipped a bitch and gave him the party lights.

It was the most glorious instant karma I will ever witness in my life. In my city, that's a $250 fine minimum just for obstructing the fire trick, and that's assuming the cop didn't also nail him for speeding. I'd bet his overall cost was close to $500 for that little stunt. Serves the fucker right."

However, there are plenty of (mostly old) people who would look at Senator Strawman as condoning ""that type of behavior"" and would factor that into their next vote."

"&gt; I wonder how such a tradition even developed.

It follows from a couple of understandings. First that the marriage isn't valid until consummated, and second that marriage is a public social construct which requires public witnesses. So, you need public witnesses to the consummation. This is done in various ways depending on the society, but is very widespread. One common one not mentioned is the hanging of the bloody sheet outside the bridal chamber. There may even be a large crowd waiting outside to cheer and hit pans or otherwise make a lot of noise before leaving for the evening. They are not cheering to be lurid but rather to celebrate that the marriage is now official, the earlier ceremony was only the first part."

"This is a terrible pile of disinformation.
The elites in this country don't ignore the less well off because of the EU, they do it because of the British class system and because the laws set up by successive UK governments permit them to. The EU invests millions to try to build up disadvantaged areas that the government dont care about. 

Free movement takes place in actual countries like the US and it works fine plus the EU economy is the fastest growing in the world, thanks in part to labour moving to meet demand. There is no evidence for this competition between migrants and locals at all. They have no impact on school places and the NHS is bogged down with elderly brits, obese brits and smokers, not migrants. 

You are also vastly overestimating the influence of lobbyists and for a country with 800 unelected Lords and a queen (and royal family) who costs more than your PM too, I dont really understand this sudden concern for democracy. At least the EU uses proportional representation. Also pollution, seriously? London is the most polluted place in Europe and the only legislation aimed at bringing the levels down comes from the EU. 

Finally, there is no British constitution. Most of the acts of parliament, which make up the unwritten equivalent to a constitution, are based on EU law which was largely written by the UK in the 70s, so it's already UK law. Poorer households will be hit first in the recession and by the fall in sterling, which damages purchasing power. The only people who won't be badly affected are the wealthy. The labour party are in tatters and are not going to save the day. This is a disaster for the UK."

People take libraries for granted because they talk to a reference librarian once a semester and think that's it.

"Yeah, that's true, definitely. For long term effects, I'd say that the Gracchi really got the ball rolling. Then the senate and the senatus consultum ultimum became all the more common, along with violence in politics. Marius's reforms and allowing for the army to be made from the proletariat, and the generals being responsible for payment played an enormous role there after. 

Sulla just fucked Rome up. He basically left every Roman scarred and nervous about appointing another dictator after him. Sulla's reforms didn't last all that long though. Pompey and others undid many of them less than a decade later if I recall.

Short term, I'd say the First Triumvirate and then the conflict around Caesar and Pompey which prompted the civil war, which then led to the republic becoming an empire. That's what I was referring to in my comment above."

"I've told this story in the past, and I actually alluded to it in the one above. It occurred at around the same time that I tried my hand at bathroom attending, while I was doing the aforementioned novel research. I wanted to come up with my own take on ""the pigeon drop,"" which led to the creation of what I called ""The Ten-Dollar Coin Con.""

Preparing for the scam was monumentally simple: All I had to do was buy a cheap brass coin (for the cost of a dollar) from a vending machine in San Francisco's Chinatown. These coins featured the Golden Gate Bridge on one face, a trolley car on the other, and a stark absence of the words ""not legal tender."" Once the coin was in my possession, I approached one of the area's many tourists - easily recognizable as being the only people taking pictures of the junk shops - and feigned a state of hurried impatience.

""Excuse me,"" I said, ""do you have change for a ten?"" I held out the brass coin.

The woman glanced down at the metal disc. ""What's that?"" she asked.

""It's a ten-dollar coin!"" I snapped, rolling my eyes. ""What does it *look* like?"" I paused for *just* long enough to make it seem like I had reconsidered my words, then quickly adopted a calmer tone. ""Oh, wait, I'm sorry... you're not from around here, are you?""

""Oh, well, no,"" replied the woman.

""I'm really sorry,"" I said again. ""That was rude of me. I'll find someone else."" I started to walk away... but as I had hoped to be, I was called back.

""Wait, hold on a second,"" the woman said. ""What *is* that?""

""Well, like I said,"" I answered, holding out the piece of brass junk, ""it's a ten-dollar coin. I need to catch the bus, so I was trying to find change.""

A few moments later, I had successfully exchanged the coin - which, again, I'd purchased for a dollar - for ten times its value. I probably *would have* felt guilty about that, too, except that once I'd completed my con, I confessed to the whole thing and returned the woman's money. I even told her that she could keep the brass coin as a memento. She was flabbergasted at first, then amused once I explained the purpose behind the exercise... so much so, in fact, that she wanted me to run the scam again on her husband.

**TL;DR: The San Franciscan Ten-Dollar Coin Con.**"

"That's not really a mystery. There are tons of people who died or went missing where it is a mystery and people don't know. Elisa Lam is not one of those cases yet constantly is brought up on Reddit for some reason. 

The surveillance footage of her getting in the elevator suggests that she was having a manic episode. A fact is that she had bipolar, apparently she wasn't taking her medication at that time, I don't know if that part is true but if it is it further points towards a manic episode. Even if she was taking medicine it is still of course entirely possible that her illness was affecting her. The footage suggest she was running from someone or something, she ran into the elevator and was pushing multiple buttons in a panicked way wanting it to hurry up. There is no evidence from this surveillance footage that she was being chased by an actual person but if you put two and two together she probably thought her life was in danger because of her state of mind. She 'escaped' onto the rooftop and hid in the water tank because people having a manic episode don't make the best decisions. Unfortunately she couldn't reopen the water tank and died. She was also found naked but her clothes were in the tank with her, she probably took them off to swim better or maybe there isn't a logical reason because her state of mind wasn't being logical. We don't know whether she opened it herself and then once inside couldn't open it again, it was already open and she went inside and closed it, or she opened it, left it open and somebody else closed it without looking inside. In all likelihood I would imagine that she opened it and then closed it(or it fell shut) and then was unable to open it again from the inside. There is also the possibility that she drowned very quickly before even attempting to open it again. What we do probably know is that she ran onto the roof and went inside the water tank and drowned. 

Edit: The police or the coroner don't find it a mystery, they believe it was accidental drowning with her bipolar disorder playing a part in it."
"That's actually declassified info now

Basically we were sending microphones high into the atmosphere where radio waves can travel further to try and spy on communications across the world.  This was during the Cold War.

"A friend of me started to wank on a Chatroulette-like website with a girl. But it was a fake girl with a software and the guy recorded everything and ask for 3000€ to erase the video, this guy has all the important informations about my friend (adress, name, fb profile etc..) and of course my friend couldn't pay 3000€. So this scammer published and sent the video to hundred of people from his friends list and everyone in high school saw the video and knew the story, everyone was laughting at him. The saddest thing is that teachers learned what happened too and most of them saw the video too, they was laughting at him instead of trying to help him. Finally, this guy moved to an other School after he tried to get suicide. A lot of students has been punished but not even only one teacher had a problem because of this story. This is probably the most unfair case that I know in my entire life. ( sorry if I've made some mistakes I'm not a native english speaker)

"&gt; Different definitions of clean. 

OMG, such a struggle in my current relationship. We have different definitions too.  
 

These are just my very general and simple guesses, since I don't (didn't) know either of you. You're cleaning up for common everyday life. She's cleaning up for overall presentability. I think it's important to recognize these differences, and also that there's something more behind how and why you both clean as you do. 



Your hands are prunes but the dishes are clean and the stove is cleaned - the mundane tasks are done, which is what you want as a result of cleaning. Finish up the necessities every day, so you can relax and go about the rest of your evening without concern or bother about those things. She's tidied up the home in case friends or family drop by - the outside image is done. She wants to make sure people see you and her in a ""put together"" sort of way, and having the home look like an ad in a retail magazine is what that is for her. Her hands aren't prunes, but her back hurts from hunching over the laundry, and she hasn't taken any personal time to chill because the little things added up throughout the entire day.   



Neither of you may be able to change or influence one another's views, but it actually sounds like you two had a somewhat decent tradeoff. You took care of the two of you personally, she took care of the presentation of the two of you to everyone else. You had her back with the practical, she had your back with the superficial. The reasons each of you needed to express your cleanliness may differ, but together, you accomplished all aspects of it. You both had the home you wanted and needed.    



If only she would just soak the dish from Tuesday's lunch though... I getcha. *Please. Just run some water into the bowl for half a second, I don't care if you leave it for 2 days after that. PLEASE, just flip the fucking handle that's two inches from your hand when you set down the bowl.* But she may also have been thinking, *Please. Just pull the blankets up from the foot of the bed, that's all I want. PLEASE, they don't even have to be tight, I'll do that, just don't toss them to the floor without a fucking care.*  

You can each do small things to help the other with their needs, without giving up who you are. That's where ""compromise"" in a relationship comes into play. "

"It's okay, don't take it personally. Most of Reddit has zero clue what management, especially any of the C-whatever-O jobs actually do or why they're paid the money they are."
"It's a huge issue to still be able to spot those things as an adult. The social contract results in most people never being too aware of any persons actual feelings, being that they're usually hidden behind a facade of niceties. 

People love to say that they appreciate bluntness, or when someone notices how they actually feel, but the truth is that they really only appreciate it now and then. When someone is constantly noticing that they're lying and calling them on it, they get tired of it really quick. This results in a conundrum.

Since you can easily spot out people who are faking how they feel about you or whatever, you have to decide what to do with that knowledge. A lot of people will continue to deny their feelings if you confront them, and then avoid you. So you can sit on the information, but then you know they're being disingenuous. Which can make it hard for you to believe any interaction with them.

It's not really a good thing. As they say, ignorance is bliss."

"I have a friend who is a big Hillary supporter. But he focuses on ripping Bernie Sanders, and sometimes the allegations are just completely crazy.

Now, no matter how you slant, the idea that Bernie Sanders is a master financial criminal of the highest order is just a bizarre conclusion to come to, IMO. "

"I've found two for me with both involving strangers seeing my penis. 

One time I was using the sauna at the gym. There was a guy in there chatting me up who seemed friendly and harmless. It was nice to have some casual conversation for once instead of sitting around naked together in silence. A few days later he posted the ad for me. He mentioned my name, the neighborhood I live in, where I work, and then an uncomfortably thorough physical description of me. That description included details of my penis and body hair pattern.

I wrote back and politely asked him to take it down because I didn't want anyone I know reading that about me. In fact the only reason I even saw it in the first place was because a friend read it and thought the description sounded like me. He obliged, we had some awkward ""Soo... what's up?"" exchanges and that was about it.

Another time I got drunk with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and we decided to go wander around a park and catch up. Eventually I had to pee and seeing as how it was 1 AM in an empty park with locked bathrooms I just whipped it out and started going in a bush. That's when some dude emerged from the darkness down the sidewalk, stood next to me, and started watching me. 

**Me:** [peeing]

**Him:** Hey.

**Me:** ... hi. 

**Him:** Pissin'?

**Me:** Yeah.

**Him:** Nice.


He watched me pee for a few more seconds then casually walked away. The next day he made an ad for the guy pissing in the park. Originally I had no intention of writing back but the next night I went out drinking once again and got curious about what he wanted so I responded to it. He seemed pretty weird (no surprise there) so our exchange only lasted about two e-mails before I backed out. "

"Actually genetics do have a large role in obesity, but it is (mostly) to do with appetite regulation, not the metabolism. The way that a person responds to an environment where high-energy junk foods are everywhere is hugely affected by genetics, the way their body processes the food not so much.

[This is recognised and acknowledged in science:](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521690X01901538)

&gt; Obesity is a multifactorial condition. Environmental risk factors related to a sedentary life-style and unlimited access to food apply constant pressure in subjects with a genetic predisposition to gain weight**. The fact that genetic defects can result in human obesity has been unequivocally established over the past 3 years with the identification of the genetic defects responsible for different monogenic forms of human obesity: the leptin, leptin receptor, pro-opiomelanocortin, pro-hormone convertase-1 and melanocortin-4 receptor genes.** The common forms of obesity are, however, polygenic. The examination of specific genes for involvement in the susceptibility to common obesity has not yet yielded convincing results. Approaches involving the candidate genes and the positional cloning of major obesity-linked regions (state-of-the-art future prospects) will be discussed.

[Another paper:](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/er.2006-0040)

&gt; CHANGES IN DIET and physical activity have driven the rise in the prevalence of adult and childhood obesity over a relatively short time interval (1, 2). However, it is important to recognize the significant contribution of hereditary influences on weight, especially at a time when we are beginning to develop an understanding of the molecules involved in the control of energy homeostasis and how genetic variation within them can influence human obesity (3, 4). The genetic contribution to body weight has been established through family studies, investigations of parent-offspring relationships, and the study of twins and adopted children (5, 6). These studies consistently report heritability estimates of 40–70% (3). Thus, weight is a highly heritable trait, with a heritability that is only slightly less than that for height (7, 8). **As is the case for height, where nutritional changes in the last 50 yr have contributed to substantial increases in mean final height in many populations, environmentally driven changes in body weight in the population occur against a background of susceptibility to weight gain that is determined by genetic factors.**

[People with one particular genetic variation are 22% more likely to be obese.](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n6/full/ng2048.html)

None of this implies obese people are doomed to obesity, or that genetics is the only thing responsible. But the scientific community has found and recognised a genetic component which shouldn't be ignored when trying to find solutions for obesity.

"&gt;Look at the board of any Homeowners' or Townhome Association...

I took my strata to court one year and it ended hilariously bad for the strata / owners committee.

My inital issue was simple, a common wall was leaking and needed to be fixed, I had a quote from a builder at $500 to patch + re-seal and I wanted strata to claim under their insurance for the damage to the wall / pay it out of the sinking fund.

It took 1 email and phone call a week to our property manager for SIX MONTHS to fix the issue (OCs fault not his) and in that time mould spread through that room and destroyed the carpet.

Now it was a two bedroom apartment and I lived alone back then and had tenants until the carpet issue, so out of principle I didn't fix it, and when it was finally fixed, the carpet was destroyed which they refused to pay for...

So off to court we went, me a newly minted lawyer working at an investment bank against like... 8 old women who I can rightfully call cunts, this was 2010.

Now, I sold that apartment in 2014 after fixing the carpets and the court case resolved in 2015.

The findings were in my favour, the judge ruled on loss of equity (I proved the sale of the house was reduced due to my inability to maintain the property due to damage) for $30,000, loss of income from 2011 to 2014 @ $200 per week for $62,000, reasonable legal fees equal to my regular employment hourly rate for $12,500, plus interest at 10% simple interest for a total of $120,000.

Now they appealed this twice THIS year and have run out of appeals, they can't pay it as they have $23,000 in their sinking fund and are now raising a special levy on 24 apartments of $5,000 each to pay me.

I don't need the money at all, but I'm going to take it and refund 50% of the $5,000 to the units who are not on the OC."

"It depends on what she's asking of him, getting him to do, what she does in return, all the tiny details of how exactly she responds to his crush, etc.

A more obvious example of this would be the popular girl in highschool getting some nerdy kid who has a crush on her to carry her books and do her homework with no reciprocation of any kind, no return favors. It's a give and take relationship. The nerdy kid is strung along by false hope and perceived closeness gained from doing favors, giving the popular girl an emotional slave. Even if she's set boundaries. Even if she's told him no. Worse still if she knows full well what she's doing, then she's directly at fault rather than unknowingly causing unhealthy behavior to occur.

This may not be the actual case here - I'm an unrelated third party - but it's certainly possible to set boundaries and then emotionally manipulate people and take advantage of them. With some people it may be very easy to manipulate them, but that doesn't make it any less bad or unhealthy."

Since sqrt(3)s&lt;2s there is a configuration that allows an equilateral triangle to be dropped.

A good idea is to always carry more medication then you think you will need, especially if it is something like malaria tablets, birth control, insulin or anything really important.

- Student loans. What to look for when applying, how to set up effective payment plans. I have so many friends who are still YEARS from paying off their student loans. When I ask them how much they pay per month, they admit that they're barely paying above the minimum. Doing this you're really only paying the interest and hardly touching the principle!

"(1. Give them room.

Without the proper room to grow, whoever you're raising may feel like they're in a cage. If that becomes their comfortable place, it will be much harder for them to experience the real world when independence is finally given to them.

(2. Treat them like adults when they're ready.

A lot of parents will nag their kids. Whether it's telling them to do chores, get better grades, work harder, etc. The more you nag them, the more they rely on your voice to guide them through their everyday tasks. Although it can be hard, remember that it can be extremely beneficial for them to learn from their own mistakes. You don't have to neglect them in any way, but making sure they never fail is something that could hurt them int he long run.

Also, keep in mind that if you want them to act like adults, treat them like such. It's not fair to accept independence if you don't let them be independent.

(3. Respect them.

I'm hearing this statement all the time; ""We're your parents, not your friends."" In my opinion, it's bogus. Your parents are your parents, but that doesn't mean they aren't your friends. Treat them like you would want to be treated. They're not your slaves or your pets. Have fun with them. Make sure you set aside enough time to make them feel comfortable expressing themselves in a family environment. Not doing this can cause severe emotional instability.

(4. Create trust.

It's extremely important to invoke a relationship of trust with your children.  If you don't, forget ever knowing what's really going on in their lives. If they don't trust you, they won't be willing to share what's making them upset. For example, my dad had made a promise to me that he would never tell anyone about a certain situation. I proceeded to tell him the truth and what really happened, only to find out that he had told all of his co-workers the next day. To this day, I have a hard time trusting him. From an early age, that foundation was never really developed.

This also creates distrust with other people.

(5. Let them decide their own future.

A lot of parents these days are making every decision for their children. ""*You're going to college at _____*"", ""*You're working at ______*"", ""*If you don't ______ you'll end up _____ for the rest of your life*"". Not only will your kids become extremely stressed by the pressure you force on them in conforming to your specific requests, but they will have trouble making decisions on their own when they move out."

"Because his statement is an oversimplification.  He frames it as simply housing companies wanting to maximize profits.

"Every statue in that park is naked. This one is on a bridge (or maybe just a path, I don't remember) that has the statues on either side every 10 or so feet and is about 200 feet long, I'd guess.

After the bridge there's a large fountain consisting of naked people holding something up (maybe a chunk of earth?) in the center of a large square.

If you head straight through the square you reach a set of stairs that leads to a large pillar of naked people ringed by circular steps. Dotting the the steps are 3 rows of statues (maybe 30ish total) of naked people experiencing many ranges of human emotion. Primarily focusing on love, family, and cooperation.

I only spent a couple hours in the park and it's been years, so I don't have the best understanding or memory of it, but that's the gist of what I remember."
"Not sure which is better but my three favourites are:

Undertale, because I was apart of the story, my choices had real consequences and as such I felt some real emotion when I saw what I did.

Deus Ex, I love the story in this game because the journey it took me on and how it was told. At every point in the game as your about to go down another rabbit hole the game teases it. How it does this is wildly varied and all ahead of it's time. Sometimes you'll read about it, sometimes you'll overhear a conversation. Best of all the game portrays big concepts with the correct about of black, white and grey. At the end of the day there is no evil just a choice.

The Longest Journey, this game not only has an incredible world to base the story but the main character and her progression from clueless to victory is astounding. The twist at the end is unlike anything I've seen and I truly caught me by surprise but fit the rest of it all so perfectly."

"My dog is great at obeying commands, not so great at understanding things on his own.


My favorite example: I built him a doghouse in the yard. It was wooden, square, with a pretty big doorway that he could enter freely. One day, it started raining.


My dog utterly hates rain. He hates the smell of wet grass, the humid atmosphere, the dampness of the ground beneath his feet. This is all based on assumption, naturally, but basically if he sees that it's just rained outside, he will cry like he's just lost all his possessions in a flash flood. That's how much he hates rain.


I thought the doghouse would help alleviate his discomfort with rain. So lo and behold, it started drizzling. My dog started whining, and approached the doghouse while I watched from my bedroom window. My heart swelled with pride as I expected to witness his appreciation for the bastion I had painstakingly crafted for him. But instead of going inside, he went beside it.


And he cowered there, still getting hit by the rain. Of course, he cried harder. I stared, dumbfounded that he couldn't figure out that he had to go inside. Remember [that scene in Ray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOVyhaDQNfw) where his mom watches Ray struggling on the floor and cries to herself, knowing that if she helps him, he'll never learn to help himself? That's how I felt. I thought, if I waited, he'd figure it out and go inside the damn doghouse.


He didn't. He just kept shrinking into himself, cowering against the side of the house and crying louder because he was getting soaked. After 20 seconds, I couldn't stand it anymore, and brought him inside to towel him off and cuddle with him.


Rain or shine, he never did learn how to use the doghouse. I could put him inside and he wouldn't mind, he'd just chill in it (proof that he wasn't scared of the interior) but he never went inside and his impulse was always just to go beside it. I ended up demolishing it."

"I lived in a poor building for a while and would constantly have neighbours asking me to borrow things. Usually I'd be fine with this but they were almost always drunk and belligerent about it.

So I just started saying ""No, sorry, I don't have one of those/use that."" but I'd say it for everything.

One would knock asking for food, I'd say ""Oh, sorry dude, I don't eat.""

Ask to use my toilet ""Oh, sorry dude, I don't need to pee or poo.""

Ask me to charge their phone because their power got cut off ""Sorry dude, deathly allergic to electricity. Don't use it.""

They were such ridiculous, open, bold-faced lies that they never knew how to respond.

I then adopted the same tactic to avoid being questioned/spoken to on the street. Like if someone asks me for change ""Sorry, I don't use currency."" Someone tries to ask me to take a survey or listen to the word of god ""Sorry dude, don't speak English."" (Sometimes I spice that up with bigger words just to be extra obvious ""I apologize profusely, I am utterly incapable of proper use of the English lexicon."")

"Exactly! My biggest pet peeve when looking for recipes online is when I come across one that sounds like it might be good in the link, only to open the page and you have to scroll past like 8 long winded and overbearing pages of their narcissistic blog describing every little fucking nanosecond that lead up to the reason why they wanted to make this dish and what goddamn lunar phase the moon was in when they made it before you finally come to the actual recipe. Like, I don't give a fuck that you had some leftover rice wine vinegar or some shit because you accidentally bought too much when you had that awful summer garden party (here's a link to the party, btw! Pictures included!) and made a fucking salad dressing 6 goddamn months ago. I don't need to know about any of that shit! Do you really think people are THAT interested in your life? Because chances are, they probably fucking aren't. Shut the fuck up and just give me the damn recipe, you dick. A little description, maybe some notes, and the recipe. That's all I need.

I dunno maybe I'm just a bitter asshole, but that shit annoys me to no end. "
"When I was a kid, I clearly didn't know what sex was... just that it was something very, very bad. 

Cut to a time when I'm riding in the car with my mom. She had her driver's license out for some reason, and I was looking at it. Suddenly I blurt out, ""Sex: F. Way to go mom!""

Since clearly failing at the bad thing must be the best result, right?

"Not me, but I was at a restaurant once, hanging out with some friends, and there was a couple sitting at the table next to ours. One of the guys spent maybe TWO HOURS talking about all the guys he'd fucked and going into very thorough detail for every single one of them, the other looked like he wanted to disappear from the face of the planet and didn't say a single word. We happened to leave the restaurant at the same time, and I've never seen anybody say goodbye and sprint to his car that fast!"

As a man who is bad with most people let alone women I feel the most sexy when a woman compliments me and laughs with me at my jokes. I also feel sexy when a gay man hits on me. I'm bi and I truly love it when a man starts flirting with me just because he thinks I'm cute. I'm not tiny and don't find myself cute but to my surprise men think I'm cute. I just feel sexy when people show me I am 😌

"Thats not what he meant. He isnt talking about someone not wanting to hire a woman because they are ugly. Its that when they look at a male candidate they might look 75 percent on his resume and qualifications and 25% on physical appearance. Women on the other hand have their looks put at the forefront of their interviews and opportunities more often. So an employer may look 50% at her resume and 50% at her appearance. Like during the election cycle the media will talk about a male politicians speaking gaffs, and his policy mess ups, but ignore his suit or haircut. But a female politician will be critiqued for her pantsuit or her new haircut. On top of that a woman exhibiting traditionally male behaviors will be criticized heavily, even if a male performing that same behavior might be praised. A woman who is strong and decisive will be called uptight and bossy while a man would be called exactly that, strong and decisive. Its not about biology, its about the way society has been conditioned to value/devalue certain qualities depending on which gender is exhibiting them. Strength/stubborness/aggression is valued in men, not women. Daintiness/meekness/shyness are valued in women, not men. Prettiness/attractiveness is valued highly in both genders, but is valued more in women than it is in men. "

"The criminalization of male genital mutilation. 

:edit:

With the development of this thread in sight, I guess I should edit this post and include an explanation. I'm quoting myself from a different post:

&gt; The reason why I'm saying non-consensual circumcision should be illegal (as opposed to merely inadvisable) is that it would give victims of it the opportunity to retroactively seek legal justice. The way things are right now, this is simply not possible. Not only that, but as you can tell by the responses in this thread alone, people are actually ridiculed for finding it objectionable that their genitals were unnecessarily operated on at an age where they couldn't possibly consent. It's so much the status quo that it's actually scary.

:edit#2:

Also, in regards to the medical benefits: My point is not to deny or to even just downplay potential benefits. My point is that it should be an optional medical procedure that *informed adults* can choose to have done. It should not be a default thing that's done to every newborn male. This is where the World Health Organization and the AAP actually agree with me 100%, even though people in this thread are conveniently ignoring it."

"Old post from a similar question so I just pasted it over:
*************
I went to a party in high school that made me believe in mass hysteria similar to wartime germany. I've never seen so many normal become so destructive on the turn of a dime.

This chick who was kind of a bitch threw a house party while her parents were out of town. A lot of the school showed up. Guess she thought too many people were there and so she announces that she called the cops. This didn't sit well with people for some reason and everyone basically rioted. I'm in the basement and see one kid playing golf threw the glass panes of the French doors, and then throwing the tv remote through the ones he missed. I pass a bathroom and a guy is standing on the sink, jumps down smashing through all the drawers that he opened and then awkwardly putting the drawers back in like nothing happened. Then he starts cutting the bottoms of the shampoo bottles out and arranging them like normal. I make my way to the stairs to see a portly kid run down them, use the couch at the bottom as a trampoline and slam into the drywall, leaving a nice Mexican sized hole. Upstairs in the kitchen, one kid from band class is emptying spice bottles up in the back of the cutlery drawer because fuck oregano, and then he grabs some tin foil, throw it in the microwave and set it for 10 minutes and walk away.

People start escaping out to the back deck/yard because it opened to a big field and an easy escape from the cops. One of the neighbors was outside yelling at everyone and this guy walks out with a stack of dinner plates and proceeds to throw them into the darkness, and one directly at the neighbor. 

A group of guys were standing on the deck trying to make sure everyone was with them, but they realize they are missing one and it was too hard to go back in through the door while everyone is flooding out, so one guy throws a lawn chair through the glass window, and their fucking buddy comes bounding out like he somehow psychically knew the path was made for him.

At this point in the chaos, I'm like fuck this and I'm up climbing over the wooden fence which is the only way out, but some people cannot make it over the fence so they start to push the entire fence over- this fence was also every neighbors fence as it was all connected, but it just buckled over like some kind of cheap zombie speedbump. 

And that was the day I learned of the Innate violence of man.

"We made green slime in chemistry and our chemistry teacher told us that we had to turn what we made in at the end of class as prior students had gotten the stuff everywhere.  I decided to be cute and made two batches, one to hand in to the teacher and the other to keep.  I got away with that but I wasn't finished...

I had this problem called curiosity so when I went walking into the library while toying with the green slime in my hand, I glanced at a large fan on top of the librarian's counter and pondered what would happen if I tossed the slime into it.  With a hypothesis in mind (because this was all very scientific, you know), I put it to the test and tossed in the slime.  Hundreds of little splatting sounds as flecks of green slime flew across the library and hit objects.  It was far better than I imagined.  The librarian leaped up from her chair and dashed over to me.  She looked straight at me as I was the only one standing next to the fan and--I kid you not--she asked me who did it.  I was the only freaking person by the fan....There wasn't even anybody else in the whole damn library!

I couldn't believe it.  I told her that two boys that I didn't know threw it in and ran out of the library and she went chasing after these non-existent boys.  It didn't matter that the library doors made a loud metal thunk when they closed and that sound was totally absent after the slime hit the fan.  Apparently, my word was good enough.  

Got away with prohibited slime AND thoroughly sliming the library.  Edit:  In hindsight, I think that, considering the newly created prohibition of not being able to keep the slime was due to the fact that students got it everywhere, I felt challenged to do the same...but better.

TLDR:  Got away with doubling a recipe of green slime in high school chemistry class so I could keep the prohibited slime.  Then, got away with throwing the slime into a library fan, causing it to splatter everywhere even though I was the only one next to the fan. "

I've worked with homeless people and charities for the homeless. A big problem they found was that there's no *dignity* in just saying ""here's a place to live, go live in it"". People want to choose where they live (to be near networks and family, for example) and they want (need?) to be able direct their lives instead of just being told what to do and where to go.

You need programs that are going to follow up with people, help them adjust to being homed, help them get trained and in work... without all that, a house is not going to help very much.  

So maybe building homes and making them available to the homeless can start to help some people, but it's not a solution in and of itself. It's not a simple problem, and the solution isn't simple either."

"actually, most people in los feliz pronounce it ""los FEE-liss"" although some pronounce it with the proper spanish pronunciation. no one to my knowledge uses a long ""e"" on both syllables of ""feliz""

it's actually a signification source of contention in older vs newer inhabitants of the area. lived there for three years; if memory serves, older inhabitants pronounced it ""fuh-LEES"" while the younger set tended towards a more anglicized pronunciation. although interestingly, ""los"" is definitively pronounced exactly as the spanish word, as opposed to today's general pronunciation of LA, in which ""los"" is pronounced ""loss""

I drove 20 minutes to the office, looked at the printer, and saw ""Please place paper in drawer.""  "

"Well, seeing kids who are registered as 10/11 year olds attempting to have cyber sex isn't great. Especially watching their multiple attempts to bypass the filters and poor understanding about how it actually works.

Weirdest was probably at the old site I used to work for which has a much older cult-following type of fanbase. We had a user post on the chat board that he was going to kill himself, and the details and tone of the post were serious and concerning. We contacted our safety specialist who did some detective work and contacted the user's local police department. Usually we don't hear what happens after that, but several months later that user came back and posted that we saved his life that night because the police did come to his door that night and he was able to get some help. 

That or all the tentacle/furry porn art and roleplay that used to get posted."

"As an instructor, and yes there is a big difference between instructor and DM not just nitpicking, I personally think being a DM is a ton of fun. You just help with classes and students. You don't really have the same liability as instructors most of the time. If you are working in a tropical location you are doing a large amount of shop chores which is FAR more of what you do instead of tours and classes. Another thing I'd add, and it's a bit unfortunate to a degree, is that a DM is worth less than an instructor. Instructors can teach classes and do everything else a DM can do so they are worth more to a shop. A DM can only do tours, help with classes, and a couple little classes. That being said one of the couple little classes they can do is discover scuba which is hugely popular at resorts so there is that. There are a lot of instructors as well so getting a job as a DM isn't as easy, still doable, but not as easy. A lot of places will actually try and get you to do an instructor internship though, but that quite possibly ends up being really low pay or maybe no pay.

Feel free to PM me if you want. I can give you more specific info on the matter. I have a couple friends that went tropical with their instructing and I am always looking at it as well."

"Movie death: Snape. Come on guys, you can't tell me you didn't feel the emotion welling up in you when he died and his motives revealed.

Book death: Amma from Caster Chronicles. Basically at the end of the main series, the main character is revived from death, but the Order of the world must be balanced. Hence, his caretaker (literally; she's been watching over him since he was 5 and since his dad went into a self-induced retreat from the world) sacrifices herself for him. The way the scene plays out is so sad and heartbreaking.

TV Show Death: Gotta go to Shireen Baratheon in Game of Thrones. Seriously, you're an innocent young girl who was ordered to die by burning on the stake by your own father on the word of a priestess who lacks faith. 

Anime death: Considering I've only ever seen Attack on Titan, I have to go with Eren's first ""death"". It was kind of unexpected and the effect it had on Mikasa and Armin was so profound. "
"I hate that people say this, it's a stupid comment meant to make the people who say it feel superior to others. Any fan of Audrey Hepburn who has read a wikipedia article knows that she did resistance work during WWII and volunteered for UNICEF. Of course people who vaguely know who she is or have only watched a few of her movies will only remember her as a beautiful actress, that was the most public aspect of her life. I doubt she went to Africa thinking, ""Gee I hope everyone sees me doing volunteer works and remembers what a charitable person I was!"""
My dad once bought my mom a dirt bike for her birthday. She was in her 40's at the time. She didn't want a dirt bike. He rode it everyday afterwards.

There's an even chance that an arbitrarily powerful self-improving AI will come into existence at some point in human history. This AI will eventually learn who did and did not contribute to its' creation, however indirectly. Because we assume the AI to be throughly anthropomorphic it will become angry and punish everyone who did not help create it.

"That's not the etymology at all. The word doctor derives from the latin *docere*, meaning ""to show, to teach, to cause to know"". It was originally used up to the 14th century to describe a religious teacher and adviser, often a member of the clergy. In the late 14th century it came to be used for ""holder of the highest degree at a university"", and over the next two centuries it transitioned to mean ""medical professional"". 

So historically it meant a religious advisor, for two centuries it meant PhD, and then it meant PhD and MD. "

They run a small poor family owned grocery store...well more like a grocery shack that sells southeast Asian goods. This business has been around since the 1990s, and these guys decided to bring in a sawed off shot gun to a bunch of old small stubby straight-outta-a-studio-ghibli-film-innocent defenseless Asian women who could probably die of a heart attack. The strange thing was that, the owner was going to make a deposit that day and happened to have the purse she always uses to put the deposit money in. Just as she was about to make the trip to the bank, they robbed the store. So that says they've been observing her for awhile and how the store runs.  


Of course in a panick they didn't know how to react when held up, and the assholes decided to raise hell by shooting at the ceiling and the walls. They took the money, ran to their getaway car parked across the street, and now the owner is too afraid to go back to her shop and they will have to close the store eventually.

"I have a good one here. A few years ago I was seeing a girl who'd had problems with drink. She would get past a certain point of drinking and a switch would flip and you know the night was FUBAR.  She was lovely off the booze though and my friends and I really wanted to make it work. Possibly after another embarrassing night out, she had decided she didn't want to go one of my two best friends wedding because she felt they didn't like her any more. Nothing could be further from the truth, they just wanted her and I to be happy, so they made a special effort and invited her specifically saying they'd love her to be there... We accepted and the TIFU train was set in motion...

The fateful day arrived, and everyone was in good spirits. It was a British humanist affair at a barn in the Cotswolds, a beautiful location, but typically awful British weather. We ate lunch first and I noticed she was getting well lubricated, I subsequently found out when she was pleading for free shots of gin at the bar. We were talking to some older friends of the bride and groom and as she was insisting on getting selfies with them loudly shouting I could feel the day slightly slipping from my grasp.... Quiet words and pleading with her to slow down were doing nothing sadly. 

Soon it was time for the speeches and we were moving to a separate barn. I noticed I'd forgot my camera though, and went to the car to get it. By the time I got back though, the barn doors were closed and they were in full swing, so I thought I'd wait it out outside rather than interrupt. Which went very well until the barn doors were swung open by my drunken missus at the end of the speeches, her screaming in front of everyone about how she'd lost me and I could have been 'hanging from a tree' somewhere. (I'd had depression in the recent past)

So, after my friends had finished saying how fine it was that this was happening, and they could deal with it (amazing friends to say the least) my girlfriend decided to hit the afterburners:

- Many of my and her sexual fantasies were discussed with the grooms friends from university. 

- Propositioned the grooms best mate in front of several people.

- The groom's grandfather who had advanced vascular dementia was treated to her sitting on his lap and was told to get out of his wheelchair and dance with her. 

- She is in almost all of the group photos, at the front, kicking her legs in the air can-can style in many of them. (It could easily be argued that my friend has had many of these printed and put up around his family home 'for the lolz' of course, as he has dined off this story ever since)

- She went out into the car park as people were leaving to go home opening random car doors asking if people were 'going clubbing' and asking if she could tag along. 

Eventually she was starting to slow down and another very long suffering friend of mine offered to take her home with me, for which I will be eternally grateful. Once in the car and finally heading away from the wedding thank god, 'the missus' literally fought us both in the back seat whenever she gained consciousness (ex South Yorkshire judo champion). 

To be honest, along with the thunder and lightning, biblical rainfall outside the car, things were getting a bit surreal. It was at this point my friend's wife had had enough of struggling to drive with this flailing beast smacking her about every few minutes, so she threw us out some ten minutes from home, totally justifiably. 

Alas, the cool night air and rain rather awoke the beast, and her aim was to fight me, or throw herself in front of traffic. I did my level best to keep her hands off me, and keep her from lying on the white line but a few got through, and she was nearly as strong as I was.

I eventuallly thought that I'd probably had enough drama for the day, so I called the police, and the riot van turning up with sirens and blues and two's going topped the day off for me... Being in the van thankfully had a calming effect on her and I just had to deal with her spitting on me like some demon from a horror film. &lt;fin&gt;

It's also not about men keeping their pants on, it's about understanding that people are equals and should all be treated with respects.

I wake up the next morning in a pool of my own blood...brother is freaking out and mother is trying to figure out what the hell happened. I walk outside and see right next to the campfire my used pad that somehow slipped out of my skirt and onto the ground for all the world to see. Unfortunately for me the public was already wandering the grounds so many people had seen my nasty used blood rag before I even knew it was gone. Needless to say I only buy winged pads now."

"I was in a park drinking from a Jack Daniels with one guy friend and a new coworker.  ~19yo?

Apparently I walked down to the waters edge and climbed the rocks (totally something I'd do sober).  Guy friend, also soldier in training, couldn't get me away to safety though and I started acting funny.  Then suddenly I passed out.  So he called am ambulance who had to use a ski-style flat stretcher to get me back on land. 

I woke in the hospital with the worst hangover of my life with my friend at my side.  Apparently the coworker upon seeing my condition up and disappeared.  This coupled with the crazy way I just passed out and woke up totally fucked up, made my friend think I was actually drugged by the coworker.  

Makes sense and I kind of recall hearing something along those lines from the doctor, but I was totally out of it during the hospital release.  We had been drinking beers and dancing for hours before the bottle of Jack, but I mean I was fucked up for days."

"I suffered heat stoke while at football camp in the 10th grade. The full story is actually a really long one, but I do remember waking up in the hospital with no memory of how I got there. I was still very much outside my mind when I came to in the hospital and my initial thought upon waking up was that I had been abducted by the government and that the doctors were going to perform experiments on me. You haven't lived until you experience an event where you sincerely and truly believe that you're going to die.  I honestly thought that if I didn't escape id be killed. My adrenaline went through the roof and I fought my hardest to escape the hospital. I even punched a doctor. But heat stroke sucks all the emery from your body and really fatigues your muscles. I didn't get far on foot before completely collapsing from lack of muscle control. I was so convinced I was going to die that when they got me back into the bed and strapped me down I laid there and prayed to God. I'm not very religious, but I made peace with my maker and drifted off to sleep. I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up a few hours later. "

"I once broke a tooth in a shoe lace tying accident.  

I was 11 or 12ish. It was the height of the late 70's skateboard craze and while riding on my bright orange incredibly narrow board of danger I noticed that one of my shoe laces was untied.  
Thinking that this could be a dangerous if not attended to I stopped, stepped off my board and bent down to address the issue.  
While reaching down for my shoe lace I instinctively lifted up my foot and placed it down on the nearest object to make it easier to reach.  
The nearest object was the end of my skateboard which chose to obey the laws of physics, flipped up and smacked me hard in the mouth.  
As I walked home spitting blood and bits of tooth I was pretty happy that none of my friends had been around to witness the incident."

"I agree that you shouldn't praise someone for no reason, but I disagree that getting made up isn't an accomplishment: being good at makeup, hair, and sometimes fashion are skills that take a lot of practice and effort. Try doing a winged liner and a smokey eye as a guy and see how it goes. Plus you can make good money doing it if you're talented enough. 

Other hobbies traditionally labelled feminine also take skill: Dancing, sewing, crafts, baking etc. "

"I am very very pale and the amounts crap I get for it is ridiculous. I have gotten so many damn comments while walking down the street from some random dude saying things like 'aye girl, holy shit, you need a tan' or 'have you ever heard of this thing called a sun' or 'spray tan that shit lady' (ALL of my immediate family members on my moms side have had 5+ basal cell skin cancer surgeries and a few on my dads side have had melanoma, my mom had a five hour procedure on her face while awake to remove skin cancer from the right side of her lip where she now has a large scar to match the other scars on her face.)  

My favorite was when this kid in elementary school came up to me with a white crayon and a tan crayon and said this is you and this is me. He was the cutest boy in the class and until that moment in life I had never even known I was pale, or never thought of it as a bad thing. I bawled for hours right after and later that day to my mom.  I had at one point in time 23 (no joke) bottles of self tanner under my sink. Birthday/Christmas money was spent on tanner. Every single one would just make me orange, blotchy and smelly. Also hate it when girls talk about how pale they are and how ugly they felt during the winter. Girl do you not see me standing next to you?? I actually can't tan and don't want to risk having skin cancer when I'm older by attempting to tan and ending up fried. I'm a dancer and people would always joke after shows 'wow you really glowed up there tonight' I was also required to get a spray tan for recruitment for my sorority (yeah.. I was in one..) and I refused to. 

Sorry is something wrong with being very white??

Everyone thinks I live some super comfortable cozy life because I am white but don't know of the years that I desperately wanted to change my skin to be tanned and was extremely depressed. Finally accepted my whiteness after 22 years and am able to laugh off when I hear comments from people, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt when people make rude or mean comments."
"I'm fairly new to reddit so forgive me if my formatting is terrible, but here's my story.

On January 3rd, 2014 my wife and I were in the kitchen making breakfast for our two sons. (ages 4, and 2) Now, my wife and I aren't typically morning people but that day we were in a great mood. We had gotten just the right amount of sleep, I had the day off from work and the kids had slept peacefully throughout the night without wetting the bed. Our upstairs neighbors had also been pretty quiet the night before so we were able to relax and enjoy our evening without thinking our ceiling was going to cave in from them being rowdy and stomping around all hours of the night. Basically it was just a perfect morning for us. My wife and oldest were making pancakes, or as they liked to call them ""Canpakes"" (it was an inside joke between the two of them.) and I was playing with my younger son. 


My phone starts ringing as my wife is putting on some eggs and bacon, this immediately strikes us as odd because all my friends/family know that I like to sleep in late on my days off and that I rarely get enough sleep with two young children running around the apartment constantly. So we know if our phone rings before 10am that it's usually someone we don't care to speak to, or that something is wrong. As soon as I answer the phone my mom says ""I know it's early, but I need to talk to you. Something has happened to your step-brother.""


 She goes on to tell me that he was found unconscious in his mom's home in western Virginia earlier that morning and that he's been non-responsive to the paramedics/doctors since. They weren't sure what had happened but they were trying to find out. I could hear my step-father in the background talking to someone but couldn't make out what exactly what was being said, just that he didn't sound like his normal self. My mom tells me that she'll keep me updated and we hang up. It must've put me in shock or something because I didn't say anything for about fifteen minutes and my wife was starting to freak out. He had just moved back to Virginia about five months before this.


My brother had a lot of health problems back then. He had been diagnosed with epilepsy a couple years prior, and since then had started using drugs fairly often. Usually it was just pot, he said that it helped with the seizures. But my brother was also young, he was in his early 20's so he did quite a bit of partying and there had been several times where I had literally found him passed out somewhere or working off some high from something harder in some random place. Hell, one time he tried to walk into someone else's house and then when he realized he couldn't get his key to unlock the front door he called my step-father and asked him if he changed the locks. 


Anyway, the partying and the stupid stunts that he always pulled usually caused us to butt heads. The guy was smart, I mean nearly genius level intellect and it always pissed me off that he just wasted that intelligence and potential. I wanted better things for him than waking up in a gutter to shake off a bad trip. He knew that, but he always told me it was his life and that he'd live it however he wanted. Eventually we grew apart and the last things we said to one another were basically ""Screw you."" Now here I was, wondering what had happened to him and if he was going to be okay.


A few hours later my mother called back and told me that his mom had left a few days before new years eve and went on a cruise with her husband, leaving my step-brother and one of his friends at her house to watch over the place while they were gone. Well apparently my brother decided that he had wanted to celebrate the new year in the best way he knew how; fucked up. He had made it through the festivities without any incidents. (Usually there were signs he would have a seizure soon.) But while he was working off his hangover he had suffered a grand mal seizure. His friend had found him passed out in the bathroom that morning and after trying for about 20 minutes to wake him up called 911. 


At this point I was scared out of my mind. I had always figured that one day he and I would talk again and he would finally just get why I was hard on him. I mean he was my little brother, of course I loved him. I just wanted better for him and as much as I tried to hang in there and be there for him I didn't want to watch him destroy his life. I figured we'd have that ""I finally get why you were that way."" conversation and things would go back to being like how they were when we were kids. I'll never have that conversation with him now. The doctors pronounced him brain dead two days later and my step-father pulled the plug on January 6th after driving all the way from Atlanta to Virginia. (My brother had told us all that if he had ever ended up in a situation like this that he didn't want to be kept alive by a machine, I think he knew somehow.) 


It fucked me up pretty bad and I still can't think about him without getting emotional. I wish I had said and done so many things differently, most of all I wish I had gotten the chance to at least say I was sorry, so yeah. that pretty much turned our perfect morning into one of the worst weeks of my life. Now I don't ever act like I'll have time to do something later, and I try to never leave shit unresolved with my friends/family.  


TL;DR: Having the perfect morning with my family when I find out that my estranged step-brother suffered a grand mal seizure that led to his death.

He's always been like an uncle to my cousin and they're happy that, if he's ever curious, it's someone he will already have some close relationship with and will have this bond with and is someone they love and trust. Despite all this, he knows and accepts that it is their son, not his, but that he simply helped his best friend and her wife do what would make them happy.

"There are only a handful of species who have sex for enjoyment; humans, Dolphins, primates, and pigs to name a few. Along with this, many dicks in the animal kingdom are corkscrew shaped. The most common of which are ducks and pigs. Now our little friends do not always have the same amount of turns or spirals in their dicks, with it changing based upon whether their penis is erect or not. For example, pig dicks generally corkscrew once when flaccid, but do so roughly six times when erect.

My favorite aspect of this all is that considering pigs have sex for pleasure according to many accounts, it is not so simple for them to perform coitus. They cannot simply stick it in due to the shape of their members. In order to mount the female, the male must essentially screw himself in by rotating his hips in a circular motion until her is firmly in. A beautiful image to imagine."

"Probably not what you're looking for but I worked on a film that shot in the parking lot of the abandoned Six Flags in New Orleans that was closed after the damage from Katrina.

One night one of our guards calls us because he heard a woman screaming from inside the park.

Let me set the scene for you - this place is located in the worst part of NoLa. It's basically in the middle of a swamp. There are alligators (a 12 footer in the main pond), poisonous snakes and wild boar *all over the place*. It's not lit up at night at all.
It's also the place where stolen cars and other property are dumped. The street in front of it (Lake Forest) is known for locals driving up and down shooting guns out of their cars into the air.

Back to our regularly scheduled programming:

I arrive at the park the same time the cops do. They've found a car in front of the gate on the service road that accesses the rear of the park. While shining lights in the car they see a gun in the front seat.

I'm standing there with 5 NOPD and their 3 squad cars and I start to unlock the gate, thinking we're going in to look for the screaming woman.

This brave cop says ""I'm not going in there.""

I say no it's fine, I'm the site rep and I know the park, I can navigate.

All five refuse. They have arsenals in their trunks and spot lights, and we know a woman was screaming inside but they refuse.

All of the sudden we see a white guy emerge from the blackness and the cops question him. He says his gun is a pellet gun *and they take his word for it without looking at the gun.*

I saw the gun too, and it didn't look like an airsoft gun or anything like that to me.

He also claims he was just inside with his friends taking pictures.

Not only do they *let* him leave, they *make* him leave.

My guards and I spread out to every access point and roved around them until the sun came up. No one else ever came out of the park. When the sun was up I went in with my other site rep. We drove around on ATV's searching everywhere and never saw a sign of anyone.

There are two huge lagoons full of gators and we feared that if the guy had done something to a girl all he had to do was toss her in the lagoon and her body would have been eaten.

Nothing else ever came of it and NOPD never came back to search."

It just takes a little practice but once you have it down you can nail it every time, and same with the hollandaise sauce.

""You're the only one who understands what I've been through and still cares about me, you can't leave."" (We both grew up in very abusive households, but while I knew my upbringing was fucked-up and was in therapy and stuff trying to deal with it, he still saw that behavior as totally normal at that point.)

It just kept escalating further and further. We were fighting and I tried to leave his apartment because I was terrified and he kept blocking the door and pushing me back. Finally I shoved him out of the way and left. He followed me and kept pushing me around and punching me saying that he had to do it because I had pushed him and it was the only way he had of defending himself against my bad temper. He had bruises (he was a skinny little dude who bruised if you breathed on him) and I didn't, and he used that nonstop to ""prove"" what an awful, violent person I was and to say that I couldn't tell anyone about what he did because no one would believe me anyway. 

A week later I lost my virginity to him because he told me it was the only way to make him happy enough that he'd stop hitting me. It wasn't. Instead I got to deal with him hitting me AND constantly pressuring me into sex or having sex with me while I was asleep, shit like that. I couldn't talk to any of my friends because he'd go ballistic thinking I was cheating on him. Literally the only people I was allowed to be around were the guys in my band, and he hated them too. 

I didn't cope. I just put my head down and took it for like four years. I was stubborn, so I didn't give into a lot of his demands about my appearance, etc. but they were always there. I remember one time convincing him to ""let"" me hug my friends again and thinking that it was this major victory. I had been raised that no one would ever, ever love me, so when someone said they did, I stuck with them. When I finally worked up the balls to leave, he stalked me for like six months. He called me up on Christmas day screaming at me because one of our mutual friends mentioned seeing me at a concert with a male friend. "

"Here's the advice for everyone, and seriously, the sooner you do this the better - even if you've been in a home 5 years already. 

Pay extra every month and put that into your principle, even f it's $50 to $100.  


Let's say your loan is $250,000, at 5%. 30 year loan. 

If you paid an extra $50 per month, applied to your principle, that 30 year loan is ONLY 27 Yrs 8 Months, and you saved $21,298.29 in interest. 

Now let's say you pay $100 extra per month. 25 Yrs 9 Mts instead of 30 years, and you saved $38,730.72. 


The more you put into it in the beginning of your loan, the better. So if you don't have kids and stuff at first, throw as much as you can for the first few years, then taper it off as you go. You will not regret this when your kids are starting to move out of the house and it's time for you to sell. "

You want to do anything to make it stop, but doctors refuse. Sometimes they come twice, sometimes they pop up uninvited, but it can strike at any time and make you feel dead inside. 

Worst part of being male: Being considered ""weak"" or ""not manly"" for showing emotion or having a softer side - if a girl does something outside of stereotypical norms, she's progressive, if a man does something he's considered a joke. We're more likely to be automatically branded as creeps if we do the exact same thing as they do, too.

"I was an intern at a general contracting company in San Francisco, CA. At the time, I was 20 yrs old. Now, I was on a team with ~5 other people managing a 14 story apartment being built. This meant managing labor foremen as well as subcontractor foremen. Now, if you know anything about foremen, you probably know that they have been in the business for quite a while. Many of them have been in their trade since before I was born... and I was telling them what to do. It was awkward for me for the first week or so, but I soon realized that this was just the hierarchy of the job. The foremen all knew that their job was to do what their subcontract gave them the responsibility to do and that any person from the general contractor could ask tell them to do something (I found the most effective way to be asking them instead of telling). That is just the way the construction industry works. Granted, these foremen were getting paid six figures to listen to an lowly intern tell them to fix their work.

So, in summary, no. Not really. "

"I was a passenger in my cousin's land cruiser on his family's game farm near the border of Botswana in South Africa. I think I was about 14y old, we were out hunting antelope when I heard  a number whine/zip sounds. My Coz shouts ""get the fuck down"" (he was in the military) and then floors the vehicle. At this point I had realized that we were being shot at....wtf. now I grew up on a farm in a remote area of South Africa and had been around guns all my life. Still scared the living crap out of me. My Coz drives like a bat out of hell dodging trees and ant hills until we get to the river bank where he shouts at me "" fucking run jong"". We jump out and run for the bank(erosion bank think tiny grand canyon). Now we haven't heard any further shots and I am a little freaked out. Coz pokes his head up and takes a look around, turns to me and says""Fucking poachers, I am going to get them. You follow the river until you get to the road and flag someone down and call for help."" I am thinking wth...so I start walking crouched low, I have no idea where the bad guys are or how far the fucking road is. Anyway about 3 hrs later I finally get to the road and there is Coz waiting for me. There were 2 bullet holes in the cruzer, he also said that he wasn't able to catch up with the poachers but he would be keeping an eye out for them... I remember the sound, it sounded nothing like I thought it would. Didn't even hear the bang it was just zip zip wing. Yea that and the hyena incident and the time I was downtown Durban and some shit went down...tired need to go to sleep."

"I was a chef for a famous all-inclusive hotel chain.

One day I was approached in the kitchen and told I needed to pack my bags and move 3000 miles away to fix a labor issue at another hotel. I happily obliged, but negotiated a deal where I would have my choice of any hotel location after I successfully fixed the labor issue. 

I arrived at the new hotel and proceeded to diligently address the labor problem, while also taking over dinner service for 750 people.

After a few months the labor issue had been fixed and settled, and the kitchen was running as smoothly as I like. I asked my manager about when I could make the move to another hotel per our arrangement, and I was told since I had done such a good job they were going to make me stay where I was for an indeterminate amount of time - ie forever.

I let my management know this was unacceptable, and I demanded I be transferred in accordance with the original agreement that got me on a plan in the first place. I was told they would work on it. 

I gave them a 3 week window to address the issue - to give them time to discuss it with the head office etc. I told them if they did not come through in 3 weeks I would walk off the job and never look back.

After 3 quiet weeks I politely asked my manager if my transfer had come through or at least was still in the works. It was not.

The next morning I gave the entire dinner staff the day off and told them not to answer any work calls. I set up the kitchen as if I were prepping dinner - onions and herbs in hotel pans full of water with foil covers, garlic sizzling in pans, etc.

I kept the charade up until around 4:30pm at which time I left the kitchen, went to my room, picked up my bags and went to the lobby to wait for my ride. The manager came out freaked (there were 750 pre paid dinner reservations that night and NO food) and told me if I walked out I would never work for the company again. I laughed, shook his hand and said goodbye. 

I never looked back and never talked to anyone there ever again. This was 20+ years ago.

"Oh man this is so important. I think, it's absolutely crucial to view movements from their own base in reality, and with the best of intentions *first*, before moving on to it's fringes.

This is because people can label themselves with no effort at all, and in a second gain instant publicity that pushes their image to masses of people at once. Movements are being defined by the worst of their constituents instead of the best, and that's become incredibly polarizing.

For every political campaign and every social movement, it's worth considering what would portray a cause or candidate in the best possible light. Find something about it that's agreeable, because chances are there will be SO many more counterexamples.

I mean, people on reddit generally seem to understand the concept that Anonymous is largely decentralized. One Anonymous hacker doesn't define the next, so why should a couple feminists? 

Or MRA's? Or Trump supporters? Or BLM? Or Gamergaters? Or Bernie supporters?

These are movements and organizations that can be perceived negatively because of some human element, but it's a lot less stressful to look at their redeeming factors instead. It's made browsing reddit and the rest of the internet a lot more tolerable."

"I grew up in a nasty house. My parents and brother kept bringing animals home, mainly cats. At one point I remember we had 15 cats and 6 dogs in a 3br home and nobody cleaned the litter pans or let the dogs out. Which meant the animals would shit and piss everywhere else. As I got older, I became embarrassed every time my friends would ask if I wanted them to bring a change of clothes to school so I wouldn't smell like cat. I started to keep my room shut at all times, swept and mopped my room daily, kept air fresheners and air purifiers going at all times, and always took a shower right before leaving somewhere.

"Exactly. The sentiment isn't ""Don't stop til someone wins,"" it's ""Stop fighting and apologize to each other."" It's not a No Holds Barred  WWE match, it's a relationship.

Leave it to Reddit to take an adage about loving your spouse literally and blaming their own hardheadedness on the saying. No, it's not a bad rule. It's that you're too stubborn to apologize and too thick to realize the adage is telling you to stop doing that."

""Daddy, I have something to tell you.""

""What's up?""

""I think I'm a lesbian.""

2. I don't wipe at all, and I just bidet, which seems to just spray poop all over the bowl and my ass cheeks. It's like spraying a hose at a bowl full of dirt. The bowl gets clean, but where does the dirt go? Now I'm wet *and* poopy. 

3. I wipe, I bidet, but I use my hand to really get in there. Maybe even grab a bar of soap. Then I feel comfortable sitting on a towel to dry off.

"Off the top of my head.

When I was an infant, I contracted rotavirus. I was on some sort of iv and antibiotics for a while.

Around age 5, I rode my trike down the driveway out into the street in front of an oncoming car.

By age 8, I started doing gymnastics. I thought it would be a good idea to try a flip off the trampoline into the foam pit unsupervised. Landed head first and could've very easily broken my neck.

I was climbing a tree around age 13 and the limb I was standing on broke. I fell about 12 feet on to my back.

When I was 15, there was this really big snow storm. I went out and built a big ramp at the bottom of the hill. I thought it would be funny to ride off the ramp sitting upright. I almost broke my spine on the landing.

I got my learners permit at age 16. I didn't know how fast you were supposed to go around a turn, because the turns I had made before were always at stop signs. Tried taking a turn at an intersection at 40mph. Nearly drove into the ditch and rolled the car.

Around age 17, I was skiing (I had been skiing for a few years prior) and someone learning how to snowboard got out of controll going down a hill that he wasn't ready for. He ran into me and almost took us both off a cliff.

A few months ago, I was riding my dirt bike through a cow field at about 45mph. I hit a nasty bump that was buried in the grass. My handlebars locked sideways and I got some mad air. I have no idea how I managed it, but I got the bike under controll and didn't hit the only tree in the field that was just a few feet away.

I have no idea how I'm still alive or how I havn't managed to break a single major bone either. The worst injury I've had was when I broke my toe while I was running through the house and kicked a door frame. (or maybe those two times I had a fingernail ripped off.)

"I have my grandma's shirt folded and put away by itself. It was the shirt she wore the last time she saw my daughter, who was 7 months old at the time she died. She was very sick towards the end of her life. She had suffered a 10 year battle with COPD and emphysema. She was diagnosed March 9, 2014 with stage 4 liver cancer and died March 12. She raised me into the person I am today. The family hasn't touched her house belongings except a few things here and there. Her calendar in her house is still at March 2014. It's like stepping into a time warp. But anyway... the last time she saw my daughter, her body was battling COPD, emphysema, and advanced liver cancer. Yet she surprised us one day by driving the hour and a half drive to my house to see my daughter. I have a picture of her (in the shirt I now have) holding her in her lap because she was too weak to hold her in her arms. My daughter is going to be 3 this month and it makes me sad thinking she won't get to know this lovely lady. Now I'm going to have a good cry. Damn it."

My temper is horrible I'll be the first to admit that. One of the quickest ways to set me off is to abuse an animal or a person smaller and weaker than you. On multiple occasions my husband and my family have stepped in front of me and physically hauled my ass away from seriously injuring an abuser. I've even had the cops caked on me for...enthusiastically standing up for a cashier that was being berated by this huge fat man who I tried ever so hard to get to hit me. That's just the kind of psycho I am. I've mellowed out some in my old age and one if the things that helps is something my brother once said to me in one of these instances. There is no physical or mental pain you can inflict on these sick fucks that will ever compare to what awaits them in Hell.  To be fair we were discussing the merits of torture vs straight up killing a motherfucker. Don't worry I'm not dangerous...to most people.

"just happened to me two months ago.  we're still not sure exactly what happened, but i was really tired the day before and i just remember going to bed really early.  i woke up the next morning in the ER with about 7 people standing around me.

i had this strange dream that i was driving drunk and ran into someone and then woke up, my immediate response was to ask my wife if i did something stupid.

anyway, my blood o2 level was extremely low.  my wife couldn't wake me up and i was barely breathing, the paramedics had to intubate me to get oxygen into me.  i was so close to dying and they were very concerned about brain damage.  i was in the icu for 3 days and in a regular bed for 2.  i've been fine since.

i've had so many tests done that i'm tired and don't care anymore, but the only thing they have found is a somewhat enlarged spleen.  i'm waiting on results of a second ultrasound of my abdomen."

I was maybe 9 or 10 at the time. I woke up with a bright light over me with my brother and dad standing next me. My mom was crying in the corner of the room. I had no idea what was going on. I was in pain and my face was wrapped in bandages. Earlier that day I remember I was with my aunt who was picking up her kids from school. I was sitting her in station wagon in the back seat that was facing the rear window. The story I was told was that during the car ride someone rear ended us and my face actually hit the window and went thru it. I do not remember any of this. I have a few scares on my face but nothing notciable. This was almost 20 years ago now.

"There's two (well, several) different definitions of death.

[Clinical death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_death) is when someone's heart and lungs stop working. You can perform CPR to maybe, possibly keep their blood flowing long enough to stave off a more permanent death until doctors arrive. There is a small-but-nonzero chance of coming back from clinical death.

[Brain death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death) is when your brain has shut down for long enough that there's no way to restart it. This usually happens a few minutes after the heart has stopped. At that point, there is no point in trying to revive the person, they are a sack of organs and meat that could be great for saving other peoples' lives in the right situations though.

**Edit**: Oh god, I should stop with my alt-tabbing. Aaanyway, there is hopefully no more porn in this post. "

The issue that arises is nativist jerks point to the people who aren't assimilated as being representative of all immigrants.

OR a free clinic that has a 2-10 week waiting list because you aren't sick enough to go to the ER but know enough that something is wrong but can't afford to miss a day of work to spend the 6hrs for the possible wait time.

C. Even if the doctor does give an immediate diagnosis that just needs medication, good luck affording it if you aren't already on govt assistance. If you land in the ""make too much to be on full govt assistance, but too much for cheaper coverage"" you're just fucked

"I recently learned that fire extinguishers fail at an alarming rate. One of the many reasons they do this, is because the powder in them settles to the bottom of the container and cakes under the pressure.

"Guy-Who-Changes-The-Date-and-Time-of-sporting-events-on-TV.

You know when you're watching TV and sometimes a little advertisement shows up in the corner advertising some sport game or a UFC fight (""Pistons VS Bulls Saturday 6pm"")?  Yeah, that was my job to change the date, time, and team match ups for sporting events.

There needs to be a Saturday @ 6pm.  Tomorrow @ 6pm.  Today @ 6pm. Up Next.  For every sporting event being televised that week.  I created each variation for every event and send them back to the cable network that was airing those games/events.    

The channels also need variations of those match ups with different players too.  So depending on where in the country they're showing that advertisement, it'll will have different players in the little pop-up advertisement.  

""Pistons vs Bulls"" feature Piston Player A and Bulls Player X.  Saturday @ 6pm.  

""Pistons vs Bulls"" feature Pistons Player B and Bulls Player Z.  Saturday @ 6pm.

etc... etc... 

I never followed sports but after a year doing that awful job I became very familiar with most players across all different types of sports and could spout off their stats like I was some kind of sports addict."

"&gt; If you're getting free money from taxpayers because you can't afford food

That's not what Food Stamps are actually for.  Food Stamps--Also known as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program--are to supplement your food budget and allow you to buy better quality foods in addition to thinks like Mac N' Cheese and Ramen Noodles.  When you get the EBT card, they actually tell people to use the card for higher budget Meats and such, because that's what it's there for, to allow them higher quality foods than they had access to without it.

I would say the number one misconception people have about Food Stamps is their actual purpose.  SNAP is basically an agricultural hand-out, because it strictly prohibits buying prepared food, heated up food, and amenities such as seasonings and plasticware or toiletries.  People who qualify for SNAP are probably used to eating the kind of crap that nobody *likes* eating, so the EBT card allows them to eat something resembling healthy food, because a terrible diet can end up costing the system wayyyyyy more than just helping them eat healthier--if they stay low income most of their lives they will be on Medicare\Medicaid, and a crappy diet increases their risk for Heart Disease, Diabetes, Cancer, Liver and Kidney Disease, and a whole bunch of other (expensive) health problems."

"I think part of it is that it can be very insulting to say you are Scottish just because your ancestors were. It diminishes the value of a national identity. To me, what makes a person Scottish (or any nationality) has nothing to do with where your grandparents grew up or what your name or skin colour is. It's about actually spending time in that place. Growing up in Scotland and being moulded by its landscape, politics, media, humour, food, communities etc. That shared cultural experience is what makes you Scottish or Irish or Italian and so on. So when someone who has never set foot in Scotland and has no idea about the culture of the country beyond superficial stereotypes says ""hey I'm Scottish too!"", I can understand the response being fuck off. It's like they haven't earned the right to call themselves Scottish. And to think that all it takes to be Scottish is to have a Scottish name is insulting"

Turns out that if you're halfway cool and don't act like a dick or cause problems, the people of Orange Mound generally won't just frivolously murder you. 

My house did get broken into once and some stuff got stolen, but afterwards one of my neighbors offered to help fix my door, and several others helped me look for my cat who had escaped in the break-in. Mostly fine people, just very poor.

"1. Start watching your diet and go to the gym. I never had to think about what I ate in my life and stayed fit just from work. Then I gained 30lbs in a year due to not adjusting.

2. Get up and away from your desk at least once an hour, even if only for a quick walk around the office. Staring at a screen all day without breaks is enough to drive one nuts.

3. Get your desk ergonomics setup pronto. Sitting has honestly been harder on my back than field work, and I had constant pain in my wrist until I got a special ergonomic mouse. Fix it before it becomes an issue.

4. Be prepared for conflicts and office politics. Unlike in the field where you can be mad at a coworker and then just blow off steam together through physical work, you won't have that luxury. So learn to communicate and work through issues with people directly. Understand that someone riding you all the time may not just be an asshole. They may just be going through an adjustment period because you have a different style than the person you're taking over from in that role and it's interrupting their work flow. Once again, talk it out and see what you can do to make things flow better between you.

5. Communicate. Communicate. Communicate. CC everyone you think may even remotely be involved. No easier way to offend career office workers than to leave them out of a dialogue. Don't hide anything from anyone, especially screwups. Own up to shit and work to fix issues in the open.

6. Find the person that keeps the gears greased and everything moving in the office and get on their good side. You can tell this person by the fact managers will come to them frequently with questions and rely on them to handle issues. This will usually be a woman, honestly, because women are just better at multitasking in general. I think every office has that one person where it feels like the place would burn to the ground if they weren't around to keep everything together. You want this person to like you as you will learn faster from them than any manager.

7. Two to three months in you're really going to start missing field work and you're probably going to hate the monotony of office life. Push through and it gets better. Find things to do to entertain yourself. Bring a Nerf gun if allowed. Engage in group projects outside your scope of work. Find friends in the office and make a point to spend time with them a few times a day. Just generally find reasons to want to come to work.

8. Enjoy all your newfound Reddit time, evenings and sleeping together with your significant other if applicable, and appreciate that you can now buy a fun car to drive to work instead of a truck!

Best of luck!

"It shouldn't be about race or any kind of affirmative action.

It *should* be about diversity of experience and outlook on life. I mean, a university's ability to educate their students suffers if all the students are the same. You lost the ability to stimulate debate and learning at the same level.

And this may be linked to race, but not intrinsically. I mean, you can have a lot of students who have high SAT scores, play concert piano or violin, volunteer in the same organizations after school, etc. They don't have to be Asian. But even if they're fucking purple, you don't want too many applicants with exactly the same set of extracurriculars from the same socioeconomic class and region.

Similarly, accepting some lower income students who have after school work experience from an inner city can seriously enrich the university experience even if their test scores weren't so high. Same with athletes, theater majors, writers for school papers, etc.

It's only when you focus on race alone as your metric that it suffers. You need to include *all* sources of diversity. Then I'm fine with it."
"Literally every aspect and thing you are asking about was fabricated.  0% of the show was 'real' and I would surmise that this is true of most other reality TV shows. 

The production company got in touch with ours via one of their talent scouts.  They asked if we would be interested in being on the show. About a year later, they approached us again with a script / concept for an episode.  We agreed to be a part of it thinking that we would gain some exposure for our business.  We shot the episode in about 12 hours and it aired a few months later. 

Our business was not impacted in a positive or negative way and virtually no one has said they've recognized us from the episode. 

e:  to answer your question more directly, all arguments, accidents, unforeseen challenges etc were all part of the original script for the segment. There is no bidding process what-so-ever. There were small opportunities for adlibbing and the actual labor/work that we did on camera was real.  The load was real but the story behind why the load needed to be transported was fake. "
"A lot of it is fake, though.  Like they ha e some contestants compete on multiple versions of ""Talent"" to boost ratings and the contestants careers.  The judges know they are plants but act like they are out of the blue surprises.

"Security guard in a hospital.

It was the smallest hospital in the area in a relatively small town, so not much happens, but we had a long term care unit.. essentially an old folks home on the top floor. It was my responsibility to escort the (I forget the proper name here) person who takes the deceased to the funeral home to the door. 

I only ever had to do this once mind you.

TL;DR - Saw a dead body for the first time. Expected to be really freaked out by death, was a very mundane experience.

He lifted back the sheet to confirm the identity for himself and I guess to say ""yep that guys dead"". I remember psyching myself out, getting freaked out because I had never seen a dead body before and every funeral I had ever been to i had never approached the casket. But honestly seeing a dead body for the first time in this context I just remember thinking, ""Huh. So that's it eh?"" I think it's because I had no emotional connection to this stranger and he was elderly."

Of course.  However it doesn't really matter.  The lip will be at most a couple of inches.  If we are generous and assume a 2 inch lip all around then that means that the height has to be within 4 inches of the side length in order to stop it from being able to be dropped.  The largest equilateral manhole cover that satisfies that condition has a side length of less than 2.5 ft.  Subtracting the four inches gives a usable hole side of 2ft 2 inches.  You will not be able to fit an adult down that hole.  Manhole sized triangular manhole covers can be dropped.

I say no.

And faster than I can say, ""You probably shouldn't do that"", he reaches up with a lighter and sets it on fire. 
He was right when he said it rained fire. Bits of plastic melted and fell down still alight. I have to admit it was kind of awesome.

And then the tree caught fire.

This was further compounded by Russell Brand, who was on Joe Rogan's podcast very recently who said the same thing about his time behind the celebrity curtain and that now he's kicked drugs and sex addictions that true happiness really comes from altruism.

"It depends on your goal of a relationship.  If you're looking to have a good time, then dating someone when you don't want to marry them is fine - as long as they're on the same page.  If you're looking to get married, then you're basically ""wasting time"" that could be finding and dating the person you'd marry.

"In CK2 you aren't playing a tactical military game as much as a diplomatic strategy where your military is one of your tools. You play as a dynasty; when your current ruler dies, you play as the heir. If your heir isn't of your dynasty, you lose. It's not too hard to avoid losing, but who wants to merely ""not lose"" when there are empires to conquer?

Feudal law is a big deal in CK2. You cannot declare war without *casus belli*: due legal cause for your war. This can be a legitimate claim on a county someone else holds... or a less legitimate, forged claim. It can be a holy war against someone of a differing religion. You can also declare war on behalf of a vassal's claim, so long as you can be certain they'll still call you liege after they have their own land.

War isn't the only option. Political marriages are a vital tool. So are assassins. You can marry off family members with the goal of bringing foreign claims into the dynasty, which you can later press in war... or see to it that a member of your dynasty becomes heir to the title you desire when the other heirs die of totally natural causes.

And that's just the growth aspect. Your leader matters a lot and you'll spend time grooming your heir into the kind of leader you'll want to play next. There is a research system you'll spend some time on, and building structures and fortifications within your demesne. Get big enough and you'll have factions within your land seeking to lower your authority, enforce their preferred inheritance laws, or simply install themselves in your place as leader. And it pays to remember that a sizeable chunk of your military strength comes from those vassals, so it pays to keep them happy... or dead, jailed, or otherwise removed works too, if you can accomplish it without irritating the other vassals.

It's a pretty unique game in many ways. Hope that gives you some insight into it. Really fun game if you're into the feudal political aspects of things."

"This is true of both 1963 and 2005 DW, imo.

Original Who got incredibly far up its own asshole in the mid-to-late 80s, refused to accept any innovations in production or direction, and generally decided to cater to a dwindling cult fanbase instead of bringing in new viewers. The very last season is actually decent, but the changes came far too late.

NuWho is slowly devolving from ""very soft sci-fi"" to ""straight-up space magic"" and I'm not sure how I feel about that. The show also feels less willing to take progressive(-ish) social stances than during the RTD era, which is disappointing.

I will say that all of the 2005 Doctors themselves have been pretty good and watchable. More than the others, Capaldi took a little while to find his groove, but he's a great actor, and his episodes are pretty amazing when he isn't mired in Stupid Moffat Plots."

This is way more common than it should be. There was a crazy old man in my aunts old neighborhood that got busted for killing/sickening a bunch of the neighborhood cats by leaving out cans of tuna laced with antifreeze. 
No is benis
The fact that everyone wants to blame someone or something other than themselves for there screw ups. 
"This is eerily similar to something that happened to me. When I was 10, a weird neighbour of mine had this old-ass cat that was always milling about the park. I was walking home from school one day and noticed it curled up under some bushes, so I go right ahead and jab it with a stick a few times and realise it's dead.

Being a dumb kid, I decided that it'd be better to pick it up and bring it to the neighbour instead of just telling my parents. Let me tell you, this lady flips out like nothing I'd ever seen or seen since. Starts screaming that I killed the cat and demanding I admit it. I freaked the fuck out and told my folks; they had a word with her but she'd lost it, she was so convinced I killed it.

For 10 miserable years I live across the street from this woman. Every time I see her she's whispering to other neighbours about me, giving me dirty looks. FINALLY, she moves out and it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Fast forward another two years, I'm out mowing the lawn and who do you think I see casually strolling up to me like it's the most normal thing in the World? Yup, insane cat lady. My jaw drops and I was genuinely frightened, just gawping at her as she makes her way up my drive. She puts her face within two inches of mine and growls ""admit it, admit you killed my cat"". 

I came pretty darn close to pissing myself, just muttered ""no, I really didn't"". She shakes her head, turns around and walks off. Happens once a year now, like clockwork. I'm not sure if I should get a restraining order at this point, I've got a kid on the way and I truly worry about what she's capable of. "

"Based on the condition of the house it would probably need to be taken down and rebuilt, it had issues besides their damage.

Specifically I remember the foundation had several cracks and the deck needed to be replaced but that wasn't damage from them leaving just from the house's age.

It did sell fast because we were driving though that part of town a couple days later and it had a sold sign already. I'm sure someone bought it, flipped it and made a nice profit but it was to much work for us.

At the time we were a few months from our wedding and I was working at a place that is 75 minutes from my house so though I had some time to fix stuff I didn't have the time to undertake such a large project.

We ended up buying a semi-detached and over a couple years redid the basement, built a garage, built a back patio and cleaned up/remodeled some of the rooms upstairs and sold for a decent profit ourselves. Now we have the house of our dreams and couldn't be happier."
This is my answer too. Although it wasn't till the second time I read it that I noticed all the homoerotic subtext.
Shoot. Is this something that's common for women? All of my exes have married the next girl they date after me. It frickin makes me not even want to date knowing that they won't be happy with me and will marry the next girl.

"I stayed over at a friends house for the first time when I was in high school, I woke up one morning to his dad using the elliptical in his basement, completely naked. I didn't know what to do so I just pretended to be asleep until he was done and got the fuck out of there. The next day at school I asked him what the fuck that was about, and he nonchalantly told me that his parents were nudists and that wasn't unusual. Needless to say, I never returned."

"That's pretty much what I do. Nursing beers isn't even necessarily a negative, but it's just something I feel compelled to do. I miss having freedom to partake in my drinks whenever I please.

I also wish I could enjoy getting smashed with my friends in a pub. It's something I've always wanted to do, but I'm much too paranoid to even consider it. Where I come from, you can't get a taxi...

"Linguist here. You're mostly correct!

It's not quite right to say that being isolated halts the evolution of a language. Any language being spoken (even not spoken in some cases; Neo-Latin, I'm looking at you) is evolving, however, the evolution is separate and unique from its source. The evolution diverges, so whereas in England the past participle of get has become got, the get of American speech has not undergone a similar change. It doesn't, however, mean that the English spoken in America is any more or less correct.

Historical Linguists can pinpoint mergers and splits in phonemic inventories of languages by comparing different dialects' inventories to see if changes were present by the time of the migration of speakers! It is all very cool!"

"Working in a video rental shop,

This was an age ago, long before your new fangled DVD and Blu-Ray discs even existed.

This was a good old fashioned VHS video shop where you could rent out films for 1-3 days at a time.

It even had a literal 'top shelf' for adult material.

The shop had several portable VHS players and as I didn't have one at home at the time, I got to borrow one over the weekends and take home as many films as I wanted (excluding premium titles).

A few fun facts for you, at the time I worked there, brand new VHS releases cost about £60-80.

Video rentals started from 50p per night.

During my time working there, Back to the Future was the most popular film in stock. There were 8 copies and almost every one was rented out each weekend.

According to the accounts, each copy of that film had earned the shop owner over £1,500.00 (which was a lot back in those days)"

I'd take your mother's word on this. She knew enough to not interfere sounds like, and maybe your brother wanted to make sure that, at least your memories of him were only positive and he was looking out for you too.

What I like to say about the past is, when you look back, if it's a good experience, smile and carry it with you at least for the day. If it's bad, don't stare at it too long, it'll ruin at least that day.

Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right.

In recent memory it's mainly been locals that have been attacked.

(or at least, their friends/families were.). A guy who got attacked while kite-surfing said he'd be right back out there as soon as he could. 

Though the local politicians always jump on the chance to talk about how the croc population is uncontrolled and that we need to institute cullings or crocodile 'safaris' (trophy hunting).

"I think the problem is that people 'witch hunt' over the *predilection* and not the act, and that is an issue in our society. But there still isn't an easy answer to this.      
 

That is part of the reason in 'the biz' (social services, the police, healthcare) the term 'child sex offender' is used and not 'pedophile'. Four main reasons:    
1) The term is unfortunate in that it vaguely translates to 'loves children' (the same way an 'anglophile' loves things English). This plays into a very old idea that abusers use that somehow abuse comes from a place of love, to mess with children's heads in order to keep them from disclosing to others.        
2) We need to separate it from the act. The act is the problem - children being abused. Its not about the person's thoughts, its about the kids - they are the victims and the reason this is a crime.     
3) A large proportion of child sex offenders *are not pedophiles*, in the sense that they are not primarily sexually attracted to children. Instead its about power, in a similar way to the rape of adults.               
4) People will argue that they're not 'like a pedophile' because the people they're attracted to are pubescent and that somehow makes it OK. It's isn't 'sick like fancying babies' and normalise it. It doesn't matter what the person is attracted to in that sense - again, if children are abused it matters that children are being abused, rather than the abuser's specific sexual interest.


Really, I think the problem is that we aren't pragmatic and we let 'They fancy children! Sick bastards!' overtake 'We need to protect actual children'. Personally I don't really give a shit what is in someone's head - if you are 'that way' I imagine it must be hard, and I think we need to come up with some solution for anyone who identifies these feelings and doesn't act on them. But from the perspective of safeguarding children, it means nothing.

From me experience in the area, there is a massive reluctance to address the possibility of those who self identify an uncontrollable urge to abuse children for three reasons:    
1) People who protect children, support child and adult survivors, are very wary of a resurgence in groups who normalise child sex abuse - until incredibly recently there were official groups who tried to campaign for acceptance in people who had sex with children (not people who wanted to, people who *did*). Up until very recently, even now, there isn't enough focus on children and the actual children being harmed were ignored (see the Saville and Westminster cases in the UK for striking evidence of this). Many professionals feel that focussing on non-offending pedophiles is in conflict with a need to increasingly focus on children, all children.     
2) We don't really have anything that works. We're talking about therapy either to 'cure' people or stop them from offending. Unfortunately, such a therapy doesn't really exist. There are toolkits you can give people which help them control their behaviour, the same as we already use for various types of unwanted behaviour, but they're not perfect and we don't really have much evidence they help in this area. I mean, I think we should go for it in at least trying, but we shouldn't pretend we know what we're doing here.     
3) As other people are saying, ""Sorry we can't arrest you unless you touch a child"" is important - if someone has not committed a sex offence, they are not a sex offender, and therefore sanctions cannot be put in place. Same with any 'I cannot control my behaviour and feel I am at risk of committing a crime' - that is a medical issue, not a criminal one. 


TLDR; this shit is *really* fucking complicated, and no one really knows what to do about it."

We were instructed to use it 'sparingly' but 'when really necessary'. Part of the reason I left, but a good lesson to learn, I'm always polite but firm with cold callers now."

It's the hiding and the self-loathing that comes from growing up in a homophobic environment that messes up a lot of people.

"My brother is a mid-high functioning autistic and while I lived with them (few days) she constantly screamed at him. His ADHD focuses on videogames so while he would game after working for 14 hrs she would be in his ear yelling about every 5 minutes. She never once tried to treat him like a person with a mental handicap. One thing is, he simply can't wash dishes. He just can't. Nothing on this planet helped my sweet mother trying to get him to correctly do dishes and  much less a woman throwing the dirty ones at him. 

She also got him kicked out of a job he had held for 4 years (first time EVER he's held a job for more than 3 month's) by lying to his manager (she used to work there too) about his shifts and conduct etc.

This lovely sister in law also seized ALL of the meager wages he made to ""keep an eye on their finances"". This morphed into her refusing to give him money so he could pay his ex-wife's child support which caused the court 4 states away  to summon him. He doesn't have a car or money so that was even more financial shit on him. 

His ""wife"" would also leave her child from another man with him for days at a time while she hung out at her friend's house and slept over there constantly. Very frequently her friend would stay the night and my brother had to sleep on the floor while her and her friend used the master. 

He's a hard-working guy who accepts everyone for who they are, as is. His heart is unimaginably kind and not in a million years would that girl deserve someone like him. 

She was also on drugs and when my mom flew in from cross-country to confront her about it (take this drug test or get away from my son) she called her a ""bitch"" and forced my brother to move to NY with job prospects which of course didn't exist once they got there. 

Stole his car, stole his money, manipulated him. The works. "

"Had a seizure in rehab when they took me off benzos.  Second seizure in a week in the place, so I think they were tapering us off benzos too quickly.  They used librium to ween me off and I wasn't feeling right but still going through all the work and making the meetings that they mandated, but I felt really uncomfortable in a morning meeting and when it ended I dashed out to smoke a cigarette.  That's when I fell down seizing. 

I was told I was caught by the other patients.  There's surprisingly little they do for you for a seizure.  The ambulance basically ditched me in an emergency room, which is where I came to.  I was just sitting in a wheelchair in the emergency room.  This is where I immediately found somebody with painkillers and bought as many as I could (addict behavior sup).   The hospital took hours to even get me looked at, gave me some IV Ativan, and released me a few hours later.   I was next to a screaming lady who broke her hip.  She knew it was like a death sentence for people her age, and acted like it.   My head was pounding and all my muscles hurt.    

When I got back to the rehab, they immediately drug tested me, because I had left the premises.  I told the hospital not to release any of my information.  I said I took what the hospital gave me and checked myself out AMA the next day.  They didn't want me there anyway because seizures are huge liabilities.  I had it outside smoking a cigarette where patients weren't supposed to be (by NY State law) but where we were allowed and security was out with us.   

I got better afterwards, I had done 14 days in the rehab and I got what I needed from it.   The hospital stay was mostly just boring, except for the screaming, which was headache inducing when my brain already felt like it was ringing.  "

To make a very long story short, I ran out of my apartment with the door still open, cats got out, things were stolen. While I was out of my apartment in this state I took my shirt off (I'm female) and proceeded to jump on someone's parked car. Police were called. I was taken to the hospital and I woke up there with absolutely no recollection of how I got there. When I asked the nurse if I could go and what had happened she asked me in a very annoyed voice... ""Are you done meowing at us?""... And I was released after a while. I will never ever take psychedelics ever again. 

Also just so y'all know my cats came back eventually and yes I am a cat lady but holy hell was that a fucking trip. And an expensive one too."

"Yeah my father was a middle-high level exec for a financial services division of a massive national insurance corporation, and they made the decision (in secret) to shut down the division. They coordinated the shutdown across the entire country (hundreds of offices, thousands of employees) at the same time; 8:00 am on a monday. They had police and private security at *all* offices making sure everyone quickly and peacefully cleaned out their personal effects by 9:00 am. The execs (my father included) were told together at an ""unrelated"" conference by the main corporate execs while all of the ""regular"" employees were robo-called or told when they showed up at 8:00 for work. 

He obviously wasn't happy about the situation, but he said that he absolutely understood why they did it and that it was pretty impressive how they coordinated it so perfectly. "

"'Going Dutch' is a slang term for everyone paying their own way.  The likely origination of the term came from the rivalry between the English and the Dutch during the Anglo-Dutch wars (1650-1800).  The English came up with a bunch of things they considered offensive and slapped them with terms referencing the Dutch.

'Going Dutch' was considered rude to guests as the host was supposed to pay.  'Dutch Courage' is courage gained from intoxication.  'Dutch Metal' is imitation gold leaf.  'A 'Dutch Concert' is multiple people singing different songs or just a cacophony in general.  A 'Dutch auction' is an auction where the price starts high and goes lower until someone is willing to buy it.

'Going Dutch' is much more common than it used to be, but it has deep roots in being considered rude."

Article 377 of the Indian penal code illegalises any form of sex which is 'against the law of nature' (or something like that, I don't remember word by word). This includes oral and anal sex, and anything else except penile-vaginal sex. 

And considering that homosexual methods of sex aren't penile-vaginal sex, it's considered illegal. 

It is not illegal to be gay (otherwise a bunch of people would have gotten arrested for being gay), but it is illegal to have gay sex  

What baffles me is that this also restricts straight couples from exploring in their sex life, which is wrong. So I don't get why only the LGBT community complain about this law, when every person should be against this. "

Perhaps the soldiers assumed that Hitler was more likely to have shot himself rather than use cyanide, but in reality it was the other way around. Maybe at some point the Russians just forgot which was which and made an assumption.

About 6 years ago when I was a sophomore in college, I used to go on late night drives with a buddy of mine, Carter. He'd call me at around 11pm, we'd jump in his roommate's truck, pick a highway and drive away from the city until we felt like going home. Some nights we wouldn't get back until 4am. 

One night we were heading north on Hwy 75. Somewhere between Prosper and Gunter, TX, we turn down this little two lane asphalt road lined with trees and scrubby underbrush, leading into farmland dotted by small houses. It's around 1am at this point and it's dark as hell. We're far enough from the city and there wasn't much of a moon, if at all. 

There in the dark, I noticed this broken down school bus in one of the fields just off the road and pointed it out to Carter. We made some jokes about ghost children and crazed chainsaw murderers, of course because who wouldn't? 

We drive through the dark a little further when the headlights catch a big teddy bear in the middle of the road. Carter maneuvered around it, but then there was another, and another. Suddenly, all over this tiny road surrounded by nothing but trees, dirt, and a haunted school bus, is a fuck ton of cute fluffy teddy bears of all different types and sizes. This scares the bajeezus out of us-- I was sure they were ghost children in disguise-- and I'm yelling at Carter to not hit the bears. Evidently, his instinct is the same (""I'm trying!"") because he's swerving the truck left and right, trying his best to dodge them. Without a doubt, we ran over a few. There were just so many! 

Neither of us is haunted by children or teddy bears due to this incident. At least as far as I know. "

"This isn't the reason for the format change. The public vote format just turned out to be extremely boring for Americans. Back in those early days, people on reality TV worried about being seen as ""nice"". (Don't believe me? On season 1 of Survivor, being in an alliance was seen as a bad thing.) The more controversial and entertaining houseguests were voted out very early. Also, the HGs manipulated the votes to have many-way ties, rather than giving the public only two choices which is supposed to happen. There was no strategy to speak of. 

Turns out Americans prefer a more strategic and cutthroat game. Glass House tried the public vote format again a few years ago and it flopped just as hard. (However, that house was absolutely beautiful, and ""fanswers"" is a concept Big Brother should absolutely steal. But they'd better not let any houseguests ask inconsequential questions like ""did you smile today"".)"
"I had a kid bring his mom along to his interview for a pizza delivery position.  The mom answered all of the questions and asked a few of her own while the kid sat there like he was just along for the ride.  Of course I didn't hire him, but another manager did. OK, whatever.  So the kid spends his first two shifts riding along with an experienced driver.  He wasn't very enthusiastic, but he wasn't rude, etc...

On his third shift we sent him out on his own with two orders headed for the same neighborhood.  Kid's gone for an hour - the customers call and want to know why their pizzas haven't shown up.  Kitchen remakes the orders and sends them out, gratis because the customers had to wait so long.  Still no word from the kid.

Finally, later that evening, his mom calls and tells us her son is quitting because 'everyone was mean to him'.  Apparently he got lost and instead of returning to the store, he went home - with the pizzas - and gave his mom a song and dance about how everyone at the store was a total asshole."

The firing mechanisms that define modern pistols and assault rifles were invented by that guy. Neither would exist as we know them without Browning's work.

Then there's pump action shotguns. And the Winchester 73', Gun that won the west. The BAR which the US refused to use in WWI because we were terrified of the Germans reverse engineering them. Instead our troops got far inferior French rifles.

A lot of his designs were only retired because of improved material science, IE plastics, necessitated weapons Browning could have never dreamed of."

"From what I've gathered, dogs aren't trained to just sense seizures. They have to be trained with one specific person from the very beginning so they can grow familiar with the signs of the beginning of a seizure (well before the seizure happens). Every person's different so the dog has to learn what that person's signs are. Once they see the signs they can signal the person (like lick their hand) to let them know a seizure is about to happen. It gives the person enough time to lay on the floor so they can prevent physical injuries."

"My mother is a doctor that specializes in elderly end of life care (hospice), so it is expected that every patient she gets will die. They are all aware of their imminent death and spent their last days reflecting on their life, from their proudest moments to their deepest regrets, and trying to make peace with whatever unresolved conflicts they still have. She sees about 2-4 individuals pass away every month. These are all people who had the opportunity to live out a long life to an advanced age.
    
The thing that really affected my mom and in turn affected how she raised me is the one regret that all her patients have in common: they all wished they spent more time with the people they loved and doing what they loved. Meaning, they wish they hadn't spent that extra time in the office at a shitty job to get the extra money they actually didn't need, wasted their time trying to please other people they actually didn't like, and wished they could've faced their ego or guilt earlier when pushing away someone they actually care about. Most of her patients are surrounded by family and loved ones... but some die alone, unfortunately by their own accord.
    
Money and achievement have an eventual expiration date but love for what/who you love is the only thing that has lasting value when everything else (including yourself) is gone. All those last testaments my mom has experienced has lead her (and to me) to ask ""Will this be something I will be happy with when I die?"" when faced with any kind of important or even semi-important decision."
"Hey, I can actually speak to this one!  It happened in my city and I have a working knowledge of use of force/Canadian law.

Short version is this: They tried to make a lawful arrest (though I can't speak to store policy with regards to following someone into the parking lot).  Guy resisted, they used reasonable force, guy pulled a knife and they upped the use of force.  A knife represents a threat of death/grievous bodily harm.

Watch the video, at 20 seconds the fucker actually stabs the guy in black twice.  Once that happens you're pretty much cleared to use any level of force.  So the people who are saying talking about lawsuits or claiming ""you can't just lay a beatdown on someone like that"" well..... you can after the guy has stabbed you.

"My freshman year in college I wanted to hook up with the girl down the hall. She had 2 roommates

After a night of partying they said ""let's go watch jersey shore"". So we posted up in my dorm room and turned on the tv, the girls ran to their room to get pajamas on and some pizza bites 

After a few minutes they all come back to my room and we start hanging out. There wasn't much space in my room for people, so the girl I liked said ""hey *jamie* hop up and sit at the foot of *sheetshitters* bed""

jamie sat on my bed and I was confused, I had tried my best to make the girl I liked, *summer* to be closest to me, not Jamie. Jamie continues to sit on my bed and then after 15 minutes of watching jersey shore and eating snacks. Jamie lays down over the covers next to me (I was under the covers) 

Shit, this is not what I planned...

Then outta no where summer and the other girl say ""okay we're tired, goodnight"" and they quickly get up and exit the room. Now it's just me and Jamie in my bed

""Fuck"" I say to myself 

Jamie rolls over and immediately starts making out with me. Jamie is like 4 foot 10 inches of horny Asian fury. Tongue all destroying my mollers and grabbing my face. She stops and looks into my soul, ""take my clothes off"" I stare at her blankly and follow directions 

This is not the girl I was supposed to be fucking but I guess I'll go along with it.... 

Unsure of myself I start to undress her, she undresses me, ""I love your cock"" she says to me, being  dirty talk virgin... I'm sort of taken back. ""Thanks"" I said insuringly 

Now... Before we get any further in this. I DONT have an enormous cock, it might be like... Maybe a little more than average, but I don't think so. 

""Oh it's so big!"" She says and she starts beating my meat. 

Seconds later I'm inside her, she's on top and I'm basically along for the ride 

It was pretty standard stuff but she kept saying awkward shit to me and worst of all, her vagina was not large enough for my penis. She's wailing noises of pain/pleasure and I'm not sure which it is. But every time she came down on my dick I hit the roof of her vaginal cavity, I could literally feel my dick bending with every drop of that ass to my balls.

Snap, snap, snap, it was really painful. So painful in fact that I lost my erection and we had to stop. She asked what she could do so I asked for a blowjob, then she started to cry.

Idk what I did but shit got weird after that and she left

I later busted my nut into a paper towel.

B.  Taking guns away from known violent offenders and those with certain mental illnesses may reduce their risks to themselves and others.

C.  While this will not stop everything, it might curb some of the rampant gun violence in America.  

The reality is that gun-control is a blanket term and used in such a way that there is no intelligent discourse about it, everything is spoken of in absolutes when this is a complex issue.  

For instance, if you poll Americans asking if they support background checks for gun purchases, you'll get a number, usually from 85-90% that say yes. (1)  If you change the question a bit, and ask whether protecting gun rights or controlling gun ownership is more important, you'll get an answer of 52% for protecting gun rights and 46% for controlling gun ownership. (2) Those questions are not exactly the same, mind you, but it does go a ways toward showing how important wording is.

The whole point of the show is so the judges can blindly judge you on your voice alone and she didn't make it to them for reasons other than her voice. It irritates me so much I stopped watching the show."

"I've worked at a tutoring center for 8 years, currently employed at a university as a graduate teaching assistant. I've worked with some really amazing individuals, some of which were loved by the students, hated by fellow teachers, and vice versa. 

At the tutoring center, we had one employee who was an absolute monster towards the students. And us. It didn't help that she was bipolar, and would suddenly go from a sweet pea to a rotten carrot in a matter of moments. A student coughed too loudly? Student is asked to leave the room and parents called immediately. Student didn't do the homework correctly, 100% the way she wanted (ie. ONE cursive letter is wrong)? Student is verbally chastised in front of the room as well as in the front of the entire tutoring center. Talk about layers of mental and psychological abuse. Children and employees were driven to tears by her. Multiple times. Multiple. This individual was a monster, and she abused everyone. Even her son. And her husband. 

All the tutors knew it. We told our boss. The boss did nothing. Employees quit. Boss did nothing. Families left the center. Boss made excuses. Employees banded together, nearly protesting. No avail. 

This went on for years until this individual was asked to leave after a verbal altercation while we were open and assisting with kids. 

Moral of the story: If the teacher is a bitch to the students, they will be a bitch to their fellow teachers. Treat your students the same way you would treat a fellow human being; we are all humans, learning together in this shared space. "

"Well.....I mean, yeah, you think that.....because you also have a kid. If you don't have a child, why would you want to deal with all the shit parts of parenting with little of the fun stuff?

Dating someone with a kid means you have to be okay with being, at BEST, number 2 in their life. And it's usually more like 4 or 5 because you'll come behind the kids (reasonable!), and probably their own mom or dad or whoever it is who helps them take care of their kids, and a lot of the time, themselves, because they're still wary from being hurt by their ex and made a single parent. A lot of people aren't up for that; they want their partners to be their number one. Then of course you have to deal with all the drawbacks of parenthood like scheduling dates around the kids, and having to be cool if your partner needs to cancel at the last minute, and dropping plans to go pick them up, with none of the perks (i.e.; most sane single parents aren't going to let a newish partner get close to the kids for a long time because they need to protect their children's feelings). Then, you often have baby daddy/mommy drama thrown into the mix as well.

Sorry, while you yourself may be fine with that, you can't honestly say you *dont understand* how anyone would want to avoid that?"

One thing I learned was that if there was ever a section that looked doubtful, the best thing to do was to cross it out and initial it.  A thing to look for is any terms that seem to enforce hardship on you, but no symmetrical requirement for the other party of the contract.

3. Caviar -- high end restaurant, try some for as an appetizer. Learn to enjoy bitter and salty flavors and your palate will open up. 

4. Wines -- dry or sweet, red or white, earthy or fruity, learn to tell the difference. Price isn't a strong indicator of quality. Vineyard is. 

5. Sushi -- never order from the menu. Sit at the bar and chat up the chefs. Have them make their specialities and whatever is fresh. 

6. Cheese -- go to a cheese monger and try try try. Pair with wines!

7. Charcuterie -- know the difference between your wursts and salame. Order bresaola and impress your friends. also goes well with wines. 

8. Properly-cooked steaks by type. If you must eat a filet, medium rare. Never cook a ribeye more than rare. Get all your strips black and blue. The hanger steak is the best cut there is in the hands of a competent cook. Medium rare is delicious, but black and blue done right is even better. Pair with frites rather than a baked potato. 

9. Game meats -- elk, venison, quail, etc., are all must tries. Don't be afraid of boar or kangaroo. 

10. Coffees and teas -- go to a real shop and talk to the owners. Try samples. "

Briefly.
"I'm a property manager (I manage single family homes). The laws about service animals are starting to tighten up, thankfully. Until last month in my state, if someone said it was a service animal, you had to treat it as such. You couldn't ask for proof that it was a service animal, because that would require the person to disclose their disability, and that was a slippery slope due to FHA rules. (Fair Housing; can't discriminate against protected groups, one of which is disabled persons.) I had a potential tenant claim a very large boa as a service animal. I've had to let a woman with two service dogs into a rental that the owner didn't want animals in, as she is very allergic and planned on moving back in at some point. I've had someone claim service animals, then bred them for sale throughout their tenancy, in another home the owner did not want animals in. I'm pretty sure none of these dogs were anything more than pets (or income). I'm glad the laws are changing and I'll be able to ask for proof without violating FHA rules. "

A year after I graduated elementary school, we were told he died of cancer and I regret that I never gave him anything, even little. He was a good man who always did his best to make us children happy. I know he probably thought that was payment enough, but it would be nice to go back and give him something."

"A girl climbs into a dumpster and takes off all her clothes. Then she takes a rotten, maggot infested, price of meat and puts it into her vagina. She orgasms and puts her clothes back on (without removing the maggots) and goes home. At home she lays on her bed and enjoys feeling the maggots inside her. She has to use the restroom but doesn't want to get up, she she pisses and shits in her bed, then smears the shit all over herself. After 2 days of this, she takes a mirror and looks at her vagina. It is covered with maggots and black and purple where the tissue is dying. She goes to the hospital. The end."

"So the house I grew up in was in an average suburban cul-de-sac, lots of family's with kids all ages. We were a pretty close knit group, lots of block parties, everyone knew everything kinda deal; however there was one couple that just avoided everyone. They were older, probably late 70's early 80's and were complete shut ins, which was odd but that wasn't thier issue. Thier issue was they are INSANE. They were incredibly paranoid about thier lawn so they did the logical thing and set up cameras so they could watch it. They watched these cameras all day everyday; the kids on the block loved to play street hockey, god forbid a puck went into thier yard or else all hell would break loose. The wife would run out and chase the kids away and take the puck into thier house, within 5 minutes the police were there cause the old fucks called them for ""defacing property"" This happened weekly. They openly spied on people, they would take pictures from thier windows when people walked near thier house, they would drive around slowly, following kids on thier bikes taking pictures of them. Did I mention they were my next door neighbours? They had cameras facing into my backyard, to make sure I never jumped the fence or something? They got my friends mom arrested cause they got in an argument and of course called the cops, she was quickly released when it was realized what was happening but she spent a night in jail. To top it all of they stole my fucking cat. Over the years every family moved away to get away from them, they killed that neighborhood.

At the tender age of 8 or so I had the chore of cleaning the ring around the bathtub. It wasn't coming off, so I asked what I should do.

""Just use some elbow grease.""

So off I went to the laundry cupboards, systematically getting out all of the cleaning products. I think my mother heard me opening and shutting cupboard doors, because she appeared in the doorway and asked why I had all the bottles on the floor.

""I'm looking for the elbow grease.""

Watching her face go from anger (thinking I was messing with her) to puzzlement, to amusement when she realised I had never heard the phrase before was quite something.

"When my husband was a resident, one of his older professors went on a rant about how entitled residents are now. ""When he was in med school, he could afford a nice car and apartment, and had plenty of time to study, why can't you guys?""

It's because now, med school costs $500,000 and they're paid basically nothing compared to the amount they work. They're capped at 80 hours a week, only because the hospitals aren't allowed to keep them longer, and I think my husband was getting about $2000 a month in pay. That's just a little over $6/hr. In the 60s, you could buy a decent house for $60k, now, you can't even get a shit house for that. 

Edit to add- now that I'm thinking about it, I think the new law capping residen's hours at 80 hours a week was what prompted the rant. That they're all just lazy assholes, because ""back in my day, we actually worked hard"". I think -don't quote me on this-  they must leave the hospital upon working 80 hours, or at 36 hours in a row, but can come back after a break until they reach 80 hours.  36 hours, without so much as a nap or maybe even a snack, taking care of your grandma in the icu, and this asshole is throwing a fit about it.

* Nic Cage pushed for and executive produced the (really shitty) SciFi Channel version of the Harry Dresden stories

But for a while before the whole ""I may actually end up killed from this"" thought entered her head, she was actually considering going and getting intentionally raped by putting herself in all kinds of risky situations until it happened."

Does he say nothing and pray the feelings fade? It is not an easy situation and I feel bad for all parties involved but him most of all. Why? Well because the fiancé and friend don't even know.. They aren't hurting or suffering right now.. Just he is.. All alone, with only an uber driver to confide in. Ignorance is bliss.

"I think there should be *some level* of regulation when it comes to having kids. Simple, easy, base-layer of regulation, comparable to that of driver's licenses. Don't want kids and can't afford birth control? Sliding-scale cost birth control, no questions asked. It's less costly than welfare. Want kids? Study and take a test on pregnancy and babies. If you pass, you babysit an infant for a day. Baby survives? Rad, here's a special stamp/marker on your ID. Have a baby without these things? Some minor but absolutely obnoxious penalty. Like having to walk on a trail of legos or some shit. Fail the first test? You get offered birth control on a sliding scale, and a re-test date. Guys who want to be fathers need to take tests too, obviously. 

A lot of people think regulating reproduction is inherently racist and classist. I'd have to disagree. Simply make the process accessible to everyone, regardless of race or class, and use penalties that don't target by race or class (example: monetary fines unfairly penalize those with no/little money, so avoid those). It's not that hard. "

"This isn't quite right. In The Old Testament, Moses was actually fairly permissive when it came to divorce (Deuteronomy 24:1-4); contrastingly, divorce was forbidden by Jesus in the New Testament except in cases of infidelity (Matthew 19:8). Sex before marriage is also pretty heavily implied to be wrong in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 7). 

As for eating meat you're pretty much right. Romans 14 (New Testament) says it's basically up to you whether you consider certain foods unclean and you're only sinning if you eat something that you believe is unclean.

"The last cruise I went on, the hot tub was constantly filled with seniors, until late at night, maybe an hour or so before the hot tubs closed.  I got in a hot tub with a group of seniors on the first day. They each told me what ailment they were working on and asked what I was using the hot tub for. Then one of the women (who had back surgery a few days prior to the cruise) tried to get out. She could not get out of the hot tub, and I was putting serious effort in trying to help her out. I had to go get cruise staff to help, because I couldn't lift her out myself. I realized getting into the hot tub was a trap - everyone needed help getting out, and they were just waiting for some sucker to climb in with them. "

"You are wrong. The idea of the Father ideal as ""Alpha Male"" is heinous bullshit designed to help insecure pricks feed their egos. The role of a father is to be supportive of the family and to protect them, NOT to dominate them through violence. A father should be a rock, should be a constant force of comfort and security to his kids. A father can't do that if he knocks his kids around every time he loses control of his emotions. A father who hits his kids isn't showing dominance, he's showing that he's got the emotional maturity of a toddler. 

PS: when my dad gave me an ""ass beating"", it didn't help me avoid ass beatings from random strangers, it made me a shy kid distrustful of authority figures--in other words, an easy target for bullies. The people who taught me to avoid ass beatings were martial arts instructors who could show discipline and strength without being ""alpha males"" and inspired trust by teaching through example. Now I can resolve conflicts without violence 99.9% of the time, and finish fights quickly and cleanly when I'm forced to fight. Being a man is about controlling yourself, not about controlling others. Beating up kids is pathetic and weak."

The problem is that this gentleman apparently doesn't have good social skills, which are very important for an RA. But honestly, I kinda wish my RAs had more similar to some of the guys I was in Scouts with, rather than the jock douches that they were. We could have had some fun hall events or whatever."

"Well, I guess the sound track to my lost virginity was pretty bad. It started at the end of an Indiana Jones movie, and once it ended it went back to the menu where it played part of the theme song on repeat. By then we were already getting down with the dirty so it was too late to turn it off. I lost my v card with the Indiana Jones theme blaring in the background."

"On the flip side of that, just because someone considers themselves an erudite that doesn't mean they can talk shit when someone doesn't know something.

But if in the next breath they're discussing sailing (which I know nothing about) and they're using vernacular I'm unfamiliar with, I expect them to handle the exchange with some grace, not ""You seriously don't know the difference between x and y?

"Maybe not the worst, but this one always stuck with me. I had this girlfriend who bugged me for *weeks* about what I wanted for my bday. It quickly went from cute to obnoxious.

“What do you want?????”

“I really don’t care. Why don’t we just go out for dinner?”

“NoooOOOoo! I have to *get* you something and it has to be *special*!”

“OK, well…um….I’m into video games? Here are some ideas?”

“Ugh—no! I’m not getting you a stupid video game!”

“OK sorry. Sorry…it’s just you asked so….uhhh…here’s a list of…books I’m interested in--”

“UGH—NO! I can’t just get you a THING that you’re already planning on getting yourself”

“Oh OK sorry. Yeah, I see what you’re saying. Something that I *want* but not like a *specific* thing I want. OK gotcha. Hey! I need new clothes! I could use a new shirt or some new shorts or really *anything* you think would look nice! Doesn’t have to be shirts or shorts! We can always just take it back if it doesn’t fit--”

“Hmmm…noooo….that’s…it’s just not *special* enough. Like everyone wears clothes, so it’s not something personal to you..”

“(OK but earlier I gave you things I would be personally interested in and you said—you know what forget it—not worth it)…Well, I have an idea! I try to get things for people that they’d *like* but that they usually wouldn’t go out of their way to buy themselves. Like I think cologne is a cool gift for a guy. Every guy would want to smell nice, but not every guy gets excited about it enough to like…buy nice cologne for himself ya know?”

“Yeah….noooooo… Hmmm…I don’t like that idea either. I’m going to ask your brother for ideas”

*Asks my brother and gets the same responses*

“Hmmm…that didn’t help…OH! OH! I know what I’m going to get you! You’re going to love it! It’s such a good idea! I thought of it all by myself!”

*Week later*

“I just got your gift today! You better like it! I spent a TON of time and money on it!”

So my birthday comes around and she got my a small pocket knife with my initials engraved on it—looked like it was from Things Remembered. If she had just gotten that to begin with, I probably would have been like “Oh cool! Neat babe! Thanks!” even though I already had a nice Leathermen I carried. I mean—it’s not a bad gift—good idea! But why make such a *huge deal* about it if you were just going to get something out of left field that *you* thought sounded cool?

That is *completely* the wrong way to do it.
My girlfriend and a few of our mutual friends were hanging at my place after just having spent a great day at the Ren Faire.

"We got a lot of driving laws right. But we got a lot wrong too.

I honestly think Europe and NA should sit down and nitpick all the driving laws. Pick the best of both and make it international law.

Most of our signs make more sense too. In fact, navigating an interstate is easy as fuck with both mile markers, exits based on those mile markers, and lane signs.

But Europe traffic lights are way better than ours, at least in Germany (Germany is my only real experience with Europe)."

"Spoken like someone who has never been in an accident. Used to drive me nuts when my friends would say stuff like this. ""If a car rear-ends you, it's always their fault. So if they're tailgating, slam on the brakes to teach them a lesson"". 

Only lesson that gets taught is how much of your time got wasted, waiting for the police, exchanging info, talking to the insurance etc. and then, when they don't have insurance, are illegal, or their insurance coverage isn't enough to cover the damages, a waste of your money. And then you have to spend time getting your car repaired. And even the most minor accidents often lead to some whiplash.

"The problem with not caring about assimilation is that it's not uncommon in some cultures for parents to sell their children.  Be it for dowry's of Frito's and soda or for reasons of virtue it's not something our laws and culture tolerate.  There are cultures where men and women do not mix and where woman and girls are properties rather than people but that doesn't go over well here or in a lot of developed places.  There are cultures that commonly eat animals we routinely keep as domestic pets and some of those animals are illegal to eat.  There are cultures that follow caste systems and I would not be comfortable going out in public in the US if I knew I could walk across a persons shadow then get the living hell beaten out of me for it because I'm in a lower caste to them although I don't subscribe to that persons culture in my country.  The cultures of the US must follow our laws or it can't work.  It's asinine to assume we should allow all cultures their ways in our country.

"I felt that something which was missing from the debates prior to the Referendum was a set of clear principles which backed up the rhetoric coming from both sides. I still think Leave was the right course of action based on three key arguments which I would like to think, are backed up by some solid principles;

Immigration - There's a strong case to be made that in some areas of the UK have an integration problem more than an immigration problem. There's a good case to be made that the lack of integration into UK society could have a lasting negative impact on the nation.
Morality - Having a modicum of control over the government is the only way for the public to keep any semblance of control over those in power. The consolidation of that power in such a remote, bureaucratic entity makes it nearly impossible for the public to take control.
Economics - To be fair, both sides of the argument did a poor job of making the economic case. The debate seemed to be between biased experts, questionable pundits and untrustworthy politicians; all of which we need to learn to avoid.

Speaking to friends and family about the principles behind these points, rather than repeating the political rhetoric they've been bombarded with to date, has really helped a few of them feel more comfortable with their decision to vote Leave.

"I have to correct you. The mass dying of native Americans when Europeans arrived was unwanted by both parties. The Europeans wanted much more to enslave the natives than kill them, however their existence wasn't compatible with the natives. Native Americans never had large livestock animals which caused a lot of disease in Europe. Because they had no immunity to the European diseases they died from them. 

There were never any recorded instances in modern day America of natives being given small pox blankets which is claimed so often, it did happen once though in Modern Canada. In fact throughout the continent there were never more than three or four concentrated efforts to kill off native Americans in a particular area. And even these were probably caused by native attacks on settlers in the midwest. It's a complicated affair, and it certainly wasn't a good thing, but to call it a genocide is a devaluation of the word.

"The quote:
""The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

"Maybe not really on topic (I forget what the topic actually is) but I grew up on Southern California. I had friends from Mexico, Pakistan, iran, India, and all other sorts of places. 'minorities' were everywhere, and I was cool with that. 

Then i moved to Maine. Not the part of Maine thats filled with black muslims, but the part that had 1 black kid in our high school.

The difference in the way people thought about anyone not a white christian there in maine compared to in southern california was absolutely astonishing. Like, I truly cant believe people are so racist or bigoted here. And its not like they want to be, theres just no exposure to anything else, so the only time they hear of a muslim is when theres a terrorist attack - the only time theyre exposed to minorities are when people are talking about crimes. 

Its awful, but I can totally see why theyre bigoted and its almost not even their fault. People say the media cant make you racist - I entirely disagree"

I look at Leonardo DiCaprio in roles like the departed or Django and see starkly different characters who are brought to life, forgetting about the actor playing them. I look at Denzel Washington in films like training day or man on fire and feel like the characters are real, with all of the emotion and individuality they bring.

I look at Paul Rudd in every single film and see Paul Rudd with the exact same smirk and the same personality. Let's just face it, he has limited range and isn't a very good actor.

He is hilarious and a great entertainer though, and I enjoy the movies he's in."
"From the Wikipedia page on Trickle-Down Economics:

&gt;In recent history, the phrase has been most used by critics of supply-side economic policies, such as ""Reaganomics"". David Stockman, who as Reagan's budget director championed Reagan's tax cuts at first, but then became critical of them, told journalist William Greider that the ""supply-side economics"" is the trickle-down idea: ""It's kind of hard to sell 'trickle down,' so the supply-side formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really 'trickle down.' Supply-side is 'trickle-down' theory."" Political opponents of the Reagan administration soon seized on this language in an effort to brand the administration as caring only about the wealthy."

"Worked at a Mattress Store for ten years.  Had good rapport with female customer, we were laughing as she tried several beds.  Got to one bed and instead of laying down she hopped on to her hands and knees and rocked back and forth for a while.  Looked over at me and said,""You don't just sleep on them"".  Continued trying out beds for a while.  Yes I know what you are thinking, I got the sale.

Had a douchey guy come in with his mail order bride and start bragging loudly about how he would be getting the most expensive bed in the store...Showed him the $9000 King set.  Didn't say anything else just looked at him while his wife gyrated around on the bed.  He goes ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" She looked at him and nodded.  Out came the credit card.  Entire sale consisted of me saying ""Over here sir"".

Had guy pull up in drug dealer car walk in and buy $2000 bed in cash, rolls of 20's When asking his information he told me his name was John and that he didn't have a phone number or address.  We deposited his money early that night, we didn't want to have it around when he came back later to steal it back. 

The number of crazy people claiming that we should all be sleeping on just wool, or just foam or just wood or just metal or none of those things ever!  Or that they knew the boss of the company or that they used to own our company or just blatantly lie about shit. Or who would assume they knew anything about beds when they hadn't shopped for beds in the past fifteen years and that we were all trying to scam them and that $150 beds were just as good as $2000 beds and it was all a conspiracy was enormous.  

Just talk to the sales person, they are there to help.  If you have such few people skills that you can't tell if they are blatantly lying to you maybe take a friend along but 98% of salespeople will tell you the truth and at national brand stores no one is scamming you or perhaps everyone is scamming you equally so listen to their recommendations.  Oh yeah, last thing firm beds are bullshit and will hurt you.  Get something that takes your shape instead of forcing you to take its shape, you'll sleep better."

We fire a few, but the firecracker is pretty heavy, so it doesn't get much travel.  In an effort to make it fly farther, he aims it way up and lets loose.  That fucker fleeeeeew.  Later we heard about a fire a street over where a derelict shed had caught firesomehow and burned a guy's whole backhard down, including a nice deck and pool.

In the course of the mugging, he wrestled the gun away from his two attackers, and in the scuffle, he was shot in the penis, arm, and leg. Hearing the shots, 2 officers at a nearby gas station ran into the alley immediately after the 2 assailants fled out the other end. So, according to the report, the officers ran into the alley and saw the victim/defendant (our client) stumble and drop a gun, he was clearly bleeding as he had been shot, but just in case he had another gun, they kicked him in the stomach then called an ambulance. The officers recounted what they witnessed and filled in the earlier parts of the account with the statement from our client."

Immediately after closing and when I say immediately I mean when we are unpacking after moving in she pressures me to have kids.  I say no and say we need to settle into our house and lets wait a while we are still young and not even married. Side note we have not had sex in a long time this will become relevant soon. 

Less then two months after moving I get home from work greet bitch and head up stairs to use the computer to play some games and chill for a bit.  I need to pee and head down and am greeted by bitch getting fucked doggy style by dick.

Argument ensues and I go to my fathers house to cool off and get advice from him.  Well after cooling off I talk with bitch and we agree to go our separate ways.  She wants to be with dick and she leaves me with the house and bills and takes my dog and leaves. End of story?  nope.

She then spread awful rumors about me around town so it would look like dick was her night in shining armor and saving her.  She went hours away and turned my dog into a shelter and I never saw the dog again.  and took some sentimental items of mine and held them hostage until I paid her money to buy a computer.  I never paid anything but the worst was a couple months after all this happened I ran into a old friend of hers who told me that she had been fucking dick for a while trying to get pregnant and then she was going to say it was mine and try and get me to raise it.  So dodged a bullet there."

"A few years after getting married and moving to the opposite side of the country, my wife and I were looking at moving out of our apartment and getting a house. Were thinking along the lines of a 2/3 bedroom as close as to our jobs (which are in urban areas) as we could afford (i.e. a pretty typical starter home).  

My Dad's recommendation:  3000 to 4000 square feet, two acre yard, on the water with a dock, and a big side area to park a motor home in (he and Mom have a big one), and way in the country, preferably a two hour drive from the nearest city. He figured he'd get a boat to put there and 'let me use it sometimes', although in exchange he'd expect me to handle the maintenance and insurance/taxes/etc fees. (Note:  I hate boats). Second Note: no offer to assist in any way, such as helping out with the down payment.  

Well, I guess if your sole criteria is 'nice vacation home to play with the grandchildren at' those are nice specs.

Needless to say we got ourselves a little starter home.

"This is going to be difficult to talk about without making it easy to find out the people I'm talking about. But I'm going to talk about it anyway because it happened fairly recently and it's something that still sticks with me.

Me and three flatmates started working on a game together during our second year of (UK) university. What was originally just for an end-of-year project started to gain a huge amount of momentum, at least for a student game.

We entered an international student games competition, and were one of the three winning teams from across the entire world. The three winning teams were nominated for a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television) Games award.

We showed the game at the Leftfield collection at EGX, a UK game convention that had 80,000 attendees that year. We were one of 20 submissions accepted, narrowed down from over 200. We were showing alongside a new game made by 3rd party Sony developer of Hohokum.

PC Gamer, a magazine I used to pretend to be able to read when I snuck into my brother's room as a kid, previewed our game. Our game was a page away from a preview of XCOM 2. Seeing our game talked about in print - and next to a franchise I revered - was mind blowing.

We had interest from several publishers, but one that stood out (I shan't name them as it doesn't seem right to do so) asked us over Skype how much we wanted. As in, they just asked how much money we needed to make the game into a finished product. They didn't set us a time frame, or request any control over the product. They just asked us: ""How much do you want?""

All the time and risk I had put into this project seemed like it was going to come back ten-fold. It was going to fast track us all to the careers we wanted. We could set up our own studio. Our own funded studio. All the contacts we had made since the beginning of the project, including Chucklefish (makers of Starbound) and Payload Studios (makers of TerraTech) and The Indie Stone (makers of Project Zomboid), told us that university didn't matter - not for games. If you can make and finish a game, do it. It's more valuable than any piece of paper you can get from your classes.

So what did we do? We stopped making the game. The team no longer ""found it fun"" to work on the game. The rest of the team set it aside so they could ""focus on their own individual projects"". For an entire year I've had to live with the same people, each day trying to forget, or forgive, or in any way move on from what we threw away.

About a month ago me and one of the team members were having a cigarette outside a pub for a friend's birthday. We hadn't talked in a while.

He said to me, ""it was just a student project. That's all it was ever meant to be""."

"In Paris we arrived at the hotel we had booked to find the doors locked to the reception. We stood outside wondering what was going on when a minute later a French guy came up to us and said he too had a booking at the hotel and was worried as he couldn't get in either. We stood there talking to him for about 10 mins, in which time he starts to become quite stressed about not getting in and keeps asking what we are all going to do repeatedly, never satisfied by our answers. Then he suddenly becomes calm and says ""come with me"", of course we say no. ""Come with me, I'm actually the receptionist of the hotel and this entrance we don't use anymore, it's up the street"". You know what? That was actually true! So we go with him and as he's checking us in he asks ""How did it make you feel when I did that? Can you write down the words to describe it?"".

That was more odd than scary. The scary part was when the next morning he pulled the fire alarm and locked the doors to the stairs so we were trapped up there. Needless to say, we checked out ASAP

"&gt; I feel bad that the speaker has that mindset, even if it's justified, because it is so likely to be self-fulfilling and it exposes a ready-to-be-defeated attitude that young people shouldn't have.

This is a good point.

While defeatism and self-pity are natural feelings, I personally believe that every effort should be made to counter them in our own minds. 

These patterns of thought might be justified at any given moment, but they are also habit-forming, energy drains, and usually not accurate in the broader sense of our lives.

What's more, negative thinking is almost certain to undermine every project one undertakes. It slows down how fast one can learn new things, dampens creativity, lessens attractiveness, decreases pain tolerance, and leaves one prone to give up at the first sign of trouble. 

Even if you believe you're naturally a slow learner with little creative ability who lacks attractiveness, pain tolerance, or perseverance, a negative attitude will almost certainly amplify those deficits, and compound the effects of any misfortune you might meet or poor choices you might make. 

This seems to me a handicap worth mitigating as much as possible.

You do not want to miss out on valuable forgotten moments with friends because you had to write a paper or an online assignment. Obviously there will be times when you need to stay in and get work done, but a lot of it could be avoided with good time management, going to the library after lunch, and having study groups during the day. You may only have three hours of class a day, leaving the remaining six of a typical high school day for yourself: use it wisely.

"We had a neighbor that was a bit stalker-y growing up. He was always kind of off, and had a bit too much interest in how my parents set up their house.

Creepy thing was, she has NEVER gone by her middle name, so unless he was reading our mail or looking up bill-of-sale records with the city he could not have known what her middle name was. 

The guy also called my dad's work 5-6 times in the middle of the day to report an emergency. The emergency? Some kid was joyriding his parent's car, drove into our yard and messed up the landscaping. I was at home the entire time..."

She tried to get it before it got her, poisoning it several times, even tried to destroy the demon's source of power - your hedges - but it was no use. The demon had been allowed to grow too strong, protected by its clueless owners unknowingly harbouring an ancient, insidious evil.

Eventually she fell ill, poisoned by the demon - she knew it was true, the demon had gotten to her somehow. She tried to tell her husband, pleaded with him to kill the demon dog as she coughed and sputtered, too weak by now to even stand, but he just smiled at her and said ""I know"". He placed a shorn piece of your hedges next to her bed and closed the door behind him. She swore she could hear him howling at night.

After she passed, he invited you all over frequently for barbecues to thank you for your loyalty to the master. Then he got himself his own dog, a smaller, less threatening form for his master..."

"Couple years back a frozen yogurt shop opened up right next to a *very* popular local burger joint.  I'm talking 30-45 minute wait during peak hours.  Whole little league teams.  Despite the horrendous parking you'd think that they would do reasonably well with all that built-in foot traffic right there.

Except they did not take into account that this burger joint is *also* known locally for having the best damn shakes in town.  Who is going to get frozen yogurt after a meal at a burger joint that makes orgasm-inducing shakes?

No one.  That's who.  And so they added a sign to the yogurt sign up front.  ""Espresso &amp; Yogurt"".  Ok...  Trying to get some morning coffee go-ers and what not.  I get it.   

Except that the burger joint a) also serves breakfast with free coffee and b) there is a coffee place across the street with *good* parking AND a drive-thru. 

Before long another popup is added to the sign.  ""Pizza &amp; Espresso &amp; Frozen Yogurt"".  

Because a pizza joint that serves frozen yogurt and espresso in a lot with no parking is just a swell business plan.  Instead of fresh-baked pizza, the only smell coming out of that place was forlorn desperation."

"Single dad and his daughter moved in next door, daughter was assigned to same class as our 12 year old. She was a wild-child - pretty, manipulative, deceitful, with a thin veneer of girlish charm -  and her father refused to discipline her because he considered her shenanigans ""cute"".

Those shenanigans started with convincing our daughter to ditch school, and grew to include raiding our liquor cabinet, smoking pot, sneaking out the window, sneaking boys  *in* the window, asking strangers to pull booze for them at the local, ""borrowing"" her mother's car, etc. At fourteen, they were both brought home by the cops at 2 AM, pissed out of their mind, reeking of vomit, and without panties. Friend's dad was nowhere to be found, and in fact did not show up and collect his daughter from Protective Services for three more days.

Forbidding our daughter to see her borderline-sociopath BFF did nothing. Speaking to her father did nothing - he just said that such misbehaviour was part of teenagers ""testing their limits"", and that we should relax and let them have some fun. That was when we finally realized that although the daughter was trouble incarnate, *he* was the truly dangerous one.

Through the next two years, whenever another incident happened, or another principal's office / court appearance was scheduled, he'd continually ask us over ""for a beer and to talk things out"". We refused. We also insisted on using separate lawyers, which seemed to piss him off to no end.

Finally, just before our daughter's sixteenth birthday, both of them got sent to a youth detention centre for sixty days, for breaking into a community centre and doing a bunch of damage. Shortly after the girls got out again, friend and her dad abandoned the house next door and disappeared. They left all the furniture. There was even food in the cupboard. The only things they took were their cat, clothing and bedding.

Her time in custody scared the shit out of our kid, and she slowly began mending her ways. Over a lot of heartbreak and tears we managed, with the aid of a good family counsellor, to help her straighten herself out without too much backsliding. She graduated from high school two years late, but with good marks. Because her juvie record was sealed, she managed to find a pretty good part-time job shortly afterward, and started saving her money to buy a car. She even volunteered to start kicking in a few bucks now and again for room and board.

A little over a year ago, friend called our daughter and asked to meet, so they could ""catch up"". We advised her not to go, but she chose to meet friend at a nearby restaurant anyway. She returned half an hour later, red-faced, furious, and in tears. She refused to say what happened.

It was a full day and a half before we managed to convince her to tell us what transpired. Turns out friend is now a full-bore, 20 year old coke-addicted prostitute, and her dad is her pimp. And the purpose of the get-together (dad was there) was to make overtures to our daughter about joining his stable.

We called an acquaintance who was on the detective squad. He looked them up and quietly warned them both not to attempt any further contact with either our daughter or us, or he would make them one of his ""special projects"". We've not heard from them since, thank heaven.  

Yeah, they were both ""neighbours from hell"", I think.

"A lot. I'll try to write some examples and when I played them.

Around 1990, Super Mario Bros. 3 after only knowing C64 games and SMB1 and 2. Amazing platformer.

Secret of Mana, ca. 1994-ish. I enjoyed Zelda a LOT but Secret of Mana blew my mind, you had the awesome battlesystem with a lot of weapons and items and *multiplayer*. It was truly amazing at the time. It was basically my first jrpg as well (Info: I'm from germany. We didn't have lots of rpgs on our consoles)

Final Fantasy VII, around 1998 I think, it was amazing. The score blew me away. I still remember being glued to the screen, it was like playing an action movie ... and then they left midgar. Fuck you squaresoft.

Super Mario 64. Maybe 1997? The N64 wasn't the greatest console, but Mario 64 was amazing. I wanted it for so long, I first saw Mario 64 on that VHS, I don't remember where I got that VHS but I had it. And I rewatched it a lot and I was very hyped. Mario 64 didn't disappoint. It had amazing levels, even the hub world was awesome. I loved it.

Final Fantasy X. Around 2001-ish? Everything in this game looked so brilliant. After only knowing the PS1 Final Fantasy games I had to get it. And god it was so worth it. (except for maybe one or two little regrets here and there ... cringeworthy VA for example) but it looked so amazing, the battle system was fresh and new, I played the demo a lot and still have the FFX Demo today.

Nothing, for a long time. The following console generations were pretty much more of the same. Or maybe I just grew up. But this generation blew me away again:

**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**. 2016. I played both witcher games before, they were okay. The stories were amazing, the characters awesome and the score astounding. But the third iteration kicked both games in the nuts, threw them into a river and drowned them with its awesomeness. The third Witcher game has everything I loved in the first two. But it looks brilliant, the battle system is great and I really like the simpler alchemy system (even though I miss the more complex one from TW2). I was basically stuck in a world that I had only *imagined* before. Videogames grew so much in just my lifetime. It's been a wild ride, 27 years and now we're here.

I hope my next 27 years will be just as awesome. Thank you videogames.

"This will probably get buried, but I sent an email to myself back in 2005 intended for my future self on December 22nd, 2012 - obviously I'd completely forgotten about it in that time.

Sure enough, I noticed a weird email in my inbox on 12/22/12, so I opened it. 

*Dear future pm_me_jk_dont,*

*Congrats on surviving the end of the world! The Ancient Mayans stood no chance going up against you!*

*Sincerely,*

*Past pm_me_jk_dont*

These days, I still use Futureme pretty frequently. I'm only 23, but if I see a good article about parenting or something, I'll email it to myself 10 years in the future. It's a great website for reminders like that."
"I think the narration delivers a grander story in Dances with Wolves, though Goodfellas may have it been on straight up entertainment value."
"&gt; I see where she's coming from, body positivity and all, but her attitude really stinks of hypocrisy.

That's the entire HAES movement in a nutshell.  They love all bodies, but only if they're women, and only if they're fat.  Fat guys are gross and skinny girls are anorexic bitches."
"And that's what I love about that movie! She's painted the jerk because we only get to see the story from Joseph Gordon-Levitt's view! 

It's a beautiful flawed retelling. We never see ourselves as the villain in our story, so when we tell our friends about it, of course the other person comes off bad!

It took me years to realize that I wasn't the best I could have been in my last failed relationship. YEARS where I blamed her for things not working out, when really I was just as at fault. 

It even hints it at the beginning of the film, the the opening line:
""The following is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental. Especially you Jenny Beckman. Bitch.""

With that line, even though we don't know Jenny Beckman, our view of her is slightly tainted by the author. "
"That's actually a really good point. It's just a ton of people flying off the handlebars because other people had the audacity to be offended by something.  
  
I was really into that sub for a long time. I spent a *lot* of time there. Then, one day, I realized I wasn't somehow a good person because I was spending my time mocking teens on the internet, and I couldn't ignore the sub's rampant habit of calling rape victims liars.

Other than that, people are very much homophobic, they hate any and everything that's western.

"I'm pretty sure my high school choir teacher and his wife did this. He seems pretty gay to everyone and I got major lesbian vibes off his wife, (I think there's evidence that gay people can indeed sense each other, lol) they seemed more like close friends than a romantic couple. Neither of their kids look anything like them, they're most likely adopted. They got married in the 70's, and people just didn't come out back then. It's so sad that they felt forced to do this in the first place, but I am happy that they had each other instead of finding a straight partner whose love they could never return. Even if it wasn't romantic, they had a companion through it all."
"* 1. I never want to be pregnant. The very thought of something growing inside of me makes me want to claw my own skin off. 
* 2. I would be a terrible parent. I have trouble taking care of my cat. I dread to think what would happen to a small child. The cat, at least, I can leave alone for hours unattended knowing that the most she'll do is scratch my couch.
* 3. I can't stand the noise. I am a person who enjoys peace and quiet and alone time. With children, ""alone time"" becomes a thing of the past and quiet is near non-existent.
* 4. My SO doesn't like children. Neither of us do, honestly. I can deal with them as long as I can give them back to their parents at the end of the day, but he wants nothing to do with them.
* 5. Both my SO and I have a family history of physical and mental issues, including but not limited to: diabetes, various heart conditions, bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, and mild to severe back problems. It's better to not take a gamble and potentially produce a child who may have to deal with some or all of that (if not more)."

"I dont think it is exactly that. I think that a large part of it has to do with the fact that a lot of women have had more than once occurrence of aggressive men on dates. Its much more safe to be a little wary and aware of your surroundings and what not than to just expect everyone is nice. Yes, a few assholes pollute the pool but its just a sad part of being a woman. You notice how when something does go wrong often people are blamed for not being more aware or safer. Its a vicious cycle that lends to a lot of unfair treatment of both genders. Im not saying its right, just that it is part of being a woman and self protection.  "

"This wasn't at a proper restaurant but one of those cafes that has a fairly sizeable menu.  And this was a chain, so not a little hipster place but one that had a half-dozen locations in our city alone.

Pretty much all of our stuff came in frozen and was ""cooked"" by reheating it.  *Most* of was at least reheated in ovens/frying pans or on the griddle, except the sauces, but it was still ""frozen fresh"" crap.

One lady ordered one of the more expensive ""entree"" meals, so the cooks whipped it up and I ran it out to her.  As I was turning to head back behind the counter, having a list of drinks that I needed to make, she called me back.

""This was frozen and reheated,"" she said, quite disgruntled.

""Yes, sorry, is it not warm through?"" I asked.

""It is, but it doesn't taste right.  It tastes like it's been reheated.  Take it back and have them make me a fresh one.""

""Ma'am, all of our food is frozen and reheated except for our salads.  They can't make you a fresh one.""

""Of course they can.  I go to the [chain location across the city] all the time and they make me fresh [dish] all the time.""

""I doubt that, ma'am.  We're all supplied with the same food in the same condition.  Even if they do, though, *we* cannot.  We only have this frozen and don't have the ingredients to make it fresh.""

Cue a five minute back and forth on how the other location *totally* made her this thing fresh and we had to as well.  I finally had to go get a manager because she would not believe me and I had a line of drink tickets growing by the minute.

She ended up leaving 10 minutes later after my manager comped her meal, and I got a free lunch for having to put up with it."
"&gt;I certainly hope you don't look back over your life when you're 35 and think wow, I wish I hadn't spend so much time worrying about whether I wanted children so I could have actually enjoyed the time when I didn't have children.

I doubt this will happen. It's 100 percent ok for people to investigate their options. Doesn't mean it's going to become life consuming.

Better advice would be to steer clear of certain childfree subs and forums, and on the flipside hardcore kid having advovates, because there's a lot of intolerance for kids/obsession with having kids on those that can lead to toxic discussions. Gather info and seek possible ways you may live and paths you may take for sure, just avoid one sided discussion.

"Confidence and personality matters the most, regardless what sex you are. If you're a male and you're short and every time you're talking to a girl or in a group you mention how short you are, it just further brings that out and shows how insecure you are. I had a friend that always did this and it drove me insane, and other girls would even mention how if he'd just shut up about it, it'd be ok. Just act normal, pretend you're 6'2 like the rest of us. As a guy, it doesn't matter how hot the girl is, if her personality sucks, it will make her hotness disappear. Looks get you in the door, personality keeps you there. In fact, it even makes you more attractive the more confident you are and the better your personality. Always be kind and courteous to others, and always exude confidence. This will help drastically if you are someone that has a hard time getting a date because you feel you aren't attractive enough.

Everyone can make themselves slightly more attractive. Get a nice haircut, put on some clothes that are not wrinkled and fit well to your body shape if you are a male. Have a few nice button ups and some dark jeans with something other than ""sneakers"", like Clarks Wallabee's. As for girls, a little make up and the same thing in regards to hair and clothes will go a long way as well. You'd be shocked what just these things can do. A good, stylish haircut can literally make you almost look like a different person."

"I was running a corp in Eve for a good long while and this uppity Manc joined up with us. Couldn't have been a few weeks to a month of playing together every day and night and we got to be good friends. Same age, similar situations, both of us very confident and loud. This is the guy I would have liked to go drinking with, we pick a fight, take a licking and then talk about it for years later. Good people.

 His wife had some health issues and was paralyzed, so he, the wonderful husband, was always taking care of her and their kids, always updating us on things, just a great dude. 

One day out of the blue, he is a no show. For like three days, nothing, and in Eve, that is odd. He finally shows back up, only to find out, out of the fucking blue, no signs, no problems, his wife had died. He and I just talked for hours on Mumble about everything. He was totally broken, totally out of his wits. I managed to get him to laugh one time that night. He told me it was the first time he had laughed or even cracked a smile in the three days since she had died. Not his family or friends he'd had for decades could move him, but this stranger he knew for what were literally weeks, was able to break his funk. Sometimes it's not the game. It's the people you play with. R.I.P. Bernie. "

I prefer someone who can embrace singleness and live their own independent life, not constantly worrying about when the next love interest is going to come around, and constantly searching for it.

"I'd argue that human beings, as animals, have a biological deference to corporal punishment and it CAN be used, in moderation and judiciously, to quickly and effectively correct improper behavior in children. 

Mammalian behavior almost universally employs minor acts of physical dominance to correct behavior of societal members. Used sparingly, it's quick, effective, and elicits an almost immediate compliance. When that members behavior is unsafe and needs to be ended immediately, a spanking will effect that change more rapidly and with much less expended resources than alternative methods.

Overused, it creates almost the exact opposite effect."

"I am very well aware of how somewhat selfish this may make me look, but it was a tough decision nonetheless. 

I have recently just graduated, and my buddy that has been my best friend since 2007 and I had plans to move in together as we were going to the same college anyways. A wrench got thrown in when I instead had to go to a different college. This caused us to not live together, which sucked.

Instead of his roommate being me, he opted to house up with someone who I consider to be mentally and emotionally abusive to her friends and mostly him. Not in a mean way but in a ""If you're not friends with me I'll attempt stupid ways of suicide which subtly say it's because my friends suck"" kind of thing if that makes sense. The night this because blatantly obvious was when we went to a party, my buddy and I were having an awesome time and him and his now roommate were becoming closer friends. She does not like me in the slightest, so instead of buggering off she opts to cut deep into her wrists due to ""Not having true friends"".

I was, to say the least, furious when I found out about this as I was previously in a mentally abusive relationship. This caused a lot of arguments between myself and my friend on why he shouldn't room with her because I was worried. Eventually, I just kind have given up. He knows the signs that she can be mean but part of me thinks he also enjoys her company. Who am I to ruin that? I just worry about him a lot. 

TLDR; Friend opted to become roommates with someone who is knowingly suicidal and has a history of being mentally abusive. I opted to let things happen instead of ruining my friendship with him in hopes of her being better now."

"At a beloved Canadian coffee shop ordering my usual coffee and bagel when I notice the worker behind the counter, making my bagel, had a band aid on her hand and no gloves on. 

I asked if she could put a glove on before cutting and buttering my bagel and she did so without hesitation.

I walk out, get in my car, unwrap my bagel as I'm pulling out and lo and behold, there is blood on it.

I walk back into the coffee shop, back to the counter and showed the worker the bagel she just gave me and asked for a new one . I notice at this point she wasn't wearing gloves again, so I asked her to please put a glove on, again. 

She walked away, came back with a manager who immediately asked me why I was harassing her employees about their ""impeccable health and safety standards"". I told her my story, showed her the bagel, pointed to her employee's bandaged hand and asked why she wasn't wearing a glove. The manager accuses me of putting blood on my own bagel outside the restaurant to create ""drama"".

At this point there was a long line watching the events unfold. I asked again if the manager was going to correct the issue. The employee had begun preparing other food items at this time, again not wearing a glove over her bandaid. The manager got belligerent and told me if I didn't leave she was calling the cops for harassment and she would have me banned from every franchise of this coffee shop in town. She got extremely irate over a dollar bagel. I lost it. I let that manager have it and started yelling about the blood on my food and how the same employee was making everyone else's food without proper health and safety procedures. I made sure everyone in the coffee shop could hear me. People began to leave the lineup, cancel food ordera, and some even started demanding refunds.

If the manager simply acknowledged the mistake and even offered to exchange my bagel I would've walked out of there happy, but that just wasn't happening that day and so I became a fucking asshole in a coffee shop at 7AM on a Monday.

In the city they have this share ride Uber thing so there was some other person in the passenger seat. She starts making out with me and I tell her to wait until we get back to her place. We argue for a good 5 minutes to whether it was ethical and whether it would weird them out if we continued. She takes off her seat belt and sits in the space next to my feet pulls me down makes out with me a bit more saying it was okay they won't know and goes down on me.

She slaps him. He calls her a bitch. She starts smacking him in the face. He's trying to fend off her half-inch press-ons. I'm just staring ahead, pretending not to notice the reality show drama ensuing in the backseat. Eventually she tires herself out and begins to sob uncontrollably and tells me to pullover, so pull into the nearest shopping center and park. She jumps out and runs off. The guy remains. Just sits there. Then he tells me to take him to a new destination. But, I can't, because I've already closed the ride. He calls bullshit and I try to explain to him that he can request a new ride but that it will go out the next available waiting driver in the area and probably won't be me (busy metro area). He calls me an asshole and threatens to mess my shit up and tries to get me out of the car to fight him. I explained to him again how the ride app works and he mumbles and moans but eventually shuffles off.

"Damn, I feel weird after reading your post.  For the last week I've been encountering many of my exes, culminating with last night, when I talked to  one of the two women who I would have settled down with.  I brought up the fact that she used to complain whenever I ""put her on a pedestal"" (exact words used) when we were together.

It was an interesting, post-relationship discussion.  Her main thought was that my admiration of her came from the fact I have a lot of scumbags in my life, and that she has low self-esteem, so she can't accept she might be a great person.  I counterpointed with examples of how she made my own life better, even being there for me more than my own flesh and blood was, and that she needed to accept her positive qualities, rather than just the negative.

There was no magical reunion, no decision to try and rekindle what we had for years.  I'm not sure when or if we'll talk again.  But reading your post, I can see bits of myself in the traits you describe about people who put others on a pedestal.  I can also see bits of my ex in some of the traits you noted, reminding me of her behavior toward me when we reconnected after college and she was very big on our relationship moving fast.

You gave me some food for thought."

I've seen a lot more vocal support for male survivors on tumblr than I've seen anywhere else, including reddit. In fact, I've seen the sentiment about rape victims being weak on reddit fairly often or that it's ""awesome"" if a female school teacher rapes a male student. That's not a commonplace opinion on reddit but I've seen it, where I've never seen people say that on tumblr and get away with it.

"I played trumpet in the house band for Celebrity ships for 3 contracts, so I might be able to answer some of your questions.

For the audition, you set up a time and a day during the week. Mine was at 3pm on a weekday. *Note, I went right through the musician scheduler at Celebrity, not an agency, but they are similar auditions.* 

At 3pm, the guy emailed me pdfs of the audition music, and I had 1 hour to print out 30 pages of music, sight read it, barely practice it, all before he called me at 4pm. Once on the phone, he asked me to play a couple of pieces from the Real Book, head and solo. After that, he asked for the pdfs to be played in a certain order, one of which I was sent an mp3 to play along with while on the phone. This was all music that they used on the ship. They might ask you to play some high notes/show off your range if you're a trumpet player. 

I got the job first time around, but there wasn't a spot for me on a ship for a few months, so I decided to see if Carnival had anything. Their audition process was the exact same, only it was over Skype. 

If you can't sight read extremely proficiently, don't bother auditioning until you can. When you get on the ship, you will have one rehearsal for each show right before the show, so if you can't play the music 99% accurately right away, you'll be fired. Obviously it depends on the band master and staffing from head office, but I've been on contracts where the drummer was sent home in the first port because he was shit. This is not meant to scare you, but just know that even if the band master is a nice guy, the other band members might complain about you if you can't play well. 

Music for house band ranged from pop music for the cast shows, to big band music for 7 piece band in the lounges, to the most terribly arranged charts you've ever seen brought by the guest entertainers. 

Long story short, if you can sight read and make it sound like you've had the music for years, you'll be fine. 

If you have any other questions or just want to talk about it, send me a pm. Would be glad to help answer any questions, I know I was nervous for my first contract. "

"The Space Shuttle wasn't what it was hyped up to be.

Amazing?  Yes.  Awe-inspiring?  You bet.  The most complicated vehicle ever produced?  Mmmhmm.  Do I watch launch videos while a Bald Eagle gently wipes patriotic tears from my eyes?  Daily.  That being said, it wasn't an ideal launch vehicle.

To start, it was dangerous.  More astronauts died on the shuttle than any other U.S. launch vehicle/spacecraft.  In fact, the shuttle represents the only incidents of operational LOCV (loss of crew and vehicle) in the entire U.S. space program (if you don't count X15 flights).  Granted, the shuttle carried more astronauts than any previous spacecraft, and the shuttle has had more launches than any previous man-rated launch vehicle, but Mercury/Redstone, Mercury/Atlas, Gemini/Titan and Apollo/Saturn never experienced a single operational LOCV - the only other instance of U.S. astronaut deaths were the pad deaths of Gus Grissom, Roger Chafee and Ed White on Apollo 1.  Rather than developing a vehicle that *improved* reliability and safety of vehicles that came before it, NASA (and to a lesser extent, the Air force) chose a launch vehicle that was far more complicated than those before it...not the best idea when it comes to something as enormously complicated as space flight.

Part of the problem was the design of the shuttle...unlike every launch vehicle before it, it lacked any form of crew escape.  Mercury and Apollo had launch escape systems (where the entire capsule was pulled free of the failing launcher via a powerful rocket attached to the top of the CM) and Gemini had ejector seats.  The first 4 (or 9, but I think 4) space shuttles were equipped with ejector seats, but not only would astronauts risk being ejected into the massive exhaust plume of the SRB's, the seats were effective for a very small portion of the flight envelope, and astronauts sitting midships (below deck) had no such seats.  That method of ejection might have saved the crew of STS-51-L (Challenger) who were on the flight deck, but it wouldn't have saved the crew of STS-107 (Columbia) who would have ejected into a hypersonic windblast.  

A capsule (think Apollo, Soyuz, or the forthcoming Orion) is designed to separate and withstand reentry...it's already built to protect the crew, thus, giving it modes of rapid escape is both easier and more cost effective.  An ejection capsule (the only real method of offering full protection to a crew) built into the shuttle would have been extremely difficult to implement.  Not only would it need to be large enough to fit the entire crew of 7, but it would need complicated aerodynamic features and heavy heat shields to protect it during all portions of ascent and decent (another great feature of a capsule is that it's already aerodynamically optimized).  Ejection capsules have been tested in different forms on air breathing aircraft (B-58, XB-70, B1-A, F111) but are generally difficult to implement correctly - multiply the problems mere atmosphere-limited aircraft face times 1,000 and you can get an idea of how difficult a proper shuttle LES would be to construct.  The long and short is - in order to make the shuttle somewhat cost effective (which it never was) Rockwell had to ditch the idea of a true LES.

Then there is the issue of weight.  The Saturn V had a payload to LEO capacity of +/- 310,000 lbs...the space shuttle had a payload to LEO of +/- 60,000 lbs.  The Shuttle stack had a liftoff thrust of 6.8 million lbs/thrust...the Saturn V had a liftoff thrust of 7.6 million lbs/thrust.  Any cargo that went up with the shuttle had to ride in the heave orbiter - essentially, the orbiter was part of the cargo, severely limiting the total payload the Shuttle could carry to orbit.  The Saturn V was capible of carrying both manned capsules to LEO and TLI, and heavy, outsized cargo (Skylab) that the Shuttle simply couldn't fit in it's bay or get to orbit given the output of is engines.  Another benefit to a more traditional rocket (Saturn V) vs. the Shuttle stack is that a rocket can be gradually modified to carry larger (by volume) and more powerful (by total amount of payload lifted) upper stages to orbit.  Look at the evolution of Titan...from Titan II to Titan IIIE with it's wider Centaur upper stage and strap-on ([heh](http://www.reactiongifs.com/lol-duck/)) boosters.  That kind of evolution was never possible with the Space Shuttle.  Actually, one thing the Soviets did right when they created a near carbon copy of the orbiter (Buran) was mount all of the engines save for the OMS on the Energia body (in other words, instead of placing the shuttles engines on the shuttle itself, they fitted them to their equivalent of the large, orange, external fuel tank).  This allowed the Energia to launch an orbiter or a cargo faring, either mounted on the side or on top.  

The weight penalty became quite obvious when constructing the ISS.  If NASA had used a Saturn V, they could have completed the bulk of construction of the station in a few launches.  Instead, it took several times more launches (costing more per inflation-adjusted dollar) to bring the necessary components to orbit.  While I don't have the time (or the memory) to recall just how much it cost pound versus pound for both launchers, I do believe the Saturn V was a good deal cheaper.

There were other issues, too...Morton Thiokol knew of problems related to the SRB and gas discharge around the o-rings before launch - engineers pressed both MT upper-management and NASA to scrub the Challenger launch, but NASA, pressed to make the Shuttle-program look as efficient (in terms of # of launches possible per year) decided not to press on, leading to disaster 68 seconds into launch.  NASA's bureaucratic incompetence reared its ugly head again in 2003 when they chose not to investigate further the possibility of damage to the orbiters thermal protection system (even declining to use DOD spy satellites to photograph the orbiter) when the possibility of a debris strike became evident.  Because the entire shuttle needed thermal protection, and because it was exposed during launch (unlike a capsule which has a protective cover on it during launch, and a heat shield covered by the inter-stage coupling), it always had a greater chance of being exposed to damage and thus, LOCV (loss of crew and vehicle).

There is more to the story than what I just wrote, but the decision to cancel the shuttle was quite pragmatic.  I managed to see one launch of the shuttle back in 2011 and to this day, thinking about it still brings a bit of moisture to my eyes - the absolute majesty of the shuttle ascending is breathtaking.  But, to quote Richard Feynman from his time on the Rogers Commission: ""For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."" "

"My family finally had enough. My mom grabbed me and drove me an hour away to a shitty neighborhood and dropped me off with nothing but the clothes on my back and half a bottle of narcotic painkillers. I was an active drug addict for almost eight years at this point, and sparing the awful details of my habit, I'd stolen from everyone I knew, jumped from couch to couch and just made everyone miserable. 

I spent the first night in this town in the homeless shelter, but got kicked out the next morning. I don't want to disclose the name of the facility for privacy's sake, but I found a drug rehabilitation center that was willing to help me. I'll never forget the guy who helped me - he had two different colored eyes and a crazy messed up face. He'd seen some shit in his time. He was a recovered addict and went way out of his way to help... I was withdrawing from heroin and benzodiazepines, so it was pretty urgent. It was astounding how personally invested he became in my recovery. I ended up in a treatment center for two weeks where they got me detoxed and stabilized, and I just never used again. It's been just a little over two years since that ordeal, and while it doesn't sound as bad as many of the ""rock bottom"" stories I've heard, it worked for me. Seeing my family so sick of my shit that they were willing to dispose of me so easily really hit me hard. I'm employed, bought my first car, living in a nice townhouse and am clean. 

My mom told me this recently- when she was driving me away and I was half-drugged/half-awake, it was overcast and slightly stormy, but she saw a rainbow in the rear view mirror and just knew that everything was going to be ok, even though she was going through one of the worst things she's ever had to do.

"&gt; He would compensate with tariffs or something that will make it more economical for American business to order American goods, thus hiring American workers.

Even if China didn't retaliate by jacking up tariffs of their own (which, obviously, is exactly what they would do), higher tariffs on China don't give American businesses an incentive to spend the money it would take to start up new factories here in America.

Mostly it gives an advantage to manufacturers with foreign factories outside of China in countries that have cheap labor, unless Trump wants a global trade war instead of just a trade war with China.

The rational thing for companies to do is to bide their time until the tariffs are repealed. Imagine the GOP going into the midterm election, with higher consumer prices and a hurting economy due to the tariffs. How quickly would they cave?

After I come back from a vacation, a new guy who was always trying to impress the boss decided that assigning me work on his project would show great leadership. Of course, that's not how he presented it. 

He started scheduling meetings ""with his team"" everyday and giving out assignments. I had just gotten back from vacation, so it took me a little bit to figure out that this wasn't sanctioned at all.

The boss was less than impressed when he found out this guy had been trying to get other employees that ""I didn't think were busy enough"" to work his project.

"fun when you catch someone tho, storytime.

I started this private server and invited people I knew, there were maybe 20 players. There was this kid that within 20 minutes of joining was like ""I FOUND DIAMONDS!"" I was suspicious but no proof, so whatever, he was lucky I guess. However, he kept finding more, so my friend and co-admin was like ""I've got an idea, tell him to share his screen immediately.""

So we asked him to and after a while, he finally shared his screen. Just him mining next to a lava pool, all cool like with his diamond pick. Then my friend was like ""Go to your minecraft folder and show us the mods folder."" Or something like that, IDK where you put the hacks. And then suspiciously, his Skype quits! How convenient. Now we're suspicious. 

So we ask him to reshare his screen. He shows the mods folder and goes ""See? Only optifine."" My friend goes, ""Can you go to your downloads folder?"" The idiot goes to his download folder, and lo and behold, there's a folder called Nodus. 

He immediately begins fabricating some excuse about why it's there, but we end the Skype call and ban him. All is well on the server again. "

"Having deeper interactions with people: getting to really know people one on one, bonding with people who I think are cool but haven't had time to really get to know, or improving established relationships

Getting back at people: Beating the crap out of someone who I think is a bad person, out performing someone in school, beating someone at bjj/wrestling/mma practice

Helping people: Making someone's day, saving someone from a disaster, backing someone up when they need help, giving people advice I wish I'd been given, etc.

Winning tournaments: I haven't competed enough so I think a lot about people cheering for me at the end of a tournament, getting an award or any sort, or just being congratulated is nice

Having a successful career: (1) I picture myself wearing a suit, driving a nice car, having a lot of money etc. Sometimes I picture myself being kind of condescending and douchey, which is bad, but having the means to be condescending would be pretty nice. I always wanted to be a better person than the douchey but successful people I look up to, but sometimes I start to understand why they are the way that they are. Any how, having the power and security to be able to choose whether you want to be genuinely nice or a douche would be fantastic. (2) I also try to imagine different career paths, e.g. if I was in consulting where I would be travelling to and how much time that would afford me with family and friends, if I go into investment banking the places I would be working, etc.

Sometimes it's a combination of the above.

EDIT:

I also think about tough situations and what I'd do in them. If my friend is losing a fight really badly and I know we can't win, do I help anyway? Would I risk my life to save the life of someone I don't know or would I just watch? Am I a good person, do I want to be, or do I just want people to think that I am?"

"Sure thing! I may be getting pushy here but if you are agonizing over it every day, you should just get it over with and see what happens. Living in fear and agonizing like that is not a good life.

And while I'm sure this guy is a great person, not being abusive is a pretty low bar to clear. It may seem differently to you because of your experience, but the majority of people are not abusive and you will find another person who meets that criteria if this situation ends.

I would suggest scheduling a time with him to talk, in private, and letting him know beforehand that it will be a serious conversation. That way he is mentally prepared for something serious to come up (though he won't know what it is) and he will be less likely to be totally blindsided.

But I'm sure there are people out there who are more qualified to help you discuss something like this. There are organizations out there dedicated to helping people in abusive relationships: I imagine that they probably help people recovering from past abusive relationships, too. Maybe they can give you better, more professional advice."

Most of the time when a person consumes a commercial alcohol beverage they will intake the roughly the same amount of ethanol regardless if it's beer wine or spirits. As a rule of thumb wine is twice as strong as beer, but the serving size is also about half that of beer. Hard alcohol such as rum and vodka is much stronger, but again the serving portion is significantly smaller, and is usually diluted so drinking a rum and coke can have a similar pacing to drinking beer and wine. Liqueurs are a bit of a funny one as they are significantly weaker than spirits but use the same serving size, so they are the worst to get a person drunk on a per 'drink' basis, however multiple can be consumed in a short period. A bottle of beer, glass of wine, shot of hard alcohol or ~2 shots of liqueur will get a person equally 'intoxicated.'"

"This applies to most countries from Latin America, SE Asia, etc: If you are approached by a ""normal looking"" fellow who kindly warns you about thieves in the area, *do not* pat your pocket to make sure you still have your wallet, camera, golden watch, or whatever unnecessarily expensive item you're carrying. His buddies are probably watching, and that's how they find out where you keep your important stuff; you'll probably get robbed in the next block (and never realize until you're back at your hotel).

I know it's almost a reflex to check if you still've got your shit but keep it together: if you look like a tourist and go to touristy places, you are probably being watched.

"So, we were walking around the market and saw this stand with lots of cookies and shortbreads. The guy that made them started telling me about them and it was the Honey glazed, orange-pecan shortbread that caught my attention.   
The shortbread was delicious: It wasn't too crumbly but neither was it mushy. It had the right consistency, thick and with a light honey glaze. It had a light orange flavor (and maybe orange blossom water too), the flavor was enriched by the pecans and maybe clove or nutmeg, the honey glaze gave it the extra sweetness as you bit into it. It was the best thing I ate in England.    
Needless to say I've tried to replicate the recipe but still not entirely able to figure out all the right ingredients.   "

"Nope. If it's an unexplained absence that's pretty much an automatic disciplinary, unless you have a really, really good reason.

by ""absence"" I mean me calling in 24 hours in advance and telling them I'm ill. So if one month, I have a stomach bug, and am off work for a day or two, telling work as soon as I realise I'm ill, then a few months later have the flu and taking a couple of days off, again, telling them as early as I can, and then maybe a few months later getting another illness and taking a couple of days off. Those 3 periods of absence automatically put me on absence management. 

So in reality, I do **not** get 28 days entitlement (it's unpaid as well, in case anyone was wondering). As few as 3 separate days off can land me on the start of disciplinary procedures.

"My dog bit my cousin when he was young because he was petting her too roughly and she didn't like it.

She was just responding because he was hurting her and that was the only way that she knew how to stop him. 

I refused to yell at my dog because someone else was being a jerk, even if that's a kid. That's how kids learn not to fuck with animals. Plus, my cousin is really empathetic, he just didn't realize that he was freaking her out so he apologized to her and gave her a cookie. "

"'gays' lmao

well, i currently id as bisexual though i'm unsure if it's because i'm just too scared to label myself as lesbian. (not to insinuate that all bisexual folks do!) i definitely do lean towards liking girls tho - you could say i'm sexually attracted to everyone, but when i think of romance and a future, it's usually with a girl.

i was probably around 13-14. there was no singular moment, it just kinda happened - i went from being that one really aggressive ally to discovering who i was. i remember watching the end of 'but i'm a cheerleader!' and tearing up. also, the first time i kissed a girl, i felt so...validated? that was a really nice moment too.

to be fair, it's only later in life that u look back at ur early childhood-pre-teen memories and go 'shit that was gay'. 

anyway i'm probably never going to come out to family. part of me wishes i can just find a nice guy and settle down so i don't disappoint anyone. super conservative country!"

My unit went to Kuwait and after processing through the main camp near Kuwait City, we were trucked out to one of the border camps a few dozen kilometers from Iraq. Those camps have ""tents"" that are big 40-person affairs, with AC and light and everything, made of hardened canvas and foam or some shit idk. But even still it's a camp in the middle of a 120 degree desert miles from civilization.
So there's this kid who works in admin, and he bitches about everything. It's too hot (duh, you're deployed to the middle east dipshit), the walk is too far to the cafeteria (tough shit). But the kicker is when he came to me and complained to me (because I'd picked the tent and moved my squad and him and his ragtag section) because the wifi was slow. Fucking floored me. I just stood there and stared at him. Like bro you got in an Air Force plane and flew 14 hours and then drove another two hours into the middle of the desert and you complain because the wifi is slow? Fuck off.

Epilogue: he asked me if he could move to another tent (an empty tent) until they fixed the wifi. I told him sure I don't give a shit. Next day I go check on him and he's laying there all by himself in his empty tent playing a dumb phone game. Dude didn't even have kids or a wife to keep up with communication or anything.

"'Sour' beer is kind of a general, overarching term to describe a ton of different, unique beer styles. These beers span the spectrum in terms of flavor, ranging from bracingly acidic(warheads), to the subtle and complex cherry pit as it warms. 

Traditionally, these flavors are derived from the yeasts present during fermentation and the amount of time these yeasts are present. Most of the beers that people call sour are aged on oak.

Except right now there is a HUGE explosion of beers that are 'fast-soured' using a brewing technique called kettle souring. These beers mostly have a straight-forward sour component and lack the complexities present in a true sour that has seen some serious activity in its day. "

"Not OP but if it is alright to jump in the concept of ""toxic masculinity"" definitely isn't defining men as toxic (I'm not sure if you meant that or not by one of your lines, I'm not trying accuse I just want to start with that.)  I think there are toxic elements to both masculinity and femininity, though the toxic parts of femininity are more generally discussed and acknowledged in the general theory of what people know as feminism, so 'toxic femininity' doesn't get named as such.  There is nothing inherently bad about many things masculinity or femininity, only in the instances that society forces it.  Your experience of being strengthened by masculinity aren't invalid, but there are instances where social pressures of masculinity hurt boys and men.  For example, some boys really are stifled emotionally by the pressure to not express emotions, just as some girls are really hurt by the societal pressure on them to be quiet and feminine.  I think there are some elements of feminity and masculinity in our society that are inherently toxic- like the pressure on women to be beautiful and constantly on display, and the pressure on men to be aggressive and the whole concept of 'boys will be boys'.  But both things are toxic when they are forced upon people, instead of letting people naturally choose and develop their personalities and how they want to act.  "
I came here to see if anyone was complaining about me.
"Obviously too late but..

When I was still in high school, my bedroom at my mom's was the only one upstairs. Right next to my bedroom was a loft area and on the farthest wall from my room was a tv and the door to the guest bedroom. I would spend plenty of nights just sprawled out on the floor of the loft where I'd fall asleep watching tv.

One night, however, I was watching Friends on Nick@Nite and fell asleep. It was around 1 AM that I had passed out, and the two people who still lived there at the time (my mother and sister) were not home. My mom was out starting her paper route she did every sunday, and my sister spent the night at her boyfriends. I remember having very peculiar dreams that night; can't recall the details--likely due to the fear that followed their abrupt ending.

At 3:27 AM, the door to the guest bedroom about 4 feet from me SLAMS shut, so loud I wake up in a complete panic. Lights that were on when I fell asleep are now off and the TV in front of me is not on Nick@Nite. It's on an uncomfortably loud white fuzz. I sit in absolute shock for probably 30 seconds while I listen to try and hear what it is that just slammed that door shut. Part of me almost wants to cry out of fear. After nothing but the fuzz from the TV seems to be making any noise, I decide to get up and turn the lights back on. 

My heart is racing as I slowly approach the light switch, which is of course right next to the door that just flung closed. I flip it and immediately rush to the other side of the loft. The hairs on the back of my neck stand completely up as I hear the sound of creaks on the wooden floor of our kitchen downstairs.

""....MOM!?"" I mistakenly yell down the stairs. No response. At this point, it's all I can do to not lose my shit and I run straight to my bedroom and lock the door behind me. I call my mom who didn't answer and spend the next hour watching as many happy videos on youtube as I can while I try to just suppress all the fear that just overcame me. Haven't actually told anyone about this since and it wasn't until I saw this question that I remembered it even happened. Horribly scary, just writing this has me on edge.

(Also should note that I do not believe in spirits or ghosts or anything of that sort. I can't really explain this event, and it definitely had me questioning this disbelief for a moment.)"

She was super worried about losing her job, but shes good at it and never had a complaint so as long as she keeps it covered my lips are sealed. "

"No, there are reasons why both of them could still not be the nominee.  

If Hillary gets indicted then the DNC could go nuclear and just pick someone else, in which case I think they'll pick Biden, which would be a huge slap in the face to Bernie.

There are still some rumblings on the republican side about changes nomination rules and picking someone besides Trump. I think this is less likely than Hillary getting the boot if she is indicted.  

Also, Gary Johnson could play a spoiler role and prevent either one from getting enough electoral votes which would send the election to the house, at which point I bet Paul Ryan becomes President, but that's a long long long stretch.

Overall, odds are probably 95% it will be Trump or Hillary but there are some uncertainties."

"You came here not to discuss this, but I can see something you're missing.

Everyone knows you have to eat less. But eating less isn't easy for everyone. The person is not used to feeling hungry and it stressed them out, or they have a complex pattern of bad eating/sleeping/exercise habits that's hard to disentangle, or they forget their new habits, or they overeat to make them feel good when they're stressed. The list is endless.

The more you live your life a certain way, the more your brain lays down pathways that tie you to those habits and your behaviours become instinctive. You've obviously laid down healthy pathways that give good health results. Other people got it wrong and laid down unhealthy pathways that give them short term rewards but long term suffering, and it's really hard for them to change.

I'm labouring the point but there's one more thing. When you start a new habit you often discover that they bang up against other old habits in ways that you couldn't predict. You might decide to have salad for lunch forgetting that you go to Mum's on Sundays for lunch and she cooks for you. So on Sunday you wind up eating Mum's big fatty lunch, and her home made fudge. You've broken your habit. Now what do you do? Give up? Start again on Monday? Unless you sit down calmly and decide what to do, you'll probably make an impulsive decision and probably just decide that the habit didn't work.

What I'm saying is that healthy lifestyles are about healthy habits and healthy habits require a careful process of experimentation, monitoring and gradual adoption of new habits. This requires a set of good self-improvement habits that most people don't have to begin with.

Wow, that was long-winded. I can see why you don't like to talk about this.

One day this truck came up behind me and instead of going around, which would have been very easy for them to do, they slowed down and tailgated me. The driver kept revving its engine and honking the horn, at one point I became terrified he was going to hit my back tire so I swerved off the road into the ditch.   It wasn't the most graceful dismount, but the truck driver stopped and called me an asshole and then continued driving down the center of the road which, had he been doing in the first place, he would've been able to pass me without incident.

I went back two days later on Wednesday and they had completely decorated for Christmas, tree and all. No explanation. And it stayed that way until I finished working with the kid in June. "

Grounding meant no books, no art supplies, no computer, video games, TV, family events, friends, nothing except for doing yard or house work for my parents. If I talked back again, choked with a bar of soap, spanked, or food withheld. They would then ignore me until I apologized and did my chores. If I tried to hide in my room, they removed my door. They'd drag me down to the kitchen and make me sit in the corner, ignored, while everyone else ate.

"Because quite a number of years ago we developed the ability to communicate in complicated ways. 

So hunter gatherer Mark notices that more blueberry bushes grow around existing blueberry bushes. So he wonders why. Eventually he realizes that the blueberries that fall to the ground make NEW bushes. 

Hello agriculture. This information is passed on and then everyone has agriculture. Humans are still curious though. We know this works, what if we try it with other plants? Or, we know this works, what happens if we only plant the blueberries from the juiciest bushes? 

Agriculture progresses, knowledge is passed on, and people get curious about new things. 

Every bit of knowledge we gain can be shared with everyone. It elevates us all to the same platform, and from there we can try to build or climb to a higher platform. 

It's exponential though. The more we learn, the more possibilities there are, and at the same time the population is big enough that all possibilities can be explored. 

This is also why specialization is important today. It's no longer possible or necessary to know everything. Your time is better spent focused on one area you know you can contribute to. "

"I'm a lesbian and my best friend called me from college orientation last night. He and his roomate (for orientation) were discussing how worried they'd  be if they got a gay roomate, and how he'd  be uncomfortable and have to change roomates. It bothered them so much they decided to put each other as permanent roomates. 

He knows I'm gay but he will say stuff like ""Yeah but it's different with lesbians, I don't  have anything against gays but I can't be in the same dorm room as one. It's  against my religion!"" But he will never explain why. And when you tell guys like that that they would by far be the ones making a gay guy uncomfortable, and that just because they're guys doesn't make them automatically attractive to gay dudes, they get offended as fuck.

Very fristrating conversations with him about homosexuality. Many homophobes (and I think this applies to racists) don't even realize how they're  treating others because that's  the way they've  always thought, and it's normal to them. He and his roomate were absolutely shocked to see all the gay couples walking around on campus and I was just like ""Yeah, well..they walk around just like any other couple."" But of course they obsess over the gay couples.

"Not quite. There are many feminist philosophies, some of which oppose each other. ""Equity feminism"" is about ending discrimination in employment and education, improving representation in politics, etc. But some people would argue that those tactics don't really ensure equality; they might think that we need to break down capitalist systems (socialist feminism) or make changes to language and culture (postmodern feminism). And then there are others, like radical separatists or ecofeminists, who do not necessarily see in equality as their main goal."
"To be fair, if your first date move is to wine and dine the girl than you're sort of already sending the message that your wallet is a reason she should be attracted to you.

Casual, cheaper first dates are a lot better IMO because it helps know if the girl actually likes you for you, plus it's not as expensive and it doesn't result in any of those weird ""well he paid so much so I feel guilty not kissing him/having sex/agreeing to a second date even though I don't want to do it and shouldn't feel bad about not wanting to"" situations"

"What usually happens with me is that the girl eventually figures out that I pretty much only play video games in my free time, despite my best attempts to hide it. If the girl is still interested at this point, they usually competitively mention a video game they like, e.g. ""we should play Mario Kart, I'll kick your ass at that game."" The problem is that I don't like Mario Kart very much, so my only reply is ""uhh yeah sure you probably would... I play mostly PC games. Do you play any other games?"" ""not really, just Mario Kart with my brothers and the guys when I was in high school"" and then the (much appreciated) attempt to connect with me over video games is dead :("

Before the festival, after about a month of talking, i told him i would like to be in a relationship with him. He said long distance might be too hard so we should wait until the festival to decide if we are just as compatible in person as we are via the phone.

So the festival came and we instantly hit it off, we ended up sleeping together within like 3 hours of him getting me from the airport. And he ended up asking me to be his girlfriend that night, so it all worked out perfectly 😊"

A lot of women were raised for a long time to see this as a ""man's role"" - then by the time we realize that's not fair, not the way it SHOULD be, we haven't had any practice going out on a limb the way a lot of guys have been forced to, so we're super nervous about it! I used to tell myself I was letting guys approach me first bc their approach would tell me something about them (and a lot of guys can be SERIOUSLY off-putting right away, so it does weed out some jerks!), but one day I realized I just don't have the balls to approach someone who interests me!!

She asked us what was wrong with us, but when we asked her what she so strongly dislikes about Hillary she couldn't give one example. It's like she was just shit talking her because it's popular to hate Hillary Clinton and she assumed everyone around her felt that way because she did. She dominated the conversation all night, trying to draw attention to herself, telling my friend her hair looked better blonde and asking her when she was dying it back, picking up a dog repeatedly to coo at it even though it looked miserable with her. It was honestly hard to watch. She struck me as the ""popular in high school who's done nothing with her life"" type seeking validation."

"I don't want to comment on this sub specifically as I'm unfamiliar with it, but I wouldn't be surprised if something like this naturally tends towards having more women depicted by virtue of the fact that women are generally the ones who have to advertise criteria or get unwanted offers.

We have hundreds of stories from the last three years on the road, but I'm always hesitant to share them with the Reddit community, because of the whole ""don't talk about your acts of kindness, just do it in secret"" mentality.

And honestly, I agree that the best acts of kindness are done behind closed doors. But I have also seen how sharing stories can inspire someone else to make kindness a more regular practice in their life. What are your thoughts about this subject? "

"It's a great fantasy, but I hear it doesn't work out so well in real life..."
"A lot of people also don't think about getting a car IN THE FIRST PLACE. My parents never had a car to give me. We barely had a car that ran in the first place. My boyfriend when I was 18 didn't get it either. His parents gave him an old van. Then he'd ask why HE always had to drive to ME. Like, come on hun... I don't own a car. 

If you do buy a cheapo car from someone, it's going to have issues. No way around it. You will be stopping by the shop many times. Saving money to get a car is difficult.

Then the paycheck I was actually making when I lived alone was good for just me, on my own. But if I added car payments to that, and then car insurance, that would have broke me. Some months I only had 100 dollars slack. If something happened to put the car in the shop? 

Adding to that it kills your job flexibility. When can you work? When the bus runs. And to go to school and go to work while not having a car is virtually impossible in some places. 

People with cars make fun of me when I'd tell them I would walk home and to work some days cause I didn't have bus money and that it was literally 2 miles there and 2 miles back. They'd be like ""I walked 2 miles uphill both ways!!"" 

Even now, where I work and live in a city. I constantly get scrutiny from my job because I don't have a car. It's a set schedule, the same days and hours every week. I car pool with two different people, one of them has literally never called in sick and only took a day off once. They're like ""Well how do you know you can get to work reliably!?"" I already work here, why is this a question. "

"I don't know. It's 5 am and I probably should have been in bed 7 hours ago. 

I always appreciate a well formed response to something I say though. I would continue it, but I'm honestly tired. My big sticking points remain nuclear waste disposal; I keep bringing up Love Canal but not because it's the only example, just because I lived around that area. But also, people's incompetence in general. IE Fukishima not following regulations that obviously could have saved them, Chernobyl's flawed design in the first place, 3 mile Island was a human error, even SL-1 was human error. I just don't trust humans. But more importantly I don't trust companies. 

I think one thing that would happen is that companies currently involved with fossil fuels would change over to whatever the hot new item was. Do you really want BP who has way more spills than are even publicized to be in charge of nuclear material? But even if not BP, all companies cut corners and skirt the law because they can. And even when they have a commitment to not doing it, there's always an employee or boss who does. 

Edit: AND it's worth noting that companies already did cheap out and cause accidents so it's not like I'm being unwarranted in my paranoia. The government also did the same damn thing. So you can't trust either one, and you never should anyways (to an extent. I'm not saying be prepared to rebel. Just use caution.) And I guess I did continue. "

When we got a pair of boy kittens in 2006, Jiggy taught them to avoid the street in front of our house. They'd be playing with each other with Big Brother Jiggy watching over them, and when a car came he'd chase them back to our front porch. 

He also understands English. 

Right after the two male kittens got outdoor privileges (we lock them in at night,) we were ready to lock up but they were nowhere to be seen. We said to Jiggy, ""Where are the little boys? Go get your brothers."" He cocked his head at us and then vanished like a flash out the back (cat) door. About five minutes later, two annoyed, harassed-looking kittens came back inside followed by their big brother. My wife and I looked at each other and were ""did that just happen?"""

One time, I was doing fire poi for someone's birthday party. There was a lot of people at the party at this point, so it was getting close to a full house. Maybe 70 people there at that point. So I go to start doing my routine... (small backstory, I used to use the same rag to wipe away excess kerosene) as I was stringing with fire, my hands lit on fire! Let's just say that my head was not in the right place at the right time, so I didn't notice it until maybe about 10-15 seconds later. I quickly patted my hands on my midsection until they went out, and then continued stringing. As soon as I was done, everyone was cheering, applauding, and apparently not realizing that I had burned my hands. I looked down and turned my hands downwards to look at them - and my skin fell off. I literally watched the top of my hands' skin just fall off onto the ground. I walked quickly inside, where I ran to the bathroom and asked one of my friends I saw walking through the house to get me two glasses of water. When he came back, I sank both my hands into the glass, and then eventually got drove to the hospital with second degree burns all on the tops of my hands. I don't think many people at the party knew! I was a burned ninja that night."

"A group of friends were just hanging out in in a frat house when one of the fraternity brothers runs into the room drunk off his ass. He yells, ""I'm going to tickle your twat with my mohawk"" and then throws an unopened can of beer against/through the wall then proceeds to follow it ramming his head through the drywall. 

Same friend as another school. We severely underestimated the amount of alcohol needed for our gathering and ran out of beer just as it rocked past 2 am. So my friend and I decided to rob a kegger a couple houses down. The covert mission was by far the most serious I've undertaken in my life. 

We first scouted the house with an initial pass through saying we knew guy who owns the house. My friend, let's call him Jared, said the first thing that came to mind when we were stopped at the door, ""I know Carlos."" The girl at the door let us in. The keg was in the kitchen which could only be accessed through the living room and the back door to the house. Most of the party had spilled out to the front yard and only a few people remained in the living room. Once the kitchen cleared out we took to the plan. Me and another friend engaged in conversation with anyone who tried to go into the kitchen while Jared tried to steal the parties beer. 

The keg was too heavy to take by itself so he used a lot he found to fill. It took forever. Before he could finish filling it the girl who stopped us at the door she apparently didn't remember me because when I stepped up to stop her from going into the kitchen she asked me who I was and why I was here. I said I knew Carlos. She gave me a drunken, puzzled look and said no one named Carlos was at the party and pushed past me. 

When she saw Jared filling the pot she yelled that someone was stealing the beer and Jared ran out the back door. He missed his step when stepping onto the patio behind he house and beer sloshed up and over the rim of the pot. Like a slow motion movie a tidal wave of beer launched into the air and as he gained his footing he followed behind the wave with the pot collecting it all and not spilling a drop. Then, he took off down the back alley out of sight. The other friend and I slipped into the crowd outside and snuck back to the house. The beer was disgusting and I still have the pot. "

"If she is with another guy and doesn't have time for you,  you aren't the one she loves.  She loves herself, and she's using you a backup plan.  Intentional or not,  you deserve better and suffering for the idea of something that she doesn't want as much as you, will only bring you more pain.  I suggest taking some space,  don't cut her off but don't engage with her nearly as much.  If she seems to become a mess without you then confront her and see if she's willing to stop dicking you around. If she doesn't seem to notice then it'll hurt,  but you'll see how she really feels and can move on.  Sorry you're going through this.  "

Nor will I hold it against you or judge you. No way can I understand your circumstances and your frame of mind. I wish you the very best in life and health. I will be there for you if you need me.

Also there is the scenario where it is medically required due to severe medical problems or for the safety of the mother or child or in case of rape. Then it is completely hands off as far as I'm concerned. Of course, I would support it in these cases in any way necessary.

I remember in South Korea, people wearing or owning things so contradictory to the current trend got stares and occasional laughs in the public. Here, since there are so many choices, it's hard to even find yourself in comparable situations, but if I were to let's say get an Alienware laptop when all of my friends have Macbooks, my friends wouldn't say anything negative for getting something so unusual.

"My husband has been battling PTSD as a paramedic within the last few months (seeking treatment). The main call that bothers him is the following: 
A 20's male was driving home, drunk, from the wake of his best friend who had died in a small-plane crash. He tried to pass a vehicle and entered the wrong side of the road, a curved road, and struck a vehicle going 90mph. 
The girl driving the other vehicle was 17. My husband got on scene and firefighters were trying to get her out of the vehicle that was upside down. He said there was a puddle of blood underneath her, and he had to use his shears for the first time to cut through a seatbelt. She was so bloody that she slid down and he kept dropping her as he pulled her out of the vehicle. Her head was crinkly, he said she looked like a bloody angel, blond hair, her pupils were anisoscoric. There was a ride along that day who was crying on the side of the road. 
The part that haunts him, he said, is that he decided not to work her. He knew she was already dead, he knew if he got pulses back she would likely die or be in a vegetative state forever, but he was the head medic and no one else was there to call it but him... He said he'd wished someone in her family had been there to tell him to work it. 
Of course the drunk driver lived. 
When he got home I had to wash his uniform that was soaked in blood. "

* Same as above, but without being baked and no cheese. Equally as good, depends on my mood to have them go up and down.

* Hashbrowns, julienned. Similar method as the previous ones, but I typically don't include green peppers/onions.

* Baked potato from the night before. Cut it open, scoop out the innards, fry with butter/oil.

* Hashbrown patties you can buy in the store. Usually bake them for the first 15 minutes. Than pull out and give them a quick couple minutes in a pan.

* Tattertots, baked.

This helps keep your sinuses from drying out and gives you much better collection of dust and crap that's in the air. (It also gives you a good sized booger to clean out when you land.)

"I'm fairly certain my Grandfather may have touched me when I was little. Either so young I don't remember or I blocked it out. Reading this brought... something back to me. I think I was maybe about 10 and he was trying to give me a hug and I was running away from him, and I remember being genuinely scared. He got really shitty with me and wouldn't speak to me for a long time. 

Then I remember walking up the stairs and him GRABBING my ass (I think I was 12/13) and telling him ""Can you NOT grab my ass?"" in a typical teenage sulky way, to then be ranted at that he was not ""grabbing"" my ass and that I needed to learn to use words correctly before I got someone in trouble. Again, he didn't speak to me for a while.

Thinking about this is making me angry now. Like, how dare he decide how I feel I was or wasn't touched? How dare he get angry with me for not wanting him to touch me? 

Oh Christ, another memory. I was 16 I think? Bumped into him up town, we were going the same way - up an alleyway. I motioned for him to go first, and he let me go first ""Just so I can look at your ass.""

voiceover
"I went to a university with a bunch of kids that had super-wealthy parents, which often led to some interesting problems of cluelessness.

One girl in particular had never had the need to cook or even use a microwave for herself before going to college.... so when she went to cook her can of soup in the microwave (yes the whole unopened can) it caught the microwave on fire and resulted the entire kitchen being unusable for a ~~year~~ semester.

That's not the real story, but it is where the fun begins.

Luckily, by the next semester they had the kitchen up and running again, just in time for another girl to catch the kitchen on fire by trying to cook a bag of popcorn on an electric burner.  She turned on the burner, saw it wasn't doing anything, and walked away assuming it would take a few minutes.  The kitchen fared a little better this time... as the microwave and sink survived - but we had no stove or cabinets for several weeks.

But, that particular girl wasn't done yet.  She would go to wash her clothes in the dorm laundromat , and all the machines would be busy... so she would take the other peoples clothes out, toss them on the floor and proceed to do her own laundry - because she was obviously more important than they were (this led to a hilarious encounter where on particular student had had enough of her shit, and filled her laundry loads with bleach.... lots and lots of bleach... ruining almost all of her clothes).  She also parked regularly in the handicap spots and complained about unfair treatment when her car ended up getting booted for unpaid tickets (she thought they were beneath her).  Eventually she got academically dismissed, and tried to appeal the decision (she had below a 1.0 GPA at this point) - she appealed the ruling to a committee which ruled on 'special circumstances' (like deaths in the family, medical issues, etc.) and her entire premise was that she should not only be re-instated but that she should receive passing grades for all her classes automatically because her family was wealthy and paying full tuition for her to attend. Luckily thee university was not sympathetic to her and refused her appeal.  

The only reason we came know this.... is she was so pissed at the school for their decision, that she shared her story with the school newspaper believing that she had been wronged by the university."

But there's something really strange that I can't wrap my head around. A genuine warning here: reading this might adversely affect your health some day.

Vitamin C to get over a cold more quickly is one of those really interesting cases where there is a commonly held belief in something that has no scientific backing. But placebo effects are real. Believing that something works actually does have a significant and measurable impact on both perceived symptoms and actual remission of whatever it might be we're talking about. So when my coworker starts popping Vitamin C to 'boost [her] immune system', even though I know it's pseudoscience, I have no idea what to say. I've taken to just smiling and saying nothing at all. 

Some day that placebo effect might genuinely impact her in some real way, and even if I did manage to convince her that XYZ thing doesn't actually impact health, I might just be hurting her.

The same is true of a friend who had a potentially malignant mass and who started taking homeopathic remedies. Do I try and fight a battle of misinformation that is very hard to fight, while risking a potential and real harm to this person? Or do I hope that placebo effects are as impactful as I know they can be, or that it turns out to be benign anyway?

I don't know.

Misinformation is a powerful and negative force on the world. But maybe our version of the truth can be too sometimes.

"Sort of off topic, but my wife is Mexican and we were visiting family recently in Mexico.  I got into the history and am now reading some books on it.  The ""defer to authority"" thing was strong even before the church, the Aztecs and the people before them all discouraged independant thinking or questioning authority and enforced this very rigidly.  It makes sense why so many Mexicans don't cause a stir even though the rich just fleece them and abuse them all over the place."
"I think he just see's some big number and assumes it well never go down, ever. At the end of the day it's the clients money and they can do what they want with it, but a $200k trip when you make 750k is like 40-50% of your take home. I don't know his tax situation as he uses an outside guy and not our team to do all that (I'm probably glad a i don't), even being conservative he's probably paying at least 40% in total taxes.... 

$750k a year is a shit load of money, but guys I know who make in the low 7 figures don't spend nearly what he does. I've found that people tend to spend a set certain percentage of their income regardless of what it is. Make $10k a month, then you spend $8k a month. 20 years later you're making $100k a month, good chance your probably spending $80k a month. 

Sad thing is for a lot of people, that extra spending doesn't go to things like a house, or property, it's usually on trips, entertainment, clothes, cars, jewlrey, etc. You can probably buy a million dollar house making $300k a year, when you make $750k a year though you might not want a bigger house, so you will just find somewhere else to spend it."

"Ehhh... My brother had 4 nieces and a nephew in his wedding as flower girls and ring bearer. They were given skittles as encouragement and there were a few hiccups getting them down the aisle but in the end they were very cute and well behaved. Then, they all got to go back to their hotel with a nanny while the moms and dads enjoyed a child-free reception. So you can have both! Kind of.

As someone who was a flower girl 12 times by the age of 13 (and the last one I was promoted to ""junior bridesmaid"" due to my age lol), it's definitely something those kids will remember, and will teach them some proper etiquette too! Having them be a part of the ceremony will make them feel included and there's less acting out for attention since they're getting so much already. It won't be perfect, of course. My first trip down the aisle I was 3 and I got tired of tossing the petals from the basket so I just dumped the whole thing out about halfway up the aisle. People thought it was hilarious, though, and may have cut any tension or nerves that people were having. I've never been to a wedding that was interrupted by kids, especially if they have parents or other adults in charge of them and can take them out of the ceremony if necessary. Something is bound to happen during the ceremony that isn't as planned, might as well be a little kid doing something silly and making everyone smile. My oldest brother didn't want me as a flower girl (I was 9, was invited to the wedding and was a veteran flower girl at that point so you can bet I wasn't going to make a scene). They had an incredibly formal wedding in a Cathedral and the bride's father stepped on her train and ripped her dress during the processional.

Not telling you what to do at all, just saying that weddings are crazy and if your wife wants flower girls, it won't necessarily ruin your wedding. Just make sure there is an adult or two that is in charge of wrangling them during the parts of the ceremony they're not involved in and know that they can be at the ceremony but not at the reception. Good luck!!"

She calls me up at 17 years old, bawling her eyes out, because she was pregnant, and couldn't understand how, cause she had never had an orgasm before. 

Thankfully she's a smart lady and realized the place she grew up had wronged her. Moved in to the city, put her own kid in foster care for a bit (after many, many chats with me as the idea horrified her but she didn't know what else to do), got a diploma, started working in social services herself, got her son back, met a nice man, and had 3 more kids. She's a very happy momma today :) "

Any chef worth a damn should be able to meet a challenge, rather than just serve up ""a few slices of grilled eggplant and zucchini"". If that's all you can manage, you're a shitty chef.

&gt; To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living. 

I feel sorry for anyone who genuinely thinks this. If your life is only made worthwhile by a very narrow range of foodstuff, then you live a very sad life.

&gt; Vegetarians are the enemy of everything good and decent in the human spirit, an affront to all I stand for, the pure enjoyment of food. The body, these waterheads imagine, is a temple that should not be polluted by animal protein.

What a complete strawman of an argument. I don't care about ""polluting"" my body, I care about the needless suffering and death of sentient creatures. I care about shit like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArL5YjaL5U), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wwq4u3fSEkg). The fact that Bourdain makes it about the individual person shows that he completely misses the point.

&gt; It's healthier, they insist, though every vegetarian waiter I've worked with is brought down by any rumor of a cold. 

My experience has been the opposite; working with a group of non-vegans and I was frequently the only one to **not** get sick. Of course, just like Bordain's (made up) story this is just anecdote, which doesn't make for good evidence.

As for anyone who actually thinks that Bordain makes a good argument, it really shows a lack of critical faculties. The desire to be able to continue doing something, while pretending it's not only harmless, but actually good, leads people to accept something that they would never accept if it opposed their viewpoint."

Electrocute their genitals and breasts. Rape them vaginally and analy with various medical instruments. Had a rack of sorts that he would pull out, tie them up to, and invite friends over to watch as they got their dog to rape the girls (he liked how the dogs would knot up and get stuck).

"Short version: animals are conscious, plants are not.

Long version:

The moral value of life is more-or-less defined by consciousness, the ability to be aware of emotions and/or feelings and/or sensations. There is no way to test for or be certain of consciousness in any being or object besides oneself. *However*, because other humans all seem to function the same as us, we assume for simplicity's sake that they are conscious.

Now, we can't actually be sure where consciousness is coming from. But it seems to be in the head, and the brain is what controls the body. As such, we assume that consciousness originates from the brain, since it seems to make the most sense.

As a result of this, we treat it as given that where there is brain activity, there is consciousness. This is not certain, but makes the most logical sense. Therefore, since animals have brain function, we assume they are in fact conscious. We tend to believe they are *less* conscious, since they have less brainpower, and this is how we justify consuming them. However, plants have very little, if anything, that can be called brain activity. As such, it is highly improbable they can experience conscious thought, which makes it extremely easy to justify our sustenance over their lives.

I want to clarify that I am not trying to make any point here, for or against any moral conclusion. Just here to provide the relevant philosophical arguments."

"It's not necessarily a rule, but I am the cause of a spike strip installation.  
I have a friend that lives in a gated community. It's all posh, and fancy, with the walls, gate guards, gates, the whole 9 yards. The problem was that there are like, 5 different gates, and the guard changes post throughout the day, and you can't get in w/o a gate guard if you don't live in the community. Eventually I got sick of finding where the gate guard was posted, so I just sat outside the in and the out gates, in the middle where they allow you to make U-turns to escape, and waited for a car to leave. This happened frequently. When a car left, the gate would be open for about 5-10 seconds after a car left. This is where I just gassed it need for speed style and nyoomed through the going out gate. After about the 6th or 7th time, I couldn't do it any more because they just installed spike strips to guard the going out gate. Those little ones that only face one way and when you go over them the right way the get pushed down but don't if you go the wrong way[(Looks like this but actually in the ground, not on top)](http://perimetersecurityproducts.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Tire-Shredder.jpg). I actually had to find and talk to the gate guard from that day on. Never got confronted or anything about it despite them having cameras.  
  
  
TL;DR - Didn't feel like going in the gate the right way, went in the out, the authority didn't like that, spike strip installed."

"When I bought my first LCD HD TV at costco, they had a 1 year return policy for defects, no questions asked, full refund.

I had purchased a 37"" 1080p Sceptre for $2500 when 1080p LCD TV's were first coming out.  I had it for 10 months and MUCH MUCH better ones were out, so I started to see if I could break it via a defect (e.g. not physically breaking but seeing if I could do something accidentally anyone could do that would cause it to break).

I stuck the HDMI cord in the service port (about the same size and right beside the hdmi port) and sure enough, it shorted out and broke.

I returned it, got my $2500 back.

I purchased a larger, MUCH NICER, 42"" Vizio for $1600, Then I had $900 on a costco card and bought video games, tons of food, and milked that cash card for a long time.

Later did the same thing on the vizio, but this one legitally broke.  But only made out with about $200 back that time as prices had dropped much less drastically.

"ah, good old DnD rules. One time had a guy who would summon temporary pets and sell them for a lot of money. Since he had really good charisma he'd get away with it 90% of the time, plus he was in alteration so he would change his appearance and no one would know he did it. DM decided there were now mage police who ride magic flying dolphins that tracked him down.

Also from the same guy, there is a rule you are now no longer allowed to commit crimes while looking like Dan, who was at one point banned from every major city in our campaign.

We also had someone who read waaay too much into NPC's and how fast they could may certain items, and basically owned a giant ""farm"" with around 200 npc's making him different assorted items he deemed were good value (this happened slowly over like 3 campaigns). He ended up having so much money he we forced him to spend it all on rope, (which was like 200,000 ft) and had a natural disaster wipe out all the NPC's.

Only rule we had that was based off something I did, was one time I made a character and rolled a 3 (only time I ever saw this), I put it in intelligence, and chose a class with -1 int. I was the same int as a horse, and was basically unable to RP because I couldn't make any decisions on my own.

The DM forced me to re-roll my stats after 1 campaign because I was so stupid everything revolved around trying to get me to not fuck everything up, since I didn't know better."

My school implemented a rule where each laptop had to be checked before and after lessons and a note had to be made of which student was using which number laptop which took up a lot of time.

Once I was alone as the closing manager of a county pool, and I was backwashing a sand pump, which is where you use the pool(in this case hot tub) pumps to reverse the flow of the water, into the pump, normally the water goes out into the waste. Problem  was I forgot to open up the waste valve, so the 400 gallon sand filter popped like an over inflated balloon. Sounded like a cannon going off, thankfully I wasn't in the room, came in the room to a tower of water shooting out of the half of the pump that remained.

Several years later I worked at a car dealership and sold a nice doctor lady an Avalon Hybrid, first deal I did all by myself. She drove away happy and I left for the day. Few minutes after getting home I get a phone call, it's my hard assed boss informing me in a heavy french accent that I didn't put the tags on the car. She got pulled over and handcuffed.

It turned into a huge thing with her dad and this guy with their faces inches from each other about to fight and the guy was like, ""How dare you let your kids play in my lawn"" or something. We weren't allowed to go back there again :'("

As someone who leans really far left/radical, I don't think this is the case. Most democrat leaders are rather moderate, and most liberal talking heads are more centrist than Fox News would have you believe.

That's what getting rid of privilege *is!* It's treating people equally, so no one is privileged above another based on who they are.

And how you go about not having it is by movements like the civil rights movement, gay pride, feminism, etc. You point privilege out when you see it, research why it happens, explain why it's wrong, and slowly, bit by bit, the culture changes. It happens through actions on both sides of the privilege line, by people standing up for their own rights and standing up for the rights of others. "

"Which is always doomed for failure. If your happiness depends on anything outside of your own opinions then that will break eventually. 

As Epictetus says:


""Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions. 

The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed. 

Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards the attainment of lesser things. Instead, you must entirely quit some things and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both have these great things, along with power and riches, then you will not gain even the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom are achieved. 

Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, ""You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be."" And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this: whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.""

"Summary: Somewhat normal couple's house get replaced by full scale meth house.

We moved into our beautiful house in an up-and-coming neighborhood around 8 and a half years ago. We had been paying attention to the area over the years and had noticed that it was getting better. That, coupled with the fact that we could get about 1.5 times the quality of house that you could get in other areas for the same price was a reason to take a gamble on it.

The first few years were fine, the neighbors were brash and a little rowdy after a few beers, but they seemed like a reasonably normal couple. The father, Bill, was a painter. He worked hard and partied harder. He was the drummer in a motorhead cover band, and every friday the band would get together in the garage, drink excessively and practice until well after midnight. The whole neighborhood basically had an agreement to not call the cops to complain about the noise under the unsaid understanding that it only happened on friday nights, and rarely would they play past midnight.

The mother, Kelly, was a stay-at-home mom who sometimes moonlit at a grocery store in the deli. She had substance abuse issues in her past, but that seemed to now be only a memory, she now had two kids and she seemed to understand that being a responsible parent was a thing of great importance in her kid's lives.

As the years went by, the kids starting showing signs of having issues. The youngest boy, at around 4 or 5 years seemed to start have anger issues. He would often blow up and get very angry just out of the blue. And he would also often urinate in front of people. Yes urinate, he would be standing right next to you, and we would pull down his pants and urinate, right there. Sometimes he would have the courtesy of edging up to a fence or a building, but sometimes he wouldn't. I'm sure it was a habit he learned from his father, because after too many beers his father would do the same thing.

The daughter who was a about 8 when we first moved in, Macy, also started showing signs of having troubles when she became 12 or 13. She did the normal teenage stuff, dyed her hair, nose piercing, and I think a tatoo or two, but she also started coming home super late on school nights, and being dropped off at her house by sketchy looking guys that looked like they were around 17 or 18 years old. She was smoking cigarettes, and would sometimes come home looking like she had was on the tail end of some kind of alcohol or drug induced bender.

A few years in we started noticing signs of issues with the neighbors. Bill, who had at first seemed like an affable happy drunk, suddenly seemed like he would get very angry after a few drinks. We would hear him yelling at his friends, or his kids, and once in a while we would hear Bill and Kelly having a full out shouting match with each other. I won't get into the details of what was said, but let's just say that most people would consider the things that were said to be marriage enders.

They hung on another year though, fighting more and more frequently, and at some point Bill just left and didn't come back. I think he took his son with him, and I think that Macy went to live with a relative.

Kelly was alone by herself in the house. Nobody was making mortgage payments, and I think she felt very isolated. She returned to her substance abuse, heavy drinking and drugs. A few months after Bill had left the house, Kelly found a boyfriend. I think she met him at a local bar. Soon after he moved into her house with her, and I think he was helping to make the mortgage payments.

In about a months time, we started seeing more and more people come to the house. There were many street people, but the concerning part was that there was a gang element that seemed to 
be frequenting the house. People starting coming and going at all times of the day and night. Apparently her new boyfriend was involved with a local gang.

We knew that we had a full scale problem when we saw a man come up to the house, negotiate with someone at the front door, and then minutes later take a girl from the house out to his vehicle where the girl performed services on the man in the back seat of his family SUV.

We called the police, many neighbors also joined in and called as well, soon the police were frequenting the place and patrolling the neighborhood. This did little or nothing to prevent the problem, and things still continued to escalate.

Drug runners on bicycles began coming and going from the house at all hours of the night. 

Fights would frequently break out on their front lawn over money owing, or drugs owing. Twice we saw someone getting beat up by 4 or more gang members in the street outside of the house. 
I came home once to see 3 guys sitting on the front lawn roasting wieners over a campfire built from a table I recognized as being Bill and Kelly's kitchen table. People were openly smoking meth from glass pipes on the back porch.

We would see Kelly once in a while, not often, and usually when we saw her she looked completely strung out on something, and her entourage would quickly shuffle her back into the house.

My wife and I got a call while we were taking our yearly vacation from one of our other next door neighbors, Jim, he wanted to know if I had asked anyone to remove our hot tub cover. I said definitely not. Apparently someone who was now living next door decided that it would make a good sleeping surface and stole it. Jim and some other neighbors went over and demanded that they give it back, it was returned to us a little worse for wear but intact.

The police raided the place twice, the first time they raided it they apparently levelled 107 charges against the home owner and the people inside, and they put a few people in jail and found numerous firearms, drugs and other illegal paraphanelia.

At some point a biker gang decided to take over the house, and instead of being run by a local gang, this new gang seemed more organized, however the local gang was unhappy with being kicked out of the house.

We saw Kelly less and less, and at some point we saw her on the corner a few blocks away selling herself.

The turning point in this story comes at about 3am on a cold february morning. I had looked out the backyard and saw an ominous figure leaving the next door neighbors garage, but this was not anything new, it was a common thing to see. 

I was preparing my luggage to leave on a flight to florida to go see some baseball spring training games. My wife was helping me pack, and suddenly, she starts to scream ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD"". She's pointing out the back window unable to speak. The neighbors garage was consumed in a full scale inferno. Flames were already busting out of the roof of the garage when I dialed 911. The fire department got there quick, and were able to put the fire out without any damage to our property. Presumably the gang that was ousted from the property came back to get retribution.

At that point the bank forclosed on the property and boarded it up, for a few weeks after this we had people coming and going trying to get into the house with pry bars. We had people knocking on our door asking where this person was or that person was. 
They didnt demolish the burnt out garage right away, so it stood there, a burnt out shell, for close to 6 months. A bunch of people starting piling up garbage outside the house, mattresses, furniture, general garbage. It became a real problem, until finally one day while I was at work a fire started in the pile of garbage, and it burned down what remained of the garage, a large portion of 
our fence, our shed, and a portion of our garage. The fireman was kind enough to bust down the door of my garage and save my corvette, I am thankful to him for that.

After this the bank finally demolished the burnt up garage and cleaned it up, insurance covered the damage to our garage and fence. Now we simply live next to a hollowed out, boarded up shell of a house.

"Computer Scientist here.

I believe what u/Thenatic wrote about Automation, along with several other people commenting on the subject including the highly respected u/MindOfMetalAndWheels, is plain wrong. I was involved in a year's research as part of my MSc into web dev, and worked in industry for the last 2 years.

We have a fundamental issue with our subject, that is P =? NP. It's a bit too complicated for me to explain given that this post will probably get buried, but it lies at the very foundation of our field. And we don't know if it's true or not. That's right, it's not that P = NP or P =/= NP, it's **P = we have no fucking idea**. The consensus opinion is leaning towards *P != NP*, which sucks because this means that some computational problems like the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) cannot be solved in any reasonable time when the amount of items is large. Now imagine something like a delivery service or a self-driving car. How does the system crunch millions of different variables at a time in the real world, when it can't even compute the most optimal route to deliver packages properly? Worst of all, how does it take into account the most irrational thing in day to day life - **humans**?

So how do we do it usually?

Brute force. Yep, that's right, it's simply easier to smash a problem with the raw power of our distributed CPU systems, map-reduce, etc. That's why quantum computing is seen as the future - because the power increases will be huge. I haven't done anything to do with Machine Learning or AI in 5 years, but back then everything was incredibly simplistic and more akin to brute forcing things (i.e assuming we have infinite memory) and I believe it still is now, and will be for a very very long time.

EDIT: And also self-writing code? Please. I did model driven engineering as part of my MSc and saw it for real in my first year of my grad progam. It is dogshit. Either we suck at explaining to the computer what we want such that it's much easier for developers to write their own code, or the computer itself doesn't take into account the many nuances of a programming language properly. Either way, I ended up re-writing a lot of garbage auto-generated code for a few months during my first job."

It's inherently a more sexual display than breastfeeding, which is in a non-sexual environment for their non-sexual purpose.

Also do you eat in a public bathroom or go to a car every time you eat, even if you're sitting in a restaurant? No, no one does so it's unfair for a mother to move to feed her child. Not to mention eating in a public bathroom is really gross and degrading."

She's very strong but sometimes it just gets to her. She mentioned a while ago during times like that, she has a bunch of motivational quotes she looks at to pick her up. But i imagine looking at the same quotes too many times will make them lose their effect. 

She was pretty depressed the other day about not getting a job she really wanted. We think it was due to her condition. So I came home that day and made a folder full of motivational quotes, paired with stupid pictures of dogs. The idea is when she's down, she can look through that book and have the pictures to make her laugh, and the quotes for strength. I feel powerless when she's having a fit and I can't do a damn thing to help my friend. I hate it. So I think this is a direct way I can help her. I'm very pleased with it. In a way, it's pretty cringey. It feels like I'm making her a mix tape of songs in the 90's, but it's something that will genuinely help her, so we can deal with the cringe. "

"The Tories are pretty much the same thing as the Conservatives, it's kinda like a more old fashioned name for them. David Cameron and Boris Johnson are both Conservatives, remember you don't have to believe in the exact same things to be in the same party. For example David Cameron wanted to Remain in the EU and Boris Johnson wanted to Leave. The Conservatives are right-wing, in terms of what they stand for may seem debatable but generally they appeal to middle-class citizens and upper-class citizens as well. 

Farage is a member of UKIP, That is the United Kingdom Independence Party. UKIP is a far-right party, which means they tend to be more nationalist, oppose things like mass-immigration, stuff like that. (FYI that doesn't make them xenophobic) Being right-wing you'd think they would appeal to middle and upper class citizens but recently working class citizens have began to support UKIP because UKIP focuses on immigration, immigration tends to affect the working class people more than anyone else. AKA the popular phrase 'They're taking our jobs.' Because of lots of Polish and Eastern European people coming over to low income areas and picking up jobs so that they can send money back to their families. That sort of thing. 

Jeremy Corbyn is the head of the Labour party. Labour are left wing and tend to appeal to working-class citizens (hence the name 'Labour') They usually focus on giving the working-class a better life by raising the minimum wage, rejuvenating old mining towns that sort of stuff. Jeremy Corbyn is opposed to Leaving the EU, however during the campaigns leading up to the referendum, he seemed to do very little. It's widely believed that he should have reached out to his voters to vote Remain, and as it seems that he failed to do this, a lot of his party want him out. But he's refusing to do so at the moment. He's basically lost his supporters kinda like that, as I said working-class folk bare the brunt of immigration and that seems to be a big reason why many voted Leave (of course there are other reasons for voting leave but I wont get into that because that isn't what you asked for).

There are a bunch of other parties as well like the Lib Dems who are sort of in the middle between right and left wing. They sorta want a fully democratic society and they push this by trying to appeal to both sides of the political section. 

Then there's the Greens who are really focused on the Environment and a lot of their policies are based around that. They are left wing and don't get many voters because it seems they lack understanding of many other issues like poverty etc. They wanted to vote remain in the EU referendum because it's better for the environment...supposedly. They are difficult to understand.

Anyway I kinda went on a bit, but there's a rundown of the main parties and what's going on right now."

"No. Plenty of primary sources cite other articles on the same topic. All research is based on other research. I'll write an article that's the primary source for *my* research, but it will cite other articles including reviews that would be more appropriate for background on the subject as a whole. Otherwise I need to reinvent the entire wheel each time I publish and that doesn't make any sense. 

In other words basically everything wikipedia cites should itself have many citations, otherwise whoever wrote the paper didn't do their job.

Of course in some cases primary sources such as letters etc. make sense and those obviously don't have citations. 

But it doesn't make any sense for wikipedia to only cite those, and in fact I think it makes more sense for wikipedia to *not* cite those. 

 In many (most?) cases the primary sources are dense and difficult to impossible to interpret for non-experts. Even experts argue all the time about interpretation of various forms of data. It should not be the case that wikipedia contributors write their own interpretation based on the primary source; they should present the major interpretation(s) by the experts and cite the papers where those interpretations appear. 

In addition, I think of wikipedia more as a ""review of reviews"" - wikipedia should be the top level, with its sources being more in depth reviews of the material, and *those* sources will themselves cite both reviews and primary articles. The rabbit hole is deep as well as wide. 

Of course this all works a lot better if the high-quality papers that wikipedia should be citing were available publicly. Which, for the most part they're *not*... I do not like that so much knowledge is locked behind a paywall. "

"The people that lived behind us were straight up hillbillies. At any given time there were at least five adults and three children living in a three-bedroom house. There were at least twice that many dogs living in the house. When I first moved into my house I noticed that two of the kids were close in age to my step kids so I invited them over just to hang out with all of us. I quickly learned that they were just way too weird and I didn't want them around my step kids.

The mom of one of the kids constantly would sit out in the backyard even on the hottest days and just scream at everyone else in the family when she needed something. The youngest boy would wander around the neighborhood carrying  a machete.  When their dogs need to go to the bathroom they would just open the door and let the dogs out even though they didn't have a fence so the dogs felt free to roam in any yard to do their business. Luckily I had a fence but my other neighbors did not.  One day we looked out our window and noticed that they were building something beside their house. Come to find out they were building an apartment complex in their average sized family home lot. As you might imagine they had no permits and had no idea what they were doing. When I moved away from that place they had built a floor and some of the walls and then just covered everything with plastic."

The second piece is trickier.

And that's: know your audience.

I'll explain. So if you are introvert and you want to meet like minded people, you will likely do well to meet a fellow introvert. So you find things that interest you (ideally, other introverts as well), and attend. 

Now, ask yourself - would you likely be confident, daring and gregarious enough to ask someone out upon first meeting (or even worse, on event 5 of 9, knowing things could go wrong and you'd have to see them again or give up the class and *you're just starting to like*...)

Probably not. And neither is that introvert you kinda like.

So you *may* have to make the first move. And possibly the 2nd or 3rd. You don't have to be forward, just try not to be coy.

Ex - you don't have to ask him on a date, but it'd do well to say something like would you be interested in hanging out, outside of {event} some time? Cool! See if you can find (thing you are already pretty sure you both like) and I'll be sure to take off (clear schedule) that day! 

That let's him know you're interested, and puts the ball in his court to help build his confidence :)"

"Date a woman or 2 who's a branch or 2 below your typical standards.  Get used to the ritual of having a date while feeling no pressure of the consequence of your actions or words, just being your relaxed self.  The first time I did this the girl invited me to come inside her place after dropping her off.  This was a wake up call, people like me when I'm relaxed and internally didn't care that much.  Anyway, do this a couple times.  This gets the stink of failure off you real quick.  Then when you finally date a girl you actually want, it'll be more routine and relaxed and you'll know for a fact, in the back of your mind, that there have been women who enjoyed your company doing this exact same thing.  And you can take on the mental frame of letting her do the worrying instead of the other way around.  And if you perfect this and are able to be yourself and she just isn't into you for one reason or another, you just saved yourself a lot of trouble and can quickly move on to finding someone else who is.  It's always a win / win situation because you have nothing to lose.  There's also an irrational urge to brag or humble brag when you're around someone who you want to like you.  You gotta give that kind of behavior the axe.  Confident people don't need to say shit about their accomplishments, their actions and behavior speak for themselves without you needing to articulate it.  If you're ever catching yourself talking yourself up with the goal of impressing, know that you're just annoying the shit out of everyone.  No one gives a flying fuck,  if they ask you a specific question related to that, it's ok, but don't bring that shit up out of the blue, you should be focused on finding out information about her, not telling her about you so much.  If you ask people to recall their favorite date, if you analyzed it closely, it probably involved their date being genuinely interested in them and asking them fun questions about themself.  The opposite, if you asked people to recall their worst date, it would involve sitting across from someone who only talked about themself.  If you're not used to being interested in someone else's life or hobbies, start practicing with people around you and who you work with.  It's a good trait to build if you don't already have it.  "

The newer generations of  socially liberal leaning Americans who support things like same-sex marriage, trans inclusiveness and pro-choice rights have really, really upset the religiously motivated right and the ignorant right. 

Just to be clear, btw, I'm not calling *all* republicans ignorant by any means when I say ignorant right. By ignorant right I mean I believe there is an enclave of people within republicans who are homophobic, sexist, racist etc for no reason other than dislike. 

So when Trump makes these really obnoxious and offensive statements I don't think he as a person stands by what he says. He may share the sentiment in some ways but he's being so offensive to grab the attention of the anti-PC Americans. Like he I'm sure does believe what he says about immigration but when he says illegal immigrants are rapists that's him trolling for anti-PC attention. I believe if elected we'll see that Trump doesn't pursue the extreme social measures he is promising now. He's just trying to get the votes.

Now as far as his non-social issues I think it's probably fairly genuine. I am admittedly (and probably obvious to anyone reading at this point a liberal) however my dad is a conservative republican and is voting for Trump. He even believes he's a troll, but agrees with his non-social issues. I think that's how a lot of republicans who are closet Trump supporters feel too. "

"Although mass shootings play well for media ratings, the truth is that they account for so few deaths as to be significantly insignificant.  You do live in a country of 300 million people, and far more people die from much more innocuous causes.

For a little perspective, around 3,500 people die every year from drowning, around 330 of which specifically drown from falling out of a boat.  Let's take a really bad year from [the full set of Mother Jones data](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data), like 2007.  That year, the shootings they selected counted for 54 fatalities (tied with 2012).  That means you were almost 68 times more likely to die from falling out of a boat than from dying in a mass shooting.  

What about things that are *actually* common?  The CDC estimates that every year 610,000 people die from heart disease.  That means you are 11,296 times more likely to die from heart problems than you are getting killed in a mass shooting.  Overall, there are 2.6 millions deaths in the US every year, which means that even in an exceptional year mass shootings account for .002% of deaths.

I also did notice that the article you linked actually had a pretty reasonable paragraph at the end:

&gt;Though we now know that public mass shootings have been occurring more often, the reasons why have yet to be identified. However we come to understand the complex factors that drive these events, it is unlikely that this recent shift is the result of social and cultural factors that have remained relatively constant over the past decade—such as the prevalence of mental illness. While many mass shooters had mental-health problems, as the Mother Jones data shows, there is no reason to believe that there has been an increase in mental illness rates in the last several years that could help explain the rise in mass shootings. (In fact, federal research on the prevalence of severe mental illness shows a decrease in recent years.) As we search for answers with the common goal of diminishing mass shootings, studying them effectively remains key, not least for gauging the success of any policies aimed at reducing the frequency and toll of these events.

In other words, people who think we should enact stronger gun control based on mass shootings are blowing their statistical significance *way* (like embarrassingly badly) out of perspective, and they are trying to make sweeping legislation based on something we still don't entirely understand.

Even if you aren't a gun owner yourself, millions of law-abiding Americans are.  If your feelings become law, you can turn them all into criminals with the stroke of a pen.  You're talking about real peoples' personal rights."

My concern is that demagogues usually take advantage of a very real problem with a nation. They don't stand a chance of getting elected when everything is fine. You need to combine the emotion and scapegoating with an ounce of truth for it to work.  

Problem is, a demagogue's solutions usually aren't very deep or analytical. Once you get past the surface, everything falls apart. And if you point out that it's just a facade, you get blamed for being an other who's simply out to victimize the demagogue and his supporters.

"I remember one gentleman in particular.

It was my second year as a paramedic, and I had fallen comfortably into what role I took in the lives of strangers.

One afternoon we were called to a gentleman with chest pain. He was camping with his family, during a holiday weekend. When we arrived, he was looking...not so great. As a medical provider, you develop this ability to look at someone, and within seconds can get a decent idea as to whether they're ""sick"" or ""not sick"". I looked at him and immediately thought, he's ""SICK"".

I put him on the cardiac monitor, and took a 12-lead ECG; it showed that he was experiencing a rather large heart attack. We put him in the ambulance and did the standard treatment whilst we expedited to the hospital. About 3 minutes from the hospital, he looked at me and said ""please, don't let me die"". 

I assured him that we would take good care of him, and tried to allay any fear that he had. Unfortunately, moments later, he went into cardiac arrest. The firefighter and I started our resuscitation, and continued our efforts until we handed over the patient to the ER staff. They kept trying to resuscitate him, but there's a certain point where there's just nothing that can be done. 

He died. Not surrounded by his family, his friends, his loved ones. Rather, he died surrounded by strangers, fearing what may come next.  "

I was told to say 12, as it would be more ""entertaining"" and also because I was the younger one (I was like 7).

He also had very simple rules, which I had no idea why no one followed. They boiled down to not talking or sleeping while he's trying to teach, and everything will be cool. Yet students would sleep and talk despite him making it clear he always ends the lesson with 10 to 30 minutes before the bell rings, and when we did get that free time, no one talked, no one slept, no one went to the bathroom.

"This is sage advice.

I played the white knight role for a chick who claimed she had a bunch of exes that beat her and said she had cancer after we started dating.  Unfortunately her plan to get knocked up and hit me for child support half worked.  I have full custody of our daughter and that psycho has supervised visitation with her parents every other weekend.

She claimed I beat her, and actually managed to get me arrested *after I called the cops to get her removed from my property*.  Then she moved into a battered women's shelter, which immediately kicked her out after we went to court when she tried to get custody of our daughter back.  My lawyer showed their lawyer photos and police reports from multiple incidents where she hit me or tried-and-somewhat-succeeded to stab me.

Now I'm her ex that used to beat her, and every so often I get a text from whatever new dude she's suckering threatening to whoop my ass."

"My son will say he wants to go ride his bike, then just walks it around the neighborhood.  Every time.  He's 13."
"Something you may be missing is just a personal rule a lot of people have, when dating. Its not about a price tag, they want to have multiple dates with you so they can jydge the real you, before walking into a potential rape dungeon (male or female). 

If they said no to sleeping with you, an you freak out, or get offended, then they know theyve made the right choice. They dont want to be in that situation at all, and thats fair for them to do it. If they have a second date and youre still the gentleman they met last time, then theyll feel better about becoming vulnerable. 

Some men have good days where their flirt game is on point, if the second date, they say something racist/sexist because their flirt game is not on point, the woman can decide whether she wants to see you again.

Alternatively, if you stop texting after she says no after the first date, then she knows she made the right choice not to have sex (and risk getting an STD from a one night stand)."

My family used to go camping a lot when I was younger and they always warned me about ticks.

For seven years I believed there was a tick living inside my brain controlling my face.
"Well, not really true. There's no such thing as ""99% sterile"". Sterile means absolutely 0 living bacteria present. There are low amounts of bacteria in everyone's urine, even before it leaves the urethra and is contaminated by the skin. Also, you can have a sweet scent or, hell I can't believe I'm actually saying this, taste to your urine if you aren't diabetic. Typically after your blood glucose hits 180 mg/dl your kidneys try to dump off the excess glucose into your urine. So that can happen to anyone who binges a shitload of candy, not just diabetic. But it would definitely be more likely to happen to a diabetic person. "

"Work on your self-esteem at the same time. If you hate your body, losing the weight won't make you love it. I used to be a BMI of 34, and have maintained a BMI of about 23 for about a year and a half now. There are still a lot of days where I look in the mirror and don't see any change from when I was at my heaviest, even though I dropped about 7 dress sizes. 

I actually hated myself MORE after I'd lost about 25 pounds, because I'd been working for months to lose the weight but I still looked and felt disgusting. It made me want to give up and just eat all of the brownies. I actually spent a lot of time reading things from the fat acceptance/HAES movement, and I still do frequently, even though I'm no longer fat. I know they get a lot of shit on reddit, but I had to work on feeling like I was worth something as a person, even though I was a fat person, in order to have the motivation to continue my weight loss.

My body still doesn't look good, even on days when I can look in the mirror and see it for what it really is. I've got extra skin, but not enough to be medically necessary to remove, so everything jiggles. My boobs are like grandma boobs. But I work very hard to be body positive, and I'm continuing to work on being healthier. Now that I've achieved the weight loss through diet, I'm working on strength training. I'm probably never going to love the way I look, but I can't let that discourage me from taking care of myself."

"One of my first cases at my old firm involved an emergency flight to London to resolve a contract issue.  A group of executives had negotiated a contract with a big insurance company that included a convoluted equation for their compensation that basically boiled down to Total of X/Total of Y.

During the negotiation process, somebody at the company decided that average would be better than total, and made the change to the equation.  But, critically, not to both parts of the equation.  The contract was changed to Total of X/*Average* of Y.

Nobody noticed the problem, the contract was signed, and the next year when it was time to pay they discovered that instead of owing them about 10 million pounds, they owed -- per the contract -- 1 billion."

"Take a good, hard look at the neighborhood. You may get a great deal on a nice house but it might be because the neighborhood isn't that great. I'm not talking about drive-bys and gang activity, I'm talking about the following:

- Some neighbors down the street have crappy-looking houses/yards, decreasing the value of houses on that street
- Neighbors might be loud, annoying, or do things that bother the area
- A small bar a block or two away can actually affect your street without realizing it
- Street parking may be allowed and you'll notice you don't have a two-way road, rather a one-way-hope-to-god-no-one's-coming road all. the. time.

Good advice would be to talk to some of your neighbors on a weekend by mentioning your looking at a house in the area and was wondering about the neighborhood, parking, any problem neighbors, etc. We didn't realize it but our neighborhood was fine for the price, however we have to contend with some multi-family rental properties that make parking on the street a problem after 5pm, a small town bar a couple blocks away that never had any incidents until a year after we moved in (of COURSE that happens).

It's not a huge deal, however if you're not moving into the suburbs and choosing to live either in or near a major city, DEFINITELY research the neighborhood. Crime stats and reports aren't enough - drive around and get a feeling for it. Go out night and see if it has a lot of questionable people wandering around.

I'm putting some space between us right now... crazy lady..."

"System was always slightly rigged in favor of the house the entire time. That was the design of the government after all. Though the last few decades, it's not even a game anymore. The house just full blown cheats with no consequence. They realized why a second, if I'm the ones in control of the game who can penalize me if I cheat...nobody. Laws are drafted and voted on, they're bought and paid for. Politicians aren't elected, they're bought and paid for. Sanders got as far as it's humanly possible for a grassroots to get. In the end the system still won, because it's not a fair game. "

"Ugh, negging ads are the worst. Wish it wasn't effective. I still remember a guest speaker from one of my marketing classes saying that a good sales technique is to say ""you'll miss x, y, and z if you don't buy this product"" rather than saying ""this product will give you x, y, and z."" That way you play on people's insecurities and fears of being deprived.

"The problem (especially in my generation taught all about self-esteem) is that many people feel like they can do anything they dream about.  But somehow along with that message, they never got across the part about ""you can do whatever you want...**if you work hard to achieve it.""**  

You have to take actionable steps.  You have to set a series of small goals along the way.  Just saying that at some far distant nebulous time in the future you will be big without planning the steps to work toward that goal is delusional.  People are very bad about taking small steps toward a larger goal.  I see this all the time with musicians.  They don't want to work toward being a better musician... they just want to be good... now.  They think that a momentary spurt of excitement and motivation is going to carry them to the top rather than realizing it will actually take years of work and discipline.

Also, to ""make it big"" is a lot of gambling.  It's very luck (and image) based rather than purely skill based.  But you could at least make it as a living with some work even if you don't ever have your name up in lights. 

Musicians tend to fuck up by only aiming for the biggest goal and never cultivating skills to actually become successful out of playing the fame lotto.  Most lose big."

"I spent 2 years on a full scholarship at an international private school overseas. A few other classmates were on scholarship like me, but most of the people there were extremely, *extremely* rich (we're talking royalty and diamond mine owners and shit). I came from a middle-class small-town Canadian family, and while I had a very comfortable life growing up, I couldn't even dream of wealth like these kids had. For example, one of my classmates was known as ""kind of poor"" because his father ""only"" made the equivalent of $300K USD a year (in a country where the average wage was like $10K/yr)...

Usually, it didn't create tension, but there were odd times the wealth disparity would come up. The one that stands out the most was when we were talking about the universities we were going to attend. A group of a dozen of us were sitting at the dinner table, talking about things like tuition and student housing. 

At some point, it came up that I was also looking for a summer job while managing the university paperwork. Everyone turned to *stare* at me, as if I had just said something horrifying. One person said, ""Shouldn't you be relaxing and enjoying your last summer before uni?""

I explained I needed to save up money for the university year, because I was taking the max course load, so I would only be able to work part-time during school.

More stares. ""Why do you need to work at all? Aren't your parents paying for you?""

I said my parents were generously paying my room &amp; meal plan, and I was expected to manage tuition/books/daily expenses between my own savings and scholarships.

My friends were scandalized, and started reacting like I told them my parents beat me or something. ""How could they not pay for their own child?"" and ""Do they not value your education?"" and ""Didn't they plan ahead for this?""

I explained that yes, they valued education, but most of my friends back in Canada were paying their own way through school 100%, and it was even common to take a year or two off just to save up money for it. It's just how things were done in Canada at the time. My parents were going above and beyond the norm, and I was very grateful for it.

The unanimous response: ""We didn't realize Canadians were so poor.""

I still get a bit angry when I think about that conversation. They just couldn't recognize how lucky they were.

(Note: I know times have changed since then - tuition is a lot more expensive in Canada now, and it's more common now for parents to have education funds/trusts for their kids. At the time, though, that kind of thing just wasn't very common. Mom &amp; Dad, if you ever read this, I still consider myself very lucky that you assisted me so much. &lt;3)

"So sorry about this. My grandfather suffers from dementia, and when he lived with my grandmother, they would not allow anyone in to help. He fell and couldn't get up, so my mom called an ambulance. They were livid with her. The hospital refused to release him to her care, so he ended up living in a care home on the other side of town (she doesn't drive). She had multiple heart attacks last Christmas and refused to move out of her home. She was also awful to the care nurses and would refuse to open the door or go out when she had mobile blood lab appointments. She recently died of a heart attack on her way home from Bingo: she hadn't brought her walker or her meds and was intent on going a night where no one could give her a ride. We're in Canada, too, and she'd talk a good game, lie her face off, and avoid anything she didn't like to stay in her house, even though her husband lived elsewhere. I guess I'm just saying I'm sorry, it sucks, but there's only so much you can do for an adult when they don't want help (or for their partner to get help)."
"My roommate genuinely believes that there is a race of lizard people living at the center of the earth. Her lizard people idea comes from a misunderstanding of the term ""lizard brain"" from psychology (of which she has a bachelors in), which she interpreted as the brain actually being part lizard (and in fact she's convinced the human brain is more lizard than human, whatever that means). Not sure where the whole living at the center of the earth thing comes from, but she's a ""being of light"" so I try not to question her wisdom. "

"I work retail and I can tell you that there are hundreds of people who are out of touch with reality and how things work. A list of regular occurances:
1) Person comes in to pay their phone bill. I inform them that due to security reasons we ONLY take credit and visa debit payments for bills (taking that much cash would make us a high target for robbery) and that cash or regular debit can be paid at the bank (which is right besuse us)Their response(s)
""Do you take cash?"" (Literally just said ONLY credit and visa debit)
""Well I tried to pay you! Guess you aren't getting paid now! Haha!"" (You can't just not pay a bill. It's attached to your credit. You're hurting yourself)
2) Due to accounts being attached to your credit we are required by law to check government issued photo ID before we access or disclose any account information. Upon asking for photo ID I get:
""Will my Costco card work?"" ""Will my Health Card Work (doesn't have a photo on it)"" ""This is Bullshit! (They then proceed to pull out their proper photo ID and hand it to me as if it was a difficult or unreasonable request)
""This is stupid. If someone wants to come in and pay my bill you let them!"" (Would you also like me to give them your home phone, address, call hsitory and names of your children/spouse and your account number that they can use to purchase multiple lines attached to your credit?)

But those happen literally every day. One of my favorites was the lady who came up and asked if we had a specific phone in stock. I told her we were currently sold out and she said ""Oh no! I can't do this!!"" And proceeded to cry loudly with her head on the counter. I said ""yeah... we uhhh... we dont have any in right now... but if you go to Walmart accross the street they might have some to sell"" She lifts her head, drys her eyes and says ""Really!? That's great! I really want that phone!"" I say ""yup! They sell those too and usually have a lot in stock"" she says great and then just stands there looking at me. For like a minute. So i say ""yeah.. so if you want one. Probably check out walmart. Cause we dont have any here"" then she slams her head back on the counter and says ""ohh god! This is terrible!! Booo hooo hooo hooo!"" (Thats not me making a crying sound through type. That is actually how she cried. She said the words ""boo hoo hoo hoo""). I then stare blankly ahead. I say ""yup....still dont have any"" and look over to the line up of customers with a face that says ""are you seeing this shit i have to deal with?"" They see my look and just start laughing their asses off. This woman was insane. I wait. Finally she pops up with a big smile. Wipes away her tears and says enthusiastically  ""well! I guess I'm going to Walmart! Thanks for your help!""
""....... Next......""

"About a year ago during the Summer, I worked with my friend's father's junk hauling business. On the very first day, we went to this client's home that was basically inhabitable: both of the women were compulsive hoarders. There was literally rotting food that was years old in the middle of the driveway and stacks of crap so high that you couldn't see out of their windows inside of the house. 

It doesn't end there. For those that have worked in junk hauling, you will know that some clients only want certain crap removed from their property and other things to stay. Well these two women literally told us which *weeds* and *piles of dog shit* to leave alone. Both of them thought that the weeds were sunflowers and the piles of shit were live rabbits. 

At least I got the worst of the worst out of the way on my first day for that summer."

"I know exactly how you feel. My brother and I seemed to be two halves of a superstar creative talent. He got involved with a girl in high school, and one thing led to another and our lives split and we've veered apart and come back together occasionally for brief moments (a few months at a time) over the past 20 years, but most recently (few years ago), he refused to move with me to another state, and I found out recently he was a junky for a long while and now homeless living in a tent. I can only contact him through a guy who happened to buy him lunch one day and found me through linked-in after my brother mentioned me.

"I don't really see it as dumb to cry, but I do tend to get emotional about the things I care about. 

Right off hand, the most recent time I cried was when I killed Mythic Archimonde in World of Warcraft. It wasn't like full on sobbing but I did tear up after we got him. I put a ton of work into getting that kill both in and out of raid. 8 Hours of attempts per week for 4 weeks, and probably 2-3 times that spending time on forums and going over logs trying to fix small mistakes and optimize our strategy. After we got him, the raid leader singled me out and basically said the boss would have been impossible without the work I put in, and then everyone else started thanking me and/or calling me a beast. I just didn't know how to react to that because it was so unexpected, I mean, that victory belonged to all 20 of us, not just me, and here everyone was acting like I did it all by myself. So I got emotional and cried a bit, because I knew my teammates meant every word they said.

Before that, I cried when I watched this scene from Sword Art Online season 2 episode 24. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U41zsKsAgOs

That character's death just really got to me for a variety of reasons. Once again, it wasn't full on sobbing, but the way that show is, her death felt so real to me. Even though she was only around for 7 episodes, it was such a human thing, a little girl with AIDS and cancer. I'd actually kind of felt like I lost a friend, but at the same time the story was inspiring to me, because goddamn she takes it like a champ. No fear of death whatsoever.

So yeah, I cry from time to time. I can't remember any other times I've cried within the last few years though."

"I love this game. 

I understand why people don't like it. You're told it's basically a story about getting a girl across the country and then there're ""zombies."" The direct narrative gets slow and the gameplay slows down lot. 

But it's a story about people. It focuses on Joel and Ellie; how they survive, their relationship and how it evolves. And within their story are a number of other, smaller stories that paint a broader picture of the human condition after the outbreak. 

There's, of course, Sarah. And then there's Tess, Tommy, Bill, Sam and Henry, Marlene, David and his people, and then Ellie's DLC gives her some more background with development of Riley. 

Not to mention all the notes within the places that you pass through, like the Pittsburgh QZ and the sewers near it. 

A lot of people went into that game expecting a story about zombies and instead got a story about people. It isn't an exciting one in the sense of action, but it really is a deep and interesting one. 

Part of the issue arises in that it isn't a blatantly obvious story spoon-fed via cutscenes like in Uncharted, where there might be minor plot development between the action, maybe, but the meat of it is in cutscenes. "

Her mom had a surgery and she went home to visit.  /u/Milkywhitemk6 paid cash for his house, spent upwards of $10,000 redoing all of the hardwood floors, paid for all of the appliances, set the entire place up with smart thermostats and networked LED lighting in every room, hooked the living room up with a 1080p projector and a 160"" screen so she can lounge out there and binge on netflix when she's home, and she's given him a couple hundred bucks as help.  

He had to physically ask her to help out, and when he was painting the place, her brother came down, left him painting by himself on one of the weekends he was working on getting the house ready, and she took that as the opportune time to start her gym membership back up and go out all day with her brother at the gym and for dinner.  The two of them went out for sushi, didn't wait for milky to get done at the house, and they ate without him before he got to the restaurant.  

IMO, he shouldn't even have to ask for help with a partner of 7 years.  She should want to make an even contribution, which realistically is kicking in something towards the appliances and work to make the place livable, and then splitting the taxes and utilities (remember, there's no mortgage because the house was bought cash)."

"I made mustard gas... 

...In a school.

Okay, so I'm a school lab technician and I had to dissolve something in concentrated sulphuric acid for a lesson later that day (it was a long while ago so I don't remember what it was).

Because the school wasn't able to have a prep room for this kind of work I was working in the back of a classroom (because that's where our fume cupboard was) whilst there was a lesson going on. Now I was fairly new to this kind of work and wasn't prepared when, upon adding my solid to the acid, thick yellow smoke started billowing out of the beaker. I'd accidentally used Hydrochloric acid instead of the sulphuric which in turn made pure noxious Chlorine gas. 

Thankfully the fume cupboard contained it all and the head of the department found it more funny than anything else but it scared the shit out of me to have this happen in a room full of 14 year olds. 

tl;dr: Accidentally made a lot of Chlorine gas in a room full of children. Was contained by fume cupboard so no one was poisoned. "
"I thought the point was that it's not worth creating a personal conflict with someone potentially dangerous (like, this guy might shoot my kids, dangerous).

To me, Dorian represented the ideal man.  When he was young and innocent, he was the pure depiction of the beauty and innocence spoken of in Greek antiquity.  As he developed, he became more worldly and more social, the pinnacle of a young Victorian man.  As far as why he becomes so corrupt, it's a bit open-ended to me.  Maybe is was the lack of consequences of his actions, or the way society embraced his moral ambiguity, or just human nature.  Regardless, people, both as individuals and societies, start out so pure and go badly so quickly, and it's very difficult to fix that, or even know how it went wrong.  That was my takeaway."

"How do you think the unthinkable?

With an itheberg. "
"I used to rent a house that shared a driveway with another house. The landlord owned both houses. He promised me my own driveway all five years I lived there, but it never happened. Anyway, when I first moved in, the people in the other house were not terrible; it was a childless married couple with two dogs. I had a bit of an issue with them, where the guy implicitly threatened me with his dogs by saying ""don't get too close, they bite"". But they were quiet and considerate of the shared driveway space. 

Then, the white trash moved in. I don't even know where to begin with this bunch. 

* The lease clearly places a limit on three adults living in the home at any given time. They sure as fuck didn't follow that rule. They had someone different moving in and out every week or so. And they were all variants of the same basic person: The women were all prematurely aged, wore loud/poorly fitting clothing, had cheaply done hair dye jobs, smoked, had tramp stamp tattoos written in illegible fonts and had bitchy voices that could penetrate concrete. The guys spoke with faux southern accents, wore graphic t-shirts with either graffiti art or MMA themes (Tapout, etc) and flat brimmed hats, all had scraggly/thin facial hair and nicknames like ""Scooter"" or ""Shorty"". 

* They were the most inconsiderate fucks with the shared driveway. I would say a good 10% of the time, I would return home and find a huge pickup truck blocking the end of the driveway with no one in it, preventing me from entering. And we lived on a major highway, so it's not like I could just park on the street and ask them to move the truck; I had to park about a quarter mile away and walk back to the house to tell them to move it. When you have a baby as I did, that sort of thing happening more than zero times is downright unacceptable. Not only that, they always took our parking spots. I would have to literally shuffle my cars to park one of them in the ""contested"" spot if I left the house, otherwise it would be taken when I got back. Keep in mind, they already had five spots on their side, and we had three spots on our side. When the landlord tried to talk to them about this, one of the guys said ""We have more cars, dawg. They only have two."" The landlord reminded them that the parking spots are clearly designated in the lease and that it seemed like they had a lot of ""visitors"".

* They would have loud domestic arguments at 2 AM. We would have our windows open in the summer, and would hear such wonderful screamed dialog as ""My sister used to be beautiful and because of you now she takes her clothes off for money!"", ""Help me open this door, I'm drunk!"" and ""You don't even lick my asshole anymore, goddamnit!""

* They would never stop playing shitty music. In one particular egregious occasion, they were dancing to Sir Mix A Lot on their front lawn at 3 AM. 

* They had picnic tables and adriondack chairs as their furniture (you could see right in their windows, they never put up curtains or blinds, except in one room where they hung sheets on the windows)

* One of them backed their truck into my grill and sandwiched it between the trunk bumper and the house, causing structural damage to the rear porch. They tried to blame me. I called the police, they measured the bumper height of the truck vs. both of my cars. The police report agreed with my side of the story, thankfully. I'm also very lucky that the propane tank didn't rupture. 

Thankfully, they FINALLY got evicted when the landlord couldn't keep ignoring the fact that there were approximately 7 adults living in the place at any given time. He busted them more than once, but of course they were all on some sort of disability or government assistance, so the sob story worked a few times. "
"Assuming this isn't a pedophilia joke, I'd say that's not necessarily the case.

"The main living area and bedrooms were pretty normal. It's just that everything got shoved up in the attic when it wasn't used, and then forgotten about. 

Since this was a farmhouse out in the country, when we went to clean the attic we ended up disturbing dozens of mice. I'm a city boy and had never seen a live mouse before then. I think I handled it pretty well... I only shrieked in utter terror the first five or six times. "

But a little back story, we were at her friends house and were doing the deed in a vacant bedroom (as in the person who lived there was ""out of town"" according to the host). So we finish up, and right as I'm about to crash I hear the front door of the house open. Huh, who is that I wonder? Hmm, the footsteps are coming... right for the door. Huh, that sounds a lot like someone putting a key into the door knob. Ohhh holy fuck the person who lives in this room is coming home. We both hid under the covers just like, oh god what do we do???! The door opens, the light turns on, utter silence for a brief moment, both parties wondering what the fuck to make of this situation I imagine. I basically pull the covers down and immediately say ""I am soooo sorry, the host gave us permission we'll get right the fuck out of here, we were just 'sleeping', sorry sorry sorry."" This was at 5 am mind you, could you imagine getting home at 5 am and you just wanna crash in your bed but instead two drunk strangers are in it??? She (the girl who actually lived in the room) was surprisingly not super pissed off, we got out of there, slept on the floor of the living room for an hour and then went home. I later heard that I had ""Came all over her bed"". Needless to say I never went to that house again. Saw the girl I was sleeping with a few more times but ultimately she turned out to be a handful.

"In the Christian tradition, I have found Process Theology to be really intriguing. It is still very much a developing school of thought but the gist (as I understand it, which may be very little) is that God responds to the world. God is not the ""planner"" of more conservative theology, God is a ""relator."" God and humans co-create the world together, and this creative relationship is first and foremost about love, not power. God does not ""ordain the future,"" God sort of establishes the framework in which we can act, and by acting we shape the future and we effect God. This is a God who responds joyfully to the acts of love that we do and who grieves the unloving choices we make. That's my super dumbed down understanding of it. Basically, God is not powerful in the traditional sense, but God is truly loving. Which I like.

Process Theology is not associated with any particular denomination that I am aware of, but if you have a Unitarian church in your area that might not be a bad place to start either. They, traditionally, don't accept doctrines like ""original sin"" or ""predestination.""

Outside of the Christian tradition if you have a fairly liberal Jewish community around that might be good. Look for a Reformed Synagogue I think (any Jewish people want to confirm or correct my recommendation please?)

I know less about Islam but I think Sufism, a kind of mysitical Islam, especially western sufism might be closer to that direction if you are interested.

Beyond those three religions there are a whole world of spiritual and mystical beliefs that I know too little about to comment on, but could be helpful."
But Africa is bigger than the U.S. And Europe put together and more populous. Also the U.S. is one country. This is a false equivalence on many counts

"Well that's the thing, I don't live downtown where the majority of the college students live, I live in the suburban area, my apartment complex is a higher cost and the whole area is geared toward new families.  These guys I don't think were having a party, there was no music, no loud people, just the weird noise.  Either way, even if I did live downtown with the college students, there are still noise ordinances, so even if they laughed me away, I'm guessing they would have taken the cops a little more seriously.  My downstairs neighbors actually did have a party problem on Friday nights.  The first time was New Year's, so I let it go, figuring it was just the holiday.  The second time, I called the apartment manager.  The third time, I didn't go down there myself (I am, oddly enough, generally not a very confrontational person in the real world, and some of the people downstairs were not people I wanted to upset, they were very large, loud, drunk men, and not college students),  I just called the police after they woke me up around 1 AM, I waited 2 hours for their party to calm down before finally making the call so I could get some sleep.  I really gave them a chance to calm the party down, and it wasn't happening.  They also are pretty sure I'm the one who made the call.  I know this because the woman who lived there answered the door for the cop, and I heard her yell at him, ""I bet it was that bitch upstairs who made me take down my windchimes.""  I don't need them to be my friends, I just need them to not disturb my already hard to keep sleep scheduled.  *They don't party anymore in their apartment, judging by a phone call she made the next morning (she took it out on her patio, so I could hear everything), once she was sobered up, she was a bit less brave and took it a lot more seriously.  

Also: The billiards noise had been going on all day on and off for several days.  Still don't know what they were doing, but it was a horrible, painful sound.  "

At least in my experience (I'm a girl), the guys with who I find out later are moderately-to-well endowed, are usually the ones that're a lot more relaxed, and therefore a lot more charismatic if we're on a date or something. It's probably just the psychology of thinking they don't have anything to worry about in that aspect, so it's one less anxiety they carry around.

I work in digital security and was in the area for a large event, so he starts talking about the industry; things related to government surveillance and the like.  It's apparent that he's an intelligent guy who understands the nuances of tech and legal issues related to tech, which makes for a rare but great conversation.  Eventually, he begins to tell us about how there is a lot of research going on at Stanford to use the color spectrum for encryption.  I'd not heard about this work before, so it was initially interesting.  He kept trying to explain (without really saying anything meaningful) how this was going to change the world and revolutionize privacy for us ""regular people"" and prevent the government from ""snooping around in our business.""  He then proceeded to tell us that tires were going to the the reason humanity doesn't survive beyond 2020. 

Yeah, you read that right.  Tires.  It seems that tires and other vulcanized rubber products used in high friction applications create rubber dust that's polluting everything.  All that black staining you see on cars in the city?  It's not soot/dirt/dust/etc. that's dirtying those cars, it's rubber particulate.  It's destroying our oceans, causing cancer, creating holes in the ozone layer.  Luckily for us, this guy and some of his friends have a startup that's gonna save us from ourselves, but he's really worried he won't get the message out in time.  He unleashed his vision of a rubber-free world upon us for the remaining 20 or so minutes of our ride, each progressively weirder and less comfortable than the last.

Like, Venkman would've been called to help in the final battle, and he would be seen on a beach with his grandkids. He would check his phone, decline the call, and go back to sipping his drink.

"Not true at all. If anything, the US having such a huge military budget encourages other countries to increase their spending as well. That's how arms races happen.

Countries like the UK, Canada, etc each spend between 1-2% of their GDP on defence spending. 1-2% of a rich country's GDP is a HUGE amount of money to spend just on the military.

The US spends 3.5% of a much bigger GDP--an almost unfathomable sum of money---on defence spending. And the truth is... no one really knows why. It's not used for ""defending other countries"" nor do these other countries factor in US defence spending when calculating their own budgets.

It might be a nice fantasy to believe that Americans don't get, for example, free health care because they're spending all their money helping out other countries (as if!), but there is no basis for this belief.

Americans have a huge military because that's what Americans want. There is no other reason. The same goes for why Americans don't have free healthcare... because Americans don't want it. 

Likewise, other countries have what they have because they choose to spend money on it. The US military budget doesn't factor into the decision. "

"&gt; What makes you think the UK is expecting benefits of membership without membership?

Not UK leaders, but people that we read here in the comments, saying that the EU is trying to punish the UK, and that the UK should keep their current advantages (rebate in their membership fees, european banking passport), even after leaving the EU and negotiating a new trade deal.

The British should not expect this. It's not a punishment, but banking has to be done within the EU so that it can be regulated by the EU. How anyone can argue against that is beyond me."

The married couple left the car and no one said a word. Dropped the female off at her place and she left the car silent and then dropped off the male at his place.

"Non sexual: Had diarrhea so badly while waiting to use a public restroom. When the previous guy came out, I rushed in.

The guy stopped up and broke the toilet so badly that shitty water was flowing into the bathroom. This was the only toilet and only bathroom.

I knew I wasn't going to make it to another restroom without shitting my pants. 

The trash can was waist high. I bent over and tried to shit in the trash can while standing up. 

I underestimated the force built up inside me. 

I completely splattered the wall of the bathroom.

There were no paper towels, and cheap gas station toilet paper wasn't going to be up to the task. So I cleaned *myself* up as best as I could, and slunk out of the area.

I still feel so bad for the clerk who I am sure came in after me....."

The party was set up to make it seem like her mom was trying to arrange a marriage for her.  They flew in boys who the producers had hired to pose as suitors for her.  She made a big stink when the majority of students at the school refused to attend.

The show has already aired in Britain, and she's gotten completely called out on social media for how fake it was.

"Dialects that pronounce /r/ at the end of a syllable as a consonant.  AKA rhotic accents.  They make up the majority of North America, Scotland, Ireland, and and the West Country.  

You speak in a non-rhotic accent, meaning that you don't pronounce /r/ as a consonant unless it precedes a vowel, like in ""rake"", ""break"", or ""flooring"" (compare to ""start"" or ""floor"").  For you, a written ""r"" after a vowel is actually a vowel modifier rather than a consonant.

Other pairs that rhotic speakers distinguish that you might not include ""caught"" vs ""court"", ""coda"" vs ""coder"", ""spa"" vs ""spar"", and ""Korea"" vs ""career"".

All of that said, other dialects lack distinctions that you make.  I'm a western American, so ""caught"" and ""cot"" are identical for me, as are ""ma"" and ""maw"" and ""sari"" and ""sorry"".  Where you have three distinct vowel sounds distinguishing those words and dozens of others (short O, broad A, and aw), I only have one."

I rather think that believing the most aggressive and hostile people of any group to be an undisputed representation of that entire group is...flawed. 

Because you know what? There *would be* a dispute among Muslims that you should be put to death. Wanna know why? Because most Muslims don't walk around thinking people should be put to death, nor do the majority of them harbor any sort of desire to put anyone to the death. 

This is probably going to sound really mean but oh well... Don't think so highly of yourself as to assume that ""there's no dispute among Muslims"" about your existence. Trust me, you truly are not that important to the majority of 1.7 billion Muslims just trying to live their lives. "

The night before he passed, I was working, and he didn't look good at all. He had copd pretty bad and had fluid in his lungs and just looked awful. I kept trying to get him to go to the hospital, because they'd be better equipped to deal with any emergent situations, but he kept refusing saying all they'd do is leave him with a big bill. I pleaded one last time with him, and when he refused, I told him that if he died, I was gonna track him down and kick his ass. He was this seriously badass marine who probably could've beaten the daylights out of me no matter what shape he was in, so he chuckled and his last words to me were ""Don't worry, I ain't gonna die any time soon.""

Most of the wedding consisted of it, aside from a few classic rock songs.  The DJ was this older white guy, looked about 50-60.  At the end, he said ""We've got no more requests before I go, so if the bride doesn't mind I'm going to choose a song.  It's my favorite one to play at the end of a gig.""  Seeing the way the guy looked and acted, I was expecting something like a Beach Boys song or some older country song.  Instead, the guy goes with ""Down With The Sickness"" (even went with the uncensored version, not the radio edit) and the wedding turns into a straight up mosh pit for the last few minutes.  Definitely the best ending to a wedding I've ever been to."

The Tokyo fire bombings have estimates of 75,000 to 200,000 killed and caused nearly 1,000,000 people to lose their homes."

"Yeah, well, that actually does sound a lot like depression (I've seen it up close, though never experienced). Even though I identify with a lot of what you said.

See, I'm also disappointed in the totality of humanity, on a very visceral level. All that wasted potential in general, and even in specific cases most people end up being a disappointment in many ways.

Yet, it doesn't really affect me in the way of taking my general enjoyment of life away. Sure, it's a bother as there's a lot of humanity to deal with, but it doesn't desensitize me in the way you describe. I have no desire to escape to drugs or travelling (not to say they'd be bad choices in ever case), I'm quite fine just taking the parts I enjoy. Playing music, playing games, watching tv, reading books, writing stories, etc. Basically enjoying life, while knowing it's thoroughly fucked up.

Sure, you could paint me as someone who doesn't realise just *how* fucked up things are, and who knows, maybe you're right. But it doesn't seem like that from my perspective.

Just remember, depression isn't (just) a state of mind, it's a state of brain, possibly triggered by a state of mind (amongst other things). It'll be a lot more fun to not be depressed. And it doesn't mean you can't still continue to loathe humanity as a failure.

But then again, finding proper therapy to help or identify the potential depression would be a hassle in your case, since the overwhelming vastness of the world's fucked-upness is something that the therapist probably just wouldn't understand. And that would be a problem."

And the other commenter is right, early alcohol consumption (not even getting happy) stops the full development of the brain, the brain doesn't fully develop until 25. And the safe amount of alcohol for an ADULT to drink is 2 glasses of wine/beers for males and 1 for females. "

Mordin was a salarian geneticist and ex special ops task force member  who was brilliant but a bit arrogant.  He tries to base his decisions on logic as opposed to personal or emotional beliefs, which can make him seem a bit cold blooded.   

He supported the Genophage which had all but wiped out the krogan racv, going so far as to champion and then develop a modified strain which was even deadlier than the first.

Eventually a cure for the genophage is made, and falls into Mordin's hands.   Despite his previous stance on the subject, he makes a conscious choice to release it and save the krogan race... at the expense of his own life.   As he steps onto the elevator to spread the cure he  he delivers the line in question.   It is a wry acknowledgement of his own personal shortcomings, and a callback to an earlier conversation in the game where he says basically the same thing in a much more arrogant fashion.

In the tape you could see the entrance of the elevators. Patients always complain about the children playing in their rooms but the staff never thought much about it because those patients were on pretty hard meds (this was the ICU).

In this one tape you could see a doctor coming out of the elevator and behind him a little girl in a dress, then they just get out of that cameras' reach and the little girl doesn't appear anymore. When they asked the doctor about it he didn't remember any girl but the pacients still say they can see children playing in their rooms.

"If a base runner were to run when the ball is in the air and then caught by the defending team, then the base runner would have to go back to their base. So if there is a fly ball, the players on a base will stay on their base and let the defending team catch the ball so they can run to the next base. This is called tagging up. If the fly ball is in the infield and the rule stated by OP does not exist and the infielder decides to drop the ball, the batter and the base runners would be forced to run the the next base making it easy to get a double play. Sorry if this doesn't make sense. It's kind of hard to explain because of the multiple rules that come into play.

"Made a burner account for this, no way I'm sharing this one with my regular handle at this point.  Been ten years and I've got a wife now and everything.

My last year of college, I splurged for a nice little private suite in one of the newer dorm buildings.  I knew I'd have both a thesis and a major project, so the privacy and access to campus was worth it.  It  was in a separate ""wing"" of the building, so I could see all of the outward windows on the other side of the building. 

Once I figured out that I could see inside everyone's windows at night if they had the light on and didn't have a curtain, I acted like Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window and just kind of looked around at what everybody was doing.  The design of the building was kind of stupid, they just had big glass windows on both the bedrooms and bathrooms, and they didn't come with curtains or blinds.  Apparently you were supposed to supply your own, and a lot of people made something makeshift like putting a flag over it or something. I was able to see some interesting stuff for a while from the people who left their windows uncovered, but nothing out of the ordinary for a college dorm and I kind of lost interest.

One night later in the semester I'd just gotten back from the gym and was going to take a shower.  I kind of lazily peeked out the window before I did and I noticed another girl also in her bathroom, and she hadn't bothered to put anything over the window.  She was totally naked, and was extremely attractive.  I kind of hid behind my curtain and looked for a second or two, and I freaked out to see that she'd noticed me looking.  Even more so when I realized I had subconsciously started holding myself.

Shit, I thought.  She was going to file a complaint or something and I'd forever be labelled a perv or whatever.  Instead, she just stares right at me and kind of smiles.  I realize we're both naked in our respective bathrooms and we both apparently were enjoying each other's view.  She even started touching herself as well before she got in the shower.

After that I passed her a few times on campus and we never said a word to each other but always kind of shared a knowing smile."
"Having him (me!) give up his appartment to move in together then expressing doubts just before the move and demanding a week to figure things out, then breaking up, then asking him to come back, spend the night together, then having him drop you to a restaurant where you meet your friends, then kissing the guy you've told so much good about to your now ex and who you said you'd never date, then telling said ex, then date said friend.

I am a fucking idiot for still not being able to hate her. She broke things in me that will never mend. Basically all that was good, naïve and idealistic about relationships. From now on it's going to be nothing but covering my ass and getting what I want out of it unless I find a truly honest and kind girl that's also good looking (do they still make those?)

I have no fault in said breakup since I repeatedly checked with her if I could improve anything in our relationship and there was nothing according to her. Of course, I had changed for the worse but nothing was working out professionally or financially and I knew and told her how I felt and that it would get better. I think she wasn't ready for the next step and wanted to «live her life».

Still a fucking hurtful way of parting."

"Ugh, kind of a long story, but I will try to keep it short.
I lived in a town that was a hub for transients and hippies. That's all fine and dandy, but this guy was an interesting character. 
His name was ""One Eye"" and he was the partner of this little hippie gal I met. He was blind in one eye and it was completely silver, not important to the story, but it definitely paints a picture.
One Eye showed up to my buddy's party, and was ecstatic to tell everyone that he and his partner were trying to make a baby. We all feigned enthusiasm, as he was homeless and was VERY high on acid almost constantly. He was telling my pal and I that he was drinking an ancient fertility drink to make him more able to conceive. He was a very spiritual guy, so when he offered a sip to my buddy, he didn't want to be rude. He took the cup of mystery juice that One Eye had poured from a little satchel around his neck. Right as my buddy was smelling this mystery concoction, One Eye said the main ingredients were ""herbs, earth, and my seed"".
Yes. One Eye had just offered my pal a cup of his baby batter. He politely declined.
Later in the evening, One Eye started acting odd (more odd than usual). He started talking in loops, and pacing in a circle. I figured the acid was hitting him a little hard so I did my best to comfort him and keep him positive. He wasn't having it. He kept telling me that I was ""a blessed being"" but the woman that I was seeing at the time was ""a succubus"" that ""needed to be dealt with"". He started developing a delusion that he was Jesus, so I promptly left the party. I guess later in the evening he started trashing the house after deciding that my buddy was his arch nemesis, the anti-Christ.
The next day, I was taking a break by a creek behind my work, and I saw One Eye trudging towards me from under the bridge in waist deep water. He had a walking stick behind his neck, hanging his arms over it, in a 'Jesus on the cross' fashion.  When he got out of the creek and approached me, I noticed he had stigmata type wounds on his hands and feet. He came up to me and put his hands on my shoulders and proceeded to tell me that he had damned all of last nights party goers, and I need not worry about them any longer. He handed me a rock that he told me was precious to him, and told me I was blessed. In the midst of his rambling he seemed to have a moment of clarity. He looked at me and said ""I'm not schizophrenic like my mom keeps saying.""
I listened to his ramblings about the second coming for 10 or so minutes, before I had to go back to work. I watched him get back into the creek and go under the bridge. I never saw One Eye again.
Long story short, don't do a bunch of LSD if you show symptoms of serious mental illness.

TL;DR schizophrenic guy on acid offered my friend a cup of his jizz, thought everyone there was a demon, proceeded to crucify himself and leave town never to be heard from again.

She couldn't under stand how she could get a fine again ... she had already paid for this type of offense..... 

She seemed to believe that once you've paid a fine for a certain type of offence she'd have carte blanche to commit it again in  perpetuity. 

To top it all of, this was a young student with no work. And the car was leased for 2 years. 

For the period of those 2 years the car is hers by definition, so the police will hold on to it for that period before returning it to the leasing company. The company in turn, will keep charging her the monthly cost for the car..

The guy went back to the doctor just livid. ""If you don't do it right this time, I'm gonna sue!"" etc. etc. So the doctor removed even more of his vas deferens. Lo and behold, the man's wife came home pregnant a third time. It was around this point, his buddies from work sat him down and told him that maybe it wasn't the doctor's fault. Maybe his wife was fucking somebody else. He refused to believe it. He went to a different doctor to get a third vasectomy, but the doctor just told him, there's nothing to cut. The spermatic cord was pretty much just stumps. He told him to go home and get himself a lawyer.

The mercury that goes into a small number of vaccines is ethyl mercury which is completely harmless and is eliminated by the body within about a week of entering into it.  It is not stored in the tissue nor is it a neurotoxin.  Aluminum is even less of an issue because it exists naturally, in much larger quantities than is found in vaccines, inside of food we eat.  It's also an immune system *stimulant*, meaning that in moderate doses it actually boosts your body's ability to fight off viruses and bacteria.  

Even the formaldehyde used in vaccines is used to kill the viruses and the body will also naturally eliminate it no problem, with absolutely no side effects.  Know what else has formaldehyde in it that you probably eat without worrying about it?  A large number of fruits and vegetables.  "

"Is measuring suffering always subjective? If I poke you in the ribs, you may suffer, but it's surely better than stabbing you. Likewise, if I have the option to kill numerous animals or deprive one of momentary happiness, is the latter not preferable? 

Because something is not always clear or perfectly quantifiable doesn't make it completely arbitrary or subjective. You are free to disagree on what option in any situation causes the least suffering, but it doesn't make choosing between the options available simply subjective judgments."

"My first trip to a casino was in Connecticut. I expected the same thing as you but instead got rows of old people with oxygen tubes up all their noses. The casino also had a rewards program, so the more you gambled, the more rewards you could win. This mean that all of them had this little plastic card you stuck in the machine while you played, and to prevent losing it, you kept it on one of those spiraly springing cords. They all looked like they were plugged into their life support machines, pissing away their life savings in order to try to win more time on Earth."
"I go to casino a few times a year.  I honestly see this as fun and entertainment.  I would never go into a casino thinking I am going to win big.

"Who controls that narrative, and who benefits from it? Do the youth control the media outlets that perpetuate that narrative, or do wealthy boomers? Do the youth benefit from alienating themselves, or do the wealthy use that trope as a way to make themselves and others in their generation feel better about keeping their boot on the throat of the younger generations? Follow the money. Always follow the money. Who is benefiting from the student loan crisis? The boomers who own the debt. Who is benefiting from the housing crisis? The boomers who own the property. Who benefited from the banking crisis? Who benefited from the wars? All of the companies that benefit from the misfortune of Americans are owned/controlled by the boomer generation right now, and they're not doing anything to stop it. But when I say that, I'm badmouthing a generation who did nothing but love me and nurture me. When I point out the realities of who benefits, and who doesn't, I'm a whiny little brat. My parents are that generation, . I don't hate boomers, but I don't see them through rose colored glasses either. They're getting filthy fucking rich by exploiting their kids and their grandkids generations. They're getting rich by exploiting us. So, being badmouthed on the internet seems like a small price for them to pay. I'm not too worried. They can afford it. "

"Negative. When you first recognize something may be off, call 911. The unit that responds will do a stroke assessment and take them. Reason  being, that not all hospitals are capable of handling someone with a stroke. You taking them there on your own may cost them precious brain cells or thier life. Seriously. Call 911.


Edit: just saw your aspirin note too. **OH GOD NO ASPIRIN.** So you're right but mostly wrong.. 

There are 2 types of strokes. One where there is a blockage and blood clot. And one where there is a burst blood vessel and active bleeding. The most common type is the blockage (about 83-85%) and yes, in theory aspirin would help as it makes clots difficult to form. However, if it is a bleed, this could be devastating. This is why the hospital will not give clot busters until a CaT scan is done. It's also why ambulances don't give it either. So no aspirin. Good thinking by averages (you're not the only person I've heard deduce this), but the potential risk far outweighs the potential benefit."

Well you see, there are these fields of study called molecular biology, biochemistry, and organic chemistry.  Legitimate medicine relies on the foundation of these areas of study.

The results are then applied and drugs are implemented under strict scrutiny by the FDA.

Every facet of your life relies on the basic tenants of science: the clothes you wear, the car you drive, the house you live in, your cell phone.

"Walking back from a bar at 3am in Shanghai and realizing my buddies and I are being trailed by a couple of shady looking men.  To paint a better picture, during the day the mains streets are filled with so many people you can hardly move, but past about 1am the streets are damn near empty.  Even the neon lights on most of the buildings shut off around then.  So me and two of the other guys on my trip are drunkenly trying to find our way back to our hotel when we come to the realization that we haven't been alone.  After having them take the same turns as us multiple times (turns that any local would realize are far from the quickest way of going anywhere), we decided the best course od action would be to duck inside the Mcdonalds a few dozen yards ahead.  

Upon entering the Mcdonalds and getting in line to place our orders we are mortified to see the two men also enter the Mcdonalds.  At this point we're all shitting our pants thinking this is how it all ends.  However, when the men enter the restaurant they just stand perpendicular to the line stare us up and down for a few seconds, then leave like nothing happened.

I still have no clue what they were doing or why they followed us, but that experience still stands as one of my scariest moments abroad.  Beijing and Seoul had a few that were up there, but nothing quite so blatant. "

"I was in India for six months for a job. This was my fourth time there and I got pretty good at not getting sick. I was four months in withou an incident. I got lunch from one of my usual places. After lunch I called a small team meeting in my office with four other employees, and about five minutes in My stomach started rumbling and sweat started pouring off me. One of my teammembers commented that I looked paler than usual, and I quickly ended the meeting so I could rush to the bathroom to ""do the needful.""

I was a spoiled westerner who, in over a year of total time all over India, never had to use a squat toilet. At our office there were five stalls, one of which had a western toilet, the rest with squatters and the usual soaking wet floors.  Of course the western toilet was occupied, and there was no waiting going to happen.

I had to take my pants fully off because I was afraid I might poop on them, all the while holding back what felt like all the insides of my body trying to get out. I spread my legs as far as I could, afraid things were going to be so explosive my shoes would be in danger, and sumo squatted as deep as i could over the hole.  I let loose an explosion of hot lava, feeling a few wet particles, rejected by the porcelin sirrounding the hole, splash against the back of my thighs.

The smell was not something I thought could possibly come from a live body. I crouched there dripping, sweat soaked through my shirt, contemplating how I could wash my ass with the water pitcher under the faucet in the corner of the stall. Just a couple of feet away, people were coming and going, speaking Tamil, and most definitely talking about me.

I probably wasted ten gallons of water trying to shower my burning, stinking asshole, and doing a pretty ineffective job. I waddled back to the office dizzy and disoriented and arranged for a cab while trying to keep conversation with worried colleagues short and distant. I got back to my hotel, took a long shower, and found shit stains betraying my poor ass washing skills on my favorite khakis."

"One of my former coworkers was extremely out of touch with reality.

He had a good knowledge of some things he was interested in, but had next to no social skills. He thought he was fantastic at his job and assumed that he kept everything running, when in fact, everyone hated working with him because he made everything slower.

He is conservative, and would loudly and blatantly say his opinions on everything to everyone, even if they were racist, xenophobic, or downright insane. He firmly believes that the best way to stop terrorism and all the problems in the middle-east  is to nuke them, and that ""the mountains would stop the fallout"". He has said time and time again that if he became president of the U.S.A. (thankfully we live in Canada) he would nuke many countries and areas in the world.

He firmly believes that the Liberals are the problem behind basically everything in our country, and has even made wild accusations and statements about things the Liberal party supposedly did. For example: He came into work one day and was talking about how mad he was, because, according to him, the Liberal government had just legalized beastiality in Canada, which is both untrue and absolutely ridiculous.

He would talk about deporting people, and would frequently say things that could only be thought by crazy people, at least in  my opinion anyways.

Thankfully, he quit a few weeks ago, and I probably won't be seeing him again, but he was definitely the most I've seen someone be out of touch with reality."

I woke up in the middle of the night with nausea and diarrhea cramps. I ran to the restroom, where I started puking and shitting simultaneously. I held the trash can while I sat on the toilet, expelling everything in my digestive system. 

I finally felt better, so I rinsed the trash can and took it to my room. I woke up again and ran to the restroom, leaving my trash can behind. I now had nowhere to puke, so I lifted my ass a little off the seat so I could lean over and throw up in the tub.

As soon as I did that, I trusted a fart. I sat back down and felt the seat all gunky on my right butt cheek. Turns out I sharted all over the sink, the wall, the floor, and even BEHIND the toilet. 

It was like 5 am at this point and I was delirious. I don't remember cleaning anything up. It was so bad, I blocked it out of my memory. So yeah, that's my poop story.  "

"- The Autobahn is really good engineered and well maintained, especially on the parts where you can drive unlimited (for comparisson: The Autobahn tarmac is more than twice as thick as on your typical US Interstate)
- The german driving education is pretty good, taking you 14? (I think) theory lessons and another 10-20 practical lessons (which cover driving in cities, in the countrieside, on the Autobahn and at night) before you can take your exam (And costing between 1.5 k and 2.5 k € for a typical student)
- You can't drive a car on your own before you're 18
- There is a law that says you have to drive on the right most lane available, so the faster lanes aren't clogged by guys traveling at 120 to 130 all the time
- If everyone drives fast, you won't run into people driving a lot slower than you that often
- Many parts of the Autobahn either have a constant speed limit or have dynamic limits, so the traffic surveilance can set limits for rush hours or if there are accidents"

I went to leave and he was all like ""Why are you leaving 30 min early"" I explained I had 30 min left and didn't take the lunch, its unpaid so I wouldn't be costing anything but my own time. Well in his mind I would have to stay 30 min after that for taking a lunch even tho I was scheduled not to. In the end I left and made sure I was scheduled for 8.5 hours after, so ridiculous"

"Not OP, but,

Personally, and it's mainly my political views speaking here, I think that it was the right thing for them to leave. Being a libertarian, I feel like the EU has too many governmental powers and I think big government isn't a big thing. People just think it's an economic union but they have a legislative branch, executive branch, a judicial branch, a central bank (well this is kind of needed), and a branch of auditors. The EU can enact laws that overwrite the UK's, which is the opposite of democracy. Not to mention that they can't vote on the EU's council members, only UK leaders have some influence, and that's just leaders. On top of that they take millions of pounds each week to prop up broke countries like Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania, I don't think that it's in the UK's best interest (or anyone's interest) to prop up those failing countries. Hell it's not anyone else's job to prop up failing countries, I get that they're in the EU so they have to help the nations that are broke, but I just don't think (in the state things are in) there should even be an EU.

The US, Germany, and Canada all want to now set up special trade agreements with the UK and that's going to be a huge deal so we'll see how that works out for them. Not to mention they now have 8 countries very interested in a referendum. Italy, France, Sweden Germany, Poland, Spain, Hungary, and Belgium are all now interested in a referendum, and I feel like things aren't as bad as the Western media is portraying it to be. I mean why else would 8 other countries follow suit? I think that the EU, in theory, was a great idea, but I don't believe that lawmakers should have that much power over a wide group of nations. Big government is never a good thing in my opinion, with more laws and regulations, usually comes less freedoms for the people.

Of course the market is going to fall in the short term. But on the bright side, real estate is at an all time low, the special trade deals should get their economy booming soon, and now it's easier for UK natives to find a job in their motherland. I think that the UK is a stable democracy and they will continue just fine without the EU, and now they will continue to build a strong, competitive economy outside the EU. The British pound hasn't depreciated in value or suffered crisis quite like the Euro has. They are also now out of the single market, which means they can buy things from anywhere in the world without being under the agricultural laws of the EU. So they can now buy much cheaper food. Immigration is still a thing and as long as you have your passport, you can travel to the country. They also now have an open opportunity to openly trade with countries from the EU without their heavy-handed laws, and also, manufacturing, the steel industry, and the fishing industry are all untapped job markets that can be broken into once again. 

So to sum all of that up, I think politically, there's no better choice than to keep the EU out of your politics. Economically, short term bad, but long term, I think they'll definitely come out on top. Sorry for the short novel."

"Well, it deals with the associative cortex and the stereotyping part of the brain.

For example...

If two things always occur together then the brain assumes that one must be caused by the other.  And if one shows up, the brain naturally expects the other to present itself shortly.

Like...

A tiger shows up, and it always wants to eat me.  I assume that wanting to eat me is just what tigers do, because that's how my brain associates concepts together.  In pre-civilization times, this worked pretty damn well to keep you alive (or it helped to at least avoid the tiger for as long as you could until it actually did eat you).

What's happening in Steve Harvey's brain is that when he was growing up, it probably was tied together that people's behavior and going to church (being religious) have a cause and effect relationship.

Good behavior and being religious were stereotyped together.  It in no way actually means that they do cause one another, but the brain isn't wired for scientific inquiry, it's wired to keep you alive...

Good behavior and religion just go together (in his brain).

Of course, if you change the environment were someone witnesses good and bad behavior, religious and non-religious belief then the brain will form different associations.  Presumably that religion has no effect on behavior.

He might come off as a douche, but what's happening in Steve Harvey's brain is perfectly natural, though maybe problematic in 21st century humanity.  It is a product of his upbringing and environment.

That being said, yeah, I am completely non-religious and I consider myself to be pretty well behaved."

"We almost never ""make"" money off of wars.  It definitely jump start our economy. 

Whenever any government spends that much money, it is going to trickle down.  It's going to go to large contracts who are then going to contract smaller contractors and support companies.

We'd see a similar effect if we spent 2 trillion on infrastructure improvements.  The big difference would be there would be a big boom in the construction industry not the weapon industry.  We'd get bridges, tunnels, roads and railways out of it.  

We'd probably end up with near the same amount of people on our side dying.  Huge construction projects almost always claim a few lives but we wouldn't have the huge mortality on the other side."

Many changes he tried got voted down by the legislature and when he tried to appeal to the public by putting things to public ballot, the people did not vote for his measures. So in effect he was an impotent leader and most things you had issues with during his time in power is more than likely the fault of the legislature.

His environmental record as governor, specifically greenhouse gas emissions flies in the face of any Republican stance. He accepted no salary during his governorship. His chief of staff was a democrat.

Oh, yes – the employee who was assaulted was out on disability (for both the whiplash and for diagnosed PTSD – I totally believe it) for a while, and did press charges. I don’t know what the outcome was there.

The manager eventually left for unrelated reasons – the juicy gossip is that he had gotten a customer pregnant at a company event several years prior before his retirement, and coming back to our state had put him in the line of fire for child support because she hadn’t been able to find him before. The manager certainly did leave town with no notice (like we literally found a note saying he was gone on a Monday morning), and there were certain other corroborating events. Whatever the reason, the HR manager came back to work when he left.

The Werther effect states that widely publicised suicides lead to a spike in similar suicides, especially if the reports are glamorized or the details are sensationalized in the media. The Papageno effect is the exact opposite, induced through a focus on suicide prevention and those hurt by the suicide.

Total opposite effects on the populace induced by what is basically a scaled-up version of the same social cue awareness."

"I had a very good friend who was on Virgin Nation on MTV 

The show basically revolved around following 18 year olds and seeing what their life is like being a virgin in a culture that is so awash with sex. They go on dates during the show and try to find love, because at the end of the season they have to decide whether or not they want to have sex. 

The problem? My friend had fucked numerous girls before. I had personally hooked him up with women. They interviewed me before the show aired, but of course I claimed he was a virgin. I guess all of his other friends did too. 

Also, half the time they told him what to say during the ""personal"" interviews. Essentially giving him emotions that fit the scene. "

So it got my curiosity on Issei Christian's and a church that has quite a few Issei. Some of their stories are quite interesting. "

They give you clothes to wear so that you don't get your own all slimy when you play the game and they have showers available for afterwards. At one point I had to root around in a vat of slime blindfolded to find an egg and crack it on my head. When I found it, it felt like a ping-pong ball, so I didn't think it would really crack. It did, and I had slime and egg running through my hair. The expression on my face in the playback was priceless.

If they don't get a certain shot or if someone messes up a shot they'll re-film the audience later.

"I think that isis/daesh couldnt be more unislamic. Shoot they can call themselves whatever they want but in no way do they act according to Islam. For example suicide is a serious sin yet its something their members practice a little too much. They just targeted one of the most holy sites for Muslims so at this point if youre still associating daesh with islam i have serious concerns about your ability to rationalize. 

It breaks my heart when i see their name on the news because i know theres been another attack. I pray that they get whats coming to when. I hate how people can be so ignorant and think they represent islam. I hate how there are people living in fear because of them. I hate how people die because of them. I hate how people never seem to care if daesh targets muslims but the world mourns the death of westerners. 

Im from iran and irans government is against daesh. I live in america and hope that people start to realize islam and daesh are not synonymous. "
"Let me tell you why you need to evaluate yourself. No one asked for this story, so it is a bit weird to randomly dump this. Weird things you name: Hilary running for president as a sign of women taking over all jobs, when it would only be the first time they actually had a chance for the job at all. Action groups that even have a a female majority are pretty rare, one movie is not an example of a trend.  I would also recommend to cut down on trying to explain modern dating with a vague evolutionary statements, it makes guys sound desperate, like they follow bad pick-up artist books. It makes them sound very uninvolved with real life. Women being allowed to choose their partner is in many places a new thing, people still alive remember how women had to be chaperoned on dates or the father just decided who she would marry. Many of even the most progressive West European countries have only outlawed marital rape 20-10 years ago or didn't allow married women to own their own bank account. Equal right doesn't mean equal chances, racism didn't just suddenly disappear when segregation wasn't allowed by law anymore. There are still many religious institutions that see women as inferior and even with laws in place that should give women equal rights there are still outdated mindsets that have a negative influence on how they are treated."

"I'm not good with storytelling so here's a writeup from an article about Russell Swan:

&gt; The most dramatic event in Survivor history has to go to Russell Swan during his time on Survivor: Samoa... Russell is seen ‘resting’ on his corner of the table maze much to the disgust of his team mates who think he is slowing them down. Russell then proceeds to collapse and fall to the ground at which point Jeff calls medical in. It turns out that his blood pressure was dangerously low which was due to dehydration. Despite his pleas that he is okay, he is pulled from the game. Due to the life threatening situation he was in, Russell Swan deserves this top spot as the most serious accident! Even Jeff Probst has admitted that it is the scariest scenario he has ever seen.

As to the Kaoh Rong episode, three players from each tribe suffered from heat stroke after finishing the challenge. Two of them recovered fast as they only needed shade and water to lower their body temperature, while the other one had to be medically evacuated because his condition was getting worse that he had to be covered in ice, hooked to an IV, and needed an oxygen mask to breathe. There were around 100 production team members visible on tv catering to the needs of the castaways.

But the same argument could be made in favor for trains: ""America is a huge country, and you want every single person to own a car and transport themselves to each destination? As the population grows, we're just going to have to keep building bigger roads. Why wouldn't we set up a system that transports a lot of people at once?""

I dunno. I'm not an engineer, so I'm not sure if my scaling train systems upwards is perfectly sound, but it just seems like it would be better if we didn't have to individually drive everywhere we go. I suppose I'm just tired of driving on the interstate, tired of passing by horrible wrecks, tired of big 18-wheelers (our freight system using the same system as our individual drivers also seems like a bad idea) passing me recklessly so they can do their job, tired of sitting in traffic.

"What the fuck did you just print out to show me, sir? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at University of Phoenix, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the breakroom, and I have over 300 confirmed faxes. I am trained in manilla warfare and I’m the top printer in the entire regional office. You are nothing to me but just another supervisor. I will print you the fuck out reports with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with handing me that paper? Think again, sir. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of HR reps and your resume is being scrutinized right now so you better prepare for the call from HR, sir. The call that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your job. You’re going to get fucking fired, sir. I can report you to HR anywhere, anytime, and I can get you fired in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my false accusations. Not only am I extensively trained in sexual harassment, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the American Civil Liberties Union and I will use it to its full extent to get your miserable ass job off the face of the division, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “concerning” printout was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit toner all over you and you will drown in it. You’re going to get fired, sir."

"Oh, that's actually the worst - the people who are pro-life but then complain about social programs that are meant to help out children and women who need help supporting their children. And they're like ""well you should've thought about that before you got pregnant!"" which helps no one, and I think begs the response ""Well maybe I should have, but I knew I couldn't take care of this baby so that's why I wanted an abortion!""

I know that paragraph doesn't cover every possible view point, I just hate those hypocrites that bitch about abortions, single mothers, mothers on welfare, children on welfare, and other social programs without thinking ""Wait, I'm being shortsighted here."""

"This wasn't the comment this thread needed, but the one it deserved."
"I had the same experience. In 2003 I was working for a large scientific organisation. The windows had gold shielding and they prevented mobile phone signals getting through unless you were in the stairwell. I was walking downstairs and my phone went mental. Everyone was calling me at the same time. A light plane had crashed in the front yard of our (my parents') house. 

The female pilot had read the reading on the fuel dipstick wrong and had accidentally taken off with almost no fuel. When she realised her mistake she tried to turn around but didn't make it back to the airport. They needed to leave the crash site intact for the investigators to arrive the next day so we had to sleep in our house metres away from a wrecked plane with a body in it. To be fair, they did offer to put us up in a hotel. 

A security guard was hired to guard the wreckage because unfortunately there are scumbags out there who are desperate to collect pieces of plane wreckage as souvenirs; pieces from a fatal crash or the parts with the (rego?) number are apparently more desirable. Two of these pricks hovered around the front yard all through the night, presumably waiting for the security guard to let his guard down. Also there were a lot of people coming around to look, but I didn't care; I would have been curious too. The next day they carried out the investigation and the body was removed. They warned us they were about to remove the body and we should not look out the windows for a while but of course I did anyway. It was just a middle-aged woman with pink/red where her face should be. It wasn't gross; it was just...there. I sort of expected to recoil in horror or something but I suppose it looked exactly like what I thought it would look like. It probably helped that everyone who was involved was very calm, considerate (of us), and professional."

"I didn't, but sometimes I wish I did. 

We dated briefly in high school and broke up over some silly shit that I just wish she was more honest with me about. She didn't understand how much I loved her...I didn't either. 

When I first met her, I literally went home and prayed to God the Bart Simpson prayer,  ""God, if you're real, you'll make her love me and we'll get married"".

She is the only person in my life with whom I have been, and felt I could be 100% honest about everything. 

When I had a bad day, I would go for a walk at night and look at the stars and wonder if she still took the time to look at them...like we used to.  She was the golden standard for women for me, but I knew she deserved way better than me!!

So when she got my number from my parents and told me she had cancer, I was in disbelief. 

She was fine, it was in her breasts, she had a procedure, then invited me to visit, which I did. 

I had started dating a girl at this time. 

When my grandfather was dying in the hospital, my girlfriend stayed at our apartment, but was sure to call and fight with me about some stupid shit. My friend drove to the hospital to support me. 

When one of our mutual friends died unexpectedly, we met at the funeral.  We talked for hours.  I shared some poetry with her, she read some of it back to me. 

I accidentally told her I loved her.   She told me she loved me, too.

This sent me into a fevered panic.  Things were serious with my GF, but now everything felt different.  The passion evaporated. I thought maybe it was depression from my friend's senseless death. 

Anyway, I visited her the night I went to pick up the ring I was going to use to propose to my GF.  I was going to spend the night with her. Just one last go, give our a full shot to see if I was making a mistake. We were gonna fuck like crazed people and I was going to tell her I still love her and want to make it work.

We didn't fuck, I chickened out. I didn't even spend the night. I felt too guilty lying to my GF. I did go over and visit. She was looking fine.  We watched some tv. We did some dishes.  We talked. We argued about who broke up with whom.  She was convinced I broke up with her, and I did not. 

She got her guitar out and sang to me. Songs off of a CD I shared with her because it made me think of her back when we were dating. I shared a couple poems with her. 

We hugged, I gave her a kis, I left. I dropped by the next day with a gift, it was her birthday. Told her how much I was going to miss her and how grateful I was for the time with her. 

She wanted to be a part of my life with my gf\fiance, but understood my reluctance considering our past, and said when I was ready, she would be there. 

So we slowly lost touch for a few years.  In that time I got married, owned a business, got a very good job, nice house, got my wife pregnant. 

Then she reached out. To check on me, see how I was how things worked out with the girl.  I was excited, and I was sick. Literally physically sick with anxiety.

To make it a shorter ending, I told her how I felt, she told me she wasn't going to tell me how she felt because she isn't a homewrecker.

It's been 3 years and we're best friends. She's dating a guy she needs to leave and is worried she won't have kids.  I need to go to counseling with my wife to work on our marriage.  

Sometimes I fantasize about starting over with her, but I'm too chicken to do it.  She calls me a peace maker, willing to suffer my own problems to keep the relationship happy.

Anyway.  I should have come clean before so much was at stake. 

Getting back in touch hurt my marriage, but enriched my life tremendously.  I tried to get my wife to agree to meet her, and told her how much she meant to me...funny enough my wife refused to go and that really hurt our marriage. 

Fucking sucks.  I have so much in life, I am very fortunate and am very grateful and should be happy, but I'm not,  because I worry that the one thing I want more than anything else could have been mine, if I had just asked."
That eventually I'll see my parents as become as old and frail as I remember my grandparents being.

"Other countries are free to use another country's currency, as I alluded to North Korea doing so for a lot of their international purchases.  The problem though is that if you're using another country's currency you don't have control over it, nor can you print it.  So for example if Country A uses Country B's currency and Country B decides they want to spike inflation by printing a lot of currency for some obscure reason, Country A will also feel the same effects and may not be in a position to weather it as well as Country B.  

Basically you can do it but you're dumb if you do.  You have no control over one of the most important aspects of your economy.

"Honestly, my lack of love life"
"I know a woman who met her husband at a dance while he about to be shipped off to fight in WWII.  He had 7 days left. He said she may as well marry him. They were both from small towns.  If he died, she'd  be a soldier's widow with benefits.  If he lived, he'd come home and they would travel the world, promise.  So she married him 5 days after she met him at a dance, and he shipped off.

He survived, came home, built a life and career, did VERY well for himself and the family. Traveled the world with her. Bought vineyards.  Bought a vacation home in a tropical country. She never truly loved him, though, and had affairs frequently, the longest one lasting something like 10-15 years with who she called the ""real love of her life.""

He always had his suspicions but never wanted to admit it, until he couldn't ignore it anymore.   I don't recall what happened which forced him to face it.

He says he's buying an estate across the world and was leaving to go.  If she wanted to stay married, she had to come, but never speak to or see the lover again.  Be his wife, and no one's lover.  Period.  He still wanted her.

Now, he wasn't the nicest man in the world, true.  Really cantankerous and hard to get along with, but still, that didn't mean he deserved to be cheated on, when he still thought she was the hottest ticket in town and was faithful to her. 

So she thinks about it, errs on the side of the money of course, and breaks up with the lover and moves with him across the world and starts life anew.  There, they lived for about 10 years, until he passed away.'

The first thing she did was call the lover and say she was now free and they could be together.  Except he had gotten married by now, to woman he'd met and married 6 months after the break-up.

She said she wasn't surprised he was married, but that he did it only 6 months later wounded her. 

She has spent the last several years roaming about on senior travel trips, screwing anything that doesn't have a rash, having affairs with husbands in the community, and essentially wearing the badge of Town Cougar with pride.

TL:DR:  Kinda an opposite set-up. She married a man within 5 days just in case he died in WWII and she'd get benefits. He lived, and she spent the rest of their marriage, all but 10 years, cheating on him."
Phrasing!

"Similarly in high school, I worked at the local humane society in the ""incoming"" section, where people who found lost animals, or wanted to give up their own pets were to come and drop them off.  
That included people who wanted to euthanize their animals, too.   
I'll never forget this cute old couple who came in to euthanize this beautiful collie that was probably just as old as them. The old lady holding the door open as the old man scooted the collie into the room. The collie was so old she couldn't walk, so the couple thought it best to put her down humanely.   
Seeing the couple cry as we took their dog away was so heartbreaking.   
  
Similar things happened a lot. Military families who were being sent to another part of the world, and they couldn't bring their dog with them. All the kids crying and hugging their pet dog while their parents tried to look strong and hold back their own tears.

"My wife and i did, but it was kind of a coincidence.

We have known each other since she was 12 and i was 18. We always had a thing for each other, but given the age gap and the distance (600 km) we decided that it was not a good idea to ever start anything relationship-wise (we didnt even meet IRL until she was 17). We made the pact with 14/20 when she was all like ""i will never get a man"". We agreed that, if both of us are single when she is 18, we will marry each other.

When I was 23 i just got out of a year-long abusive relationship, and she (17) also had very bad first relationship experiences at the same time and quit at the same time. At that point we decided that we had nothing to loose and just gave it a shot and meet for the first time IRL.

Everything instantly clicked. Fast forward 6 months and we move in together. Fast forward another 6 months and we are married. By coincidence this was according to our pact.

We are now both extremely happy. Together we were able to beat depression, beat financial struggle, beat every obstacle we ever encountered. It became obvious that we have been meant for each other from the very beginning.

She is 21 now and I am 27. We could not be happier at this point in our lives."

"No, you've just told me that the only thing of worth I can do for this world is shit out a child.

You have no idea of the amount of people who rely on me, how I have helped others or what I do. If you think a man can change the world despite not having children, it's the same for a woman. 

I actually do get you on the issue of falling birth rates in the west. My objection is to you deciding that is the problem of women alone, or that if we are not incubators, we are useless. 

I'm not fond of people in general outside those I love. My island has a crowded infrastructure and it's virtually impossible to find social housing, afford a mortgage or drive on the roads for any amount of time without getting stuck in an hour-long gridlock, to say nothing of zero hour contracts for workers. I would never bring a child up in such circumstances unless I was filthy rich and support was in place. My mother had five children and we lived in poverty. She has told me many times that she regrets having so many children and so young; I completely understand her.

Many animals will kill their young when faced with overcrowding and scarcity of resources; thankfully we have evolved to decide whether or not to breed."

I have an anger problem that I can usually control, so I've never sought help and most of my friends don't know (I think). One night, a big group of us were playing some board game. They were having fun, but I was too focused on the rules not being followed. I made a big scene and left the room. They thought I was joking around, so one of my friends grabbed my sleeve and tried to pull me back. I turned on him and nearly punched him in the face. I saw the look on his face turn from smiling to realization, and he let go.   
I knew I couldn't explain any of this, and that I would have to admit my problem in order to face it. My girlfriend came into the room to try and comfort me. Didn't even say anything. I was sullen and didn't aknowledge her. The thought occurred to me that I could blame it all on my knowing I was going to break up with her later that night. So I did. I called each and every friend later on and apologized, explaining I broke up with Penny that night. They all understood. "

His respirations had slowed to where he would take one agonal breath every 60 seconds and when he did this his upper body would spasm lifting up out of the bed.

After we've been there a couple of hours it was time to take a break. My friend came to ask me if I was ready to go to breakfast.

"I used to be on mail duty at the payroll office of a large NHS trust, responsible for many of the smaller trusts up to 60 miles away and so there was a shit load of post, especially when the monthly timesheets were piling in along with the weekly paid staffs sheets.

It would take around 3 hours to get through the morning post. Then at 1pm you'd get the afternoon post. All whilst trying to manage my own payroll section. I was solely responsible for around 140 staffs wages myself, 100 of them weekly paid and the other 40 were cadet nurses, monthly paid.

Stressful as hell trying to sort out what staff gets what timesheet as all I had to go on was what the staff member put down as their job title.

Aux nurse and your surname is in the first half of the alphabet? Right, you go to Ruth.

Consultant in xray department? Sheila.

Head nurse to the other 3rd nurse in four departments over? Well that's not a proper job title.. Time to search on your payroll number on the incredibly slow system to see who is responsible for you.

Then you'd have to go around handing the post out to everybody. Nobody liked it, there were no 'ohhh you, stop bringing me more work ya little rascal'. None of that sarcastic tone or anything. Everybody genuinely took a dislike to you for dishing out the work. People would tut as you handed it over. People would kick off and run straight to management if 1 of the 400 time sheets you just handed them belonged to Julie sat on the desk behind them."

"Kind of late to the party but got one of these too. It doesn't end well tho, so you can skip it if you're looking for happy endings.

This happened more than 20 years ago.

So, although I'm not gipsy I grew up being very close friends with a family of gipsies with 7 kids living across the street. 

I was 17 and during the summer I was making some money on the side helping them sell all kind of imported goods at the flea market. I was working for 25% of what I was selling ( well I was a family friend not really employee) so I was making really nice money. My parents didn't like it much but I couldn't care less. 

So moving around from town to down depending what was the flea market day I met this gipsy girl. Blonde curly hair, blue eyes, the face of an angel. We connected immediately. She was incredibly smart and - contrary to gipsy tradition/way of life - her dad was insisting on her getting a good education. Her dream was to become a surgeon.

We kept in touch during that summer vacation, we met a few more times, then school started again and sort of without anyone knowing we started dating. It was a big risk for both of us. Gipsies have pretty strict laws about how and whom can you date and with stingy consequences so ... yeah, we had to play it pretty well.

Year passes and we both go to college in different cities. Two days before the start of the freshman year she calls this pact: if by the end of college we're still alone we're going to get together and fight the system (gipsy laws and traditions) to get married. She sort of got a wild card not getting married young as the gipsy tradition asked for because of her studies, her father fought hard in the gipsy community and wasn't in a great position for going against the tradition. But he had a vision for his daughter and was willing to give it everything to make it happen. Us officialy getting together would have been a nuke drop into an already very volatile sittuation.

We kept in touch only through brief calls whenever she could call me from a public phone. My whole life at that point was revolving around those calls. I would get out of classes or skip classes whenever she would call me. I had to support consequences for it but I didn't care. All was good, we seem to get along well, she was happy I was happy. For a about 2 weeks or so the calls stopped, but she warned me this will happen because of some family issues so I wasn't worried.

After about 12 days I get a letter from her. A really long one and as soon as I opened it I knew it wasn't good. I could clearly see the paper messed up in some places from her tear drops. I thought ""well, this is it, she either got caught, he father couldn't fight off the marriage requests or she can't do it anymore"". 

But it was worse. Soooo much worse...

She explained me how she got sick some days before she stopped calling me, went to a doctor , did some tests and came out she had a really aggressive form of leukemia ... Her dad was taking her in one of the western european countries to try a treatment  and basically this was her goodbye letter to me. 

I could not go visit/see her in the hospital (needed a visa I could not possibly get). I could not ask her family members about her status. I just had to wait and hope she will be ok. 

I never saw her again. She died in the hospital 4 months later."

"When I was a drill sergeant, the parents of one of my cycles were out of control on the Facebook page for our unit. We were required to post 3 pictures a week. That's what my CO did, 3 a week. By week 3, most of the parents had called complaining that their little shithead kid wasn't in any of the pictures. We would have to explain that we took a few pictures, but our focus was training, not social media. The commander decided after the 15th call that they shouldn't be allowed to comment either, so he turned comments on the page off. The parents created a private Facebook group, invited the battalion CSM and commander, and told him how mean we were for not taking pictures of their fucking kids. Luckily, they just cited the regulation that said we only needed 3 pictures.

At graduation, the parents that were super involved pretty much mobbed my CO and told him how awful he was. I had more privates stay at the battery during family day and graduation that cycle than any other. Obviously those kids knew their parents were terrible. Army parents are just as bad as Navy parents when it comes to their precious little soldier."

" I was let into an evaluation room. I made friends with the woman taking my info. She really liked me. I signed some forms that I didn't read signing away my rights. The walls were thin and I heard her talking to someone higher up. She was saying how I was such a good kid, so smart and how she felt wrong doing what she was doing. The lead doctor (?) said even smart people need help. I was taken through some doors. I was put in a room. A male nurse stood outside. I was forced to undress. This is my biggest fear. At least it wasn't female nurse. They asked me which I'd prefer and I told them a male. He watched me as I stripped and inspected my naked body. I given neutral colored plain garments. I was lead into a room with a number of people. I sat on a chair. They gave me a blanket. I rocked back and forth and stared into the nothingness. An intake psychologist interviewed me. She was a total bitch. She was so mean to me. I was very upset. When I got back to the room with the other people, I was asked to go to these meetings. I refused. I would not tolerate being treated as I had been. I would not cooperate with people like that. I was very popular there though. I got to know everyone and why they were there. I started writing my book using the people there as characters. I thought for a little while I was meant to write the next book of the bible (even though I'm an atheist). I was really popular with all of the nurses. My mom visited me a few times, but my step-dad did not. I did not know why and I didn't think to ask for a few days. It turns out that I had cut him with that knife when I pressed it to his wrist. The officer that got me in the ambulance said he had enough to prosecute me. I know that I did not mean to do it and he decided to not go forward with the case.

My mind cleared after a few days on the medication that they gave me. I could think again. This was about 3-4 days after the worst day of my life. I was kept another 5-6 days because I refused to cooperate with them after that really bitchy intake nurse who I still resent (I very much want her fired, it was completely inappropriate and unprofessional how she acted). I was diagnosed as Bipolar. I got out, but I was still off. I invited a friend to my house and I guess I was crazy enough still to scare him off as I haven't heard from him since (although I think he might be gay and thought that I was inviting him over for sex idk). I tried to talk to Nina, but she didn't respond. I wrote the shittiest 4 chapters of a book that I have ever done in my life (even going back to the stuff I wrote in 4th grade). It was vulgar, completely out of my style. I haven't been able to bring myself to write again. The universe that I was writing in was one that I had developed in high school and now it was ruined, the memories of it forever embittered by my mental breakdown. The psychiatrist that I was given was a Bangledeshi named Dr. Ramen, who did not like me. He overmedicated me and I lived in a gloom for the next few years. I did poorly in school, because I had stopped caring about life. I had lost the girl of my dreams. I gained back the weight I lost my freshman year. I smoked a lot of pot. I was, and am, a loser. About a year ago, I got a new psychiatrist. He initially kept me on the same medications that Ramen had me on, but realized they were too much. He switched me to a different mood stabilizer. I started to feel a little better, but still bad. I quit smoking pot, but it didn't help. I missed a lot of class last year and only got in a few credit hours, no D's, but no A's either. 

A few months ago, he took me off of the medication that is meant to stop me from going manic believing that my manic episode had been triggered by the experimental anti-depressant that I was on and that my mode would be improved. He also had put me on a different anti-depressant than one that I took prior to the manic episode. When I came off of the manic stablizer I began to feel better. I stopped taking the anti-depressant. I feel pretty good now. Not too good thankfully, but good enough. I should have graduated last year, but due to all of the struggles that I've had I'm behind in school, and I changed my major just last semester. I have only two classes scheduled in the fall. I'm still afraid I won't attend, but I do feel better and I am hopeful and somewhat happy for the first time since that episode. I have a job that I do not miss, so I don't know why I would miss class, but I'm still nervous. 

I'm 22, I have no friends (although I'm starting to make some at work), I'm 60 pounds overweight, I'm way in debt (still paying off that hospital visit), I think about Nina a few times a week (even though I wish I could forget her), and although my life's dream has always been to write a book (and I have a pretty good idea for one) I am not doing so (it wouldn't matter very much though as I'm a poor writer). Anyways, that was really cathartic. I know that at best, maybe one person reads this all the way through and thank you to that person. You are the first person who I've talked to about this other than my parents and the therapists I've talked to. I'll carry the scars of the day for a lifetime. Nina's face will linger in my mind until I fall in love again (which is something I have not pursued since, I had an opportunity with a dental hygienist a few months after the manic episode, but it was too soon; I do have a crush on this really sweet girl at my work though, but she's way out of my league right now; I'm going to ask her out in 6-10 months after I've lost this weight, but I know it won't work out, because she's very religious and she wants to go to a college in a different state- she currently going to a community college by me).

"People who say it's boring are missing the entire message of the movie! Back in 68, space travel was romanticised to its breaking point by science fiction (Star Trek is a key example) and NASA's achievements. When people back then thought of outer space they thought about aliens, laser pistols, and exotic planets.

2001 completely shattered these fantasies about outer space. Kubrick's attention to detail showed the American public the true reality of space travel. That its boring and filled with more horror than optimism. There's no space princesses, no battles between intergalactic empires, and no aliens to befriend. Space travel in reality is just a small crew in a tube waiting tirelessly for their next destination on a mission that a machine could have probably done alone.

There are plenty of other messages littered throughout the film. but I imagine Ridley Scott took the message about the reality of space to heart when he worked on Alien. "

"[Here's a list of at least 156 people convicted and sentenced to death and later exonerated since 1973.](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-and-death-penalty)

Sure, a lot of people who commit violent crimes deserve revenge, but the court system wrongly convicts too many people. We know that innocent people have been killed using the death penalty, and if the death penalty continues then more innocent people will be killed because of it.

If we support a system which if continued will inevitably continue to kill innocent people then are we better than the killers we sentence to death?"

My solid tip is to carefully research prior sales in the neighborhood before you make an offer.  Most county property appraisers websites can give you lots of information about recent sales.  Pick some comparables and drive around and look at them yourself.  Come up with a truly honest price per square foot for the neighborhood and see what kind of deal you are getting.  Make your offer accordingly.   Try not to allow emotion to enter into the process.  It's first and foremost a business decision.

"There's an in-between to all of this that a lot of people will screw up for lack of awareness or intelligence.  About 8 years ago, my coworker and I both made the same salary of $50,000.  My coworker was always complaining about being broke.  He had a wife and no children, his wife also worked and made about $40,000.  Combined they were always ""broke"".  I was single, never bought new cars, only bought used with cash, didn't go out as much, hunkered down and erased my student loans within 2 years of leaving college, quickly had no debts and began to accumulate around $75,000 in savings over the next 3 years.  I keep this to myself while every day my coworker is bitching about how life isn't fair and he can barely afford the bills, and he's got credit card payments, student loan payments, needs his parents to help with his student loans, bitches about gas prices.  Etc Etc.  And here I am sitting debt free with $75 grand in the bank.  Both same salary.  Here's my point.  You don't need to be making 6 figures+ to have 30 grand sitting around.  You simply have to setup your life where whatever you make, you live on about half of it, or **at most**, 2/3's of it.  That is to say, if you cant take at least 1/3 of your actual take-home pay and shove it under a rock to forget about for a few years, then you fucked up and need to start taking steps backwards to free up some money.  If you can't afford to do that, you're either living too extravagantly or living in a place with terrible cost of living.  A lot of people buy a home way too soon in their life, when they're still half retarded, and sign off on too high of a mortgage with too low of a downpayment, then they wonder why they can't save money, they bought into a life that they couldn't afford.  Setup your life so you can easily afford it, and **after** you have debt erased and cash accumulated, build up your life as needed from there.  The goal should be owing $0 payments to anyone and then begin saving at a very high rate.  The only car you can afford is the one you can buy with cash today, that way you own it and can use liability insurance which is about half the price of full coverage and save even more."

As for ""normal"" people, you're right. We all have issues. It's difficult to relate to someone with a mental disability without truly understanding why someone's brain works the way it does. 

One hypothesis for schizophrenia I found interesting was a timing issue in the brain. There is an experiment where you take a ""normal"" person and have them do something like push a button which corresponds with something happening on screen. If you change the settings so there is a slight delay or the delay is near instantaneous, you can trick a person into thinking they did not push the button when they actually did. 

If you extrapolate that idea and say *maybe* certain thoughts could be delayed, would a person think those thoughts originated elsewhere? For instance, my uncle spontaneously laughs occasionally and completely unprovoked. I wonder if he thinks of a little joke or something, but because there's a delay he attributes it to someone or something else.

It reminds me of tourettes but he doesn't say these jokes and when I ask him what is funny he always avoids answering.

- **Client:** Ok, what if we don't like the logo?
- **Me:** Well, I'll go back and do another round of sketches until we find something you do like. 
- **Client:** Yes but let's say you send us the final version and then later we decide we don't like it, do we still have to pay?
- **Me:** Well, yes when I send you the final version you will need to pay, even if you don't end up using it.
- **Client:** OH. But what are we paying for in that case?
- **Me:** My time? My work?

"My first steps to the fantasy world were with ""The Diamond Throne"". Though, after finishing it I thought I needed at least few more years to truly appreciate it (I was 8 I think) so I tried Belgariad.

And Elenium &amp; Tamuli is one of the greatest series. Every 6 months or so I start reading it again.

Note: 2 years ago I saw whole Belgariad + Malloreon books + a big map for $15 on my country's biggest bookstore. It was truly sad.

As to the first part, government welfare does keep people in poverty, in at least two ways. First, if they're marginally motivated to get and keep a job, the availability of welfare benefits can kill that little bit of motivation.  Second, if they're highly motivated workers and their income increases, [their welfare benefits can be phased out so rapidly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_trap) that they don't see a penny of whatever raise they manage to earn."

And if I'd been in the 99th percentile or higher there (also probably higher), I could've gone to the olympics. And if I'd succeeded there, I probably would still not be able to make a living purely with wrestling (maybe as a coach). So no dreams of winning anything past high school."

"Mine was work related. I managed a database for a very old-fashioned company, nearly everybody there knew absolutely nothing about computers, let alone a database. 

A woman asked me to generate a moderately difficult report for her based on information that, after querying, did not exist in the database. She continued to tell me how ""I was doing something wrong because we used similar information last year."" I literally proved to her, through screenshots and bright red arrows, that the information did not exist. She told me ""you might want to get someone else to help you, clearly you don't know what you're doing."" 

After I proved to her that it wasn't there. Turns out the information she was looking for was stored somewhere completely separate from the in-house database, she just wasn't versed enough to know that information comes from more than one source. I never helped her with anything after that. Good times. "

They don't forget as long as you make them do the trick a few times a day for the first week or so. After that, you can go weeks without repeating the same command, and they will remember what to do every time.

"I am not disagreeing with the overall point of your comment. But in this instance, the Secretary of State was not at fault.

I am pulling this quote directly from a comment made by /u/A_Crabby_Patty yesterday.

Here are some key excerpts from the report released yesterday. For the most part it seems as if the military as at fault. 

Despite President Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta’s clear orders to deploy military assets, nothing was sent to Benghazi, and nothing was en route to Libya at the time the last two Americans were killed almost 8 hours after the attacks began. [pg. 141]

With Ambassador Stevens missing, the White House convened a roughly two-hour meeting at 7:30 PM, which resulted in action items focused on a YouTube video, and others containing the phrases “[i]f any deployment is made,” and “Libya must agree to any deployment,” and “[w]ill not deploy until order comes to go to either Tripoli or Benghazi.” [pg. 115]

The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff typically would have participated in the White House meeting, but did not attend because he went home to host a dinner party for foreign dignitaries. [pg. 107]

A Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team (FAST) sat on a plane in Rota, Spain, for three hours, and changed in and out of their uniforms four times. [pg. 154]

None of the relevant military forces met their required deployment timelines. [pg. 150]

The Libyan forces that evacuated Americans from the CIA Annex to the Benghazi airport was not affiliated with any of the militias the CIA or State Department had developed a relationship with during the prior 18 months. Instead, it was comprised of former Qadhafi loyalists who the U.S. had helped remove from power during the Libyan revolution. [pg. 144]

Granted some people won't make the first move, like my buddy he won't text first but always follows through with putting things aside. Other people I know don't at all so I stopped talking to them all together, no matter how much I wanted the friendship to last. "
You're goddamn right we do.
"Unlikely, EU have stipulated that in order to have access to the single market, Britain must adhere to all four of the market's ""freedoms"" including freedom of movement. 

This is the part that will be the sticky wicky. Many of the Brexit voters voted out of the EU because they believe freedom of movement has led to a rise in immigration, one in which is taking jobs from ordinary Brits (I don't agree with this belief, but it's a strong one - particularly among the disenfranchised working class)

If we were to stay in the single market, and adhered to all four freedoms, the Leave campaigners may face a backlash from their voters (a kind of ""well what was the point?"" mentality). And whoever next becomes prime minister will have difficulty trying to persuade Leave voters with the single market, even if they were Remain or Leave. If they're Leave, they'll look like they backtracked on their entire campaign for political leverage, if they're Remain, they'll look like they are trying to find a way of having some part of Britain's fingers in EU pies. 

This is to say the EU will even let us have access to the single market when negotiations get drawn up. On one side, we do have a strong economy that would benefit the EU. One the other side, the EU will likely remove us from every EU benefit to teach Britain a lesson and send a message out to any other EU country considering to leave. 

The EU will first and foremost protect their own interests. They say they want a ""quick"" divorce from Britain, but I get the sense that when they mean quick, they mean as in how you would kill a suffering animal. Quick, fast, ruthless. They want to make an example of us, and one of the best ways of doing this would be to cut us off from everything, and watch us economically starve in the process. "

"Very dry, not as in-your-face as in the U.S. The jokes are often a story, sometimes with complex story lines - and virtually no puns. Often, the humor is political, and when it does take a lighter turn, it is making light of a dark situation. Sometimes, its saying unexpected truths and laughing.

"""The Show Must Go On"" - Queen. The story behind it has been fairly well publicized, but for the uninitiated Freddy Mercury was so weak he could barely stand during the recording of it due to his AIDS really setting in. Quote from Brian May on it, ""I said, 'Fred, I don't know if this is going to be possible to sing.' And he went, 'I'll fucking do it, darling' — vodka down — and went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal.""

The song was released 6 weeks before he died. Listening to the song, it's painfully obvious who the subject is. You can easily picture him in the recording booth, barely strong enough to stand, but able to kill it in a single take.

I'm anti-physical punishment, and learned ways to discipline effectively in the daycare I work at: you can have a good amount of success by using a behavior issue as a teachable moment (like taking the time to explain ways to cope with stress, giving them an alternate idea of how to handle it, and having them repeat it and use it). I also redirect misbehaving kids to a quiet activity. The easiest way to diffuse a tantrum is to ignore until they can verbally tell you why they are upset, but keep an eye on them. 

Spanking was never effective on me either. I also find it crazy that a reasonable adult would never suggest to hit another adult to fix their behavior, yet kids are okay to hit, even though they don't all have the skills necessary to behave their best and make good choices, and are still learning."

"&gt; The argument is that 36% of a misinformed electorate shouldn't be enough to change our economy and the lives of millions.

There are major ramifications no matter what the result was. Remain wouldn't have meant no change because there'll be lots of reforms to be pushed for and the nature of reforms would become a hot political issue.

And who exactly made you the judge of how ""informed"" the electorate is? There are stupid people on both sides of the debate, and both sides will have had supporters who voted that way for questionable reasons. Or is the electorate only ""informed"" if they agree with you?

"I personally have not got past it. For me it becomes much more of an issue when I become happy - It feels like I do not deserve this happiness. 

To be fair it is all about the journey. You have to look past what is in front of you. You must keep moving forward. If you can't run - you walk and if you can't walk then you crawl - but you do whatever you can to move forward. You have to believe that it will get better and to become content with yourself.

Don't let yourself fall into a spiral - put safeguards in place. For example I have an individual who will ring me If I don't turn up to a sports club for a while. This individual is way older than me but it helps me. You get into a routine and you work at it. Work at it and keep going."

"Uh, mostly fear of failing and being ""that chick who tried to kill herself"" for the rest of my life, possibly with serious medical problems because I can't even kill myself right. So I never tried. 

I'm feeling much better now, don't want to kill myself, but still don't really want to live out my life. Whenever there's a big disaster and people die I get sad because I feel like it's unfair that these people with lives they wanted to live are dead, and here I am wanting not to have to live my life, and wouldn't everything have been so much better if I could have taken their place. 

It all seems like so much effort for so little reward. I've been depressed and suicidal for more than two thirds of my life, since I was a child, and I know that I'll get worse and better and worse and better and through all that I have to struggle to pay rent, get past my loneliness, find a career, help my friends and family. I feel guilty because all these opportunities I have are wasted on me, my fucked up brain chemistry won't let me genuinely appreciate them, though obviously intellectually I know how lucky I am. "

I said, ""do you want to talk to her? I can give you her phone number."" 

Being Miss Sunglass store investigator, she said she doesn't have her phone number. And she also said they have security cameras in the store so they could see if I made an illegitimate purchase.

He ended up losing and in the exit interview he looked like he was in complete disbelief. Mumbled a few things that I can't remember that generally pissed me off. He also sabotaged this other chick who looked like the sweetest woman over who was struggling because she was distracted by her son being ill. She ended up winning which made me pretty happy. I really hope it was real, if my memory is correct she was a cooking instructor.

Don't remember his (sir douchebag's) name, but I remember during the intro he had a plate of bone marrow (or maybe it was on the actual show?) Literally it was a giant chunk of bone marrow in the bone about the size of a forearm with a few raw veggies beside it. "

"I lived above a bar that got picked for the show ""Bar Rescue"" and can say 90% of that show is phony, not to mention that  their production crew was a gromup of asshats. The bar they picked was in a very working class, blue collar part of town that did not jive well with most of the people filming and always seemed to piss off somebody. The show was crazily phony too with trucked in actors to make drama on the production nights. The night of the first reveal had a ratio of 25% locals to 75% actors inside, with the actors receiving texts to throw drinks and yell throughout the night. It was an extra nightmare for myself because for two weeks I was constantly getting my car trapped in with their equipment and lights shined directly into my apartment.   The shittiest part was that the rehab priced all of my friends out of their bar for our weekly gatherings. I used to get scotch and sodas the size of my head for $2.50, good times.  "

"A lot of this is simply untrue.

Norway accepts around 10% of EU law. Most of that is EEA trading regulation since they only have to accept EEA laws and choose whether to adopt laws created for the EU. 90% of EEA law comes from the WTO so everyone has to accept it anyway.

In terms of budget Norway pays into a separate budget for the EFTA. The reason they pay so much money (they pay 80% per head, not gross) is because Norway decides to opt into paying for grants and extra development projects as well as something called ""Norway grants"". The UK would only be compelled to pay the EFTA fee which is considerably less than the EU fee.

Norway also DOES get a say in the laws that affect them. They are part of the drafting process for EEA law and get to help shape those laws. They do not get a vote on the laws however. They do, conversely have a seat in the WTO so they do get to influence WTO laws and regulations.

Perhaps the biggest and most crucial bonus that Norway gets over everyone in the EU is that they are free to negotiate their own trade deals with other independent countries either as a group (EFTA) or on it's own.

If the Norway deal was so shitty as you believe, ask yourself. Why do more than 70% of Norwegians support their current status over full EU membership?"

"About 7 years ago a friend of mine was on a reality show here in Canada called ""Last 10 Pounds"", where you were given a personal trainer and dietician and they follow your journey to losing the weight.

Real: She actually lost 10 pounds (maybe more).

Fake: Basically everything else. There's a scene where they go to your house and open the cupboards and throw away all your junk food while the dietician comments on it. The dietician was an actress and the food was planted. The workout scenes were almost all fake, because people actually working out doesn't look good on camera. The scene (which I was in!) where she was ""busted"" eating pizza at a work meeting with coworkers was actually filmed in her condo common room with friends posing as coworkers. Goes on and on. "

"Yeah, I was hoping to read his story, too. Because I apparently want to get really sad. 
From what I can tell, he once loved a girl very much before she was killed by a drunk driver.

EDIT: here ya go, courtesy of /u/crown118

Probably too late for this not to get buried, but I have a story about this.
We met in college, and were instant best friends. I was 20; she was 18. We spent all our time together, and were briefly lovers, but we never formally dated because both of us were very much into being wild and free and enjoying our youth. We dated other people on and off, but we talked about it and agreed that a committed relationship between the two of us would be an all-or-nothing kind of thing. Since neither of us wanted to give up our hedonistic, promiscuous, irresponsible lifestyle, we made a point of not committing to a relationship. A few years went by that way, and we were very happy, right up until her sisters died.

It was a car accident. They were 16 and 18, and both were killed in the crash. Dead on arrival at the hospital. My friend was utterly, completely devastated. It still hurts me to remember it, even now. Her father, though, was even more devastated, to the point where he was legitimately willing to let himself starve to death rather than try to go on living. She moved home, out of state, to take care of him. She cut ties with everyone for awhile, even me. I didn't see her again for two years.
She was so different after that. Before the accident, she'd always been the most joyful, exuberant, positive person I'd ever met. After she came back, she was quieter, sadder, maybe wiser. I wanted to be there for her more than I'd ever wanted anything in the world. Not being able to fix things for her, not being able to make it better, that hurt more than anything I could ever remember. I guess that's when I realized how in love with her I was.

I told her that I loved her, that I wanted to be there with her, and she told me that she couldn't handle the idea of any kind of emotional connection for awhile. Maybe a few years, she said. Maybe never. Maybe she'd never be able to open up emotionally again. She said she needed space from me, particularly from me. She said she needed to figure out what it meant to be alive in a world where her sisters were gone. She asked me to give her time, and I told her that I'd give her anything she wanted. She told me that she'd never been happier than she was when we were together. I told her the same. I told her that I understood, and that's when we made our pact. I was 25 then, and she was 23. We agreed: if she turned 30 and I turned 32, and if she had learned to heal, and if she hadn't fallen in love with someone else, and if I hadn't fallen in love with someone else, then we'd get married. So that's how we parted ways. She moved to Wyoming, to be alone. I moved to Germany, to get as far away from her as I could.
We didn't keep in touch at first, but over the next few years we built up a correspondence. We wrote letters because we both liked writing letters. We emailed now and then. Sometimes we'd mail each other books that we thought the other would like. Years went on, and we became closer and closer.
When I turned 30, I half-jokingly brought up our marriage pact. I told her that I hadn't ever fallen for anyone else. (I didn't mention this, but I couldn't have fallen for anyone else. I always compared every other woman to her, and in my memory she was perfect.) She replied that she was still very serious about our agreement, and that she'd never fallen in love with anyone else either. I asked her if she thought she had begun to heal, and she said she had, as much as a person could ever heal from something like that. A year later, she told me she'd like us to meet and spend some time together, to see if the spark was still there.

It was. She was living in California at that time, and I found a job there. I'd always wanted to live in California anyway. I proposed to her six months later, and she smiled and told me ""no fair"", that I had to wait another few months, when she'd be turning 30. I thought it was silly, but at that point things were going so well that a few months didn't seem like they could matter at all. But I'm crying now, so I'll have to wrap this up quickly.

She died. That's how the story ends. She was hit by a drunk driver and spent 2 days in the ICU before her body gave out. I went to her funeral. I spoke to her father but I barely remember what we said. I've never spoken to him since. I don't have the willpower to make myself find out how he's doing.
That will be four years ago this November. I'm in therapy and trying to learn how to have feelings again, other than blank, mindless, miserable rage. I often wonder if this is what it felt like for her. She made progress. She learned to feel again. That thought is what keeps me going. She did it. She'd want me to do it.

That's it. That's the story. It's a shitty story, and I hate it."

So, I tell them, because I assume they didn't already know. If they choose to say these things anyway, that's their prerogative.

And then they turn around and go ""well you're just an *SJW*"" because, I guess, rethinking one's actions is *hard* and it's easier to just assume that anyone who disagrees with them is wrong."

Back when the bride was a teenager she choreographed a dance routine for Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"". The DJ played it early on but there weren't many people around and the bride and groom were off having 'a moment' together.

Later on when the bride was back we decided the DJ should play it again, so we went to go request it, we met one of her friends who told us she'd already requested us, we figured strength in numbers so asked the DJ to play it again, he laughed at us but said he would.

When he did play it we had the bride in the middle, plus a broad range of people she'd met at different points in her life who she had taught this dance routine to. It was brilliant."

A lot of people were huge fucking assholes. 
But there was this one lady. Her family was obviously very wealthy. Our 2nd wealthiest client, I believe, if appearances were to be believed. 

Every fucking time we came by, she knew us by name. She made us fresh-baked cookies and invited us to help ourselves from anything from their drinks refrigerator. (They had a separate fridge just for gatorades, starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar energy drinks, fucking everything.) 

It's hard to explain. It wasn't just that she smiled at us politely. She didn't ""just"" treat us like equal humans (which was rare e-fucking-nough) but when she looked at you she *saw* you. You could really tell that she was just this amazingly sweet woman.  

I was jealous of a lot of our clients, but not her. I was happy to see her wonderful life, because she was just so damn nice and I thought she deserved it.  

I did so much ""extra"" shit for her for free, that I never even told her about. Fixing drains, doing ""deep"" cleaning stuff that we weren't paid for, etc.  

Man, I wish I could remember her name or even where she lived. I only remember how she made me feel. I can't even remember her face."

"People need to be careful who they step on when they're climbing the corporate ladder because those same people are at the bottom waiting when that person climbs back down.

Something similar happened in a department that I retired from. At one point the manager we had that everyone loved dearly moved to another department. His replacement was some old bag no one knew nor ever heard of. I'm not even sure where she came from but she worked for the company. She was an old skinny bitch who had zero experience in management and it showed. The first thing she wanted done was her office repainted. I had to paint it even though I had tons of other projects that were much more important than her stupid office. She chose the colors and even wanted the damned ceiling painted. Fuck me. 

The next thing this bitch did was try to change policies that had been in place since the department had been there which was a long time. She had these wild stupid ideas that made no sense to anyone and basically she was trying to turn the department into something it absolutely could never be. We were very busy and didn't have enough time to do the things we had to do but she wanted us to stop what we were doing and entertain her ridiculous ideas. 

The staff began to complain to the director about this woman. Everyone complained, not just a few. 

At the end of every day it had always been the policy for all of us to stop our projects and clean up. We had to stop twenty minutes before we clocked out to clean. Makes sense because the shop was borderline construction in a theme park and we could make some big messes. Every single day the new manager came out of her office to babysit us and make sure we were cleaning. Most of us were but there was always someone who wasn't so she would jump on their asses about it and rightly so. However, this day she targeted me for some reason and I'm not sure why. Maybe I just happened to be in the wrong spot at the right time. 

She sees me and walks into a room where we stored extra paint. A small and narrow room. All the shelves were full of paints and the five gallon buckets were sitting on the floor under the shelves. They were much too large to fit on the shelf and they had been stored there long before she arrived. She orders me to put those five gallon buckets up on a shelf. I looked at the time and I literally had three minutes before I was to clock out. I first told this witch that the shelves were full plus they were way too narrow for five gallon buckets and I *showed* her. She turned into a fucking monster and demanded that I put those buckets on a shelf. I am not one to take ridiculous orders from a person who knows absolutely nothing about my job and I was fuming. I balled up my fist to knock the shit out of this bitch and I told her *as I passed her* that I was clocking out. She continued bitching at me as I was clocking out, grabbing my things and walking out. 

The next day I went to the director's office and filed a complaint. Not two weeks later the manager was let go. "

What I really like about the game is how your choices have real consequences so you have to carefully plan out your actions. But, while it is one of the best RPGs I've ever played, it's definitely not without its flaws.

For instance, I'd like for the main quests to have their difficulty scaled with your level. I've spent so much time completing contracts, searching for treasure, and completing secondary quests that I'm a considerably higher level than the suggested level for the main quests. It kind of trivializes the whole thing.

"Because on a macro level, it undermines overall social prosperity. 

Societies where parents are responsible for their children until they're independent and then devote themselves to their own sustainability (ie, a parent-down responsibility model) have better overall outcomes because (a) communal sharing is limited to about 25 years, and (b) people generally get to keep the benefit of their own labour and are therefore incentivised to maximise their productiveness. 

By contrast, societies where parents are responsible for their children until they're independent and then are supported have less prosperity overall, because (a) communal sharing is about 50-60 years, (b) people's own personal benefit from their achievements is diluted by being shared more extensively, and (c) people are not incentivised to live sustainably (because they aren't the ones footing the bill. Their participants also have less personal autonomy because the parents being supported have a vested interest in controlling their children's professional, personal, sexual, and procreative choices (because those impact on income availability to support their parents). As a result, you see reduced personal achievement, reduced scope for personal choice of job and partner, and in many such places, behaviours like only working until you've made enough to meet today's needs and then packing up and going home, and the commercial dysfunction that goes along with that.

I don't think communal and child-up models are terrible, but I do think they give less positive overall outcomes in a society, and for that reason are less desirable on a wide scale."

"A citizen's arrest is an arrest made by a person who is not acting as a sworn law-enforcement official. In common law jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval England and the English common law, in which sheriffs encouraged ordinary citizens to help apprehend law breakers.

They had no authority granted by the store, and if the store/company was smart they would fire the guys. I'm not familiar with Canada law, but if it follows common law or if Edmonton has a specific ordinance/code allowing for citizen arrests, then a citizen's arrest is lawful."

"One of my first memories is my mother telling me to either go play with my friends in the neighborhood or stay in my room because the bugman was on his way to spray for bugs.
Of course, six or seven year old me assumes the bugman is some sort of bug-human hybrid monstrosity. I still have the image, fresh in my mind, of what I envisioned the bugman to be.
So I went out to a friends house with my brother. On the way there I asked him if he knew about the bug man and what he told me gave me nightmares for a few years. He said that the bugman was a giant beast with the head of a cockroach, torso of a human, and the legs of a spider. This description, somehow, matched up with what my imagination had already formed and instantly validated my belief in the bugman. My brother then told me that the bugman goes around and sprays everyones homes with poison to ensure that he remains the only bugman, because if he doesn't spray the poison then the bugs around houses will become bugmen themselves. Appearently, if the bugman were to see kids while on the job, he'd freakout and take you back to his web and keep you there for the rest of your life. I believed this for about four years."

The coffee shop open from 9 to midnight so I have to paint the mural after midnight til morning, It took me 5 days with a friend to finish it. And since I work at night I got to know the security guard working at the bank next to the coffee shop, he often watch us working when he was bored with his guarding duty. The last night we were working on the mural he came to watch us again maybe at 2 or 3 am, he grabbed a chair and sit in silent. He seems  a bit distraught by something, I asked if he's ok. He said ""I fell asleep in the basement"", ""so?"" I asked. ""then something woke me up"". ""What thing?"", I asked again. ""a tongue"", he answered, ""something licked my face"". ""what?, a rat?"" I asked. ""I'm pretty sure it wasn't a rat. it got a big tongue, and when I opened my eyes I saw something got up from me and darted to the wall and disappeared"". ""then what happened?"" I asked for the last time. ""I washed my face and came here"", he said. He talked in a neutral and bored tone like all of that was nothing. After his last answer I stop questioning him and changed the subject. After he left doing another round, me and my friend hurried up finishing the work and got out from that building as fast as we can."

"to add: the vast majority of cholesterol does not come from your diet but is in fact synthesized naturally by your cells from acetyl-CoA. 
Diet has a small effect, but even after eating no cholesterol your body adjusts it's rate of cholesterol synthesis to match (because as it turns out, cholesterol is actually pretty damn important).

The best way to reduce blood cholesterol is to reduce intake of saturated fats. The lower the sat fat, the more cholesterol is excreted from your body. (And cholesterol can't be burnt through exercise).

tl;dr saturated:unsaturated fat ratio is a much stronger regulator of blood cholesterol levels than dietary intake of cholesterol itself.

She forgets when got back on one occasion home and walks in with just a towel, having just showered to get ready for work and was looking to dry some scrubs to get dressed. She was a bit lax with coverage to start and moreso when I wished her a good morning and she panicked, realising she wasn't alone.

"**When Traveling Through Southern Africa**

These are just a few of the rules I've learned from the mistakes I've seen travellers make:

* Bring Malarone for Malarial Prophylaxis. It's a godsend. But the other types of prophylaxis (mefloquine, doxycycline) are worse than malaria. Carry some Malaria meds with you and you'll lose half a day at most on the disease.

* Use taxis that are actually advertised as 'taxis'. Some even have sponsorships on them. These are usually reliable. Don't just get into someone's car.

* If you can, though, have your hotel send a car for you or have your hostel call for a taxi so you're getting the correct rates.

* **DON'T JUST TAKE PHOTOS OF RANDOM PEOPLE.** This isn't 'Humans of Harare' or some bullshit. It can be construed as seriously offensive and invasive. This goes double for police officers.

* Carry some American cash on you wherever you go. A lot of Southern Africa's economy is based on the USD or GBP. Over the last three years, I've used four twenty dollar bills across four different situations. You have no idea how much trouble they can get you out of.

* ALWAYS carry your passport on you. Not having proper documentation is an easy way to get arrested/forced into a bribe.

* Most of the rules about water in India applies in most of the countries here as well. Always carry water and make sure that the cap is sealed.

* Carry iodine drops for emergencies (to purify water).

* All the banks are reliable in pulling out money from foreign banks. Some of the country-specific ones only take Visa, but most of the international ones will take Cirrus/Mastercard. Leave the AmEx at home. 

There's probably other stuff, but this is really all I could think of. The other general rules listed here are pretty useful. But traveling through Southern Africa is pretty easy. Just takes patience and a pretty good attitude."

"I'm an undergrad who's been shadowing a Multiple Sclerosis specialist for a bit now, and can confirm. Many of her patients with the progressive subtype of the disease stop being able to exercise because of motor impairments, pain, and other symptoms; they tend to gain weight as a result. 

To every single patient, she tells them to more or less cut out carbs. Protein is great, meat is great, fat is good, vitamins (i.e. vegetables) are essential—but eat as few carbs as possible. A small dessert or a cheat day every once in a while isn't a big deal, but if patients stick to the regimen pretty well they lose a ton of weight even without being able to exercise. 

Also, completely tangential, but people with MS find some INCREDIBLE contingencies to cope and adapt to the changes going on with their body. Like, the amount of time/creativity they spend  finding fixes to such various symptoms is so cool. A lot of the time someone will come in and give the doctor a summary of what they've been trying out to treat their symptoms: what works, what sucks, weird shit that you never would've thought to do (a woman last week had severe, sharp pain in her neck every night, so would put a Bible under her head. The pain would leave quickly and she would go to sleep. I don't necessarily buy the physiological effects directly resultant from having a Bible under your head, but it's just an example of the unique, complex, psychosomatic-DIY fixes that people come up with on their own). 

It's especially helpful to get this kind of info from patients since MS can lesion pretty nearly any part of the nervous system and produce a profoundly diverse set of symptoms for any group of patients. Having these kinds of unconventional treatments in your back pocket is super helpful!"
"Not entirely true, there has been a big push in recent times to change it and recognise the Aboriginals in the constitution. The main issues are 1) a lot of Aboriginal Elders want nothing to do with it. 2) although it kind of allows for laws to be different there aren't any that are, save for ones that recognise the Aboriginals connection to the land and allows them certain land and game rights that white fellas don't have and 3) It takes a referendum for the constitution to be changed and although all politicians agree that it should happen they're afraid that it could lead to a hate campaign against the Aboriginies by far right fuck heads.

"I'm a 5th year law student that has studied quite a lot of EU law, so I'll try my best to provide a simple explanation.

The referendum in itself is advisory and tells the parliament that the simple majority (about 52%) of the people want to leave. It is not a binding decision by any means - although I highly doubt the parliament would have the balls to ignore it. 
As was being said earlier in this chain, the current PM David Cameron stepped down and the next elected PM has to deliver the documentation needed under the Art. 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (if I recall correctly on top of my head) in order to start the process of leaving. There is a 2 year period to get everything done and leave.

The UK hoped that the EU would start negotiations about their future relationship right away, so that they would have more time than the 2 years as described by the Treaty, but the EU refused to do so in order to not give the UK extra time to get a good deal and make the process of leaving difficult and undesirable.

As no country has ever left the EU, it will be super interesting to see what kind of a deal the UK manages to negotiate and how fucked they are going to be. The EU itself will be fine, although time tells if more countries are willing to leave after this.. 
At least here in Finland there is some movement towards getting a referendum of our own, but it will likely be just a radical movement and not get too far."

"I have experience being homeless as a teen. I used to steal bus tokens from machines (they always got stuck) and sold them to convenience stores to get by for the first few weeks. (sometimes I stole from cars) - since you think about it, I'll share what I know - I once knew a guy who did panhandling sometimes, he wrote a sign that said he needed money to get to his daughter in another city. By 12 o clock noon he came back to me with over $100, bought beer for himself, weed for us and cigarettes. Just about every panhandler I met had the same routine. In fact I ran into this guy last year, in the same area doing the same thing. 

What was difficult for me was I had no outstanding job skills (although I had been working since I was 12 until that period) I couldn't see a way to get a job in the city without an address, a phone, clean clothes and a place to shower. That was the only obstacle. Getting a place to shower and a phone, which requires a job and job vice versa requires these things. Eventually I put government assistance money into an ounce of weed, and sold weed until I got an apartment, then met a girl and got a job at a grocery store still selling weed weed.. I quit selling weed and got a job as a labourer for concrete work, then got a job in the union as a plumber got my GED, and opened a fine jeweller store. 

I think the sole problem to homelessness is opportunity for work, and now I am a sole advocate against free trade. People without skills need the ability to walk into factories to get a job and the discretion  to  be late if they have mental health issues or drug addiction or other issues. In a society where employees outnumber the demand for them where punctuality leaves otherwise good employees who need some lee way in the dust. "

"1. Find a credit card with good travel benefits and insurance. Many of these are free, and paid ones can include things like bonus points for signing up and airport lounge access.

2. Book airline tickets around 53 days in advance. Many people have studied prices and 53 days is the best time to buy.

3. Check how public transit is in the city you're visiting. See how much you'll have to spend on cabs/cars. Get the phone numbers of reliable car companies and get the app for any public transit you need.

4. Look up some of the attractions you want to see in the city and see if you can get discount combo/advance purchase tickets. 

5. Use sites like Trivago, Kayak, and Hostelworld to find good deals on hotels/hostels. Decide what you're willing to spend per night beforehand. Try to book dates that aren't commonly traveled.

6. Use credit cards for everything! Fraud is much harder to fight across international borders, so having a CC company on your side will help everything. Find out what cards are common where you're going and bring one.

7. Many visas can take months to process, so get started on that early and make sure your passport is good for at least 6 months after you plan to return home

8. If you're going to multiple cities in Europe, consider getting a Eurail pass. It can save hundreds on train tickets.

9. Discount airlines can fill in the gaps where trains are long/have bad connections. Also if you're flexible with the cities you want to visit, see what deals these airlines have.

10. Look up some basic customs and phrases in the culture you're visiting. Greeting someone in their native language instantly makes them friendlier if you need help with something.

11. Research restaurants beforehand in your price budget. You don't want to rely on finding random food when you're in an unfamiliar place and/or don't speak the native language. Tripadvisor is good for this. Also get the Tripadvisor app for the cities you're going to.

12. Planning is everything. Anywhere you want to go, make sure you know how to get there, where you're going to stay, how much things will cost, where to eat, and any other general advice for travelling in that area."

"My sister in law had a baby 3 months ago then got married to my brother on mothers day. They live with my parents and get all kinds of help.

My brother is the only one of them working and according him and my parents she will refuse to wake up during the night to take care of the baby even on the nights that he will be working the next day. The thing that has bothered me the most is the othwr day she texted my mom the other day asking if my brother and her could start pulling all nighters with their friends. It's as if she hasn't realized that that baby is her responsibility. My brother is doing everything he can to take care of that baby and my parents have been helping them and she refuses to go and get her GED or drivers license. She kinda just puts everyone out. Everyone has spoken to her about all the crap she does but she doesn't seem to get it through her head that these issues need dealt with. It's not like she's on drugs or anything but she needs to step up and be a mom to that baby. All the help she gets would make sense if she had other responsibilities like a job or something."

"My issue with the amount of antibiotics we give to animals is the concern of antibiotic resistant bacteria.  

Just last year we found bacteria that developed resistance to Colistin, the strongest antibiotic developed so far. This resistance can spread easily as bacteria can spread the genes for it via reproduction or by passing it on to a neighbor bacteria in the form of a plasmid.  

This is of concern to me because a lot of time is required to develop better antibiotics and that time is a lot longer than it takes for the resistance gene to spread through populations (bacteria populations double every 20 minutes approximately). 

And just as a world without vaccines will make viral disease problematic, a world in which antibiotics don't work will make bacterial disease problematic.  "

"&gt;Are you saying Conservatives hate black culture just because of it's existence? Like all these white people are disgusted by blues, jazz, soul music, soul food, African heritage/customs, and the black spirit that survived slavery? Or are you saying inner city celebration of poverty, crime, and poor education is culture that needs protection?

Both.  Elvis used to get his records burned in the middle of the street because he was emulating black culture.  Certain rap albums have been straight up banned from being sold.  Black fashion like braids, dreads, sagging pants, zoot suits, literally anything a black person wears is demonized and associated with their lowest common denominator.  

There is definitely an ingrained hostility towards black culture by a certain segment of racists.  This is because they believe (correctly) that once white people start accepting black culture, they'll eventually start accepting black people as well.

And for the record, there's no such thing as an ""inner city celebration of poverty and crime"".  That's not some monolithic belief poor people have. This idea that the only reason people are poor is because they want to be poor is how rich people make excuses for letting people live in such conditions.  Expressing yourself and telling others about your environment and coping with a life sentence of poverty is not the same as celebration.  And hell, even if it is, so the fuck what?  Everyone has to make the best out of their situation.   It's like poor people aren't allowed to be happy and if they are then they aren't really suffering and don't deserve any of our help or empathy.  I hate that train of thought."

Trump's only policies are ""I've got a guy, he's the best, everyone knows he's the best"" for everything. He had no actual plans. 

He wants to build a wall to block mexico... with no plan. 

He wants to ban all muslims until we ""figure out what's going on."" What a stupid, lazy, ignorant comment. We know what's going on. Some people are assholes and some assholes happen to be muslim. The same as white assholes, brown assholes, black assholes, yellow assholes. "

"&gt; people need food to survive

People don't need food fancily prepared at a restaurant to survive.  But they are willing to pay for it.  I assure you not all people making a living as cooks are doing it out of love of the culinary arts.  I'm sure some of them would love to sit around with endless ingredients and creates special creative dishes but instead they are taking lots of orders under pressure and trying to manage a whole kitchen staff to make the food people order.

This is the same way it works for most working musicians.  They might want to sit in a room being creative and writing music that speaks to their souls, but most of the successful ones learn a wide skill set and put it to use provide the kind of music people like and are willing to pay for.

I think the real problem with music is that most aspiring or hobbyist musicians are generally out of touch because they feel like they should be able to make it just playing music they like and don't realize there is another path.  Like any of the other jobs I mentioned and really almost any creative field, you will have to do work that doesn't ""speak to your soul.""

For some reason people view you as a sell out for doing that.  But really I think a lot of hobbyists just don't have the skill set nor the discipline to develop that skill set.  Most ""bands"" fail because their goal is making it big rather than getting good and providing a service.  I see bands that just reinvest constantly in their own success... new equipment... new touring gear... more studio time.  They are playing the lottery hoping to ""make it big"" but you can absolutely make a living not making it big.  Unlike the public perceptions, most people making a living as musicians are people no one has ever heard of.  Extremely rounded local musicians doing a ton of different types of work.  Or studio musicians being badasses who can nail almost any style in one take with amazing sightreading and improv skills.

The idea of ""artistic integrity"" is just a lie that keeps most people from being able to make a career out of something they love because they are too snooty to explore all aspects of that career field."

"When I was in college, my Community Corrections class visited the Maximum Security Unit about 20-30 minutes away from my University's town. We were walking around with the guard, looking at the ~~zoo animals~~ inmates who are actually people. Guard 1 yelled at Guard 2, ""Hey! Dude! Go show them inmate whoever!"" G2 got real giddy and took us over to this man's cell. He knocked on the glass with his baton, got the inmates attention, and then tapped his own forehead with his baton. The inmate removed some bandaging and revealed a crater about the size of a softball in his forehead/top of his head. G2 later told us that this inmate had been asking to go to medical because of severe headaches but for whatever reason, they refused. The only way this man could relieve the pain he was feeling was to bash his head against the concrete walls of his cell until he had cause the irreversible damage we saw. Turns out, the inmate only had an abcsess tooth that he needed to have pulled. The guards weren't too worried about their failure to help this guy out. 

The inmate looked so humiliated when he came to his window and saw a bunch of kids staring back, and this guard wearing his goofy smile. I had a real problem with the way those two individuals were treating these people. In the prison's defense, the rest of the guards did seem to at least care a little for the inmates. We just met these two Slap Dicks first. "

"You are missing the point. In order for women to get to know that ""great guy"" inside, they have to believe you won't murder them on the first date. Dressing like you're used to being part of society and have an understanding of normal social cues, boundaries and emotions goes a long way towards that, particularly when it comes to interacting online (which is very common now).

Let me give you a few more extreme examples to try and make my point: if you dressed like a circus clown every day and acted like it was a totally normal thing, that might seriously hinder your ability to interact with most women in a romantic way. If you decided that you ""just didn't like the feel of antiperspirant"" or ""didn't feel like showering that month"", it would be reasonable to assume that the majority of women (and people, at this point) who liked you liked you in spite of these weird, repulsive tendencies. They are, however, actively hindering your ability to interact with people in a normal way, and I have no idea why you would encourage that behavior.

Sturgeon's recent talks were to essentially ""feel out"" the position of Scotland maintaining the UK's place in the EU in the event of England and Wales leaving.

She's been told, quite correctly, that Scotland would need to become independent and apply to the EU as a new member.

Also, whilst I understand the Spanish acting-prime minister's decision of not supporting Scotland, I feel that doing so due to his own country's internal stability issues is not Scotland's problem to deal with. 

Furthermore, he would do well to remember that Scotland was a sovereign country before England and has always been a country. It's just been in a political union for the last few hundred years.
 
Catalonia, on the other hand has never been a country. It's been a principality of Aragon and currently enjoys being an ""autonomous community"" within Spain, but it's situation is  wholly and completely different than that of Scotland.

Also, Mr. Rajoy's comment that Scotland doesn't have the ""competence"" to negotiate with the EU is extremely insulting.

If anyone doesn't have the ""competence"" to hold discussions at an international diplomatic level then surely it's an offensive wee bawbag like him."

Probably the most republican state in the country. Even if you're running for a local office where party alliance or whatever doesn't matter, if you don't have an R by your name, you don't have much of a chance of winning. It's also why no political candidates ever come here to campaign, why bother, they already know it will be a good or bad waste of time. And you've never seen such hatred for Obama as there is here. Funny thing is, many of those people find it hard to give a legitimate reason why.

Oh, and this state is also still pretty racist. Whether it's Obama or blacks in general, the ""N"" word still gets thrown around a lot. 

Oh yeah, Kansans love their guns.

"I'm the middle of 3 brothers. Less than 2 years between each one. When I was about 10... A few weeks out from Christmas... Bros snooped and found presents mom bought that day. I didn't rat them out. My youngest brother wasn't (still isn't) great with secrets and blabbed at the dinner table. Mom was furious, telling them they were officially on the naughty list. They laughed it off as an empty threat.

How wrong they were.

Fast forward to Christmas morning, time to pass out the goods. One problem... Every present had my name written on it. I will never forget the look on my brother's faces... That of pure horror and illness. Right as my little brother started with the waterworks, my mother revealed her plot. I wasn't in on it (I'm not great with secrets either) but all the presents had markings for their rightful owners. There was never another incident with snooping after that.

If you're wearing an appropriate amount of perfume *you* won't be able to smell it after half an hour because you're used to it. If you can smell yourself (pretty much regardless of what you smell like) then you smell bad/overwhelming and you need to take a shower.

"This was the biggest problem with Enders Game. It was an alright movie as far as movies go - but it was nothing compared to the book. I want to say like 90% of the book took place in Enders heads - it was his thoughts, his analysis of any given situation, his reactions, that made the story.

When you remove all that and only have the voiced bit of the story, youre still left with what we got - a sort of action story about an alien invasion - but thats not what Enders Game was. Enders Game wasnt about Ender vs the aliens - it was supposed to be Ender vs his own thoughts, Ender vs his peers. The alien plot was more of a setting than an actual plot when it really comes down to it, and the movie just totally fails in that. "

"I like to think so, but i would also like to be able to walk around out in the world without that crippling fear. I do actually have a funny story of my older sis and me. We were in high school at the time and my mom worked at the middle school (maybe 9 or so blocks away.) After school, we would walk to the middle school and wait for her to get out of work, and then we'd drive home. My mom was well loved by the students, and she had a lot of noon-duty friends that we knew, on account of the fact that we had also gone to that same middle school. I remember walking about two blocks (walking with traffic) and a van starts to pull up beside us. I was walking a bit behind, so my sis didn't immediately notice and instantly red flags were going off in my head. They stop a bit ahead and i panic thinking ""this is it"" and instinctively turn around, while telling my sister to run. I start to run, and my sis is sort of confused and frozen. The driver gets out, and it's legitimately my mom's friend from work and a person we know. She had seen us, coming back from her lunch break, and was going to give us a ride the rest of the way. (if it makes a difference, she has kids of her own too.) She thinks the whole thing is funny but says i probably did the right thing. We accept the ride and she takes us exactly where she said she would, to the school, and probably told my mom about the whole thing. Scariest moment of my life, though."

"&gt; There are major ramifications no matter what the result was. Remain wouldn't have meant no change because there's be lots of reforms to be pushed for and the nature of reforms would become a hot political issue.

Obviously. But it would have meant having some kind of control and diplomatic discussion over the changes and reforms, rather than having our ass handed to us by an organisation that no longer feels the need to be generous - the opposite, in fact, as it now wants to deter other countries from leaving the EU. 

&gt; And who exactly made you the judge of how ""informed"" the electorate is? There are stupid people on both sides of the debate, and both sides will have had supporters who voted that way for questionable reasons. Or is the electorate only ""informed"" if they agree with you?

All you have to do is look at the main points of the campaigns - in particular the Leave campaign. Full of lies and misdirections. I can link you to a few fact checking sources if you want.  If the majority of people voted according to the information given in these campaigns, then yes, they were misinformed. 

&gt; 52% of the vote is absolutely enough to make changes as big as leaving the EU. That's how democracy works.

A large part of his campaign is based on playing on and exacerbating fears of terrorism from Muslims (especially immigrants and refugees, despite none of the attacks in American attacks have been from refugees). He openly mocked a disabled reporter.  He still believes in the freaking birther movement of all things, and anyone who believes in that is just a goddamn idiot.  After the Orlando shooting, his first comments weren't about sympathy for the victims but were congratulating himself on predicting the attack and blaming Obama for them.

He is a totally decent guy and while he didn't ""get clean"" and he admitted as such, he got his vices down to beer and weed and had it COMPLETELY under control(and still does to this day). His girlfriend was a different story. Did anything she could to pick a fight with him, get high or drunk somehow, and get in a more dramatic fight with him. So I had that shitstorm to deal with for two weeks while they waited for their place to be ready. The place took and extra MONTH to fix up. Their arguments got worse all the time. I couldn't keep any kind of booze in the house because she'd immediately jump on it. Once the house was dry she'd start asking questions about it and when she figured out that I wasn't going to get any, she'd take off. Presumably to go get loaded. She came back one night plastered, broke the key trying to unlock the door, and went to start a fight with him. She fell face first into the corner of the bed(I could see it from where I was sitting) and then came out and told me to call the cops because he had hit her.  I wouldn't do it and pointed out that the mark was on the wrong side of her head since he was left handed. She stormed back out and I told my friend they had to go. I gave them a couple days to get their shit together and they called the new landlord. He said they could move in but he had some work to finish. Bye, guys. She tried to convince him everything was my fault because I wouldn't ""just let her be who she was"" and that's why she was fighting with him and that everything would be fine once they got a place.  She called the cops and had him arrested for domestic violence a month later.  He said it didn't happen, I'm inclined to believe him.  I'm still good friends with the dude to this day and he's still single. It's been like 7 years."

Bernie got so hopelessly behind early in the race with those disastrous SC results, and it was obvious how the race was going to end based on demographics.

"&gt; Everything you're told on the TV? It's bullshit. Everything CNN.com or MSNBC.com tells you? It's bullshit.

I don't get my political info from CNN or MSNBC.  Not because of some inherent bias, but because there are better places to get my info from.  Also, who exactly should we be going to for unbiased and truthful political info, if all TV news is mistruths and lies?

&gt;GE produces all kinds of tech for the military. Clinton is a good investment for them.   

So do many, many other corporations and industrial firms.  Is Clinton good for all of them?  Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc?  Also, how does the fact that GE produces military equipment relate to who they might tacitly back, when they produce huge amounts of non-military products?  

&gt;Essentially the argument you people are making is, ""See all of these compromised, clearly biased sources owned by a handful of individuals who benefit from lying to us? They're more reputable because I've been told to believe they are and been conditioned to believe the images they project are reality.""

No.  The statement that you believe that they are biased does not inherently make them so.  If you look at CNN believing that everything they do is to promote Clinton unethically, then you will see it exactly so.  Likewise, if you try to see things as if CNN is completely unbiased and a model of perfect journalism, then you'll see it that way.  Your furious hatred of popular media will create ways in your mind of justifying that hatred by twisting everything they do to seem corrupt and biased.  If Clinton does a good thing and Sanders does a bad thing and they report exactly what happened, you'll believe it's biased journalism because they're trying to promote Clinton over Sanders.  But if they report that Clinton did a bad thing and Sanders did a good thing, absolute silence on your end, or you'll rejoice how CNN has finally found it's way out of the grip of the Clinton cabal to report on the unbiased and complete truth: Sanders has done everything right his entire life and has held every single progressive viewpoint ever, and is the shining example of humanity, and Clinton is a war criminal, puppet of corporations (Although I thought she was controlling them, not the other way around), puppy killer and jaywalker.

I'll ask you this again.  Who should I go to for unbiased media reporting that simply states the facts as is?  

&gt;Some basic questions that determine how much you understand about politics and government.

Because [voter tests have *never* disenfranchised people, ever.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_test#Voting)

Furiously raging against the omnipresent Clinton cabal by yelling at people on Reddit and nonironically and using Carlin and Orwell quotes to call people uneducated sheeple isn't ""knowing how the world works"".

"I auditioned for the X Factor. 

So the footage you see of the auditions, where everyone is really excited and waving, is all choreographed for the cameras. The fast paced queue walking into the audition venue is also staged, because *the queue itself is staged.* We walked past the cameras, and filed into the stadium and were separated into sections to just sit and wait. We auditioned in front of producers - twice! - before the successful people got given a Golden Ticket (no joke) to proceed to audition at a later date in front of the famous judges you all know and loathe.

The excitement you see from the auditions is also, sadly, all staged. We waited from as early as 6am until 10am outside in the freezing cold before we even got the chance to begin the official queue around the metal gates, and stayed there till noon, also in the cold March wind and rain, until we could go inside. I personally then waited another four hours before I could audition. 

It was a loooooong day, it was fucking brutal, and after I failed my eventual audition I was relieved to go home and crawl into bed. I'd travelled from four hours away and stayed in Glasgow the night before to audition, and maybe I'm not famous, but I've never slept so soundly than the night I got home from that shit show."

Unfortunately, we are in a very competitive market, so there was no way to look at houses we had considered because they were already sold by filming. It was a fun experience, and they really made us stick to what we had said during our interviews- they were more concerned with consistency than drama. "

"**The Drizzle that Rained like Swimming Bears**
 
John Q. Barleycorn looked at the bendy guillotine in his hands and felt sparkly.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always hated creepy Oxford with its villainous, vague volcanoes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel sparkly.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Mama Longstroke. Mama was a cowardly juggler with ample toenails and fluffy spots.

John Q. gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a tactless, energetic, squash drinker with pointy toenails and grubby spots. His friends saw him as a mushy, mammoth muppet. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a frantic chicken.

But not even a tactless person who had once made a cup of tea for a frantic chicken, was prepared for what Mama had in store today.

The drizzle rained like swimming bears, making John Q. fuzzy.

As John Q. stepped outside and Mama came closer, he could see the successful glint in her eye.

""I am here because I want love,"" Mama bellowed, in an intuitive tone. She slammed her fist against John Q.'s chest, with the force of 1094 pigeons. ""I frigging love you, John Q. Barleycorn.""

John Q. looked back, even more fuzzy and still fingering the bendy guillotine. ""Mama, Is that real leather,"" he replied.

They looked at each other with angry feelings, like two giant, gifted guppies bouncing at a very helpful carol service, which had reggae music playing in the background and two controlling uncles chatting to the beat.

Suddenly, Mama lunged forward and tried to punch John Q. in the face. Quickly, John Q. grabbed the bendy guillotine and brought it down on Mama's skull.

Mama's ample toenails trembled and her fluffy spots wobbled. She looked unstable, her body raw like a tall, troubled teapot.

Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Mama Longstroke was dead.

John Q. Barleycorn went back inside and made himself a nice beaker of squash."

"This feels like my father talking. He loved my mother so damn much. They met at age 18 on the first day of University. He proposed to her ten days later. She was already engaged to someone else at the time and broke it off for my father. She then told him that they were going to have a long engagement and that she would leave him if she met someone else that she preferred. They got married at age 24, she had at least one affair early on in the relationship that I found out about at xmas, so who knows how many she really had. My father worshiped her, she loved him too, sure, but she also loved his prestige and earning power. I remember she told me with a laugh that for her 40th my father bought her emerald drop earrings, she threw them back in his face after she opened them because he 'should have known she didn't like green'. This was in response to a discussion as to why he never bought her any jewelry as a surprise, he just sat there with a sad smile on his face. Even when dementia was slowly swallowing his mind he would just sit there and smile at her. She would scowl at him and yell 'What?!"" At him, all he wanted to do was love her. Fricking heart breaking."

"When I was in middle school I was using the bathroom just minding my business...and suddenly I hear a girl run into a stall and slam the door shut. Apparently she couldnt hold it in any longer becuase she peed right on the bathroom floor.

"Actually a month ago, my boyfriend and I had to use the restroom at a rest stop at like 11PM at night. Of course the women's side was locked, and I had to pee really bad, so my boyfriend goes to the men's side and makes sure that no one is there and we go inside. Anyway, the locks are all broken on the stalls so I'm awkwardly trying to hold it closed when a guy comes in and tries to push open my door specifically (it was large and handicapped). He felt really bad when I said it was taken and he realized I was a girl. Anyway, funny part  afterwards he started talking with us when I was washing my hands and he said, ""Yep, I've used a women's restroom before. Sometimes when you gotta go, you gotta go!"" And that's how I made friends with a man in a public restroom at almost midnight."

Sia - Elastic Heart
"I dated a girl in high school back in the early 90's who had a ""stinging"" fetish. We were together throughout most of 11th and 12th grade.

She'd spend hours hunting and catching insects that sting using a sweep net - wasps being her favorite - and store them in jars in her room. She'd use a pair of entomologist's forceps to pick them up and then intentionally sting herself in the nipples, clit, and labia with them. She'd do this multiple times in a single go.

Thing was, she was fucking *allergic* to wasp stings. Her nipples and vagina would swell to several times their normal size. It looked like it would be agonizing to me.

She used to call me any time her parents were out of the house - as soon as she was done stinging - and beg me to fuck her. Being the horny teenager that I was, I obliged every time. I have to admit that I got a bit of a thrill out of making her cry with my dick. (Other women have cried, too - but that's been a result of laughter.)"

I found out he also has a report stating he said ""sometimes I wish I could kill you"" to his three year old, who was too slow to get into the car.

He is potentially a wife beater, wants to kill his kid, has a temper. If all of this is true, then he is the worst person I've ever met."

"America... Sorry, I'm sure most of you are great and I've met plenty of Americans who are but there are certain things that I've observed over the years. Firstly many Americans come to other countries (particularly European countries) without even the smallest grasp of the language and just yell louder and get annoyed when people don't speak English. I'm not saying learn the language but even phrases like please, thank you and hello make it seem like you are at least trying. Leading me to point number 2, why so loud? Not all statements or phone calls need to be yelled. Lastly learn some sensitivity to local customs, coming to northern ireland and asking at every bar for an Irish car bomb is not the hilarious joke you seem to think it is."
"While it is a tricky question to poll, there was a study released just the other day that sought to tackle exactly that. I'm at work so I don't have the graph handy, but I remember roughly what it said.

It asked a bunch of pretty blatant race based questions (opinions on african american intelligence, propensity to engage in crime, etc), and split the results by what candidate they support, Clinton/Sanders/Trump/Cruz/Kasich, as well as comparing it to the overall average rate.

Clinton and Sanders supporters scored the least racist, but were far more than I would have thought. They were only a few percent below the baseline. Kasich, then Cruz, were 1-2% above it.

Trump supporters were an outlier, with a higher percentage of them holding racist views than any other candidate.

Like, I'm sure most Trump supporters aren't racist, but he's using a lot of thinly-veiled dog whistles, and has gotten groups like the KKK or Stormfront very excited."

I started with tiny wooden hoops and kept going and going because I found the whole process super addictive, and I'd keep finding bigger gauges I liked, so I'd constantly stretch to fit them. 

The only thing that sucks is that they only shrunk to about a size 8 when I took them out. I can wear normal earrings as long as they have a big plastic backing for support, otherwise the earring falls out. It's not really big enough to get reconstructive surgery, but a small downside to stretching to a 00. Sometimes I regret it and sometimes I miss it to be honest. "

"Not sure about elsewhere in the world, but in NY the police almost never book an overdose victim unless they think it was a suicide attempt or the dude gets violent with the paramedics(very common because the Naloxone they use to save your life rips all of the opiate molecules off your receptors, sending you into a sort of insta-withdrawal). 

Even seen them let off a girl with a bench warrant cause obviously she already had a shitty enough day. They just gave her a list of support numbers and really tried to talk her into going to a rehab. She didn't clean up right after that, in fact she was sticking a needle into her arm again thr next day. 3 years later though she's a great mother of a beautiful kid and a responsible adult and fitness coach.

Those cops were good people, which is so much more than I can say for so many NY policemen, despite having many family members in that line of work."

See if your company will sponsor training programs for certifications such as the CISSP or GSEC.  Get involved in some organizations like ISACA or (ISC)2.  Do some networking.  You have to do some self promoting.  Be vocal about your career aspirations.  A good boss should help guide you as well as potentially be your advocate if new opportunities become available."

"I was the weird kid at school. I was shy to the point of it being a mental problem and wouldn't talk to anyone outside of my circle of friends. I would spend my lunch break reading in the library or walking around the playground with headphones on my ears listening to music. I would be quite open about my love for Sci Fi and horror, which although not strange now, was certainly strange for a prepubescent girl. I would make up outlandish stories, invent boyfriends etc. i don't know why, i guess i wanted people to like me. I did suffer from emotional abuse as a child via my parents, who neglected me and focused entirely on my sibling, who is younger than me, my mum was the worst for is and she still does it now, even though she Denys it/doesn't realise she's doing it. I had to go to counselling too and at one point was seeing a child psychiatrist. I'm number dyslexic, which wasn't a known thing when I was at school, I have the mathematical capacity of a 6 year old but I excelled at everything else, so would frequently get frustrated in maths and throw books across the room, much to the hilarity of everyone in the room. I found out about my dyscalcula by accident when I was 19, by then far too late to do anything about. I'm 34 now, still weird but now I embrace the strangeness. It helped me to find my Husband (who was also the strange kid at his school!) "

"Apparently the S7 uses AMOLED, so I guess LEDs burn in then, I always thought they just had pixel death.  Guess I don't really use my phone that much to have personally experienced it (yet).

Edit: 

Quote from the wiki on AMOLEDs
&gt;The organic materials used in AMOLED displays are very prone to degradation over a relatively short period of time, resulting in color shifts as one color fades faster than another, image persistence, or burn-in.

So its apparently because it uses the organic LEDs rather than backlit LEDs that it burns in... Maybe with OLEDs gaining popularity, screen-savers will make a comeback, though since OLED is mostly used for phones, and phones normally just shut off the display when not in use... probably not."

Also if they decide to start medication be accomodating. Read the side affects and just ask them if they're ok physically and let them talk about anything on the mental side if they want to.

I don't resent these people and there is nothing whatsoever wrong with their gaming or their experiences - It simply upsets me (As per the title) that people are being introduced into the gaming pool with shallow, emotionless, swipe-your-creditcard games.

This is a result more of the developers and people trying to cash in rather than people's individual preferences. 

Asteroids was a bad example as that was the EARLY, EARLY days of gaming, but it's as this fellow said - I grew up with games that were really trying to push the envelope of gaming - Diablo coming out, Mario 64, Warcraft, Final Fantasies, that kind of thing. 

Now developers are content to push easy, slapstick phone games for a quick buck, and that's what people get as their gaming experience. "

"[here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/magic-story-archive) you have a general archive of a lot of what is available online.

Tarkir story is important in terms of helping us answer some questions about events in the next storylines.

Battle for Zendikar (and Oath of the Gatewatch) is a bit disappointing overall but tells basically a war story. It may help to read some of the Tarkir story.

Shadows over Innistrad continues with one character from Battle for Zendikar and tells a mystery/horror story.

The ""origins"" stories each tell a story about the individual characters from Battle for Zendikar and Oath of the Gatewatch (plus one who appears in Shadows over Innistrad)"

"&gt;It's pretty much impossible for you to scrap HUGE things like save transfers, the entirety of the main plotline 

Where are you getting that bit from? The only contradicting thing I can see is the start scenario (which wasn't changed that much, premise remains the same). The gender of the PC (which can be explained away by the early version she had access too. It is clear from the actual release that a male PC makes more sense story wise. Maybe that was an original idea thrown around at the start)

That and a few characters that didn't return (again 3dog was slated early on, but later dropped). No actual timeline on when she last played the game. The estimate was 40% complete, lots of things can change. 

Nobody thought that it would be in e3 2015 (until the first trailer) or that it would release in 2015 (which it did) when the post was made. The rest can get explained away by playing earlier versions. The stuff that was right was more than just lucky guesses. "

"&gt; Let me give you a few more extreme examples

That's exactly the problem with your argument. You're only considering extremes. You're literally saying that there's only the ""normal"" social acceptable conforming look and everything else makes you look like an outcast. 

No-one is going to disagree with you that dressing like a clown and not showering is going to put people off. That's a given. But there are many more nuances of style, ranging from completely plain over somewhat noticeable to pretty outrageous that are all still acceptable even though they're not seen as attractive by everyone."
"Not really tbh. I think most companies are too lazy to openly source diverse equally qualified potential hires, so they just hire/ promote a minority applicant  to meet quotas. That's not good for the business or the moral of their employees who are passed up on promotions or anything just feel kinda burntout becuase they dont feel like the process was fair.  Like in STEM industries women who are less qualified are way more likely to be hired over a man because they are in such high demand in that field. However diversity is super important so idk. "
"You see, here's where I have to disagree with you on some points - the first, it was simple and charming, great game, great time, great fun.

The second game, it was way too chaotic, you have 10 (11) new creatures trying to kill you, and the puppet takes away too much time from just simply trying to survive.

The Third one. No. Just wayyyy too much green,  and jumpscares are now required to beat the game.

The fourth one is where it picks up a bit, since things actually get pretty damn scary, but it was so hard to listen to the animatronics, that Scott had to release an update patch for the sounds."

"It actually happened a few years ago in Albuquerque. A pimp dropped off one of his ladies at a trailer to do her job. When she was gone over the allotted time, he went to check on her. He looked through the window and saw her laying on the floor. She had been choked to death. The perpetrator was walking out about the same time to remove the body. Both drew their guns, and the pimp killed the killer, a guy named Lorenzo. Turns out the guy was a serial killer. The pimp was not charged for anything but being a felon in possession of a gun. "

"That really isn't flawed logic though.  Pedestrians are massively slower than bikes so they can't come out of nowhere on corners, the motorist can see them well before they turn.  With cyclists the car can be a little ahead of the cyclist, but then the car slows to turn and the cyclist catches up, seemingly coming out of nowhere for the motorist.  While it would be a cyclists responsibility to look before crossing (if it wasn't already illegal to ride on the sidewalk in the first place as it often is), most of the issues with cyclists occur because they think they are exempt from rules of motorists and pedestrians.  

Most places in the US cyclists are legally required to be in the road, not on a sidewalk.  This is because motorists and cyclists are much closer to the same speed than cyclists and pedestrians.  This obviously isn't true on highways and high speed roadways, and it's because the speed gap is very large.  While anything involving a car is going to be more dangerous for a single incident, cyclists riding on sidewalks will make for far more dangerous situations then if they ride on the road and follow motor vehicle laws as they are generally required to."

"The biggest to look at is historical accuracy. That answers the question of did the writers of the Bible know what they are referring to, or is it just authors later making up events and trying to pigeon hole things in. I mean you gotta use the Bible, but I think the idea is not not *only* use the Bible to prove it, but look at things that agree with it.

From there you still have to question things like how accurately could they be from hundreds of years later, or could this take root if they were writing events of the time and adding in things that were clearly false.

I mean there is a lot of history there, but as far as I know - at least from David on - there is very little debate about the historicity of the Bible. Pre-David Bible and traditional timelines become jumbled, but then again, looking so far back, we get less and less things to look at for evidence for our cross reference even outside the Bible."

"Yeah, I guess if it gets to that point it becomes necessary. I haven't gotten to that point. I have had some suicidal thoughts but on the form of suicide obsessions. It is feeling that you will completely lose it at some point and decide to end it all. 

It is really shitty, because you see all that info about suicide, all those stories, you see that you are on the danger zone because of depression/anxiety/whatever is fucking you up and you get anxious that you won't want to live at some point. That makes the anxiety worse, which makes you think about suicide again, wich scares you even more and it goes on like that.

When I finally found out that it is the opposite of wanting to kill yourself (you are scared because you don't want to) it became much more mamageable and I was able to fight it off.

"I don't really consider being okay with it as some unique personality trait, I more associate it with rational thinking. I think the fact that most people's assumption when they hear someone is a stripper (and this is evidenced by the fact that most of the replies I got were people implying my girlfriend is sleeping with people behind my back for money.) is that she must be a prostitute as well in secret is a good indicator of how irrational and colored by a moralistic view of nudity our societies view of stripping is.

I acknowledge most wouldn't want their SO dancing for someone else, but to be honest the fact that people have seen her tits in an anonymous setting doesn't really bother me. 

Don't get me wrong! I'm human just like anyone else I'm not gonna pretend I didn't have concerns at first, but I'm also not a manchild so when someone proves their loyalty to me beyond a shadow of a doubt I don't fold my arms and pout about how they make their money. I get why most men wouldn't be okay with dating a stripper, but I think it's pure childishness that most men aren't okay with OTHER MEN dating a stripper. "

"I'm going to die.  Everyone else is going to die, too.  That means I won't get to experience all that I want to experience, and it also means that all I enjoy experiencing will be ripped away from me.  Nothing will really matter in the end once we're all dead and gone, and everything we once were is annihilated by the nothingness.

However, the only alternative, the one in which you can avoid this predicament, is to not have existed in the first place.  Frankly, I like existing, and I'm always grateful for this brief sojourn into the glorious euphoria of consciousness.  Life isn't always so good, but it's been one hell of a ride and I wouldn't trade it for anything.  Everything matters now, in this moment, and that's pretty much all we have to worry about - not then, now there, but here.

People are always complaining about how life is too short or that time is killing them.  Life isn't too short or too long or just right - it just is, and time always gives before it takes.  Appreciate the offer of life and make the most of every moment, cherish every second.  It's the least you can do. "

It was bright orange and looked like it was on fire.  It started navigating the sky going east and west in a jagged zigzag pattern but was still heading south.  I thought I was just imagining things but multiple neighbors started yelling ""what's that?!"" and ""do you see that?!"" kind of stuff.  After a minute it disappeared into the south side of the sky.

"That's a disheartening experience and when it comes to employment, it doesn't really make sense to make diverse hires if they can't actually perform the job. If a company wants to make a diverse hire and they're sliiiiightly less qualified than a white candidate, I don't know that I'd have a problem with it. But it does seem silly to hire someone who can't do the job. I would say that's more a fault with your employer though, and not with AA as a concept.

But there are a couple points to AA that I don't think you're considering. First, AA isn't just ""we're hiring you because you're black."" The essence of AA is two-fold. The first part is trying to rectify the fact that minorities have faced centuries of discrimination in this country and without affirmatively taking some sort of action to to fix it, it's a self-sustaining reality. Disadvantaged people with no education and low paying jobs, and their children, have incredible difficulty lifting themselves out of that. If you use AA to send a kid to a good college who wouldn't otherwise have a chance to go, you at least have a shot at breaking that cycle. Next, AA doesn't say, ""we're going to give this minority a spot in the college even though this other non-minority is smarter."" It approaches it from the perspective that the minority student has the same exact potential and if the minority student had the same education growing up and had all the same opportunities, he wouldn't need AA in the first place.

Not to mention most minorities face latent, subconscious prejudice on almost a daily basis.

The other part is that AA acknowledges that choosing someone who is less qualified but a minority might still outweigh hiring the more qualified candidate because you're adding someone with a different culture and a distinctly different worldview to the company/campus/whatever. 

And lastly, while it sucks that your own personal goals and livelihood were affected, that's a poor way to judge a policy objectively. If the virtue of a law or policy is how it affects you personally and no one else, you're always going to think negatively of anything that harms you. It's much like the people who thought the ACA was horrible because their premiums went up, but the ACA was a win for society because tens of millions of uninsured people got to have insurance. AA might have harmed you in the shortrun, but it's a net positive for society as a whole. We live in a community, and prosperity isn't a zero sum game. If we correct the drastic inequality that exists in this country, everyone will benefit down the road.

The point is being in favor of people being able to compete equally is the same as supporting AA. Because without it, things are not equal. The legions of minority kids who, say, grow up on the west side of Chicago, in areas dominated by drugs and gang warfare, who have to choose between walking to school through dangerous gang neighborhoods or not going, and who live in extreme poverty, will never be on equal footing as someone like me. I went to a great public high school, I lived in a safe neighborhood, I never wanted for basics like 3 square meals a day, I had both my parents around to help me with homework because they weren't working multiple jobs to make ends meet. I had extra curricular activities available to me. I had no problem getting into a great college and an excellent law school. I had every opportunity I could have wanted. All things that impoverished kids in a Chicago ghetto never get. So if you say, ""just treat everyone equally"" and don't account for life circumstances, you're essentially advocating to maintain the status quo.

"Because I got sent to a school in the next town over that none of my gradeschool friends went to and necessitated I spend two hours on a bus each day, which made socializing after school nearly impossible.

By the time I decided I desperately wanted friends isolation, depression and overmedication had turned my social skills to goo. So I was just a quiet weird kid."

"It's not *that* difficult and you should put time into buying a suit since you won't buy many. 

If you're in the normal range of sizes you can probably find a decent fit off the rack, if you're not (I'm not) then you'll have to search for shops and brands that have your size, and will probably need at least some tailoring. At the very least, make sure the shoulders fit, and shorten the sleeves and pants (which are like the cheapest parts to get tailored.) "

Then you add the cost of running planes and an airport. It's insane. So you have a high cost to run the business,  and a fickle group of customers.

"Apply anyway. 

I feel like a lot of people think you have to 100% match everything listed in a job ad and therefore they don't apply if they don't have that ""1-2 years experience in __ preferred"". I felt that for a *long* time and then at a certain point I just got fucking tired of every ad asking for experience I didn't have and feeling like I couldn't apply to them because I had no chance without that experience and I just started applying to them anyway and *that's* when I got a job.

Not applying = zero chance of getting the job. Applying = at least your name is in the pot. You lose nothing by throwing your name in there but you may potentially lose out if you don't even apply."

"I am so tired of this argument.

There is a difference between being ""Native American"" and being ""native"" American. You were born in America. Fine. You're native American. Nobody is arguing that.

The term ""Native American"" with the capital 'N' is the American PC term for the people who were hear before your ancestors. Yes, they were a different people and we've gotta make a distinction somewhere. I suppose a more appropriate term is aboriginal, since the definition makes the stipulation I just did. But that ain't the term that is used officially now. If you wanna use it, though, go right ahead.

&gt;Even the Native Americans came here across Canada from Russia millennia ago 

Literally a moot point. According to science, human life originated from Africa, so nobody is indigenous to no where. That's a stupid argument because it means nothing. We create social structures to help us understand the world. That's why we name lands and name people from those lands. Europeans are from Europe. Asians are from Asia. Americans are from the Americas. Breaking it down more, Americans are from the country of America and Native Americans (or American Indians, First Nations, Aboriginals, Indigenous Peoples) are the people who were here before the people we now call Americans."

"Start with some seasoned beef mixed with ground bacon and bison. The seasoning should be part paprika, cayenne, basil, thyme, oregano, onion powder and garlic powder.

Then stuff it with something. I've found eggs or cheese to be the best options. Ever cooked an egg yolk inside a burger? DELICIOUS.

Next, I need a nice sharp cheese on top that gives it flavor. Not just cheddar. Something like smoked gouda.

Next, the veggie essentials. Onions. Nice and crisp. Not caramelized. Also pickle slices. Again, thick and crisp to give a nice crunch. That's it, nothing more.

Use the egg white I didn't use inside the burger to top it off, and a little bit of dijon mustard and chipotle ketchup.

The bun should be thick and lightly toasted garlic bread with a little bit of parm/parsley cooked in and a lot of butter on it.

Add a baby pickle on top for garnish, and skewer that bad boy through."

"It doesn't change every year, but does change over time. Proper fit is defined by the current fashion and most certainly changes. What is considered a proper fit today would have been considered wearing clothes that are too small for you 20 years ago. In the mid-80's it was oversized tops with tight pants. In the 70's to early 80's everything was undersized.

You didn't say it had to be as they are now.

I believe that's why they've made more crotch room in men's skinny jeans recently.

Thanks! Makes sense.

"Okay so joking aside... you don't need to color it at all. It's just a hairstyle that resembles the eraser nub on a pencil; one which you are able to grow naturally at that.

Colouring it pink or white would just add punch to the joke. Personally I think white would be best since art erasers are usually white and a hairstyle like that would almost be an art form. 

I also am assuming you are of a darker skin persuasion, and so the white would contrast nicely. I would suggest a nice shock white.

Did you learn English a lot by reading or studying? I feel like it can be very different than learning by listening to others.  Most people just talk like their friends and family talk. I read a lot and occasionally I'll even be surprised by the spelling of a word I've heard spoken forever.

"Jokes aside, wax and shatter are not the same thing.  It's a similar process with a different end result.  Wax is crumbly or waxy, like earwax, hence ""wax"".  Shatter is clear and shatters like glass, hence ""shatter"".  Either one can be called dabs since that just refers to the most common method of ingestion, dabbing it onto a hot nail rig.  Are they both butane-extracted oils that basically do the exact same thing in the body, and is it really nitpicky to actually care about the difference?  Yes.  But saying they are the same thing is like saying muffins and cake are the same thing because they're both made of batter that gets cooked in an oven.  [Here's an article about it by a guy who literally smokes weed for a living.](http://www.hightimes.com/read/shatter-vs-wax-whats-difference)"
"My husband was the same way. He is a super skinny guy (even more so back in those days) and I think maybe he thought the baggy clothes would make that less noticeable? To be fair, I was friends with him back in those days and I thought nothing of it. It's only looking back at photos that we're both like, ""Holy crap, those clothes don't even come CLOSE to fitting."" I guess he thought it was cool at the time. He is a little mad at his teenage self because his parents bought him an incredibly nice leather jacket back then that we found in storage. It's a really timeless style and he would totally wear it now, but despite him putting on a bit of weight since those days, it's still at least three sizes too big. These days, he's adamant that everything fits perfectly and will not wear anything if it's even slightly loose.

That said, I could cringe to death every time I look back at my high school fashion choices, so I can't cast any stones."

"I work at big4, I got my bachelor's degree from top UK uni, so I had a pretty good resume compared to other applicants where I work at (CIS country). I found it by the recommendation of my friend who works at similar field. I earn very little if you compare to US equivalents, but okay compared to other nationals of my age. I don't make extra from additional hours - the position is highly competitive and you are always free to leave. If you are in for money, I would not recommend consulting, there are better ways to earn money. I travel a lot, but don't usually leave CIS borders. If you decide to start, 90% of your experience will depend on the team you get in. The thing I like about consulting is that you don't sit at the same place for too long, every 1-3 months is like a new job."

So, I was actually in year 9 as well when this happened, of course still going through puberty at this time, anyway, I was in maths, the lesson had just started, and out of nowhere I get a b****, and me not realising that my fly was open the WHOLE day, which was even worse as I was wearing boxers, so my d*** of course pokes through my boxers yet I still don't realise this until some girl in my class whispers to me that it's open and she can see it, I went so red in the face and honestly didn't know where to put it, I was never the same since that day.
