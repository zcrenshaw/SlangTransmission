"I'd ask everyone this question 

Which weighs more a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?

Anyone who fails that is gone. See where we are at, then move on from there. 

Edit: Thank you Reddit for introducing me to Limmy. I might have to keep him cuz we're most def gonna need some laughs after almost everyone is dead."
"I had a ""nice guy"" phase my freshman year of college. 

I had friends but none nearby and despite being at a huge university, it was hard to find a place to fit in -- that's what I told myself. 

In reality, I wasn't going anywhere people wanted to be, def not girls -- and I wasn't doing anything interesting. But I wasn't a rapist meathead asshole! Why couldn't I get into a girls pants!

That year, I ran into a girl that I'd met a while back and we hit it off as friends. The problem was, I put pressure on myself to get laid -- it was college -- I should get laid. She was cool and that should have been enough. I was attracted to her though and I felt like if I was doing things for her, I should get sex. Put in kindness coins until sex falls out.

Looking back -- holy shit -- i was an asshole. Everything I did with her was to get laid. Every time we hung out I expected her to want sex. 

We talked every night for a couple of months and were really close friends. We had a good thing going -- it just wasn't physical. One day, while talking, she tells me in passing that she was having sex with another guy (older, alcoholic, deadbeat -- not joking, he actually was a shithead...but that's beside the point) -- but I lost it, yelled a lot, told her she was stupid and that she was just using me for emotional support so she could fuck this guy without getting attached...I felt betrayed -- and it was all in my head. 

The thing is, and what was lost on me at the time, was that  her life wasn't my business. She was a person who had all kinds of thoughts and feelings that didn't have to do with me. She wasn't a princess that I needed to protect or save. She was just a person who happened to be born with an innie instead of an outie. Her life wasn't my business but I made my life her business, and she stuck with me as a friend up to a point, but it must have been incredibly draining. 

2016 me looks back at that and thinks 2000 me was a petty asshole with nothing particularly interesting to say or do apart from talking about how I deserved a girl because I wasn't a criminal and because I ""cared."" Really, I was a sad sack of self-righteous shit, and lost a cool friend because I couldn't get past the fact that my friend was the owner/operator of a vagina.

Holy shit -- I was a self centered, arrogant turd. Eventually, i got over myself. I started working out and I joined a intramural softball team. I met some people that liked things I liked, vidyer games and tabletops -- I made friends. Good ones -- that I have to this day.

As far as women go -- it's hard to say when it happened, but it like a switch was flipped. Women became (gasp!) people -- with depth. I used to have this weird idea that women were special beings that were fragile and blah blah chivalry. It's bullshit -- people are people with flaws and virtues. We all shit and we all occasionally do embarrassing stuff in the mirror. I stopped reducing women to a psychological problem I had to solve and just started talking and listening to cool people.

Eventually, I found out that one of those cool people I talked to also liked building furniture and drinking beer. We started talking more and I found out this cool person also liked movies, traveling, soup, Legos, games, football, nice cars, breakfast tacos, and triathlons. This cool person also owned and operated a vagina -- which I thought was pretty neat -- and she kinda geeked out over how weird a guy's dangly bits actually are.

We were married about a year ago.

Edit: thanks all -- means a lot. 

Edit 2: I am literally the last person who should give anyone advice, but since it might help someone...

1) Leave your house - often - and be like Ariel -- go where the people are -- be part of their world.

2) The internet can be an echo chamber -- step away from that mutual appreciation society.

3) Get some hobbies that involve other people (bonus points if the hobby and people are outside your comfort zone -- try something new)

4) You're not better/worse than anyone -- GROK THIS -- and quit obsessing over your place in the world you entitled shit.

H) There is no secret technique or weird trick. That's someone selling you something. Although --  up up down down left right left right b a start works sometimes -- ymmv.
