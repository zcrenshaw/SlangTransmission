"The film that The Others was based on, The Innocents (1961) is also excellent, loads of chilling scenes that just unnerve and really get under your skin. Zero jump scares, no blood and guts, just great storytelling. Think I watched the whole movie on YouTube, def worth checking out."
"Playing gunbound and the game froze. For those who dont play, once the game freezes, the winner/winning team basically becomes the person who decides to leave last. So it's a 4v4 and players are chatting back and forth talking shit, bribing other team to leave, etc,etc. Eventually it boils down to me and another player on the opposing team.

I get bored and type ""Man I wouldn't mind some Korean food"".
The other player replied how they loved Korean food and we got to chatting. Turns out she's the friend of my friend's younger sister.
We met in person and eventually started going out :)

TL:DR Met my ex-gf by playing video games.


Oh another game experience:

I use to play TF2 on a clan server. Most of them were chill people. This one kid, lets call him assfacemcgee msg'd me on steam chat asking me to accept an invite from his friend so we could play together. ""Sure no problem"". I added the kid and immediately regretted it. His first message that pops up is asking me to give him items. Kind of a dick move imo but sure why not, I got a few common items I was gonna scrap anyway. I give him the items and try to continue with my game.

Not even 5 mins later he begins to harass me for my unusuals(unique/rare items) and I politely tell him they are not for trade. This reply only causes more harassment from him and assfacemcgee, both of them giving me some bs sob story about how his dog died and that I should give him my rare items to cheer him up.

Game on fuckface. So I invited them to TS and figured if they're going to waste my time, might as well waste theirs. So I ask him about how his dog died and assfacemcgee says ""Hold on"". So I told him that these things were a very stressful issue and to take his time. Told him that I would go grab a drink and brb. I didnt. I went to taco bell and took my sweet ass time. 40 minutes later I get back to my PC and they are still on TS just waiting for me. So I asked again how his dog died and this motherfucker took the plot from Airbud and altered the ending. 

Just to make sure, I had him repeat the story. It was def. Airbud. I started laughing my ass off into the mic to replies of ""Bro thats fucked up"" and ""My dog died man"". Eventually they got tired of my laughing and logged off TS, leaving me with a few written messages about getting me banned etc,etc, if I didnt give him my items. I go back to the clan server and play the airbud story. 

He's forever known as the airbud kid. No need to ban the twerp, he eventually moved onto a diff. server. I guess he got tired of people asking him "" So how did your dog die again?"""
