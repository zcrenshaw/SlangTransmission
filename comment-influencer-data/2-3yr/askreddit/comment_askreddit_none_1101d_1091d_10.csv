No but stupid or fat people won't realize that it'd be easier to just get out of their car and walk inside.
"i am Kenyan, and i find it laughable that you have a law or culture that allows homosexuality but condemns polygamy "

Weird. Cause in the US I almost never have anything less than quality service. Its almost as if letting the customer determine how much the sever makes incentivizes them to provide better service. 
"This fucking joke.

I will never understand the longevity a joke that A.) wasn't funny to begin with, B.) has been *undeniably flogged to death* and C.) packs the added bonus of announcing to the world, ""Hey, everybody! I'm a frat-douche asswipe!"""
You probably don't understand evolution/natural selection. If you paid attention in your basic biology class you'd probably realize it's logical. BOOM. Roasted.
"Seriously accents,mannerisms do not make a culture. Those are just minor divisions. Language, tribal groups,religion these are usually the ones which demarcate cultural differences in the old world"
"You have no evidence that it isn't, and I have seen it in restaurants all over the country.

Nice job reading a couple sentences from Wikipedia."

The driving of manual cars is pretty useless
"That the three strikes laws are open warfare on minorities in America.

Health insurance is taxation without representation.

Wage inequality is modern slavery.

Corporte Oligarchy is to modern politics what Fuedalism was to the Dark Ages."
"&gt;I really should watch that show.

If you can get past Steven's super-obnoxious voice, sure.

I've never watched it, but my roommate does... \*eye twitch*"
"Except everything I said *was* in fact 100% accurate and you're just a mindless SJW who believes all of the absolute bullshit being fed to you by corrupt SJW games ""journalists""."
most gays are narcisisstic
"To be fair, she had earlier made him get rid of just about everything in his apartment based on the same principle. Also, he only reclaimed his shit when he thought she wasn't going to get rid of the dogs. Ted is actually one of the nicest guys on the show, actually. "
"that shit was never good. If you wanna see gluttony, go check out Furious Pete. Fuck epicmeal time, once you see that real shit, you'll never go back to that child's play."
"Armored skeptic has always been trash thoigh imo. He's in such an echo chamber himself. His early videos didn't make this clear bc it was always religious shot, but once he goes into politics it's just horrendous "
or the first time.
"Lol that's so untrue I've been in a sweet spot most of my life other than a few years in college when I actually had to work and stuff.  I p much have unlimited free time, a legit perf bf (he's 6' 3"" and a fuggen hawt bod), unlimited money cus my bf is a lawyer.  My life is fricken glorious.  I guess I do want a baby but that can wait :)"
"guns !! who want to carry an assault rifle man for defense !! its scary and and funny too.
yes I understand second amendment but it can cause harm to people."
We're not participating in animal cruelty by buying meat from companies who are cruel to animals
"&gt; the pregnant man

This person is biologically a woman, so its disingenuous to call this person a ""pregnant man."" She was born female, and got pregnant."
"I mean there are literally hundreds of companies in most cities that pay the same as McD's and are similarly unskilled, so they must have had some reason for picking McD's.

If they spend 5 minutes thinking about why they're applying to McDonald's and not UPS, or WalMart, or Chili's then they should have some answers to the question."
Then they should be leading the fight against ISIS. 
"&gt; It's really unfortunate that the basic premise is so god-damned backward

The basic premise is that Communism sucks. Ayn Rand was a refugee from the USSR. You know Communism killed more humans than Hitler, right? "
"Couldn't be bothered, was too bloody lazy. But as you understood the message my efforts (as minimal as they may have been) were not in vain. "
"She really fucked everything with legs, didn't she? "
"What do you call a deer with no eyes no legs that's on fire?
Still no flaming idea"
Wasnt funny. Jokes are funny. Ive faced alot of racism for being half white. Anyway have a great day :)
"I mean he was the most wanted man in the world for a decade, and a wanted man for quite a while before that. Aren't you uncomfortable with the fact that the, supposedly, most trustworthy source in the world, the President of the US, claims that this man was killed but was unwilling to provide any proof that he was dead? We had no problem showing people the graphic footage that proved Saddam and his brothers were dead; same with Gaddafi. I don't claim to know what really happened, but it would nice to have some proof. "
"So should people just call you to make sure they're on the approved list of personality traits, or are you going to post it online somewhere? Also, what's it like being the arbiter of morality for the entire human race? It sounds like a lot of responsibility. "
"I'm sure when you learned to shoot, you were perfect from the get-go."
Thank you for what? The Iraq war? Thanks so much guys.

When they turn traitor to their gender and become feminists.
“I have to dress Kim everyday so she doesn’t embarrass me.”
"Sadly, /r/JailBait used to be real before it got banned."
I um... What? Who is clover? I have no idea what you are talking about at all. Sorry. :/ is this a reference? Maybe i need to step up my furry game because idk what this is. Lol care to elaborate a bit?
This is truly awful.  Did they mention the price structure?
"Here, maybe [this article](http://www.superkidsnutrition.com/nw_whatisacalorie/) from superkidsnutrition.com will help you out, buddy. Good luck at the science fair though! Hope you get that blue ribbon! 

^Aw, ^they're ^so ^innocent ^at ^that ^age, ^aren't ^they?..."
"Yeah, uni profs are literally useless if you manage to get one that has a grudge against you. I'm not the most likable person, professionally, tend to rub people the wrong way, so this has happened to me on occasion."

"Well, that explains how you hit the wall doing 15-20 mph. How the hell did you manage 40 mph? I honestly didn't think it was possible to go 40 mph in reverse...in fact, I might be tempted to call bullshit...

"gyms. Let me just go to this place and waste energy for a few hours doing activities that make me gain nothing except for a slightly healthier body, which can also be achieved with more productive activities. 

#Not to hate on gymrats. This is just an example of how humans are really weird from a biological point of view. 

edit: C'mon people, the point of this comment was not to say gyms are stupid. If you like to work out, good for you I have no problem with that. But the whole concept of having so many excess energy to waste that you need to burn it off with activities that are not for your daily survival are weird, because it's so different from animals in the wild.
