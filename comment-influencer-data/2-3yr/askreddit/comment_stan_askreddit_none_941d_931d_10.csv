"&gt; He pours another Scotch.  

The phone rings. He thinks ""No way. It would be so weird if it was her."" He picks the phone up, hesitates just a few seconds, and says ""Hello?"" A nervous voice on the other end says ""Is this Stan?""  

""Yes, this is he. Can I help you?"" Now he's really nervous because that voice...that voice is so familiar yet he had only heard it once before when that young woman said ""OK, thanks for telling me.""  

""Did you used to work for the city? Like the sewer department or whatever it's called?""  

""Yes I did, about 15 years ago. Why do you ask?"" But he knew why she was asking. He *knew*! His heart was pounding in his chest at this point like it was that day 15 years ago.  

""I think you left a phone number for my twin sister, but she was too nervous to call you and never told me about it. I think she was afraid I'd call you, and I would have! She said you were cute and nice. That was long ago. On her deathbed she handed me this note, and I'm just calling you now to let you know she's dead, and honestly I'm very sorry because it won't be long now before the police show up and I have to go. Anyway, nice talking to you."""
