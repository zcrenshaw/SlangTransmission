"Not my or my partners request, BUT

I was living in the mission in SF and had just got home from work and at the time I rode a bicycle from/to work. I get home, take my shoes off, take my shirt off, and decide to chill out n do some redditing while I cool off. This is when I hear a girl screaming at the top of her lungs, ""Nooo, stop, noo, leave me alone!"" I run to my second story window and can see a bunch of people restraining and shoving a girl into a ferreal RAPE van. So, I panic and run back and forth looking for my phone, not being able to find it, I can hear the van doors close and the van speeds off, so I say 'fuck it', grab my motorcycle helmet and run down stairs (yes, still shirtless and still shoeless), jump on my rice rocket and take off. I'm unsure of which way to go, but I noticed a lil old guy on the corner who also saw the whole thing, and he immediately points me in the direction and tells me which street they're going down. I'm driving fucking full speed, def ran some red lights, but its cool man, I'm about to be a fuckin hero right now. I finally see the van, and they're at a red light. I pull up behind them and I can actually see into the van, through the tinted windows, just barely making out their silhouettes, oh shit, they're taking clothes off, fuck. That's when I notice some girls in the car next to me giggling because i look like an moron riding a motorcycle without a shirt and shoes at dusk in san francisco, but I pull up my  visor and yell to them, that a girl's been abducted and being raped in that van right now and they're faces instant switch and they look and also see all the people and movement in the van. So, now there's a fuckin convoy with this rape van, half naked rice rocket guy, and rando girls. the girls managed to call the cops and when the van gets pulled over I don't stop, but go around the corner to watch from a distance. The rando girls also dip. Then, I watch the cops pull out something like 6 people and handcuff all of them. That's when i started thinking something was weird about all of it. They all looked young, all of them, like they're all the same age, they're not all dudes, there were i think two girls, maybe 3, i can't remember, just really not the type of group that i thought would be abducting young girls. At this point, I don't even know who was being raped because they're all handcuffed. Then they're uncuffed, they all get in the van, and they all drive away. Now it's night time, i'm fucking freezing, and confused as fuck. I run over to the cops and ask them what happened and why they were let go. The cop looks me up and down, then asks, ""did you make the call?"" to which i reply, ""WHAT? No, I fucking chased them across the city on my motorcycle!"" Dude starts cracking up, elbows his buddy in the passenger seat and they're having big ol' laugh, and he says, ""apparently these fuckin college kids were just helping their friend fulfill some crazy sexual fantasy of being raped. fuckin crazy college kids, eh? Look guy, you did a good thing, but lets just hope she got hers before we showed up.""

tl;dr: I cockblocked some chick that I thought was being raped."
