Def not the mayans
"I work as a receptionist/office assistant at a large clinic, so I'm obviously not a doctor but I do deal with a lot of patients. I haven't been doing it for very long but I have a couple interactions that come to mind. One was a lady wanting to know if our clinic would do a ""virginity test"" on her because her PCP told her they don't do that. It took me way too long to explain it's not a real thing. Another lady needed to get tested for STDs, not weird, but she said she needed us to send the results to her prospective employer? Uh why?? We told her we wouldn't do that but she could come get a copy of her results and do whatever she wanted with it. She does but comes back later the same day and says we gave her the wrong test results. We double check, nope, those are def her test results. Trying to sort this out with her, I asked her why her employers would want an STD test anyway. She said it's to make sure she doesn't have ""tubulars"" Then it dawned on me. She meant Tuberculosis. She needed a TB test, not an STD test. She gets angry and yells that we're just trying to trick her into taking more tests so we can charge her more. Then she stormed out... "
