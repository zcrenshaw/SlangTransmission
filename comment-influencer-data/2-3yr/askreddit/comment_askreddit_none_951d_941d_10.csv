Do it yourself
He probably could have seen him at the funeral too 
It's practically rape and incest
"those younger women most likely throw themselves at him though, so its weird that you judge him but not the girl. you are buying into the very hypocrisy that you claimed to object to by calling him creepy, for dating women who consentually agreed to date him.

women throw themselves at rich celebrities, even if ugly, or much older, this happens, these women are doing it on purpose, why judge Leo as creepy  if he isn't manipulating or hurting anyone?"
"My ex said she thought it was hot so I figured I'd give it a try. Turns out she doesn't watch porn, so two kinds of bread fucking is as good as"
"Best 15 minutes for you, worst 15 minutes for the poor little piggy/cow :'("

"Yeah, if I'm going faster than the flow of traffic, I'm fine with being in the passing lane. I'm not going to leave it because someone decides my passing speed is not fast enough for them."
"That was not the question. The question was in history. This though did not allow your agenda.    

Narrow to the US, Still no. Can not fit agenda.   

Narrow to, ""Modern US History"". Well. Now we are talking. I can set modern to whatever I want and now I can spew agenda.    

Abandoning the space program in the 70s and replacing progress with the shuttle program.     

Abandoning Welfare to Work.     

The ADA.    

How many US citizens are going to die because the FDA has decided that even juices containing zero nicotine for vaping are tobacco products?       

Allowing Britain to draw the borders the did in the Middle East after WWII?     

Losing the Korean War?    

Minimal thought is all that is needed to show that it will not crack the top 5.

Speaking like a man is something Obummer didn't do."
"I worked at the disconnect department in a call center. I had a woman call to cancel because her husband died the month prior and couldn't afford the bill anymore. I started ""crying"" and told her that I lost my husband (I've never married) on Christmas day the year before and I know what she's going through. Long story short... She didn't cancel her service and I moved on to the next call like nothing happened."
"No matter how rude or offensive your post sounds, it's 100% true. "
People buy their wedding dress? Most people I know just rent them..
