clearly those people are wrong for being out of energy in the first place.

"Actually, the real answer is that there is no way to know for sure. Some people have reduced sensitivity, some have enhanced, and some probably have little difference. Every dick is different.

"&gt;That every rape accusation that doesn't end in prosecution is a false accusation

Or the exact opposite, that every rape accusation is true until proven false which leads to stats like ""98% of rapists never see a day in jail"" because obviously, if there were no charges because of lack of evidence or smthg similar, the guy is still a rapist."
Fucking cunt.
"The start of Brexit, just to watch more of the suffering in /r/unitedkingdom

Honestly, my favourite part of Brexit and Trump happening is the complete disbelief of the young left, it's great. I love watching outrage culture in action.

That's why the presidential election was a win win for me. I either get to watch the left act outraged or the right, both are extremely enjoyable."

They're mainly being bribed or threatened.

I can agree with this but masturbation is absolutely not a healthy habit

If it's not by choice it's not active but rather passive ;)

Convinced? I'm going to go ahead and say it was money. Girl was a nurse and knew she had to lock down something if she wanted to live the good life.

Yeah he wasn't so great. Fuck that shit. One of my ancestors was a Native American and her parents were killed on the Trail of Tears. She was then adopted by a white family.

"CNN kept telling everyone that some drunk old lady was going to be president, lied about the polls and lied about an individual that wants us to have a better life.  CNN lied about the crowds, wouldn't show the old lady hocking up lungers and wouldn't shed any light on the old hags criminal background.  To top it off, everything they came out of the vodka saturated old lady was a lie and couldn't tell the truth about a mother fucking thing!  Things got so bad that people turned CNN off and now they have fewer viewers than the Garden Channel.  So whenever CNN reports on anything, they are lying."
She dodged a nuclear warhead. ^^^^^^^Meta
Downvoted.
She's a chick with a dick bro.
That sounds more like hypothermia.
"A variety of new hot young girls is always the best. Just because a man fucks other girls doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

"What's it like not having nuts ? Seriously, once you've been kicked square in the nuts, you'll never understand how painful it can be. I've also cracked a tooth open and experienced that pain as well (and yeah, it's very painful) You're sister must have kicked you in the gooch rather than the nuts if you think a toothache is worse."
