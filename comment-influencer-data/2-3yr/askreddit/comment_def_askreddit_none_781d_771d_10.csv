"Bring somone else's mom to a highschool prom.

There is a group of friends. One of them Jake is quite funny, nice kid. His parents go through a bitter divorce. Rumors start coming that one of Jake's best friends Chris is actually banging Jake's mom.  No one could confirm, until Chris pulls the power move of bringing Jake's mom as his date. She shows up blackout. Grinding on all the kids. Getting more drunk. Gets them thrown out.

Names change for anonymity. Felt crazy bad for Jake. He was a junior. Had to live with that for a year. The funny thing is Jake and his mom's relationship has healed, saw them on FB together. I'm not sure I could ever forgive my Mom, def not Chris

"Yea, I agree. As I piss my erection def goes away. It's a great way to get rid of morning wood tbh."
"U need to call 911 too. Even then u might still get a fail to stop citation.
Def call 911 ... they might be able to verify if its a real cop. And if not get help headed that way quick."
