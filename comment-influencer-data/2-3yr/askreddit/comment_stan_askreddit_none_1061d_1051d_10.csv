"""Hello Stanley, Hidden in this room there are 6 tennis balls. Find the ball, Stanley. ""

The room is bare except a couch on one wall. The linoleum is cool and slick. He slides around at first, but he makes a successful jump on the couch and noses through the pillows. No balls. 

""Find it the ball, Stanley.""

Stan jumps off the couch and slowly lowers his body to peak under the couch. It is just tall enough for him to fit his head under, but too low to crawl under. 
With a throaty growl, Stan spots all 6 balls... Just out of nose reach. "
