And humor is subjective. Your point?

"TBH the rape argument for legalizing abortion doesn't make sense.

Either:

1. The fetus has a right to life. Killing it is murder, unless done to save the mother's life. Who does the killing, and whether they are a rape victim, is of no consequence.

2. The fetus does *not* have a right to life. Killing it is fine and part of the mother's choice. If someone kills it without the mother's permission then it's assault/battery against the mother (as opposed to homicide/murder). As above, whether people are rape victims is of no consequence.

The only way the rape argument makes sense is if you think women should be punished for having sex by being forced to carry the child (whereas rape victims didn't choose to have sex and so shouldn't be punished). But of course this line of reasoning has other problems (ie there's nothing wrong with having sex).

Edit: Lmao. Downvoted for legitimate discussion of a complex moral issue."
"Oh man, you guys are like pun gods! That's definitely not an old, beat to death, then unburied just to be stomped a thousand more times pun!

Edit: people really don't like getting called out on beating a dead horse. Hope y'all don't act like this in real life."
I prefer to be in a sound state of mind.

They already do matter equally. Why don't people understand that?

Underrated comment of the day. Congrats.
Or normal people hanging with exceptionally cool 14/15 year olds.
"That was hell to read.

Where does 'the us' come into this? And of course they can't live on their own without parental permission? What does that change? 

&gt;It is not all common that a 17 yr old would live on their own.

It's pretty damn common.

"she was talking once about how anal sex was wrong and it's for poop. then comes the ""but gays are different"". i thought wtf! anal sex is quite alright if done right."
"I downvoted you because you had the words ""I know this might get downvoted but"" in your post."
So just ignore my point?  Cool.
"Brain surgeons would generally know more about everything medical than either you or I. Even though he may not specialize in that certain area, he definitely knows a considerable amount on the topic."
"I'll take uninformed, inexperienced, obviously, but naivety is a lack of wisdom that has a further connotation than just ""I don't know this *yet*"". I obviously don't know this yet, that's entirely the purpose of my (apparently unwanted) contribution to this thread.   
I'm not a child, I'm not some rich kid who doesn't know hardship as they tried to make out in another comment, I'm 35, I've worked since I was 15 so that I could eat and live indoors, and you know what? I've never been to prison.  
Who lacks judgement and wisdom now, eh? The fucking twat who gets himself banged up committing crimes, or the man who does life properly and survives without the fear of being bummed in the shower?   
I'm not na√Øve, I know that criminally minded people are criminally minded, ....  
Ah fuck it, I'm tired of this, fuck all of you.
"
"I bet it would be a different case if it was a child of yours that had been molestered by one of these sick fucks. I know that I would feel prison isn't enough if it was one of my babies that had been harmed by these monsters. I would want them to suffer huge amounts of PAIN!!!!

What about tiny tiny innocent babies that get raped etc by these monsters. A couple of years in prison isn't going to undo all of the damage that has been caused to the babies tiny bodies . And that is just babies. "
"Is a town in New South Wales and is not a fucking replacement for ""yes."" Grow the fuck up."
"How can it be racist?

Muslim is what followers of islam are called. It's not a race, just a group of people.

I could be the whitest kid on the block, and be a muslim."
"eh he could be instagram famous/rapper so it's actually a career investment.   
people can get that stuff lasered off nowadays"
The truth doesn't lie.
"I stated that in reference to the other guy. You really should see the guy first and see what he does. I honestly hoped she found someone great and I never wished her unhappiness or anything which I also said in my post. Instead she found a dirt bag I'm just saying. I know I'm better than that guy thats all there is too it. From everything my friends have told me about him he's not a good guy, how he treats her and everything else. 

When you see how other guys treat girls on top of how they look you get a pretty good idea of where you stack up  so yes I can confidently say I'm 10 times better than that guy and he's literally half the man I am. "
"For now, it's all bullshit. I can't believe some people still believe that shit."
no he doesn't

Thank you. Saved me some time and disappointment.  
  
**edit** - lol, I like how you're getting downvoted for having a dissenting opinion. This is why reddit is a circle-jerk. Only the self-congratulating circle-jerkery gets voted up, so we sit in an echo chamber where nothing really gets discussed.  
  
**edit 2** - Okay, I've just now listened to the most recent episode on bigfoot hunters. I'm sorry to say that it was not nearly as entertaining *for me* as it may have been for those downvoting. I hate to break it to you, but other people have different types of humor that they like and that this is not one of them *for me*. FEAR NOT. Your world is not crumbling down around you. You can still enjoy the things you enjoy and I can do the same.   
  
**edit 3** - turning off inbox notifications for this thread. You guys are repeating the same garbage over and over."
Because go fuck yourself you asshole. Paying a prostitute is not a fucking solution and only a fucking moron would believe it is.
"tbh honest I don't care to pay the entire date, but I meet a feminazi hairy armpit girl who let me pay the entire date with no interference or ask.

I don't understand how she talks about how she is feminist all the time and doesn't care about what she should do for equality"
Noot Noot
Inciting violence or spewing hate speech is just saying something as well. 
"So you believe the ends justify the means?

I've legit met La-ya. She actually called me stupid for pronouncing it wrong.
Is she concerned about police violence or just freaked out that she has a black son. 
"To be fair, the only reason that you are able to pay so little for your prescriptions is because Americans pay so goddamn much.  It's built into the business model of every pharmaceutical and medical device company and it funds the R+D for every drug and device you enjoy. As a Scot, you should really be pushing for Americans to keep our fucked up system the way it is, because if we change it, one of two things happens.  Either a) your prices go up or b) the new drug/device pipeline grinds to a halt."
Not really though. We elected a SJW who gives away all our money. 
"If a man thinks a girl is desirable, she should be obligated to do at least something about it. Not reciprocating a man's feeling is borderline emotional abuse"
"No, because ""gift"" and ""giraffe"" are pronounced differently! "
"Religious and non religious. That way there's a fifty percent chance that humanity progresses. If not, I won't care."
Haha carry on then. Cheers!
