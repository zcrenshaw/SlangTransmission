"Each to their own. As a Brit I never needed to have a sing along with my squadron mates as we ran to feel we were a unit. And people could take the piss out of us without us spitting the dummy, in the British Forces we take the piss out of everyone else and expect the same to be done to us by others."
"Fat chicks.
Sorry fatties."
Is iit ethical to sell fetus's ?
"And you don't do the same to American culture, in different ways of course? Oh wait, nvm, you're just a filthy troll!"
"They didn't come here because they wanted to. They came because they needed to. To save their life. Because  healthcare in Canada wasn't going to give them the surgery they needed, in time. Every single one I talked to, said the same thing. They all needed surgery immediately and couldn't get it in Canada. Canadians come for better healthcare, we go to Canada and Mexico for cheaper prescription medication. "
"a) The sources linked at the bottom seem pretty reliable.

b) The idea of the maple leaf as a national symbol came from quebec. The symbology of the leaf came to evolve to signify maple in general as it came to be a symbol commonly associated with canada."

"You're kinda wrong.

The US hasn't lost a war for a very long time, they didn't even lose Vietnam. They abandoned it because of protests at home, not anything the Vietnamese did.

Iraq and Afghanistan were outstanding military victories that utterly crushed the established states. It's the occupation and nation-building part that came next that failed."
"No. Nobody fucking said Public schools were a slippery slope to socialism. Public schools were along way, way before Marx was born. What are you talking about"
Okay pal.  It's clear that you are an expert on the subject of war and the implications of it.  Go back to your algebra homework now so you can play COD without your mum yelling at you.

Like I didn't used to live in America? Dude I met people in their thirties who'd never been outside their home state. I'm not the one in a bubble.
"What indiginous people have no access to roads and water? They are literally given everything they need. I dont think the government needs to bend over backwards when the majority of these people cant even begin to want to better themselves. Ive lived very close to reserves my whole life, and seeing nothing but broken down houses and overgrown lawns full of people who dont give a fuck about anything. Then in the nicest area, you have the ""chief"" who has 100% control over the money given to the tribe by the govenrment who has 3-4 new trucks, brand new houses and a garage full of toys. The indiginous people of canada need to stop whining about ehat happened 200 years ago and begging for handouts and work with eachother to better themselves."

"So do you lick the toilet bowl after it's been cleaned? Would you have a problem with that if your SO said it really turned them on? Sorry, it's just disgusting. It's like watching these prisoners prepare food in their toilets. It don't matter if it passed a health inspection, it's just disgusting.

I just can't get past the disgust factor. But hey, if it's what you like, who am i to say?"
"Then do yourself a favor, and never watch any R-rated comedy, ever. "
"Because I have nothing better to do with my time? I find it extremely unbelievable that something like that would go on in a school in front of an already prudent teacher.



As for the ""harassing"" that I'm doing, I can't believe you would call someone doubting a story on the internet ""harassing"""
"And it's been on a rise since the 60's. What's your point. If you're going to arbitrarily pick a decade you can say crime is up or down since that specific point in time. 

None of that addresses whether crime is presently ""rising"" as in higher than it was last year, and in the immediate years before that. 

But as you say, keep believing whatever you feel deep down, sport. Who needs facts or reality? "

It doesn't. OP is full of shit. 
I don't think tigers are legal to have as pets. Also saying which is more dangerous alcohol or cannabis depends on the context of the situation.
Thank you for anecdotal evidence. We commend you
I dont think schools really do this. At my school we had special courses and clubs specifically for women in technology. Women in genreal just seem to prefer fields that happen to pay less
"Even the most experienced individuals can make mistakes that lead to tragic results. Humans make errors.

I apologize if my use of kids was construed as dismissive, that wasn't my intent. 

I guess I'm just kind of puzzled that so many people seem to think it was this paranormal, super creepy, crazy conspiracy thing. I love unsolved mysteries, but everything I've read on this topic seems to indicate that it was just a group of friends who made some fatal and tragic mistakes and little more.  "

"Perhaps you need to actually try it. I haven't either and still smells like shit to me, but in my experience people that regularly consume it say it smells good.

Advice: if you're gonna try marijuana eat it, don't smoke it. Your lungs will appreciate it."
Yep...

"&gt; You haven't caught any of the vaccinated diseases because of herd immunity.

How many adults over 18 are vaccinated 100% according to the CDC's requirements? I highly doubt it's anywhere near 80%. Vaccines lose their effectiveness over the years. After about 10 years any vaccine induced immunity is gone. After kids have their initial rounds of vaccines many people are lax about getting boosters. So really herd immunity is a fallacy. It's great in theory but most of the adult population is walking around unvaccinated.

Will this get downvoted? Sure will. That's fine. People need to consider getting past 6 o'clock news knowledge and off reddit island."
"Honestly, I don't know why you are being downvoted. Overtime on his twitter the dicks started to get bigger, have slightly different shape, the blown out asshole looks straight photo shopped. They started to.. not be so attached at the base when he first showed it off. It is absolutely fake."

Elect him president.

"Sorry, but the latest election was a shit sandwich.  

The only upset people were the ones who actually WANTED one of those two as president.. neither was my first or second choice, and most of my friends agree with that assessment.

If Hillary was your first choice (gag) then wow, ok...

If Trump was your first choice (wtf) then wow, Ok...

Sorry, but there is no end to the amount of confident idiots in the world - including myself - but there HAS to be better candidates out there than what the D &amp; R two-party selected for us..  FFS"
"That sounds very reasonable, what's the problem? 

EDIT: Wow, people who break speeding laws disgust me. "

Wowowowowowowowowowtfffffff?
Yea I hate when people say LANGUAGE EVOLVES! Yea well you're letting ignorant dummies dictate how the language changes. No. You correct them firmly until they get it. Does that mean that in 10 years could of will replace could've? I don't think so. 
"Well, I don't want to see you go. And you're telling me basically ""np bud, you have fun but I'll have less fun because you choose to have more fun"".

Someone might not get offended, but it makes it *less* fun. So by you choosing to present such an ultimatum, no matter what I choose, we're *having less fun*.

And parties are for fun.

I don't like doing many things. If myself gets invited to uhm... idk, a party by the pool, and I hate and cannot swim, I *am not gonna show up for the drinks and then tell everyone not to get into the water or I'll leave you*.

And if I do come, which I try to do more often, I consciously step out of my comfort zone, and try to participate, since I subscribed by the means of agreeing to the invitation to the activities and not to be a bitching fun spoiler. And since eventually it might be even good for me.

No offense implied, mate. I understand the analogy might be challenged, but *I just wanted to provide the reasoning from the other point of view*.

If not the reasoning (some of other valid points have been made already), then at least the motivation."
The fact that it portrays an abusive relationship is not a criticism.
your social studies teacher greatly exaggerated the evils of Columbus and the morally bankrupt society that produced him. Shame on them for brainwashing 7th graders. Fuck that guy. 
Get back to me when you learn to read a graph. I'll be here.
"But how can you be different and one not be superior? Those differences create superiority/inferiority.

A knife and a fork are both cutlery, but they are different, a knife is superior at cutting and a fork is superior at stabbing."
Prove that human activity is the direct cause of global warming. No models. No forecasts. Proof.
That is so interesting! Thanks for sharing!
