"To me the best episode has always been ""Pinewood Derby"", where Randy, dressed up as Princess Leia, busts into a top secret facility to steal technology so that Stan can win the Pinewood Derby. And what starts out as a little lie that Stans pinewood derby car is built using only legal parts, escalates exponentially, when the derby car reaches hyper speed, busts through the wall and into space. And ofc Randy, still reluctant to admit lying, has to prove to aliens how he built the car that reached hyper speed. And then, as only reasonable thing to do, kills the visiting alien, just to discover that the Alien had a huge stack of ""Space money"". Now the whole world wants to have a peice of the space money, but as space police visits Randy, He has to not only make sure Stan keeps quiet about what Randy has done, but also every country in the world that received some space money. Which is hard to do when Mexico suddenly has built a huge amount of water parks, and they have to nuke Finland, as Finland is about to rat them out. All this commotion just because Randy woulden't admit to using illegal pinewood derby parts.      
      
The plot is so ridiculous, yet so relatable to real world. Which for me is what makes the best South Park episodes."
"**Randy:** ...I'm not gonna go.

**Sharon:** What?

**Randy:** Stan's little league game, I'm.. I'm not gonna go.

**Sharon:** Why?

**Randy:** I Just.. don't think I can, alright?

**Sharon:** You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Why wouldn't you go and support him? What-?

**Randy:**  Because I'm scared, all right?! You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore. I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.

**Sharon:** So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!

**Randy:** Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.

**Sharon:** No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself.

**Randy:** I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone."
