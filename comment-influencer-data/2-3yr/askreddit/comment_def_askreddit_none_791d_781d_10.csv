"On that note;

My parents used to be total nazis about the heat and AC.
EDIT: They still are, I just don't have to live with them and deal with it! :-D

We were solidly middle class, def not poor, yet in the winter, we'd keep the heat very low and if I complained about being cold, it was ""put on a sweater! Put on socks! Put on a heavier sweater!"" Etc. etc.

Same in the summer; they'd keep the A/C high (like 80+ if it was even on at all) and I'd just have to deal with it.

Now that I own my own home and make enough money to not care about a few extra bucks of heating or A/C bills, I do whatever the F^&amp;*( I want; in the winter especially, soon as I wake up, I'll crank that heat to 90 if I'm so inclined.

**There have literally been days in the winter when I leave the house sweaty bc I had the heat cranked up so high.** LOL.

And I relish every moment of it."

I went through a HUGE Beatles phase for like 5 years. I got super upset when my sister told me that her bf went through the same phase. Obviously it wasn't just a phase; I was gonna be obsessed with the band for the rest of my life. Spoiler alert: it def ended.
