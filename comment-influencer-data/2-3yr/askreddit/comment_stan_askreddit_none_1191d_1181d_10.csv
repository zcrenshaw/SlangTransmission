"I'm not a defense attorney, but I worked a brief stint at the Public Defender's Office during law school. While I worked there, I took care of a lot of bail hearings and other simpler things. 

If you spend any time working for the PD, you will quickly learn the names of the repeat offenders who come in on a monthly--if not weekly-- basis. One such fellow, let's call him Stan, liked to do drugs. I was informed by the DA's office that he had a warrant out for a probation violation. So I gave Stan a call and told him to turn himself in.

Now, as I said, Stan was a regular and knew all of the drills. If you turn yourself in (or get picked up) after a certain time, you wear your street clothes in front of the judge instead of the sexy little jumpsuit.

As it turns out, he turned himself in with a crack pipe in his pocket. This can't get any worse, right? Wrong. I'm thinking that Stan has to be the dumbest man to face that courtroom when I look up and see him being escorted into the courtroom by the bailiff wearing a shirt that says, ""High as Fuck"".

Let's just say his bail hearing was about as successful as the rest of his life choices."
