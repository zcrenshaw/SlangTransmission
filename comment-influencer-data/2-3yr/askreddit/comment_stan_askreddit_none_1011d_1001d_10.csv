"""Stan"" by Eminem"
"Second and last guy I dated seriously was a pet doctor. He was young and establishing his practice, had practically no staff except for his vet tech who was a married woman. I'm an animal freak and good with people, computers, so I helped him out for an hour or two sometimes around my other job. He was great vet and I wanted him to make it. I cared about him, thought there might be something real happening there. He said so. Told me he loved me in fact. 

I come in one morning and I hear giggles. He's on the examining table with the vet tech and they are playing human doctor. He saw me, went all UH OH and tried to button up but it was over. I turned around, walked out and never talked to him again. Didn't answer his calls, his notes on my door, nothing. Cut him dead. He was frantic. He knew what he had lost and he wasn't happy about it. He sent me gifts, tried everything to get me to talk to him. Nope. 

It was fortunate that we had not actually slept together at that point. We'd been talking a lot about it and I'd just gotten on birth control again. I wanted him to get tested for STD's before we went there. He'd had a lot more partners than I. He'd agreed, had an appt to do that that week actually. We probably would have gone to bed very soon but I'm ever so glad now that we hadn't. He had told me though that we were exclusive in anticipation of what was likely to be us involved that way soon. I had no reason to expect him to be more interested in being with me soon than with boning his much married VT. 

Dodged a bullet, not sorry, either.

I'm not too  flexible on the infidelity thing. Once a man tells me I am his only GF and that he loves me I expect the courtesy of him keeping his pants zipped if he wants to be with me. I don't cheat, ever. The guy could be fucking Sebastian Stan (current mega crush) and I would still dump his ass ASAP for doing that to me even if doing so broke my heart. A guy wants to bone others, okay, I get it, some people are not naturally monogamous, he needs to be honest and not lead me on. You leave before you fuck someone else. That's the polite thing to do. 

You don't risk your partner's health or cause them undue heartache. That's just lazy and inconsiderate. Some people they just don't get that they can't have both. I really don't like people like that, who lie and lead on genuinely monogamous people. It's one thing to not be and admit that, give someone like me a choice. It's another to hide, lie and cheat knowing the other person really cares and will be devastated when they find out you are cheating.  "
