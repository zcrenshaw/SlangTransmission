"Tbh BV is actually badass as hell since essentially the vaginal pH goes off the charts to corrosive acidity levels to kill off the unwelcome bacteria. Can dissolve colouring and even cotton fibers of underwear. Def one of the most badass illnesses 

EDIT/UPDATE: Regular vagina juices can also bleach underwear and make holes..! It can also have a pH all over the place, as well as BV can also if you're unlucky cause the ph might rise instead of decrease. So I may have oversimplified things. 

Basically those of you with bleached underwear, dw it's probably not BV, more likely your vagina is just working hard af to get rid of invaders "
"When I was a teenager my friends and I were all into that kind of music (I'm still into rock music but not screamo really) and I can remember a bunch of my friends, on different occasions, meeting Oli at shows or paying for VIP passes to get the autographs and every story was the same.. he's a dick. Idk if it's just a persona or if he's actually a dick.

There's also another guy I can't remember his name right now it's been so many years since I've listened to his music but he's pretty much a rapist. Def was having sex with kids that listened to his music. I'm pretty sure word got out about it though.

Update: as many pointed out correctly, his name is Dahvie he was from Blood on the dance floor. He tried to get two of my friends to meet up with him at a hotel. They were 14 at the time and very clearly 14 I don't think it was a case of mistaken identity. They told him no because their parents were not far away and then he told them to message him on MySpace. They bragged about this for a while then a couple  years later we found out this was SUPER common and he was doing this with girls at basically every show or public appearance."
Moved from West Texas to South Carolina for a couple years. I felt like I had to morph into a higher species to adequately process air. Dry heat def the way to go.
