"A few things...

I really enjoy helping people with computer stuff online (I'm a regular on a certain sub's daily questions thread and proud of being able to help).  Can't tell anyone in real life because I'd become their go-to tech support and frankly, they don't treat me as well as the internet strangers I help.

I started doing video game streaming earlier this year.  I only really stream one game once per day (anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour or so typically).  I started a Youtube channel to backup all my streams (Twitch exports yay!).  I have next to no followers or subscribers (I forget about followers, 4 subs on Youtube - one of which is my brother), so no reason to be proud there.  The real reason I'm so proud of myself is for sticking to it despite my horrible stage fright.  Being in front of that camera every day is terrifying.  The possibility that any number of people could see me do something stupid or make a mistake is terrifying.  But that's really why I do it.  Not ""just to see if it's fun"" like I told everyone.  I wanted to force myself to face my fears every day and I've done it (and am still doing it - see you tonight Twitch!).

Quick edit with the obligatory ""omg, this blew up"" message here: I appreciate all of you posting that you're watching my videos/subbing to my channel.  Please don't feel like you have to subscribe or anything just because you saw this post though.  I completely get that my videos won't be entertaining for everyone (probably not most people). :P

Edit 2: I have ~~39~~ ~~42~~ ~~oh god, help~~ ~~50~~ 75 unread emails from Twitch (all new follower notifications) thanks to you guys.  Mega Stan will be pleased for all of you to watch me inevitably fail during tonight's stream."
