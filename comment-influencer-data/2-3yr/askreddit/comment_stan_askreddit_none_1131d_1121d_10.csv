"Can't believe this question has popped up in my Reddit feed on today, of all days.  This afternoon, my wife and I were just remembering an amazing friend of mine, Kevin, who died a little more than 18 years ago.  We did the math and realized that the son he left behind is now the same age that Kevin was when he passed, which gave me pause, to say the least.  Kevin died from a recurrence of the same type of cancer that had first shown up in him while he was still in his teens.  The same cancer (seriously, fuck cancer) had also taken his father also at the age of 34 when Kev was just about the same age as his kid.  He was a warm, funny, kind, no-bullshit guy who had zero capacity for flowery-talk or mysticism, you know?  He was a real cash-and-carry kind of dude.  So, you'll understand why his last conversation with me has comforted me for nearly two decades, now.  

I went in to visit him at the hospital on what ended up being the final day of his life and, when he and I were finally alone, he leaned over to me and said ""Stan, there have been angels in my room, on and off, since just before sunrise.""  I ask him if he thought it was the morphine (which, normally, he would have been the first to suggest/lol), and he said ""No, I'm not fucking with you, buddy... I'm not talking about 'feeling' angels or anything... There are actual angels who keep coming into my room.""  I asked him if they were frightening and he replied, ""No, they're actually making me calm the fuck down a little bit.""  He passed, later that evening. 

You know, I have always had (and still have) doubts about there being anything after this life.  And, of course, the pragmatic part of my brain recognizes that it certainly could have been the medications he was taking, or some further metastasis to his brain, right?  But, if I'm being honest about what my gut tells me, or, my heart?  There were angels in my friend's room.

You know what?  Fuck it, I'm going to share one more story about him... A few weeks before the time I just shared, the two of us were talking about the possibility of an afterlife.  He had just gotten word that things had taken a grim turn and that he probably had only weeks left to live, so, it was a pretty earnest conversation.  We discussed the idea of there being a Heaven, with a gate, and I asked him who he would like to be the first person he got to see after being let inside... and the fucker answered ""You.""  Then, after we had laughed ourselves fucking hoarse, he added ""No... I want to see my dogs from childhood.""  

I'm going to go hug my wife now.  

Much love, strangers.  
Much, much love. 


Edit -- Hey, everyone... Writing this about 20 hours after the fact.  I can't even begin to tell you what a jolt it's been for my wife and I to log into my account and see the outpouring of love my little note inspired in so many of you guys.  We've been sitting together at our kitchen table for the last few minutes, just reading through your comments, both of us (embarrassingly/lol) blubbering grateful tears.  A few of you have asked about Kevin's son and I'm happy to be able to tell you that he is very much healthy, alive, and full of the same glorious piss and vinegar as his father.  And, yes, his family doctor is well aware of the familial history of that fucking disease and he is well looked after.  All is well. HE is well. :)

This tiny thing that has happened, here... all of you being so lovely and kind and generous?  This is the shit that keeps me coming back to this Reddit community.  

Mad love, friends.
