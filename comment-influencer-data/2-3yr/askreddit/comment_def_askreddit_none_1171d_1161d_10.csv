"When I joined the Navy I kept hearing how awesome all the ports would be.  We would go to Singapore, then Thailand, and while we were in Thailand,  a stripper would lower from the ceiling on a rope and she would sit on the dick of one of us sailors and the rest of us would grab her legs and twirl her.   I was really looking forward to this, then, while we were in Australia, an alarm sounded.  All us sailors were taken out of the bars and brought back to the ship.  We raced to the middle of the ocean and sat there, without seeing land, for nearly a year.   It started to get to us.  A lot of us got shipeyes.  Shipeyes is when a girl who's a 2 becomes a ten.  One such girl was a six foot three redhead that we called big red. Big red      Made over 30 thousand bucks by turning tricks.  We had ATMs on the ship and whenever payday came, tons of sailors came.  She was as unattractive a woman as I've ever seen, but ship eyes is a motherfucker.  She almost got away with it, but then she bought a motorcycle with the cash and got caught.  While we were out there, a dude who nobody liked had a foxtail (slang for cleaning brush) shoved up his ass.  I got skin cancer because my boss didn't like me and made me stand out on the deck while we were at the equator knowing damn well I was too white to be out there.  I saw flying fish that ate seagulls, sea snakes that looked like spirited away dragons, fifty tiger sharks swimming in formation like they were in boot camp, and a bunch more shit happened but I'll tell it later.  I can't even remember why I started writing this.  

Here's part two: 

My military experience was nuts. We were sitting on that sea for months, you know, cuz of 9/11 and all, and every second I was thinking we were gonna get bombed or killed. In the end, my biggest threats were my bosses. My bosses treated me and everyone else like ass. Being in the Navy is like being in the movie Office Space, except you can't quit. My bosses had bosses who had bosses and they all broke us down. While I was on the ship a few guys killed themselves. More than a few. Just under ten, I think. I wanted to kill myself at one point, but I didn't, not unless I'm a ghost right now, ghost typing. Hell, I even heard about a dude who used to be my roommate in A school (military photography school) who killed himself on another ship. It was the weirdest thing. I heard he was getting treated like shit, and he couldn't take it anymore, so he jumped onto the flight deck. Flight decks are like fucking pizza cutters. Nasty way to go. Anyways, I heard from a lot of people he jumped, then, months later, I saw his picture in a paper and it said he died an honorable death and blah, blah, blah. He got treated like shit, and he couldn't take it anymore. But on a lighter note, when we got back to port, I injured my knee, and guess what? My bosses thought I was faking it so they made me come back on the ship while I was wearing a full leg cast. Ship ladders are fucking steep. I had crutches, and while I was going up the ladder, I ate shit, injured my other knee, and since then I've had 4 knee surgeries. There's so much more weird shit that happened. Not all depressing. Some funny. I'll def tell more. Bootcamp was hilarious and depressing. Two more things I remember. I almost died a million times, but here's two weird ones. I was a photographer. Photographers on the ship are as useless a useless can be. We take pictures of people who reenlist. They always have a dumb cake and I'm there to photograph their dumb cake and this shit eating grin on their face as they cut that cake. Anyways, I was bored one day and I went to the top of the ship to take a picture of....the sky, the water, some bullshit like that....anyways, I saw a ladder going up to this big ass antenna on the very top of the ship. I started climbing it when I head a voice yelling for me to get down. It was my chief. The one nice boss I had. I asked him what was wrong and he told me to come down. I came down and he pointed to the big ass antenna. after a minute or two a seagull flew up to the antenna, and right before it got up to it, it died and fell onto the deck. Turns out, if I had gone anywhere near that antenna thing, I would have been vaporized or whatever. Another time, I was sent to the bottom of the ship to take pictures of this hovercraft. When I got down there, me and this other dude were bullshitting, then, right as the hovercraft is coming in, I feel a rope pinching my leg. I start to get moved by the rope. It's a big ass rope. I can't get away. It's pinching me. It's pinching the other dude. Out of nowhere, I feel a hand grab the back of my shirt and lift me up, over the rope. It was a short marine dude. He lifted my tall ass and the tall ass dude next to me right over our death. Turns out the rope was a mooring line, and if the tiny marine dude hadn't lifted us up, we would have been cut in half by it. Many sailors have been cut in half by that shit. Also, one last quick one. One of my bosses who hated me, he told me to go out on a hovercraft with some marines and film some stuff. Since we were photographers, since we were basically worthless, not all of us had camouflage. We had, like, 3 outfits that we had to share. I asked my boss if I could use a set of them and he said nope, go out in my blue navy uniform. Well, I went to the hovercraft and the Marine boss took one look at me and said, nope, you go out there like that, no camo, you will get killed by whatever enemy was out there. I went and told my boss and he smiled. That cocksucker smiled. He would rather me have gotten killed than use his camo. One more thing, while I was working in the galley, I had a Filipino boss named caca-urien. We used to call him shit piss. :) I'll tell more about bootcamp and what happened after, later, for sure. 

Part three.  

Thanks for all the love.  A few of you said I should make a subreddit, so I did, it's called: blessingnavystories I just posted some more stuff there.  I'll keep posting there from now on. I got even crazier shit to tell you and yes, It's all true.  Also, I had a few people say they couldn't find the sub. If you go to the manually enter a subreddit option and type in blessingnavystories it will come up.  "

He was the kind of guy who drinks Budweiser, wears an American flag bandana and those sunglasses that construction workers and white trash dick heads wear. [These.](http://skateparkoftampa.com/spot/images/dav9glasses.jpg)

And you always knew he was fixing to get arrested when Def Leppard's *Pour some sugar on me* would start playing. It was like his domestic violence anthem."
