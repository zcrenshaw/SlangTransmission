"As a paralegal who just (luckily) got away from a family law office to a defender's office, this gave me a migraine. I've seen some very stupid things in family law, but this?! They aren't married, and common law marriage doesn't apply in almost any state at all due to how hard it would be to enforce in the first place... She actually filed?!?!

Def saving this comment for later."

"Eh, I had a friend in a similar situation, his mom was really controlling and sheltering. It pretty much will end on bad terms. People like his mother are so conceited they won't even understand, they'll just frame it as you hating her or some such nonsense. 

Not saying he shouldn't do it, but it most def don't end clealy."
