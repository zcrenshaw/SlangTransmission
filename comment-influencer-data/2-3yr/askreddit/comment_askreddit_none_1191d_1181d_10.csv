Yes, you're supposed to monitor your accounts and report discrepancies ""immediately"", which in bank-legal speak means within 90 days upon receiving your statement of accounts.

However since the op mentioned that he never used the account in the past years, it would have been plausible to believe he just filed the statements away, thinking that nothing had happened in the meantime.

And since the money would have remained in the account and not spent, there would be no indication of fraud. Even a decade later, the transaction could have been easily reversed without issues."

He also misdiagnosed me as having anemia despite lacking any symptoms (same as my mom and great aunt), which I quickly figured out was part of his racket to prescribe unnecessary vitamin shots. I insisted on going back to my pediatrician for a second opinion and stuck with him as my doctor until adulthood.

We later found out that quack doctor got arrested for diddling teenage boys, so I have a sneaking suspicion his concern about my spiritual wellbeing may not have been genuine."

"I don't really have much of a great story. Just your average run-of-the-mill person who lived life low-key. I wasn't searching for anything great but wasn't going to pass up on opportunities. I mostly needed the small push to get me going. 

I had a really awesome job for an entry level position and a part-time job as a waitress making bank, working out, lived with an aunt and uncle but still maintained independence. I met a Hawaiian guy through a mutual friend and we hit it off. It was a long distance relationship we kept up with for a good six months. We were constantly talking to each other every possible waking/work hour and sleeping on cam on skype because of the time difference. Him, Hawaiian time, me, Central time.

I was looking into going back to school after being in the work force for two to three years. I was almost done with my degree but because of bills and life, I put my degree on hold. I was talking about the choices I have to go back to school and my mother pipes in, ""Why don't you move in with Hawaiian guy?""

Three months later, several thousand bucks in my pocket, a one-way ticket to Hawaii, dropped my great paying job, burned a few bridges that were much needed, solidified relationships I wanted to keep, landed my ass in Oahu.

I just passed my one year mark June 2nd. I found another great paying job, having a great time with the love of my life with plans to get married. My only advice is to have backup plans so you can bow out gracefully."

I hate fish so I haven't eaten any during my pregnancy, but you'd be surprised how many things you'd heard weren't safe during pregnancy that actually are fine, or the ""rule"" is super specific, or broad.  For example I remember always hearing NO CAFFEINE DURING PREGNANCY to the point I thought you couldn't even have chocolate, and I had a girlfriend who would drink Pepsi while pregnant and I remember in my head always having that ""should you be having that?!"" thought (thank god I'm not an idiot and never actually said anything).  Then I got pregnant and learned its actually totally fine to have up to around 200mg of caffeine a day.  Now for some people who order triple venti espresso whatever the fucks, that probably means no, but for people like me who are tea or cola drinkers, it's still possible to enjoy one each day!
TL;DR the ""rules"" are usually less broad than you may have heard, and if you see a pregnant lady eating/drinking something you thought they shouldn't be, there's a good chance that they've looked in to it and it's fine! "

"This. It says a lot about your fanbase when they're widely known to boo any opening act at a show for no reason other than being the opening act. The entitlement level is off the charts for a depressingly large portion of their listeners.

Another example: When 10,000 Days leaked, a fair amount of fans decided the leak was a decoy because... They didn't like it. Rather than accept that their favorite band put out something that didn't do it for them, they believed it was a conspiracy and raged around the internet about it.

I love Tool's music, Aenima and Lateralus are amongst my favorite albums of all time, but when they come up in music discussions I usually have to qualify my enjoyment with ""but I'm not one of *those* people.""  I never have to do that with any other bands."

"I was driving my older, very big SUV at about 45 mph.  A thought popped into my head about what I would do if the brakes went out.  A few seconds later, traffic came to a quick stop.  I put my foot on the brake pedal, and it went to the floor and stayed there.  The brake arm (the metal piece that connects the pedal to the brake cylinder) snapped, so the beast of a truck had no brakes at all.  I did what I imagined a few seconds before, down-shifted, swerved off the road, barely missing the car in front of me, barreled between two parked cars, jumped a curb blowing both front tires, hit the emergency brake, and stopped in someone's lawn.

The non-psychic explanation I have come up with is that I was subconsciously feeling something very slightly wrong with the brake pedal, which caused the thought process, just in the nick of time."

"I don't know if this counts. I was never hit or slapped. 

When she got mad at me, she would basically tell me she didn't love me. When I would try to remedy things, she would be silent and physically do things that made me think she hated me. She would push me away, she would prevent me from hugging her, she would pick my arm up and move it if it was close to her. She would masturbate while I was in the room while I was crying. I don't know if she got emotional pleasure from it, but I felt it was degrading. Whenever she was mad she would dress up and go out by herself. 

I called the suicide hotline at least 3 times a year because I felt she was my only friend and lover, and she hated me. I even went so far as to put a gun in my mouth. She stopped it, obviously. 

I never once yelled at her, I always told her that I loved her, and even when she was mad, I would kiss her goodnight. I cherished each moment as if it were the last day on earth.

Eventually, we broke up, which sent me into a state of having zero emotion or extreme anxiety. One day, she calls me, drunk, asking me to fuck her. I said no. A week later, she told me she fucked someone else, just to get a response.

That was like getting my heart stepped on. I wanted to marry this girl and have children with her at some point. Her parents were *my* parents. 

So I got fed up and stopped talking to her. She would get upset when I didn't want to be friends. She even told me that it bothered her when she thought about how close we used to be compared to now, when we're nothing. 

Eventually, I had to cut off contact with her for my own sanity.

Folks, the takeaway from this is:

**You need to have love for yourself, guys.**

You can't sacrifice the love for yourself by giving it all to your significant other. I felt that having unconditional love was the noble thing to do. Don't fucking do this to yourself. When the relationship ends, and it will, you will feel like a husk of a person."

"You might be looking for something that 21 year old girls can't really give yet. Try meeting new types of people by going to things you never would normally, maybe you'll like the people that go to those things. 
You also might want a lot of the pros of a relationship like someone to chliche-ly hold at night but the cons like your sacrifice of autonomy with regards to certain personal aspects of the relationship might not really be worth the trade to your deeper self so you're preventing it subconsciously or something like that. That's what gets me.
Or you might just have a weirdly coincidental streak of girls where you're not their type or etc.
Or you could be missing some pretty open opportunities with high standards for a person, or high standards from an interaction standpoint meaning to say you want it to go down like a tv show or a movie which is a lot like having very high attractiveness standards, it's only for the situation rather than the person, and you put way too much perfection pressure on the interactions making them a bit awkward.

All in all there's a ton of things it could be cuz relationships need a lot of input and there's a ton of behind the scenes as well as lucky stuff that needs to go down for them. You're probably not weird because weird people are oddities, and by definition you're probably just average, but the thing is so is everyone else. Ease up and just live, it'll happen when it happens. Life isn't a tv show, stuff isn't just black and white, you're an individual with individual tastes, and so are all these girls. The harder you try the worse it seems and the harder it is. Play on easy mode (single) a little longer and grind those skill stats and personality perks up while you still have all that time."

"My friends upstairs. When I was 9 I lived with my dad and my brother in the basement suit of a 2 story house in Victoria, BC. There were 2 girls living upstairs that we were friends with. We would run around in the backyard and make forts and just do kid things. When I was 10 my brother and I went to live with our mom (our choice, dad is a great dad) in Vancouver. We visited my dad on a monthly basis so I still got to see the girls upstairs until they moved when I was 13. Up until that point they were ordinary girls, nothing seemed wrong and they had just about everything they could ask for. We didn't visit my dad for about 6 months after they moved because my mom briefly had ovarian cancer (he came and visited us). When we went back for the first time both girls looked noticeably thinner. Like MUCH thinner. My brother and I heard yelling almost every night and they didn't want to come out to play anymore. We only saw them walking in or out of the house after that point. When I was 14 my dad had mentioned how the older one of the girls went missing for a few days and was found at her boyfriends house who was 21. She apparently had got into a huge fist fight with her mom, stormed out and  ran away. Last I heard of her was last year (I'm 17) and she overdosed on cocaine and method and had been arrested multiple times for theft and assault. Her sister didn't turn out too well, she got pregnant at 14, drank and smoke with the baby, got an abortion, then developed HIV from her partners all before she turned 16. When she turned 17 she decided to drive high on xanax and coke and slammed into a wall going 120kph (75mph) and was hospitalized for a week but ended up dying in the hospital. Their mother is a very nice lady who provided them with everything and its a shame to see two lives go to waste."

"Quitting Wal-Mart,

 I had worked there for just over a year in 1996, I went from pushing carts, to receiving clerk, to associate in hardware, , to service desk, to customer service manager all in a year.

I was a CSM, one sunny June day. The service desk lady and one cashier called in sick. Being the Jack of all trades I filled in for the service desk, and for some odd reason the service desk had a massive amount of customer bringing shit back. 

This one lady had a radar detector, no package, no receipt, no cord , no bracket, etc... After punching in the model number I explained to her we never sold this model radar detector at any time. Well she started raising Hell, and wouldn't leave. She demanded to speak to a manager. Being a CSM technically I am the manager of that situation. So I asked her to step aside and let the next person through. I start on the next person. Next person brought an empty doughnut box and said he didn't like the doughnuts so he gets twice his money back. (That 200% satisfaction guaranteed shit) So I said. "" You ate the whole box, If you didn't like them you're supposed to bring in the remaining portion for your money back, not the empty box."" Then he started arguing. The crowd behind them was growing petty impatient.  Then radar lady chimed in with. ""I want a real Manager."" I ended up saying something like. LOOK YOU STUPID BITCH, WE DON'T EVEN CARRY THAT BRAND OF RADAR DETECTOR! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE! Followed by silence and gasps and one dude going ""YEEEAH!"" And clapping in the back. I look back at doughnut man looking at me with this ""OH shit"" look unclipped my nametag handed him my red vest and said ""FUCK THIS SHIT, I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT! I'M GOING TO THE  BEACH! Right in his face.

So I clocked out and, went to the beach, hooked up with some friends went to a pizza place one of the friends worked at and got a job delivering pizzas that same night THEN went to a party I delivered pizzas to later that night had a blast. Was one of the best days of my life. 

Thank you radar bitch.

"when it was time to say goodbye in a pretty emotional situation (and me having to control myself to not cry like a little baby) he said i'm the nicest and kindest person he has ever met and super level-headed and fun to hang out with and that he is sure i will go far in life with ""how smart i am"". and that i should keep going my own way even if its not the usual one and just ignore all haters. i should just be careful that i dont get used by people anymore because of my kindness. he said all of that while hugging me the whole time while speaking. and yeah... considering i thought of myself as being dumb ugly and boring and just overall pretty useless...yeah..was a huge and meaningful compliment for me, especially coming from a 51year old guy i had something similar as a crush on, crush maybe takes it too far, not sure (im 25...but he had no idea how much i liked him anyway..and i will probably never tell him either - even if he ends up calling or visiting me like he said he would do after i get back home from traveling around). but this moment i will never forget. he said all of that infront of 21 other people who just waited to tell me goodbye, too.

this guy alone and spending so much time with him and a few others in all my time there at the hospital changed my view on everything in such a strong way and made me so much more confident. couldnt thank him enough and i really believe that he meant what he said, i trust this man blind. "

"I had a friend who would never let me come over to his house. I didn't know why because I'd met his mother and father and knew his siblings and they seemed like a very happy normal family and they had a nice home which I'd see often from the outside and inside through the living room window a couple times. One time however I managed to convince him to ask his mother if we could have a sleep over and she said yes. After a few moments of being there I realised why he was reluctant to let anyone over.

There were locks on every single door in the house. But not only that, every door required a different key and there was a set of keys for each door for each member of the six person family. In the Entrance Hall alone there must of been 30 keys on a rack.

To give one ""short"" example of how to get to the Bathroom from the Living Room and back again, you would have to:

- Take Living Room - Entrance Hall key from its specific place in the Living Room.

- Unlock the Entrance Hall door. Go through then lock the door behind you.

- Store the Living Room - Entrance Hall key in its specific place in the Entrance Hall.

- Take Bathroom key from its specific place in the Entrance Hall.

- Unlock the Bathroom door. Go through then lock the door behind you.

- Unlock the Bathroom door. Go through then lock the door behind you. 

- Store the Bathroom door key in its specific place in the Entrance Hall.

- Take the Living Room - Entrance Hall key from its specific place in the Entrance Hall.

- Unlock the Living Room door. Go through then lock the door behind you.

- Place the Living Room - Entrance Hall key in its specific place in the living room. 

Every. Single. Time.  And it was a large house. Sometimes requiring going through 3 or 4 doors to reach the room you wanted.

It honestly felt like I was playing real life Resident Evil, collecting keys to open doors to progress. My friend was the only one who found it slightly embarasing his sisters and brother and parents didn't seem to think it was odd at all. I asked my friend why it was like that and he just said his Mother thought it was safer for them all that way. I never stayed over again and all sleepovers after that were conducted at my house."

They try to screen out high risk donors to avoid positive tests as much as possible and then count on negative tests from pooled test samples."

When the officer got a warrant and entered the house he found a 3 month decomposed body of a 60 year old man.... natural causes. The phone company said they disconnected that particular line a month prior to the call. That was 2 years ago and there are no leads as to who actually called. the ""hello?"" call is still saved in their system and we pull it up form time to time."

"Years ago my friend was playing guitar in his (not so great) band's debut live performance at a local music venue. He snapped his high e string and hadn't brought a spare guitar, or spare strings. He had to get a string from another performer and then he sat fiddling on the side of the stage with the guitar for about 15 minutes trying to replace the string, and he wasn't very good at it. Plus it was a Floyd rose bridge and he couldn't get it to float properly. It was really cringey watching him struggle while the venue played crappy filler music and his band mates stood around awkwardly. He then continued playing the last 10 minutes of the set with his guitar slightly out of tune. Felt pretty sorry for him really.

"Because everyone don't want to deal with awkward moments of rejection.

"Obligatory ""Not an 80's player, but . . .""

Not an 80's player, but when I first got into the game, in early high school, my dad, a Christian missionary, was one of those people who thought Pokémon and Harry Potter were gateways to devil worship. The first time I played, I mentioned to my dad that I'd watched some friends play, since that was kind of my litmus test for if something was, ""of the devil.""

I got a lecture on how the game was evil and it led to devil worship and to suicide, so I played in secret for a few weeks before the game fell apart. No huge drama.

The weird part was a few years later, after I came back from my first semester of college, I mentioned I had ran a game because fuck you Dad, I do what I want. He thought it was cool, and said something along the lines of, ""Did you know in the 80's people thought this game was demonic? Ha!"" And then we played a family game over Christmas break.

"Except when it's not. Every network will have a bias because they're run exclusively by human beings. So far as I know not a single scientific team has built a genetic or chemical way to suppress basic tenets of human nature. Speaking of human nature news networks like CNN, FOX, and MSNBC aren't political arms of some party or the US government because they don't show all sides or all news stories. They're all in a race for viewership and that again is where human nature comes in. FOX knows that it can attract viewers more right leaning and also by using every PR advantage known to such as vibrant use of the color red and attractive hosts. MSNBC knows it can attract left leaning viewers and tries to go for an intellectual spin. CNN tries for centrist viewers and by being first and repeating to death headline stories. Why? Because they know what attracts people and that's their ultimate goal. Viewership that brings in ad revenue. 

Another constant complaint is that articles that aren't mainstream are never covered. Yeah, because it's not what the majority of people want to hear about. I wouldn't expect a huge expose on FOX concerning Monsanto GMO products because only a very small group of people statistically care. Nor would I expect CNN to run screaming for the hills when a legislative debate over airport improvement funds for the FAA budget is held up. Or a foreign policy online periodical piece on puppies. The news networks write and publish articles that will attract viewers. Once again, human nature rules.

Of course they'll all have government officials come in to support a policy, issue, or action but that's what their job is. Shows like FOX News Sunday are visited all the time because that's how the government deals directly with the public. Since no one in the general public is going out and reading government published policy papers or press releases how else would they realistically get out word that a new reform act is being introduced or a deal with another country is in the works? There are no editors fired or quitting for not touting the line, there aren't government owned agencies telling them what to broadcast, and no reporters murdered or imprisoned for talking about the wrong thing.

"The old days of Reddit, from 2009-2012, Reddit had literally the largest political and news discussion forums in human history, AND most of the mods (holdovers from ~2008) didn't have strict rules. This let strange asides and sometimes biased opinions flourish, but it also let original thoughts, insight, and reporting rise to the top.

All through 2013 and beyond, reddi mods began to be rapidly expanded, replaced, and carved out of iron, seemingly hellbent on using every power afforded to them to enforce the rules indiscrimately...

People began grumbling about the mods, and the largest politics discussion forums in history found themselves crumbling in the muddy waters.

I think it's every bit intentional that this happened.

Collectivization of ideas is, without a doubt, one of the greatest threats to power.

Reddit wasnt there yet, but some of its subs were headed, warts and all, in a grand direction.

And since then, hope has been snuffed...

There can never be what once was, because it is not a native default, and not the sole source of news, where a few users will always be within spitting distance from the stories unfolding.

The water is muddied, the user base fractured, and the mods have changed (I have my suspicions some are paid) 

The threat that Reddit once posed to traditional media, and therefore powerful institutions around the world, is no more.

And I wish I had never seen it then, 7 years ago. I wish I could forget how insanely ahead of the curve Reddit was in those times...because I see Reddit now and I feel like a bright student held back by her terrible public school. But I was there before everything changed, and now there are very few of us who saw what today could have been, instead of the comparatively cruel jape it has become."

"&gt; you would be violently killed by having the iron in your blood being ripped out of your body

I...don't think that's true. You would absolutely die, but mostly from the magnetic field polarizing your entire body and generally fucking your shit up through para/diamagnetism. The iron in your blood isn't actually magnetic (or, at least, any more so than the water in your blood is magnetic) because it's single atoms of iron chelated in Heme groups. Iron is magnetic when present in large quantities and metallically bonded, so the iron in your body is not actually ferromagnetic.

Basically X Men lied to you, is what I'm saying."

"Unfortunately it's not that simple. Most doctors don't have input on who they see during clinic. Someone, usually a call center, schedules patients in a clinic on a certain day. If people arrive 10 minutes early like they're supposed to, then things move smoothly. But sometimes people show up 10 or 15 minutes late, and of course, this causes a domino effect where people have to end up waiting longer. If someone no shows, sometimes you catch up, but doctors usually can't just schedule an open slot. "

Canvas was started at BYU by some graduate students.

I knew him for years and never had any idea he was involved. It was just a few months ago that I was logging into Canvas (I've gone back to school) and had a faint memory of someone saying that Canvas was started by some BYU students so I looked it up out of curiosity and found out that it was my buddy that did it... I never said this was an interesting story.

"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleoside triphosphate used in cells as a coenzyme often called the ""molecular unit of currency"" of intracellular energy transfer. Metabolic processes that use ATP as an energy source convert it back into its precursors. ATP is therefore continuously recycled in organisms: the human body, which on average contains only 250 grams (8.8 oz) of ATP, turns over its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day. this single coenzyme is responsible for powering all cellular function in all known life."
"Yeah, like me a 34M. If a woman told me something like that we would have several really long and deep talks about what we want and would do everything to determine if we would be a good long term match. If it turns out we would be a good long term match marriage would be absolutely on the table quickly.

I want a family. I want a wife and kids. And I want us all to have a comfortable middle class lifestyle. It has been my goal in life for as long as I can remember. But life has robbed me of that thus far first through hardship and then second by a wife who said she wanted kids then refused to have them afterwards.

So yeah. The second a woman I am with says something like that she has all of my fucking undivided attention immediately."
"I'm pretty sure I learned it from [Sapiens](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens) by Yuval Noah Harari. I can't recommend this book enough if your interested in human development. 

The way I understand it is that standing on two legs forces each leg to be stable in 3 direction: front, back, and right or left depending on the leg. They rely on the other leg for stability in the opposite direction. On four the legs are only responsible for 2; back and right for the right rear leg. This change caused our hips to become narrower in order to accommodate. The birth canal stayed in the same location while our skills actually increased in size( I'm not sure about the timeline of which change occurred first). If you ever watch other primates walk on two feet they appear bow legged because they are not as well adapted to it as humans. Since child has actually become more difficult for humans due to our evolution I would imagine it is more painful for humans at least compared to other primates who share similar hip architecture. I can't say compared to other animals. Many of them give birth children more fully developed so it would be hard to say. 

TL;DR Narrower hips provide more stability while walking on two legs but also make childbirth more painful.

"I'd say Moffat's biggest problem is that he doesn't world-build. A lot of the monsters or situations are interesting enough but are usually presented without any sort of context. Back when David Tennant was Doctor, under R T Davies, there'd always be these amazing wide shots and a few lines of dialogue about where in the universe they were and what year it was and just a little bit of context, and at the end the doctor would usually describe why the monster of the week did what it did and what exactly it was and where it was from and such. And then, throughout there'd be hints at the overarching series arc, like the Bad Wolf or Harold Saxon, which instilled a sense of mystery and continuity, which came to a head in the two-part finales. Little touches just made the whole thing feel more alive. 

Moffat's episodes just don't deliver the same sort of context or overarching plot. If there is a series arc, it'll either be shoved in your face but strangely never explored well, like last season's whole Hybrid thing, or the Silence, or never resolved satisfyingly, like literally anything to do with River Song, or the Silence.

They are most commonly used incorrectly when part of a compound subject or compound object.  To decide if it's right or not, strip it down to just the ""me"" or ""I"".  

You know that you wouldn't say ""What if me don't work out?"" You would say ""what if I don't work out?"" So, the compound subject is ""you and I.""  ""What if you and I don't work out?"" 

""Me and my brother went to the store."" No, because you wouldn't say ""Me went to the store."" ""My brother and I went to the store.""

You'll also see the same problem with he/him, she/her.  ""Her and her sister went to the store.""  No.  ""She and her sister went to the store."" "
"No one asked where Ray was that winter morning.  He had become somewhat of a town staple, the nice homeless man who strutted around town telling stories of the war and rejecting any handouts offered.  Ray was content living the hard life.  The town was content with letting him.  One of the super Mart's even got him a brand new Carr to push around, the one free thing Ray didn't turn down.

No one asked what Ray really wanted.  Everyone had assumed that he wanted the material.  You'd come up to him and offer him some change, and you'd stay to talk for a while after he said no.  Then, you'd wonder why he never took the change.  

No one asked if Ray wanted a friend.  If anyone did, they would find out that that's the only thing he ever wanted.  Everyone was content to chat for a while, but no one ever dug deeper.

No one asked what happened to Ray during the war.  

No one asked about the only friends Ray had, and how he lost them.

No one asked Ray about the horrors he saw, the innocents he lost.

No one asked Ray if he was fine last night.

No one asked, ever.  

And now, no one would ever ask anything."

I just had a thought, though. I think I've thought this before, but it's just been reinforced: I am sure she has the same thoughts about a different form of interaction. Like, she is sitting there thinking, ""I just wish he would [do X], because [X] is how I want to show him that I love him, and [X] is how I know he loves me.""

In my case, I'm fairly sure that is ""romance."" Still not sure what exactly that is, but I guess I can try to find out.

So wings and flight controls (ailerons) were already around. So they didn't invent the airplane from scratch. People have been trying to fly since the dawn of age! Also, there is some dispute as to if even the Wright Brothers were the first to invent the airplane. Going off of technicalities, the Wright's plane was launched into the air then it maintained flight. Some people claim a real airplane would power itself into flight!

"Oh awesome, I have a recent one to tell you all! My friend and I both worked as managers at McD's. I had been dealing with depression from my job, a very low income, and no hopes of going back to school for a career. If either myself or my boyfriend had tried, we wouldn't have had the funds to support ourselves. My friend was in university to become a surgeon. She came from a rich family. She honestly worked for extra spending money. Her boyfriend was about to go back to school as well and already had a high paying job. She had it pretty good and I was happy for her, we were all good friends.    
I eventually contacted an employment agency that with government funding helped people build their skills and work towards getting a better job. They didn't find you a job but they pushed you in the right direction and gave you the tools to succeed and the means to access jobs other people might not have known about. So I get hooked up with this sweet accounting administrator job, and I ask one of my bosses and my friend to be a positive reference. They both agreed they went over what they would say roughly, and I went in for the interview.    
I nailed it! Everyone was super impressed, and at the end of the day I got a call back saying I got the job. I was practically in tears. I wouldn't be living pay cheque to pay cheque anymore. I had doubled my income, salary office position, great benefits, vacation, you name it.    
On my second day, my employment consultant came to speak to both myself and my direct boss/supervisor. As my boss leaves the room, the consultant says ""Um, just so you know, you should probably not use your second reference."" And I'm like what? She said ""it... it was bad.""    
I sit down with my boss 2 months later and somehow the topic comes up. We went into a meeting room and closed the door and spoke about it and she asked me our relationship. I told her we were good friends, worked amazing shifts together, had each other's backs at work and always did a great job. She ended up saying a lot of nasty shit about me and doing a complete 180° mid interview. My boss said it was so unlike my other references, they completely disregarded it and she ended up calling my employment consultant upset and angry that my friend had done that to me.    
Needless to say, a month later I calmly asked her about the reference she gave, and she went on a huge rant about not wanting to be apart of my drama and that i had better not bother our boyfriends about this and if I contacted her again she would call the police.    
Psycho.      
       
TL;DR Asked friend to be a positive reference so I could get out of poverty, she back stabbed me but thankfully I got the job anyway."

He was the guy from the 4chan tendies stories come to life.

The plane thing happened because the client was in a foreign country with his mom and he wanted his dad to join them. His dad needed to visit an elderly relative in another U.S. state, so he couldn't go. The client impersonated him over the phone to the airline and asked them to change his ticket. They complied because he had all his dad's personal info. The dad only realized his son had done this when he got to the airport.

"Here's what I pulled from here: http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-464693.html


&gt; Native Montanan here. 
&gt; 
&gt; As samclem's linked NY Times story reflects, Montana had no fixed speed limit prior to 1974. The Feds imposed a 55 mph speed limit in 1974 (during the last ""energy crisis"") and told all states to adopt it. Since the Feds lacked (and still lack) the direct authority to tell states what their speed limit must be on any non-federal highways, they (the Feds) tied federal transportation dollars to adoption of the 55 mph speed limit and threatened to withhold those dollars froms states not toeing the line. Since Montana, like every other state, gets a huge chunk of their road maintenance money from federal transportation funds, they imposed the 55 mph speed limit.
&gt; 
&gt; The speed limit was treated with complete derision for a couple of reasons. First, expecting people to drive 55 on most of the state highways and interstates in Montana is a joke. These are mostly wide open, light traffic roads, and distances between towns is relatively far as compared to smaller states. NOBODY drives 55. Second, and more to the point, Montana has a bit of the ""Live Free Or Die"" spirit (with apologies for stealing the motto of New Hampshire) and there was a lot of resentment that the Feds would strong-arm the state into passing a law that was (a) unnecessary and (b) unwanted. 
&gt; 
&gt; So the legislature made the speed limit 55 (raised to 65 when allowed some years later) but then also imposed a penalty of $5 for violating it. Since the Feds' justification for passing the 55 mph law was not safety but fuel conservation, the Montana legislature made the penalty for exceeding the speed limit a fine for wasting a natural resource, not a moving violation, with the result that it had no effect on your insurance. (Montana did not use a ""points"" system for driving violations until the 1990s anyway.) 
&gt;

You could pay the ticket by cash or check and if you couldn't pay it, you were issued a ticket just like any other ticket and you could mail your five dollars in. If you didn't eventually pay it, you could be called to court in theory, but the truth is no one ever bothered to prosecute those tickets anyway. (But most everybody paid it; it was five freakin' bucks.)
&gt; 
&gt; In 1995, the federal government abolished the federal speed limit. Montana then decided that rather than enacting another numeric speed limit for the State, they would simply invoke the ""basic rule"" for driving, which requires that all vehicles be operated in a ""reasonable and prudent"" manner. (And yes, it was ""reasonable and prudent,"" not ""reasonable and proper"".) This was an attempt to hark back to the pre-1974 days, when rural ol' Montana had no speed limit. But what was marginally acceptable in 1974 was not realistic in 1995. Montana got a largely undeserved repuation as the ""Montanabahn"" where Hey! You can drive as fast as you want! The Montana Highway Patrol disliked the law due to a steep increase in speeding and in people being mouthy when pulled over (""You can't ticket me!"") and the federal government disliked it both as a precedent and over safety concerns and began rumbling again about limiting the state's access to federal transportation dollars. More importantly in the end, drivers disliked it because it didn't give you any clear notice of when you were breaking the law. (""Can I drive 70? 75? 80?"") 
&gt; 
&gt; In 1998, the Montana Supreme Court struck down the ""basic rule"" as unconstitutional as a legal basis for fining a driver for speeding. The case was brought by a plaintiff named Rudy Stanko, who was a well-known ""Freeman"" white-supremicist nut-job who was a perennial recreational litigant who finally hit a winner challenging the speed law. The Court held that ""reasonable and prudent"" was too vague to give a driver notice of what action broke the law, and therefore violated the due process clause of the Montana Constitution.
&gt; 
&gt; Montana then had NO speed limit until May of 1999, when the legislature set the speed limit back to 65. This time from late '98 to mid '99 was the only post-1974 period when Montana really didn't have any sort of speed limit, which wasn't that big of a deal because the Patrol just stopped ticketing for basic rule and stepped up ticketing for careless or reckless driving. 
&gt; 
&gt; The speed limit was later bumped up to the current 75 on interstates, 65 on secondary roads. And that's the whole saga."

"I had a terrible experience with a nice restaurant near my house.

Our guests were nice enough to pick up the tab, and included what they thought was a reasonable tip. After the bill is paid and we keep chatting, I eventually have to go to the bathroom. When I come back, there's a noticeable tension in the air.

Turns out while I was away the manager came to our table to ask if everything was alright with our meal, *saying he was worried something was wrong because our tip was so low*. My SO was mortified that he basically came out to essentially tell us we hadn't tipped enough, and our guests were incredibly embarrassed. They emptied their wallet to pay even more tip.

My SO stopped me from going back inside and telling off the manager for essentially coming out with his hat in his hand, saying she didn't want to make our guests feel worse.

All right. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right... and who is dead.
 
Vizzini:  But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you:  are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. 

Wesley:  You've made your decision then? 

Vizzini:  Not remotely. Because Iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. 

Wesley:  Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. 

Vizzini:  WAIT TILL I GET GOING! Where was I? 

Wesley:  Australia. 

Vizzini:  Yes, Australia. And you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. 

Wesley: You're just stalling now. 

Vizzini:  YOU'D LIKE TO THINK THAT, WOULDN'T YOU?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong, so you could've put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard, which means you must have studied, and in studying you must have learned that man is mortal, so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. 

Wesley:  You're trying to trick me into giving away something. It won't work. 

Vizzini:  IT HAS WORKED! YOU'VE GIVEN EVERYTHING AWAY! I KNOW WHERE THE POISON IS! 

Wesley:  Then make your choice.
 
Vizzini:  I will, and I choose-- What in the world can that be? 

Wesley:  What? Where? I don't see anything. 

Vizzini:  Well, I- I could have sworn I saw something. No matter.

Wesley:  What's so funny? 

Vizzini:  I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink. Me from my glass, and you from yours.

"The most recent one is last week. My Dad and Step Mom left town on a short vacation. My evil little step brother (just made 19) broke into our parents house. Shattering a window and breaking down locked interior doors. 

Him and two 13 year old boys stole over 100,000$ worth of jewelry, designer purses, shoes, etc. 

(Our dad is wealthy and owns a car lot)
And what's worse. My brother stole all the keys to every car. 


Irreplaceable keys to things like Lamborghinis, Saleen S7, and a Shelby ultimate aero. 

(Just 1 key replacement costs ballpark of 12,000$) 

My brother is such a POS it was clearly him. The detectives picked him and his 2 accomplices up within a few days. 

FOLLOW UP : some items have been recovered. Including all the keys thank goodness. 

Also the kids squeeled about who they sold various things to. 

One drug dealer gave my brother an oz of weed (300$ tops) 
For a $7000 purse and a pair of $4000 Valentino high heels. 

TLDR:
My brother robbed our parents house and he's not even on hard drugs. Sold thousands of dollars worth of goods for pennies on the dollar, denies it all even after being caught by detectives and tattled on by loser friends.

"Okay, so there was a guy who was my friend. We hung out and stuff. Played tabletop games. He came over to my place a couple times with some other friends. All the usual stuff. This went on for about...six months? I thought we were god friends during that time.

Haha, no. I guess he had a chip in his shoulder about me from day one. One day, I get a nice, long, expletive laced email explaining in no uncertain terms that they had, to sum it up, been more then patient with me (they even said that they were still trying to be nice?) that we were not friends, that I was a bad person, and that we shouldn't talk anymore. He ended the email with 'I await your reply'.

Yeah. I had a nervous breakdown and a half, cried a bit, agonized over what I could have done better. Never replied, though. Some real friends of mine helped me through it, and a week later I was back on my feet.

Then, nearly four weeks later, after not a single word from them, I get another email. All it said was 'I don't feel the need to hold a grudge'.

If I had been sad before, I was furious now. I spent the next week wondering how worth it it would be to knock them down a flight of stairs. However, I didn't respond in any way, face to face or email.

I still haven't talked to him. And I never will. He can die alone and friendless for all I care.

**TL;DR: If a 'friend' turns out to hate you, it isn't worth crying over. You haven't lost anything. In fact, you've gotten rid of some trash in your life.**

Edit: Forgot to add this. This technically wasn't out of the blue; there were a few instances where this guy would flash that maybe he didn't like me. Mainly by always sending me emails telling me how he really felt and never saying it to my face. The day in particular we got into a fight-playing DND, he kept looking up facts on the monster they were fighting and sharing them loudly, despite me repeatedly telling him not to (all you DND players know the DM needs some level of authority). He then held up the game for about five minutes insisting I was a wrong about a monster fact. Turned out to be a glitch with the website; he didn't apologize, though. Later that day I got the email that I mentioned originally,"

Years later, the dragon statue emerged, scaring the town into thinking they had some form of mini Loch Ness monster living in their lake.

Now it's seen as this great movie because of its direction, themes, even the acting is decent.

The detail that is seen in the direction isn't evident in many folks today - maybe David Fincher and other really too directors. Technologically it was quite ahead of its time too. It's use of deep focus (having every part of the shot in focus) has always been the thing that caught my eye.

"And I find the idea we should just throw all our tradition in the bin in the name of modernism pretty narrow-minded as well. One of my favourite quotes by a British politician is this:

&gt;There is no country at the present moment that exists under the same circumstances and under the same conditions as the people of this realm. You have an ancient, powerful, and richly endowed Church, and perfect religious liberty. You have unbroken order and complete freedom. You have landed estates as large as the Romans, combined with a commercial enterprise such as Carthage and Venice united never equalled. And you must remember that this peculiar country, with these strong contrasts, is not governed by force. It is governed by a most singular series of traditionary influences, which generation after generation cherishes and preserves, because it knows that they embalm custom and represent law. And with this you have created the greatest empire of modern times. You have amassed a capital of fabulous amount. You have devised and sustained a system of credit still more marvellous, and you have established a scheme so vast and complicated of labour and industry that the history of the world affords no parallel to it. And these mighty creations are out of all proportion to the essential and indigenous elements and resources of the country. If you destroy that state of society, remember this: England cannot begin again

Yes we're a monarchy rather than a republic, yes we have traditions that foreigners might find a bit strange but in the end the UK (and I believe Disraeli was using ""England"" to refer to the UK as was common at the time) is the 5^th largest economy in the world, one of the largest exporters of culture and to be honest, a bloody good place to live. Why should we should tear all that up with radical reforms to feel more ""modern"" is beyond me.

"By all accounts, Rodger was incredibly isolated. He was largely unempathetic and failed to connect with others/maintain any social relationships. He didn't seem like the kind of guy who understood how to share himself honestly or empathize with others. His solitude slowly eroded what little understanding he *did* have of other people. If you never spend time with anyone, you only see others' surface. Soon, that was all that he could see.

In the end, he objectified people. He reduced them to their Facebook posts, their names, their labels. He didn't see other people as real, he saw them as living caricatures - the ones fed to him through the internet and other mass media. Meanwhile, Rodgers was deeply emotionally hurt, grappling with feelings of inadequacy and failure. He had no way of developing social relationships and no mechanism for emotional release. 


With no way to escape self-loathing, Rodger shut down emotionally. He became fully psychopathic in his ideology and took on the most convenient argument. He didn't blame only women, he blamed successful men (""alpha"" males), and society as a whole. Internally, he was grappling between suicide and mass murder. Unfortunately for his victims, he chose the latter.


I don't think Rodger's mindset is uncommon. Especially in an age where convincing arguments are commonplace, blaming your personal failure on everything from Blacks to Donald Trump to lawyers. We are in an age where people are, ironically, more emotionally isolated than ever. We are more unable to share our feelings in a meaningful way (instead of just shitposting) and more unable to even *identify* our feelings behind a wave of copypasta and memes. 


It's pretty much the same reason why young dudes go and sign up with terrorist organizations.

"The thing is that ISIS puts the West in a situation where there are no winning moves. If we start to persecute Muslims, more Muslims could turn to them. If we don't make strong actions to ensure security of citizens from the single most problematic and violent ideology on the planet, the attacks are going to get bigger and easier for them, and the native population will get seriously hateful against all the Muslims, which is something you can't control at all.

And there is one more thing I want to say. Of course getting more people rallied to their cause is their goal. But just because they want us to be wary of Muslims doesn't mean its not the best possible move. There is a thing in chess called ""a forced move"": the opponent wants you to do it, but its also objectively best thing to do in that situation.

This ""just do opposite of what terrorists want"" approach a lot of people are proposing is getting funny, really. When an attack happens, everyone goes ""we can't let terrorists change us, we must be even more friendly and progressive in spite because that's what they don't want us to be!"" But at this point one could very well ask the following question: could this be exactly what they want? After all, it would make more attacks even easier for them. And all the world leaders are repeating the ""they won't divide us!"" message every time this happens, maybe if they truly wanted different results, they would have tried different methods. But they keep doing the same thing. So maybe its because they like the reactions they get. 

You can get arbitrarily deep into the ""what do they actually want"" problem. This ""circular"" paradox of not playing into the opponents hands with our limited knowledge is fucking us over. The solution is simple - just take a bit of inspiration from Alexander and the Gordian knot. Don't give a fuck about what they want at all. Give a fuck about what WE want."

They seem like not the same thing.

People don't know how hard it is to get back on your feet.  He worked incredibly hard once he had the chance.  He left one morning at 5am to walk to the post office and mail himself proof of address.  He used that to apply for food stamps.  In the meantime he was volunteering at a church for 12 hours every week, waiting in lines for hours for food/clothes donations.  Obviously I gave him what I could, but he was desperate to be self sufficient and pay his way.  I woke up so many times to find half of his food donations split up on my kitchen table, for me.  I made him take them when he left the first time.  I did eat some of the bomb ass Panera bread though, I was surprised at the quality of the donations.  Gave me hope that people actually cared, not just throwing in expired cans of prunes and stale bread or whatever.

From working so hard, the church donated a bike to him.  I couldn't give him rides all the time because of work.  Then he'd wait for up to 8 hours at the Job center, most times to be told they had nothing, go home.  It blew my mind to watch him bust his ass so hard.  I knew I'd made the right choice.  He told me he loved me, that I saved his life, that we're brothers.  He's only a few years younger than me.  And we are.  We're friends, he just so happened to be homeless when we met.

Definitely one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life.

They're almost always women only events. Birth can be a traumatic experience and in general women aren't encouraged to talk about their experiences, especially around men, but being somewhere that is all women and very birth focused these women feel comfortable sharing their stories. I've known some husbands of friends who get upset that they don't get to be a part of the shower (their wives want a women only shower btw), but I just think these men don't understand that it is one of the very few places that other women feel safe talking to each other about their pregnancy and birthing experiences.

"I will tell you a story.

In the 1980's my country was ruled by a military regime headed by a general called Ibrahim Babangida (IBB); a very brilliant and charismatic guy but ruthless and totally amoral. For some reason Mummar Ghadaffi of Libya got it into his head that IBB and Nigeria was a continental competitor and did everything to score points in this game of one-upmanship. So unheralded by the press, there existed a rivalry and cold war between the leaders of both nations.

Enter the Nigerian ""prince"". Not actually..., but the predecessor of the fake half assed variety you find on the internet today. These people were HARD CORE scammers and one group led by a 30 something charismatic leader named Fred Ajudua came up with a plan. They put together some documents, and armed with a credible back-story that gave them fake identities as middle level Army officers, approached  intermediaries who  eventually set up a meeting with Ghadaffi himself in Libya. They sold a plan to Ghadaffi to overthrow the Nigerian junta and put in place a government headed by their group which of course would be less hostile to Libyan interests and aspirations- *much less hostile* - as in vassal state level of cooperation. But to successfully remove an entrenched dictator like IBB many arrangements had to be made. Weapons had to be purchased and key people bribed to look the other way. yada yada.
Ghadaffi  bought the idea and signed off the required amount- in the millions of dollars. 

Stage one complete. But there was a problem.

Did I mention IBB was a really bad motherfucker? What would happen when his intelligence agents got wind of the plot? Fake or not, it would not bode well for anyone involved.
 Well these guys were no fools and had a plan to deal with that too. They flew back to Nigeria and arranged an audience with the president where they **confessed to everything** and even presented the funds wired to them as evidence of loyalty. The president is so impressed with them that he not only allows them keep the money but also *makes them a gift* a gift of his own for pulling one over his arch-rival.

If that is not bad ass then redefine the term.

"&gt;It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.

"&gt; When people bring up the attack helicopter meme, I've found that it's actually leaning more transphobic. Especially since people will use it when people are talking about transgender or genderfluid people.

This. Jesus.

Trans people, I've found, are one of the last groups left who it's completely acceptable to be bigoted towards. Trans people are at the level now that gay people were ten or fifteen years ago. We view them as broad, flamboyant stereotypes and openly talk about how they're mentally ill or perverted or delusional. It's a crying shame we have to keep relearning how to let people live their own fucking lives.

"Can confirm. Wish I had an underwater camera to prove it. Anyways, I snorkeled once off the coast of a small island in the Bahamas. Big reef, pink sands, very pretty.

Came across a lobster that was literally the size of a Volkswagen bus. Maybe even bigger, since it was hiding under a piece of the reef that was 20 or 30 feet down. His antenna things must have been twice as long as me.

"&gt;Well it's no secret the only reason Hillary isn't in jail is because she has the name Clinton protecting her. 

Bull fucking shit. Right off the bat you start by treating a subjective opinion like it's a commonly accepted fact.  

&gt;You have to be horribly naive to think otherwise.

And here's where you preempt any challenge to your assertion by calling everyone who disagrees with you naive. This, unsurprisingly, is how most conspiracy theorists deal with detractors and critics. So congrats, you're in good company. 

&gt;I've read countless stories of people getting 20+ years in jail for mishandling classified information

I've heard stories of Bigfoot molesting people's pets, but that doesn't matter. Here you're making another assumption, that she mishandled classified information. So far there is zero evidence to suggest such a thing. There have been emails that were retroactively classified and emails that were sensitive, but so far nothing has shown that Clinton knowingly mishandled classified information. And if you want to talk about naivety, how about being so naive as to think the Secretary of State, regardless of their name, would be treated the same way that a low level peon who leaked or mishandled classified information would be treated. 

&gt;let alone tampering with it, and deleting the evidence when it's requested.

More bullshit unfounded accusations. She deleted her personal emails. **What kills me is you people regularly think she's clever and powerful enough to rig elections, literally get away with murder as some of you believe, circumvent FOIA requests, launder money through the Clinton Foundation, etc... but yet she couldn't manage to properly delete her emails.** How the hell does that work? If I had the power and the resources backing me to rig state primaries, you'd think I could afford someone who's taken Computer Science 101. But weirdly, that doesn't strike you as odd. And if you took the time to research your claim, you would find that Clinton has been to most vocal advocate for releasing all her emails since this became an issue. 

But like I said in my original comment, there is nothing that can be said to change any of your minds. You've made your decision and god help anyone who disagrees with you.

"Too many years of violence. I was the last person in the family to finally stop talking to her. She was the most bitter and hateful person I've ever met.

When I was growing up she would refuse to buy groceries or take care of herself. She would prevent me from seeing other family members. She would keep me from sleeping almost every single night. The thing that eventually sealed the deal was when a really close friend of mine died suddenly. She had been giving me the silent treatment and when I finally got through to her and told her what happened, she only said, ""Oh."" then changed the subject entirely.

The fact that you have to add ""or something"" gets to the fact that it's often *not* obvious what they mean, even to them. People have a vague concept of ""icky bad stuff that evil corporations put in everything"" but don't really know what the actual chemicals are or why those chemicals are supposedly a problem.

Even limiting it to ""synthetic chemicals"" isn't that useful because there are no common chemical properties that are due to them being man made. You're still leaning on some  narrower category that the reader is left to fill in with implicit beliefs.

The reason to use precise language is to clarify your thinking.

Take care of you health. If you fuck up now it's going to be a long long road until the sweet release of death.

Therefore be nice to everyone, even if they can't help you at all. Work on your people skills. Appreciate those around you who care about you. (like your parents or siblings)

"Basically the TLDR argument is, God initially created the world perfectly with the condition we obey one rule. Adam and Eve broke that rule and thus allowed corruption/sin to entire our world. Basically the first man fucked it up not only for humans, but for nature as well. So the argument with this case is, we can chose to sin or act morally and we got ourselves into this shithole and can only blame ourselves. So blame lies with that fucking perverted freak. If you want God to have prevented it, you also need to take away the concept of free will/a soul (free will is a waaaay bigger debate in and of itself.)"

"I love the term that Nintendo and/or Retro Studios gave it: an FPA, first person action/adventure. There's plenty of enemies to shoot sure, but that's not the main gameplay mechanic. The true spirit of Metroid is all about exploration, finding new items to not only become more powerful, but also find and reach new places. I loved how they managed to translate that feeling from a historically 2D franchise into 3D. Oh sure, concessions had to be made, but if you ask me, there's isn't one best Metroid game of all. There's two. Super Metroid for 2D, Metroid Prime for 3D. Prime is just too different yet too good to just blanket say one of the two is better than the other IMO. Typically Super Metroid would get the top spot for a lot of fans, but for me, they share first place."

"This is going to make me sound callous.

There was a young man at my high school who had a reputation for being an incredibly unpleasant individual. While I never personally suffered at his hands, there were stories upon stories of his atrocious behavior, many of which included sexual assault, theft, destruction of property, and even a few rumors of attempted murder. He was never charged with any of these crimes - at least, not that I know of - but this was allegedly only because nobody ever reported them in an official capacity.

Late one evening, the fellow choked to death on his own vomit.

Some people claimed that he'd been incredibly drunk, while others said that he'd overdosed on some drug or another. Whatever the cause, the end result was his death... and the reaction that it prompted was somewhat confusing. For example, girls who had previously spoken of being attacked by the young man gathered in groups to hug one another and cry. People wailed about how much they would miss him, or about what a great guy he had been, as though all of his prior atrocities had somehow been wiped clean with his passing.

I certainly didn't think that the fellow deserved to die, of course, but I also couldn't understand why everyone was so willing to forget the things that he'd done.

Later that same year, a rather popular girl died of an apparent suicide. I say ""apparent"" because it was eventually suggested (by a so-called ""close friend"") that she had been experimenting with autoerotic asphyxiation. The reaction to her death was fairly similar to the one brought on by the death of the delinquent, with one surprising exception: In her case - and again, this was a girl whom many people claimed to adore - malicious whispers and rumors were almost as common as tears.

Once again, I didn't really understand that.

"The Lac Mégantic rail [disaster] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac-Mégantic_rail_disaster).    

""MMA's operating plan was to leave the train parked on the main line, unattended, with an unlocked locomotive cab, alongside a public highway where it was accessible to the general public, with no additional protection.""
What the worst that could happened ?  A fire.
 
""We shut down the engine before fighting the fire. Our protocol calls for us to shut down an engine because it is the only way to stop the fuel from circulating into the fire.""
""the diesel engine was shut down, thereby disabling the compressor powering the air brakes, which allowed the train to roll downhill from Nantes into Lac-Mégantic once the air pressure dropped in the reservoirs on the cars"" 
What the worst thing that can happened after that ?  

A derailement, lots of explosions and a fire that killed 47 people.   More than 30 building were destroyed and 36 had to be demolished.

100x larger wouldn't make much difference in the size of them in that, for the same volume of semen, you'd have 3 Million spermatozoa in the palm of your hand.

One proceeds to pull out a gun, and one of my friends freaked and gasped way too loud, and the four guys looked over at us.  Two guys continued on their way, but two started walking towards us... so we took off in the opposite direction.  They followed us, and started chasing us.  We all fled into the woods and ran until we got to a neighborhood and hid under some guy's deck for what felt like an hour.  They chased us all the way through the woods.  They were probably just some punks about to rob some apartments, and they thought it would be fun to mess with the high kids... But we were positive at the time that they were going to murder us."

"I grew up in the mountains. I have always felt really comfortable in the woods and plains. It feels like home to me. 

When I was 18 years old, freshly graduated from high school, I took my best friend on a small hike behind my Grandma's house. Although she didn't have a lot of property herself, her lot backed up onto a pretty decent size of land that was her neighbors. The house was on the side of a mountain, so directly behind her it was a steep rocky slide. So steep in fact that we opted to scoot on our asses for a good portion of the descent. 
At the bottom was a really beautiful stream, completely shaded by granite rock faces and dense trees. You couldn't even see my Grandma's house from the bottom, even though you weren't that far away. 
We began walking upstream, talking and laughing and enjoying the lush green and browns of the mountains. About 1/4 mile upstream from the house, we were elated to find a large patch of wild raspberries. 
After snacking on them for a little bit, we turned a corner as the stream winded uphill a little. About 10 feet across the stream, there was a nice sunny patch of grass. In the middle of the grass I saw a reclining light brown figure. It took my brain a second to figure out what I was looking at because this thing was laying on its back, sleeping. It twitched its hind leg, and I saw the magnitude of its back paw. A fucking bear. A huge fucking bear. Sleeping on its back. We were surrounded by boulders and very steep grassy hillside, far enough away from the house that no one could hear us. 
All I said was ""bear,"" in my quietest and sternest voice and we abruptly turned around and walked as quietly and quickly as we could. I was so afraid to look back to see the bear stalking us. We walked the entire way back in complete silence.

I have more bear stories if anyone wants more. "

"TMV is one of my favorite bands but their opening set for RHCP here in Philly was awful. They played for over an hour and only played two recognizable songs. The rest was a jam that just didn't flow at all.

"This is my biggest problem with Libertarians. The argument that 'why should the government get any of my hard earned money in taxes?'. Because you live in a society and financial system that only exists because we all agree it does. If you earn all your money on the stock market for example, that only exists as a concept because we all contribute to a society that allows such a structure to exist. If you own a business then you use the infrastructure and the currency to run that business. None of this shit exists in isolation. You earned money because society exists to determine what money is worth. There's a massive network of stuff that needs to be there for all of that system to hold together. You're paying for the privilege of participating in that system. And yes, it's mandatory. So what?"

"Hi, it's not common for me to come across a fellow Singaporean redditor, but I feel this needs to be said. I'm Singaporean as well, and gay, so it definitely caught my attention when I saw your comment.  I have faced homophobia from the Singapore Muslim community, from the wear white campaign, to the numerous homophobic comments written by Singaporean muslim netizens, to overhearing homophobic shit said by some muslim people in my life. I just need to ask you, where, do you as a muslim, stand on the issue of gay rights? Cos if you disagree with gay rights as per your religious beliefs, then I find it incredibly disingenuous of you to come here to offer sympathy to a community who has been a victim of a hate crime, while still holding personal beliefs that said community deserve to be treated as second class citizens, not deserving of marriage rights, minority protection rights and rights to fair and accurate media representation, all of which are absent in Singapore. If you are one of the muslims who actually support gay rights, then please accept my apology. If not, then you are part of the problem."

So we drive there and this old, probably almost dead man, lies on his bed saying ""Ai, ai, ai, ai, it hurts, it hurts"" over and over again. We try to talk to him to figure out whats wrong when I notice that he is holding his junk which looks a bit too big. We pull down his pants and... Well.. the BIGGEST BALLS I have ever seen in my life. He had an infection and his balls were swollen to the size of two apples. One a bit bigger then the other, but both filled with purulence.

She and I had different food preferences and once she started to cry when my parents took us to the local burger joint. I didn't realize this was happening until I ordered a cheeseburger and she freaked out. Turns out she's lactose intolerant and but was afraid my parents would tell hers that she didn't order the same meal as me. My folks were super cool and calmed her down while reassuring her that when she ate with us she could get whatever she wanted. 

Her parents also didn't believe that she was lactose intolerant and would frequently make milkshakes and she had to have one too.

"I'm an Asian-American male and I came to /r/AsianMasculinity looking to find some inspiration. Instead, all I found was white hatred left and right. That is not how you celebrate Asian masculinity.

The most recent thread on the front page in that subreddit is about revisionism of communism. The OP of that thread left some pretty nasty comments about how capitalism is ""the white man's"" way of oppressing every other race, ignoring the fact that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are clear examples of how capitalism on the eastern hemisphere can be successful.

The worst part is the usage of the term ""brothers and sisters"" in that subreddit, as if somehow using a term generally used by black activists will somehow unite all PoC against ""the white man."" Um, no. There can be some pretty nasty white racists out there, but racism comes in all flavors and from all directions. I've heard a black classmate say ""all Asian guys have small dicks haha"" just as I've heard an Asian friend say ""wow that slut looks like white trash, seriously, does she live in a trailer park too?""

The perpetuation of stereotypes lies more than just the ""dominant"" class having power over the others. It doesn't take a genius to realize that some Asian people have had the stereotype of hard-working, mature, and smart work in their favor when applying for certain jobs. If you want your race/ethnicity to be seen through non-stereotypical lens, you're going to have to work together in your community to combat it. Sometimes, you're going to have to burn past bridges in order to do so."

* 1970: Simon and Garfunkel, ""[Bridge Over Troubled Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_a46WJ1viA)"" -- absolute classic
* 1971: Three Dog Night, ""[Joy to the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf-d-Ka30EY)"" -- maybe not a classic, but a great song
* 1972: Roberta Flack, ""[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9jmusgMgro)"" -- heavy on the sentimentality, but still a good, solid song
* 1973: Tony Orlando and Dawn, ""[Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWn1Oj2V7Xw)"" -- definitely cheesy, but it holds up OK, and is still enjoyable
* 1974: Barbra Streisand, ""[The Way We Were](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBPQT2Ia8fU)"" -- not my cup of tea, soft rock-y and sentimental, but it's an OK song
* 1975: Captain &amp; Tennille, ""[Love Will Keep Us Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QNEf9oGw8o)"" -- nothing wrong with this song, it's dated but fun

The argument was about which is faster the toaster oven, or full sized oven.

Then when the third roommate came downstairs, he was like this argument is ridiculous the microwave would be fastest. Even though this was technically true we found that disgusting and agreed that cooking method didn't count. But then he countered with the fact that hot dogs were not high end cuisine so who cares how you cook it.

I countered that with, because its low end cuisine we want to cook it in a way that tastes best. This is where we came to the conclusion that the method stated in the above comment would be the best way, with the exception of grilling it.

But the original roommate who was cooking hot dogs in the full sized oven made the point that this was too much effort he wanted a quick lazy way to cook hot dogs, and then the debate continued from square one."

To me it only makes it more impressive.  That's why I despise the film *Gandhi* and every other adulatingly hagiographic biopic.  The real Mohandas Gandhi was a complex, often conflicted, fascinating person who went through a lot of personal growth on his way to becoming Father of the Indian Nation (for example, IIRC he was only seriously racist in his early years).  He was very much a human being, with all the flaws and little hypocrisies that come with it, and I'd love to see a movie about what that guy managed to achieve in spite of all that.  What we got was a movie about St. Gandhi the Infallible, whose only arc is starting out perfect and getting even more perfecter as it goes on.  When he leads his people to freedom it's a foregone conclusion, which is why that movie is so fundamentally boring to me."

I'd really like to help my son be as successful as he can possibly be, and keep him from being the latest victim of a gang shooting gone bad, or a ""I-was-in-fear-of-my-life"" police event, or from irrevocably injuring himself with drugs or prison life (he thinks he's hard, but from personal experience, *real* criminals and gangstas would eat him for breakfast).  All of these things are *no bueno*.

To all of the judgmental folks who go immediately from zero to Church Lady on me in seconds flat, who are giving their LCSW a workout to shame or psychoanalyse me over the internet, (a) order a piping hot Bag of Dicks, on me, and (b) I pray that you *never* experience this hell and struggle."

But especially in summer and if you live in a more rural area/are ar a cottage I don't think it's that unusual? Skinny dipping too, super common. But also note that saunas usually have an adjoining changing room area, so a lot of people (esp in an unfamiliar sauna) will just disrobe there, so no need to stroll around naked.

"I work at Subway so I'll give some pointers.

Make sure you know what you want beforehand, you can stand away from the line and look at what we have before ordering, so do so if necessary.

Ordering is easy, we only need a few pieces of information. When you start your order, say the bread and what length you want, then say the kind of sandwich (BMT, Club, ect,.) and you can say what cheese you want right away or wait to be asked. 

Next we need to know if you want it toasted, know that if it's steak or any kind of chicken, it HAS to be heated so if you don't want it toasted, inform your sandwich artist (yes that's what we're called...) after ordering the meat so they can throw it in the microwave.

After that it's down to vegi's, just say what you want and make sure you're talking loud enough to be heard. Most people like to use an inside voice, please speak up. If the glass wasn't enough to make it hard to hear you, the several ovens and other workers and customers all around make it even harder. 

If you want lettuce or spinach, say that first when you get to vegi's, followed by tomato and/or cucumber if you want those. It's easier to put them on this way and makes it less messy.

If you want a little mayo, don't say ""light mayo"" because then we have to ask ""do you mean lite mayo or mayo lightly?"" it's not a problem but if you got anxiety you probs dont wanna be answering more questions than necessary.

TLDR; If you wanna order easily at subway know your bread/length/cheese/if toasted/vegi's/sauces and just answer as prompted."

"I was at a SoccerEx conference as a journalist about ten years ago and was milling about looking for people to interview. Then I saw former England captain and Eighties legend Bryan Robson. 

The thing was, I was a bit hungover and had the shits after late-night street food and at this point my guts were churning. I had really bad visions of being mid conversation with Robson and having to run off or, worse, shitting myself in front of him. So I sensibly decided to find a loo first and then catch up with him after. 

I found the nearest toilet, just in time. I won’t go into details but it was like someone had filled a old-fashioned blunderbuss with lentil dahl and fired away. A big stink and over half a loo roll later I flushed and walked out and there in the bathroom waiting to use the cubicle was Bryan Robson. 

Out eyes briefly met as I scuttled to sink, and as I was there washing my hands I heard him from the cubicle, “Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, that is not right…” Then started coughing. 

After that I was just too embarrassed to go up to him, so had to lie and tell my editor that he’d refused to talk to me. 

At least now though, I can now say I once made one of football’s hardmen cry.

"For very similar reasons, when our mother passed away year and a half ago, me and my sisters basically cut off from our extended family because of the possibility of endless 'how are you coping?' 'I hope you're doing allright' 'how can I help?'

What they never understood that we were there the whole two years as Mom's health went downhill. We saw the end coming at least six months before the fact - so by the time it happened, we already were almost stone cold used to the idea. I did not cry at her funeral because of that, and went to work the next day anyway.

"Copying from another thread I wrote this in.

It was my freshman year, first water polo tournament ever. I got my period for the first time before my game and couldn't figure out how to get a tampon in. Like, you want me to stick stuff up there?? Hell no.

My mom was hours away and her phone was dead and my sister was out of the country. I hid in my hotel room's bathroom crying in anger and pain, and I thought my roommate, my best friend at the time, sympathized with me. She was consoling me and saying everything was going to be all right. So I told her to go ahead and tell the rest of the team I was sick and that I would catch a ride to the high school we were playing at with another parent, and she went on her merry way.

After I managed to get a tampon in, I showed up about half an hour late to my team warming up and discovered that my supposed 'best friend' had told the entire team (~20 or so teenage girls, freshman to senior) and my twenty-five year old male coach that I couldn't get a tampon in and I was crying in the bathroom. Bad enough, right?

Nope, a few weeks later at the lunch table she brings it up to the rest of my friends and laughs about it. About the fact that I was scared about my period and couldn't get a tampon in.

"When I was in Iraq, every time I tried to call home, he would tell me he couldn't talk. He blamed it on the time difference. If I stayed up into the wee hours to call at a convenient time for him, he would be too busy to talk. When I asked to talk to the kids, they were always too busy. He never sent letters or packages or even emails. Occasionally I got brief excuses before he got off the phone, but that was it. I bought them all. 

Less than six months after getting back, I was sent to an army school to change jobs. I had 6 years in, a deployment, and I was back under drill sergeants, being controlled and screamed at 24/7 for four months. During that time, I called every day. He answered the phone twice. Both calls were less than 5 minutes long, and only once did I get to talk to my kids. Gradually, I learned through reluctant family and friends that the kids were staying with his parents, and he was off doing ""whatever"". 

When I finished the school, my mom came down for my graduation, and we drove back together, doing some sightseeing on the way. One evening, walking on the beach and looking for shells, it occurred to me that I would rather have gone back to the drill sergeants, or even back to the war zone, than go home to lay in bed next to him. I missed the kids so much, and I wanted them back...but every time I thought of him, there was a sick sense of dread in my stomach. It was all wrong. 

I got back to our hotel, and called him. I was trying to convince myself that I was wrong. I loved him. He loved me. Things were rough, but we would be ok. He answered the phone. I cried, and told him I was worried about us. That I wanted to do the right thing for our family and our kids. ""Then you should have just died in Iraq"", he said. 

The funny thing is, my mom snapped a picture of me that evening, walking on the beach and looking thoughtful. She loved it. It's a great picture, artistically. She frames it in a shadow box with some of the shells we found. She doesn't know that every time I see it, I remember the tension in my body, and the pit in my stomach, as my marriage collapsed under the weight of my work. "

"When we would all go out to family outings, my cousin's cousins would often come along. When we would go to water parks, their parents would make them strip and change in public. This wouldn't have been weird if the kids were like 3-5 years old, but they did this to them up until the age of 12 or so. An age where they were mature enough to know modesty, and you could see how humiliated they were."

"Orion is great at this kind of stuff. Above I said NASA could have a working, safe version in 10-20 years, but realistically most of that time is for ""safe"", not ""working"". From Wikipedia:

&gt;Freeman Dyson, group leader on the project, estimated back in the 1960s that with conventional nuclear weapons each launch would statistically cause on average between 0.1 and 1 fatal cancers from the fallout.^[[28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)#cite_note-disturbing-28)] That estimate is based on [no threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_no-threshold_model) model assumptions, a method often used in estimates of statistical deaths from other industrial activities.

This is totally unacceptable for routine missions or even a manned deep space mission, but fuck 'em if it's the apocalypse. Then, on top of that, the largest Orion design could literally lift an entire city, which makes it even better for this type of thing. Possibly my favorite part of that wikipedia article is:

&gt;Danger to human life was not a reason given for shelving the project. The reasons included [...] the fact that no-one in the U.S. government could think of any reason to put thousands of tons of payload into orbit [...]

"Both are right, at least from a linguistic perspective. 

There are a quite a few arguments about what makes it what it is. Some people will say that since the ""g"" stands for ""Graphics"" then it should be pronounced the same way. This doesn't really line up with how many other acronyms are pronounced, however. Take ""jpeg"", for example. The ""p"" stands for ""Photographic"", however it isn't pronounced ""jay-feg"". 

Others will say that the creator's word determines the absolute truth. He says it's pronounced with a soft g as in ""germs"", so that's the way it goes. This doesn't really work, either. The only reason take him seriously is because they already agreed with him. If he comes out tomorrow and changes his mind, does the ""right"" way change? What if he changes it and says that the proper pronunciation is ""bananaWHOOPwhoop""? Would we suddenly say ""whelp, guess that's what it is!""?

Of course not. 

Truth is, only one thing determines proper pronunciation: Usage.

If one hominid makes a noise by pushing air through some vibrating flaps of meat and another hominid associates that noise with the same concept the first hominid was trying to convey, well that's wtf that noise means. Plain and simple. 

So in this case, both are right and both are wrong. And precisely none of it matters since most people will say ""gif"" aloud a grand total of six times over the course of their life. "

"I rented a room out in my house to a friend who happened to be my ex girl friend.  We started dating again shortly after and it went crazy, crazy fast, so I broke up with her.  Told her as long as she paid rent, she could continue living there.

Went fine for a couple months, then she quit paying.

So I had to evict her.

I go to court and file the notice, and then shortly after the pay or quit time expires, I go back to file the court date for the eviction.  Shortly there after I receive notice she filed for Bankruptcy, which protects her from eviction.

TL:DR

It cost me $2500 and took me 6 months to get her out of my house, all the time she was living their for free.

That's like asking if I'm afraid that a car is going to crash through my living room, or that my house will be struck by lightning, or that I'm going to be killed in a freak livestock incident. It's possible, but so unlikely that I don't bother wasting my time worrying about them.


I take reasonable precautions, like locking my front door and sometimes also locking the back door, and being careful when walking alone at night, but other than that I'm fine.


The Australian murder rate is pretty low (http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/02/05/national-murder-rate-hits-record-low) and studies from 2011 (http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/mr/21-40/mr23/04_homicide-2010-12.html) showed that only 11% of homicides were by people unknown to the victim.


That's gives me a chance of just over one in a million of being murdered by a stranger. I'm much more likely to be killed by heart disease from not exercising than by someone stabbing me when I'm jogging. I'm  more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner than somebody who's broken in to my house.


I'm much more likely to be killed by skin cancer, or a traffic accident, or a heart attack or breast cancer. I'd rather put my time and effort into preventing these."

"99 cent gas station pie or 1.29 for 3 apples and 2 dollar peanut butter? An apple with peanut butter is a better breakfast than a gas station pie.

You can be poor and still eat ok. A can of corn drained, a can of beans drained, 1 chicken breast cut into pieces, and 2 stalks of celery all cooked together with garlic and other seasonings makes enough food for a family of 4 and it's not bad for you. Cheap, too, if you buy things in bulk and freeze/store.

EDIT: For those who asked - I grew up shopping at Walmart and Aldi and Costco/Sams Club. I was 1 of 2 kids raised by a single mom making 30k/year with no child support or familial support. We did qualify for free lunches at school, which we sometimes ate, but much preferred to eat things brought from home. I really don't know how my mom did it, other than she bought in bulk and on sale and made everything homemade (once a month she would take a weekend and make huge batches of food that she'd freeze into portions to unthaw and cook/rewarm) and we never ate out. She was a bookkeeper, though (who finally went back to school and got her CPA this year, I'm so proud of her!!) so she's really good with money... it was really tight some months and we've slept in the car before when she was between jobs and out of savings, but we made it.

Also, the apples and peanut butter thing - Where I live apples are 1.29-1.49/lb for the cheaper gala apples. I've found that about 3 apples is a pound, which is where I got that estimate. A small-ish jar of cheap off-brand peanut butter is about $2. Cream of Wheat or oatmeal is another cheap breakfast, by the way. My mom would make us hot cereal in elementary school and set out a ""toppings bar"", which looking back was just her way of making a cheap breakfast look more exciting than it was!"

"My math teacher in high school was often called ""Jesus"" behind his back. He was tall, had brown hair and a beard like typical pictures of Jesus do, and was very eccentric. It was rumored that he flirted with girls in his class. He used to weld as a hobby and ride his bike everywhere. One year, some old lady ran him over while he was riding his bike and he was out of school for a few months.

Anyway, I was a punk and skipped class sometimes. I hated not understanding the material (probably would if I had gone to class, huh?) and even skipped the day of a test once. I never brought it up, but he knew. When he passed the tests back, I was super nervous. He called me up to the front while the class had free time. He told me that he called my dad and told him I'd missed the test, but he was making me an offer. If I went to a tutor he recommended once a week, I could use the next test's score to makeup the score for the one I missed. The catch was, if I told anyone, he'd act like he didn't know what I was talking about and fail me for that other test.

He was still weird as hell, but that deal got me a B on the next test. The B replaced my zero from the last test. Weirdest person ever, but looking back, he actually really helped me out. Wonder what he's up to now..."

"I will never forget the sass and sarcasm from Yennefer's letter in the books. [Copy and pasted from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/3h75fx/a_letter_from_yennefer/)

&gt;Some prior information: During the beginning of Blood of Elves (a book printed in 1995), Geralt and other witchers have little Ciri trained in Kaer Morrhen. Witnessing her Source abilities which are beyond her control and which may be harmful for her, they decide to invite Triss to Kaer Morhen in order to teach Ciri how to keep that power under control (sound familiar?). After a series of events and chapters, Triss decides a more experienced Sorceress would be needed for such a task. Geralt, whose past and awkward relationship with Yennefer caused him to disregard her in the first place, finally writes to Yennefer on this matter. And here we see her hilarious response:

*Dear friend…*

&gt;The witcher swore quietly, looking at the sharp, angular, even runes drawn with energetic sweeps of the pen, faultlessly reflecting the author’s mood. He felt once again the desire to try to bite his own backside in fury. When he was writing to the sorceress a month ago he had spent two nights in a row contemplating how best to begin. Finally, he had decided on “Dear friend.” Now he had his just deserts.

&gt;*Dear friend, your unexpected letter – which I received not quite three years after we last saw each other – has given me much joy. My joy is all the greater as various rumours have been circulating about your sudden and violent death. It is a good thing that you have decided to disclaim them by writing to me; it is a good thing, too, that you are doing so so soon. From your letter it appears that you have lived a peaceful, wonderfully boring life, devoid of all sensation. These days such a life is a real privilege, dear friend, and I am happy that you have managed to achieve it.*

&gt;*I was touched by the sudden concern which you deigned to show as to my health, dear friend. I hasten with the news that, yes, I now feel well; the period of indisposition is behind me, I have dealt with the difficulties, the description of which I shall not bore you with.
It worries and troubles me very much that the unexpected present you received from Fate brings you worries. Your supposition that this requires professional help is absolutely correct. Although your description of the difficulty – quite understandably – is enigmatic, I am sure I know the Source of the problem. And I agree with your opinion that the help of yet another magician is absolutely necessary. I feel honoured to be the second to whom you turn. What have I done to deserve to be so high on your list?*

&gt;*Rest assured, my dear friend; and if you had the intention of supplicating the help of additional magicians, abandon it because there is no need. I leave without delay, and go to the place which you indicated in an oblique yet, to me, understandable way. It goes without saying that I leave in absolute secrecy and with great caution. I will surmise the nature of the trouble on the spot and will do all that is in my power to calm the gushing source. I shall try, in so doing, not to appear any worse than other ladies to whom you have turned, are turning or usually turn with your supplications. I am, after all, your dear friend. Your valuable friendship is too important to me to disappoint you, dear friend.*

&gt;*Should you, in the next few years, wish to write to me, do not hesitate for a moment. Your letters invariably give me boundless pleasure.*

&gt;*Your friend Yennefer*

&gt;The letter smelled of lilac and gooseberries.

"This is something similarly minded parents can actually do in Japanese. They pick from obscure kanji readings or just make up their own to create a name that is written one way but pronounced another. Here are some from a site devoted to strange names:

"It absolutely should.  I've talked to so many friends over the years (male and female) who, after a few years of marriage, find their partner not interested in sex any more.  Usually it's that one partner doesn't think they are attractive any more due to depression, medical problems, etc. So they reject their spouse's advances.  It takes a huge toll on the self-confidence of the rejected partner who starts to think it's about them.  They love everything else about their relationship, but they aren't getting something they desire from the one person who society tells them they are supposed to get it from.

If one partner is unable or unwilling to have sex, for most couples the only option is divorce or some form of cheating.  But if you love your partner and everything about the relationship EXCEPT the sex, why wouldn't you find a way to supplement it besides sneaking a wank in the shower?  "

He came home all despondent because he had scored 100. Dude. That's GOOD. Why would you be sad about that!?

"It's a bit deceptive.  Men do not pretty up for the camera.  Women do a lot of work to look good.  I'll take the example of the articles floating around comparing models and actresses with and without makeup.  Many are starkly contrasting in what a man would consider attractive.  A woman may look like a bombshell gussied up but quite plain and sometimes kind of unattractive without anything.  The power of makeup is quite awe inspiring sometimes.  We also have to realize that men see women in movies, tv, magazines, etc. always with makeup.  That creates our normal, so it would lead the the idea that the continuation of the use of makeup would maintain that normal.  On the flip side, men almost never use makeup, but again in movies, tv, magazines, etc. there is often moderate use of makeup to enhance their appearance.  In normal life men do none of this.

As well, we take pictures differently.  Women are far more careful about their pictures and what they actually present.  The one picture online might have been the best of 300 pictures she took to get that just right look.  Men don't really care and just upload whatever crap photos they have lying around.  They upload some camping trip photo where they haven't bathed in week and are just a ragged mess, and they just don't care.  So, there's a huge disparity in the quality of photo too.

Both of these alone highlight the ease at which the scales are offset.  Frankly, I would think attractiveness for men would be worse, like 5%, maybe 10% at best just because of how little we do to actually look attractive, at least in the form that is presented in media.  Women are vastly more in line with media, obsessively so, that they just happen to fit well into the bell curve."

"Some new information I'm seeing on NBC:

Mateen called 911 just before the shooting to alert police and pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. 

Word is now he had a Class G firearms license as a security guard, which means he went through at least 28 hours of classroom instruction and qualified on the range. ~~He was on at least one terrorism watch list for radical ties,~~ (see my edit below for confirmed info.) and yet still passed background checks to become a security guard and get two different licenses, along with the semiautomatic AR15 and handgun he used.

What we have here is a fundamental failure of the privacy invasions foisted on us. We looked at this guy, had him under watch for being a radical, and yet our agencies did not communicate in ways that would have prevented this.

This is not a gun problem, this is a problem of communication and lack of action to combat radical jihadists.

Edit: ISIS has claimed responsibility. Not that that means much, they'd claim responsibility if a dog bit a Christian. 

Governor Rick Scott has called for a moment of silence at 6pm Eastern time, in mourning of the lives lost.

All Orlando PD Officers and Sheriff Deputies involved in the firefight have been relieved of duty, pending investigation, per standard practice.

FBI confirms Mateen was investigated twice by the FBI, in 2013 and 2014, for ties to radical Islamists. Both investigations found minimal threat *at the time.* 

FBI confirms Mateen made a 911 call during events, making pro-Islamic State remarks.

ATF confirms Mateen was *not* a prohibited person, and was legally allowed to purchase the firearms within the last few days."

"[Over 80 percent of divorces are filed by women.](http://www.divorcesource.com/blog/why-women-file-80-percent-of-divorces/) This is an incredible number. As between two groups of otherwise equal participants, what would explain a 4 to 1 difference? 

It's that there are a lot of incentives for ladies to file. Monetary incentives and custody. Many modern dad spends as much time with the children as mom, but judges and laws come from a different era. 

How do we know women have these advantages? Why else would they be filing for divorce at such an incredibly higher rate? I could more cynically suggest that women ""don't have the fortitude to stick it out,"" but that would be ridiculous. The fact is that both genders are just as rational as one another, and women know that the local district court is to their advantage.

"On the topic of Brexit- I've recently been working with some continental Europeans who work in Brussels/Strasbourg for the EU (in a way) 

Politically they dislike the British, we've always been slightly to the right of the rest of Europe and the UK has a vested interest in keeping the neoliberal financial system in place (due to the City of London). This irks France, especially, as support for contemporary financial systems is not as strong on the continent, or so they inform me. 

They see the UK as the naughty kid at the back of the class. Even the timing of the ref has annoyed some people as it's at the height of a huge crisis within the EU both the refugee and financial crisis (i.e Spain Italy Greece)

They said there is a feeling UK gets special treatment (Cameron's best of both worlds deal does appear to be true) and that frustrates the other founding members. Essentially the UK behaves badly, resists a lot of unilateral moves re refugees, financial crisis but gets a lot of attention devoted to her, something us Brits should perhaps be a tad more grateful for.

These highly politicised Europeans I have been working with don't want the UK to leave in principal but a UK lead by Eurosceptic Tories can f off for all they care, the likes of Gove, Bojo, Farage et all do damage to the whole European project through their semi-truths, jingoistic exaggerations and tactical omission of facts. I've even see Leavers on Twitter talking about taking down the EU as we leave, smashing as many windows on the way out.

The EuRef is not doing good things for our international reputation.

Edit: Should add, politically they dislike the British, however, culturally they feel the Brits have more in common with continental culture that the British realise- I don't actually agree with this, I believe British Culture and continental European culture is very different, product of being an island nation... Iron born if you will..."

Edit 4: sorry to high jack your comment /u/GiveMeDuckPics, but I hope this is helpful to you and anyone else as well. 

Okay, you doing alright? If you have a bathtub. Fill it ankle deep with warm water. Second step, ice pack. Sit on edge of bathtub feet in the water, if you're into essential oils, you can put some in the water. Your choice. (Orange is my fav). Put the ice pack on the back of your neck, okay? Take some excedrin, and give it some time. Next, have your boyfriend rub the areas between your index and thumb. And also, right in the middle of your palm is another one. It's really relaxing.

Let me know how everything goes, if you need anything else, let me know. Also, refraine from chocolate okay? If it's too processed, it can trigger your migraines, okay? If there's anything else, comment here or shoot me a PM. And I'll talk to you. 

Edit: There is actually a really good way to rub your hand but it's amazingly difficult to describe. And you have to have someone else do it. I will see if I can find something on the Internet to post here. 

Edit two: okay so this: http://imgur.com/Uuyd9qc is kind of how I do it. Notice how the hand that is being massaged only has 3 fingers showing? The pinky is bent away from the hand. See, the way I like to do it is like this: I have very slender, and well... Feminine hands. (Perk for guitar playing though!) which makes my technique a little easier. So instead of reaching around that pinky, or causing your ""patient"" discomfort by pulling it over that far. Reach through that part of the hand. If you take your hand like this: http://imgur.com/GES8LP3 you can slide it between the ""patients"" ring and pinky finger. There hand should be in between your thumb and index finger. Repeat with the other side of the hand, which is the area between the thumb and index fingers, and you're good to go! 

Edit 3: there is also an amazing crew over at /r/migraine. It's a good place to go and vent about your pain, and there's a lot of people there that can either relate to your exact pain and situation, or close enough. Plus the subreddit has themes which you can select one from. They can also offer more advice than I can here, so if you want to, go give that place a look. They're really cool, understanding, and patient. If you're having some issue explaining something, they'll try to help you along. Anywhere from medications to what songs can help migraines, which varies person to person, but they are so willing to help.

"Honestly bar rescue is bullshit. Especially after the first few seasons everything is scripted, apparently most of the visitors are actors. The owners are instructed to act crazy if they want to get rescued. They are told to bring back staff they previously fired due to their bad behavior and so they can be fired again on the show. Tons of reports of bars having to spend their own money to undo his changes and remove his equipment because he doesn't get permits. Many owners say he makes decisions that are completely baffeling considering the local demographics then either lies about the demographics or omits them in the final edit. Also some good evidence of a good amount of scenes are reshot to make Taffer look good, particularly fights(One in particular the bar owner sued because a producer pointed out Taffer's wife to him while she was scouting the bar and told him to come onto her as hard and creepily as possible Taffer came in and legit attacked the dude and in their confrontation in the show he just yelled at him and threatened to leave and they are all wearing slightly different clothes so it at least appears to have been reshot). Sure some of this info is unreliable as it comes from owners salty about their bars being closed and blaming Taffer.

"I had a coworker who would steel papertowels from the office. The office would buy a huge bulk package(enough to last 3-4 weeks) and they would be gone by the end of the week. 

We knew who it was but I had to pull security cameras video, she was taking 1 or 2 rolls every day. So we had to start putting locks on the cabinet where the towels were kept. 

Management was hesitant to fire her at first because.   
1) they hate fireing people unless it's absolutely necessary, they would rather just retrain the person   
2) she was in a sales possition and had the highest numbers in the office.    
3) no single thing she did was that big of a deal.   
4) they had no replacement lined up.

But there were a number of other regular small issues with her that showed a general lack of honesty.  When confronted she brushed it off saying ""they're paper towels, they aren't that big of a deal"". My boss said ""We pay you PLENTY ENOUGH to be able to afford your own. If I can't trust you not to rip off the company over a stupid thing like paper towels then I can't trust you in any other aspect of your job"".

Then you go against your rival who feels the same and sole purpose was to keep you away from your goal. So things tended to get heated and violent. So telling players they could not talk to the other team would cut down on the shit talking or the instigating. Now with guys switching teams as much as they do now and the culture has calmed down the rule really shouldn't be enforced.

A lot of people don't know, but having a few panic attacks here and there is completely different to actually living with it and experiencing the fear every single day. 

So, what is it like?
Well, you are restricted from what you can do. Want to go out and buy some clothes? Nope, can't do that. Want to see friends? Forget it. Want to go for a simple short walk? Haha. 

It's miserable. It consumes you. It kills you. 

I had my first panic attack when I was only nine years old and it was terrifying. Ever since then, I have actually died. I've haven't enjoyed my youth because of it. I had to stop going to school when I was 13. Eventually got homeschooled at 16, so 3 years wasted education. Finished that, but can't go to college. Bye bye career. 
I've been to therapy since I was twelve. I've tried hypnotherapy, CBT, drugs, nothing works. Now I'm housebound and suicidal. 

Your heart races, palms sweaty, head spinning, breathing shallow, complete dread. It's just heartbreaking. It really is. It hurts more watching everybody in my life just living but I'm stuck in purgatory, always on edge and in constant fear. I can't even sleep at night. Even when I'm in my room I get panicky. It's like I'm a prisoner. I wish SA was more understood."

Hate to break it to you, but that is not a low sex drive. Wasn't married, but was in a 3 year relationship where towards the end, it was once a month, and there are people out there who have worse waits. If you don't have a healthy sex life, communicate. Don't try to guilt your partner into sex, but make sure they know how you feel. It could be that they don't feel sexually attractive, or feel insecure, and that is the reason they don't want to have sex. Just talk to your partner, and if it turns out there is just no sexual chemistry, sometimes you have to move on. Sex is a very important part of a relationship. Not everything, but it is important, otherwise you are just roommates."

"I fucking hate this. I was at a museum a few weeks ago using the restroom, and in the stall next to me this mother was berating her child for taking her pants off in the common area of the restroom. If this was like at least a 7 yr old kid I'd understand, by that age they can at least know to keep their clothes on. But I glance over and see tiny feet. This kid can't be more than 4 or 5. The child is responding with typical 4-5 yr old speech patterns, crying, and doesn't understand half of what the mom is yelling at her. Also the mom slaps her a bit.

Like, fuck, be more understanding with your goddamn 5 yr old. they're stupid, it's YOUR job to teach them how not to be stupid.. not to berate them for failing to magically having the cognitive skills of an adult. Like wtf. 

The way some parents treat their children, it's like they're flabbergasted that the kid has to LEARN things and doesn't automatically come with the Big Kid Social Propriety Expert Pro packaged installed."

However, considering estimates place between 600,000 and 950,000 black bears in North America and only 30,000 to 50,000 brown bears, depending on source, you can see brown bears are about 20x more likely to kill you.

"One could go for hours just on the process of WGA arbitration. It's very common for a movie to get made from a script that got touched along the way by a bunch of different people working in a bunch of different capacities. Before the movie hits the screen it has to be worked out, once and for all, just who gets credit. Like the literal on-screen ""Written By"" credit. The process of figuring out who gets the credit is called arbitration, and it's handled by the Writers Guild of America. It often comes down to figuring out which writer contributed *each individual typewritten line* in the shooting script, and because the answer is only rarely unambiguous, *that* process often boils down to figuring out which writer, if any, was personally responsible for *51% of an individual typewritten line.*

It might sound ridiculous if you're not familiar with the process, but it really does make sense when you put it all together, and it really is necessary. It's just mind-bogglingly daunting the first time you have to go through it yourself."

Came, finished shower, dried off, dressed, went downstairs... got a phone call and learned that the girl I had just been jerking off thinking about had taken her own life the previous night. 

I credit this fucked-up moment in my life as the birth of my predilection for damaged girls. I think self harm is an awful thing, and I've worked hard to overcome my own depression – but at the same time, I can't kid myself seeing self-harm scars on a cute girl doesn't do something to me.

"Yeah my wife and I enjoy going to Vegas because it's not super expensive. We stay at Mandalay Bay or MGM every time, and I can get a upgraded room for like $150-$180 a night, and it's a fucking awesome room comparatively to other hotels. I look up the discount codes, use those, and book airfare and stuff together. It's cheap to fly there, cheap to stay there for the quality of the room, etc.

That being said the food and stuff is expensive, but we've been there enough we know all the cheap places to get food, we know the best buffets, we know our favorite restaurants, we get cheap show tickets, etc. It helps neither of us are big gamblers. We'll sit down at a slot machine and put $20 in just got have a waitress bring us a drink, tip her, cash out, and walk around with our free drinks.

Vegas isn't for everyone, and yes it's just a big tourist trap, but it's fun. We just like walking around, people watching, enjoying the pool, catching a show, eating some good food, and in general just enjoying the sites.

I love Vegas, but it's not for everyone. But for us it's a cheap little get away, and it's not a place you have to stay long. Even just going for a couple nights can be a good release."

Well two minutes later I'm standing up at the register (which is right next to the pharmacy) and the dog stares me in the eyes as it pisses all over the goat hair carpet. I finally blink and ask the woman if it was a service dog. She said ""No, does it have to be to be allowed inside the store?"" Now on the front doors we have two huge signs that say ""NO ANIMALS ALLOWED INSIDE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SERVICE ANIMALS."" I told her yes it had to be a service animal. She proceeded to bitch me out for the entire 10 minutes I spent cleaning up her dog's piss."

"Met a girl on holiday once that i had a huge crush on but obviously never did anything about it because 17 year old me was a dick. Life continues and still occassionally thought of her because you know, she was BEAUTIFUL. (and we had about 5 conversations all told but thats all it took). 
 Anyway I go off to university about a year later(other end of the country) and in the freshers day where everyone walks around signing up for things they never go to and collecting bags of trinkets  a hot girl walks past that i see out the corner of my eye and i'm like 'no way was that her, that would be to coincidental'. I turn around just to check but its busy and think nothing more of it. 
 Fast forward some more months and me and my friend are stood in a queue outside of a bar when i think i hear my name being called... 'No its just probably someone else' etc etc we go inside and its forgotten...
 Now its towards the end of the year and i'm in the bar downstairs in my halls of residence (pretty drunk, and possibly still sporting a huge cut on my eye from a drink related incident prior - im not in my best state) and my friend taps me on the shoulder and says: 'hey, have you seen the girl over there? she is blatantly the hottest one in here'...

Holy Shit. Its her.

So my mind does any number of backflips and cartwheels and i turn to my friend (who has no idea of the above backstory) and say: 'well i'm going to talk to her'. 

I walk over and it turns out that yes, she was at the freshers fair, and yes, indeed it was her that was calling out to me that night outside the bar which i ignored. The fates have aligned, she's right here in front of me which i've wished to happen ever since i wussed out on that holiday aaaand...

I mumbled 'something'(?) Honestly cannot remember but what i do remember is kissing her hand and walking away without just. taking. a. chance. and never seeing her again.

"I'm a little late, but this is my favorite story about a good friend of mine and her now husband.

My good friend (let's call her Jane) and her then fiancee (let's call him Jack) were going to get married in Las Vegas.  They had been many times before, but I had never been and Jane asked me to be the Maid of Honor at her wedding.  A few days before the wedding itself, they both wanted me to walk the entirety of the Vegas Strip with them.  As we are walking down the Strip, we see guys every block or so handing out those nudie cards with the nipples and the cooch censored out, but still in very provocative poses (leaving little to the imagination), advertising one of the local strip clubs/nudie bars nearby.  Jack is picking these up by the handful, and Jane isn't batting an eye.  I'm perplexed.

We get back to the hotel and I ask Jack why he is collecting so many of these cards.  I find out that he is a *huge* Magic the Gathering player at home, and he collects the nudie cards to barter with the 13-14 y/o boys to get better cards.  He's apparently made a rather impressive deck over the years."

"Well my dad ""raised"" a family of pink plastic flamingos in the corner of the yard closest to her for two years. It started as one bird a friend gifted us as a joke, but we realized it bothered her so my dad got another one. Spring time came and so did some massive brightly colored eggs. They hatched into four adorable little baby flamingos who all had a baby themselves the next year.

Her family had what we lovingly refer to as the Christmas smack down in the front yard the year we moved there, so we grabbed some lawn chairs and a camera and cheered on the only guy over there trying to calm down 6-7 screaming women.

She ran out in front of my sister and yelled at her to slow down when she couldn't have been going over ten mph (she had literally just made the turn out of the driveway) so that night we made one of her light up reindeers mount the other one and left one of the brightly colored eggs underneath since we couldn't find a cheap baby deer cut out.

And my favorite one by far is when she didn't put the brake on her riding lawnmower so it ended up rolling down her lawn and tipping onto its side in the road. We went and let her know it was blocking traffic on our (deadend) road and if she didn't move it we'd have to make a complaint to the city. She had to call the guy from the Christmas smackdown to get it back right side up.

"Since everyone here already talked about general discharge, I'd like to chime in about period stains specifically.

For a lot of women, predicting their period is kinda like predicting the weather, except every single month. You can look at the forecast saying it will rain, and see the dark clouds outside the window, but you don't know if it will rain today, tonight, tomorrow, or the day after. It is obviously not practical to carry an open umbrella around all the time. So it's very likely that in case of sudden showers, no matter how prepared you are, you're bound to get a little wet in the time it takes you to open up your umbrella that you brought with you.. But it doesn't matter as long as nobody notices you're wet.

Also, if the umbrella isn't wide enough, you can get wet from the sides at any time, if the umbrella leaks water. Women tend to leak most often while sleeping, because you can't sleep in a straight prim and proper way.

Also, sometimes the rain will stop for a considerable amount of time, and you'll think now there's no need to continue carrying an umbrella... And boom! Sudden showers the day after, and you're taken by surprise and have to run to the nearest store to buy an umbrella to protect yourself."

"'Dave would you mind coming up to the front of the class.'

'Sure', Dave made his way to the front. The class full of women, watching his every step. Once up front he turned around facing the class.

'As you can see class, Dave has on a classic pair of shorts and he does wear them nicely. We call them biker shorts because at one point in time these were used usually exclusively for biking. 

'Yes these types of shorts caused quite a stir in there day. Class, notice how the fabric hugs Dave's penis. You can clearly see the outline. Look here are his balls.', Mrs. Nelson's finger traced the fabric along Dave's testicals and continued to follow her dissertation. 'And here is his shaft. Yup and that looks like the head of his penis right there.'

Dave was turning red. 'I'm sorry, am I embarrassing you Dave?', Mrs. Nelson asked in a concerned manner.

'Ahh kind of Mrs. Nelson. Can I sit down now?'

'No not yet. And I'm sorry about embarrassing you Dave. But you really should NOT be embarrassed. In fact we will cure you of that by the end of the semester.' She got a gleam in her eye as she put her hand on his shoulder and raised her eyes from his crotch to look Dave in the eye to say. Mrs. Nelson gave Dave a warm comforting smile. Dave seemed terrified.

Ooh cool Jenny thought to herself. How big was it anyway?  Jenny vividly pictured it in her head. 

Jenny came back to reality when Mrs. Nelson said, 'Oooooh my...Look class! Dave is getting an erection' All eyes took in the sight. Dave's cock was expanding in the biker shorts, causing more pressure against the fabric making it even more visible. 'You might be embarrassed Dave but I think your little friend there seems to like what is required in this course.'

'Can I sit down now?' 

'Sorry just one more minute, hang in there.' Mrs. Nelson soothed him. Dave valiantly stood there as Mrs. Nelson continued.

'Class for ages men wore loose fitting clothing. They could get erections at will and no one would ever know. In fact women really had a hard time telling how big a male really was unless she was getting intamate with him. Nowadays any man wearing loose fitting, visually restrictive clothing would be laughed at and otherwise completely ignored. Yes we take so many things for granted nowadays ladies. Just look at Dave's fine penis. He certainly cannot hide the fact that he is aroused. He has grown considerably. I would say it's a good 5 or 6 incher. Very Nice Dave, you may sit down now'.

With her eyes on the outline of his cock, Jenny watched Dave walk by her. She could tell he was looking at her but she didn't care. She was more interested in looking at the outline of his hard cock as he went by. Dave walked by and took his seat.

Mrs. Nelson prowled the classroom. 'You there, what is your name?'

'Mike'.

'Mike please come up to the front of the room with me'

Jenny was really enjoying this course. It was much more interesting then Calculus.

When Mike got to the front of the room Mrs. Nelson said, 'As you can see class, Mike has on the latest rage in men's fashion. The MC pants made their debut years ago in the European territories but only lately have they become popular in the Americas. And it's about time, don't you think girls?'

MC pant's were Male Cleavage pants. The were the equivalent for males what the low cut blouse is for women.

Mrs. Nelson continued, 'For thousands of years women's fashion required a women to expose parts of her breasts for men's enjoyment. A small chested women was not usually as desirable as a full figured women. Now we finally have parody!'

The MC pant's were regular pants except that the front portion was made of see through material, or in more daring versions no material at all! 'Conservative' MC pants would only reveal some pubic hair. Others would actually expose the first inch or more of the shaft!! 

'However', Mrs. Nelson continued, 'Ladies, even in this enlightened age it is against public decentcy laws to have the head of a penis exposed in public. This is very similar to how TV in the US around the late 20th and early 21st century could show large portions of breasts but never the nipples. And public beaches could have string bikinis as long as no areola's were showing. Quite silly when you think about it. But this is and was the reality.'

'You look quite stunning Mike, you look like a very....(her eyes dropped to look at his exposed shaft)... distinguished gentleman. Class what do you think of this new style of pants?'

A cute girl in the front row said ,'I think they are hot! I mean I like biker shorts, speedos, pouches, sock shorts, tight jeans etc but these are.....nice.'

The class was in agreement. Mrs. Nelson commented, 'I couldn't agree more. And these pants are quite daring. Normally a man will only show an inch of shaft. The more daring 2 or 3 at the most. But we are very fortunate class. Mike is exposing quite an impressive amount of skin. In fact that is one of the things that makes these pants so wonderful. If you want to look good, be in vogue and impress the ladies, the more shaft you show the better. However, with the public decency laws being what they are you need a large sized penis to keep the head out of sight. So basically the larger the penis the more shaft you can comfortably show. '

'Isn't this wonderful class. Look at the endowment. Mike has been truly blessed down there and now we can all appreciate it, instead of maybe one or two girlfriends. Look at the girth, truly a wider then normal shaft and ooh my'. Under the scrutinay of the classes' gaze Mike's cock started to harden. 'Wonderful! Just Wonderful!!', clapping her hands in excitement, she continued, 'Look class, the folds of skin are disappearing as his cock, err um I mean his penis lengthens and thickens. Notice how it runs down the side of his leg. Jeez it looks really hard. Is that uncomfortable Mike?'

'Ahhh ya kind of', answered Mike. He was have trouble standing up straight now because of his erection.

Mrs. Nelson eyes sparkled as she commented, 'Well that's one of the nice features of these types of pants. Men in the past would get erections and have to suffer as it squirmed for space. Normally they could get no relief. But with these pants that isn't a problem, or at least if your not out in public anywhere. But this is a private institution so Mike if you would like to demonstrate that feature of the pants for the class that would be great!'

His voice cracked as he said, 'Here? Now?'.

'Ooh don't be silly Mike.', she crept up and put her arm around him as she cooed, 'Look at how much of your penis you are already showing to us!' Mrs. Nelson tried to keep her composure. Her nipples where incredibly hard beneath her blouse and the moisture between her legs was intense. As a professor and a distinguished faculty member of the school she needed to keep her composure. With her other hand on his stomach she said. ''Here let me help you.' 

Her hand slid past his belt buckle, past the exposed public hair and lightly danced along the 4 inches of exposed shaft, as her warm hand wrapped around that hot piece of meat.

Jenny couldn't believe it. Mrs. Nelson's hand wrapped around his shaft and gave it a tug. Out it sprang. The class was amazed. Mrs Nelson had just pulled his cock out of pants!!! Every set of eyes in the class were fixed on the now fully exposed penis."

"Wife got cancer in 2012.  It was a really rough time, and under my nose she developed a pain pill addiction.  I was on patrol with the coast guard so I was gone a LOT at sea.  Anyway she got better and came clean about pain pill addiction.  I understood and we kept working at it.  She constantly needed money for her cancer treatments (understandably) I always thought my insurance covered everything, but she kept needing extra money because it was in clinical trials.  Like 1700 every couple of weeks.  Fast forward a couple of years and she convinces me to get out of the Coast Guard.  

I agree to help her get better.  Moved back home close to my family and she keeps needing money CONSTANTLY.  I have to keep asking my family, (we had a lot of land).  One of the things that always threw up red flags was I was never allowed to go with her on her treatments.  One day I get suspicious and look at her phone while she was sleeping.  Turns out she was cheating on me with her ""gay"" friend.  Flip out almost get divorced, but I forgive her, because facing your mortality and whatnot can make you do stupid shit.  We work on it for a couple of months and I still feel something is up.

One day I come home because she is too sick to take care of our kids (happened all the time).  Decide to check her phone while she is ""sleeping"".  Turns out she has been cheating on me again with the same dude and there was two others I didn't know about, and all of the cancer ""treatments"" was a massive heroin addiction.  I kicked her out and have been raising our two kids ever since.  She is currently awaiting trial for bank robbery and our divorce is almost finalized.  Fucking hell she took a lot outta me.."

"My ex used to scratch herself to the point of having scars, would say that she wanted to kill herself or go back to doing drugs and if we had sex she would feel better, said she didn't want me to have any female friends then a week later said she didn't want me to have friends, told me to say things about my life that would make people sad and then she would get mad when her friends got sad by it, lied about her past, got mad when I told her she shouldn't hang with people that were trying to get her to do drugs, she made me lose a friend I had for years (and was my only friend I've ever had), my first time having sex was with her and she knew I didn't want it but made it happen anywho, she wanted me to hit her (as in how it would be considered abusive hitting), she posted pictures of herself with makeup that looked like she was beaten and so I had to deal with the flak of that, she would pick at my insecurities and make fun of my feelings, she got me to cut off contact with m brother, and she didn't like how I would get upset when she lied to me.

"While the mortality rate for slaves being transported across the Atlantic was as high as 10%, the percentage of slaves dying in transit in the Transsahara and East African slave trade was between 80 and 90%!

While almost all the slaves shipped across the Atlantic were for agricultural work, most of the slaves destined for the Muslim Middle East were for sexual exploitation as concubines, in harems, and for military service.

While many children were born to slaves in the Americas, and millions of their descendants are citizens in Brazil and the USA to this day, very few descendants of the slaves that ended up in the Middle East survive.

While most slaves who went to the Americas could marry and have families, most of the male slaves destined for the Middle East were castrated, and most of the children born to the women were killed at birth.

"Generally you can't be an organ donor and donate your body.  

This is for a few reasons; programs that use the bodies (med schools) need the entire body intact to show the location of organs.  The programs also want the students to do the dissections to give them a better sense of how things are laid out/what cutting into a body is like before they do it on a living person.  Finally, if major organs are removed, it's VERY difficult to adequately embalm a body as many major blood vessels are severed.  As a result, the inadequately embalmed tissue decomposes and...well...gets a bit ripe.

Later on systems gained ethernet ports, but weren't wireless.  And even when the wireless ones came out, they weren't great.  I actually had a set-up in the back of the store where I showed all the different methods of updating, and the ps3 was BY FAR the fastest and easiest.  I sold systems based on this alone

Nobody wanted to laugh out of respect, but thankfully Sensei has a good sense of humor and just said ""and THAT is a powerful kime"". We lost it and finally ended up doing stretching and cardio stuff instead because we would all start giggling whenever we had to do *kime*."

"Preface: This is not going to be an incest story.  Get your goddamn minds out of the gutter, reddit.

----

For my 21^st birthday, my sister took me out to drink at the bar she worked at.  I got pretty goddamn drunk, as most citizens of Milwaukee tend to do.  My sister decided I wasn't going to be able to make it home, so she left a little bit early to clean up her living room so I could crash on the couch.

When I left the bar, I was *barely* able to walk straight.  Thankfully I only had three blocks to walk.  I was one block away from her apartment building when it happened:

A VW van came from the direction of the bar.  The driver was obviously drunk.  MUCH more drunk than I was - weaving all over the place.  When it got close to me, it swerved over and jumped the curb onto the sidewalk.  I thought I was going to die, and may have peed just a little bit.  The van hit the building I was next to and skipped off of it back to the street.  It passed close enough to me that I could have reached out to touch it without fully extending my arm.

I finished walking to my sister's apartment and never told her about it.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I've never told any of my family about it."

That being said, it doesn't have to be a love story, it just has to be somebody you've known for a while and give a shit about. I'm not really strict about what comprises ""romance"". Maybe it's just that I'm not as good at forming connections with new people as others are?"

They lived in a *very* small town, so there was talk, but he made it known in no uncertain terms that that is his son in every way that matters and he wouldn't take kindly to anyone acting otherwise.  That was the end of that.  

He didn't even marry my mom until I was in my late teens, but he treats me the same.  We're all lucky to have him as our dad."

"Kanye West. Hear me out.  

Kanye West growing up was nobody. He came from a middle class, single mother household and had to work his way into the music industry from the very bottom, making beats for local artists just to get a paycheck. Eventually, after making hundreds of beats, carrying around his demo tape and playing them for any music executives he could find, he risked his finances to move to New York and carry out his dream.  

Even then, no one would hear him as a rapper. After all, he had no underground or hard-edged appeal. In the hip hop mainstream at the time, the only songs and records that charted were all more ""gangster"" while Kanye was just a regular guy from the middle class. He had no gun and didn't deal drugs. He instead was a pink-polo wearing backpacker. How could that ever get popular?  

After making stellar beats as a producer for Jay Z, he finally earned his chance and was signed to Jay Z's label. His debut album The College Dropout featured a retro soul sound that was out of place in the public at the time and still holds up today. His lyrics didn't emphasize popular hip-hop topics and instead focused on materialism, family, faith alongside the typical swagger.  
His next album fused orchestral elements into his sound and was even more critically acclaimed than his first. And his third album fused electronic house with rap to give yet another new sound that was first of its kind in the mainstream. After outselling 50 Cent, the public seemed to agree that West's reign over the public eye [had begun.](http://www.complex.com/music/2015/09/the-day-kanye-west-killed-gangsta-rap)  

Then, in 2007 his mother tragically passed away relatively young from a complication with plastic surgery. After giving a [tearful live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCYAjGnvc7U) he set off to do an unprecidented move for a musician of his size and made an album with no coolness or rapping with 808s and Heartbreak, predicted to flop hard yet sold well and is now considered one of the most [influential](http://pitchfork.com/features/overtones/9725-the-coldest-story-ever-told-the-influence-of-kanye-wests-808s-heartbreak/) albums of all [time](http://www.rollingstone.com/most-groundbreaking-albums-of-all-time).  

His fifth album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kanye  needed to win back the public after being an idiot to Taylor Swift, and sought to make a perfect album. MBDTF is absolutely fantastic from a musical and creative perspective, and I'll just stop here with the bio.  

I respect Kanye for his talent and his perseverence for following his dreams and putting in the immense amount of effort he put in to achieve what he set out to do. Do I care what he does in his public appearances? Nope. He can talk however much shit he pleases, because he has earned any bragging rights there are. After his mother died it is obvious that he is unstable and cannot communicate properly. If he committed an actual crime other than being a dick I will change my mind.

Honestly if you dislike Kanye, listen to one of his albums and you will likely respect his craft. He is an artist in every sense of the word and he had no one pull strings for him. He worked for his position today and didn't give a fuck if anyone told him he couldn't."

"I'm just a law student, but I worked on a pro bono case where we represented sex offenders who had committed repeat offenses. Basically the legislature passed a law around 2007ish that all sex offenders who had committed repeat offenses had to wear GPS trackers, which some attorneys felt was a violation of their rights. 

That might be dandy if this was a going-forward thing, but it applied retroactively. The state initially won in showing it was not an ex post facto punishment, but the challenges are currently in the middle of a Fourth Amendment unreasonable search series of challenges. 

Also, many of the people monitored were ""repeat"" offenders only because they committed another crime--not necessarily another sex offense--after the first sex offense conviction. 

I never met any of them, but I think the party in our case was the kind of sympathetic background story (peed-in-the-bushes sex offense in another state plus a minor robbery or trespassing something here) that demonstrated the law's foolishness."
"&gt;6) No crazy talk.

Of all the rules I was expecting to see after the first 5, this was not one of them. As an awkward nerdy skinny guy who didn't get his first girlfriend until he was 19, and didn't have any sexual contact at all until 23, what is wrong with these guys? There must be some other mental issues going on there, this is way more extreme than even the guys that bitch about being ""friendzoned""."
"yeah it's definitely an oversimplification. I think it's more on the person's attitude towards friendships. If someone says they can only get a long with the opposite sex they probably have some insecurities of some sort.

1) We've added about 1/3 the weapons to the American population in the last 8-10 years.  That's over **100 million guns**.  If guns caused, crime, violence, suicide, or anything else, **we should have seen a bump.** We didn't.

2) All across the country we have seen a massive relaxation in gun laws.  Many states don't even require a permit to carry a loaded concealed firearm in public.  Millions more people are carrying firearms in public than just a few years ago, and more are doing so every day.  If guns caused crime or violence of any kind, we would have surely seen an increase.

3) Despite all this, the crime rate is actually dropping.  Don't fix what ain't broke.

With that said, opinions are like assholes 'cause everybody's got one.  Sure enough, I have some suggestions.

* Legalize marijuana, both medically and recreationally.  This results in a significant reduction in suicide, especially in the at-risk white male population.

* Green public spaces.  This has been repeatedly shown to reduce crime and violence, increase academic performance, increase health, and has a whole host of other beneficial effects.

* Don't be a dick.  People need hope and an ability to work and provide for a family.  Relax the housing laws so the tinyhouse people can give homes to people.  Bring outside play time into education.  Sponsor free healthcare independent of health insurance.  And for fuck's sake stop bombing innocent people in the Middle East.

There is your example and then there are payday lendors who might charge $50 for $500 for a week. It might be easy to fall for the idea that it's a 10% fee, but when you think about it it is actually 520% APR. ($50x52 weeks in a year=$2600 interest paid/$500 loan amount=520% APR). The worst I have seen was 1400%."

"^^^This. I was in Africa and asked why kids drop out of school. Girls drop out because they get their periods (there is no TP at the school, as you can imagine, and clothes are used to wear... not bleed over) so they drop out out of embarrassment.

"It really isn't. Transmission rates for homosexual intercourse are at a different scale compared to heterosexual intercourse. There is a reason it affects the gay community far more.

edit:
Thought I'd expand a bit more. The HIV strain that is prevalent in the west is not the same as the most prevalent strain in Western Africa. The strain in the west isn't transmitted as readily in semen/vaginal fluid, but transmits much easier in blood-blood contact. The converse is true in African strains of the virus. This has obvious implications, as anal sex is much more likely to create blood-blood contact."
Truly disgusting. Thank you for this
"While ""buying sex"" is the opposite of a strong relationship; doing chores to help lubricate the process of arousal isn't. First off, we're talking about people with different sexually drives. While some people might have the same sexually drive timing that allows them to be in sync and ready to do, others will not.

Stress is not conducive for sex, regardless the gender. Women, however, are statically more likely to be doing the lion's share of housework. This is on top of any other jobs she may have. They also respond to different types of sexually arousal (ie: manual stimulation without being in the right mental mindset can result in no/low sexual response in return). This is to say that stress can be a deterrent to having sexual desires and result in someone ""not being in the mood"". Doing the dishes isn't about buying sex. In fact, just because you do dishes, doesn't mean that you're going to have sex. What is does mean is that the person not doing the dishes has one less thing to stress about. It gives the person one more moment to relax and allow them to get to the comfort level that encourages sexy time."

"When I was in college, I ran with a bit of a bad crowd.   Mostly drug-related - but with that came some other thigs that weren't so ""moral/legal"".   

Through these drug-friends, I was introduced to a guy who had won a couple of  million in the lottery.   He was not from means, and had already had a heart attack once - so he figured that his ability to spend his cash would not exceed his ability to live.  

While he didn't buy a new house, he did buy a somewhat fancy car - though it was probably only 60k... But the rest of the money went to us.

The guy was probably about 60 years old, and what do 60 year olds like?  20 year old girls.   And strippers.   And drugs.   

Hanging out with Henry was like an episode of the twilight zone... Need $500 bucks?   Hang out topless for an hour.   Need $1000 bucks?   Clean out his garage?   Need a car?   No problem - he rented most of the cars from an Avis for months on end (we even crashed one of them - and that's how I got my only MIP!).  Need some drugs?   How about an 8-ball for the night...   And don't forget to take all the Molly he's got as well.  Need to go to a strip club wth all your friends?   Henry's got you- and all your friends... And drugs for all the strippers.   

This went on for about a year before the cash ran out.  Last I heard he was still alive, but living in an RV.    Not how I would do it, personally.   "

"There was this guy... Jimmy. I met him at a party. He was great, we hit it off really well, we started dating. He had 2 jobs; he was an apprentice electrician during the day and was also the on-call person for a 24 hour business. So if someone doesn't show up for a shift they call him, he goes in to work. Most of the time he wouldn't be able to stay the night, he'd have to go cover a graveyard or swing shift. Sometimes he'd set his alarm for really really early. There was a week where his car was in the shop and he needed me to drive him around for a few days. He's my boyfriend, I'm glad to do it. The first day, he realized he'd forgotten his work badge at his apartment, so we went over there. This was maybe 3 months into the relationship, it was the first time I'd ever been there. He'd been putting me off, saying it was embarrassing and he had so many roommates there was no privacy. So we go to his apartment, it's in the very bad part of town. It was gross and smelly and probably nobody who lived there did any cleaning. There's 4 skeezy guys hanging out in the living room. He says hi to them, introduces me and then ushers me to his room. His room was not the master bedroom and it had a double bed sized futon on one side of the room and a twin mattress on the floor on the other side of the room. His bed was the twin. His dresser was four crates by the foot of his mattress. The double bed was where his roommate Frank slept. Okay, cool, I saw where he lived, it was just as bad as he'd said. I'd never have to go back there until it was time to get a place together. So the relationship was going really well. We'd exchanged ""I love you's"" and were spending a lot more time together, when we weren't working. We were together for almost a year. And I got a phone call from him the week before Valentine's day. 

""Hi Jimmy!""

""This isn't Jimmy, this is Jimmy's *wife*!"" ""Are you the whore that's been screwing my husband?"" ""Did you know he has an eight-year-old son?"" 

So I told her I wasn't aware of that and would definitely rethink our relationship. 

The next day, I came home from work to find he'd called my roommate to let him in so he could take all of his stuff that he'd left at my place. He turned his phone off and I never saw or heard from him again. His apartment was actually Frank's apartment, he'd never lived there, Frank gleefully informed me, hoping I'd scream and throw stuff or something. I just sort of dumbly stood there, said okay and left; sorry to disappoint you Frank.

Here it is 10 years later and it's still hard to believe that happened. I couldn't believe someone could be that duplicitous. And I couldn't believe that of all the friends I'd met in that year, of all the ""roommates"" I'd met, all of them were in on his scam and nobody ever told me the truth. It's just disappointing that that many people could be that awful."

"As I mentioned in an earlier comment, I'm not a defense attorney, but I did work briefly for the Public Defender's Office during law school.

While there, I was assigned to a prostitution case. My client was an Asian lady in her 60s who had resorted to selling her services on backpage.net. Her business was quite lucrative, so she started pimping out a few other girls as well. 

My client didn't speak a word of English--or so I thought. So we brought in a translator to get the lowdown from the client. The next 30 minutes was the second most embarrassing and awkward experience in my life. Through a translator, she regaled me with the story of how she got into the business and how she had started pimping and her ""specialties"" in the trade. At one point, I'm even fairly certain she was trying to hit on me, but I digress. She told me about her ad that she had posted and how she had gotten a service call based on that ad (from the undercover cop). After awhile, she needed to take a break, so I briefly scanned over the incident report that my colleague had just dropped off. Apparently, the officer arrived at the door, was forcefully yanked through the door by his shirt collar and offered anal sex. He noted that the only things in the hotel room were a 50 pack of condoms and a Costco-sized tub of Vaseline. Needless to say, we sought a plea bargain.

The most embarrassing moment of my life came shortly after when I had to walk her through her guilty plea and repeat--in front of the judge and on the record--the only English words she knew, ""50 dollars gets you anal."""

"Yeah.  Has nothing to do with the old ""tread on the tires"" mantra, either.

Let's say a girl says in the past year, she's slept with 6 different guys. For me, I'd be put off. I'd wonder, why exactly didn't a relationship develop from any of these? Why is she single now?

I'd be afraid that A) I'm just guy number 7 on her way to 8.
or B) I've no idea who any of those people were. I'd be interested in knowing what kind kind of standards she has, i.e. if any of them smoke, how their hygiene is, etc. Though it sounds insecure, her former partners will certainly present a gauge for what her standards are for me. 

It also presents information about how quickly people progress with their relationship. Some people might jump to sex very quickly. Some might want to get to know someone first. If you've had sex with 6 different people in a year (honestly, even 2 or 3), for me, that's hypersexual, and not the kind of personality I think I can cope with."
"After the Aurora shooting, I was talking to my parents about this; they told me that they had discussed it before.

I like my parents. I truly don't mean to sound facetious or make light of any tragedies-- that's just what they (hope) they'd have the courage to do."

"""Hey man, I know this looks bad but you'll be fine. You just gotta keep your head up."""
"I am a 60 year-old man from U.S. who started studying Islam over 35 years ago.  What got me interested in it was a quote in the newspaper around 1981 (no internet at that time) in which the Ayatollah Khomeini (the fellow who overthrew the Shah of Iran) said that music was an afront to Allah and should be banned.  Well, I thought then, as now, that everyone is born with a song in their heart so how could music possibly offend God?  So, I decided to learn about Islam and try to understand how such ideas came about.   

I read the Koran, it took three tries over a long period of years, it is a hard book to read.  I also read many of the Hadiths (memories of the sayings and doings of the prophet Mohammud) and lots of other things in general.  None of this has made me an expert on Islam but I think I know enough to say some things that might be of interest.  So, here we go.

Is Islam to blame for the shooting in Florida?  That's seems to be the question a lot of people in this thread are struggling with.  As you may have already figured out for yourself, there is no neat answer to the question.  But if you change the question to this - did Islam have something to do with the shooting in Florida - then it would appear that the answer is almost certainly yes (and I am relying on the correctness of some of the news reports that are at this time alleging a connection between the shooter and religious radicals and ideas).  So, what exactly is the role of Islam when the radicals turn violent?

One way of answering that question is to compare Christianity with Islam, I believe there is a central difference that can be identified and that is important to know.  I notice that in the wake of such events as this shooting some redditors denounce all religious zealots, they deem all religions equally to blame for violence in society.  I think this view is wrong so lets get to the difference that, as I said, really matters. 

Christianity's bible, in particular certain passages in the Old Testament, portray a God that seems to endorse mass killings in the context of ancient middle-eastern tribes attempting to follow God's will.  Also, the New Testament makes clear the position that if you do not believe in the divinity of Jesus, then you are not going to heaven when you die.  But what does the bible not say?  It does not say that those who do not believe in the good book are the enemy of those who do (quite the contrary, right?).  And here lies the important difference with the Koran.  The Koran begins with a tribute passage to Christianity and Judaism but rather quickly evolves into a tract that is increasingly hostile towards the ""unbeliever"" aka infidel aka Kaffir.  The unbeliever is portrayed as acting against the will of Allah and therefore the believers must defeat the unbelievers who are all going to everlasting hell anyway.  And yes, the Koran does go so far as to instruct the believers to cut of the head of the infidel and slay the believer where you find him.  At a minimum, the unbeliever is to be ruled by the believers but can keep his own religion as long as he pays a special tax to the believers.  Bear in mind that the Koran is deemed infallible by the believer, or is supposed to be, because it is Allah's own words passed down to humankind without error through the prophet Mohammud.  In sum, in my opinion there is no counterpart in all this in Christianity and those who say or imply otherwise are wrong.

And so, if the features of Islam just noted are correct, how come the Muslims in your town or city haven't attacked unbelievers with sticks and knives, why haven't they also followed the prophet's message to attack, defeat and subdue?  Well, I think most Muslims, and I've now known quite a few, regard these issues as theology which does not concern them directly.  They are aware that there are Imams who preach violence, but they are also aware that there are a growing number of Imams worldwide who do not.  So they put the issue on the shelf and let themselves (not all but most for sure) be guided by their own natural decency and goodness.  And so, here is one of the crucial facts to take away from yesterday's shooting:  Assuming there are three million Muslims in the U.S., one of them committed an atrocity, an act of sheer evil yesterday.  The other 2,999,999 Muslims did not. Some of the latter have been brave enough to post here, one saying he hates the shooter, another saying she is afraid that people will now see her as a terrorist because of the color of her skin.  These are good people who want nothing more than to be accepted as fellow good citizens, and to be seen as a friend to those around them.  

So, what does the future hold?  Donald Trump wants a time out on Muslim immigration until we can get a handle on the violence.  Popular liberal commentator Bill Maher recently wondered aloud if Islam has something to do with radical violence.  In a roundabout way, I would say they are addressing the same issue.  If more Muslims immigrate to the U.S., does that mean that radical violence will increase?  I think the answer is yes.  If one million immigrants arrive, I believe some (a half-dozen?  twenty? It's impossible to say, isn't it) are going to either already be radicalized or, more likely, will become radicalized sometime in the future (and immigration authorities cannot ""vet"" immigrants for radicalization that hasn't happened yet).  Bear in mind too that England and Germany have both seen native Christians convert to Islam and become radicalized, so it is not always a question of consequences of immigration.  So then, what are you going to do - let the immigrants in knowing that the occasional shooter/bomber is likely to sprout - or do we turn them away and if so, what does closing the hand of compassion and friendship do to our souls?  I don't have the answer, I don't think anyone does.

A word about guns.  I am a person who enjoys the shooting range, so does MSNBC liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow (you can look it up).  But I know, and Rachel knows, that clip fed weapons are a big part of the problem, Sarah Brady reminded us of that for years until her recent passing.  I believe Congress has the power to ban all clip fed weapons and limit commercial firearms to six shots -  bolt or lever action rifles and revolvers.  I don't think it can go further without an amendment to the Constitution.  Until the clips are gone, the mass shootings, religiously motivated or not, will be with us always.  And that's just a fact.

I'll close with a good book recommendation for those who want a quick course, two books actually.  First, Among the Believers, An Islamic Journey by V. S. Naipal (1981), a great writer.  No one has got into the head if the Islamic radical as far as Naipal has, and it's not a pretty picture.  Then, Islam Unveiled by Robert Spencer (2002), a 180-page overview of Islam.  Spencer has been pilloried as a right-winger and he has made a few wild comments that are to his discredit.   However, he is capable of being sober and fair and he is a scholar's scholar.  This is his best book and it is excellent for those who seek a quick, accurate look into Islam.

My heart goes out to all those affected by yesterday's tragedy and God Bless us all, everyone, as Mr. Dickens once said.  





A quick word about translations for those who may go looking into these things for themselves.  Several universities have posted copies of the Koran in which the most inflammatory passages have been softened in translation to English.  I am sure this is well-intentioned but if you read one of these, you are not, I repeat not, reading the Koran the way a person in Egypt of Pakistan would read it.

I even talked to his mother, concerned that my buddy was struggling with an addiction. If he was sick, I wanted to help him, even if he hated me for it. I didn't wanna see him end up in jail or dead.

But nope - he was just a garden variety thief who yelled at me for ""tattling to his mom"".

A few years later, I found out from a mutual friend that he had fucked several of my girlfriends behind my back through the years and had recently bragged about never being caught doing it.

Fuck you Steve. You traded a friend who had your back for life for a measly $500 and some trashy pussy. Hope it was worth it, you prick.

Although I don't know how effective of a president Bernie would be considering he'll likely face bigger opposition against Republicans than Obama was given how further left he is.

Now I'm disappointed it's another lesser of two evils elections where we're stuck with Hillary Nixon and Donald Mussolini in November...

Look at it this way: Bernie might bow out this week, but never let that sway you from who's on the down ballot. Who you vote for in the Senate, House and your local gov't is more effective than who you're voting for in the White House. That's where your vote matters the most anyway.

"I feel though like this would give people better body image if this was accepted here in the States.

Personally, I need to be doing something with my free time, otherwise it will feel like my life is lacking. Recently, I've been feeling... stagnant. I'm working on trying new things and I understand it's not so easy that anyone can do it. It's perfectly normal if you don't feel right changing aspects of your life. Your life is what you are used to and it's ok to feel wrong about stepping out of your comfort zone, that's the whole definition of it.

But saying ""yo, go out and make new friends"" is not the right answer, if there is any. You can't do it that easily. Try a new hobby, preferably one where you can interact with new people with common interests, sure. Sounds great! Awesome advice. Go out and make new friends? Not really. "
"Precisely. Historically, the US hasn't had the same traumatic experiences with nationalism that Europe has-- not yet, at least. It's not that America hasn't had nationalist movements before, but they haven't ended in such a way that scarred the national psyche (ex. Hitler). 

Different experiences that make us perceive things different ways. Imagery that is heavily reminiscent of dictatorships to a European may seem like simple patriotism to an American. I was in a film class once with some European students and some American students: one scene involved people at a riot being arrested by police and put on abandoned train cars because backup hadn't arrived yet. The European students immediately recognized the train = being taken to concentration camps metaphor. The Americans didn't catch it at all. 

  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ without going into my personal thoughts on whether the pledge is good/bad, it makes sense to me why it's not seen as creepy to Americans as it is to people abroad "

"/u/Proditus has written a pretty good answer about subs, so I'll write one about companies.

The company I work with right now has a webhost with easy scaling and with volume alerting (I don't know the right terms), basically meaning that their site wont go offline under the extra demand and that ""the right people"" would get notified of any significant increases. Mostly that would be due to e.g. DDoS attacks, but a viral link could presumably trigger the same response.

Second part is that key staff (including web dev and social media people) have overtime written into their contracts so that they can be called up at short notice to respond. Most notably this was used in a criminal blackmail attempt that hit the headlines here, which affected both my company and industry as a whole. There was lots of evening and weekend work for lots of people to respond to that!"

I was waiting for customers to check out but I didn't consider that nothing. I considered that part of the job.  I was hired to be a cashier so that's what I'm doing.  That's not to say that if a manager came up to me and asked for my help with something, I wouldn't do it.  It's just that if I'm hired for a job, I want to do that particular job.  And I know that's unrealistic but that's how my brain works.

"I always find this line of reasoning interesting. The assumption that poor mothers are having more children just to get another welfare check. 

Perhaps it's true. Perhaps there are loads of women thinking that the easiest way to get a little more money is to bear a child for nine months, risk their life in child birth, then care for a new born for a year (about the hardest thing to do even for capable people with help). For what? An extra couple hundred US Dollars a month?

I doubt that. I have close relatives that are well off, don't enjoy the work they do (which is little of it now), and didn't have fulfilling hobbies. They had kids because they were unfulfilled in life. And boy did it work! They are in LOVE with their daughter. They are new people. They said that life would have been incomplete without having a kid. They are having another and I'm super excited for them and for me.

So why are poor people so different? Poor people often have shitty, boring lives (though not always, visit Appalachia for a good time with some poor folks, they can turn a tire swing over a mud pit into a weekend worth of fun). Why would children be any less fulfilling for them? Maybe it's even more central to their lives, seeing as vacations and degrees and new car purchases are out of reach. We complain about poor people not working more, but they have so much less INCENTIVE to work because they get paid such shit. The joys of parental love are probably more important when you have nothing else going for you. 

Does a poor woman having her third child cry with joy and love and overwhelm (and those crazy fucking hormones) when she sees her child? Or does she just check to see if it's alive so she can file for another check?

And let's not forget that condoms break, after a few drinks bad decisions are made at all economic levels, and abortions are a tough decision for most people. 

There's another point to make about the premise that a poor mother ""can't afford the ones they have already"". Middle class and wealthy people assume the cost of toys, clothes, a new bed and even college degrees are included with the budget for another kid. But if those things are already out of reach for the first 3 kids, the marginal cost of food for the fourth is probably manageable. 

I've gone on and on. And I've simplified the situation almost as much as others have. I haven't even touched on the false Malthusian assumptions, how droves of less educated young people are what a lot of rich countries actually need economically (especially the over-educated USA), or even the assumption that poor people are on some sort of welfare (seriously, how sure are you? Maybe your poor neighbors are making it work on their own and could care less that they LOOK to you like they are on the dole). And Jesus Christ, if we start telling people they don't have reproductive rights because we want to lower the marginal tax rates, what the fuck kind of freedom are we committed to?

But I want you to imagine for a minute an amoral view of the situation (by that I mean a view without judgement). Set aside the Protestant work ethic temporarily. Imagine poor people are ALLOWED to be poor. They don't owe it to you to work harder or be more upstanding or more presentable. It's ok that the poor exist. They MUST exist by definition. If we lived in a universe where the poor were twice as rich as they are now, they'd still be fucking poor! And the bizzarro you would be just as annoyed with them for having their FIRST kid that they couldn't afford to send to college. 

I'm not saying you're wrong about EVERY poor person. There's gotta be plenty who are entitled and just gaming the system. But there's got to be a lot who are hard working and happy or down on their luck. And there's just a lot who suck at living in the times we live in. Just as yours truly (who is fucking killing it in this world made for tall white guys who can sit at a desk 40 hours a week, charm his superiors and somehow convince anyone to hire him) probably would have had his ass handed to him if he'd been born at any other time in history.

Do you not trust me enough to talk about it? Is it because you feel like society says men can't be sensitive? If you think that, why not defy society? I'm honestly confused. 

Also, a guy friend of mine said it's harder for men to get over their ex than it is for women? Is this true for other men, or just him? If it's true, why do you think that is? 

Thank you for answering our questions. "
"yep.  we are trained by women to act like we don't want to talk to them.

some women are most interested in us when we ignore them or treat them like we are only mildly interested in them.      If we show too much interest, they pull away and lose interest in us.

 makes no logical sense, but we get trained on that at a fairly young age.

"Battery farms; y'know, like the big egg company farms that cram their hens into tiny cages and force-molt them. It's extremely cruel. Chickens thrive with access to the outdoors. Not only do the quality of their lives improve, but their eggs, too. Hens in battery cages are pale, plucked bare in some spots, and in some cases may have their upper beak cut because they get so stressed out and under-stimulated they start to reach through their cages and cannibalize each other. 

Some larger commercial farms *do* treat their hens well and let them have access to the outdoors. Wilcox Farms in the Northwest US, for instance. And of course, people who raise their own birds. If I'm not mistaken, some places have already banned battery cages.

Similarly, farms that cram milking cows into little cages for non-veterinarian purposes. And the way some places treat meat chickens (the difference between a meat chicken raised outdoors and allowed to live like a chicken and a meat chicken crammed into a crowded warehouse for its entire life is huge - as much as I adore chickens, free range meat is delicious; I think it really honors the animal)."

"Oh my god, I did something similar to this.  So in 5th grade, in my math class, I sat next to this moronic kid that would always forget his homework and do poorly on tests.  But for some reason he had a TON of these pink tickets (raffle tickets that the teacher would let you turn in on Fridays to be pulled to get some candy. Also looking back on it now, it's obvious he stole them from other kids' desks) so one day he offered to give me all his raffle tickets, if I did one homework assignment for him.  Of course I did it.  I got the raffle tickets, erased the names that were on it (he gave me some BS excuse as why there were other names on it) and turned them into the raffle box in my teacher's classroom.  For the rest of the year, I got called every single Friday to get some candy, when she would only take 5 ish tickets out of the box.    Here comes the one time I almost got caught.  So the teacher was lazy and had a student pick out the tickets and read off the names.  One of the times, the teacher walked up to the front before the other student had thrown them away and the teacher picked up my raffle ticket.  I guess some of the ones the kid gave me weren't exactly the same, and the teacher noticed and asked if she ever gave out those tickets.  Another student then said, that she did on a specific day and the teacher believed her.  That girl saved my ass, thank you wherever you are.  "

Well, jealous best friend is still jealous, and purposefully doesn't invite me to any social gatherings to assure that I can't get with her man. They just got back together though so I'm allowed in the circle again, phew.

Moral of the story: this rule sucks because despite my flagrant gayness my best friend still didn't trust me and that really hurt :("

"I don't know her personally, but my mom has a cousin who lives in Colorado and is part of a small religious community. Apparently, their life is completely restricted until the age of 15, then they are completely free to do whatever. Some odd things I have heard are:  

* They are not allowed to do ANYTHING sexual whatsoever, however they have 12 cheat days a year. Basically, you pick your days you want to touch yourself...and they have no problem with this.  

* They have mass in the complete nude. Not joking.  

* The weirdest one I have heard, apparently there is a ritual where when the kids reach 15 years old, they have a party of some sort and everybody takes hallucinogenic drugs.  

* The icing on the cake -- they are not allowed to know the name of the religion before 15. So creepy.  

I wish I could say I was making this up, but I am not. There may be more details, but my mother doesn't like to talk about it a lot. Definitely the weirdest thing I have ever heard a family do.

"Most blood transfusions are PRBC or packed red blood cells. That means that most of the plasma and WBCs have been removed and it's just concentrated RBC's. An RBC has little to no DNA. It is essentially a bag full of hemoglobin and pretty much nothing else. 

Based on blood typing, the blood you get will always be compatible with you, so it's likely to be your same blood type (determined by cell proteins on the outside of the cell) but you won't have any significant DNA from someone else. 

The main reason why WBCs are filtered out is that they are the primary reason for transfusion related reactions like fevers. Now, if you were to get a whole blood transfusion (which is rare in the US and the only time I've ever seen it done is in the movies), there will be DNA transferred, but your body will go out of its way to find that DNA and destroy it.

We waited until we got to my grandmothers house around the block, once inside they proceeded to show me a notebook they found in his room. Inside he had wrote out every girls name in our high school that encompasses our grade and the ones above and below us. Beside each name he had rated them from 1-10 and what sexual acts he would do to them. Some pretty fucked up shit was in that book"

"I'm sure there's a level that can be unhealthy but to me it feels zen to clean.  You're not worrying about the world, you're just focused on doing a single task to perfection.  

And it's a lot easier and less time consuming to keep something clean than it is to clean something that is messy.  And there are SOOOO many benefits.  I sweep my house every morning, and I love it.  It's the perfect way to wake up and I can walk around barefoot without getting any dirt, dust, or anything on my feet.  I clean my kitchen while I cook, so it's always clean.

&gt; I was a prototype for Echelon IV. My instructions are to amuse visitors with information about themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; JC DENTON
&gt; I don't see anything amusing about spying on people.
&gt; 
&gt; MORPHEUS
&gt; Human beings feel pleasure when they are watched. I have recorded their smiles as I tell them who they are.
&gt; 
&gt; JC DENTON
&gt; Some people just don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance.
&gt; 
&gt; MORPHEUS
&gt; The need to be observed and understood was once satisfied by God. Now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms.
&gt; 
&gt; JC DENTON
&gt; Electronic surveillance hardly inspired reverence. Perhaps fear and obedience, but not reverence.
&gt; 
&gt; MORPHEUS
&gt; God and the gods were apparitions of observation, judgment, and punishment. Other sentiments toward them were secondary.
&gt; 
&gt; JC DENTON
&gt; No one will ever worship a software entity peering at them through a camera.
&gt; 
&gt; MORPHEUS
&gt; The human organism always worships. First it was the gods, then it was fame (the observation and judgment of others), next it will be the self-aware systems you have built to realize truly omnipresent observation and judgment.
&gt; 
&gt; JC DENTON
&gt; You underestimate humankind's love of freedom.
&gt; 
&gt; MORPHEUS
&gt; The individual desires judgment. Without that desire, the cohesion of groups is impossible, and so is civilization.
&gt; 
&gt; The human being created civilization not because of a willingness but because of a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning. God was a dream of good government.
&gt; 
&gt; You will soon have your God, and you will make it with your own hands.

"They aren't meant to replace actual baby carrots, they're meant to make use of misshapen or ""ugly"" carrots that wouldn't be sold in grocery stores. They actually cut down on food waste by a tremendous amount. The industry used to sell less than half of the carrots grown, now it's significantly more. Plus their appearance in the market has increased the amount of carrots eaten by children and adults alike, and that's a way better snack option than most other choices. "

"I only think that's true if you're looking at it from the perspective of a teenage boy's fantasy. He literally meets Yen, thinks she's super hot, then wishes for a genie to bond them together. She only cares about him when he's telling her how awesome she is or she needs something from him. Dumping her (and the quest that allows you to do so) was an amazing moment for Geralt as I saw it. He finally moved on from the classically flawed relationship he started in a more immature place in life and on to someone with whom he actually has an interest in. His passion for Yen was always based on his base obsession, never on actual affection. They just liked fucking on that unicorn.

Tbh, the story that plays out if you leave Yen for Triss is my favorite romance in any game ever simply BECAUSE it's not based on flirting/high school feelings. It's actual mature development."

"Here's my time to shine!

We cohabited during college and were arguing.  I needed to leave the apartment before I lost my cool, and she wouldn't give me my car keys so I could leave.  She then began throwing stuff at me, so I hid in the bedroom.  She was trying force her way into the bedroom, and I was bracing the door to prevent her from coming in.  She ended up with a bruised arm and shoulder from trying to force her way in, and then the next day told her friends that I had hit her (which I didn't). 

That was when it finally occurred to me that she wasn't the victim - I was. 

Come to think of it, I think of it..I heard through the grapevine she's actually getting married this weekend.  I feel sorry for the future groom."
"Unwanted sex can also poke at past scars of sexual abuse, which even though Reddit won't appreciate me saying, a *lot* of women (and men) have experienced.  Even women who aren't yet really fully cognizant of their past unhealthy or abusive sexual encounters can still connect on an emotional level what she is experiencing now with a person she loves and what she has experienced in the past. Especially if she hasn't been able to cope with her trauma effectively. And these connections can do really solid damage to an otherwise amazing relationship. 

Sorry to speak in terms of a female perspective but I am speaking of my own experience. "

"Put my Benz on CL for $2000.  This tweaker calling himself Peter Parker shows up with $1000 cash and asks ""can I give you this grand now , then take the car and pay you later?""  I said ,"" fuck no sir , but I'll gladly hold your grand while you get the rest and I'll give you the car once you return with the other grand.""  For some strange tweaker reason he agrees to this .  

I'm a good guy (for the most part) so I wait for him to return .  Days go by and none of his phone numbers work except one which is a motel an hour away.  So I said fuck it and put the car back on CL .  I find a buyer and they pay me the $$$ we agreed on and life goes on.  I essentially sold the car twice.

Flash forward about 50 days or so and I get a call from the cops saying some guy named Peter Parker has accused me of stealing his car and money.  I flat out tell the cops the story and also inform them that the $1000 is long gone because I never thought I'd hear from him again.  

They were like ""hmmmm..  Well is anything in writing ? "". I say ""nope .""  And the cops like "" well , well ask him if he wants to take you to court over it but as far as we're concerned you didn't steal anything - he gave you money and never got the car and its history.  Also we have problems with this guy all the time so let's just move on"".

"Nobody would confiscate all guns because nobody could. So what they do is they slowly take them away, piece by piece, so that you don't even realize that it's happening. After every tragedy lawmakers make a push with the full support of the media.

-First they take away fully automatic weapons, that's reasonable right?

-Then magazines over 10 rounds, who needs that?

-Then flash suppressors, silencers, and limit the number of accessories you can have.

-Then they set up a licensing program, where you have to take this class, and then pay this fee, and have these documents, and then speak with this Captain of the police department. Because after all it's reasonable to require training and inform the police department if there is a gun in the house.

-Then they ban certain firearms simply because of their brand or because they look scary.

-Then they separate the state into green, red, and black area's based on crime. If you live in a green zone you can still get your dumbed-down gun after you go through all of the necessary certifications and paperwork of course, and then waiting 2-4 months for everything to be processed. In a red town they may only limit you to a hunting license or a restricted license. But a black town? Good luck. But its ok they didn't ban guns for the whole state, just the black towns where there is a lot of crime. That is reasonable isn't it?

No it wouldn't. Your workload would just increase, and you'd just end up doing more work for the same pay. That's the game. Employers want you to do as much work as possible for as little pay as possible. You want to do as little work possible for as much pay as possible. That's why you don't go to your boss at 11 am and ask what else you can help with for the rest of the day. And that's why your boss doesn't constantly ask you if you're happy with your pay. You could always do more work for your company and your company could always pay you more, but a balance was struck and until something changes, it's likely to remain that way."

- Confronted at my seat that ""I'm sure your ticket sends you to the back of the aircraft, this is business class"".

- Waiting in the check-in line for business and some douche nozzle in a suit tells me ""hey, this is the business line, get out of here"". To which I always reply ""Oh? Thanks for letting me know I'm in the right line. For a second I thought I was going blind.""

You play a member of what is essentially a SWAT team for ghosts and the otherwise paranormal, chasing down a particularly violent poltergeist.

The ghosts/enemies encountered in the game have outrageously broken abilities such as being able to dissolve, implode, quarter and/or otherwise fatally maim members of the FEAR team. Oh, and they're pretty much invincible - AND usually invisible as well.

Just about every time you hear, ""does anyone have a position on Staff Sergeant  __________?"" you can rest assured that you'll find the unlucky officer's bones and entrails sloshed all over the walls in the rooms adjacent to the ones with the next big enemy waiting (probably invisibly) inside.

One night, during a particularly stressful boss encounter, the screen went entirely black as though the monitor had died. I got up to check it out, and the screen came back to life while I was away from my controller. It was so unexpected, and of course I didn't make it back in time to save myself from getting eviscerated in just the worst ways (and I say this as a guy who loves Mortal Kombat).

Oh yeah, did I mention? Bullets do nothing to the paranormal entities - they're only good for taking out the human(oid?) enemies who, for some reason, think they can do anything as or more effective than their boss's moves such as ""explode their face through the front and back of their skull with no warning"".

Other times, the game perfectly recreates those dreams we all have where there's an incredibly powerful and malevolent monster coming to get you, but you just....can't....run....fast enough. It was like moving through jello, or as if there were suddenly no ""run"" or ""sprint"" functions in Fallout - but ONLY when you run into Deathclaws or Behemoths.

The game would randomly invert the controller's X and Y axes during particularly high-stress moments.

Those intentional glitches happened often enough - and were unsettling enough - for me to finally give it the old ""NOPE"" rating, and I haven't played since.

That was about eight years ago."
"I've had something similar happened to me and I hated how I reacted as the victim.

Except one day I heard this kid stand up for me right infront of his friends and I could tell it was sincere. He walked with me for a few seconds apologising for his friends and I just harshly shrugged him away with words. I've always looked back and felt such a dick for doing that. I wish I could've gone back and tell him how amazing he is."

This is also an issue for all genders, men who are raped by women for example are often told ""why didn't you just push her off"" etc.

"I'm 5'4"" and pretty close to the ocean, so I'd say about 105' and 4"".  But it depends on what you mean by ""You""... what are we?  And at what point are we?  And what is distance....?  Fuck man... distance fucks with me sometimes.  Like... imagine you have your right hand up in your face.  And you move it to the left.  Then you move it back.  Is that still your same hand...?  Wait... leave ""your"" out of it because we never did figure that part out.  So, is it still THE same hand?  Like, imagine a wave.  It starts waaaay back in the ocean somewhere.  And I'm like chillin, waiting for it in the water.  And I see it coming at me.  But WHAT is coming at me?  The water that comprises the wave is still really, really far out, but there's the wave, getting closer.  And as it gets closer, the new water that comprises the wave is left behind by new water in the wave.  So where is the damn wave?  Is it the water?  The force pushing the water?  What if the hand is the same thing.  Like there's a water equivalent to ""space"" and ""matter"".  And when you move your hand, you're not moving anything solid at all.  Your hand is exactly like a wave, moving through and ocean of ""space"" and ""matter"".  So when you move your hand from the right to the left then back, it's not the same hand... I guess.  I mean, it is.  Just like a moving wave is always the same wave.  But the thing that gives it form is constantly being left behind.  Just like the water is left behind as the wave moves.  We are all just ripples from the big band... like a wave in the ocean.  We are matter in space.

Ummmm so yeah.  I guess I'm pretty high.  Cuz 105' 4"" is really far from somewhere.  But really close to me.  So I guess I'm not high at all.  Fuck man... you're question is seriously throwing me for a loop."

If you came upon her in the forest while lost and she found you evil, she would curse you. Or worse, eat you. But if she found you pure, she would guide you out of the forest. And maybe even bless you with a charm. 

Plus, her name is fun to say out loud. Baba Yaga.

"So lets say that being transgender is actually a mental disorder. Even if it is, surgery and being able to live as your preferred gender makes people a lot happier then therapy, which has proven negative effects. It basically produces the same results as gay conversion therapy, so just more stress and depression. So shouldn't we allow these people to live happy lives? Maybe some day a ""cure"" is discovered, then people can use that. But for now, the best results happen by letting people become the gender they feel like they are. "
"This is the exact side of the argument that still bothers me about casual sex. I never could come up with an answer that I deemed reasonable enough to argue against this - really, how *do* you know if you've never tried?

When my first girlfriend left me for casual sex a long time ago (or rather the prospect of exploring her sexuality), this was her main argument against why I shouldn't be so opposed to it. She tried opening up our relationship, but I was in no way secure enough for that and steadily turned down the proposition.

I eventually relented and gave her the green light to do whatever/whomever the fuck she wants, just so that I could keep her happy and in my life as my SO... This was not a healthy move on my end.

I found myself becoming more and more jealous as the weeks went on and more and more frequently would I hear her talk about the guys she'd made out with at clubs and how well they kissed her.

This tore me apart.

The somewhat shameful part of all this is that I did try to be okay with it. I forced myself into trying out the casual scene for a bit to try and salvage our (retrospectively unhealthy) relationship, but it only took one hookup to really solidify my aversion to the trend.

I honestly wish I could say that I felt some sort of guilt for my gf, turning me off to the idea of hurting her feelings, but *really* what it was, was my insecurity in losing her to someone else, just another random guy out of nowhere.

So, how do you **just know**?

"Well.. Said friend had an uncle who did some digging for construction on an old graveyard, and these bones was found. He is a metal-head, so I guess he thought having real human remains  was pretty metal. When he moved out, he asked if I wanted them, because I am interested in anatomy and because I previously had bought a full size skeleton from the internet while drunk (my logic was that I was lonely and needed a room-mate).
So now I have a bag of bones which has been laying around for ever, and I just have no idea what to do with them, since some questions obviously will be asked and I don't want police involved or anything, I really don't have the nerves for that. I was thinking of just dropping the guy off at the nearby church, but.. I don't know.

Once I started to shave my legs it became more inconvenient.  My baby brother would shower with one of my parents.  My other brother liked his privacy- it was a personality thing he was nearly born with- so he always demanded his space and to do his own laundry separately as soon as he was old enough and fix his own plates at meals and such.  So we tried to accommodate him.  But I'm not going to piss my pants when he has been in the shower forever.

"Hmmmm...I don't remember the first time I found out I was *into* it, mainly because I'm pretty sure I was born with mine. I get super turned on by hiccups. To the point where it's a fetish as defined by somewhat dubious science (meaning, it's something I just can't cum without it being involved somehow). Everything about them just drives me crazy. The embarrassed little giggle after loud ones, the way the neck caves in, seeing the chest jerk and their whole body lift up if they're upright, or seeing them rock back with the force...

And oh lord, *bellies!* Bellies with hiccups are just...nnngh. The way a person's belly moves when they hiccup, especially if the hiccups are really strong and they're laying down. Just seeing the way it bounces, or seeing the motion roll through their whole torso...or if they're strong enough, seeing them lift their whole body off wherever they're lying...oooohhhhhhlord. My biggest fantasy is to straddle someone's belly while they're hiccuping, maybe with a dildo in one or both holes, and just press my clit to their stomach and fffffeeel it.

What took me longer wasn't to realize that I had a thing for hiccups, but to figure out what the hell that ""thing"" was. I grew up in a conservative catholic household where I didn't know what a dick was until I was 14. So it took me an embarrassingly long time to understand why I didn't want anyone to know what I was googling.

Last thing: DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND HICCUP PORN I HAVEN'T READ? I've literally been looking through the archives since I was old enough to use google and there is NOTHING LEFT! And, for whatever reason, my own stuff just isn't that hot to me. Can't explain it.

Because of this issue, I've developed a whole lot of what I call ""Satellite kinks"". Basically, kinks that I only developed out of ""orbit"" from the main one. Essentially, I'm starving for pornography, so anything that can even be tangentially related to hiccups, I've probably jerked it to, and a few became things I started liking on their own merits. The big (heh, big) ones are inflation, stuffing, and other sorts of belly play for me, as is probably obvious.

The older definition of the word pretty much is just ""small religion"" or ""portion of a larger religion focused around a single entity or object."" Which is why you'll sometimes hear about ancient cults having been centered around major Roman or Greek gods at a time when they were major parts of a major religion."

It is worth remembering that until recently Alamo was run by an independent organization called The Daughters of the Republic of Texas.

"Bang on, it really was a massive fuck up. In contrast Fujifilm did superb and innovated well. I actually have some notes, and some interesting quotes on this from some research I did on this in relation to innovation. 

'It built one of the first digital cameras in 1975. That technology, followed by the development of smartphones that double as cameras, has battered Kodak's old film- and camera-making business almost to death'

'Strange to recall, Kodak was the Google of its day. Founded in 1880, it was known for its pioneering technology and innovative marketing.'
You press the button, we do the rest,” was its slogan in 1888.'

'Bad luck played a role, too. Kodak thought that the thousands of chemicals its researchers had created for use in film might instead be turned into drugs. But its pharmaceutical operations fizzled, and were sold in the 1990s.'

'Kodak also failed to read emerging markets correctly. It hoped that the new Chinese middle class would buy lots of film. They did for a short while, but then decided that digital cameras were cooler. Many leap-frogged from no camera straight to a digital one.'

"They didn't handle the situation well.  The way the girl at the counter talked to me made it seem like it could have been me that stole it.  I didn't like her offensive tone at all.  Or maybe they saw all their customers as one entity and it was a us vs them type of mentality.  Or maybe it was just an lame excuse to stop using the cards.  One thing they didn't account for sure was how getting rid of the loyalty cards probably affected people's decision to come back.  Anyway, I'm just guessing the reason why a lot of other people stopped going there based on my decision to not return."
"Agreed. Everything gets easier as you get older. You have more skills, experiences and resources to manage the demands of life. Things that used to stress you out become background noise that you tend to without undue worry.  You develop a more balanced perspective and it is much easier to find and experience happiness on a daily basis. 

One really interesting side effect of aging is that your perspective on time totally changes. You may hit 30, 40 or 50 but your personal experience of who you are as a person does not change all that much.  You get a bit more patient and wiser, but you are essentially the same you that you became in your late teens/early 20s.  Sometimes it is shocking to look in a mirror and see an older you staring back rather than the 22 year old you still feel like. 

You also gain an appreciation for how long life is and for how incredibly long a person stays ‘young’. I have met 70 year olds that can run laps around 30 something’s and 90 year olds who are still actively farming and running businesses. These people are my heroes. 

For me every decade that goes by is like a new chapter in a book. I learn new things, make new friends, travel to new places, and develop new hobbies. Each decade has been my 'best' decade and I expect that trend to continue. I will be turning 50 this summer and I don’t feel old at all.  I started learning piano at the beginning of this month so that I can play a simple song for myself as a 50th birthday gift. I always wanted to learn the piano and now I have enough time, enough patience and enough money to do that. As an older adult, life is GOOD!

"First, some background: like 1.5 years ago, my boyfriend at the time cheated on me with a friend of mine. These are the two people in question.

My ex messaged me a few weeks ago, pretending to want to be friends with me, but really just wanting to badmouth his current girlfriend. Telling me that she sleeps around with other guys, that he found herpes medication in her bag, that she's abusive and punches him, etc. And he explicitly said that *he hoped I'd gossip about this to other people* (despite me living thousands of miles away now). You know, because girls are catty, or whatever. (Instead, I told him to fuck off, because he's a terrible human being.)

Later, *his girlfriend messaged me from his account,* trying to clarify things and calling him insane.

I told her that none of this was my business, and wished her luck in her relationship. That made her really mad, for some reason.

They're both mid-30s, and this isn't even the most insane story about them, by far. They're still together after like 18 months of solid drama and shit worse than this. I guess that's true romance?

"His name is Eric Moussambani, and he had a singular dream - to swim, and swim well. Eric hails from the country of Equatorial Guinea, a place I'm sure many of you have never heard of. Located in Central Africa, its a country that is more likely to produce excellent sprinters or perhaps even soccer (football) players, but not necessarily famed swimmers. Still, Eric dreamed of a grander life and he thought (I'm sure) ""hey, this swimming thing probably isn't too hard). So 8 months before 2008 Summer Olympics Eric began to train for the 100m freestyle.

Eric did not qualify for the event, but through the magics of the Olympic Wildcards, he was given entry. It was a big deal for Eric; he got to go to Sydney, he saw his first Olympic sized swimming pool, and he was competing with the best of the best. At this point I'm sure he was just elated to be there, the chance of actually winning was a moon shot, and yet, somehow, God looked down on Eric that day and said ""Pull up your socks son, I'm blessing the fuck out of you today"".

His two competitors made the fatal mistake of a false start - jumping into the pool before the signal was given, and were immediately disqualified. Eric swam unopposed, the pool all to himself, and he finished with an abysmal time (for professional swimmers) of one minute and 52 seconds. Eric became briefly famous for the event, but it faded away like the waves in water. He did not participate in the 2004 or 2008 Olympics, and as of 2012 serves as the Equatorial Guinea swim coach.

There was another competitor from Equatorial Guinea also competing that year - Paula Barila Bolopa, she competed in the 50m free style and completed with a time of 1 minute 3 seconds, the worst time in Olympic history. 

Despite their failures, both were exemplary athletes, and performed to the best of their ability.

If I go to the pub for a quiet pint after work, I don't necessarily want to have conversations with people, and I'm too polite to stop someone in their tracks and tell them to leave me alone. So generally I'll just go somewhere else to duck all that social shit.

It's nice knowing people that work there and being friendly with the staff, but it's different to them being your friends a bit. It also feels like a bit of a reflection on yourself when you go to a pub or a fastfood place and everyone knows you and what you eat and drink it's like ''Fuck am I really that unhealthy and predictable that my terrible habits and diet are like fucking clockwork?'' At least with pubs once you're a regular enough you get a bit of discount on drinks and shit in most places though. "

"But I also think there is a huge percentage of the population that only drives because they have to (myself and my wife included). We live in the city of chicago, and only drive when absolutely necessary, or when we visit my family in Ohio. 

We would buy a self-driving car in a HEART beat. Suddenly, trips to the suburbs to visit clients don't mean sitting in bumper to bumper traffic and starting at the car in front of me wanting to kill myself. It means I get to be on my laptop the whole time, actually working (or, more likely, redditing). 

When we go on roadtrips, its not switching off driving every couple hours so that the other can have a break and goof off on their phone, take a nap, or read - we can *both* be doing that the *entire time*. 

Not to mention the increased safety for everyone, not just drivers but pedestrians, as more people take the dive into self driving cars. Plus many of them are going to be electric, so emissions will drastically lower. 

Goods will be cheaper, because long-haul trucks are driving themselves. Fewer wrecks, means cheaper insurance for everyone. 

Barring some solar flare knocking out GPS and bricking every self-driving car, I can't see anything but good coming from these becoming the norm. 

Plus, you can still manually drive them, so people who like driving for relaxation or whatever still can. "

"I live in a big city so I frequently use Uber.  If you're unfamiliar with Uber, it's an app where you can request for a car to pick you up at any location within minutes and then drop you off at your destination, kind of like an on-demand cab.  When you're requesting the car, the app lets you know how long the wait will be, usually anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes.  Today, I wanted to smoke a cigarette before I requested an Uber, but when I went to request the car they were all within 2 - 3 minutes of where I was waiting.  My first world problem was literally that the car was too conveniently located for me to smoke first.   "

My uncle and his friends ended up sprinting across no-man's-land towards the American checkpoint with 5 minutes left 'till curfew. They made it with just a couple minutes to spare, and the US guard said that if they got caught out in no-man's-land after curfew, the Soviet guards would've gunned them down from the Wall."

"Nah it isn't the same. While anime may have examples like One Punch Man that buck a lot of trends, it is by far more uniform than anything you mentioned. There are attributes very common to anime that are nothing to do with the medium, most notably (for me) the lack of subtlety in which characters thoughts and feelings are conveyed. Even good ones like Hunter x Hunter still have freeze frames where character internally narrate their feelings towards each other so that the audience gets it, plus the eventual fate of a certain person who is very good at hide and seek, was conveyed entirely visually despite being a psychological outcome.

Not saying it's all the same. But generalising anime is by *far* more fair than music or movies. It is undeniably more narrow and trope ridden overall, especially compared to music."

"My answer too. Goes hand in hand with people who can't ever admit they screwed up or were wrong.

I'll take someone who says 'sorry' too much over someone who can't say it at all any day.

Its such a simple thing. But it's important to me because saying sorry shows a person can prioritize another person's feelings over their own ego.

On the flip side: being able to say, 'I appreciate you saying that. I forgive you. Its over. I'm past it. What do you want for lunch?' is equally important. Forgiveness is essential to any good relationship-- friendship, familial, or romantic.

"On the other hand, it's a shame that Paris gets most the tourism traffic for France, because the rest of the country is amazing.

Still, Paris is an amazing destination, but you need to know why you go there. If you go to there to enjoy the french way of life, you're gonna have a hard time : even french people hate the life in Paris. If you go for the museums and the architecture, you're gonna have a blast. It's definitely not overrated as one of the most beautiful city in the world (I'm talking about the center, obviously not the periphery), and there's some of the best museums in the world here (I'm not talking only about the Louvre).

If what you love is the big towns, you should go to Bordeaux, often described as ""Paris, but smaller"". For me, ""Paris, but more quiet"" is a better description. You'll find here everything you'd find in Paris, but without having to go to Paris : a beautiful architecture, nice museums, nice restaurants, lots of shopping to do.

But my personnal recommendation is simply to go to medium cities. France is an absolutely gorgeous country all around. Choose a region, pick a medium-sized town randomly in that region and go there. Every region of France has a gorgeous countryside, and any town in France has a beautiful historic center.

When it comes to food, Paris has the best high-end restaurants (even if Bordeaux is getting up there, these days), but for affordable restaurants you'll get the exact same quality anywhere else (but cheaper, precisely because it's less crowded)."

"I work for a family law firm and we handle paternity cases all the time. I honestly don't see why a DNA test isn't mandatory to put a man on the birth certificate seeing how many problems it causes down the road for both parties involved as well as the state with tying up the court systems when the father tries to fight it or the mother goes after him for support. 

We even see a lot of cases where the biological father finds out he has a child and does want to be a father but has a difficult time getting rights because the mother got another man to put his name on the birth certificate. It just seems like it would solve a lot of problems for everyone in the long run, though I'm sure quite a few divorces may result from it. "

Now, had the lady on the phone handled this any differently they may have still had a sale. What does she do instead of asking us if we're still interested? She just tells us we'll have to come in and pick a different bed. You don't even ask us how we want to handle this? You just *assume* we spent those two hours looking through beds for shits and giggles and we'll just take any old bed you have? No way lady. She wasn't pleased when we cancelled our order.

Worked out though, cause we went online and actually did some research. Ended up with a Casper that was literally a fraction of the cost, larger, and much more of what we wanted."

"From my understanding in China, the one child rule made it hard for chinese family. Typically men want their surname to carry on for honor or whatever. This is only done through male lines, and when you have a 1 child rule, and your first child is a girl, the men are disappointed, and uneducated people will instantly blame the baby making factory that is their wife. (without realising that the male sperm determines gender of child.)

So they quietly dispose of baby girls and try again. My Aunt adopted three asian children while in Singapore, her first was a girl that was simply left on a church door step.

In India, I suspect (but cannot confirm) that it's purely driven by women being second class citizens with no rights. Men can work fields etc, and are ""worth more"" to the family as a whole. Men can potentially get a better job and bring in more income for the family.

Now yes, if the society was thinking as a societal collective, they would insure that there was females in their society, but people think as individuals, and if you have a girl, but want a boy, dispose of the girl and try again, and who gives a damn about gender imbalance in 20 years, I want a boy dammit! When everyone thinks that, you get a fucked up society... like  how China has a severe imbalance now...

"I had a roommate who was convinced that he was a better driver when he was drunk.  Convinced.  And then one day, finally, he jumped a median in a parking lot at like 32 miles per hour.  Hahahahah.  Fuckin' dumbass."
"Unfortunately I used to be this asshole. It started with having 2 or 3 beers and being fine. Then occasionally having 4, then 5, then 6, etc. It happened over the course of years, but eventually I got to the point where I was driving drunk quite often. I didn't go around exclaiming that I was a great drunk driver, but based off my actions I might as well have. 

I moved overseas and didn't have a car for a year. Now that I'm driving again I'm taking it very seriously. It's just a stupid thing that is easily avoided. It doesn't matter how many times you're successful, all that matters is the time you aren't. "

"This. I live in a rural area and own guns. I'm probably here now because I do. A few years back I was home sick when a van pulled in the drive... long story short, there had been some daytime break-ins and that day was my ""lucky day"". I thought maybe they were just lost, but their demeanor was that of casing the place. I called 911 (it took 25 min for them to arrive) and when the drive got out of the van, I went to the door (gun out of site but next to me) and asked if I could help him. Immediately he looked back at the van and two other guys get out. I'm thinking ok..wtf. So I pull the shotgun out, and again asked ""can I help you"". Those guys took off...  I got a description of the van, but no plate cause I didn't have my contacts in. It fit the description of a van spotted near some other break-ins.  Self defense is a thing and it's important. Unless you've been face with having to do it, I don't think you can just discount it.. there are lots of nut-jobs and people out there that would just a soon kill you as look at you."

"2 days. I started a job at a coffee shop. The first day was mostly spent training and observing another employee who'd been there for a while.  I watched her ring up items, pour coffee and serve pastries. Pretty simple stuff, really. On the second day, I showed up to learn that two of the staff, including the girl I'd been training with, had quit that morning. Apparently they had a long-standing beef with the manager and were fed up. I was the only employee left that day, so my manager and I had to handle the enormous morning crowd of groggy customers looking for their caffeine fix. I learned pretty quickly that the manager was a real prick. 2 hours into my shift, and he'd already yelled at me in front of customers about half a dozen times. He yelled at me for doing things wrong that I didn't even know were wrong. I gave one customer back 10 cents too much and he told me I was going to bankrupt the place. Finally, I'd had enough and as I was going on my lunch break, I told my manager that he could politely go fuck himself. He fired me on the spot for my cheekiness and because I'd spent a good portion of my shift blowing dicks like a fiend in a back alley for coke. I was happy to be rid of that job. Seeing two employees quit on my second day wasn't a good indication of a healthy work environment. A few years later, the manager ended up applying for a job at a company where I was a manager. I called him in to an interview just to give him a smug look while I asked him demeaning questions about his management style. "

"That the majority of fat people are that way because they're lazy, spoiled, don't like to exercise, and they love unhealthy food and drink.

There are actually very few medical reasons to gain weight, and those people who suffer from such illnesses are often advised on how to adjust their diet to minimise this issue. So the people who become *fat* fat, or obese, are likely sick *and* unwilling to change their diet. 

A little bit of weight isn't so bad, but when you need a scooter to get around (simply *because* of your size), you're shortening your life, you're making the people that care about you miserable knowing you're going to die, and you're setting yourself up for horrendously expensive medical needs unnecessarily.

" It was the last final ever of my undergraduate career and I had studied my butt off for it. Somehow, I had gotten the time for it wrong and by the time I found out, it was already too late. I rushed to my professor's office, freaking out. He was totally cool with me taking it but for some reason, that triggered a panic attack. Cue an hour on the phone with my therapist, crying my eyes out and hyperventilating. This all took place outside. I found out that there was a class taking their final right behind me and that they had overheard and seen the entire thing. 

This is something that I have sworn never to talk about but here goes. In general, I have very irregular periods that pop up randomly without any signs (ie. bloating, cramps).

I had no idea and thought that I was just sweaty and you know, the normal increased vaginal discharge before a period. It wasn't until my instructor coughed and whispered that he thought I should go to the restroom that I discovered that I had bled through my white tae kwon do uniform. by bled through, i mean bled through. the worst part was that we were doing a lot of stretching that day which involved splits. lots and lots of splits.

"Well, some of our D&amp;D games were once held in church function rooms and libraries just to tell you how it all suddenly reversed.  I blame the whole ""Moral Majority"" movement pushed by Pat Robertson, Oral Roberts, President Reagan, Jim and Tammy Faye Baker, and the like.  Most were televangelists, most who all eventually ended up being part of some sex or money scandal.  D&amp;D was not the top of their list, but it certainly affected us gamers.

Our local Crown Books chain used to carry D&amp;D and supplements, but eventually were pressured to stop.  Before that happened, I was accosted by some woman who said I was into devil worship. I couldn't think of what to say, so I said it was probably too late, so I was going to have fun while I was still alive.  She didn't take that well at all, and asked where my parents were.  I told her at home.  She make a comment about me being alone at my age leading to me being astray, and I said I was 15 and already had a job.  I had yet to learn some people don't like being corrected.

One of our friends who had rich parents had nearly everything D&amp;D imaginable.  Then his parents decided D&amp;D was devil magic, burned all his books, and he wasn't allowed to play with us anymore.  I recall being MORTALLY offended that they chose to burn the books instead of give them away.  Heh.

A lot of TV talk shows would have an episode of D&amp;D and usually the set they had was all candlelit with people working in dark rooms, speaking in mumbling tones.   The video camera would tilt back and forth slowly fading from shot to shot, like what they thought an acid trip must look like. None of us player were like that at all; we needed bright lighting to read that damn small font TSR often used in modules.  I don't know any gaming group that used dramatic lighting; I would have laughed at any that did.

Oh god, the story about James Egbert would. not. stop. getting. airplay!  I was so SICK of that story!  That and ""Mazes and Monsters.""  It was the only two things the media had, really, and they milked that cow bone-dry.

I did press relations with a science fiction convention back then, and one reporter described our game room (a function room with gamers pretty much anyone has seen in every con ever) as a ""back room den filled with smoke and gambling.""  What smoke?  We weren't allowed to smoke in hotels.  That reporter already had an agenda, and that was a lesson learned on my part.  Lucky for me, they spelled my name wrong in the paper, too, so anyone looking for me would have a time finding me out.

The biggest thing that upset me were people would make all kinds of comments about devil worship without opening one book or attending one game.  But these people also did that with everything.  ""I don't have to read or understand anything to dislike it and declare it harmful for humanity."""

"Orville in later life was a CEO/businessman in the airplane industry (his company https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtiss-Wright is still in business technically). They manufactured all sorts of military aircraft and engines, including the P-36 fighter, so he certainly does not appear adverse to aerial warfare. 

He had this specifically to say, :

&gt; ""We dared to hope we had invented something that would bring lasting peace to the earth. But we were wrong....No, I don't have any regrets about my part in the invention of the airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses.""

After the war his company failed to transition into effective jet aircraft development, and lost most contracts and business. The company had been good at upgrades and improvements, but lagged in R&amp;D regarding new frames and jet propulsion. 

He was a statesman, and sat on various aeronautic committees and boards officially, including the NACA which later became NASA, and other organizations tied to the aeronautic industry and piloting. 


We do have a lot of his letters and correspondence that could likely deduce his personal achievements.

"Guys, you know he wrote a book about it. You don't have to speculate:

&gt; Last Friday, April 16,1943, I was forced to interrupt my work in the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon and proceed home, being affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors. After some two hours this condition faded away.

&gt;    This was, altogether, a remarkable experience—both in its sudden onset and its extraordinary course. It seemed to have resulted from some external toxic influence; I surmised a connection with the substance I had been working with at the time, lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate. But this led to another question: **how had I managed to absorb this material? Because of the known toxicity of ergot substances, I always maintained meticulously neat work habits. Possibly a bit of the LSD solution had contacted my fingertips during crystallization, and a trace of the substance was absorbed through the skin.** If LSD-25 had indeed been the cause of this bizarre experience, then it must be a substance of extraordinary potency. There seemed to be only one way of getting to the bottom of this. I decided on a self-experiment. 

&gt; Exercising extreme caution, I began the planned series of experiments with **the smallest quantity that could be expected to produce some effect, considering the activity of the ergot alkaloids known at the time: namely, 0.25 mg (mg = milligram = one thousandth of a gram) of lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate.**

Some points

* He claims to have meticulous work habits. I believe him, he was Swiss and a Chemist

* 250 micrograms is intense. The threshold is about 25 micrograms for microdosing, about 50 micrograms to know you're feeling something, 70-120 micrograms on a standard blotter. So he took a double dose.

Most people just gave name, or name and number, or put fake info entirely to claim their prize. One guy I know of filled out the whole form, accurately. He was in class with me when he realized (due to a discussion with the class about the concerns the school had when they heard about this) and he just looked like his life was over. Maybe it wasn't but it might be screwed up permanently. "

I think cats *chose* to be gay though depending on their circumstances. If they are not in an environment when survival is not a factor then they stop relying on instinct.


So, instinct tells a male cat to have sex with a female cat, but a neutered cat no longer has such urges. 


Instead of having a strong sense of urgency to have sex with the female, he will instead chose to surround himself with whatever other cat is around that he actually is *compatible* with...


Example.

I have 4 cats, one neutered male, non neutered male and two fixed females.

My neutered male prefers to be with the other male and displays more signs of affection with him. I think it's because their personalities are more similar than the other cats. 

Wow, I hope my rambling made sense.


TLDR; My male cat displays more affection to the other male cat.  "
"I'm Autistic and was non-verbal as a child. I was in mainstream education as I was a very intelligent kid, I just didn't speak. I was advanced in all my school work, to the point I was being given work from the years above (In the UK we don't move kids up a year). I speak now, but I do go through phases of not speaking. I'm in a successful long term relationship with a very intelligent neurotypical man, and whilst I don't have a ton of friends the few I do are very close friendships. You'd be surprised what us ""severely Autistic"" kids can end up achieving! I can't work, I go completely non-verbal and shut down in work-situations, but in other aspects of my life I'm doing pretty well :)"

You can probably guess I wasn't too happy."

"&gt;  I just didn't like the accusatory tone when they explained to us what happened

I know that feeling. I was in a second-hand shop one time and they had a bin of cheap, shitty MP3 players (like those random no-name ones that are sold super cheap in clam shell packaging). They were all the same price (like $7.50 or something). Turns out, though, there was actually a pretty nice looking Zune buried in there. I go to the register with the Zune, and the cashier refuses to sell it. She says an employee put it in there on accident (which is also weird, because they had literally no other MP3 players anywhere in the building -- all of them were $7.50, except apparently this Zune that nobody seemed to know how it got there, but it sure as hell didn't belong where I found it). The way she talked to me, you would've thought I had just personally stolen the Zune out of her crying child's hands and then walked up to the till with it. She eventually offered to sell it to me at a higher price than was advertised, which I'm pretty sure is actually illegal.

She only paid attention to us either when we won her praise or when our behaviour warranted intervention from higher-ups.

"No no, here's the thing: you can only treat one group of disenfranchised people with respect at a time.  If you have a movie with female empowerment, you must make fun of black people to a level just above the 1990's.  If you're making a film that is supposed to fight for racial justice, rest assured there will be hardly any female leads and those that are there will fill terrible tropes.  

The key is to lift one disenfranchised group up by disparaging another so audiences don't get too uppity about it."

DNA tests were possible at the time but it took much longer than it does now, so the baby was at least a year old when the dust settled. Baby turned out to be his.

While they both look very white, the Mom is brunette with curly hair and she was adopted as a baby. The assumption has always been that the baby was just a throw back. It took a couple years but they got back together and remarried. He always acts like he felt like an ass, but she's always been very understanding."

"Here is what I was told: It had to due with the costs of the swimsuit rendering further participation too expensive for some countries, and the disruption of the sport caused by the suits taking ~30 minutes to put on and take off. At that point it's like, *why not wear flippers? They're easier to put on and cheaper*. But both flippers and shark-suits and jet packs are all beyond the scope of the sport which is too see who is the best swimmer, not who has the best gear."

"I never felt satisfied by this explanation because it suggests that a pirate would give up their depth perception and then fight with their non-dominant eye either above or below deck (once they move the eyepatch to the other eye). Additionally, the pirate has a tactical disadvantage while they're moving the eyepatch, and realistically, did pirates even get into fights enough times like in a year for them to use this trick?"
"Basic computer and internet troubleshooting. Way too often I hear 'I'm computer illiterate' which just translates to 'I don't want to bother to learn so just do it for me'. \

Edit: Apparently it needs to be said that basic computer troubleshooting is not the same as learning code. Personally I don't know anything about code but I can set up an internet connection, manage my router, fix small issues like browsers crashing and most of the time get us back online if we lose internet connection. And if I can't get us back online I know the steps to figure out if it's my router or modem before I call my ISP and politely tell them that I am having an issue."
"On the contrary, the Muslims should be standing with the lgbt community.

Have you been to r/islam and their mega thread?

You don't need to respect us just as we don't need to support you.

Or,

I'll never advocate your type of lifestyle, but this guy didn't represent Islam.

Or,

The Koran says *acting* on homosexual impulses is a sin punishable by death. As long as you don't act on it [Abstinence? Celibacy?] and you keep it hidden/don't flaunt it, that's okay.

Then comes that next night and half the church is there, my grandparents even drove 14 hours to see me. So eventually I get back to the part I messed up on the day before and I just go *silent*.

I grew up looking nearly identical to my paternal grandmother, and absolutely nothing like anyone in my family. My dad is the image of his dad, my siblings all look like my mum etc. 

Until the last year or so when I seem to have settled on looking just like my dad, it was believed by an astonishing number of people we know that I was either adopted or the result of an affair. We used to joke the milkman had the same name as my dad so if my mum said 'Her dad is Bob' then she wasn't technically lying. 

But we've genuinely been meeting people, old family, friends etc and when my tall, leggy blonde mum would introduce little pale dark haired victorian orphan looking me, we'd be asked, in my presence, 'what country did you adopt her from?!'

Most people thought I was a Russian orphan. "

I guess I've got a very very light social anxiety since I've got a few of those but very mild. I guess the only time it gets bad is when I'm in a formal situation or if everyone else is dressed at a level of formal that's slightly different from my own and I feel like everyone is noticing that I'm not dressed correctly. Also at Catholic churches because that's got formalness and I never went to any church growing up so I don't know *any* of the stuff.

"Whenever I have a shower-corner spider we come into an accord that he/she is cool to chill in the shower corner, but if I find him elsewhere its a violation of the ceasefire and all bets are off. But when I first moved into my current apartment i didn't have much stuff and had been searching for a pet for some time. I found a roaming jumping spider wandering around and was like ""bruh you can't be here"" and he immediately attacked an ant i didn't see. Having proven his worth, I decided he could stay even though he wasn't a stationary shower corner spider. I named him Frank, and saw him around my living room/kitchen all the time. He was the man, and the amount of bugs in my apt drastically diminished. As the weeks went on  Frank grew bigger and bigger and our friendship flourished; I would share pepperonis off my pizzas and we would watch romantic comedies together. 
One day down the road a stint I had my buddy over before we were going to the beach.

I had to run back to the toilets to calm down. Later I gave the poor kid a balloon because I felt guilty. Luckily he didn't get hurt that bad, the glass didn't break and neither did any part of his body.  "

I think it fits more into domestic terrorism than an ISIS issue - it doesn't seem like ISIS knew about this or helped him with it beforehand, they just took advantage of his call to 911 pledging his allegiance and piggybacked. He could have targeted any populated area of ""sinful"" Americans - but he chose a popular gay nightclub. I also think this is one of the situations where this would have happened whether or not his firearms were legal. To me, the hate crime issue is the most obvious and most depressing.

Jackson kills it as a charismatic villain, DeNiro turns in a subtle and realistic performance as a washed up bank robber, and Pam Grier, Robert Forster,  Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, and Chris Tucker, are all great. The dialogue is great and the plot is incredibly smart and needs a few viewings to fully understand. Tarantino's most under-stated and least flashy movie. Definitely one of the best films of the 1990s."

"Let me tell you this-- /r/Drama is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans ""n[slur]""), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that /r/drama may be producing an entire army of Dylann Roofs and Elliot Rogers, and I highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura."

"Have you thought about starting a community owned ISP? Is that legal in Australia? Here in the US, a few of the fastest/best service is through the city owned fiber. Of course on the other hand, I'm in Florida and they have passed laws to make it illegal.

edit: ok not illegal just punished with excessive requirements. Much like what the Republicans attempted to do to the US Postal Service.

"The whole process is fucked and 100% keeps the cash flowing into the court systems. 

Late night drinking, everyone ditches and goes off leaving a person stranded.

Okay, sleep in the car. Wake up in the morning, drive home. NBD.
An hour later an officer opens your car door, drags you out of thr vehicle. Half asleep, obviously still slightly intoxicated gives you a roadside sobriety test. Obviously you fail. Your car gets impounded, your brought to the town court and have to either stay in jail or call a friend at 430 am to come pick you up.

Next day. Sobered up, freaking out you find out how to get your car. 380$ cash you get your car after calling multiple offices just to figure out who has it and where it is.

Next step. Lawyer up. Great. 1200$ later, you get an ""okay"" deal for a DUAI for sleeping in the back of your car and not even driving fucking drunk.

You receive a conditional license. 100$, you have to take a phsych eval. 150$. You have to take  a 10 class dont drink and drive course 250$. And you have to attend AA if you fail the physch eval showed any signs off addiction.

Woo hells almost over. Jk.

First time offender needs a minimum of 6 months with a breathalyzer system installed in your car. Just 300$ for install. Fuck. Okay, i guess. Oh and its 150$ a month to ""maintain"" the device. One more punch to the balls. 180$ removal fee. Also fun fact. If you dont foot the bill on time every month your car becomes disabled and you need to have it towed to the service place.

55$ svc charge to now have a regular license back. Fuck yeah.

Whats the tab there 3400$ ish and 8-9 months of bullshit. For sleeping in your fucking vehicle. 

The system is fucked. 


Edit: ahhhh i forgot court fees, tickets and surcharges. My bad. It was only like 595$ for those."

"Jörmungandr ""also known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, is a sea serpent, the middle child of the giantess Angrboða and Loki. According to the Prose Edda, Odin took Loki's three children by Angrboða—the wolf Fenrir, Hel, and Jörmungandr—and tossed Jörmungandr into the great ocean that encircles Midgard. The serpent grew so large that it was able to surround the earth and grasp its own tail. As a result, it received the name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. When it lets go, the world will end. Jörmungandr's arch-enemy is the god Thor."""

"The cameras were not built by NASA. They were Mitchell BNC rear projected, priceless, cameras. He acquired them from Warner Bros. Practically destroying these pieces of cinema history, he force-fitted some super low f-stop Zeiss lenses, which were made *for* NASA to shoot on the moon.

This super fast lens allowed him to capture amazing shots by natural and candlelight, thus making his own cinema history. Totally worth it.

The thing I love about that story is that he was using superlative, cutting-edge quality technical equipment to achieve an extremely true-to-the-time piece of cinema. If anyone hasn't seen Barry Lyndon, it comes highly recommended, especially if you are interested in cinematography."

"That kid definitely sounds weird and in need of help.

Regarding the number of PreK and Kindergarten expulsions/suspensions you're school is having its probably the school and not the students.

I've a son that was expelled from 3 pre-schools. Not for violence just for being active and independent.  These were ""high"" performing schools. Schools with beautiful facilities and lofty mission statements.

When observing these classrooms it turned out they were just factories. The teachers were stressed to do all these activities that the kids could show back to parents.  He'd frequently bring back colorings that didn't match his style of coloring. The result was little teacher engagement and the content production of the classroom only worked with passive children.  I watched as the teacher completed one kids artwork (explaining the coloring style).  And my son, whom she said couldn't stay on one task, I watched him be very focused on his painting only to have it taken away after 30 seconds so they could continue the assembly line. 

We ended up placing my son in a school that didn't have those expectations on kids younger than 5 year  producing content and he hasn't been suspended or expelled since.

I'll add expulsion of boys at the K and pre-k level has become by far the most common expulsion primarily due to these types of schools."

"&gt;In India, I suspect (but cannot confirm) that it's purely driven by women being second class citizens with no rights. Men can work fields etc, and are ""worth more"" to the family as a whole. Men can potentially get a better job and bring in more income for the family.

There are different kinds of India in India. In the districts and states with a very bad sex ratio, the main reason for not having girls, is that the marriage of the girl is of paramount importance to the family as she gets older and it takes a lot of wealth to marry off a girl. 

The fact that boys can earn more and add to the income is not quite right though, families prefer a boy because of the reason that when the boy grows up and its time for him to marry, the family can now claim a huge dowry. 

Fucked up and regressive, to say the least, but unfortunately, education hasn't resolved this particular issue. In the cities though, you won't find the open revulsion towards girl childs, but a lot of families subtly have a veiled dislike towards having a girl child in the family. 

Over the years, a lot of reforms have been enacted to stem the growth of this monstrous problem like banning sex determination of fetuses, giving more incentive to people for educating their daughters, giving an economic incentive to people, with higher interest rates in certain kinds of Fixed Deposits in the name of daughters, reservations for women in various local government bodies etc.

There have been small victories, recently 4 women were inducted into the Indian Air Force as fighter pilots, a lot of women hold the positions of top Banks in the country, we have sportswomen like Sania Mirza and Saina Nehwal who are an inspiration to all and other such things. 

But the problem is far from over, and all this from the land where we congregate each year in festivals of Goddesses like Saraswati and Durga, it is heartbreaking. "

Anyway, the ball is rolled to her and she kicks away, she's running to first and there's my boy, running next to her, rooting her on to base without a fuk given about what the other kids were doing. I knew then that wifey and I had done something right.  Was proud of him that day, am proud of him today.  It was a good day. "

It's been tough because we basically categorize submissions into 2 categories - Chance and Skill. Initially, everything was chance, for example 2 planes collide in midair 10,000 feet up and everyone survives. Then came the skill posts like the worlds record longest basketball shot. While the skill stuff was super popular, a lot of the community cried foul - ""This isn't odds defying""

And they were right. Since then it's been tough to find a proper balance. We tried flairs, limiting skill posts to just Monday and Fridays, posting several sticky posts to discuss it and we still don't have a 'solution' per say - both are allowed."

All havoc broke loose when everyone went for the guns and darts were shot everywhere. I, being a small quiet girl, wrecked havoc on my foes, surprising them with my sudden serious attitude and quick moves. 
I ended up being the champion and ever since then, if there was a nerf war going to break out, people were quick to form an alliance with me. 

Edit: just some pre-nerf war pics i took.

"I grew up in some apartments as a kid. And I made a lot of friends there immediately. But because I moved there late I wasn't able to go to the same school as said friends. There was this one kid in particular named 'Edward' he was so cool and extremely popular. But what I didn't realize is that he treated me like shit. 

So after about a year of being friends with these kids but going to a different school. I finally got into the same school. I was really happy because I could finally hangout with my ""best friend"" Edward. We weren't in the same class so I would hangout with him and his friends during recess. This is 5th grade by the way.

But after a week of school I naturally started making new friends and one recess I was hanging out with someone else. Again I say Edward was the most popular kid in school so people would do anything for him. 

I'm having a good time with my new friend during recess and then some kid comes up and says ""Edwards gonna kick your ass after school."" I just look and don't say anything. 

After school comes and Edward and his posse fucking throw rocks at me the whole way home. 

But I was a fucking idiot and took those friends back constantly until I met real friends in middle school that I still talk to today. So i guess thats one of the many times ive been backstabbed by a friend. If I contact Edward today we'd be cool but fuck he tormented my life and if I could beat him down since I finally grew up and got bigger I would.  

But it's in the past now I suppose.

"When I taught preschool years ago, there was one little girl who I thought needed to be on medication.  She was terrible.  One day, she was at the top of the slide, and there was another little girl sitting down to go down the slide.  I caught that little shit's eye and watched her pull her knee up.  I knew she was going to kick her and as we have eyes locked, I start to say ""Do not kick her"", she did a ""this is Sparta"" kick and shoved the little girl off the top of the slide.  I was livid and she just stood there and laughed as the other girl was in hysterics from being thrown through the air. 
 
The little girl who was kicked was the owners niece and that nasty little girl was expelled 30 min. later.  
I have seen her around town over the years.  She's been expelled from 2 public schools and both of the private schools in town.  She truly is a psychopath and I've known hundreds of kids.  She's the only one I ever thought could actually kill someone at 5 years old.  "

"When I was younger, there used to be a shed in my backyard that held old yard tools and what have you. We had this shed for a while, but it was rarely used, which led to us not even opening the door for very long periods of time. 

Anyways, one day I was just chilling outside by myself when I felt like searching for some old scooters me and my brother had. I figured the best place to start looking was inside the shed, so I made my way over to it and took the lock off. 

Before I opened the doors though, I just suddenly got this feeling of ""nope"" in my stomach and stood outside the shed wondering why I felt like I did. 

I knew that something was wrong and the reason had something to do with what was inside the shed that I didn't know about. 

I put the lock back on and ran inside to get my dad.

After he came outside, I told him about the whole situation and he decided to take a took for himself. When he cracked the shed doors open, there was a **huge** wasp nest just on the inside of the wall of the shed, and they were pissed off. 

My dad slammed the shed doors closed again and blocked up any entryways he saw until he called an exterminator to take care of the problem. 

I would have been seriously stung by a hundred wasps, probably. There was definitely  a shit-ton of wasps. 

I'm forever glad I didn't open up the shed without telling someone first. "
"You..you're on to something there. That's how I've been for a long time but I'm trying my hardest to get out of this mentality.

I feel incredibly threatened by other women, especially strong independent ones. I'm a very jealous person by nature. But us women need to build eachother up instead of what I do in my mind which is pick women apart because I don't have and never will have certain traits that they may have because they are a different human. I'm really trying to overcome it but yes..it's all about becoming comfortable in my skin. Which I'm having a really hard time doing..but I'm faking it as best as I can.."

"When I was 17 I started showing signs of serious depression. I brought it up several times over the course of the next few years, practically begging to see a therapist, but each time I was basically told to suck it up and knuckle down and I'd be fine. What's worse, my father would often question me about the ""rut"" I was in and wondered why I was so unmotivated. I'm almost 30, still depressed as hell, still vocal about it, and he's still baffled as to why I don't have a career, a family, or aspirations. At this point my entire family thinks I'm just a whiny, needy, lazy piece of shit.

EDIT: ITT People assuming depression = being whiny, doing nothing, and letting others take care of you. I work my ass off and make my own fucking money. I do my God damndest to live a full life. I can't fucking afford to see a shrink, go fuck yourself for assuming I can but don't. Even if I could I have 1000s in dental work that needs to be done first. I rarely even talk to my family, and at this point I don't even live in the same state as them. I certainly don't ask them for anything. 99% people don't know how shitty I feel all the time, or how difficult it is for me to enjoy things, because I keep this shit to myself. If you honestly have nothing better to do than shit talk depressed people on the internet then you could probably use therapy too.

This exact bullshit is why people choose to suffer in silence until they can't stand it anymore and end up doing something drastic."

Basically, this CEO would send a car to pick up the prospective candidate in, and have the driver ask them questions about their day, etc. Small talk. Once thedriver dropped off the candidate at the office, the CEO would make it a point to ask the driver what he thought about the candidate. Anyone who was clearly a dick, or came across with an air of superiority was dismissed early on during the interview process.

I work a sucky corporate job that has made me stop caring about others and also resulted in me working late hours - so bye bye friends, relationships, social life and interests. All of this was just to get a good job and make sure I was on a decent wage, so I could do and provide more to my relationship, friends and interests.

"&gt; Self defense should not immediately equal being able to kill another human being.

Actually, that may be the difference there- Whether you think a reasonable response to someone who threatens you is to kill him or not. I'm guessing you go with no, but the US leans toward yes. 



This may or may not involve the US taking threats to safety or harm as a much, much more serious thing- possibly the same motive as zero-tolerance policies in schools, high and frequent lawsuits for injury, etc, etc. "

"Went to school with a guy who was in the top 3 meanest bullies in my middle school and high school. he was a tiny guy but he hung out with the popular kids and made sure to make everyones life miserable.

One weekend morning im at a friends house. we're having breakfast and police start putting that crime scene tape all over the back alley. neither of us knew what happened and didnt really care. our town had a population of around 5000 people. not alot crazy happens. we go on about our day.

monday i head into summer school and half of the class is crying. the teacher isnt there. i dont ask anyone why theyre crying, i just start drawing and ignoring everyone as usual. teacher finally shows up after about 30 minutes. 

""everyone can go home. no class today."" 

i was so happy! someone that was as clueless as me finally asks whats up. teacher explains a student was murdered over the weekend. 

i would later find out that the bully from my school was at a party. he did some meth and freaked out and ended up stabbing a girl to death. 

i think thats the only murderer i knowly know. he was probably the biggest prick a knew at the time and if someone was going to jail i couldnt be happier it was him."

Use a 9-inch, 2 3/4-inch high springform pan, line with baking paper.


**Crust**
1 cup (100 g) of Graham cracker crumbs (from about 15 Graham crackers)
1 cup (100 g) of oreo crumbs (leave the filling in)
2 Tbsp sugar
Pinch salt
4 Tbsp plus 1 teaspoon (60g) unsalted butter melted

in the foodprocessor, then press them in the form


**Cheese - banana filling**
2 pounds cream cheese (900 g), room temperature
1 1/3 cup granulated sugar (270 g)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 large eggs
1/2 cup sour cream (160 ml)
3 very ripe bananas


Mix all together, add on top of the crust

Place an ovenproof bowl with water next to the cheesecake in the oven to prevent the top from cracking.
Bake at 180 °C for 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 100 °C for another 30 minutes or until the center isn't wobbly anymore.


Let it cool IN the pan. 


**toppings**

Keep the cake in the pan.
3 just-ripe bananas (not as ripe as the one for the filling) sliced. Arrange them on top of the cake.
Make a chocolate ganache [like this one:] (http://www.averiecooks.com/2012/08/chocolate-cake-with-chocolate-ganache.html) and add it on top of the bananas right way so the bananas don't brown.

"Buckingham Palace.

I used to cycle passed Buckingham Palace once weekly to work. Every day there were tourists outside milling about with little to do. Unless you're getting a tour of the state rooms, there's nothing to do there.

Let's examine your motives for visiting.

* To see the royal family.

A trip from Buckingham Palace to Windsor castle is 1h20 door-to-door. Windsor Castle looks like a *proper castle* and, if you're a tourist, you get to see some actual English countryside. The English countryside is pretty shite, but apparently it's something people like.

* To see a big Palace.

Buckingham Palace is more of a stately home than a Palace. It's not very architecturally interesting. Going to the Palace of Westminster, where the British Parliament (House of Commons and House of Lords) sits is much better.

* Because you're in the area and it's a thing to see.

Next to Buckingham Palace are two parks, St. James Park, and Green Park. Both are great. Spending time in a London park is hugely underrated.

* It's London! You've got to see it!

There are much better bits of London, a little, but not much, off the beaten track. I recommend Camden Market, the Greenwich Maritime district, or Kensington, if you want some experiences."

"I taught at a pretty rough school for a while, I had 2 pairs of students I was convinced would be arrested and they were only middle schoolers. The worst thing was that one pair was in 7th and one pair was in 8th grade and I was convinced that they were working together in some sort of middle school mob.

Kids 1&amp;2 (7th Graders 12~13 years old): 1 would walk in class and would NEVER do what was asked of him, wouldn't even sit in a seat. He would bring gameboys and other things that I would take from him since they were banned in school. Each time I would ask him to do something or take something away that he wasn't allowed to have he would have a meltdown. I mean a fucking MELTDOWN. Crying, screaming, like a two year old. Kid 2 was some sort of conniving genius, he would purposefully act dumb so he wouldn't have to do any work. He was 'diagnosed' with a bunch of things like ADHD, social disorders and other problems. He received an IEP because of it (Individualized Education Program. Basically its a legal document schools use to ensure students with issues are getting the correct help and accommodations so that they can do their work). His IEP it listed he needed 5 min breaks every 5 minutes and that he could bring toy because the toys ""calmed him down""... really?  I personally didn't buy it, especially because he was ""diagnosed"" to have social problems with his classmates and had a ""hard time making friends"", but when the students had a free period or during lunch, Kid 2 had no problems talking to students and being an ass overall. But the real reason Kid 1&amp;2 were villains in the making was that Kid1&amp;2 were friends and they left a notebook my classroom one day. I read through it because they were always writing in it during class. The notebook accounted a bunch of nasty information about their classmates and teachers, including me. It was kinda like a burn book. It had speculations about a student with an eating disorder, a classmate's suicidal father, the principal and her failing marriage. I turned it in and most of the things in the book were true, the school counselor confirmed it.

Kids3&amp;4 (8th graders 14~15 years old): Kid 3 had an IEP that listed he had ""Defiance Disorder"", or as I like to call it 'he was a soicopath'. Basically if you were a teacher, parent, coach or anyone in authority he wouldn't do anything you asked him to do. Cursed me out on multiple occasions and had to be removed many times. After many incidents there would be a conference with me (the teacher) Kid 3, his parent, the principal and the dean. Each time at the end of the meeting he would give this really creepy apology about how he would never do anything bad again. It was totally insincere and it reminded me of the scene in Harry Potter2 and 6 when Tom riddle talks to dumbledore in 2 and slughorn in 6. Like he was in control of the situation, rather than the adults in the room, or like he was Professor X and able to mind control us. Creepy. Kid 3 was friends with Kid 4 who was more like the Hulk and would just go APESHIT when he was disciplined. He broke his hand twice, both times when he was given a detention, he punched a window (broke it) and punched a locker (broke that too). He was an 8th grader and was dating a Senior at the school, he would come to school in sleeveless shirts that would show scratches and hickeeys on his back, chest and neck. He would make any comment or instruction and make it sexual. He sexually harassed the young Art teacher and was removed from her classes. 

With all of these cases it wasnt any help that the Principal was an idiot and though all the kids were little Angels and would never discipline them. Needless to say, I dont work there anymore. lol"

"Yeah, kind of what I realized after a while is that so many abortions happen because of situations where people feel like they don't have any options.

His mother took advantage of him in a vulnerable position (lost the use of his arms) to begin molesting him at a young age, and manipulated his father somehow into agreeing with it. You cannot tell me that doesn't have *some* effect on somebody."

So my family was in his familys pub in a small Offaly town and since he was the minister for children and my father was a bit drunk he thought it would be a funny if I got a picture being held by Brian Cowen. He was reluctant and before the picture was taken I slipped out of his hands and if it wasnt for him bearly grabbing my arm I would've completely smashed into the ground dislocated my elbow or shoulder though..

The recommendation of law enforcement basically everywhere and probably the corporate policy of the gas station would in fact be *not* to go after someone stealing beer.

I worked retail in a state with super strict alcohol laws and still has dry counties, but there's still no requirements other than actually asking for ID and checking the photos and dates. The enforcement officers aren't even allowed to bullshit people with fake IDs or slight-of-hand or anything (except in actual bars, who have stricter requirements in lots of states). You just ask for the ID, look at what they hand you, and refuse to sell if the dates or photos don't work. Anything else that happens is not your fault and not your problem."

"yes, but the reverse is true when you leave the spot. it's easier to drive straight out than to back out. some people also just generally prefer to get the more difficult stuff out of the way first, then have an easier time later.

more importantly, it's safer: entering the spot is inherently less dangerous than exiting it; driving backwards is inherently more dangerous than driving forward. if you front in and back out, you're doing both of the more dangerous things at the same time. but if you back in and front out, you're doing one safer and one more dangerous thing each time, making the most dangerous part less dangerous. TL;DR: it's significantly safer to pull out of a spot than to back out of it, and not significantly more dangerous to back into a spot than to pull out of it.

"I'll avoid any specifics for obvious confidentiality reasons, but here's a few summaries of some of the crazier ones.

-Guy tried to use the idea of him spending time with the kids as a bargaining chip as something he would give up. He gives up time with his kids; she gives up something else (financially).

-Guy stormed out of the courthouse literally minutes from having the case finished and finalized because he didn't like the auto shop where the soon-to-be-ex-wife was going to take the son's car for an oil change.

-A Lady who demanded that I petition the court to use Mongolian divorce law after I explained to her that the law of my state would not give her essentially everything from the marriage. Apparently Mongolian law is pretty generous to the woman. Who knew?

-Mother who decided she was going to move to the other side of the country and the boyfriend dumped her for cheating on him. She demanded half of his things and accounts (even though they weren't married and had only lived together for just over a year and had no claim to any of it). When he refused, she threatened to take the child out of state to her parents, and when he filed to get custody, she came to me and told me I had approximately 2 months to get her court permission to permanently leave the state. (A removal case like that routinely takes 6-18 months, depending on complexity, for everyone's reference.) After two months when I had, lo and behold, not gotten the court's approval, she fired me. I checked on the case file almost two years after getting fired, and she was on attorney #4. Guess the others were as ""utterly worthless"" as I was, to use her words.

-Grandmother who started phoning social services to conduct repeated investigations about abuse after finding out that state law did not grant her automatic rights to the grandchildren the same as a parent has. She figured that if she could somehow convince the court that both parents were unfit, even if it was just through repeated complaints or tip-offs, the Judge would grant the children to her and her alone. (I left the practice in the midst of this case, so I don't know how it turned out and what became of the grandmother, because no judge is going to put up with that shit.)"

The gang wanted me to commit to a game. 



I got invited to hang out with my female friends. 



I didn't want to play that day, but I promised, so I did. 



My defiance was passively on display by my two elven characters Santa, and Goofy. 



Goofy usually did the dumbest thing that a character could do.  



Santa was making a list every chance I got.   When I was ordered to do something else, as everyone was tired of me always making a list, I decided to check it.   When they couldn't stand me checking it, I insisted that I must check it thoroughly, and do so, twice. 



Meanwhile, the DM had a great game prepared that he had saved for us.   The first key moment was to go into a cave.   Goofy was the first in.   



The extremely large sleeping spider was no match for goofy's insistence to sing and dance and just make as much noise as possible. 



At request of the group, I had to roll against luck, and intelligence several times, for the hope that goofy might get serious in a life or death situation. I always failed. 



Those two characters were quite difficult to level up. "

Eventually I lost it and screamed at her to stop. Apparently the teacher hadn't noticed and just heard me scream ""STOP!"" or whatever it was that I actually said.

The entire room stopped, and everyone was staring at me. The teacher said something to the effect of ""If you can't act like a first grader, then you're going back to kindergarten.""

She got a kindergarten teacher and forced me to sit in her class for the rest of the day.

Oh also the kindergarten teacher took it upon herself to announce to her entire class ""This is TacticalTruth, he's here because [bs reasons] blah blah blah blah"".

And the more prodding I get to talk the longer it takes, and the more likely I am to get snappy like you said because I just want to be left alone to sort things out in my mind and simmer down, and if you can't seem to get that in the moment, it's irritating and only adding fuel to the fire.

"Love, Actually started the trend of ""ensemble films"" as they're called. It was a genuinely good movie that just happened to have parts that were all suited for particularly famous actors and it worked out brilliantly. Then studios saw that and went ""Well we'll just throw a bunch of a-listers together too!"" without realizing that the movie was well-written before it had an all-star cast.

Technically it doesn't fall into this category because it was the first of it's kind and spawned a genre of poor imitations that don't actually follow the proper formula. They're more like genetically deficient clones than fellow members of a genre. Love, Actually stands alone."

"I grew up way before gay rights was remotely mainstream, when people still lost their jobs and had their lives ruined if they got outed.  As a kid I thought being gay was bad just because that's how everyone presented the idea to me, and I hadn't been exposed to the other (and right) side of that argument.  Most people back then probably weren't disgusting people for being anti gay, they were just ignorant.  The fact that there's nothing wrong with being gay just wasn't something that got said a lot back then.  Much as we'd like to think otherwise, to a large extent the beliefs we hold and the assumptions we make are just things the other people around us think.  Not many people are natural born skeptics who go out of their way to question everything they hear; most people just a accept what people around them say.  Now, in 2016 if you're still anti gay, then you're a stupid pig, but back then most people just didn't know any better."

The fact that you hate/don't forgive someone doesn't mean you are living your life plotting revenge and thinking of them all the time. In fact it's very possible you don't think of them at all, but if for any reason you get reminded you will acknowledge the person sucks and you don't give a shit about their well being and don't forgive anything, and then again move on to more interesting topics. Personal honesty is good and allowing yourself your hatred can feel good too."

The asian-american approach which i learned from my parents - 'work hard, have a successful career, and women will just flock towards you' - is not accurate.  Money doesn't help you at all in attracting women, at least not until you get to yacht-level amounts of money (e.g.: tens of millions).  I'm not angry at my parents for raising me that way, I just regret not figuring out the truth until I hit my 30's."

A lot of Philly sports fans are assholes, no question. The problem I have isn't that reality, it's that fans from every city are often just as bad.

Violence at a Philly game reinforces an opinion, violence at other stadiums are viewed as anomalies even if they're worse.

"ex-gf, 25 years ago.  (I got in way over my head on this one, I was only 22).  She had some drug problems.  :(  Heroin.  She had been a teenage runaway. I had a phone conversation with her parents, and they asked me to help her come home.  I would drop her off, and say goodbye. (turns out . . . forever).  We drove for 24 hours STRAIGHT through.  

When I got her home, we slept, and the next day, when I woke up on her parents couch, in their family room, they had a huge entertainment center, and a whole wall covered in shelves of VHS tapes.  It was mostly porn. Hard core.  It occurred to me that I had made a horrible mistake.  I had slept on the same couch where her mom and dad sat, and watched their porn together.

Mind-you: This was 1991. There was no such thing as internet porn.  Porn was really NOT a mainstream, acceptable thing. 

I really wasn't together enough, at that time, myself, to take-on the responsibility of ""saving"" her.  Especially after that.  No.  I took it upon myself to get myself the fuck out of there.

A week later, we talked on the phone, and she had already hooked up with her ex.  Yeah.  Never heard from her again. :("

It's actually a pretty interesting concept for a game, I personally think it's well executed, given it's repetative nature.

The kid in the family that I went to school with dressed like he was a columbine shooter. I cant think of another way to describe him then that. Tall boots, camo pants, leather duster, hair down to the middle of his back. He also smelled really bad. I didnt ever interact with him but from what I saw he seemed to enjoy being a kind of outcast and would do weird shit just to prove it. Example: one time I was on the bus leaving campus and I saw the kid smashing a bicycle by the side of the road. There may have been 30 people on my bus and we were one of at least 8 in a line leaving the campus. The kid didnt give a fuck about anything from what I saw. 

A saying in my town is that you can tell who belongs to this family by the way they smell. this is why their house on main st was bought out by the city.

They are kind of the weird reality show spectacle of the city but the family has serious issues as well as  large criminal record ranging from petty theft to pedophilia"

"Oktoberfest was literally one of the best experiences in my life and I'm literally teaching myself German right now, partly because I want to go back. I know a lot of people speak English at the festival, but I want to be more engaged. Also, Weisn is only *one* reason I want to go back to Germany, so I'm not learning for a reason as superficial as ""I want to ask for beer in German!""

You live in Munich, so you're probably just desensitized to it, but as an American who had seen nothing like it, Oktoberfest was amazing. On the flipside, you've probably seen videos about Spring Break in the US, and think it's awesome. I don't care about beach binging anymore. 

Also, I want to visit Munich outside of Oktoberfest, as well. When I went, we were on a limited schedule. We hit 4 cities (Berlin, Prague, Munich, Stuttgart) and we went to Munich *for* Oktoberfest. If we had more time, I would have loved to see more of Munich and Bavaria in general (although I got to see the BMW museum, which was pretty sweet), but we were on a mission lol.

Oh, and lastly. I don't think the beer was overpriced. About 10 euro for a Maß? Go to a bar in the US, and beer usually costs $4-5 for a Bud Light (I paid $8 for one at an ""upscale"" club in Chicago). 3 of those are $12-15. One Maß has just as much beer, with higher ABV, for less money. I wouldn't call that overpriced. "

I miss the freedom of choice I had as a civilian, I hate these endless wars and constantly worrying about what will happen next with them, where I'll go, etc. I got so weary of being out in the field. I'm tired of leaving friends behind.

On the other, I know that I'll miss the camaraderie, the brotherhood. You make friends and you go through all hell together, and those bonds are stronger and deeper than any I've known. Even though I'm an introvert by nature and my solitude is valuable to me, the impact of these friendships is unmistakable and irreplaceable.

Also I'm terrified that there's nothing out there for me, job-wise. I worry that my experiences and what I've learned has no place in the civilian world."

"America's entire history has been profiting on World Wars. America was able to defeat Britain due to France coming to its aid in a global conflict and during the Napoleonic wars America proclaimed neutrality and sold to both sides. However, America was flexing its industrial muscle before the First World War with guys like J.P Morgan and John D. Rockefeller and those sorts of monopolies during a period Mark Twain calls ""the gilded age"". America was actually making so much profit that going off of the gold standard was a major issue for presidential candidates and political discourse! Fun fact, that's actually what the Wizard of Oz is about, the gold standard! In addition, America had opened up trade to Asia and had taken the Spanish Colonies from them about 14 years before the start of WW1. It's actually my favorite time period in U.S. history as a huge journalism fan, basically the people who defined American journalism were born in this time period.

"Hooo boy. I'm crazy because when he broke up with me, he told me ""I like her now too, but I can keep dating you if you want"" and I just couldn't handle that.

That started a whirlwind of me crying and leaving rooms if I saw them together, freaking out on other people, on him, etc, and he was in general ""fuck this bitch"" behind my back and to my face about it all. Essentially, we tried to maintain a friendship but I was overly sensitive, and he was his typical self + slightly more cruel so as to create more distance between us.

I grew up in a strict household and clung to every single relationship that I could possibly maintain (as much as you can maintain a friendship when you can only hang out w/ them outside of school once a month MAYBE)...so when we broke up it hurt me far deeper than I expected, as he was one of the few people that actually knew me. To lose that felt like a rejection of all of me, as a person. My family didn't know me, only my friends did. So to lose a friend felt like I was losing a part of myself (I still feel invisible if I'm alone, haha)

I really was a crying, annoying, desperate bitch though. But he was also a callous bastard about it too. Sigh.

There isn't as large a problem with gun ownership in rural areas as cities, but rural people see laws to increase gun regulation as impacting them, when they are really meant to control guns in cities. I would argue that it would be most impactful to enforce stricter gun regulations in cities, where the majority of gun-related crime and mass shootings occur. I, being from a rural area, understand the want to own guns, but I also understand the need for regulation to try and limit the number of deaths due to shootings. The problem with guns isn't for rural America, its for urban America. "

"Save at least 10% of your net income.  15% to 20% is better if you can stand it, but at least 10%.

Never leave a job until you have another job.  Don't do it.  Stuff happens.

Manage and invest your savings.  When you get several thousand stacked, move it from savings to a more profitable investment.  A no load fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, etc. will generally do well over long periods of time.  Once you have about $10k stacked you can pull 10% off to a riskier investment vehicle that has a better return than the market average.

I think that cultivated meat is going to absolutely take off in the next couple of decades.

Why buy crappy beef when there's wagyu beef available in every store?

"A smart business could have discontinued the stamp program but still honored the cards that were out there.  I for a while had a loyalty punch card system at my store and when I stopped running that program, it meant that I stopped handing out any new punch cards.  I'd finish punching the ones that you already had going if you had one already in-progress to being full.  And I'd accept any cards that you still had that were full.  But once those were gone, they were gone. Most of the cards were redeemed in the first few months after I stopped issuing them. After that they'd pop up occasionally, someone with an old one in their wallet, someone who had moved across town, etc.  I honored a full one a few months ago even though I stopped doing the promotion like 3 or 4 years ago. But it worked well to discontinue the program that way without anyone feeling cheated.  Nobody lost anything they felt like they'd earned or been promised. 

That coffee shop would have been money way ahead to have just done it like that.  The thief would have run out of cards of his own somewhat soon (assuming he didn't steal a big stack of those,too) and after that he couldn't get anything free off of it anymore.  But the rest of the people who'd been saving up their stamped cards wouldn't get cheated out of their freebies.

"A longer sentence would have a major impact on **anyones** life, so that's a bit of a dumb argument. Whats the difference between this kid and another? His success at swimming? His Stanford education? 

What about all the other criminals who do get long sentences for selling weed (best example I could think of) that get locked away for years? They didn't even really harm anyone else, yet we don't give a damn about their well being. 

Sorry for the rant, but this kid caused unknown amounts of trauma to this girl. And we all know prison isn't about rehabilitation as much as its about punishment and public safety. Except in this kids case. But why? Why does he get preferential treatment?"

At no point trough this process do I tell other people what to do. 

At no point did I say people shouldn't make offensive jokes, I actually said it's completely human to do so. 

I was saying why _I_ don't like rape jokes and I was calling for more empathy, I sincerely don't believe these two things to be mutually exclusive. 

""A normal person"" should make whatever jokes she might like, I don't have to find them funny and if my PTSD inconveniences them I find it a teensy bit hard to care.

"Misleading people into thinking a smoothie itself is going to lead to weight loss is not only malicious but simply untrue. Weight loss is simply CICO - calories in, calories out. The calories matter. I could eat 3000 calories worth of healthy food every day and gain weight, or I could eat 1200 calories of Mcdonalds every day to lose weight. My point is that the choice of food has no effect on weight loss - calories is the only thing that matters for that. The only con is that you will be unhealthy if you choose to eat a poor diet, and you will feel awful. 

The shakes probably do nothing but make her healthy and feel good. If she ate 3000+ calories worth of those shakes she'd only be gaining weight.

If people knew weight loss was as simple as CICO, and there isn't some ""secret"" or ""trick"" to weight-loss, we'd have a lot more healthy BMI people on this Earth. Maybe that should be taught in schools - especially considering obesity epidemics. "

"A girl from my class in 9th grade got thrown out from home all the time. For some reason that was her moms go-to solution if her daughter had done something she didn't approve of.

The daughter, let's call her Betty, was a little special, and her mom was too. Betty had actually come to my door and asked for a place to crash a few times. I always had the idea that it was probably just an argument gone wrong and they had both said some stuff and needed to cool off. Not that she would actually **throw out** her only child, right?

*Wrong*. I went to her apartment one day and we had eaten cake and all was fine and fucking dandy. Well, until Betty for some reason asks me if I wanted to borrow a book about drawing instructions. (I can't draw at all and she knew it.) I said yes and started drawing and she's just checking her phone or some shit. As if to get me occupied or something.

Half an hour later, her mom enters the room and starts scolding Betty for not doing the laundry. Betty said there was not enough dirty clothes for an entire load. Betty's mom asked her to pack up her shit and leave after I had been picked up.

I couldn't believe my ears. Betty reacted as if she had been asked to just go pick up milk at the grocery store. No tears, no anger, no nothing. She just started packing an overnight bag and told me it was probably best for me to call my mom now instead of waiting the remaining three hours. I called her and my mom thought something had happened to me (that I was hurt) but I tried to gently tell her just to pick me the fuck up.

I asked Betty if she wanted to stay at my place.

Her: ""Oh no need, I'll stay at my boyfriend's place.""

Me: ""Okay. Where does he live?""

Her: ""He doesn't really have an address.""

Me: ""What?""

Her: ""He lives on a field outside the city. He'll pick me up on his scooter.""

Me: ""He lives... on a field?""

Her: ""Yeah. In a caravan.""

Me: ""How did he get a caravan?""

Her: ""I dunno, I guess he stole it.""

Me: ""... alright....????""

Her: ""Yeah so see ya.""

And the mom just said goodbye as if she hadn't just screamed at her daughter in front of me and thrown her out..."

I still have scars from pushing her off me and her literally grabbing onto my arms with her nails. anyways she decides this is because of my computer and tries to rip it out of my wall. and I pick her up and move her out of my room like 3 times. also she is incredibly invested in high school drama and has no real friends.

"I went to high school with a girl who's parents were devout Christians. They went to church every weekend, went to church camps and met up with other church-goers on a regular basis for dinner parties.

She was an atheist, very intelligent, constantly getting top grades, incredibly sweet but quiet girl. Always dressed smartly, always turned up on time with all the correct work, never got in trouble for anything.

Being an atheist, she wasn't into all the church stuff her parents forced onto her, but she accepted it and didn't complain too much because that just wasn't her. She got top grades at the end of high school, then top grades at the end of college.

Then she went to university, and I think moving away from her parents and discovering her new-found freedom got to her head a little. Suddenly she was covered in piercings, dyed her hair black and has a reputation for sleeping around. She went to Amsterdam for a while last year (for obvious reasons), then dropped out of her course (some sort of medical sciences I think) and now works in a cafe doing very little else with her life.

I hope she pulls it together soon and finds something she is happy doing! It was just so weird seeing this high-achieving, studious girl suddenly do a complete 180, many of us believe getting away from her oppressive Christian parents had a lot to do with it. 

EDIT: I just want to add, I don't have any doubt that she's happier how she is as a person now - she's probably wanted to express herself like this for a long time and now finally can! But I know she currently isn't happy in her job and wants something more than cafe work, which I'm sure she will easily be able to achieve."

http://i.imgur.com/cbB84kU.jpg

This last image is a picture I took a few years back. Me and my brother were living back home for the summer after living at the other side of the country, and we decided that we needed to find a secluded place to smoke doobies; away from prying eyes. 
        So, we ventured into a densely wooded area that lays on a creek about 500 feet beyond the back of our home house. We found a large pocket of bamboo type stems and thought that it would be cool if we hollowed out the inside and created a den, with a good view of the river below. So we did that, and then hauled down an old wooden bench from our house and stuck it in there. 

I took this photograph whilst we were clearing the trees. I don't know why I did it. I guess I thought it would be nice to get a photograph that would remind me of that time (and the weather was sweet, which is a rarity where I come from). It turned out really well considering I used a phone that cost €40.

"Because that is exactly what they did. The ending was basically written the same time as the pilot. Which is fine if the show only lasted 1 or 2 seasons. The problem was over 8 years of writing and the character arcs evolved in a way that the writers could not imagine from day one. Who would have thought that Barney and Robin would have such chemistry? The writers didn't until they started to develop their characters over several seasons. 

Who would have thought that Ted could legitimately move on from Robin after the first couple of seasons? Again the writers didn't at first but over time they saw that was a natural progression of his character.

Sadly instead of seeing that their characters and story has moved far from where they originally planned they stubbornly chose to go back and reset what their characters were at the pilot. It was a a poor choice."

"I was a substitute teacher last school year and I worked the last two months at the same high school. I'm 23 and most of my students were 17-18, so I was worried that they wouldn't respect me, but that didn't happen....instead I had students hitting on me. 

One was acting flirty and I thought no way, I'm being paranoid, but then he was following behind me as we entered the classroom one day and out of the corner of my eye I saw him purposefully take a long stride so he could bump into my back. Then he put his hands on my waist and lingered their while saying ""ooh I'm sorry miss kaylajacs."" 

Then there was the student who called me ""sweetheart"" every time he saw me. I mean, that's friendly I guess, but he was in high school and I was his teacher who was five years older...it was uncomfortable.

Strangest one was when I wondered aloud why all the classroom doors were locked during the day (obnoxious because the student nearest the door had to constantly get up and open it for tardies, people coming back from bathroom, etc.) This kid with an anime sweatshirt and a messenger bag says loudly while making direct eye contact and grinning, ""because otherwise a SUCCUBUS could come in and take ADVANTAGE of me, you know?"" actually idk if that was even flirting or just a weird ass kid"

"I still whistle back to blackbirds when there's nobody around.

Growing up I lived in a pretty rural area and there wasn't much to do, and weren't many other kids that lived in walking distance. So I spent a lot of time on the swing set my dad built out of timber in the back yard. Climbing trees. Digging, filling and emptying buckets.

One summer I learned one of the sequences of a blackbird's song and could whistle it back to him. He'd then reply with the next phrase. If I only whistled the first half, he'd finish it for me. It was one of the stranges and most delightful relationships of my childhood, whislting back and forth with an unseen winged visitor as the light faded out of a day.

That blackbird will be long dead, and that swingset was miles away and has long been pulled down. But when I'm standing in my own little back yard, smoking a cigarette and listening to the evening, I still whistle that phrase to any blackbird that I hear singing."

"Hmm, not exactly.  Our satellite system is another physical server rack at our location where the movies (known as DCPs) are downloaded and stored (usually a week to a few days before release of the movie).  These are the actual movie files and they range from 100 to 300 GB in size.  

Once a movie is downloaded via satellite to the satellite server, we move any movie we have booked from that server to our local server, known as the LMS (library management system).  From there, as I explained in an earlier post, we move the movie files to each player.  

So, ELI5ish: Each projector is essentially a giant DVR.   Each player has a copy of the movie (in case we have to move movies to other theaters during the week).  The projectors run form a set schedule and play each movie when it's supposed to -- but it's not streaming.  It's playing from the hard drive array on the projector, just like your DVR at home plays your recorded TV shows from it's hard drive.  The only catch is, we need encrypted keys for each movie to allow us to play them.  "

There was an interesting if sad depiction of kids in Palo Alto on the TV show *Silicon Valley*, in the first season episode called ""Third Party Insourcing"".  I see that a lot around here, too, but Cambridge has very strong liberal credentials and fully half of the only high school in town is kids from public housing.  

So half the kids have a rocket up their ass and an Adderall problem, the other half of the kids are going to barely graduate and are selling weed.  OK, it's not literally that, but there are two extremes represented.

My elder daughter went straight to the rainbow-colored hair, rainbow of sexuality crowd, facial piercings and theater credentials.  My younger daughter is hanging out with the anime nerd crowd.  I would recommend some diversity for you.

I know your life will end if you don't get into Stanford, Caltech, or at the very least Berkeley, but regardless, I strongly recommend that you take a gap year.  Travel in Asia, join CityYear, anything. You need to get that your childhood was a pressure cooker and there's nothing wrong with cracking up a bit, and ultimately, you're the one who benefits by an excellent education, although you would have also benefitted by being able to smoke weed and have drama with a girlfriend or boyfriend like other teenagers.

Kids in Silicon Valley should get a lot more room to be kids, but there's no real appreciation of that.

"Your points are valid! I'm going off the version of the diary that I read (which did you?). I'm not sure which it was specifically, but it was an unedited version. It's been a while so my memory may be off, but what I remember is that her talking about being confused is about romance in general, and that she and Peter became more friendly but never fell in love. Regardless, though, I still dislike the passage being censored because, if we're honest, a part talking about same-gender attraction =/= something minor like what she had for breakfast. 

I had to study the play in eighth grade and absolutely hated it, though. It glossed over major aspects of Anne as an individual and instead made it, for the most part, a tragic luuuurve story, playing up the romance to an extent that wasn't in the diary. I dunno, it really frustrated me. It felt so disrespectful to her memory for some reason. I'm not against fictionalising historical events, but I feel like it's still kinda shitty to make the story of a young girl in the Holocaust more about romance than her life and thoughts.

I'm sure there's exceptions, like black people having albino babies who later in life father black children, but whatever."
"The actual rate is only around 1-3%. The rate varies depending on socio-economic background and country. Recent geneological studies have also showed that this is the rate throughout most of history. The 30% rate thrown around usually refers to fathers with low parental confidence.

"Client was charged with child abuse. She had a history of drug use and was married to a man that was hitting her and her child. One of the allegations from CPS was that the husband had hit the child with a baseball bat. 

So, my client had criminal charges against her and her ex-husband (the biological father) was petitioning for custody of the child and termination of my client's parental rights.

After 3 years of untangling this entire situation, we came to a resolution. My client separated from her second husband (the abuser), went to in-patient rehab, lost custody but retained generous visitation rights. 

Two months after the case was over, I got a phone call from my client. From prison. Apparently, her plan all along was to ""pretend"" to leave her second husband and reconnect with him when the case was over. That's fine. But, she also kidnapped her child during one of her visits and took her to Florida to ""start over"" with her second husband. Authorities couldn't find her for weeks. 

She received a suspended sentence, probation and termination of her parental rights. I seriously hope I never hear from her again. If I do, she will be the first client I refuse to represent. I hate her.

"When I was 13 our neighbors went on a cruise for a week and while they were gone I let myself into their house through their back sliding glass door by the pool that they left unlocked (they left their *pool* unlocked?  Goddamn it mom, no, shut up and listen).

I had myself an all-week jackoff-athon extravaganza-fest on their bed in a pile of the MILF wife's panties that I took out of her panty drawer.  I used their lube they had stashed in there, a little red tube called Joy Jelly.

When the week was up I took a pair of her panties home with me and kept it in my closet to use as a jack rag for *years*.  My mom ended up finding them when I was a junior in high school and she assumed they belonged to my girlfriend at the time (now my wife).

**TL;DR -- Did some light to medium breaking and entering at our neighbor's house when I was 13, jerked off with the MILF neighbor's panties while she and her family were on a week-long cruise.**"

"I have two thoughts about why this is the case.

1) They're probably shy, or otherwise unsure of themselves, and are hesitant to make any kind of move for fear of rejection.

2) People, and women especially, are afraid of showing interest sometimes for a subconscious fear of things escalating too quickly.  That is, they may not know you well enough to be sure you're not a psycho rapist/murderer/bunny-eater/etc.  They probably wouldn't even be able to articulate it in the moment, it's a subconscious thing.

If I can make a suggestion, I'd say that if you're interested in a gal but unsure of her response, you could casually initiate some banter.  Compliment her outfit, ask about her shoes, whatever.  Get her talking to you and she'll relax and you'll be able to read signs of mutual interest, if they exist.  

Obviously, the dance is complex, but there seems to be this atmosphere of fear around this whole type of situation - ladies afraid of physical harm, men afraid of being seen as ""creepy"", and all parties being afraid of rejection.  All legitimate, but we need to start working around these things, I think."

"The worst part is, there's so much in my life I would have to break it down by relative. 

Grand mother: Abused me: Chased me onto a trampoline while going underneath it with a knife and trying to stab up at me as she couldn't get it. Frying my pet fish and trying to make me eat it. Locking me outside the house when dad went to work (8 hour workdays in the southern heat) with only the water in the dog bowl to drink. 

Dad &amp; Uncle - When I left town to visit my mom for 2 weeks, there was a lady named Diana dating my Uncle. Came back from out of town and she was now my Step Mom. Pretty WTF. Dad only did it out of desperation, with 2 young girls, he thought they needed a mother. Diana was in it for the money, left for Mexico a few months later with a younger guy that had been her ""best friend"" the entire time. So that was the end of the Step Mother. 

Mother - Later in life, abusive druggie. Won't get into the physical &amp; mental abuse, just too long. Got little sister hooked on cocaine. Convinced me to repeat my senior year of high school because we needed the money. (After father's death, who had primary custody, my sister &amp; I got some money from the government until we turned 18 or graduated high school.) The worst thing she did when younger while on a rare &amp; infrequent weekend visitation with her was getting drunk with Step Dad. They both were refilling zippo lighters at the time and something was said to make her start spraying him down with lighter fluid, and then start chasing him around with a lighter trying to catch him on fire screaming, ""BURN SCARE CROW, BURN!!!"" I was in elementary school. 

Step Dad - Other than a drunk, he chose to leave me crazy mom a year to the day after my dad's death. We came home to school to mom being in the hospital for a liver biopsy (She had Hep C which helped to kill my father). The house was ransacked, all electronics from living room &amp; den were gone. Called up mom &amp; the bank account with the money from my sister &amp; I was cleaned out. So kinda rough bit of time there. 

Friend- I currently have a friend who is staying with her husband. She is former military and her husband is dishonorably discharged and in jail for 6 years for attempting to solicit a minor through the internet. Also, he slept with 20 women while they were married &amp; throughout their various deployments. While she was pregnant, he gave her an STD. The fact that she is going to stand by her husband drives me crazy. "

Well, my wife's sister likes to be a bitch and harass people and one day she started drilling him on arithmetic, mind you he was getting ready for a pre-calculus test at the time, and she starts asking him about Arithmetic.

She asked one question, he just looked at her in dead silence, turned and walked away without saying a word.

"Actually cachexia  is a condition where the body ""eats himself"" ( this is the simple explanation). What happens to patients with cancer ( mostly on terminal phases)  is that the cancer metabolism is so high that it can't be compensated by what we eat and so the body ends up depleting his fat reserves and consumes whatever is left of the body such muscles etc ( note : fat and muscle depletion start sort of on the same time , just that we prefer to use fat instead of proteins from muscles for our metabolism so the last resists a bit more ) . Anyway all of this happens during cancer and not it has been eliminated and the patient can gain weight after  that, but it is a bit hard to for obvious reasons.  
Aside from all this explanation in this case there may be other reasons to why he can't gain weight, like the case of an intestinal or gastric resection to remove the tumor."

"I think it's still worth mentioning that men and women are socialized towards different fields (women are heavily encouraged to take on careers in childcare and social work, which coincidentally have much lower salaries than the STEM careers men are often conditioned to pursue), not to mention that occupations tend to decrease in value when women enter in large numbers (i.e. biology, fashion, etc.). You can see this in Russia, where doctors, a largely female-dominated field in Russia, have very low salaries and are considered less prestigious compared to doctors in the United States, where doctors are largely male.

"I was heading home once [at night] and I decided to take an Uber. My Uber driver takes a look at me and says ""You're going home?"" and I reply ""Yeah Thanks."" during the ride he keeps looking at me and tries to speed. Automatically I was scared and felt uncomfortable and so I asked him ""Sir, is there something wrong?"" and so he looks at me and says ""Do you believe in ghosts?"" and I laughed and said ""No way. I live in front of a funeral home and nothing has ever happened."" then he stays quiet for a moment until he responds with ""My family was big on spirituality and I can feel something waiting for you at home."" at this point I thought the driver was just being creepy and foolish so I said ""oh damn."" finally when I arrived home he literally sped out of sight. I get home and with the little light coming from my window from the outside, I see this weird shadow run across the room. My first instinct was that it was probably a shadow caused by an object outside. I put my things down and proceeded to my room when I start seeing an indent on my bed as though someone was sitting down and this is when I started to freak out. I literally froze as I saw the indent move towards my pillow. I closed my eyes and said ""get out!"" and I swear to God I heard a small laugh descend from my room to the hallway and then it was gone. 

This happened actually a few months ago. I called a priest and had him bless the house. Apparently there was a wake occurring that day and I guess the ghost had an agenda before embarking on a journey to the after life? "

"asking a girl you just met to flash you, and also talking about how you can suck your own dick.

-accidentally added a guy on facebook (friend of a friend, seemed like a nice guy, somehow friend requested him without noticing.) asked me out for coffee, wasn't really interested in dating the guy but seemed like we could be friends so i obliged.

-at the coffee shop he asked me a question at one point, and in the middle of my answer completely turned his head and started listening to someone else's conversation (they mentioned a place he volunteers at), then talked to that person for a good 10-15 minutes while i just sat there. 

-we then went to get pizza (i should've just left then) and he randomly starts talking about his penis and how he is able to reach it with his own mouth. it was extra uncomfortable because this place was really loud and we were seated at a bar so he had to keep leaning over and basically whispering to me about sucking his own dick. i was not really talking or responding by this point. 

-we leave soon after and he walks me to my car, where he asks if i'll quickly flash him (by the way it is still daytime and raining lightly.) i of course say no. ""how about a kiss then?"" i say no. i reluctantly hug him and head on my way.

he did message me a couple days later to apologize for being weird, and a few months later he left facebook completely. it was a really strange experience, the dude seemed totally normal and polite when we chatted on facebook.

I absolutely hate society's attitude towards makeup. Because if we wear it, we're trying to put on a fake face; if we don't wear it, we're lazy slobs.

Take the recent Alicia Keys ordeal, for example. She decided she doesn't want to wear makeup anymore and kudos to her for that. But it fuels the opinion that makeup has to be something wrong, deceiving or shameful that we women do to hide ourselves from others. Guess what, I actually like wearing makeup on some occasions, because it makes me feel better, more powerful, or whatever. But I can go out without it as well. 

Bottom line is, just let people wear what they please and stop being such an asshole about it. "

People draw art and write stories about these creatures, mostly violent NSFW stuff in which the Fluffies are tortured, placed in horrible situations or just generally have a miserable existence. There are also cute/heartwarming pictures and stories about them, sad/scary stories and relatively clean cartoony comedy pieces

It's a strange niche fandom within a fandom within a bigger fandom with very little basis and no consistent source of new membership, but it manages to persist and grow. A lot of it is terrible, but there are some very talented artists and writers who have contributed to it."

It could be just as simple as it made them laugh and left a good impression. Either way, think that it is unfair to say something isn't the best, when in literature, it's all subjective. I love Eragon, my friends hate it. I hate sitting and reading poems, which are still literature, my friends adore it.

"Oh god, that reminds me of probably the cuntiest thing I've ever done.  

There was this lass Mel, and she was best friends with a dog-rough girl I'd dated, so she thought that we were friends. She rang me out of the blue one night to speak with me about her mostly unrequited crush on my mate Tom, and I wasn't happy to get a call from her — I listened for a while, bored, whilst she got very emotional, and then at some point the conversation turned to a plan a bunch of us had to go out for a grown-up meal (we were about 16, going to Topo Gigio for three course Italian was the height of sophistication in 1990s Nottingham for us). I asked her what she thought she'd get, and she said she'd start with the soup.  
I don't know what happened, I think I had a mental breakdown at this point, because otherwise I'm just an irredeemable cunt. I'd long said that her greasy hair and forehead made her like a seal, and I just blurted out ""are you going to get the fish soup?"" She was a vegan, and was confused by this, but I carried on: ""Are you getting the fish soup, Mel? Are you going to scoop the fish soup up with your hands? You can't come for a meal with us, Mel, you're going to scoop up fish soup with your hands, and eat it like a seal. You'll get us thrown out, Mel!""
 
And then I barked down the phone at her, like a seal. For at least 30 seconds, till she hung up, and we obviously never passed another pleasant word again."

"**Day 01:** Our subject - Dan, let's call him - voices a reluctant intention to get his first-ever job. Dan is nineteen at this point, and in college with an undeclared major.

**Day 04:** Dan submits his first-ever job application.

**Day 05:** Feeling smug about his ""accomplishment,"" Dan shows off a copy of the job application to a few people (including me). It is riddled with typos, snarky jokes, and outright criticisms. Everyone predicts that Dan will not hear back from the hiring manager. Dan sneers and declares, ""Nobody cares about that shit.""

**Day 09:** Dan submits his second-ever job application.

**Day 11:** After receiving pressure from his parents, Dan enlists the help of an editor - me - in preparing his third-ever job application. I tell him that the job in question will require him to ""care about that shit,"" seeing as it's focused on data-entry.

**Day 12:** Dan is offered an interview.

**Day 13:** Dan is offered a job. He is scheduled to begin work on the following Monday.

**Day 17:** Dan is fired from his job on the first day. Here is his explanation of what happened, as best I can remember it:

------

&gt; ""It was fucking bullshit, man. Like, everyone makes mistakes sometimes, so what's the big fucking deal? It's not my fault they have fucking sticks up their fucking asses. Fuck!""

------

**Day 18:** The story of Dan's firing eventually comes to include the fact that he had been lascivious to the company's receptionist, and that he had been late (by an unspecified amount of time) getting back from his lunch break.

**Day 21:** Dan submits his fourth-ever job application.

**TL;DR: Sleazy slacker solicits secretary, is sacked.**"

But mom and dad insist he is fine. The healthiest he ever was was right after he had a double ear infection and tonsillitis. Whatever antibiotics they gave him cleared him right up and he was the happiest baby since he was finally able to breathe. It was a great week.

The last image shows the following message: 

""This Voyager spacecraft was constructed by the United States of America. We are a community of 240 million human beings among the more than 4 billion who inhabit the planet Earth. We human beings are still divided into nation states, but these states are rapidly becoming a single global civilization.
We cast this message into the cosmos. It is likely to survive a billion years into our future, when our civilization is profoundly altered and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed. Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, some--perhaps many--may have inhabited planets and spacefaring civilizations. If one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents, here is our message:
This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.

To have the irrational paranoia that the entire world is glaring at you, mocking you, and judging you, and then becoming barely able to function should fit the criteria of mental illness. My old roommate use to have terrible anxiety, and he told me a lot about it. It seemed horrible, glad he finally found a medication that worked for him.

Went over to an uncles house once. We didn't really frequent their place because they lived about an hour from us. I had to go to the bathroom and found out they were pissing and shitting in a bucket like it was completely normal. One time they were at our house and one of my cousins was in the living room watching TV. He was laying on the floor and instead of getting up and going to the bathroom he just laid there and pissed his pants like it was totally normal. Kid was like 10. So many other stories about them but those stick out.

"It just begs a few questions; Why they would need to clean their vulva and/or anus *in the back of the dad's van*? How would the dad check for the smell, (considering females don't give off strong vaginal odor until they hit puberty, and even then it could take months without cleaning for someone to be able to smell it from a ways away)? Why would the girl's first concern be her father just getting angry, as opposed to him wanting her to stay healthy?

It's just got too many red flags to not be suspicious. "

"Growing up, one of my friends and her family had this evil little dog (I'm a die hard animal lover, especially dogs, but this one was mentally ill or something). Now and again it would fly off the handle and nip or bit one of the 7 kids they had. I remember one day specifically, it bit my friend so her finger was sliced open to the bone. The mom made excuses for the dog, my friend was too used to this shit by that point to argue about it, and the mom SEWED HER FINGER SHUT HERSELF. All the while I sat there wondering what the fuck is going on, and continuing to talk and gossip with my friend and her mom. I mean, yeah stitches would have been expensive, but I'm amazed she didn't get a huge infection. Litteraly nothing changed with the dog, and some of her brothers were still just sitting on the couch and petting it as they watched tv. I obviously didn't dare go near it.

Also. The whole family believed in things like energy healing and chakras and whatnot (that's not the weird part) one day I tripped over one of their hundreds of potted plants, and ripped up one of its enormous leaves. The mom had me sit by the potted plant and ""feel what I've done to it, and apologize until it forgave me."" My friends younger sister apparently could see people's chakras and the plants ""energy,"" and litteraly sat with me until the plants energy ""turned back to a happy color.""

"Funny story: I had a delayed flight in South Dakota due to a snowstor. and ended up almost missing my connection in Chicago, with about 5-7 minutes left to go through half the airport I start sprinting like hell, I literally crash into the desk at the  departure gate right after they closed it completely out of breath and try to explain through gestures and broken words that I had to get into the plane, there were two attendants there, the woman started saying that she was sorry but the gate was already closed while the man was a little more interested in the backstory, so I explain to him that I got there with the delayed flight from Sioux Falls and he checks something on his screen.
He looks up to me and says something along the lines of ""How did you manage to get here? Fuck it, I don't care, you deserve to get on that plane"" which, after a month away from home, are the most beautiful words a man can hear.
He then makes some calls on his walkie talkie and escorts me inside the plane, I fucking loved that man.

TL;DR: Running like my life depended on it actually saved me a day or more of waiting at the airport because thanks to it I impressed some guy."

"I just checked the wikipedia page. It reflects the language and known vocabulary of the speaker, so in essence it's gibberish made up words constructed from preexisting language. Call me a hypocrite because I'm devoutly religious (LDS), but the power of suggestion is real. Just look at the placebo effect, if you convince someone of something enough, they'll begin to believe, act, and draw their own conclusions about something false. 

Simply replace ""these sugar pills will cure my fever"" with ""Whenever I receive revelation from God, it will come in nonsensical language I can't interpret"". I always thought the concept was rather superficial as I believe that God gives us revelation in a more modest reverent manner, but to claim my beliefs are any more legitimate outside my personal beliefs and experiences would make me a hypocrite."
"AND HE ADMITTED IT. That's what killed me. When you end a relationship, you spend so much time going over and over what happened, and you (most likely) come to some erroneous conclusions. Not this guy... he admitted he was only sexually and emotionally attracted to her when she was depressed. Fucking sick. "
"Actually met him at the World Jamboree of Scouting. He took his fame and decided to give back to the community. Here are some of the initiatives he has started:

On **September 19, 2010**, Mike Rowe and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers started a campaign called ""I Make America"". The campaign aims to create jobs in the manufacturing sector by encouraging infrastructure investment and export agreements. The group argues that this will improve the economy and global competitiveness of the United States.

In **May 2011**, Rowe testified on the issue before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation

Rowe sent a **letter to President Obama** at the start of his first term offering to help promote the 3 million ""shovel-ready"" jobs promised during the campaign, suspecting it might be a tough sell, ""given the country's then-current relationship with the shovel."" He did not receive a reply. During the 2012 presidential election, Rowe contacted GOP candidate Mitt Romney and appeared with him on September 26, 2012, at a campaign event in Ohio. Romney explained to those in attendance, ""He's non partisan, he's not here to endorse me, he's not here to add support to one campaign or another,"" Romney said of his guest. ""He's here to talk about his ideas about how to help America create more jobs.""

In **Spring 2013**, mikeroweWORKS launched its newest initiative, Profoundly Disconnected. Rowe states, ""many of the best opportunities that exist today require a skill, not a diploma. The purpose of this site is to promote that simple truth."" While in high school in 1979, Rowe saw a poster in his guidance counselor's office that read ""Work Smart, Not Hard"". He hated it so much, he changed it to ""Work Smart AND Hard""; he now prints such posters and wants them hanging all over the country to get people to change the way hard work is perceived.

Despite his criticism of student loans and the rising cost of tuition, he has carried on a partnership with Universal Technical Institute. UTI is a **For-Profit trade school** investigated by the Senate. In its investigation, the Senate found that UTI did not provide a better education than a community college, but charged significantly more

TIL skedjule is wrong. 
"Moving to a growth mindset can be phenomenally powerful in changing as a person. However as an extension of this I feel is also important is that sometimes it takes the help of other people to move to a growth mindset. A fixed mindset can feel so fixed that you think it feels unchangeable. When that happens, you need to get help. 

It is important to remember that your frame of mind can **always change**, but **you** aren't always capable of doing it alone. Try to avoid having '*I need to move to a growth mindset*' just become a new stick with which to beat yourself. Bad memories and trauma stick around because on some level a person feels like they could or should take control of the consequences. If you are invested in feeling in control of the uncontrollable, then you may well be the kind of person who will just bring an unhelpful approach to a new way of dealing with things.

If you really think about it, this is almost self-evident. If the person you are right now hasn't been able to change things for the better and feels like it doesn't know how, then *obviously* you need the input of another person. Take the growth idea to your friends, family, or someone professional like a doctor or a therapist: how can my relationship with people around me change to help me change, or can these people be the mental nutrients I need to nourish my mind?

Very few people have a complete understanding of what the cause of their own problems are, and the voice in your head that explains the story of how you became who you are is very rarely accurate."

"The basic idea is to prevent prosecutorial abuse.  Without some form of Double-Jeopardy protection, prosecutors could keep ""finding"" evidence after you're acquitted and keep dragging you into court, essentially punishing you by keeping you in custody or in the court system into perpetuity.  And that's to say nothing of the cost associated with a successful legal defense.  

I don't know if you follow much US criminal news (I can't imagine most outsiders would), but prosecutorial abuse is pretty bad in the US, even **with** laws against double-jeopardy.  Our system still doesn't require prosecution to address any exculpatory evidence they unearth during the discovery phase, and while it does technically require prosecution to present all findings, there's no system in place to ensure that's actually happening.

IIRC, the Duke University Lacrosse rape case was one high-profile case in which the prosecutor knowingly sat on exculpatory evidence, and almost ruined these students' lives for career benefit.  Imagine somebody like that being able to ""find"" new evidence every time an acquittal is reached, and then begin the process all over again.  Hence, Double-Jeopardy laws.

It also began in direct response to the Articles of Confederation (the US' failed first ruling document), which did not contain this protection.  Its inclusion in the Bill of Rights was a direct response to the failure of the AoC to protect the rights of the people.

The casualty of this is, of course, that once acquitted, there's virtually nothing a guilty party can do or say to be brought to justice.  "

The whole internet scares me that way; whatever you post could be forever. Snapchat is the exact opposite. It's a relief. I don't have to ponder or worry I just snap and walk away"
That's ridiculous. The whole point is that they subjectively don't find that one thing fun. Doesn't mean they don't have other interests. There isn't anything universally regarded as fun.

"I was going through a slutty phase after ending a 3-year relationship. I had been using OKC to meet men and there was this one I'd been talking to for months. He was pretty awkward and not very attractive, but nice and kind of funny. One night after months of mild flirting on my end and focused attention on his, I finally decided to invite him over. I was extremely horny for some reason and felt bad for all of the teasing. 


The sex was terrible, sloppy. And I think he was nervous because he both had difficulty maintaining an erection and then finishing. Finally, after my best effort to get him off, including over a half hour of oral, I gave up. I indicated that I had an early morning and I thought he'd leave, but instead he camped on my bed and beat off for ALMOST AN HOUR, determined to ""get his"". I just got ready for bed, turned off the light, and tried to sleep with the bed shaking rhythmically. Finally, he finished and left. 


Tl;dr: don't fuck people because you feel sorry for them and certainly don't let them hang out and jerk it for an hour afterwards when they can't cum."

"""Tim"" was a kid in my Jr high math class and a huge fuck up. Terrible student. Gave little effort. Wouldn't accept help from other students or teachers unless they were just giving him the answers.  After some digging I found out that his dad, who was about fifty, had divorced the mother and remarried a lady about six years older than Tim.  They'd actually been in the same school together at one point as the school was k-8. 

Since school wasn't really his thing and his home life was a hot mess, he found his enjoyment in wreaking havoc in the small town - shooting out streetlights, stealing candy from the gas station, knocking over mailboxes.  He started breaking into the school at night. Sometimes he would just go to play games in the computer lab. Other times he would be more destructive, like when broke into the cafeteria and egged the walls and smeared butter over the floor. He finally got caught one night when he broke in while it was raining and left footprints. 

I heard a few years later he date raped a student that had been a grade behind him. The girl didn't press charges as he was actually like a step cousin by marriage and the family pressed her not to. "

The last race is absolute perfection in every way, and the final stretch of the lap is a kaleidoscope of talent. 

The Wachowski siblings could have gone the trendy route of making a gritty, grimdark reboot, but they were absolutely insistent on maintaining the look and style of the original cartoon. God bless them."

Public executions and death penalties in nations like Saudi Arabia are more linked than what the ""progessives"" believe. When they receive information that contradicts their assessment of Islam as victimized, they plug their ears and wail like children. For people who love to focus on majority/minority dynamics, they sure picked the powerful majority here, and they hide behind that fact, spitting out the obvious that those actions arent indicative of the whole thing."

I was probably in middle school and me and my friend were going to the movies. We bought 2 tickets but before we could get into the theater I lost mine. So I took my friends ticket and entered the theater and kept the ticket stub in my pocket. Then waited 5 minutes and went up the the ticketing guy and said that I lost my stub and I wanted to buy some popcorn (The snack area was outside the booth in this theater) and asked if he could just remember my face. He said okay so I went outside gave me friend the stub and bought some popcorn and enjoyed the movie.

"a story I've been told: When Sean Connery was first cast as James Bond, he was nervous about how many scenes he had wearing a tuxedo. His previous acting experience had been as blue-collar characters. So the producer bought him a tailored tuxedo a few weeks before shooting was due to start, and told Sean to wear it literally everywhere. Wear it while shopping, while gardening, while working out, while sleeping, have it on every moment he was not actually washing himself. And by the time filming began, Connery was totally comfortable wearing a tuxedo."

"Speaking from gun advocates side on this issue, part of the problem is how politicized everything gets in America. We won't be banning guns outright since it is a constitutional right, however many people are opposed to more regulations because they are never bipartisan.  I've read in here about both sides in Australia coming together over this issue and that would never happen here. It would start off with one side coming up with a crazy rule then it getting beaten down and mutilated until it is something that makes people feel better about themselves, but does nothing to solve the initial problem they were trying to and only ends up causing more frustrations for legal gun owners. 


Take a look at some of the dumb gun laws we have in America. They were put in place to help curb gun violence, but many don't make any sense at all and were created and passed by people who have no knowledge on the subject. "

Sure you're potentially giving some coffee away, but that is a small price to pay and it can be limited to once a day or something.

Now, the person who stole the stamp has, at most, two months of free coffee left and he won't dare show the stamp to others because they would steal it back and get THREE months free coffee. That or the thief returns it himself and gets three months free. Either way, in three months MAX the problem is solved and business can proceed as usual."

"I was a ride operator at a decent park that eventually was bought by six flags.  Ran a wooden coaster that was the fourth or fifth biggest in the country at the time.  The fastest turn had a bit of a design flaw as the whole track would shift about a foot side to side.  I remember watching about six professionals watching it from the exit ramp and taking notes and drawing sketches.  

Don't recall it ever being fixed or anything.  Always made me wonder.

We had a guy with balls of steel actually engage the manual brakes at the bottom of the first hill.  There would be riders on it as well - train was going super slow, but I guess in hindsight someone could have gotten slightly hurt from the abrupt stop.  Would do it periodically which would give us a couple hours of nothing to do while they ran diagnostics on it.  Heck, he did it once with the engineers present to confuse them more.  He was amazing.  I didn't have the courage to do it, and thought it was pretty crummy to the people riding the thing.  We'd have to manually release them and walk them back into the station.

"Another thing I noticed is that Reddit gives fucking shit advice when it comes to early age of relationships/dating.

Like for fucks sake, the poor 18 or 19 year old just probably wrote out this entire thing looking for hope or some answer to his question, and all you're going to do is sit there, call him a creep and then downvote it cause it sounds like a young person wrote it.

Yes, a young person did write it you dimwit. Telling them to move on is possibly the least helpful advice I could ever fucking hope to get in that situation. I'd rather be told different examples and have people actually read the context. 99% of the people who browse the new dating section on r/relationships literally call other people either nice guys or creeps, and for fucks sake it's annoying after reading so many of them after a while.

Usually I see either, ""Idk if I should ask X out [19]"" or ""She rejected me what do I do? [19]"", and honestly I'd rather see either of these two moreso than just ""move on"".

1st situation you take a shot. 2nd, you tell them to distance themselves a bit, stay friends, and if that hurts too much just be upfront and honest with them and tell them you need to leave the friendship for a bit. You're fucking 18 or 19, chances are pretty up there that she's going to change as she goes through college. This is just me assuming right here, but I think that if you also grow with your friends, you two might grow closer or farther apart. Maybe not now, but a year or two from freshman year when they were all ""I don't want anything with you"" they might go, ""Shit, they're a great person, they've grown with me, and it might work out. I think I like them"" and boom, you got someone who's there for you.

Honestly just hate reading that subreddit's advice now. Literally assumes the worst and just insults people whenever they get the chance. It's like the people over there just want the poster to become sad, angry and try to ruin people's lives."

"Within a week of each other, my dad had a heart attack requiring 3 days of hospitalization and my mom broke her wrist and required surgery.

This was pre obama care which they have now and pay an affordable monthly premium. My dad has parkinsons now and required major back surgery just to be able to move. Obama care covers the cost. Without it my dad would have simply been left to wither and die.

Health care in this country is insane, but potentially on the right path assuming Obama care is not rescinded. In which case my dad will likely just be left to pass away."

"The Lightning played with a forechecking strategy of 1-3-1, meaning there is one player up ice, three in the neutral zone (the area in the center between the blue lines) and one who plays back in the defensive zone. Normally the one player up ice would put some pressure on the other team and force them to play the puck forward. Tampa Bays strategy was to not pressure the flyers and cause a turn over near center ice because they would have more players blocking passes than the flyers would have receiving them. The reason this could work is because you can't really score goals without advancing the puck so teams would usually try and advance it and go right into their neutral zone trap. In this video we see the flyers mock this strategy by refusing to advance the puck and Tampa bay refusing to properly forecheck (pressure the flyers into advancing the puck). It makes for very boring hockey and eliminates Tampa bays strategy, hence why the fans are booing.

Hope that clears it up some!"

"I am a gun owner in Australia. This is a great question glad to see its been asked. I will just add that I legally own a gun. I have friends that legally own guns. We have pistols, rifles and shotguns. Lever, bolt, break. Here's the thing. To get them you just have to not be a criminal. That's basically it. Our laws are greatly exaggerated abroad. Everyone has to take an 8 hour saftey course. Pass a background check. And that's it you get your gun. No semi autos with the exception of hand guns. Hand guns require an additional saftey course and license. Again only preqeset is don't be a criminal. I'm an Australian who believes in gun control. I don't need a gun but I get to have one because I act responsibly with it. Thats the bottom line. You abuse it you SHOULD lose it. "

"While I don't agree with the idea of advancing students who aren't prepared, it is more complicated than you give credit to.

Teachers can recommend a student be retained only for parents to complain and administrators (of some level or another) to push the child ahead.

Perhaps a better system would be to respect the sacrifices many teachers make for their students and to systematically support differentiated instruction so students can stay together socially while they play catch up academically. (Assuming this is about American public education, I think a big part of the problem is the lack of a realization that teaching is a serious profession that deserves more prestige than is currently afforded it.)

"Yeah, that's a tough situation, but when dealing with any collectibles, especially high price ones, you need multiple forms of authentication. Letters of provenience or authenticity are meaningless and can be faked in 10 seconds. You either need autograph experts who can compare what you have to known examples, or other knowledgeable experts who can match something to the person.

Unfortunately when it comes to collectibles, most of the time its almost impossible to prove with 100% certainty that something is real. Stories can be BS, letters can be fake, items can be reproduced with 100% accuracy so that even the best experts can be fooled. There are fake Picasso's known to be hanging in prestigious museums. "

"One side of my family came to America in the 1600's, we have records and family bibles detailing the family trees and events of everyone's lives etc all the way. By the early 1700's, they had land, and slaves. By the time the civil war rolled around, my family had over 200 slaves, and a very large plantation.

When the fighting came near, the women and children were sent (with slaves) and all of the family's valuables, jewelry, silverware, heirlooms, basically everything of monetary value, plus the family bibles and records, and deeds, etc, and went to bury (the slaves did the burying, of course) all of this on the plantation, to hide it from the Union soldiers. They ended up keeping the deeds and records and paperwork, and burying everything of monetary value. As luck would have it, no one was able to return to dig up our ""treasure"" if you will, for several years. They forgot where it was buried. Basically every descendant since has taken a crack at finding it, including my great uncle who went all over the land with an excavator in the 80's, but no one has found it yet. 

We still have the land, but all of heirlooms and valuables were lost, the big house burned to the ground in the early 1900's. "

Not true. While most individual NATO members participated in the Korean War, NATO, as an organization, was not involved.

"This is, apparently, a big problem in schools. At least in my children's school (but I've been told many stories about other ones as well) the faculty will notify the parents that the child has issues, whether it be learning issues or behavioral issues, and the parents do not want to admit it. My daughter has problems, and when I met with the school faculty to go over what I can do to help her, they were actually surprised. 

My other daughter was attacked a few weeks ago by a student who has quite the reputation of being violent. He tried to stab her in the stomach with a spork. When I found out, I demanded a meeting between the faculty and the child's parents as this wasn't the first time he had attacked my daughter. The parents were given a list (no joke, three pages long) of all the incidents involving their little maniac, and proceeded to try to blame EVERY SINGLE ONE on someone else. They refused to believe that their ""precious boy, who is just a little precocious"" could do any of this. We were just out to get him. To stifle his creativity. It took everything I had not to scream at this delusional woman. I asked her how she could explain away him attempting to stab another child. She said he was having a bad day because they ran out of his favorite cereal, so he couldn't be held responsible for what he did. He was having a bad day, see? My answer was ""really? When my kids have a bad day, they sulk a little then talk it out with me. Not try to assault other people."" But now I was attacking her boy and she didn't want to hear it. He was suspended and they informed the parents that he was not allowed to return next year.

The guidance counselor told this is normal. They deal with parents like this all the time. I couldn't imagine being in that much denial. This kid I'd going to be a monster in a few years. His parents will blame everyone else and when he ends up in jail, it'll be the judges fault. Not the 16 people he murdered because he couldn't have his captain crunch that morning."

Walking by anyone or being in their line of vision and feeling like if they laugh or whisper its about you.

Unable to confidently progress in life without a nagging, irrational fear of all social interactions:
Need to order food? Nervous agitation. If you're lucky you can have someone order for you. Want to ask a question in class or talk within a group? You wait for the ""right"" timing, and contemplate how stupid or necessary your comment is, ultimately deciding against it. Oh you can't find something in the store? Look there's an employee, why don't you ask for help? Nah. You rather spend an extra 25mins walking around searching instead of asking.

Its not being able to do something as basic as starting, maintaining or continuing a conversation/greeting. It's like, do you even English? You turn people off because of awkward conversation flow, posture, and lack of eye contact. You may also abruptly end conversations and leave people confused.

It's walking down the street, avoiding people's eyes by staring at the ground. It's feeling like you barely know how to walk when cars drive by. You feel like a new born ostrich.. looking at the floor and walking oddly.

It's your body tensing up even in calm situations like a bus ride. You sit there enjoying your music when you realize your shoulders are raised and your brow stern. (Picture a surprised, or nervous face expression).

In short, it's a repetitive, irrational fear that grips your being. Any task gets made 10x harder than it should be because of this fear of embarassment, of people's cruel reactions, and of having to do anything that involves interacting with other humans... and when you finally have to interact, whatever it may be for, there's this never ending dread looming."

"If you're a girl, wondering about a guy, then you can be pretty sure if he likes spending time with you that he is interested. Does he choose to sit next to you instead of others. Does he call/text you just to say ""hi"".  Does he try to make you laugh or impress you in some way. Guys are easy... If we hang around, and you are attractive relative to him, then he is interested. 

If you're a guy (I'm guessing you are) then it's a bit more tricky. Does she initiate physical contact?  touching your arm and such. Does she laugh at your jokes, even when they aren't that funny?  Those are some signs, but they could be intentional flirtation to make you like her. A lot of girls (younger ones mostly) really want you to like them.... Even if they don't like you in that way. Everyone is like this, but when girls figure out that they can do things to make others like them, it can become a powerful thing to play with. Most of the time it isn't even intentional, it is just behavior that gets positive responses, and are then reinforced. At a certain age, women realize this power can be a curse and stop exercising it willy nilly. About mid twenties, when she appears interested, she probably is. 

So there are a lot of factors to consider. What's the age group, what gender. Honestly though, it doesn't matter. If you are interested, then make a move. You'll hate yourself if you don't give it a go. The worst thing is a little passing embarrassment... Which is absolutely nothing compared with the regret for all the opportunities you see in retrospect that you were too cowardly to take. Don't wait either, do it now.  Opportunity has a way of disappearing.  

Take it from me.  You don't want to look back in twenty years with regret at all the people you never had the guts to approach. Though I should add that you should probably take an honest look at yourself and this other person. Are you attractive enough for that person to be interested?  If so, go for it. If not, maybe hit the gym and make yourself more attractive, then go for it. "

I don't practice criminal law, but a good friend who does put it like this: his job is to make absolutely goddamn sure that, if the prosecution is going to win, they're going to win properly, convincingly, and in a manner that is not susceptible to appeal for stupid avoidable mistakes.  For innocent/borderline/unknown clients, this means that IF the prosecution wins, they did a better job than his best effort.  He hasn't had very many clients convicted who he believed to be innocent, ever.  Very, very, very few, in fact.  For guilty clients, he puts up the strongest defense he possibly can, and this makes the conviction very hard to successfully appeal.  A vigorous defense calls for a rock solid prosecution, and if the prosecutors overcome that vigorous defense, the guilty party is likely to go to jail and stay there.

That's not to say he punts on sentencing, or whatever, obviously - he is a great attorney and does a great job through all phases of representation.  But for a defense attorney who really believes the client is guilty and thinks they should go to jail, forcing the prosecution to convincingly and properly win is more effective long term than some scummy tactic that will fall apart on appeal.

Edit - and no, for the most part a defense attorney can't or won't just fire a client if he thinks he's guilty.  Can't, if he's a PD, and won't, if he's getting paid regardless.  Contingent fees for criminal defense are illegal (or at the very least a violation of professional ethics that will have the bar on your ass faster than you can call Saul), so it's pretty much always either the former or latter"

""10. Truls Hellevik


The Byford Dolphin is a semi-submersible drilling rig which is infamous for having many serious accidents. In 1983, four divers were in the decompression chamber when it explosively decompressed from a pressure of nine atmospheres to just one. Truls Hellevik had his organs, spine and limbs ejected at a fraction of a second. At the same time, his remains were thrust through the narrow gap in the chamber door, causing fragments of his body to be found all over the rig. A quick, albeit gruesome, death."""

"Yeah, there was also a law enacted in the early 1600's which was based on a legal rule that originally applied to livestock/domestic animals. Basically, this law stated that any children born within the colony would take on the social status of the mother- and at the time this ruling was a complete reversal of common law practice in England (which said that all children would take the status of the father). The reason why this law came into being was so that any child born to an enslaved mother would also be a slave, regardless if the father was freeborn or Christian. This law also freed any of the men (mostly white slave owners) from the legal responsibility of acknowledging or financially supporting their mixed-race children, plus they had the bonus of being able to 'get more slaves' from a single enslaved woman. It was pretty fucked up."

I finally got a rascally old woman on the phone who said she'd take all of them.  I asked what she was going to do with them, not that it was my business, and she said, ""I'm making green oil, and I need storage.  Maybe you don't want to know what green oil is.""

I told her I could take a guess, and she cackled.  I gave her directions, which seemed to be hard for her. 

Come the time I don't trust her to find the place, so I walk out on the curb with the crate and after awhile I notice an old car, 30+ years, turning into random side streets and coming out again.  I waved, and it headed in my direction.  Out popped the most classic old hippie I have ever seen, right down to the waist-length gray and granny dress.

"Agenda driven =/= Propaganda. 

Being agenda driven means you cover stories that are relevant to your beliefs, or you portray a story in a way that supports your beliefs. Every news outlet does this to some extent. 

Propaganda is intentionally fabricating most or all of the information in a story. 

Lets say CNN is doing a piece on Obama who recently made a decision that a lot of people supported, and a lot of people did not support:

* Agenda: ""President Obama's historic decision met with popular support among the public.

* Propaganda: President Obama's decision unanimously praised by every single American.""* "

When I saw they were all gone I stood in front of the tv while he was playing Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit and just flipped shit.

"On the other hand, I use this a lot to say things that someone might view as offensive but that I don't intend as offensive, and usually that I intend as a compliment. For example, if someone was angry that someone said they think slow, I might say ""No offense, but you do think slow. You take a lot of time to get things done. When you *do* get things done, though, they're always flawless because you've taken the time to think through any issues that might come up. Some people think fast and some people think deep, you think deep. Slow doesn't mean stupid."" 

Sure, they could just take what I said as agreement with the idea they're slow, because that's what it is. If they're truly dead set on the idea that they don't think slow and the idea that deep thinking is better does not sway them in this regard, then the statement *is* offensive. At the same time, I consider it a compliment because fast and shallow thinking is not as important as slow and deep thinking in my opinion. (Granted, fast and deep thinking is best, but few people can do that.) There are some things that are *truly* potentially offensive but also *truly* not meant that way at all, which is the perfect time for ""No offense, but..."" which should be immediately followed by a good explanation for why it should not be taken offensively.

But yeah, most people just use it to get away with saying whatever they want."

"Well, that, but in my experience, abusive people are addicts. They feel compelled to unleash. Presumably, for abusive parents, doing so to one child allows them just enough release to not abuse all their children. If that child for any reason isn't around, they'll move on to another child. I imagine it has the added benefit of nobody really believing the one child when their siblings seem fine.

It's a pretty compelling reason that David Peltzer's siblings say their mother didn't abuse him, they just didn't experience the abuse themselves, they didn't witness the worst of it and because he was singled out, they would have naturally assumed he done something to deserve it. As for the abuse they did witness, they believed that by being complicit in it, they would never be the target of it and admitting you helped your mother abuse your brothers has got to be a pretty hard thing to own up to, particularly if you feel your life may be turned upside down by admitting it.

Alternatively, you can look at Gertrude Baniszewski and how her abuse escalated and she convinced an entire neighbourhood of children that Sylvia Likens deserved it. By abusing one girl, she gained control over the local kids in this kind of horrific fantasy world when realistically, she had very little control over anything in the real world.

"Remember you are paying them. They provide a service only if you decide to buy it. Sometimes it will feel like you don't have options because that's a fucking great sales tactic. You always have options.

High car service, do your research, see if you can figure out the problem or at least sound somewhat educated when you get in the shop. If you can't pinpoint it don't tell them to fix it, tell them to diagnose it. When you get the diagnosis ask them how much the parts and repair will cost. Then do more research, tell them you are going to see if you can get it used and call other shops and watch the price drop before you even hang up the phone. 

With property management you NEED to read up on tenants rights in your area. I live in a college town and I have honestly heard hundreds of stories of landlords blatantly breaking the law and extorting people who don't know their rights. It's not worth their time to fight an educated person because there are so many who will just bend over because they consider a ""landlord"" an authority figure. You pay them, you are a customer you have rights, learn them and use them.

TL;DR Do research, stand your ground, let them move on to someone else to take advantage of."

"I can see a similar situation playing out between my wife and I, but the way she would handle it is one of the reasons I think she's so great.  She'd be very appreciative of everything else that I did, but would calmly say something along the lines of 

""Silverfireprime, I really appreciate what you did for me. Dinner was great, and the clean sheets are comfortable.  But next time, can you please put a priority on the dishes?  A sink full of dirty dishes bothers me more than an extra load of laundry.  I probably sound terrible for saying this, but it was just bugging me a little bit, that's all.""

It may come across in type as a little passive aggressive, but in person, it's not. When you look at her body language and tone you can see she really appreciates what I did, and she's giving reasons why she would want the dishes finished over the extra load of laundry.

"I had paid the doll maker handsomely. And then I killed him too, but I'm sure I must have felt remorseful afterwards. 
He had not asked any questions why I wanted the right eye cavity larger and not filled in with a glass eye, but I'm sure 30,000 dollars had aleviated any questions he might have had. But still he had to die. If they found her and he would have been watching the news, it would have been a matter of days before he made the connection. 
But here it was. It was perfect. 

I had put off replacing her eye until I could test it with the doll maker's eye. I needed to make sure it would squeeze in without damaging the doll or bursting. It worked perfectly. The man had understood his craft well. Would he feel the same arousal knowing a part of his body was inside his greatest work, even for a moment? I felt the urge come on but forced myself to wait. It was going to be better if I waited. The newsman said her name again today. Celeste. 

I had cast the eye in a thin resin shell. It would keep indefinitely if left undisturbed. Placing it inside the socket in the doll was simply a matter of holding the socket open with two teaspoons while I gently dropped it in. Removing the spoons was the hard part but it went off without a hitch. 

I can see her looking out at me from that blue eye, screaming silently as she is helpless to react. I invade her over and over tonight. I come screaming her name. It is the single most intense moment of my life. 

The doll screams in my sleep, I keep finding the cupboard I keep her in open in the morning. Am I taking her out at night when I see her in my dreams? The newsman says they have stopped looking for her. Her eye is slowly deteriorating, no smell luckily. 

I have found my urges unfulfilled by Celeste lately. I have decided to sell her at auction, it is a fundraiser for her search effort. It is fitting, this will satisfy me one last time. Then I need to kill again.

Then, she started to bring the backpack empty, but with a cardboard lining to make it look full. From then on, she'd arrive with it empty and leave with it filled with groceries straight from the main kitchen, including things like entire gallons of milk or blocks of cheese.

"I attended a call on a bus where ""a native man on drugs had started shaking, moaning, sweating and falling out of his seat"".   When we arrived it was clear he wasn't on drugs but a diabetic.  We treated appropriately and brought him back up.  He was pretty shaken up and we took him to the hoapital since it was the first time he had ever gone into hypoglycemic shock.  

The guy's wife had just had a baby and his father was very ill and he hadn't been eating or sleeping well - so he had taken too much insulin by mistake.  My brother is a diabetic and I had stories of him from when we were kids so we talked all the way to the hospital and during the hour wait in ER.  I finished the call and moved on to the next thinking I had actually made a really positive difference for the guy.  

Well over a year later I had to take my car into the shop for new brakes and alignment.  When I went to pick it up the guy at the front told me the job had been done complimentary by the owner - the diabetic man from the bus.

Certainly not the most dramatic call I have done, and the special treatment is completely unnecessary, but the validation of knowing we had that mutual connection during his personal emergency is something I won't forget."

"Normally, your heart beats in a nice, predictable, steady rhythm. Atria contract, atria relax while ventricles contract, ventricles relax. Repeat. We can read that rhythm by taking an EKG, tracing the electrical impulses as they move across the heart in the nice, predictable pattern of contractions and relaxations.

Sometimes, you look at your EKG, and everything has just gone to shit. ""Ah, fuck,"" you say to yourself, ""This heart is having a bad day.""

When we give a shock, we're actually trying to stop the heart. From there, either the compressions we're giving can be more effective, because we're no longer working against a dysfunctional heart, or (rarely, but ideally) the heart restarts itself into a normal rhythm.

A shockable rhythm is one that can be stopped, and where stopping would be helpful. An example is ""ventricle fibrillation."" Your rhythm strip has gone from a nice, predictable up down to looking like someone with Parkinson's is trying to draw a straight line during an earthquake. Your heart is essentially quivering like jello. We shock it, it stops quivering. Then we give you compressions and a bunch of medications and try to trick your heart into deciding to beat responsibly again.

A non-shockable rhythm would be something like asystole: a stopped heart. You've flatlined. We're not going to shock you, because your heart is already stopped. No point in stopping it again.

There are other examples in each category, but the basic formula is this: look at the heart rhythm tracing from an EKG. Would stopping the heart help? If yes, shock."

What happened ON Valentine's Day? Was he back in school? Did anyone get that poor child a card?
"i know a guy who grew up without the presence of his mom and dad, only with very old grandparents and always disappearing hippie for an aunt. he grew up quite poor for the first stages of his life, was very lonely as a child, but a wide-eyed good looking boy with artistic talents and a brilliant mind (at 8 yrs old knew all about renaissance art, how radios worked and about IBM and even chemical food ingredients, just random things really--from reading a LOT to keep the loneliness away). then he decided to make friends with ""baggage boys"" --street orphans and saw how much fun they had, realized that he wanted to become a baggage boy, too. 


time passed and the baggage boys either moved on or died (they die young in my country). life become better for him when his mom started earning money and sending it to him from working abroad) he went on to become very good in class without trying too hard, went into sports, caught the attention of a lot of girls (got a LOT of love letters) and even managed to go to the top university of my country. but alongside of this he was doing and dealing drugs. while in the university, he ""ran"" away, basically chose to become homeless  rather than be with people who didn't really care for him and never understood him. while homeless, he found another band of orphans that took him in without hesitation, gave him food even when food was scarce--which is always. (unlike in progressive countries, our government DOES NOT give away food and temporary shelter to homeless people) he lived with them for a while before he moved on. 

years later, he went to rehab, went to school again and got married.


he always tells me that sometimes, the ""rats"" that society perceives are actually the ones who are the kindest people on earth. 



Edit: 

Sorry for my bad English. 

I'd like to add that he wasn't also just adopted by a band of orphans, he got adopted a lot by different kinds of folks, namely (but not in order):

1) A family of artistic elites in the country, also elite by financial standards. They were rich but truly kind people, and they sincerely wanted to adopt him. But he had to leave. The mom got depressed for years.

2) Multiple groups of university students at different times.

3) The brother of the head of the NPA at that time (NPA stands for National People's Army, the armed wing of the communist party in our country, AKA guerrilla fighters against the government)

4) Another family of rich folks. Nice ones, too.

5) I'm sure there's more but I forgot, sorry. &gt;.&gt;


He had to leave all of them to find what he was trying to look for. I think he found it in that band of brothers he got from the streets and he says they will forever be in his heart, wherever they are. I think he extended them into mine. :)  I can never look at street ""hobos"" the same way ever again.

"I think they mean that if you're in a far north/south latitude the sun will move from east to west across one half of the sky. If you're outside the tropics then the sun is never directly overhead. In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun transits the southern half of the sky, and the further north you are the closer to the horizon it moves. This is why solar panels tend to be installed facing south when you live in the Northern Hemisphere. The reverse is true in the Southern Hemisphere. Likewise, this is where the old wilderness survival navigation advice of ""there's always more moss on the north face of a tree"" comes from, as the north side of trees (assuming you're in the northern hemisphere, and the tree you're looking at has branches that start high enough that sunlight reaches the lower portion of the trunk) will *generally* stay slightly cooler and more damp, while the southern face will get more sunlight and dry out and be less ideal for moss."

"Telling people with a depression to go do something about it. 

I've struggled with depression for ages. Of course people telling you to just ""be happy""  don't help. But you need to get off your damn ass, seek help. Go do things,  exercise and socialize. Especially on places like reddit people indulge in just complaining and soaking up attention from how bad their life is. Even in this thread it's going on. I did it too. 

The truth is. Nobody doing ANYTHING is going to cure your damn depression except you. And complaining about others not understanding you sure as hell won't fix it. "
"I could never convince myself to save Chloe. I know the Bae over Bay is by far the most vocal fandom  (Though from what I see saving Bay is slightly the bigger choice) but the way I see it it is the wrong choice.

However at the end she changes. She starts caring for others. She shows concern for her mother and even step father. She goes from only Caring about herself to willing to sacrifice herself to save others. It is huge character development and it's something that I can't take away from her by saving her. To me that feels like the theme I can relate to. That the good of others sometimes has to come before the individual and that sometimes it has to hurt a lot. "

"Similar to what my dad's last straw was. 

He got into a bad accident, completely shattered his foot and ankle and had to have surgery. My mom was too drunk to come to the hospital as soon as she heard. Had her dad go instead. 

Then when he found out he needed surgery he called her and asked her to please come, because he was terrified. She acted like a teenager who got told to clean their room. ""UGH FINE."" was her last line then she hung up. She didn't say a word to him at the hospital. 

My siblings were really upset and scared, and she kept snapping at them to shut up. (They were both under 10 at the time). Then we finally went up to see him, and were only allowed about 10 minutes before she got impatient with our sadness and because she wanted to go grocery shopping. 

Then while he recovered she refused to help him do anything. He was supposed to sit and rest for 2 weeks minimum. She made him make his own food, bathe himself, go grocery shopping  (I drove). It was awful.

Edit: She also got annoyed with him on Christmas, because the accident was the 22nd and he was on a lot of meds so pretty out of it. She tried to withhold them so he'd be more coherent. Plus she got mad that everyone was fretting over him, making sure he was comfortable and getting everything he needed. 

She also bitched at him for wincing or struggling from being in pain. He was supposed to be on pain meds longer but she took his refill. Plus wouldn't let him keep smoking or sleep in their bed. He was literally confined to the couch for over a month, couldn't drive, didn't have anyone to talk to, and couldn't even smoke or do anything but watch TV . 

I had to go back to school, otherwise I would have been taking care of him. It was an awful time. But he's so much happier without her, and she's learning to be happy."

Yes, going hard feels amazing sometimes, but so does slow teasing of the clit with your tongue, so does some skillful fingering of the g-spot, so does going nice and slow and deep and feeling the entire length of your cock slide in and out. 

Sometimes gagging and being rough is hot during a blowjob, but sometimes we want to tease you for a while, slowly lick up the shaft, play with your balls, and make it more personal than face fucking."

They probably assumed that by giving the guy gift cards he would end up coming more times than he had to and making the company some money. Instead, he didn't end up coming any more than he would have normally, and the company lost a lot of money on the guy. "
"I've been on websites before that have done that and I've been majorly impressed. So there is some kind of software out there.

The issue would lie in that fact that the CV/resume isn't a standard document - everyone's is different in their own little ways, and that could screw with trying to get the information out accurately on a constant basis. I'm guessing it comes down to whether the company feels it's worth the time/effort/cost/dinosaurs implementing it on their website when half the people will have to edit the information it pulls out the CV/resume anyway."

"Shiit similar thing happened at my elementary school. Between me and my 2 friends we were in on it early. I had a holo Zapdos, my buddies had Blastoise and Venusaur. We dominated every kid who came to play us, but we never played for cards, just bragging rights. Inevitably my friendo convinces a kid to play for keeps and smokes him, gets like half his deck including a holo Alakazam I think. Principal and our teacher (who hated me and the guys in my class) banned the cards and made us give some of our decks to him. We said no, these are ours we paid/won them fair and square. They said everyone should have equal cards. But this happened after school we said. Didn't matter.  We got in school suspensions for bullying and my dad wouldn't let me get anymore cards."

"For me, it's the exact opposite. People assume I'm super outgoing, extroverted, and unafraid of the spotlight when in fact I'm generally very shy, introverted and extremely afraid of the spotlight and attention. I think the fact that I'm very comfortable around friends and family make people assume I'm the same way all the time, but it's not black and white -- I can be very fun, funny, outgoing and jovial as long as the environment calls for it, but that does not mean I'm that way all the time. It's hard because I constantly hear ""what's wrong?"" if I'm not talking, telling some kind of story, or being extroverted. "

"This. Also, our gym teacher was an old lesbian who always, ALWAYS walked through the girls locker room when we were changing. Never the boys, ALWAYS the girls. So that didn't help either. And no one wanted to get naked in front of their classmates. I remember changing for gym class during high school was a very awkward experience of trying to keep every girl in the room from seeing any part of my body. 

Whereas now I really enjoy going to the sauna and have no issue with nudity AT ALL anymore.

EDIT: the woman just happened to be a lesbian, doesn't really add to the story though. Sorry if it came across as that. She ogled and stuck around, and kept encouraging us to use the showers. It just had a very pervy feel to it."

"Based on the class in IP Law I took two years ago, patent trolls are not all bad for innovation. Suppose you are a mom-n-pop inventor and you invent the next big thing.  You patent it and its approved yadda yadda. It's let's say a new phone antenna. Now Apple and Verizon and Samsung and whatever are going to want to use it. Well you say ""I want $50 million,"" and they say ""We'll pay $1.99."" So you tell them to fuck off and you'll sell to their competitor. Well all the big cell phone companies go and try to pay jack for it. So you tell them that it will just sit in your garage and no one will have better antennae for the next 20 years (because that's how long patents last).

So now, what happens? These companies are big and want your stuff. So they ignore your patent and use it anyway. (This is hypothetical. I'm not accusing any particular company of anything. I just like concrete examples.) Since part of the patent process is publishing your work, it should be easy to replicate. So now the next iPhone comes out with your antenna in it. You realize this, you see that its easy to prove, and so you go to court. But you hire a cheap lawyer, and Apple uses its general council (already on payroll, so pretty cheap for them). You probably lose. O.K. Well what if you pay for a better lawyer so you win? With what money? No one bought your brilliant invention and your a mom-n-pop garage inventor. So you go into massive debt. Apple is just going to delay the trial until you agree to settle. So sure you now get $1m instead of $1.99, but you don't get your $5om either. And most of that $1m is going to your lawyer anyway. 

Enter the patent troll. Patent troll companies are basically just lawyers who are law-suit happy right? Well guess who is really good at suing companies for patent infringement and making a general nuisance of themselves? And look at what service you want as an inventor! Go to a patent troll and use them rather than a regular lawyer. They have experience and they'll have a legitimate chance of winning a case this time. 

Isn't a company ignoring patent law illegal? Yes. Why would they do it even the face of triple damages if found guilty of infringement? Because in most cases they aren't caught or the plaintiff settles because they can't afford lawyers. In brief, because it is cheaper! Patent trolls help inventors stop big companies from screwing them over.

At some level patent trolls encourage mom-n-pop style inventors by hurting large companies. Are they always a source for good? No. But they certainly do something useful for innovation. 

I apologize if any of the above information is inaccurate. It is, to the best of my knowledge accurate, and if not, explains the general gist of the story, if not the precisely true facts."

I can think of a million things the teacher could have done but she just sat there impatiently staring at him, eyebrows raised. Probably 10 silent minutes passed (and if you're introverted this feels like hours of complete agony) of him shaking and looking terrified before she told him to sit down. 

So few teachers know how to work with shy, introverted personalities. You can't shame an introvert into becoming more extroverted by shoving them into situations that create nothing but panic and anxiety "

"Computer science undergrad here:


Whenever I hear people talking about ""AI becoming super smart"" or ""sentient"" it makes me bash my head off the table over and over and over again. Googles alpha-go uses neural networks, the way neural networks work is it has a layer of input nodes, a hidden layer, and a layer of output nodes, the hidden layer can be huge, however the larger the hidden layer the longer the time it takes to learn.


Say we want to train an AI on cat recognition, we give it a picture of a cat, it propagates though the hidden layer and gives an output, the output is compared to what is sent in and an error is calculated. This is then back-propagated though the neural network adjusting the weights of the network to produced something closer to what was inputted, this process can take hours, and the larger the network the longer it takes. 


The neurons effected during training are the neurons that's purpose is to react when a certain pattern is given, so if a similar pattern is given then it would find it difficult to differentiate between the two. 


Neural networks are structures, not sentient things, structures that takes ages to train (change), there is no way now, or ever, that they will become ""smart"". If we try to use them for general purpose tasks like [creating a movie](http://arstechnica.co.uk/the-multiverse/2016/06/sunspring-movie-watch-written-by-ai-details-interview/) they fail horribly because some of the learning they do is overwritten with other learning. 


Stop with the ""AI will become smart"" when there is *nothing* so far that suggests it's even possible. 


Could we increase the size of the neural network such that its large enough that it becomes less likely that one training will not interfere with another? Sure, but then what is the point? The training time would become so long with no guarantee that it would even work that it's not worth doing. It's like me saying ""I can move a bottle from point A to point B fast using my hands, therefor I can build a rocket ship just as fast using my hands"" No... it doesn't scale that way, there might be better things out there that you can use to make a rocket ship faster. But we haven't discovered them yet and there is no indication that they actually exist. 


Unless you want to give an example of some AI thing that actually has a good structure that works on any tasks without fail...

edit: Maybe I shouldn't have said they would never be good at general tasks, as /u/Pterocraptyl pointed out, a combination of technologies might result in an AI that can do general tasks better than humans, what I meant was there is no indication that there is going to be an AI that has superintelligence that can do every task perfectly."

"I got the epidural, it didn't work, it had negative effects on my child when she was born (shouldn't have, but somehow it got to her), I blew up like a balloon from the IV they pump into you, I was uncomfortable but wasn't allowed to move/walk around despite the epidural not working anyways, I was starving but not allowed to eat, and my back hurts still if I'm hunched over for more than a few seconds (like when I'm changing her diaper, go to stand up and instant back pain)....


Yeah, I'm going without the epidural next time, I know I can handle it, and for me it wasn't worth the issues. I know some people have great experiences with it, I just wasn't one of them, and I never want to go through that again. On one hand, having 100% feeling of the birth process was incredible. On the other hand, the hours of labour leading up to birth sucked haha."

"Be college age and on the road at 4 am. They like looking for kids driving to school at the beginning and end of breaks hoping they can get some fines and arrests. The reason for stopping me changed several times, but there was apparently an ""overwhelming odor of burnt marijuana"" in the car giving them cause to search and find a gram and grinder in my bag. They lied about my ability to perform the roadside sobriety tests on the report and because piss tests only say you smoked at some point in the past thirty days it was enough for them to claim I was intoxicated while driving. My lawyer recommended I plead guilty rather than risk a harsher sentence if I fought it and lost, which was likely because without proof it becomes my word against theirs and they're a cop. I'm just a delinquent with pot in the car, why wouldn't I be stoned too. Plus if they were willing to fudge my sobriety tests then what else would they be willing to do.

Really shattered my faith in the justice system. Seemed a lot less focused on my wellbeing and rehabilitation and getting at the truth and a lot more focused on making me feel like a scumbag and bleeding me dry with fines on fines because it's easier to lie to a judge with a guilty plea than fight for my innocence when no one is prepared to believe me."

"Here's the thing. You said ""SEALs are Special Forces.""

Can they fall under the same command? Yes. No one's arguing that, you little bitch.

As someone who has over 300 confirmed kills, I am telling you, specifically, in the military, no one calls SEALs SF. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""Special Operations"" you're referring to the United States Special Operations Command, which includes things from Army Rangers to my secret network of spies across the USA.

So your reasoning for calling a SEAL SF is because random people ""call the gorilla ones SF?"" Let's get SOW and MRR in there, then, too. 

Also, calling someone DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six? It's not one or the other, that's not how Special Operations Command works. They're both. A SEAL is a SEAL and a member of USSOCOM. But that's not what you said. You said a SEAL is SF, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all operators of the USSOCOM family SF, which means you'd call Rangers, Pararescuemen, and other operators SF, too. Which you said you don't.

"A-fucking-men. My mom has a gay best friend, so she uses him as her ""I'm not homophobic"" token.

I'm into women, and she says really specific, horrible shit to me about my sexuality. But nope, not homophobic at all, she's got a Gay Friend.

Not exactly the same thing, but I understand. It comes from a blanket prejudice while specific non-white, non-straight, non-whatever people are okay.

"Damn, all these kids bringing guns and drugs to school and molesting each other. I was suspended like 5 times but they were for awesome reasons;

1. I put my Social Studies teacher's stuffed Pink Panther doll in the corner of the classroom on a chair facing the wall, then tucked its tail between it's legs and taped the hands around it. She didn't find it until 2 classes later, when she comes storming into my math class demanding to speak with me. Got like a week for that.

2. We made these wire sculptures in art class, I made a little dude with long tentacley arms, and in the next period, I was trying to freak people out by sticking it's ""hands"" in a socket (all the wires used were insulated, including the ends I was sticking into the socket.) Teacher flipped out, thought I was trying to off myself, I played it up, got like 4 days off from school.
3. Got in a fight with another kid on the football team. I dunno i was trying to assert dominance or something, he and I got along, had no beef, but there were others instigating, so i was goaded into it. I threw his jacket in the dirt or something, and then it was on. The fight consisted of a large group of people gathered in a circle yelling, and me and this other dude just standing there trying to figure out what to do. One of my cohorts grabs my hand and slaps this kid in the face with it, so he goes completely Bobby Boucher and tackles me to the ground slapping me in the head. I totally deserved it. They suspended me and some other kid who had nothing to do with it, but not the guy I was fighting or my pal who had swung my first swing for me. the other kid who got suspended was pretty beat up about it, and his parents freaked out, so I think his sentence was shortened. I was like ""hey three free days to read star wars books"". Best part about the this one was that the Principal told me I had to tell my mom myself, so instead of saying a word about the suspension, I tried to fake sick. She didn't buy it, so the next morning I just went to the bus stop as normal, which was near this drainage ditch, and just hung out in the ditch all day playing Pokemon Yellow and reading. Around noon or so, my mom comes to the bus stop and starts screaming for me. I sheepishly come out of the ditch and she smacks me right then and there. I guess after she'd gotten to work, she felt bad about me being ""sick"" and going to school, so she came to the school to check me out early. The office was like ""Ummm...well here's the thing."" And she thought i'd been kidnapped. She knew my friend and I liked to play in that ditch so that was the first place she looked. 
4. I had this really annoying friend who's family was loaded, and they always let him order weird shit out of the backs of magazines and comics. One time he bought this prank kit, which contained all kinds of random shit. he said i could have one thing, so i picked ""Stinky String"" which was like silly string but it smelled like skunk buttholes and burnt hair. I thought it'd be a super great idea to spray it on my other friend as his bus was leaving. The driver stopped in the middle of the street, and came running out yelling at us about vandalism, then the smell hit her and the few kids i'd hit through the window. i think one girl started throwing up and crying. That was like a whole week's worth.
5. From the same ""prank kit"" or whatever, there was some of that ""smoke from fingertips"" stuff, which i guess is actually just like super diluted rubber cement. You put it between your fingers and pull them apart and the little wisps of adhesive would float up and look like smoke. This stuff was also super sticky and you had to wipe off your hands every once in a while or it wouldn't work right. we were showing it off on the bus, and just wiping our hands on the back of the seat, like savages. Bus driver saw, thought we were actually smoking, then came back and saw that in reality we were just ruining the seats. 2 days suspension.

Ah to be 11 again.

I became so enraged and bitter over her breaking up with me and seeing other people that I always tried to scoop up dirt on the poor girl. One day I struck gold. She was in a club that had a field trip where they stayed in a hotel for a weekend. As horny teenagers do, she invited one of her crushes over at night. Well I found out things got a little heated, to the point where the guy slid his hands down her pants and fingered her. But when he entered her he felt something similar to the consistency of cottage cheese. So she basically had a yeast infection that she didn't know about and decided to get frisky with her crush. After he felt that he just got up and walked out. The guy turned out to be a real scum bag, because he decided to tell me, the crazy ex. As a crazy obsessive ex does, I then proceeded to tell everyone that hated her, all of which I gave explicit instructions to spread the rumor throughout the whole school. Before the end of the day, my whole class 890 juniors knew of her encounter, and I ruined the rest of her high school career. I know this makes me a complete scumbag, but it worked in my favor at the time because now every guy found her repulsive, and she came running back to me within the year.

"&gt; The biggest reason for mocking the dumbasses who think they're... genderqueer

Out of curiosity (and trying not to be rude despite your condescension), why don't you think it's ""legitimate"" for people to not identify with either gender in the binary?

I'm a straight guy, but I think it's crazy rude to pretend you're the arbiter of personal identity when someone's minding their own damn business.

It's one thing when we're talking about people trying super hard to be a special butterfly and belong to their ""unique"" communities, but I consider genderqueer to be a perfectly valid self-identification. It represents less an actual physiological issue (wrong genitalia) and more a dismissal of prescribed social expectations based on genitalia.

To keep her in a steady cycle of drinking and taking prescriptions meds while laying about the house doing nothing all day, she had to keep upping her game about the kinds of lies she would tell me.  The last and strangely also the most easy to verify story was the one that did it; she lied about being held up at gun point so that I'd let her wallow in self pity and stop harping on about how much booze she was drinking per day.  Once I found out the truth, that was the moment I knew my instincts were right all along.

"She was messy and a slob. I was clean but was pacifist enough to tolerate it with the occasional fight to try to change it. I'd cleaned the house up a couple of times completely (took 18+ hours over the course of a weekend while she was out of town with the kids).

I'd made some mistakes early on in our marriage and almost cheated. I didn't but it haunted me forever. Fast forward 8 years. I'm saving up money on the side because we can never save any money (did I mention she was bad with money too?). I got a raise at work and had put $100 a paycheck away. Not much, but enough to hopefully have money to do bigger things with our house. I didn't tell her because if I did...she'd start asking for it.

Long story short she got a hold of a pay stub and saw it. Accused me of saving up to leave. Couple that with all the other issues and the constant neglect of our house she told me to leave and I left. It's hard on the kids and I but it's better for me. I'm a better dad because I'm not constantly being passive aggressive that the house isn't clean or she's wasting time on things and not doing what she should be.

"I think the problem is that it's often discussed in such broad terms. Worse, is how often it degrades into a contest of ""who has it worse"". It's not a contest. Women face issues due to sexism, and men also face issues due to sexism. Both deserve to be discussed openly. The existence of one problem doesn't negate the other.

I have personally experienced pay inequality due to sexism. At my last job I started at the same time as a male coworker. I came with more experience and more education. I taught him a very large portion of the job. We were hired into parallel positions doing the same thing. When I quit I found out that I was making 60% of what he was despite being far more qualified. Does that mean that the wage gap is a universal thing? Not at all. It means that in this particular job I experienced pay inequality. It also doesn't mean that you haven't experienced the opposite. I believe you. Just because I have been underpaid as a woman doesn't mean that others aren't sometimes overpaid for being a woman.

On the other side, a good male friend of mine is going through heartbreak because the woman he loves doesn't trust him with her child just because he's a man. On a larger scale, male victims of statutory rape are often not taken seriously. These are all very real problems that desperately need attention.

It's hard to say ""Here's how to help as an average person."" I'm still trying to figure that out myself. I think one step is simply listening to others. I'm a big fan of /r/menslib. It helps me to better understand what men are facing so I can try to be a better advocate."

"Amen. The whole Valentine's video really showed how the fandom is more obsessed with their perception of how these two people SHOULD be instead of who they actually ARE. (I once inadvertently found it on PornHub, if that isn't just the worst.) Interestingly, though, I feel like Dan and Phil are kind of phasing out. The decision to write the book and the tour feels very farewell-ish to me, and in Dan's most recent video (about exams) the way he talks about school and YouTube gave me the impression that he's kind of ready to do something else but feels trapped.

I hope they're able to make the radio thing a bigger career, or something, because regardless of how they feel, they're not going to be young and cute very much longer."
"The ""separateness"" you mentioned is kind of right... but also kind of off.

Catholics believe they can talk directly to God as well. God is omnipotent. They don't need a priest or really anyone to intervene.

The sacrament of confession is directly linked to that: confession. As much as we can pray and confess our wrongdoings to an invisible God, there is something very different about going to a flesh and blood person, knowing that you are opening up to them of your own free will, opening yourself up to judgement - not just from ""God"" but from man. And then it's also knowing that it's solely a personal confession, knowing that the priest will not tell another living soul, that it's up to you to keep moving forward or to back away depending on the magnitude of your crimes. Confession is more about owning up to your own mistakes and a feeling that you can be more, that you can be *better* than what you currently are.

Which I guess ties straight back into the whole being level-headed thing. A lot of Catholicism (at least modern Catholicism) deals with self-reflection. Granted, we're still tied up in internal dogma wars out the wazoo (especially in the US), but we tend to write a lot elegant papers towards each other about them."

"Gay people.

Everytime I visit other cities I feel happy that I see gay couples out and about but my city is a constant reminder that we aren't well liked and it'll probably keep being so. So that, I wish people would let us live our lives like the rest and for my local community to start being more fearless."

"&gt; Coming from having sex a couple times a week in the past - even the distant past - to having sex once every 5-8 weeks is... well, it's different.

This was referring to your current relationship, no? If so, it's unfair for her to change with no real explanation. The truth is that once every 6-8 weeks is extremely infrequent for anyone, especially young people.  You deserve to know why it changed, and you can lead off saying that you don't think it's normal (obviously, phrasing is key here so say it nicer than that - something may have happened that you don't know about).  

If I was wrong and that referred to a past relationship compared to your present one (i.e., she's always had this level of sex drive) it's unfair of you to expect her to change.  You can try and talk to her about it, but you can't expect her to change.  Having incompatible sex drives is a huge relationship issue, even if one partner doesn't see it that way. If you can't work it out it's best for both of you to split. "

Got absolutely trashed by critics, resulted in it losing millions of dollars because apparently everyone goes off of Rotten Tomatoes like 30% ratings.

"Too Human was a guilty pleasure for me. It's a game I know is not objectively a well made game, but I felt it had it's heart in the right place, and the moment to moment gameplay was fun. And it was a co-op loot game, and at some level, those are always going to be inherently fun at some level. Unfortunately the game falls apart by being a loot game with little loot diversification, no endgame, a scaled back 2 player (from 4 player) coop, and balance issues where you can easily break the game (though I have less of an issue with that than most in ARPG games).

Too Human just felt like it fell into the classic Silicon Knights' issue where their reach exceeded their grasp. Just looking at it, I can respect what they were going for. They wanted a more action oriented Diablo type, co-op focused game on a console. Keep in mind this game came out **4 years** before Diablo 3 did. Obviously the original Diablo games, along with other old school ARPGs existed, but the whole ARPG, and ""ARPG-fication"" of other genres really didn't take off in the mainstream until after D3. SK in a sense were actually ahead of the curve in that aspect. But then  they tried to make a game that really demands a huge studio with hundreds of employees and a huge budget to pull off, when SK is really at it's core, a smaller, grassroots type of studio."

"this was in maybe 2012? 2013? my sister was around 13, and she'd won a meet&amp;greet through some contest. because when he originally announced his tour, Finland wasn't on it, my mom agreed to take her to Sweden for the concert. this seems excessive, but you have to understand, her room was basically a shrine. it was completely wallpapered in pictures of him, she knew every little detail about him, it was a little bit creepy. she could tell you how big he was when he was born.

anyway, so she wins this M&amp;G, and it's for her and a friend. so she takes a friend with her, but this friend isn't as big a fan as she is (this will be important later).

so they spend a fun day in Stockholm, and head over to the arena in time for when the M&amp;G was advertised to start. no sign of the Biebs. he eventually shows up like three hours later.

there was another girl and her friend who'd also won the M&amp;G, and all four of them are shoved into the room with Bieber at the same time (literally shoved by the security guards). he doesn't look at them, he doesn't smile, he doesn't even say hello. the guards shove them into formation with him, placing my sister's friend next to Bieber and my sister on the end, so she's not even touching him. they snap a few pictures, and shove all the girls away again. Bieber walks away without a word.

my mom was at the concert with her (the concert was after the M&amp;G), and said my sister was basically catatonic for the entire thing."

She sounds like my girlfriend was. I met her because she was a singer for the band at my high school this year (I graduated last year) and she could always find a positive side to everything. I felt so lucky to have found someone so nice and loving (even though I'm pretty cynical at times as well) and we were both extremely happy. She suddenly passed away from double pneumonia (misdiagnosed as strep throat) just over 3 months ago. I'm still having trouble with it some days but overall I'm just glad I got to meet and know her.

"Hi, 
I had to create an account to answer this (first post)

So my dad recently was arrested for drink driving.
To cut a long story short he was basically followed by the police car with the sirens and lights on for a distance over a kilometer.
He just drove home from where the cops put the sirens on as if nothing was happening.
I was sitting in my car on my street and all I remember is watching my dad turn onto my street and a police car following him. He pulls into the driveway and stays seated in his car.
Two officers run as fast as they can up the drive and arrest him in his vehicle. 

In the report they said he was evading police but because he wasn't recklessly driving he was not further punished.

It was eventful.
Hope this give some insight to your question."

Also watching feeling her move her hips too the rhythm of my tongue and fingers .and her fingers in my hair and the noises she makes is a great turn on obviously.

"The Sun is about 400 times larger in diameter than the moon, but is also about 400 times further away, making them both appear to be the same size in the earth's sky. This means that earth can witness a total solar eclipse, a unique trait of our solar system. So if intelligent extraterrestrial life existed and could travel to our planet, they may do so just to witness this rare celestial event. 

Also, the moon's orbit expands by about 4cm every year, so eventually total solar eclipses will no longer occur as the moon moves further away."

"A lot of people really dislike it, but I like it too.

I think it's one of those ""it is what it is"" films, where it's just rare to like it for what it is and was trying to be. It was never really supposed to make sense. It was all archetypes and tropes designed to look beautiful and, in some places, give a good tug on the heartstrings. 

The plot was barely coherent, but it wasn't really supposed to be. The rules of how Babydoll's dancing keep changing according to what's necessary for the plot at the time, but the rules in dreams don't really make sense. We never know what's real and what isn't, but does that matter?

I mean, I guess those are dealbreakers for a lot of people. I think a lot of people thought it was incoherent and I think they're right, but coherency wasn't really the aim of it, so if you can like it for what it was actually trying to be, then you're good.

This is a somewhat more unpopular addition to why I think the general public didn't like it, but here goes:

I think there are a lot of self-proclaimed feminists who beat on it without having seen it or given it a chance. It's an intensely feminist (to the point where I might actually call it offensively feminist) movie, but you're not going to see that if you're not looking for it. Because think about it: the movie was marketed as an excuse to watch hypersexualized hot girls in short skirts do ridiculous things with swords, with a main character who is *clearly* intended to look underage and sexy. That's gonna make some people hate it right out the gate.

Which brings us to my next point - it was marketed that way on purpose, and then the movie itself ended up being *about* insulting the very audience to whom it was marketed. Consider what it would be like for some dude to walk into that movie, looking at it as an excuse to watch sexy underage girls dancing in their underwear and doing flips with swords (complete with pantyshots, of course). The movie then spent the entire running time telling those same audience members: ""Hey, hey, see this creepy-ass doctor? See all those disgusting dudes at the brothel? Look how gross they are. Look! That's you, you fucking creep!""

I can't really speak on how many of the intended targets of that commentary actually got it, but I wouldn't be surprised if they reacted badly to it, you know?"
You put your experiences very elegantly. I'm so sorry though. 
Yes! This! Those people are always so damn proud of how rude and tactless they are. But they loathe people being equally honest back. They usually have huge egos - they literally think their opinion is fact. So frustrating!
"I remember an ask reddit while back where a female porn star described how common it was, when a girls cooter was *really* nasty, to force said girl to taste her own nastyness by sticking things that had been in her cooch into her mouth. (Fingers, dildos, dicks, ect.)

Everything seemed normal, we played video games until it was dinner time. They invited me to stay for dinner and after dinner I went into the kitchen to put my plate in the sink. That's when I notice the huge pile of dishes, the stove was filthy and had ROACHES crawling all over it.

One of the twins came in behind me and opened the cabinet to get a glass, there were hundreds of roaches crawling all over the door, all in the glasses, and all over the plates. Plates that looked just like the one I had just ate out of! He thought it was normal, funny, even. As he opened the door he yells ""It's ALIVE!"" I nearly barfed all over the floor.

I promptly turned around and left, didn't say a word, and never spoke to them again. I saw one of them at a gas station recently, all of his teeth were brown and yellow and just a complete mess. He works at a nearby Rally's, I no longer eat at that Rally's."

"The Eleven Symptoms of Alcohol Use Disorder

1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects.

4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol. 

5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.

6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.  

7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use.

8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.

9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol.

10.  Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a) A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect b) A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol.

11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a) The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to criteria A and B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal) b) Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

The presence of at least 2 of these symptoms indicates an alcohol use disorder (AUD). The severity of an AUD is graded mild, moderate, or severe:

Mild: The presence of 2 to 3 symptoms.Moderate: The presence of 4 to 5 symptoms.Severe: The presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Conclusion: If You Meet 2 of the 11 Criteria for AUD, Reach Out and Ask for Help

"Fuck that. The cops were literally *in the building* too with the shooter. He was pushed into the bathroom by the cops. The majority of the hostages were in the bathroom with him. He wasn't shooting them once in the bathroom and definitely wasnt just casually shooting for hours. And the cops most definitely werent ""chillin outside"". Yes they were shot but do they go busting in right away through a small bathroom door only to jeopardize the ones still alive in there with him? The remaining people in the building that were safe in other parts were sheltered in place *safe* until it was over. Its unfortunate that people were hurt in the bathroom but you can't go blazing in without knowing the details and risking their lives even more. Nevermind the fact that there was confusion about a 2nd shooter upstairs too. 

But it aggravates me when people think the cops weren't doing anything while this guy was just walking around in the building shooting people. They're taught if there's an "" active shooter"" to move to that and immediately engage him. If he was walking around shooting they would have engaged, and they did at the initial shooting."

&gt; One of our Olympic gold medalists is probably going to miss out on going to Brazil, where he is tipped to win, because he was caught with his weapon and ammunition in his car, without being properly locked up. We take it seriously, and as such, we dont have the gun crime here

you need a CAT-R license it is the hardest to obtain and you must not shoot or store ammunition with any of the weapons you have registered on that cat r license, but you can have a semi-m60 if you wanted. provided its essentially in a hermetically sealed nuclear bunker 500ft underground with a secret tunnel leading to your local police station.


its why high grade Japanese ""model guns"" are so prevalent in collectors vast mostly fake arsenal's. in WA no license required because they are in essence zinc cap guns that look and function the same. (slight differences so you cant stick in real barrels or bolts or use replica parts for a real firearm)

"The gravitational wave actually changes the length of the space in the cavity between the mirrors (rather than moving the mirrors themselves).  It is literally a ripple in space-time.  The distance between the mirrors is measured by beams of light that are split and recombined such that very small variations in the interference pattern can be detected.  The interference change that is detected is a result of the difference in distance traveled by the light beams caused by the brief ripple in space caused by the gravitational wave.

Yes the wave height is tiny.  Mind bogglingly small.  However the distance traveled by these waves is also mind boggling.  The LIGO observatories are capable of detecting gravitational waves of two inspiral solar-mass neutron stars from a distance of 8 million parsecs.  One parsec is 19 trillion miles (or 3.26 light-years).

I'm at a huge mental clash as to my opinion on the education system and its approach to critical thinking. On the one hand, everyone should be able to think critically and question everything they are told or taught. On the other hand, an entire world of people with such an ability would surely lead to anarchy. 

It's just sad that those in primary/elementary school, and even up to high school or beyond, are told ""this is fact, learn it"" and not even taught about counter-arguments or questioning facts. 

Damn, maybe I've just gone hippy but surprisingly coming from a science and military background I now think some of the education system's most important subjects are religious/social/philosophy-type studies.

"As a freshman in college, finding alcohol can be quite the struggle. One of the more legendary (and terrifying) incidents happened when I tried to steal alcohol.

I walk into the store and peruse a few aisles in an attempt to deflect suspicion, ultimately ending at the alcohol isle. I load up my basket with a 24 pack of brews and a bottle of Jameson. 

Here's where I notice something is wrong.

 I see that the store is security quickly closing in on the alcohol isle, and managers are posted at the exits. Thinking fast, I duck into the next aisle and notice that there's a clear shot to the exit. Everyone had their back turned, heading to the alcohol aisle in attempt to find the perpetrator. 

I coolly walk out the door and then sprint to my friends car in the lot. Behind me, a manager screams to come back - thankfully, the store had a strict no chase policy, so they were stuck at the doors. We peel out of the lot, thanking the stars for such luck and vowing never to pinch from stores ever again. We ditch the boxes and the basket further down the road and proceed to have a fine night.

"Having a baby can weaken your pelvic floor muscles, which are the muscles used to hold in urine. So, yes, if a woman has had children it is not uncommon for her to pee a tiny bit when she sneezes or laughs hard. It's highly embarassing, but there's not a ton you can do to stop it besides kegals and panty liners.

However, diapers are overkill for this problem. Your average woman is not wearing diapers, we just wear a very thin liner in the seat of our regular underwear [like this](http://www.homehealth-uk.com/image_01/image/use1.jpg). If someone is wearing adult diapers then they have urinary incontinence issues unrelated to being a woman.

Edit: Most people who use adult diapers are very elderly, but advertisers will often cast young people in ads for elderly health products as a way to not draw attention to the age factor. Losing bodily functions can be quite humiliating for the elderly."

He told me that one of his older cousins had learned that his best friend was of a different race and told him that we would both eventually grow apart and start hanging out with people who are more like us. Sure enough in high school that's exactly what happened, we both just kind of slowly grew apart as started hanging out with more people of the same race...there was no conflict, no real reason behind it and at the time I didn't even realize it was happening but when I think back on it I feel bad."

The HR employee asks him is anyone has every sexually harassed him, which he says they haven't.  She then says 'so you want me to fire these employees, strictly based on their sexual orientation, just so you don't feel uncormfortable?'

We (my mom and I) had just arrived and they were just coming out and mom stops to pay the bill.  We were both in middle school and I really had no interaction with him, mostly because I thought him weird.  Anyway, it's very early summer and receptionist asks the boy something akin to how he's been spending his time during the nice weather.  Mom chimes in before kid can answer and says, ""Oh, tell her about the rabbits"".  Kids starts matter of factly describing this next of baby rabbits he's found and how he used a pair of vice grips to slowly crush their heads and kill them (think adjust them just enough to fit their little heads and then slowly turn the screw).  Mom's all smiles while receptionist (and everyone else within earshot) is utterly dumbfounded.  Pretty sure serial killer ran in the family."

"Oh man, similar thing happened to me when I was 15 or so and worked at a supermarket. I was feeling a little unwell, and mentioned it to one of the customers coming through my checkout, because I liked to make small talk to pass the time. She asked if she could pray for me, and my reaction was ""What a nice gesture!"". I told her I appreciated it, and all of a sudden she slapped her hands on my shoulders, threw her head back, and started chanting for jesus to rid my body of evil spirits and demons. It was really unsettling to be honest."

Actually tackling the mental and developmental problems requires smarter thinking, help from parents and even a (major) change in society as a whole. It's too big a thing for any one law or policy change to fix. So they just ban something that has nothing to do with the problem and carry on."

"Their order had remained a secret for a millennia ,  the secrets they had found from a mysterious artifact that seemed to come from another planet had revealed to them things that the rest of the world was still not even close to being ready for.  

Deep in their shrine they trained constantly, training to defend a planet that had long since forgotten their existence against a silent threat that could jeopardize the very future of their species. 

Silently, a lone member of their order prepares himself for a recon mission,  one of hundreds that happen every day at sites just like this one from around the planet.  They routinely went out in secret to check the general population for signs of threat.  With long practiced precision, he adorns his strange flying suit and attaches the survey needle and walks down a massive hallway that makes up the very core of the device that makes their work possible.  

As he progresses down the hallway, he begins to feel his body reshaping itself into something smaller, something far more nimble than he could possibly hope to make his human body and begins to run faster and faster, until the transformation pulls his legs from the ground and he switches effortlessly to his flying device, allowing him to continue forward whilst in flight. 

As he clears the exit he orients himself as he has thousands of times before and turns toward Taipei and begins his long journey.

The mountainous terrain under his now tiny body eventually transitions to the busy streets of the massive capital city that he has sworn to help protect for decades and he begins to descend into the crowds that traveled the streets, oblivious to his presence or to the potential threat they were under. 

Effortlessly,  he swoops in and lands on the back of a young woman and uses the sampling needle to quickly acquire a minuscule portion of her blood.   Not finding what he was looking for he once more took flight and moved several blocks over and found a young man with a group of his friends,  one of them spotted him and tried to swat him out of the air but his large clumsy movement was easily avoided by the practiced movements of this silent protector.  Recovering quickly, he decides to check what appeared to be a tourist who was busy taking pictures of the street vendors.  Landing on his arm he repeated the practice of drawing blood and checking for a sample.  

He prepared to take off once again when alarms began blaring in his head.  He had found the virus that they had all been watching for for centuries and his heart began to race as it had never raced before.  The ancient enemy had returned and was beginning their attack.  

*""The headmaster must know of this, the threat must be contained! the order must be warned*"" the man thought silently as he looked over the flood of data that was coming to him from his display. 

*""I must get back there immedia....""* 

*""Fucking Mosquitoes!""* the man said after examining at the smear that remained on his hand after he had finished his uncharacteristically quick strike against the offending creature that he had found on his arm.  And with that, he turned around and continued taking pictures, oblivious to what he had just done to seal his own fate...

"Ok, here goes. This is probably going to be one of the more boring stories in the thread but it still haunts me years later as the cringiest thing I've ever done. 

I was probably around 14 years old and had been raised as a strict Muslim, wearing a headscarf, skirts, all that. We lived in a rural area and would get harassed sometimes, including by one guy who would yell ""Ragheads"" at us when he drove past. I was very sad and conflicted about it all. My siblings and I were also homeschooled in a way that made us severely socially retarded, which is possibly relevant. 

So at the time of the story my family was visiting our grandpa who lived in an even smaller town, just one traffic light, maybe 50 inhabitants, basically a very backwoods area. We had been getting more weird looks than usual on the trip and I was tense. Anyway, stuff was getting boring at my grandpa's house so my younger sister and I headed out to take a walk through the town. 

We ran into two teenage girls wearing shorts and t-shirts, which we'd been taught were very immodest. I was uncomfortable passing by the girls and didn't look at them. After we passed, my little sister said, ""Oh those girls flipped us off.""

The next morning we're all driving out to go somewhere and I see those same girls again. So I roll down my window and scream ""TRASH!"" at them at the top of my lungs. My little sister's like, ""Whoa, why did you do that?"" I said, ""Because they flipped us off!"" She's like ""Oh, no, I lied about that."" (My little sister is kind of a psychopath). 

Anyway, somewhere out there are two girls who think they got aggressively heckled by some Muslims for no reason. Sorry :("

"Well, as a polyamorous kinky chick, I get invited to orgies.  
It kinda helps to be a person who doesn't get jealous or cause drama at social gatherings involving people having sex with people.  

Most people really aren't wired to have fun at orgies.  
It involves making everyone there feel welcome and comfortable and equally wanted.  
You can't be known as the guy who hogs the hottest chick.  
And although everyone generally will respect your sexual preferences, you also need to be comfortable enough in your sexuality to be naked around a group of mixed genders and witness to these mixed genders having sexual contact in different combinations.  

For example, if two guys are getting it on next to you, it is proper etiquette to helpfully hand them the lube and condom.  It is horrible etiquette to get wigged out at two guys tucking next to you.  

So, be prepared for the reality of an orgy.  

To find one, you need to get out and be social.  Attend events, parties, etc 
Your local kink and polyamory communities are your best bets.  

Fetlife and your local polyamory meet ups are good starting points.  

Make sure you are not being creepy. 
Go here to make sure: http://dontbecreepy.com
Seriously, you have to kinda hang back and earn cred and respect.  
These are communities that watch out for each other for a reason: creeps have come in and violated us.  So we are wary.  
Seriously.  Someone was just kidnapped, she had her head shaved and was tattooed with ""property of _____"". She escaped after a few days.  Don't worry, that piece of shit is as good as dead.  

Point is, there is good reason why you have to be vetted before being invited to shit. 
It isn't because we hate you or don't want you to get laid.  
It is because we have to protect each other.  
Also it is because we wanna have drama-free fun.  
Turning shit into drama is gonna get you pretty much never invited to anything.  
Make others comfortable.  Do your best to ensure everyone is having a good time at any event you are at.  Get to know and help out the hosts at events.  

Again, most people don't want orgies.  They want monogamy.  They are jealous and they are not confident enough to be naked and fucking in a room full of people.  They don't want to fuck a girl then turn around and help someone else fuck that girl.  

However, if you are interested I guarantee there are orgies happening all over and you just have to put yourself out there.  "

"**TL;DR** Group was great until the leader made questionable choices causing the other more vulgar part to leave, causing me to migrate.





TheCreatureHub. Their older videos (Road to E3, Creature Teacher Camping, all of their old group gameplays) were awesome and I would watch them over and over(still do!) My faves were definitely Sly, Danz, and Nova (Including Aleks after he joined). 




Everyone had a nice contrast that worked, they seemed to be like a frienemy type thing. I would say Kootra(The Leader of the group) and Nova(A longtime member, the Second iirc) had the best contrasting friendship. Kootra was modest, childish, not so skilled, and clumsy. Nova was more devious, impulsive, vulgar, but yet witty. Put any combination of anyone and pair them and it would be interesting.



However, their content has been dwindling in quality and the genuine feeling is fading away. It is actually a company now. They still were great, but the concepts and creativity were vastly different as the years went on, and it just sorta went everywhere. Kootra became more giddy, annoying, and had an extreme obssession with cats out of nowhere. But there are a few that didn't change MUCH, but I will get back to that. 




You could definitely tell the creative control was shifting. As you may have guessed, Kootra began to sorta take over the creative control. Funnily enough, his contrasting fellow, Nova, simply did not agree with the strict creative control and rules(No drinking being one of them). This causes a great chunk of the creatures to disband, (Nova, Aleks, and some interns, one of which was flat out put out of a job BECAUSE of kootra for partnering with RoosterTeeth) and now its just Kootra, Danz, and some random interns. It is no longer really, *""The Creatures"".*
(They also left because of dumb schedule changes)




However, Nova, Aleks, and others formed their own crew, called ""CowChop"". The humor, content, EVERYTHING is **wildly** different to the creatures, showing that they were kinda being contained. They even have a *Video all about pornographic VR games* (Making their friend play it as they watch of course). And *Using a baby circumcision kit with a karambit knife*. Stuff that would be never done on the creatures. And plus I like that side rather than the modest side of the creatures. So I unsubbed from the creatures and subbed to CowChop.

Anyone commenting on the experience didn't live the experience, they're only commenting on how they would've felt with the knowledge/wisdom they have today and making assumptions with very small details on what is obviously a gigantic story full of lots and lots of complexity that fair amount of people couldn't comprehend (given a lack of, or shift in, experience).

I'm not saying anything is right or wrong, but personally i had some wild sexual experiences as a child and the only thing that fucks me up about it is that I didn't get to hash it out with the folks involved after I grew up and truly understood the implications of what went on in those treehouses and closets. Well, and the general weirdness instilled by everyone telling me how I should have felt much later in life. Not any of that weird, repressed Freudian whatever that every one says you're suppose to feel. 

So yeah, the previous commenter has a thought, but it's *one* thought, biased by folks who never could or would experience the experience or had their own experience that shaped them in their own way. I also realize I'm in the same boat, but I feel like it's worth mentioning all weird sexual things don't result in fucked up-ness. 

The dude lived that life, why would be not talk about it casually? Especially if he is moving or has moved the fuck on instead of dwelling on what someone else says he should be traumatized about. "

There's so much wrong with that scenario in the first place. Why on earth is *a child* being prosecuted for having sex, when they're not even old enough to consent to sex? That's at least statutory rape, and money changing hands doesn't change that. You shouldn't prosecute a child rape victim for their own rape. If anything, CPS should get involved to investigate child abuse."

"Hoarding and clutter avalanches. One match and that place would have been a death trap of flames. Later condemned after the first floor caved... well caved in the rest of the way/

My moms co worker, D and her daughters A and B, my childhood friend. I was about 8 or 9.

The first time I went to their house was for a sleepover/babysit. Mom had never been inside but she was in a pinch and needed someone to watch me because she had to go out of town for work. (Both single moms and all of us girls). We pulled up and ""wow"" we both said ""this house is nice"" compared to ours. Mom met Dee in the yard and then was on her way.

I was too young to really comprehend and Dee had told me not to tell my mom about the inside or God would punish me for gossip. Did I mention we all went to the same church. It was a very much ""GOD WILL SMITE YOU"" kind of church.

**Details:** Dee had lived in this house for about 10 years. The house was huge for the 3 of them. Well over 4000sqft probably close to 5500sqft with the basement. 5 big bedrooms, 2 were masters and 4.5 bathrooms. 2 floors with full basement. It was in a very nice, well established neighborhood. So this was 20+ years ago but low ball $400k to get into this area at the time well over a million now.

**Back to the first time I walked in:** There were paths to get to each room. Some areas were stacked to the ceiling. Bee the younger daughter who was my friend had made an effort to clean her bedroom that I would be staying in. There was just so much stuff, paper, trash, toys, clothes... filth. After her first attempt there was never another as she was only 6 or 7 at the time. Poor kid.

There was an upstairs master bedroom that I later learned was larger master bedroom. Well you could not open the door to this room and it hadn't been opened in 5 years. There had been a clutter avalanche that had blocked the door. This was Dee's original bedroom prior to divorce. She had filled it to the brim and one day something fell and the door wouldn't open, so she moved to the downstairs master/mother in law suite.

Later to find out after the house was condemned the room had been taken over by raccoons and such, later the house. Bee came to live with my mom and I when her house was condemned by the state (for the first time). She was 15 and I was 17 when that happened. We had grown apart but were still friends. I could tell then she was not okay and now she has some major clean/OCD/anxiety issues herself.

My mom came to pick me up and again we greeted her outside. I was so happy to leave. She asked me about the inside of the house ""big"" I would say. My mom did not go into the house until 2 years later when I told her about the clutter. She kind of forced her way in. Dee was good at manipulation and like I said mom was in a pinch.

**Other things I remember:**

1. The Kitchen.

* Sink was unusable. There was about 3 feet high of dishes stacked up, all dirty. Apparently the drain had clogged and the disposal broke.

* The dishwasher had exploded. Something went wrong with the door an had leaked water all of the floor. Except the water was some sort of old garbage disposal back up.

*  Roaches, gnats, and mice.

* The fridge had not been cleaned out in a very long time. I remember Dee getting some boxed soup mix thing from the fridge. After the first bite I could tell something was not right so I refused to eat it. She told my mom on me.

2. The Bathroom(2)

*   2 bathrooms were out of operation. One being the upstairs master. The second was the one directly below it on the main floor. Basically the upstairs toilet had leaked and it kind of fell through to the bathroom below. Fucking disgusting. Mold, mildew, wretched smell. They taped off that bathroom.

* The main bathroom they all used was just gross. Like hasn't been cleaned in 10 years gross. I refused to take showers when I was over there. I would find what looked like a clean clothe or towel and just wipe myself down. I would just let the water run so they would think that I took a shower. So yeah I would basically go without a real shower for 4-5 days on end. That was better than taking a shower in that bathroom

3. Other Rooms

* The living was stacked with mainly paper. This room is where I found the most comfort. While it was cluttered it was the ""cleanest"" room of the house. There was the one time though that I was sitting on the floor watching the ""Lion King"" and a stack of magazines fell on me. I never trusted that room again. I made myself a clean corner.

* Dinning room... haha no shit you could see the back of one chair and could walk about 1 ft into the room that had a 10 person table in it. Apparently filled with her ex husbands things. 

Needless to say those two years were awful. When I told my mom about the house she was shocked and did not believe me. My mom paid Dee to watch me while she was out of town. She traveled a lot for work. She was gone about 2 weeks out of every month, little did she know and I did not want to tell her because I knew she needed that job.

The older daughter A, is now a major hoarder like her mother. Her upstairs bedroom is what caused the rest of the 2nd floor to collapse. The weight and the rot finally took over that once beautiful home

The house was condemned a little less than 10 years ago. The bedroom collapse obviously caused some structural damage. One of the brick walls started to lean and a snowy week, bam it collapsed into itself. Even then, I am told from first hand accounts that it wasn't till a few weeks later that the state finally took action.

I remember the neighbors had been complaining for years but Dee had connections and money. She had driven off many neighbors over 20 years and the homes on either side of her remained foreclosed after the 2005 collapse. No one in their right mind would want to live next to that decrepit house.

Dee's house and the two next to her were bulldozed by the sate and HOA. They filled the basements and now there is just a pretty area, while empty. Dee still owns the land and is fighting tooth and nail to keep it to put up a new house. 

Dee is currently living with A in state housing. They have court ordered ""wellness"" checks.

"There's benefits to laws like this, though.

My dad tells me of when my aunt's first husband became abusive, and he literally threw her out of the house. She stayed at either his place or their parent's place for a week or so.

They both go to the house to try and collect her things while she knows he's at work, only to find he's changed all the locks so they can't get in. After walking around the property trying to find a way in, my dad looks at my aunt and asks, ""Is your name on all the paperwork for the house, signifying you both own it?""

"A friend and I had bicycled, with basic overnight gear, about 40 miles away from town and set up camp on remote edge of Sycamore Canyon.   The ride took all day and it was almost dark upon arrival.  This was quite sometime ago as the Blair Witch Project had been released in theaters a day or two prior.  My friend had seen it and was describing how spooky it was.   The internet was not widespread at the time and one way the creators of the movie had attempted to publicize their movie was by hanging missing person notices in post offices.  These missing person notices were of characters in the movie, as to give the movie are air of authenticity.  Well, my friend was convinced and was also visibly unsettled by the whole thing.  I had not seen the movie and was amused with how spooked he was.  Exhausted from the ride, I retired to my tent.   As I drifted into sleep I was snapped wide awake by what sounded like an old woman screaming bloody murder in the dark forest beyond.  It made my skin crawl.  The scream echoed again as my hair stood on end.  I listened wide eyed as the scream sounded off once more.  I then realized that all three screams were an exact facsimile of one another.  I thought for a moment and then it dawned on me that it was a fucking massive screech owl in the night.  At that moment I heard my friend frantically call out my name.  He was seriously panicked.  He called out, ""where are you and what is happening man?""  I called out that I was in the tent and he sprinted over and swan dove into the tent.  Translucently pale and beaded with sweat he asked ""what the hell is that!?""  I covered my grinning mouth and then parted two fingers and whispered, ""it's a bird.""  I then proceeded to lay in my sleeping bag and tearfully cackle my head off for the next hour.  It was fucking hysterical. "

"&gt; proper Dumbledore through the last four films.

Let me stop you right there. That actor was an *awful* Dumbledore through and through, but there is one scene during the last movie that particularly stuck out to me.



!!SPOILERS BELOW!!



It's the train station scene. A reprieve from all the chaos of the fight and Harry gets a surprise visit from Dumbledore, who explains a few things to Harry... and then starts crying. Full-on tears from the immovable parental figure grand wizard, and he begs, actually *begs,* for Harry to tell him he made the right decisions in fighting Voldemort. After years of being seen as the all-knowing head honcho, here he is exposing all his doubts and pleading for a bit of validation. That one scene humanized Dumbledore more than the previous six books combined, and it's one of my favorites.

And what does the movie Dumbledore do? He actually gives Harry a fucking wink and a chuckle before sending him off.

I was fucking *furious* when I saw that. Michael Gambon can get fucked with a cactus for all I care."

I subscribed to him again around December last year and I forgot how much I enjoyed his content, and it wasn't even too different from before!"

"Every once in a blue moon Rolling Stone has a good article worth reading but their reviews - music, film, whatever - are consistently shit. I seriously once saw a Rolling Stone reviewer compare the band Ghost to Metallica and Mastodon. The only explanation I can think of for that is that he never bothered listening to the album he was reviewing and just name-dropped the first couple random metal bands he thought of off the top of his head. 

** EDIT **

For those who don't know:

[Mastodon](https://youtu.be/fcvdkw6v3fE) (progressive metal)

[Metallica](https://youtu.be/K6LA7v1PApU) (thrash metal)

[Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFhqCXl5jb0) (classic hard rock/proto-metal)

"I gave up on my best friend. He's always been up and down with his life and ice been there for him time and time again. But this last time he lost it on me telling me to fuck off at first and that I've just been a fake friend this entire time. I tried for a month after this to see what was going on with him, turns out he hasn't been getting any of my texts and whenever we talked on the phone there was nothing there. Last time I saw him I made it clear I hadn't been ignoring him. He said he believed me but it's best I forget about him and there's no point in knowing anything about him. I haven't tried to contact him since because I feel like what's the point. Breaks my heart but I have nothing else to offer in the situation. Worst part is that it literally came out of nowhere. One day he just decided to tell me to fuck off"

"Jennifer had always enjoyed puzzles. As a child, she'd often knock a 300 piece jigsaw out in an hour. She liked watching other people solve puzzles too, the vicarious thrill when their faces had the light of discovery upon them.

She soon started building mouse mazes, testing pet store rodents memory, intuition, and problem solving. This one had set a record time, and it had really seemed to smile when it got the cheese at the end!

The paralytic she had laced it with froze his joy. Taxidermy was it's own kind of puzzle. How best to bend a creature's flesh without tearing? Breaking their tiny bones just enough to adopt anthropomorphic poses without collapsing entirely. Perfusing their bodies with formaldehyde while they still lived, yet keeping the fur from getting matted down by their draining lifeblood.

Jennifer needed a bigger maze. She needed to bend a man's flesh, needed to freeze that joy of discovery on a beautiful boy. The man who worked at the library had always seemed quick-witted, and so handsome! Yes, Jennifer would ask him on a date soon."

"One girl I knew in middle school was going through my iPod and saw that I had porn in my browsing history (100% honest here, wasn't even a legit search up just an ad that said something along the lines of 'Sexy moms want to meet you', the spammy type thing you see everywhere, I guess she saw that 'Sexy moms want.."" part and just assumed from there). She didn't confront me about it but began telling other people about it and soon the milf porn turned into lesbian porn and into gay porn then people thought I was legitimately gay for about 2 months. People that I didn't even know came up to me and asked me about it.

This went on for a little longer until somehow this 'gay' rumour turned into anal cancer of some sort. This somehow spread to my teachers and they started treating me differently, started giving me pillows to sit on or I would get the teacher's chair (usually a lot more cushioning than the standard desk chair) so I would be 'accounted for'.

I was amused at first at how the gay rumour came to be, but the anal cancer rumour, I had no idea how it came. It was like under the mill 'gay' for however long then in about 2 or 3 days the anal cancer becomes the biggest thing. I'm still not sure how it happened or who started that one. It's been years so it's far too late to find out too.

**TL;DR** Ads gave me anal cancer.

EDIT: Another rumour which was equally as dumb.

Some background for this; I come from a very 'religiously independent' family. Meaning that we each can have our own religion and study it on our own time. My parents were 'weird' like that, don't know why just was. But my mother was Hindu while my dad was in-between Islam and Athiesm (switches fairly often). My mother was seen more around and was generally more well known so everyone thought that I was Hindu as well, I was when I was younger but I wasn't at the time and never really 'demonstrated' my faith. So word spread and basically I was the one Hindu kid in school. Didn't fuss over it cause I really didn't care. Anyways I go to my local high school for about a year because I was missing some kind of credit from middle school or something before I transferred to another school. I left behind a lot of my friends but I told a few where I was going and what for. Lo and behold these kids could not be trusted for any reason. They told my peers that I dropped out to go live in Nepal and become a monk. I thought people would realize that it was complete bullshit based on how I behaved (was a pretty obnoxious little shit, always got into trouble). But nope, they believed it. Every single one of them. I've known some of these kids for over a decade and they all thought I actually became a monk. The next time I saw them was when I had graduated from high school and I went to their graduation ceremony to see off some of my closer friends.

Apparently my friends had created an entire life story about my travels and what I was doing. Doctored some of my pictures to look like a monk, and they were pretty convincing as well.

Here's a basic gist of my alternate history as a monk; 
&gt;Moved to Nepal, studied under a Guru for a year and had shaved all my hair from my head. Went dark for a little while as I lived in a forest with older men studying trees and plant life. Got excommunicated for a year because I had sexual relations with a goat. Was brought back in when I had raised a baby calf when it's mother died until it could live on it's own. Became a Guru myself and had been castrated to show abstinence from worldly behaviors. Went to India and had a temple built to commemorate me for being a Guru at a extremely young age. And then I had died on my way to said temple because of a rare disease that I had contracted while I had been with the goat from earlier. 

**TL;DR** Became a monk, died of goat AIDS."

"Not nearly as magnificent but I have one. Much like OP I found myself sitting uncomfortably a lot, and one day while still in class the pain was  getting unbearable on my left ass cheek. Anyways I find myself over at my grandparents' house, while I'm in the bathroom I can barely make out the monster on the inside of the cheek; it's game on now.

I poked at it with a needle and a toothpick, and I also tried grazing the skin to take care of the problem, but to no avail because I'm too much a pussy. Realizing something pointy wouldn't solve my problems, I began the 10 minute engagement of wrestling this fucker with just my hands. My body was twisting to both sides, hands in all different positions and angles trying to pop this monstrosity. 

Finally with a fierce squeeze a golden-redish ooze splattered all over the bathroom mirror relieving me of that hell with the pain going from throbbing to none in just a few minutes. That's the trophy pimple, the dragon I chase that I can never seem to find in my days popping since.

My other daughter had thrush and her pediatrician recommended treating it with apple cider vinegar. When my wife was trying to give her some this person grabbed my daughter's head and jerked it back causing my daughter to inhale the apple cider vinegar and get a lung infection.

The stress of the whole situation while we were out in the middle of nowhere caused my wife to miscarry. We didn't even know she was pregnant until we got home and they confirmed that the reason she was hemorrhaging was due to increased hormones from the pregnancy."

I don't agree to stay completely off the strip. It's worth going down in that area to check out all the hotels and casinos. Each one has a different theme with different architecture, and it's really cool to check out. Walk down the strip at night and see the fountains at the Bellagio, the volcano at The Mirage, etc. But if all you do is live on the strip while you're there, you're gonna get bored. Make your way downtown to Fremont Street and see the experience. There's also a phenomenal street performer there every night named [Carl Ferris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-5_OMTYU9g).

One of my favorite places to eat is the Firelight Buffet at Sam's Town. You can get almost anything you'd ever feel like eating there. Sam's Town is also just an awesome hotel/casino. I love the western theme and the atrium is really nice. The bowling alley is also really good.

Other places worth checking out are the Ethel M factory in Henderson. Their chocolates are awesome, and they also have a great cactus garden on the property. The mob museum I would imagine is pretty cool. I haven't been, but am looking forward to checking it out on my next trip. There's also the Atomic Testing Museum which gives good detail on the Nevada test site and all the work done during the early days of atomic testing.

You could also hop in the car and visit Red Rock Canyon, the Valley of Fire, and the Hoover Dam. You could also head down I-15S to Buffalo Bill's and ride the Desperado, which when it was built, was the tallest roller coaster in the world."

"Quick story.  When I was in high school I was placed in a youth psychiatric ward briefly due to severe depression (I was bullied quite a bit, no counseling really helped).  Now I was and am a perfectly sane individual, however this was not true for the other kids at said psychiatric ward.  A few days into my stay, this reasonably hot girl was admitted as a patient, we'll call her Jill.  She kind of sits down in the common area and looks around at
everyone else, taking in the environment.  Soon she stands up for whatever reason, and another patient, we'll call him Dave, went straight over and smelled the shit out of her seat with lustful glee.  I had never really seen anyone behave like this before and didn't know what to make of it.  The counselors came by and got him away from the seat.  One counselor's name was Roman.  Roman, if you ever read this, you were the man, and I'm sure you still are.

This was probably 9-10 years ago.  And I still have Jill's number in my phone.      "
"Above all, the inability to see that he's being inappropriate.

There are many guys who may hit on you and pursue you even though you are not reciprocating. To me, those guys are annoying. Not exactly creepy.

A creepy guy, is a guy who does fucked up shit, and is always surprised that you are not enjoying it. They find your number from a source that is not you and use it. That's classic. It's wrong on so many levels. The fact you had access to the information does not give you the authority to use it. If you didn't get the number from the person themselves, don't text them. Same with address. A creepy guy sees no problem with that. None. 
Once, i met a guy when i went to another city to visit a friend who studied there. He was my friend's classmate, he apparently liked me and tricked my friend into giving him my address. Told her he was gonna send me flowers. The day after i come back home, he showed up at my apartment.

A guy i used to talk online for years revealed that he was in love with me. I said it was never gonna happen, but we could still talk and be friends. He later sent me a picture of the tattoo he got on his back. My picture. His whole back. We never even saw each other in real life.

They ''find'' you. They see no problem with ''running into you on purpose''. They may wait outside your work, school etc. They don't see this as bad because ''they only wanted to see you'' and ''it's not like they're gonna hurt you''.

Being There - a great lesser-known Peter Sellers classic.
"I've posted about this before, but my best friend.

He's very smart, academically, he did well at all the schools he attended and like most people went off the university where he got his degree - and that's all he's done, he's sat at home for what is approaching 4 years now having never had a job, and from what I can tell he has absolutely no intention of even trying to find one. I've given up asking because I get the same reply every time it is incredibly depressing.

I've got an idea why - he's very stubborn. Unless you can back something up with hard facts that categorically prove he is incorrect he won't back down. I imagine his parents have been a bit soft and tried 'nudging' him in the right direction but he's argued with them as to why he's entitled to sit at home doing nothing and not contribute to the household, so they've given in and that's that. It kills me because he is incredibly smart and he's just wasting away at home putting his talents to spending all day playing video games and watching twitch streams. Sad. 

He's still my best friend and we have great conversations and good times but we do often do things that require money (not much, just meet up for drinks or something fairly local), and I just keep wondering where the hell it's coming from. I know he spent some time living off his student loan for a while but that dried up years ago, and I don't think he gets any welfare so unless his parents are just giving him money I've got no idea where it comes from."

"I have an extremely high sex drive, my husband....not so much. 

The very first thing we did was had his testosterone levels checked. Hornones being low is super common and really effects the sex drive. His testostedone was in the normal range, but on the low end of normal. So he began therapy (testosterone cream applied daily). That alone made a huge difference. He also started taking daily vitamins as he was low on vitamin D. His energy and sex drive went up significantly. 

Also it's sometimes useful if you can find something (watching porn) that you can do without expecting sex but might put you both in the mood.

I think the most important thing to remember is that most people see sex as a loving thing to do. Imagine coming home to your spouse and trying to talk about your day and they said ""I don't really feel like listening today."" It would make you feel like a pile of shit. I think its possible to have ""giving sex"", where you might not necessarily be in the mood, but you love your partner enough to have a quickie. It doesnt take long and means a lot. "

And, being the socially awkward pre-teen I was, I didn't want to embarrass myself by asking for it again. So I just went the whole year not knowing what this girl's name was.

In the span of one month you are exhibiting obsessive tendencies towards two different females. I have no doubt you have strong feelings for them, but you are not equipped to deal with these feelings on your own - as is evidenced by your posts in /r/legaladvice and /r/relationships. 
  
I've worked with individuals just like you, and I can honestly say that you're just one good counselor (and dedication to sessions with said counselor) away form really starting to understand yourself and your obsessive fixations with the opposite sex. You have a lot of hope, but if you try to do this your way you will be slapped with restraining orders, possible arrests and a criminal record and worse - maybe never get to participate in a healthy relationship.

"The biggest problem, imho, is that (many) American Christians have a complete inability to compartmentalize. By that, I mean they just cannot separate the politics and their faith into two separate categories. If they can't find a candidate whose politics are completely religiously based, they think the country will be run by Anton LeVay or something. 

I'm a Christian and used to subscribe to the mentality I mentioned above. Then I slowly began realizing that it's unAmerican to expect a nation that is home to those who don't believe the same as my religion to be run by strictly Christian principles and values. Same-sex marriage was a huge thing here; when other Christians would hear that I support a gay individuals right to marry, they would think I am somehow endorsing the entire lifestyle and therefore am a ""false prophet."" (I just want to clarify that I'm kind of on the fence about endorsing the lifestyle and I never hate, judge or bash gay individuals. How could I claim to serve a gracious and loving Lord if I'm going to mistreat or be prejudiced towards people that I disagree with? Besides, what I believe shouldn't influence the way other people feel and how they live their lives. This is America, people have the right to believe what they want, think what they want and, within reason, do what they want. But I'll understand if you disagree passionately and downvote me for the aforementioned sentiments.)

 In reality, it was just that I realized that the documents that built this nation guaranteed freedom to all Americans and that denying a gay person the right to marry who they love flew in the face of those freedoms we boast about. 

I despise that we have what seems like an entire generation/group of Christian people that use cyclical arguments. 

""WELL WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRONG AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELL!!!"" 
""But why?""
""'CAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS SO!""

You can't argue/debate with a person who already does not believe in your religion, and then use your religious book to prove that you are correct. I don't know how in the Sam-Hill that makes sense to anyone. 

Basically, the Religious-Right should ask themselves, ""would you like to live in a nation where official/national religion is Islam, Buddhism, etc? Okay, then don't expect others to live in a nation where Christianity is the official/national religion.""

**TL;DR** Religious Americans need to learn how to separate their religion and politics. It doesn't mean you are going against your beliefs, just that you aren't jamming them down other people's throats."

Instructions unclear. I now have a bird of prey in my living room. 
"Back in my day, when we only had landlines, taking a phone call during dinner was considered pretty rude, and even hearing the phone ring was an annoyance. 

You would be careful about when you called someone so as not to disturb people's meals. One of the pleasurable aspects about going out to eat was that you didn't have the potential to be interrupted by a call unless it was urgent (you told the important people where you would be and if they needed you, they just called the restaurant and the folks there would get you for the call). 

Now, people get the the meal and just plop their phone right there on the table.  People think little of just picking up there phone mid-meal and having a text conversation (*talking* on your phone as become almost obsolete) with somebody else right then and there. 

This is the way of the world now, and I have no intention of stopping it, but I still find it shockingly rude. As an example, I am still very close to my childhood best friend, it's always a big thing when I can come to visit and we can carve out a little time between work and family commitments to to have lunch or dinner together. Still, invariably during these meetings, she spends a lot of time texting or Facebook messaging with work friends and other people locally. She'll even spend 15 minutes texting about this or that with her husband, who she is going to in an hour or so. I rarely feel like I really have her full attention."

I personally feel like I am simply aware that I'm hungry so my thoughts would go directly to ""do I want to eat something now/what should I eat."""
"There's more to sex than ramming your dick inside her vagina repeatedly. You come, you go flacid, whatever, so what? You have fingers and mouths. Go down on her. Rub her clit. Finger her.

Asking her what she wants in that moment and having her tell you exactly how to touch her? what to do to her to make her come? Just because you come doesn't mean the experience is done. Sex is a team activity, a two-person game. She deserves exactly as much enjoyment, fulfillment, and orgasm as you do. "

I've always thought he was a nice guy. He took some xanax and drank and one night stabbed a dude in the neck. Shit, I still think deep down he's a good guy but I dunno how or why he would do that. 

His whole life he was a good dude, albeit maybe a bit down on his luck.. nothing about him would suggest he'd hurt someone like that. "

I spend a lot of time hiking when it's not raining here or too cold. Now I may not have too good of a sense of direction, but I have a stellar memory when it comes to path, so I have yet to be lost. I am also very good at remembering certain unique things if I hike off trail, like maybe certain flowers or a tree shape, and even snapping dead branches if it's in a more forest. Once I saw a path I have NEVER seen before and a hiking trail I was very familiar with. 

Being the exploring person I am, I decided, why not go down this somewhat steep dirt trail, so I went down...and down...and down further. It felt like I was walking down hill for 20 minutes when on a no so steep path I was only about 5-10 minutes from the bottom. I ahd no idea why a steeper incline felt long, but what struck me as odd is that at the bottom of this trial there was nothing to see. It was just a bunch of bushes, the ones that get those white berries, however it was early summer so not that time yet. It also looked swampy kind of...so why a did a trail lead to here? 

I looked around, because I might've missed something, no nothing. After that I noticed that there was no sound! All the birds I had heard before the trail had stopped at some point, and that when I heard the strange laughter, like people on four wheelers, in front of mean, when there clearly wasn't anybody. You bet your hat I ran right back up that trail, and it felt even longer going up, I only took one break to catch my breath before running again, as I was scared and I looked down from a higher point to see if I saw the men laughing, but nope just bushes, still heard the sounds, and nothing moving anywhere. I kept running and the sounds ceased. I recall speed walking and running back home. I went back on a hike the next day to show my dad the strange trail, and could not find it.

While I had went hiking alone and took longer than I usually did accompanied by a lack of phone, , my dad came looking for me up the main trail, conveniently I arrived home before he did without ever bumping into him.  When he got home he was glad to see me there and said he saw some old guy fapping in the woods with his pants at his ankles. It's scary to think I probably walked near some old guy fapping. Apparently he was pretty stoned sounding. "
"I was only a child when the buy back happened, though I never heard anything about it. Not sure if that was due to childhood oblivion or the fact that it wasn't a big enough (protests, news stories etc) issue to be stored in my memory. However, 20 years on, I have never heard of a single Australian that doesn't agree with our strict gun laws. 

I don't think a similar buy-back system would work in the US. Not only because of the population size and number of guns that people own there, but the culture is different. Australia never had the same level of gun ownership and a distrust in government that seems to be part of the US cultural fabric, so we just kind of go along with most things they tell us to do. 

There is a difference between buying a gun to protect your family and buying a machine gun - to me that is the issue, but I am not here to tell others how to live.

"The movie was Critters. First horror movie I ever watched. The year was probably 1991-92. The scene where you are the ""critter's"" perspective under a little girls bed rolling around waiting for your chance to bite the little girl. You see her feet step down from the bed and the perspective rolls towards the girls feet. *Spoiler alert* Nothing happens to the girl. Her dad ends up accidentally stepping on it and smooshes it dead. He thought it was her easter choclate but it was really her Easter demise he saved her from. Just the thought though of actually having a monster under my bed stuck with me for a long time. If I woke up in the middle of the night needing to go to the bathroom or something, I would stand up on my bed and jump as far away from it as possible giving myself distance to get away in case of ""Critters""."

"I was teaching 3rd grade. A kid who's usually under the radar, ""Eddie"", just lost it out of nowhere. A left handed girl was fumbling with the scissors and he snapped shouting ""YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CUT LIKE THAT!"" I tried to explain to him some people are left handed but he just kept screaming it's ""not allowed.""

I thought maybe this was his parents doing so I took his mother aside after school that day. Come to find out, she's left handed, and has no idea where that came from. I wrote it off as an off day. 

But it progressed. Eddie developed a bunch of arbitrary rules (what color crayons you can use in a picture, how many sheets of paper you can take off the shelf at a time, who can sit at which desks) and absolutely *flipped* if the kids didn't play along. 

The thing was, he was super charismatic. He actually convinced a bunch of kids to follow his rules. Then when anything didn't go his or his friends way (did poorly on a test, recess cut short, even if they got a cold) he'd blame it on the kids who wouldn't follow his ""rules"". He was leading a bizarre cult of third graders, and got them to recruit others. Preaching following his rules would solve all their problems. 

I tried to break it up one day and he started all out battling, pitting the kids who subscribed to his rhetoric against in a shouting match (only they were shouting, I was trying and failing to talk to them down.)

Foaming at the mouth, flailing his arms, shouting about how ""the rule breakers are the problem. They made all the bad things happen to you! We have to get rid of them if they don't want to do things the right way!"" 

In that moment, he reminded so much of Hitler. 

It's four years later and Eddie's a smart kid, skipped a grade. But he's misogynistic loner who's mad at the world.  School shooter in the making if you ask me. He made a name for himself when he flipped a lunch table shouting at a girl who turned him down for a date ""you don't respect me and everything I've done for you, for all women!"" 

He graduated from our school this year, thankfully..... "

"&gt; Anne as an individual 

I'm so happy to see someone else feel this way. You'd be surprised how few people even think of her as an individual at all - she's placed on the tragic-victim pedestal and that's that. It's doing her a disservice, and it numbs the pain of the collective memory of the Holocaust, a pain that has to be felt so that history doesn't repeat itself. 

Also kids/teens can benefit so much from a book like this. In its unedited form, her diary can make kids feel less alone, can show them that perhaps their parents and grandparents went through frustrations like their own, and that they're normal and good. And it can do all that without sounding patronizing because it simply isn't - she's talking to herself. Books written by adults can't have that level of authenticity.

"My wife teaches young children, from babies to kindergarten. She has her degree in child growth and development. To her, one of the most disturbing trends has been what we like to call [Showtime Oven](https://youtu.be/GG43jyZ65R8) parenting. If you grew up in the golden age of infomercials, you've probably seen Ron Popeil in front of a large studio audience with a variety of meats distributed throughout a small army of Showtime Ovens. Who could forget the tag line? 

""SET IT AND FORGET IT!""

So what does a rotisserie oven have to do with small children? Well next time you're out in public, look around for parents with their children.  More often than not, you'll notice that as soon as their hands are strong enough to hold them, parents are handing their kids smartphones and tablets. To parents, these devices are magical. Hand one to your kid, and instantly they become silent and docile, hypnotized by the screen. 

For example, last year, I was at a super bowl party and a new father / friend of mine brought his toddler along. He was a handful. He ran around, yelled, threw stuff and generally annoyed people. The solution? Bust out the iPad, sit the kid on the couch and give it to him. His eyes glazed over, and he didn't bother anyone for the remainder of the game. Set it and forget it. 

So what's the matter with Showtime Oven parenting? It accomplishes the goal of getting the kid to shut up so you can do whatever it is you're trying to do. 

1) It deprives the children of a variety of sensory experiences. Think about when you were a kid. What did you play with when you were away from home? Blocks, coloring books, puzzles, toy cars, dolls, books, action figures, etc. These toys offer a multi-sensory experience that devices cannot. 

When you hand a child a coloring book, they see the image on the page, they have to exercise their fine motor skills to draw within the lines. They crinkle the paper, and it's tough to the touch. They can smell the book and the crayons. Most the time, they end up putting the paper and crayons in their mouth. This combination of experiences is essential to the developing brain. All of those sensory experiences are being replaced by the much more sterile experience offered by a screen, and thus their sensory stimulation is very limited.

2) The games and videos these children are experiencing are not developmentally appropriate for their growing minds. Giving them a fast paced game or a cartoon full of flashes and cuts can overload their mind. They do not grasp the passage of time in these shows. That's why more appropriate shows like sesame street are shown in real time and with minimal cuts. 

For analogy's sake, feeding a child's mind a steady diet of fast paced cartoons and games is like giving a teenage boy a laptop with Pornhub open. In the way that teen's perception of sex will be warped by watching hours of porn, so will a child's perception of reality. They will want everything to be as satisfyingly fast paced as their games. This leads to more of the shitty behavior you gave them the phone to prevent in the first place. I can almost certainly say (but I haven't got the scientific proof to back it, so take it with a grain of salt) that extended exposure to devices will result in a greatly increased chance of ADHD.

3) Missed interactions with parents and other people / children. These are another critical component in the development of speech and socialization. To maximize the development of their speech, children need to be talked to and read to. They need to interact with other people and kids to learn social norms. My toddler nephew was raised by an iPad, and now he regularly smacks the shit out of his little infant brother. Instead of spending time with other kids learning that hitting is unacceptable, he had his nose buried in an iPad. His speech is also running behind and demonstrates specifically a lack of adjectives and thus the inability to form complete sentences. Every time my wife watches over him, she makes a point to guide him around and describe everything around. For example, outside she will call his attention to ""the rough gray sidewalk"" or ""the crunchy green grass"" or ""the soft, wet brown dirt"".

Now this is not to say children should never be exposed to technology at a young age. Limited exposure to screens, using developmentally appropriate material can be a boon to their learning. It should absolutely not be used as a babysitter, though."
THAT doesn't make me roll my eyes. That makes me want to strangle people.

"We had a patient who was having trouble breathing. We gave oxygen and albuterol and were loading them into the ambulance for further treatment. Right as we lifted the stretcher up, he slumped over. We get him inside and he doesn't have a pulse, so we start doing CPR/working him. We get a pulse back fairly quickly (it was a non-shockable rhythm), and start transporting him. We get to the hospital and hand him over.

We take another patient later and the doctor seeks us out and commends us on what we did (which is SUPER rare btw, doctors barely talk to us most the time, they'll ask the nurses questions while we are in the room giving a report to that same nurse). He was transferred to Cardiac ICU, and we learned later he was released pretty soon afterwards. "

"This reminds me of something that happened about a week before I turned 21.  I had been drinking at a friends house about 3-400 yards from my own home.  To save you the details and keep this short, the cops were called and ended up arresting almost everyone.  Because I was so close to being 21 and I was the only one not giving them a hard time or trying to fight with them, they decided to let me go home with just a warning.  They obviously weren't going to let me drive my car, but they also wouldn't let me walk back to my house, so they had an officer drop me off at home with my car keys and the promise that I wouldn't go pick up my car until I had slept it off and was sober (which was not a problem for me).

The best part was about 10 minutes after they dropped me off, I hear my car alarm start to go off.  So I grab my car keys and walk back over to the house and with all the cops staring at me, opened the car door and shut the alarm off.  I then turned and said ""I'm leaving my car keys on the seat.  It's going to go off again if you open it up, so just turn it off next time."" and walked back home to go to bed.  "

"They get in the way a lot.  

You try to my flat on your front but you can't. 

They catch any crumbs or food when your trying to eat which is annoying and gross.

 If they are big, you have to wear under wire bras which after a while get worn and the sharp curved metal breaks through and starts trying to stab you, if you're at work you get to go through the rest of the day trying to act like you don't have sharp metal cutting into your chest.

If you try not to wear a bra, or pick a bra that doesn't stab you then you get serious back and neck pain from lack of support.

When you have larger boobs they stop carrying bras in department stores.  Then you have to buy online and spend about $60 EACH for something that will wear out in about 5 months and stab you.

The bras for bigger boobs have thicker straps for the extra support.  So you have to consider the neckline of any shirt or dress to avoid showing the straps or back of the bra.

When you buy shirts you need to get a size big enough to fit them.  So you end up straining the shirt where your boobs are, but have it super loose everywhere else.  Which gives you a frumpy look while looking like your boobs are exploding.  If you get a fitted shirt, it looks like you are showing them off and inappropriate."

Editing to reply to the four people below me (though I shouldn't have to, seeing as it's literally in the comment at the top of this chain): Nobody in Australia owns a gun for self-defence (as in, that's actually not a legal reason to own a gun, and illegal firearm possession is taken very seriously here). The idea that a gun is what you might turn to for self-defence seems ridiculous when gun crime simply isn't something the average civilian has to worry about. The idea that most confrontations would escalate to such deadly tools is bizarre to us. Also, we have a serious problem with drunken brawl fatalities, the last thing we need is for our population of drunken tossers to start carrying guns ""for self defence"", yeah sure, that'll end well here."

"The Abyss is a 1989 science fiction film directed by James Cameron about a research crew in a deep sea oil rig discovering intelligent alien life. 


Considered one of the hardest film shoots of all time, it filmed in the largest underwater film set ever constructed. All cast and crew had to go through dive training for months. The tank was so large that they actually had to depressurize before they could surface. the entire thing was super stressful, super physically demanding, and super dangerous. ed Harris almost drowned and he broke down crying on his way home that day. crazy crazy film shoot, i highly recommend the documentary about it. 

And with all that said, it really paid off imo. One of my favorite movies and honestly probably James Cameron's least known movie (nobody talks about it anymore) but its easily one of his best and thats really saying something. 

Similar to how 2001 was a super accurate depiction of space travel, the abyss is a super accurate depiction of underwater habitation. I actually read somewhere that they had to develop new diving technology for the movie that then became widely used (though i am not positive about that) 

anyway thats enough rambling, seriously go watch the movie!

i just hope it comes to blu-ray eventually...

EDIT: it was also one of the early pioneers of realistic CGI. The technology and techniques developed for the film would go on to be used for terminator 2 and then Jurassic park, it was a pretty pivotal movie for the development of modern visual effects. It was also the first movie to use an early version of photoshop. 

EDIT 2: here is part 1 of the documentary, looks like the whole thing is online once again check it out!

The rocks (medals included) were soon dug up and taken to the river to reinforce a bank. My mom was pretty upset."

"Basically a trigger is something that aggravates a latent traumatic or mental health issue in a person. So say if you were someone who had suffered through a history of domestic violence, encountering a video or text post about domestic violence might cause you to emotionally relive some of those experiences and have severe consequences for your health.


So a trigger warning is basically giving people who have those problems a heads up that ""hey, this post might not be great for your health"" so they can avoid it."

The witch has some inner monologue about her fear of water and the dark, but Dorothy doesn't know this (this might help answer /u/0510521's question).  Dorothy throws the bucket of water on the witch because she is angry at her for stealing one of her silver shoes (Ruby in the movie).

Neither the book or the movie explains why the witch had a bucket of water lying around despite her knowledge that it will kill her.

This is my favorite part:

&gt;Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the door. "

"My high school initially had that rule, but of course many people kept breaking it. So when they designed the new uniform, they designed it so the shirt wouldn't be tucked in. However, according to my sister, who started school the year the new uniform was introduced, some teachers didn't know and would tell the students off. Others continued wearing the shirt tucked in out of habit or preference. For the next few years, I had some periods where I tucked it in, some where I didn't. 

The new policy was much better though as the teachers didn't really tell us off either way after a while.


Also, the new uniform had no tie, which I much preferred."

"I think there's a difference between snooping just because you're a jealous and insecure person and are looking for some shred of something to be pissy about or just to pry, and ""snooping"" because your husband disappeared for several days and came back drunk and you have every right to suspect him of something and have good reason to believe he wouldn't be honest about it if you asked him. I fault you not at all for looking in his phone. I would do the exact same, because if someone is abusing your trust they don't deserve your trust. Don't feel bad about it or apologize about it to random Internet douchecanoes, be glad you had the gumption to look and the strength to end it."

"*Adults* are apex predators, but big cats, sharks and anacondas will all hunt and eat crocodiles. Due to territorial disputes, hippos will also kill crocodiles. Furthermore, baby crocs get predated quite a bit. 

The leap of logic that the planet would be swarming with crocodiles if they were biologically immortal doesn't pass muster. They'd sooner start killing eachother than share that much territory, they're not social animals.

Edit - and note, I'm not saying crocodiles are biologically immortal. This is the first I've heard of that and it doesn't sound quite correct. My point is the ""truthy"" leap of logic here is the same sort of silly idea that you're chastising ""non-biologists"" for."

"I'm a swimmer and I've had this explained to me a lot...

The lzr racer and other suits like it were banned because fina (international governing body) saw that the suit added more buoyancy  to the swimmer. The suits were extra thick and had panels of rubber material on them that were much more buoyant compared to past technical racing suits. Also because of the extra material covering the entire leg and the added torso on men, pockets of air could be made in the suit. Some swimmers went as far as wearing two suits to take advantage of these air pockets. These advantages were shown when almost every world record was broken in these suits. 

Fina saw this as unfair (called it technological doping). To combat this they made it so men can only wear suits from the waist to above the knee, and women from the shoulders to above the knee. They also said that suits must be made from a woven material, and you can't wear more than one suit.

Manufacturers adapted to these rules. Tech suits now are still a fucking pain in the ass to put on (30 min usually if it's brand new) and cost a fuck load of money($200-$500). They are also still a hell of a lot more water resistant than the conventional polyester suit because of the texture and material of the suit(shark inspired or not). The new suits however are still a remarkable feat of engineering, and children and adults wear them in competitions ranging from local to international all the time.

"That's not entirely accurate. The average size is 3-4 inches but just like the penis, the vagina can change sizes when aroused, causing the cervix to move back. The size of increase is, I think, an additional 4-8 inches. This also happened during childbirth. Think about it this way if the average penis is 5.5 inches and the average vagina is 3.5, then the average man would be punching the cervix making sex uncomfortable for everyone but the smallest dicked guys. If sex is uncomfortable for the woman, the biggest problem is probably arousal. Not just is she in the mood, but is her body ready. So no having a large penis isn't wasted, but guys shouldn't be worried about the length of their penis anyway. I can guarantee its long enough to procreate, it's probably bigger than you think it is, and most of the nerves are closer to the doors anyway. What you should actually be worried about is girth. Little noodle dicks take a lot of wiggling to get the job done. "
"I don't know how many, if any, men you have had sex with, but in GOOD hetero relationships, women generally receive their pleasure first, because men know that when they are done, they are done. That means there is a lot of oral, fingers, rubbing, kissing, penetration, etc, hopefully with a woman having an orgasm. It's very similar to having sex with a woman, if you are having sex with a considerate man. It's just there is a definite ending point for many hetero couples, so things have to be done in a certain order if you want all the boxes checked.

I've had considerate, and completely inconsiderate, but the inconsiderate ones were in high school and I think a lot of it came from lack of experience in knowing how to pleasure a woman. "

The inference is that the entire world was simply waiting for America to solve the problem whilst the rest of the world waited for those much more superior, clever yanks sort it out and save us all.

Also Bill Pullman's speech is the epitome of American war propaganda and I know that most of the rest of the world were irked by it and openly scoffed it. While America did a collective chest swell and wiped a tear.

"Not really sure why you're asking this, but yes, quite a bit of it.

You've got to keep in mind that after the Port Arthur massacre, the new gun laws had widespread support across the country. People liked seeing the piles of disarmed guns awaiting destruction and plenty of politicians held media events at the facilities where destruction of guns was occurring.

If the guns weren't actually being destroyed, you'd think they'd have had to have kept the media out of those facilities a lot more than they did.

Aside from that, what possible use does the government have for massive piles of random assortments of weapons in varying levels of disrepair? It's not like the military or police would want them. Those people have access to brand new, high quality weapons at all times.

Once the government have all those guns (over 650,000 of them iirc), what else would they have done with them?"

...and that I really don't like most people. I don't need lots of friends, because 90% of the people on earth aren't people I actually like or could enjoy a friendship with. So I'll just have a *few* friends, thanks, and also my self respect."

"I'm gay. In the wrong side of my twenties, and a Texan. I have my boyfriend of 2 1/2 have years. I'm legitimately terrified. I am a survivor of gay bashing and I lived to see the old days, well at least the tail end. My boyfriend is a few years younger than me and missed those days by a hair, I got to see public opinion sway and change. Meanwhile l, remember sodomy being a jailible (sp) here. You DID NOT hold hands and kiss in public back then, you were excused from restaurants for those things. Gay bars were my haven. 

One time, outside the bar I was attacked. I thought I was going to die. I was 18. They beat me mercilessly. I begged for my life, I begged for my mother, I will never forget that feeling. I'm pretty sure, I pissed myself in fear. Someone saw them and they scattered. They cleaned me up in the bar, and sent me on my way despite protests that I should be hospitalized. I was escorted back to my car and I left. Things stick with you, and that feeling, that dark finality, never left. 

I was not in Orlando, but I know exactly how they felt in those final moments. The fear, the panic, all of it. Reading the news Sunday morning, that moment had to play on a loop for me at least 100 times, and has continued for almost 4 days. I've cried nonstop, for the victims, their families, the entire community I've come to call my family. Jesus I'm crying right now. I haven't slept in two days. 

Now my boyfriend, who is a few years younger has taken my place at the club scene. I'm too old for it anymore in my mind, partied out. He goes to places just like The Pulse, places that I would've haunted in my days, before this strapping young lad mysteriously wound up with a beer gut. That feeling and the thought that he could go out, and I'd never see him again, it's now terrifying. It's kept my eyes from drying out since I'd heard. 

I hugged my mother hard, and cried for a long time. I wish I could do the same for the victims and their families. 

My boyfriend doesn't know why I'm crying so much. I've tried explaining what's happening, but the age gap is large enough, that he doesn't quite get it. He doesn't understand the fear. 

I had to have the talk about what to do in these situations and I just told him, if you see it happening just run. Don't stop to help people, the best you can do is get to a first responder. Give them all the info you have. I'm sure it sounds selfish and it is. But I'm not sorry, when it's all clear, do whatever you can to help. If you can't get out, take cover, get anyone you can under that cover. Contact the police. The more info they've got the better. "

When dealing with a live shooter and police are on the scene, do you really want to be a civilian ""hero"" brandishing a firearm, when police are searching for a civilian with firearms? When they specifically teach you to NOT be a hero when they give you your carry permit?

The idea of some random streetwalker/ace shooter breezing in and smoking a gunman in the skull, and being reigned a national hero seems a lot more of a Hollywood pipedream than a statistical reality. I would be willing to wager that many people with a carry permit, while fully capable of using their firearm respectfully, don't have the mental fortitude to even attempt at being that hero in a staggeringly stressful situation such as a mass shooting. I wouldn't even exclude myself here.
Now, I'm not saying there aren't extremely well trained people with a carry permit by any stretch of the imagination, but the likelyhood of them being the guy on the scene is obscenely low, and probably why it never happens."

"If I understand it correctly, they're not mutually exclusive. An event can be both a hate crime and act of terrorism. But they don't mean the same thing.

Terrorism has the intent to further some political or religious agenda by scaring the public. 

So, and if anyone reading this finds this to be wrong, please correct me - say someone devoutly follows a religion that's terribly anti-gay. Specifically targeting gay people would satisfy the hate-crime aspect, but it also upholds their religious doctrine and furthers their religious agenda, so is therefore also an act of terrorism. I think. "

"The [Piper Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Alpha) oil platform disaster on 6th July 1988. In short a badly designed rig, bad working practices and bad safety training resulted in the deaths of 165 crew members and 2 crew members of a rescue boat. 

On 6th July 1988, massive upgrades were taking place aboard the platform. A maintenance team had shut down one of two condensate gas compressor and removed it's safety valve for recertification. Permission to do this was granted by the production operator who signed a 'Permit to Work' stating the nature of the work to be carried out on the valve. A seperate permit was issued for the pump itself. The maintenance crew did not finish work on the valve before the end of their shift so their supervisor returned to the rig's control room with the permit and just left it on the desk without informing the production operator who was busy at the time. 

Later in the evening the other condensate compressor pump siezed up and failed due to a problem with it's antifreeze system. The production crew, after trying to restart the pump several times, went to the control room to check if they could activate the other pump that was missing it's valve. Because the permit for the valve had been dumped on the desk with no handover, nobody had notified the night shift that the pump was missing it's valve. To make matters far wrose, the two permits (pump and valve) were stored in seperate boxes because they were located in different sections of the rig. 

Seeing that the pump's permit stated that the pump was ready to go and not having seen the permit for the valve, the production crew turns on the shut down pump. High pressure condensate shoots out of the pipework were the valve had been with a deafening shriek. It takes barely 10 seconds to find an ignition source. There is a big gas explosion. Now here is where the rig's bad design comes into play. The control room, fire pumps and lifeboats were ALL located close to the module where the explosion took place. Because the fire walls were not explosion proof, fragments of wall shoot through the modules like a shotgun blast, rupturing ANOTHER condensate line in the oil storage and seperation module, starting a massive crude oil fire. 

With the control room knocked out, the surviving operators cannot sound the rig's emergency alarms and the fire control panel is offline. The backup fire pumps are also turned off because the rig OIM (Offshore installation manager) had ordered the automatic pumps set to MANUAL start due to the risk of divers being sucked into the intakes. The control room crew shut down what oil equipment they can and are forced down towards the sea due to acrid black smoke and fire. With the departure of the control room operators, the rig's command hierarchy falls apart. The 200+ crewmen still on the platform meet in the rig's accomodation module to await helicopter rescue. 

Except there is a crude oil fire. Helicopters cannot land on the rig to save the crew because the air is filled with thick black smoke. The lifeboats have been smashed. There is no surviving command structure to order the men to find any way possible to escape the platform. As the men wait for a rescue that won't be coming, a second massive gas explosion guts the platform. A gas riser that connects the Piper to another nearby oil platform ruptures, spewing nearly 30 tonnes PER SECOND of high pressue methane into the Piper, which of course ignites in a 300ft high fireball. 

How did that gas riser burst? A combination of factors. Burning oil from the production module leaks down through the floor of the module onto a metal grating where the rig's divers prepare to work. Because they don't want to step on the gratings with bare feet they put down rubber matting on the grates. This matting acts as a collection vessel for pools of burning oil, which burn merrily. Unfortuantely the high pressue gas riser from the neighbouring Tartan rig passes right over this area, causing the fire to melt the pipe and trigger the gas fire. 

Insufficient fire training means that the crewmen trapped in the accomodation module have left fire doors open, causing the accomodation mdoule to be filled with smoke. Most of those killed in the disaster asphyxiate waiting for a helicopter rescue that was impossible from the start. As the night wears on, two more high pressue gas risers, one from Claymore Alpha and one from the MCP-01 compression platform rupture in sequence, contributing another 30 tonnes of as per second to the fireball. The rig is rapidly melting. Finally, at 23:30, the rig begins to break apart. The accomodation module slips into the sea taking the sheltering crew down with it, and soon all this is left in the burning wellhead module. 

It would later be discovered that the crews of Claymore Alpha and Tartan Alpha continued to pump oil and gas to the Piper Alpha despite knowing that the rig was on fire, because they felt that the fire would be controlled and their bosses had ordered them to continue production unless expressly ordered to shut down by their bosses in Aberdeen. 

A classic case of the 'Swiss Cheese' model of disaster occurence. If the permits to work system was setup correctly, the production crew would have known not to activate the second pump. If the firewalls had been upgraded, the explosion would not have caused a crude oil fire. If the backup fire pumps had been set to automatic start then the fire could have been contained. If the Tartan and Claymore operators had been properly trained in multiple rig emergencies and not been given a greedy directive, then the fires would not have been fed. If the divers had not placed rubber matting on the gratings then the gas riser would not have burst, condemning the Piper Alpha to a fiery demise. 

TL:DR, Oil rig. Badly designed, bad operating procedures, bad crew training, bad safety training, BIG BOOM, lotsa fire, lots of deaths. "

"I certainly enjoyed the book, although I don't know if I'd say nothing happens. A lot of the humor comes from the dialogue, or a characters inner monologue, and I feel like the focus is really on that - the individuals and the situations they find themselves in, not as much the ""action"" of the story. Each chapter (or the major majority) is the name of a character, and they often give you a little more insight into what makes that person tick. 

Another aspect that might throw some people off at first is that the plot isn't told in chronological order. Time skips forward and back,  always after or before, but hardly ever making reference to the present. There are a few themes that help identify the progression of the story, one of the more notable ones being the required number of bombing runs our hero Yossarian has to complete. If you get the chance, I think it's a great book. Easily one of my favorite reads.

""This occurred in Portland, Oregon at the end of July.
So, I was really stupid and drank way too much. I was unable to get a ride home, so I took the bus. This was after telling several people I really wanted to go home and that is all I wanted to do. On the bus ride, I blacked out, so the rest of the story is what I heard from the police.
After I got off of the bus, I fell on the sidewalk and was unable to stand. A man in a pickup truck stopped and drug me to his car, hitting my head on the door and putting me inside. A witness followed his car, where he drove me over twenty minutes to a different county to his mobile home. He drug me out of the car and up the steps into his home. According to the witness, I was unable to stand or support myself and didn't appear to know what was going on. The police arrived six minutes after I was taken into his home, where they found weapons, sex toys, and chains. I was told by several officers that they don't believe I would have been seen again, had someone not followed and saved me.
The detective assigned to my case said that there was no case, because they couldn't prove kidnapping, as I couldn't remember the situation and I was not considered incapacitated by Oregon law, but when I looked up the legal definition, I was legally considered incapacitated. I called the supervisor, and he said he did not see anything in the report of me falling or being drug, even though that is what I was told by two different officers.
Is there anything I can do? I know it has been a while, but I was really traumatized by what happened and didn't feel up to fighting both my kidnapper and the police force. Now I feel obligated to get this predator off of the streets."""

"First time eating dinner at a friends house. The house is full of animals. It's like a zoo. I lived on a farm, surrounded by animals all the time. They stayed in the barns or the fields. This was a zoo. In their house. Cages of rodents in every room. Fish tanks in every room. Lizards. A pot belly pig. Cats. Dogs. Only thing they kept outside was the goat. I didn't even have a goat on the farm.

Anyways, after dinner.... and I mean right after eating, the dishes were lowered to the dishwashers... A.K.A. the dogs. They licked those plates clean. Spotless. I thought to myself - ' oh, that makes sense. now they will just put them in the sink and wash them."" But no. No... No. Then they went straight to the cupboard.

"#Warning: Spoiler alert, trigger warning, NSFW and all that.

This is definitely a cameraman/director thing. In the 90s, I used to have a porn tape (VHS, I know, right?) called ""The Coven"". This was high production value, really nice, and they had this scene where four women were ""initiating"" a fifth ('initiate' was standing, bent over, two women holding her arms out, one using a toy from behind, and one doing a spell or something in front of her, IIRC), and as the woman with the toy was about to do her thing, off camera, I heard a male voice going, ""Just like that, there ya go.""

"Yes. Also more importantly people shouldn't wait for a tragedy like this to donate.

Edit: I didn't mean to compare Phil to a rapist.  In hindsight I should have done more to separate my not having played Fez yet with the hypothetical Devil-Hitler original in the second paragraph.  I've seen Indie Game the Movie, and I do not hate Phil, I just think of him when I see Fez."

"When I was in the 7th grade my parents decided that I should be home-schooled because I wasn't focusing much in school. Both of my parents worked full-time jobs, so they couldn't home-school me. My mother met a family through a friend that offered to home-school me in her home along with her four children of various ages.  

The youngest child was a ~7 year old girl. When her mother served her lunch, she also placed a timer near the plate. She had to eat *all* of her food within the allotted time. If she didn't finish her food before the timer buzzed, her mother would take her into a bedroom and scream at her as loud as she could. It sounded like she was also being spanked with a belt. The screaming was so awkward.  

What is also strange is that her three other kids (all boys) didn't have this rule. They could eat whatever they wanted, whenever, wherever, and take as long as they liked. I went back to public school within the year."

This is my favorite recipe for rolled fondant.

Just make sure you refrigerate the fondant for at least 6 hours before using and then knead about 1 more cup of powdered sugar in, depending on the humidity level.

"I unsubbed because of them wrote a book that was pretty bad and I couldn't take them seriously anymore. I had already lost interest in them, but I still watched one of their videos every once in a while. After I read ""The Ables"" though I just...I couldn't watch the videos. That sounds stupid but...

The book was about this blind kid who goes to school for superheroes. The thing is though, the author didn't seem to have done any research into what it's like to be blind? I mean I'm not blind myself but...(spoilers) at one point the kid can magically see again (yeah kind of ruins the point of having a blind hero) and he can read. Like...If he was born blind he wouldn't know how to read. He never learned. Throughout the story up to that point he reads with braille. The plot was pretty boring and the characters were one dimensional too, but the obvious poor research done into something as important your main character being blind is just too dumb for me. Also (another spoiler) one kid loses an arm and at one point there's a line that goes something like ""[character with one arm] put both hands on their shoulders"" Now, if he was one arm, how is going to put both hands on something?

The podcast was like that and so was pretty much all the Let's Plays and all those related shows. Now everything feel like such a big production and a big promotion for everything else they do (look at how many let's play videos include people from the other parts of RT like kinda funny and the creatures and all that), and worst of all in my opinion, everything feels so rigid and forced.

"In the trees? That's the man in black, Jacob's brother. A long, long time ago, Jacob and the Man in black were taken from their mother and were raised by a woman called ""Mother"". The long and short of it is: Jacob believes that humans, despite their flaws, can have good in them. The man in black believes that humans are evil and without prompting, are naturally bad. After an encounter with the heart of the island, however, the man in black became a smoke monster who could take the form of the dead. With a lot of other things going on in between, Jacob brings candidates to the island to both prove the man in black wrong and find a successor, whilst the Man in Black wants to manipulate the candidates into killing Jacob so that he may turn off the light at the heart of the island, which is essentially like a cork in a bottle; it keeps everything on the island, inside the island. If the light is turned off, the man in black can leave the island. In the first season, Locke explained to Walt the rules of Backgammon. ""Two players. Two sides. One is light, one is dark"". Jacob and his brother also played Backgammon frequently; the bodies they find in the caves are the man in black and Mother, and near their bodies is two backgammon pieces, one is light, one is dark. The fight between Jacob and the man in black is essentially Backgammon, a battle of minds and spirit, not of strength, as the two cannot harm one another.  I can't really explain it better than this, because there are so many additional things to add that it would be hard not to spend all night writing.

The numbers are the candidates. 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. Jacob seemingly didn't know what the numbers meant either, because it turns out that they are actually the final six candidates. There is some confusion with Candidate 42, as it's unsure which Kwon it is referring to (Jin or Sun). The numbers are used seemingly everywhere and are important both on the island and off. They are not 'cursed' as Hugo seems to believe, but those bad things had to happen so that Hugo found himself on the island (he would have never visited Sydney otherwise). The numbers being input into the computer could have been anything, but due to the numbers power, for some reason that was the code the DHARMA initiative chose.

The final six are:

4 - Locke

8 - Reyes

15 - Ford

16 - Jarrah

23 - Shephard

42 - Kwon


I'm really sorry if this didn't make much sense. Your questions were in essence ""what happened during the entire six seasons"", so difficult to answer in short. Hope I explained, however.

You're the best technology humanity has ever produced. Your armour is superior to the enemy's and you have trained for years to get to this point. **But you still aren't enough to stop them.**

You kill thousands of troops on the ground. You fight them and push them back, take back Sword base. You even head into orbit and destroy a covenant supercarrier. **It still isn't enough to stop them.**

You evacuate cities as they are turned to glass around you. (New Alexandria was a beautiful mission in this way) You charge into battle and manage to nearly rout the covenant from Reach. You consistently accomplish everything that you can, and more. **It isn't enough.**

The story of Reach is about the planet and not so much the Spartans. To me it was about the complete hopelessness by the end of the human-covenant war."

"Back in Cata I was leveling my Worgen Mage once in the Badlands, I came across a Horde Priest (Blood Elf, Female), I had no intention of fighting her so I ignored her, only she attacked me. I suck at PVP but she had to be even worse because I killed her easily.

So, I continue leveling giving it no extra thought and then 10 minutes later, I get nuked by a level 85. I rolled my eyes at the power trip, then run back to my corpse, only to get nuked again. Oh, so the dude is camping my corpse, oh well. I res at the graveyard, intending to hearth back to Stormwind and log out.

...Only to get killed by a level 85 Hunter, who was in the same guild as the person who killed me twice prior. I res a couple more times at the graveyard, getting killed each time, when I get shuffled to a different graveyard (Which I didn't know was a thing, but apparently is)... 

ONLY TO GET KILLED BY A LEVEL 85 SHAMAN IN THE SAME GUILD. I knew something had to be up, so I just logged the fuck off my Mage and onto my Priest (85) and took a flight out to Badlands. After flying around a bit, I noticed an unusual sight. A shitton (At least 15) level 85's, all in the same guild, on flying mounts following a low level Priest in the same guild.

That Priest, being the exact same Priest that attacked me before and I killed. Clearly a bunch of neckbeards defending M'ladies honor from being attacked.

So I followed them high up (They didn't notice me) for a bit wanting a little revenge, when she stopped to fight some quest mobs. I got above her, targetted her, dismounted, fell, then hit levitate and when in range, I fucking NUKED her with Shadow Word: Pain and she died instantly.

Before dying to a horde of level 85's I managed to type out /lol. They were camping the graveyards so I didn't bother to res and just stayed dead... About a minute later I get a RAGE FILLED message from that Priest who hopped on an Alliance character screaming about why she can't be left alone, and I was like ""You know that I'm the Mage you attacked and were killed by right?"". Her only response was ""FUCK YOU"" and she logged off.

Another minute later I received a whole SLEW of profanity laced threats and hate messages from that persons guildmates who said that I was harassing her and that they would report me, and find me IRL and shit.

I just ignored and reported their messages. I'm sure a few of them got banned because some of the shit they said was pretty graphic.

- Regular citizens (if you can call someone with the spare cash to throw at this ""regular"") have their hands on these in VERY large numbers. It's not that the supply is low, but rather that the AVAILABLE supply is low.
- $10K is pretty much the absolute bottom-end of the price range for full auto. $5000 will get you (MAYBE) a Sten or a MAC-10 in ok condition. Most transferable automatic weapons are in the $20-40K range. Then, as you said, the $200 tax stamp.
- No special permit is required. It's the same as any other NFA item, like a silencer or a short-barreled rifle. 
- If you're using a trust, no permission from your local chief law enforcement officer is necessary. When rule 41F goes into effect next month, nobody will need permission, as it will now be a notification to the CLEO only. This affects he fingerprinting as well, in that currently it's not needed for a trust, but will be under 41F.
- The background check is the same one you get for any other firearm. Nothing special about it (except you're waiting 5-6 months for the ATF examiner to run it).
- Absolutely nobody is watching, closely or otherwise, once you get your approved form back. The legal possession of a registered automatic firearm does not give the ATF (or anyone else) any special access to you.

"My freshman year of college, I was having problems with my best friend (we'll call her A) of ten years who had also gone to school with me. Long story short, we were not friends by the end of the year and she transferred to a school back home. Sometime during my sophomore year of college, I hear from another one of my best friends that A had run into other people from our high school, and when they asked why she transferred, she told them that I, along with my other roommates (one of whom she was very close with who I also disliked) had started doing heavy drugs and that she didn't want to be a part of that life. 

Also, when she went home at the end of freshman year, her mom put up a status on Facebook about how happy she was that her daughter was away from ""those bitches,"" and her mom's friend (who also happened to work at the place I worked as a counselor for a number of years) threatened to beat them (aka those bitches aka me) up."

I posted this on another comment, but I'll repost it here.

The conclusion of Arya's Braavos storyline is the Game of Thrones equivalent of Valve announcing ""We can count to three!"" and then going to the press conference to be greeted with the news that they're releasing a Half-Life 1, Portal 1, Left4Dead 1 combo disk. 

And on top of that... the conclusion to that storyline was just plain bad writing. 

Not to mention the fact that the whole Riverrun/Tully/Blackfish thing was just... a total and complete letdown. Blackfish's role was little more than a cameo. "

If you replace that with water I'm sure your weight loss will be pretty damn noticeable. Plus assuming you're drinking caffeinated soda, you should end up way more hydrated, which will make you feel loads better too. I'd say give it a shot for a few weeks and see how you feel. "

"The male urethra is about 8 inches long and goes through the prostate gland, while the female urethra is only about 2 inches long. The tendency to dribble can be more easily managed with the increased resistance that comes with the longer plumbing.

"Probably not scar tissue inside the vaginal canal, but most likely due to the shape of the cervix changing. The cerivcal opening, known as the Os, is donut shaped and tight before childbirth, and becomes stretched and more oblong-shaped after birth.

I eventually had to restrain her (I'm a hell of a lot bigger than her so it's quiet easy). I'd let her up, then she'd do it again. Rinse and repeat. Eventually (after a good half an hour of it) I had had enough and told her to get the fuck out the hotel. Grabbed all her shit and tossed it out the door, then pushed her out. After 10 secs she was still there and I felt terrible so I let her back in and she behaved and apologised.

"One of the problems you run into when trying to become a merchant in Eve is that your buy orders will tie up all your liquid assets, so you have to have a ridiculous amount of starting capital in order to get established on the market. The Margin Trading skill lets you mitigate that somewhat. The time limit on buy / sell orders is 90 days, and the assumption is that you will have the money to cover your attempted purchases by the time they are all used.

For example, if I know that a particular item commonly drops in a given region, I might want to set up a 90 day buy order for thousands of them. As I acquire those items, I can sell them in a different region at a profit. The Margin Trading skill allows me to post a buy order that will cover my expected need for that item without having to front the liquid cash for the entire 90 day period. This allows me to use my remaining cash to place buy orders for other items I expect to be profitable, which in the end allows me to make enough money to pay for each order as its made. It's essentially a form of credit, a way to borrow money, which is the beating heart of all profitable investment."

If you fall down and graze your knee then you should have been more careful, should have looked where you were going, shouldn't have been running so fast.

If you are ""being silly"" and break something or hurt yourself then you were being disobedient and should have taken more care.

""Accidents happen"" was not something my parents believed. All accidents can be avoided by being careful and following their (insanely strict) rules to the letter.

Have you ever met someone who has never, ever had to go to the emergency room? I never have. I'm in the UK, free healthcare, so it's not like they were avoiding costs. I just never had an accident that required medical attention beyond a broke nose (bullying, unsurprisingly).

It took me *years* to learn how to laugh at myself because 'making a mistake' was a really serious problem and I had to be ready to defend myself and punish myself appropriately."

Bonus if he wants to take the more active role while I work.  "
"Abloy is my favorite company brand name. It's an acronym for ""AB Lukko OY"". 

""Lukko"" means ""lock"" in Finnish.

""AB"" is a Swedish abbreviation of [aktiebolag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiebolag), meaning an incorporated company.

""Oy"" is a Finnish abbreviation of [osakeyhtiö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osakeyhti%C3%B6), which means the same thing, an incorporated company.

Abloy means ""Incorporated Lock Inc.""

Reddit's response ""quit being her cuck slave.""

What you're suggesting is really a return in attitude, in my experience, to when all of my relationships have had the most frequent sex. Women don't seem to respond well to masturbatory, romanceless, ""do me because I need to drain my balls in a woman"" sex. It would be easier if they did but that's just how it goes. You've got to do nice things and stoke the fires of passion a bit, just like you used to before you settled in with each other."

"This by far is the most frustrating part. I was grounded for TWO YEARS when I got caught with a single beer bottle in my room at 16. I had my door taken off the hinges, car privileges revoked for nearly a year unless it was to school or Boy Scout events,  had my room stripped and searched for more ""illegal"" things, etc. If I came back even a minute after curfew my license was completely taken for a week. If I wanted to go on a date with my girlfriend I had to ask 2 weeks in advance. For the sports I did sometimes my friends would grab food afterwards and invite me, but I could never go because I had to come straight home after school. I wasn't allowed a summer job as a teen because she didn't think I needed money, (read: Wanted me to depend on her giving me money to do things so she could control what I did.)

My 2 years younger little brother? Routinely out past midnight on school nights. Had a party when my mom was gone and one of his friends left a condom IN MY MOTHER'S BED. Was caught drinking I believe twice. We got drunk at my cousins rehearsal dinner  for his wedding and when we went back to the hotel I took care of him while he puked his guts out, made him take a shower and put him to bed. My mom was in the hotel room laughing about what a crazy kid he was. No punishment for any of these beyond a bit of yelling. He's getting a job at a music store this summer. The fuck is this mom?

 I don't want her to treat him the way she treated me because it's not like it's his fault she was bitchy, plus an eye for an eye and all that, but seriously. I got held to such high standards while he pretty much did his thing without being questioned. Super frustrating. "

I read a statistic that said 96% of all shootings involving concealed carry holders were not justified and even some concealed carry ""good guys with guns"" when they got the gun and the license turned out to be mass shooters and killed multiple people with the gun that was meant to protect those same people against mass shooters.

In my (and many other states), anyone can carry their gun on their hip or slung across their back in public. You don't need any training at all or even know how to load the gun. You just need the money to buy it and a belt to wear it. If you buy it on the private seller's market, you don't even need an ID to get it."

"They weren't outlawed. They just got rid of semi-automatic weapons. This is the US's major problem.

"And on the flip side, I simply don’t understand why some people think guns are so weird. Well, maybe some guns seem weird. I grew up in a rural household and my dad kept his rifle on the kitchen counter for about a decade plus so that he could shoot the starlings (invasive species) that were trying to make nests in his bluebird boxes and the foxes that ate our chickens. He told us kids not to touch the gun unless he asked us to hand it to him and he taught us gun safety and gave us some basic lessons in target practice. We literally never gave it a second thought and I distinctly remember thinking, at about the age of 8, “if a kid is *stupid* enough to mess around with his dad’s gun after being told how dangerous they are, then he is so stupid I wouldn’t miss him much.” Which is wayyyy too harsh, looking back, but kind of shows my perspective. Like, if a kid jumps off a cliff to see what would happen, would you blame the cliff or the kid? Baby me would have blamed the kid.    

  Growing up, my parents told me about how kids would leave rifles in their cars to go hunting after school, and I still knew a few kids who left guns in their car. Our closest family friends gave their kids small rifles to go deer and fox hunting when they were old enough, around 11-12. 

  Everyone is really careful. I have NEVER felt afraid of a gun. It never seemed like something made to kill people, more something to keep your chickens safe. (My family also has only locked our doors when we go on vacation, so we likely have a bit of a different environment than many redditors.) 

  Guns aren’t tied to our sense of identity but they are incredibly useful tools. I never thought about how it might seem to someone else until we had a Spanish exchange student who acted like we were a bunch of crazy people, plus reddit. It’s definitely eye opening to see how people react to them. I personally think that guns in the city and guns in the country are such different beasts that they’re basically opposites. In the city, you kill people with guns. In the country, you save things with guns. 

  At least, that has been my experience thus far.

"This might not meet the criteria, but I'll share anyways. I had a friend who would invite large groups of people over to his house for birthday parties. I think the first year there were 12 of us at his party. We got to his house at around 6pm on a Friday night and they did not have anything for us to eat for dinner. They definitely weren't poor either.. They had a large ranch and a beautiful home. So we all went to bed without eating (the birthday boy ate before we got there). Then his mom said we all had to be out of the house by 7am the following morning. We were all bummed so we stayed up all night, except for the birthday boy. Sure enough, the mom had us awake at 7am. We all left with no breakfast.

He invited me the following year for his birthday and I accepted. There were only 4 of us this time, but still no dinner or anything. I got hungry and asked if I could make a peanut butter sandwich, he said fine. I came back downstairs with 2 sandwiches and he freaked out. I was starving. We had to leave by 7am the next morning again too.

"Coming from the conservative south, I understand her mindset only because it was pounded into my brain since I hit puberty. ""If he loves you, he'll wait."" ""Love isn't about sex."" ""Sex can hurt you and cause a lot of problems. If he loved you he wouldn't want to do that to you."" A lot of the things we're told can be very damaging to our sex drives. Personally, I'm JUST getting to a place where I feel that I can initiate sex. I have always felt that if I showed that I wanted it, my boyfriend would be disgusted with me (not true at all). It takes a bit of growing up to realize that every person and relationship is unique and you dont necessarily have to base yours on what you were told during adolescense. "

About half way through the exam the teacher approached me and asked if everything was okay which I replied:
""Yes, I just don't want to do this exam.""
Teacher: ""If you fail you will bring the whole classes score down.""

It was in this moment I knew I no longer gave a single fuck and rested my head on back the table for the remainder of the exam. As you could guess I got a straight up zero on the exam and a stern talking to by all my teachers. If I had the moment again I would do the exact same thing."

"Pretty sure the caveat to this is that gay individuals are pretty much FORCED to be Trans, otherwise they will be punished for homosexuality, which, in Iran can cost you your life.

Also, if they don't transition but continue to do homosexual acts they will be punished, which, in Iran can literally cost you your life.

"From an early age (6 or 7 I guess) I wanted to be a pilot. Being from a family that at best had a modest income, being a private pilot was out of the question. But I was always mesmerized watching planes fly over and such. I was a mediocre high school student at best and only excelled in Carpentry and Band, neither were a good career opportunity in the early 1980's. At 26 I joined the Army as a mechanic and did pretty well. Due to prior service in the National Guard I made Sergeant in about a year, and had the opportunity to apply for the Army Initial Entry Rotary Wing Aviator Course (IERWAC). In English that is Army Helicopter Flight School. I figured the odds were pretty slim (I was stationed in Alaska, and it being considered an overseas assignment made getting selected for a resident school in the lower 48 very unlikely.) Add to that I was almost too old and only had one opportunity to get selected before I aged out of eligibility. But my wife told me to go for it and I took all the required exams, and passed, which was kinda a surprise. Then the dreaded Class 1 flight physical which excludes about 50% of all applicants, (I had to take 2 because the Army lost the 1st one), and again I was surprised I passed. 

Low and behold, I got notification I was selected by the selection board and received orders to Ft Rucker, AL home of Army aviation. I arrived at flight school only to learn the 1st thing you get to do is take another Class 1 Flight Physical, as Ft Rucker doesn't believe that anyplace else can do them correctly. Trouble this time as I get put on Medical hold due to a blood and urine tests both high on Calcium. They wanted to know why. 5 months later, I have surgery to have a Parathyroid tumor removed from my neck. Talk about lucky, I'm you guy. Seems than untreated, in about 6 more months, I would have been permanently disabled from bone damage, that wold have been irreversible. But mine was caught in time, and the surgery went without a hitch. 90 days later, I'm declared healthy and sent back to the flight surgeon for medical clearance to fly.  Whoops, it has been too long since they started that 3rd Class I flight physical, we have to start over.  UGH! another 2 weeks go by, and VIOLA! Finally, after over a year waiting to start pilot training, I get my chance, medical clearance to fly (An UP SLIP). 

Now I've been at Ft Rucker a year, and I've learned a lot. A lot of people start flight training, less than half complete.  There is the constant fear of washing out. Physically, Academically or you just plain suck as a pilot. I'd pretty much cleared the physical part and I'd learned some hard stuff like how to hover, and was doing OK in academics when I got a call to report to the hospital. Seemed my flight surgeon had overlooked a one sentence section of the Class I Physical regulation that noted: ""Any history of an Endocrine disorder is Class I medically disqualifying."" Seems I was being medically disqualified (DQ'd) due to my Parathyroid tumor.  I just about walk out of the office when the clerk mentioned ""It is too bad you haven't flown yet."" This prompted an excited conversation as I had amassed a whopping 12 hours of flight time and a quick consultation of the medical review board, and again I was back in training because once you take off in an aircraft for the 1st time, even in training, you no longer have to pass Class I Physical requirements, only Class II, and my medical history was waiver-able. (Whew, another close call).

Only 1 more real hurdle I had to overcome and that was Instrument Flight training. I'd handled visual flight training pretty handily but Instruments turned out to be the monkey on my back. Things were also complicated by my having been at flight school soooo long now that I'd managed to add a 3rd son to the litter, and having an infant and 2 in elementary school did not make for a great study environment. Add that the procedures for instrument flight are complicated at best and the result was my instrument instructor gave me a dreaded ""Pink Slip"" which required me to be evaluated by the company commander to see if I should be retained or given the boot. He passed  the decision to the Battalion commander, and I figured I was really finally screwed. But, as it turned out, when I reported to Battalion headquarters, the assistant operations officer inquired what was going on. We had a very long discussion, talked about what i should to to address the issues I was having and then he talked to the Battalion Commander, who surprisingly decided to give me another chance. I took the advise I was given and managed to become a passable instrument pilot.

Sooo, it took about 20 years, and a lot of luck, but at age 30 I became a Army Helicopter pilot and fulfilled a childhood dream."

"This is bad advice. I have a lot of attractive friends of the opposite sex, but after learning my lesson more than a few times, I have adopted a 'DO NOT SLEEP WITH YOUR FRIENDS' policy. 

Sure, there are maybe one or two of your friends who you could sleep with and maintain a platonic relationship with. but for the vast majority of friendships, sleeping together will either ruin things, make group situations uncomfortable once someone else finds out, or one of you will want to become more than just friends. If the latter is your goal to begin with, tell them before you start hooking up with them.

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish the difference between loving a person platonically, and being sexually or romantically interested in a person. especially if you spend a lot of time together, travel together, or drink a lot together. 

Most of the time, it's not worth ruining or complicating a friendship over, especially if you have been friends for a long period of time. "

When the cop asked for mine, I told him I didn't have it, but really brother had mine and when he handed the ticket to me, the cop thought we were using one ticket for two people. He was writing the ticket arguing to us in Italian when I said to him in Spanish ""I'm Argentine, Diego Maradona, please""
For those who don't know, Maradona was a soccer player who played for Napoli and is regarded as a god there, his pictures are all over bars and meat shops.

"While vacationing in Hawaii, I decided to swim out to where the ocean floor dove into a sudden drop-off. It wasn't all that far from the shore, and I was more than a skilled enough swimmer to make it there and back with little difficulty.

As soon as I reached the undersea cliff, though, something happened. The water's temperature plummeted. The sounds of laughter from the beach became slowed and muffled, as though I was hearing them from beyond the veil of a nightmare. Each wave seemed to freeze in its flow, giving the ocean an eerie stillness... and the sky, which seconds before had been clear and sunny, suddenly adopted a colorless sheen of dull grey.

Something could see me.

Something could see me.

I didn't know what it was, nor how I could feel its presence; all I knew was that it was enormous, and that its attention was focused solely on the pathetic flailing of my limbs. Even without hearing it, I could sense the low rumble of its voice, chuckling at how utterly powerless I was.

In a panic, I swam back towards the shore... and as soon as I crossed the threshold that separated the shallows from the depths, everything reasserted itself. The beach was a happy haven for vacationers, the sun was shining in a cloudless sky, and the waves gently splashed against me with a soothing melody.

There have been times since that I've returned to deep bodies of water, and for the most part, I can manage to keep my head about me. Still, some part of my mind is perpetually aware of the lurking entity in the unknowable fathoms... always watching from behind and beneath.

TL;DR: Deep water makes me nervous.

"No, it just kind of highlights the exploitativeness of pornography.  People like to think that the basic premise of porn (Cock Hungry Teen in Miami takes it in all holes) is true, not (poor Eastern European Woman does degrading, painful things on camera for $40)

At least when the girls speak English you know they are from an English speaking country or in a position where they were taught more than one language, which implies some basic level of social access and agency.  Considering the prevalence of the sex trade in less developed parts of the world (where English is not commonly spoken/taught) it is hard to ignore the fact that what you are watching has a larger component of financial coercion (at the very least, if not something worse) than you'd like to think about while you try to blow your wad.

Hearing a pornstar who can't speak English talk is like eating at a steakhouse where they've got a window into the backroom where they murder the cows.  Ya, you're getting the same product, and you knew that is where it came from, but you want to ignore the unpleasant part.

"At the height of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, the military junta under MacArthur actually drafted a contingency plan if things had gone out of hand, called ""Final Solution To The Revolter Question"". Basically, to avoid a Third American Civil War and challenging the immensely popular John Kennedy, the junta had plans to basically create a right-wing version of Totalist Britain and practically round up anyone even remotely related to the protesters.

Fortunately, the regime fell before any such things could have taken place and democracy was re-established, but to think that the idea of a totalitarian America *actually existed* just screams ""what the hell?"" to me. It's implementation is actually one of my favorite alternate history scenarios, too - next to Entente winning World War I, of course."

"It was really weird. Sara just wanted me to stay. It never occurred to her that her family was a little off, but so is the case with most living within these families. In terms of the parents, I don't know how they acted. I just hid in the basement with Sara for a bit, I don't remember the exact reason but my parents taking me home was not an option that night. So I pulled out my LG Rumor, fumbled with it for a sec and made up an excuse of why I had to leave immediately. Trust me it was not smooth and really awkward. Sara knew something was up but I just bailed as soon as I could. Usually I'm good at lying, but this was a fumbled mess of an excuse."

"Oh man, when I was a student I took a class entitled something like ""The Psychology of Sleep"".

Or the recommended previous courses of ""Brain and Behavior"", ""Intro to Neurology"", and one other neuroscience course i forget the name of.

"While picking my daughter up from grade school.

She did and the poor guy backed down and moved his car."

"My wife gave me a threesome with her best friend for a Christmas present one year. We had discussed fantasies, and being with two women was mine. She was also curious, and shocked the hell out of me by arranging it. It was incredibly hot. In addition, my wife discovered that she really likes seeing me with other women. We have continued, on occasion, to invite her to play with us. We also have a similar relationship with one of my friends[f]. Neither of them live close by, so it tends to be a special occasion when it does happen.

We established ground rules up front. We chose people that we trust implicitly. None of us have broken the rules, and we have been able to grow and explore and enjoy each others' company. If anything, it has made our friendships stronger.

It's not for everybody. Some people can't get over the mental, emotional, and social stigma of poly relationships, or even just the physical sex part of it. A lot of people do it wrong, or they break the rules, and it can be devastating to a relationship. Done right, with the right people, it can be a beautiful thing."

As I was raised Catholic I was never taught anything about what orgasms were, so I labored (no pun intended) under the delusion (for a few years) that every time I got the good feels it was simulating what birth/being pregnant felt like. 

I now can't even be attracted to people who aren't really pregnant and it's annoying as hell."

I understand how understanding everything about even your first ""program"" needs deeper exploration of the language because it all works together.

So what happens is that people think that ""Hey, if I can make something appear on the screen, I'm a programmer and learning the rest of programming should be a piece of cake!""

It isn't. Learning enough coding to actually make programs/apps/games worth playing is hard. It is a long road. Programming is a finicky beast, and each platform you code for has its own method if working, its own kinks, it's own libraries for getting things done.

I'm not trying to discourage anyone from coding. Rather  the opposite. Just understand it isn't as simple as people make it out to be, but here's the upside: it's therefore also much more rewarding than people make it out to be, too."

"Here's something few know about basic training: almost no group punishment is because ""someone screwed up"".  They just want you to think that.  Most punishment time is planned into the day's schedule in advance, and as the time draws near, they find someone to blame the punisment on - that's easy; someone will always screw up.  

Thing is, Basic is so regimented (pardon the pun). The troops have to be on time for every meal, every class, every range, every movement of transportation - punishment has to be put into the schedule where it'll fit.  And they always try to fill any free time, whether scheduled or unplanned.  Can't have troops sitting around shooting the shit; this is Basic Training!  If they don't have anything else for the unit to do, it'll be punishment.  So, they find someone who fucked up, scream at him, scream at everybody else, and punish them until that free time's gone.

"Similarly, I had a friend who was on birth control, always used condoms, and boyfriend pulled out most of the time because of how paranoid they were. She got pregnant once when he didn't pull out, condom broke, and she got pregnant. She didn't believe in abortion, and he'd been adopted and didn't want to give their baby up. Sometimes you can be incredibly safe, and still end up pregnant.

  What I found so enthralling about it was watching the protagonist lose everything and claw her way up the prison hierarchy. I dunno, I'm a huge sucker for a revenge plot.

"Upon playing the original games again, the only thing that had changed for me was which game I liked better. Growing up, I always loved Year of the Dragon the best, followed by 2 and then 1. I think it's because the last 2 games have more characters, more mini-levels inside each level, more things to keep a kid entertained.

But the first game is just raw platforming. When I finished replaying them I was able to appreciate how well the first game was actually designed. Some of the later levels are still pretty challenging, too (tree tops...). It's definitely my favourite of the 3, but I still love the others.

"It was apparently a very difficult day but our families did an amazing job of making sure things happened like they were supposed to. The night before my husband's best man and groomsman flaked out so he asked his dad and my brother which worked out well because we realized those two had a huge hand in making our relationship possible. My brothers and our fathers actually went above and beyond on making sure everything went great. We rented a part of a public park for our ceremony but it began at four and there was a fundraiser that was supposed to end at three at the other side of the park but you know how people are. Our male family members managed to explain to the people who stuck around that there was a wedding happening and they needed to scatter from that part of the park, clean up the mess from the funraiser, get everything set up, and get everyone seated by four. My brother realized there was drama brewing between two of the guests he invited so he convinced them to leave without making a scene. His girlfriend was supposed to bring the cake topper and sparkling juice for the toast but dropped the ball so hubby's grandma made an even prettier cake topper out of one of the extra bouquets and we toasted with some fizzy water my brother had in his car.

On my husband's and I side everything went very smooth (thanks to our amazing families) my sister even had the foresight to send my friend in where I was getting dressed to help with the ties on the dress and the veil. My brother and my sister were making faces to distract my husband and I during the officiant's speech because my poor intended looked ready to pass out. It was sweet, he was grinning the whole time hard enough that his cheeks started twitching.

All in all it was a great day that brought us and our families closer together, which I believe is a main point of a wedding."

"To be fair, and I say this as a two-time Obama voter, ""Change"" and ""Hope"" were demagoguery too.  Whenever you appeal to a voter's desires and emotions instead of reason, you're being a demagogue.

Some of these represent broken campaign promises, but most were just things he let voters believe he would do something about without actually promising to do so.  That ""fill in the blanks with your own projected desires"" thing is the same as what Trump is doing now."

But this is probably influenced by the high poverty rate. I would be curious what a poor white area is like. Our hispanic students however pretty much always have both parents in the home if not a grandparent or two... "

"Living in Japan and having little imagination, it would he a level 7 earthquake with Tsunami alert. Phones here have integrated alarm function, so it is kind of creepy. No matter whether your phone is silent mode or not, it will start screaming ; and you can usually listen your neighbours phones as well. Then, there is usually a 30sec - 1min gap before it starts (earthquakes are not predictable until last moment). For me, this gap is the scariest. I know it will start, but not how strong it will be. 
Once it starts, it feels like eternity. You never knowhow long it will be. You remember March 2011,and you wonder if you building is REALLY safe. You start to have thoughts about death."

"In my first year of university, I was coming from a small town so I didn't know anyone. During that first week, I met this girl. This girl and I didn't talk much until our third week through the semester when we started to hang out more, and the more I got to know her, the more I fell for her. It was complicated to date within our program, so I confided in a close friend I had met during the first week of school on how things were. This friend listened to me throughout the semester and even gives me advice and encouragement.

I finally made my move after a lot of flirting and getting close and the answer was no. Sucks but that's life, right?

A couple weeks after the rejection, I'm working in one of the classrooms with a buddy of mine and I tell him about how this girl rejected me and how much I liked her. His face visibly pales and he tells me that my friend, who I have been confiding in this entire time, had been fucking her behind my back about a week after he found out I liked her and refused to tell me, even when I straight up asked if he was interested in her as well.

There's nothing I can do to change that girl's mind, but the fact that someone so close to me, lied to my face for so long really fucked me up for the rest of that semester."

Couple that with the ownership blatantly opposing the SODO arena, and Mariners fans are just tired of it. With the upstairs changes we saw this season, things will likely get better."

A few days later, I get a MySpace message from her mom saying that there's messages I need to delete from previous relationships and whatnot if I want to be with her daughter... WTF?? (Pretty graphic messages for how young we were honestly)

 Apparently when I told the girl my login credentials, I was on speakerphone and her mom listened in stole my password. She logged into my myspace, stalked everything she could find, and then sent me a message instructing me on what I should delete as to not offend her daughter (as if that's something normal people to do) 

TL;DR Girls mom eavesdropped and stole my myspace password and stalked through all my shit.

"The mother being there doesn't necessarily imply that it's due to genetics, since she would have been a major factor shaping both of their environments as well. But it does suggest that it's a possibility and could be worth looking in to. And there is a distinction between being transgender and having gender dysphoria, you can be a trans person without dysphoria after you have transitioned, or if you weren't bothered by your mismatched parts. In that way transitioning is considered a treatment for the dysphoria, or negative feelings you have due to your gender identity not matching your body. But similarities in the brains of transgender people and the gender that they feel most similar to do exist. Again hard to say how much is nature vs nurture without more genetic research, as your environment can certainly affect your brain. As long as we can all agree that their value and rights as a person are in no way diminished, I don't think it's hurtful to ask questions and be curious about the topic."

"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In the books, Dumbledore is a calm and wise old man who exudes an aura of wisdom and power. He is a near God-like figure who is always ten steps ahead of the other characters and the audience. In this particular scene, Harry's name had come out of the Goblet of Fire, enlisting him (even though he was too young to enter) into a ""feats of strength"" type tournament. Harry didn't enter his name. This was a major problem because, A: Dumbledore had reason to suspect that this was related to a plot by Voldemort and, B: the other two schools participating in the tournament would view it as a ploy to get two Hogwarts champions into the tournament (the Goblet had already named a Hogwarts champion before Harry's name came out, and the tournament was only supposed to involve three champions, one from each school). This was a diplomatic nightmare.

So, in the scene, Dumbledore was supposed to approach Harry and calmly ask if he entered his name. In the movie, however, Dumbledore runs into the room in an angry panic, shoves Harry into a table and screams ""DIDYOUPUTYOURNAMEINTHEGOBLETOFFIRE!"", which essentially broke Dumbledore's character in the movies, because it was the exact opposite of what Dumbledore was supposed to be. The scene pissed a lot of fans off."

He probably doesn't enjoy his steak anymore either
"Honestly, I don't see real meat eating going away anytime soon. People just don't respect animal lives enough to inconvenience themselves. I'm not a tree-hugging hippie vegan protester, either. I love steak above all other food. But it does make me a hypocrite because I know that the steak I make and eat comes from cows raised and slaughtered in very unethical circumstances. Poultry/eggs are arguably even worse.

The real benefits here are that the massive quantities required for things like fast food and distributed processed meat products would completely disappear. Don't have to ship in a ton of butchered meat on a timescale? That's good. Jack Links makes the meat *and* the jerky from it in the same lab? Less production costs (potentially).

I don't have a problem *eating* meat, nor using prey animals as food. But freeing up most of the meat-driven food economy with a cheaper and ethical alternative means that the real meat is more expensive, and likely to be more humanely raised and treated.

Plus, it will become ""cool"" to raise cattle in good environments when the dollar sign can go up based on their treatment. Imagine all real meat being like Kobe beef from Japan"

"On taxes

&gt; Tax relief for middle class Americans: In order to achieve the American dream, let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages.

The amount of taxes reduced is minimal at best. for people under 25k/year (below the poverty line) it is reduced to zero IIRC. While this is good for them, the tax lift is minimal considering what was already being paid.

&gt; Simplify the tax code to reduce the headaches Americans face in preparing their taxes and let everyone keep more of their money.

Sounds like pretty words. *what will he do to simplify the code?* is the first thing that comes to mind. AFAIK, he has yet to elaborate upon that.

&gt; Grow the American economy by discouraging corporate inversions, adding a huge number of new jobs, and making America globally competitive again.

Again sounds good but where are these jobs coming from and how is he going to discourage corporate inversion? Is he going to seize the means of production and open worker co-ops? (socialism)

Or is he going to yell at them? (won't work)

&gt; Doesn’t add to our debt and deficit, which are already too large.

read this

http://crfb.org/papers/adding-donald-trumps-campaign-proposals-so-far

&gt; 2.All other Americans will get a simpler tax code with four brackets – 0%, 10%, 20% and 25% – instead of the current seven. This new tax code eliminates the marriage penalty and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II.

While it is the lowest since WWII, it was an increased tax on the rich that helped us through the depression (the war played a part not as large as you would think). He wants to bring our tax rate back to what it was *during* the depression?

I think it sounds nice but where will we get any of the money that we need to have for infrastructure or our current trade deficit? I've already submitted evidence that so far he is significantly *increasing* the debt.

He must be taxing the rich more right? Because now that's the only option, because we *need* the revenue to stay afloat.

&gt; No business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. This lower rate makes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America’s tax rate one of the best in the world.

"Not a baby as such but two stories from working up older children for kidney transplants when we were checking the matches for parents to donate the kidneys.

1) Working two kids up who also had older siblings with kidney problems. It quickly came back that the first kid's dad was not dad ... potentially tricky situation there. Then it came out second kid's dad wasn't dad ... oh what a week. Then we looked and we saw if you actually swapped the dads around then the things all matched. Hence a little chat and the idea that maybe both families would consider seeing if they would consider donating a kidney to another family if that family were to do the same to them. The mums saids this was a great idea and then a few days later we informed them - hey folks, you're just not going to believe your luck.

2) A young lady who had come into the country for treatment along with her mum and dad. We tested dad first and the result was that he obviously wasn't dad. He explained this was his chance to get into the country and away from his old life. So we shrugged and tested mum. Turns out it wasn't mum but aunt. Now they didn't meltdown but I can tell you social services did once it became apparent they had cheated their way into the system. The irony being that even though they weren't her biological parents they cared for her immaculately."

"Had a roommate when I was younger that the rest of us hated. There were five of us altogether in a tiny little house in Ann Arbor, MI. and he was ""that one guy."" Ate other people's food. Dirtied dishes but refused to ever wash them or even acknowledge that he was the one who used them. Chronically behind on his portion of the rent. That guy.

Needless to say, since we were all incredibly youngish (late teens to early twenties) we got up to all sorts of shenanigans just as a general rule. The inevitable result of this practical joke war of attrition was that we eventually reached a point where all of us had inner and outer locks on our bedroom doors. It was simply a matter of self preservation by that point. If you wanted peace, you kept your door locked. Period.

Well, we hated this guy. And the house was old; wood floors, largish gaps beneath the doors. So we came up with the mother of mind-fuckery pranks to pull. We piss-pucked him.

Piss-pucking works thusly:

* piss in a disposable plastic or styrofoam cup. Just a little bit, about an inch and a half or so.
* freeze said cup overnight in the freezer.
* cut or tear away the cup from your now frozen hockey puck of urine.
* slide the piss puck under the victim's door as hard as you can.
* wait for the laws of thermodynamics to work.
* enjoy the deliciously sweet howls of rage and confusion that ensue when your roommate returns home to find an inexplicable puddle of piss in the middle of his room.

We did this about 4-5 times a week for months and we very nearly drove him insane. He must have changed the lock on his door about a good 25-30 times, convinced that one of us must have somehow gotten a hold of a copy of his key. He added multiple padlocks. He even went so far as to buy a web cam, but this was back in the day when storing continuous video on a personal PC was unrealistic so it simply took a photo every 10 seconds or so. The best part was that he had it aimed at the door, not the floor, so it didn't impact our piss-pucking activities at all and simple served to drive him further down the spiral of insanity.

We were relentless. We would even, on occasion, send one through in the middle of the night so he would wake up to a fresh puddle of piss first thing in the morning, locked securely inside his vault. Looking back, I think that was the first time I actually saw someone start to go literally off the deep end. We may have pushed things a bit too far. His eyes adopted this wide frantic look at all times. He stopped showering regularly. His conversation became abrupt and stilted.

Eventually he moved away after he found a job in New Mexico. And, as far as I know, none of us ever broke the code of silence to reveal the truth to him. Part of me hopes he sees this and realizes that he wasn't going crazy, we were just fucking with him. Really he wasn't that bad of a roommate, to be fair. He was just the worst one in our group, and that painted a target on his back. So, wherever you may be, D.M., I am truly sorry. We were assholes."

If you as a parent are self aware, it won't happen. You just got to realize that the main point of a kid playing sports is for them to feel better about themselves and to burn off excess energy. Winning is not the goal. If you are like my dad, where your goal is to mold your child into a famous [insert sport here] player, You and your kid will end up hating each other. By all means practice with your kid. It is a great way to bond, but you do not need at age 7 to stay two hours after every practice with your son or daughter teaching them ""things they will need in the future"". If there was some way I had been able tell my dad that I enjoyed playing with him, but did not enjoy his forceful teaching methods my sports career would have been so much better."

They were always called out for being mean and didn't last on the show. They weren't mean, they told it like it was. 

Another thing is the back stories, the way the show is edited, music etc. God damn we get one act per commercial practically and we already know if the act is going through or not by the way it's been edited.

"From Genius: ""This song shows a man facing the truth about a relationship that he is in with a woman whom he no longer loves, and the feeling (or lack thereof) is mutual. However, neither of them can accept that they want to leave each other, despite the fact that neither of them are happy

…or do let the upbeat melody deceive you. After all, the song is about disingenuous surface level happiness.""

"Been a daycare worker for 8 years and there are a few things that I can tell the parents are bad at parenting. The biggest factor is kids who don't know how to handle being told no, or kids who fight for attention. 

Example. I had a child who was the most violent kid I've ever encountered. I hate saying kids are violent, because most of the time they act out because they don't know how to express themselves. This kid though would wait till me or the other teacher were both doing something with another child. Like diaper changes or nap time. The child would punch the other kid to the ground sit on their chest and rip their hair out in chunks. The child would regularly draw blood, and no matter how close an eye we kept on the child they would act out the second we turned our back.

We brought it up to the parents and they either blamed us or insisted that their child didn't have a problem. 

The issue got so bad that they were told that one more act of violence from this child and they would be kicked out. The parents retaliated by filing a false claim of child abuse against me. They even went to the extent of painting on bruises around their child't sexual organs and took the child to 4 hospitals until they got CPS to take their case. 

These parents were so in denial about their kids behavior that they would ignore everything the child did. I ran into the mom a year later (after the case was dropped and the daycare sued them for a false claim) and she vented to me that her child has been kicked out of 4 more daycares, and she still thinks that its the daycares causing the child to act out.

"There's a few aspects of this that I'm not sure if women really understand.

If our first message isn't terribly creative or interesting, that's because the response rate to a first message is like 5% if you're lucky, no matter what kind of message it is. Writing witty, creative messages tailored to your profile takes time, and we don't much care to spend that time when 95% of them will never get a reply. If you're interested too, then write back, and the next message will be more personal. If you're not, then ignore it or whatever. Either way, don't bother getting all offended that the first message is a generic copy-paste, it's just the way the game works.

Of course, this is more of a problem on platforms like Match and OKCupid where you can message anybody anytime. This is why I kind of prefer Tinder, even if it has a reputation for hook-ups. I can't even send you a message unless you already swiped right on me, and women know it, so I'm not wasting time sending messages to women who would never be interested in me, and you aren't getting bombarded by messages from a kazillion men you have no interest in. And women have an incentive to swipe right on a reasonable but not overwhelming amount of men. I've generally gotten much better response rates on Tinder."

"Technically if you have the right license you can own anything. The majority of these 'scary' guns people talk about, like AR15's or semi-automatics are in category D for every state. It is possible, but incredibly hard to get licensed for category D if you have an appropriate reason. However, this varies from state to state. For example, this is how [Queensland categorises firearms](https://www.police.qld.gov.au/programs/weaponsLicensing/licenceApplication/weapons/categories/). Personally I would like semi-auto rifles to be opened up to hunters again, instead of just professional shooters as it would help the fight against feral animals tremendously. The damage they do to agriculture and native wildlife is huge, and it's a shame more people don't realise it. "

"It's one thing to say that a joke hurts you because it hits home for you in a way that brings back bad memories or personal struggles. It's another to try and dictate what everyone else is allowed to find funny, and making definitive statements like ""rape is never funny,"" because it shows that you (greater you, not direct you) don't have enough social awareness to realize that people around you have different senses of humor and deal with these jokes differently than you. Even people who *have* been through traumatic events sometimes use humor to deal with them, and comedians especially should not be attacked or made to apologise for a joke they made, even if to you, it isn't funny. This is particularly true when the comedian has a large audience of people who clearly do find it funny.

I think that's where people like myself get aggrevated with the ""tragedy isn't funny"" crowd. I think its funny, and the comedian thought it was, and the crowd he appeals to is full of people who think it is - who are they to tell us what we are and aren't allowed to laugh at? Why does their personal disdain for a type of humor dictate what I'm allowed to say and listen to? It's like when people started trying to force Daniel Tosh to apologise for his rape joke... It's fine to not think it's funny - hell, it's fine to be offended. But when you tell someone that they need to cater their act to your sense of humor and your comedic standards or face a shitstorm, I have an issue with that. "

* Watching [""Wrestling Isn't Wrestling""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYvMOf3hsGA) and learning to appreciate the long term creative aspect of wrestling.
* Learning that WWE is starting to take Women's wrestling more seriously. I watched Sasha Banks vs. Bayley at Brooklyn after not watching wrestling for 10+ years and loved it. Great match and got me hooked back into wrestling."

"Tamba Bay (blue guys) are using 1-3-1 ""trap"" defense. So you have 1 guy near your own goal, 3 guys on the middle red line, and 1 at the opponent's blue line (see 1:00 in the video). Basically, it makes it very hard to get past them without losing the puck as they are blocking most passing lanes. This is why players often shoot the puck in to the opponent's end and just skate after it (aka dump-and-chase).

Philly players are mocking the Tamba players, calling them cowards etc. for utilizing the trap system. It's not like it's impossible to penetrate the defense, it's just annoying and makes for boring hockey, as evidenced in the video."

[In the 1970s, Sony developed the Betamax video tape recording format. Universal Studios and the Walt Disney Company were among the film industry members who were wary of this development, but were also aware the U.S. Congress was in the final stages of a major revision of copyright law and would likely be hesitant to undertake any new protections for the film industry. The companies therefore opted to sue Sony and its distributors in California District Court in 1976, alleging that because Sony was manufacturing a device that could be used for copyright infringement, they were thus liable for any infringement committed by its purchasers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Corp._of_America_v._Universal_City_Studios,_Inc.)

[Two years later, the District Court ruled for Sony, on the basis that noncommercial home use recording was considered fair use, that access to free public information is a First Amendment public interest served by this use. However, this ruling was reversed in part by the Ninth Circuit Court, which held Sony liable for contributory infringement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Corp._of_America_v._Universal_City_Studios,_Inc.)

"Used an old hack of World of Warcraft Guild forms to get peoples password to that website. They often used the same password for their email. Then you recovered their WoW account.

Once you had the account the fun started. You'd log in and start advertising you had the WoW trading card game Spectral Tiger card, which you could use to get an in game mount. So people would start chatting you. You'd get 3-7 different chats going, convince the buyer to pay you half before the trade, then you'd work the rest of the crowd while telling anyone who's already paid you half, you were taking a photo. Stall like hell to make some other trades.

If you got lucky, the account you logged into had a few tens of thousands of gold (one account had 250k). Once people found out you were a fraud, you'd sell all the equipment and crap the account had for the extra gold. Go to a Chinese gold buying website and sell it off at $5-6/1000 gold.

"Wouldn't one argue that journalism would be the field that contains this expertise though? It's his job to find a topic like this, do the research on said topic using interviews and cases from people involved in the topic (i.e. A lawyer talking about the case) and then presenting it to the public at large. Some people use the newspaper to produce their findings, others use blogs/websites, John Oliver uses television. If we, the public at large, want more information, we know where and how to find more from John Oliver's segment regardless of if we agree with him.

If anything your comparison with Donald Trump is more telling of your personal opinion of John Oliver himself rather than his legitimacy, since it is Trump's job right now to gather facts on things like global warming, form an opinion, and share it with the country. That is, in essence, his expertise."

What the fuck fucking fuck good is that? The mnemonic is pointless when the names of different months can fit into the same meter. The only way to even remember the poem at all is to memorize the exact thing that the mnemonic was supposed to help you memorize.

Don't let all the temptations of freshman year and the like tear you away from who your friends know you to be.

"The Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) still pisses me off to no end. Literally everybody praising the ACA for ""giving everyone access to healthcare"" has no fucking clue what they're talking about.

""Access"" has never been the real problem. If somebody didn't have access, it was because it was too expensive. The problem is that **the cost of healthcare is ludicrously higher in America than anywhere else, and the ACA did *fuck all* to actually address any of the root causes of the problem.**

A huge part of the fundamental issue with American healthcare is our fucked up health insurance system. It's not the only factor, but it's one of the biggest. There's absolutely *no legitimate reason* why it should be the norm for employers to provide health insurance. It makes the market needlessly rigid, prevents adequate price signalling, and generally makes it difficult for the proper market forces to control price. It makes no fucking sense! The only reason it works like this at all is because its a holdover from WWII, when employers had caps on what they could pay workers, so they started compensating with benefits instead.

Worse, it's not even ""insurance"" anymore. Insurance is supposed to be a hedge bet against an unlikely but catastrophic event. The entire concept of insurance is based on a paradigm of ""you'll probably never need it, but you'd better have it just in case."" Meanwhile, health ""insurance"" has essentially become a subscription service that allows you access to routine shit like checkups and prescriptions. There's no reason why access to basic and predictable goods and services needs to be controlled by a fucking ""network of providers."" Imagine if you had to pay a monthly fee just to have the *right* to walk into your local grocery store and buy your essentials.

Then there's the enormous disconnect between the people who receive the care (the patients), and the people who pay the bill (the insurers). Seriously, the next time that you go into a doctor's office or hospital, ask them how much a certain procedure will cost. They'll probably look at you like you've got lobsters crawling out of your ears, because virtually *nobody* asks this question. Why? Because hardly nobody with insurance actually has to think about it! That x-ray could cost $10 or $10,000, but you don't care, because *you're not footing the bill.* At least, not right now; that cost will be broken up and shared by everybody else who's paying a premium. So what's to stop doctors from just jacking up their prices? Yeah, the insurance companies will haggle with them, but there's clearly a different price-setting dynamic here than in, say, the market for automobiles. 

So we've got this obviously-broken system, and what does the ACA do? Did it fix the underlying problems of the American healthcare system? Did it try to control these prices, prevent price gouging, or reduce unnecessary procedures? No! It didn't fix shit! In fact, it did the complete opposite! It reinforced our nonsensical employer-provided-insurance arrangement by strong-arming everybody into buying into it! 

Tell me, has healthcare become more ""affordable"" since the ACA went into effect? Have our insurance premiums dropped? Have our copays? I have insurance, yet I'm still paying $120 a month for a medication that's been around since before 1940. Dollar for dollar, we're still paying way more money than any other country for the exact same level of care. **Nothing has been fucking fixed.**

"The announcer in this video (Jon Gruden) is fucking famous for having a comedic awareness of this particularly absurd playname, Spider 2 Y Banana. 

* Spider means ""slide protection"" where the line of big men try to protect their quarterback
* 2 is short-hand for ""play-action"" which means the quarterback will fake handing the ball to someone else, and then try to throw it, hoping the defense thinks the runner has the ball. This should give the QB a few extra seconds to throw it to someone before the defense figures out what happened
* Y Banana means the player in the Y position runs a long slant out down the field. If he doesn't get the ball, then he can start blocking and chucking enemy players and build space in enemy territory for the real ball carrier to get distance downfield. On the other hand, if he does get the ball (as in the Saints play) then it's a big yardage gain because he's probably far beyond the target line for first down, which is a major goal of every pass play in football.

You are starting from the assumption that someone who is contemplating mass murder is thinking rationally.

Simply put, we do not yet know **what** his motivation was for this shooting. There is far too much speculation at this point. It could have been Extremist-Islamic belief related, or it could have been severe homophobic rage, which isn't 'terrorism', it's a hate crime.

Please don't attempt to change my above statement."
"* Their child is there all day (6 AM- 6 PM), everyday that we're open. It doesn't bother me at all if the parent(s) are actually working, I get it! But it hurts my heart to watch a child have to watch other kids get picked up by excited parents, and then to be greeted by their own parent (in work out clothes/pajamas) who is genuinely annoyed to have to disrupt their day to pick up and hang out with their kid. 

* Dirty kids. Child getting dropped off wearing a diaper that they clearly had been wearing all night (you can tell...it smells just dirty). Getting dropped off w/ boogers crusted over their nostrils (as soon as the parent leaves I de-crust it with a wet wipe, and the kid usually screams because it probably hurts). I've had a kid get dropped off wearing the same outfit as the day before. And lastly, when a kid has BO. A 3 yr old shouldn't have BO, but it's understandable when the kid's hair is so greasy it's probably been 4 days since a bath. 

* I'm torn on temper tantrums because kids are manipulative little shits and parents are in over their heads. I'm used to kids throwing fits (crying) and it's whatever, their bodies are too small to hold all their emotions. **But** it's clear that a kid has bad parents when they go berserk and physically attack other children or adults out of anger. Not okay. 

* Their kid is always sick. Literally every child who starts at a center will go through a phase of being sick because they're exposed to new germs. We keep the center as clean as possible, but kids are literally always coughing/sneezing/or sucking on something. I hate when parents bring in their kid doped up on tylenol, it's so obvious when they're fine all day and then they wake up from nap and are crabby and burning up. Or parents who don't respect the 24 hour no fever (and barf) policy. I once had a child throw up an exorcist amount, and she was picked up around 10:30 AM. The next morning mom comes in and tries to drop off her kid at 8 AM and we awkwardly have to tell her no and she tries to excuse it by saying the kids dad accidentally gave her double the dosage of some medicine (that's concerning) that caused her to throw up. We tell her ""Well, we can't be sure of that so you'll have to take her home for the good of your own child and the others"" and she literally says ""But I have a meeting""...and we just said ""sorry...?"" Those parents also once brought in their kid the day after we sent her home for suspected pink eye and the dad said ""The doctors tested her for pink eye and she doesn't have it"" There is no test for pink eye. (Sorry to get all worked up about illnesses, it's so annoying when a parent drops off their kid and subjects not only the other children, but also me and the other staff to their kids germs. And on top of that, the kid is miserable)

I've worked at a daycare for nearly 4 years and it's awesome. The worst part of the job isn't the tantrums, accidents, throw up, but it's the parents. Don't even get me started on helicopter parents who throw a huge fit about everything and make our lives hell.

"You could answer this whole thread just talking about the names of climbs.

I've had people ask if the crash pad is a massage table, a raft, a card table, if i'm going ""mountain climbing"" (highest elevation here is 800 feet), and ""when will you climb in yosemite like alex honnold?"". 

a couple years ago i spent goodly amounts of time on a local boulder problem called Babies With Rabies. I would get weird looks discussing it on my cell phone in public, so I shortened it to just ""Babies"" which if anything made it worse ""yeah man i ripped my tip off on babies this morning"" theres nothing about that sentence that's ok. there's another one down the way called ""Monkey Butt-Love"" which just can't be discussed, really. 

""jabba da hut"" is a local climb near me, and the shit climb around the corner is called ""pizza da hut"". My favorite tho goes to a couple climbs at the gunks. There is the infamous ""Dismantle"", normal sounding name, and some smart-alek named a nearby climb ""dat-mantle"". I fucking love climbers."

"And this is the exact reasoning these manipulative people use.

Lie to him, get him on the hook, force him to raise a child that isn't his for several years... and then he's invested in the child so he will keep supporting you as long as you want.  All this time, you know the child isn't his, but you don't tell him because he's paying the bills, and you're comfortable.

Oh, of course, until you decide you don't want him in your life anymore, THEN you pull the paternity card and use it to remove him from the child's life.

There is a lot of pain in this situation, and it is caused by the mother lying.  The guilt and blame should be entirely on her.  If she is using paternity as a tool to keep him from her child's life, then the mother obviously does not care about the child's happiness.

"It saved my ass in college during freshman year. It was nearing finals week so it was crunch time, made worse by me taking classes beyond what the freshman would normally take since I came into college with credits for a lot of the core classes. One of the assignments I was struggling on so I turned to google for help. Well, it was my lucky day. I found the entire assignment on another website. In my stressed and tired state I copied and pasted, changed up parts of the first couple answers but forgot to change the rest once the due time rolled around (online assignment). No matter I thought, I knew she didn't use a checker for plagiarism. I didn't like that I did it it but I wasn't too worried. Luck decided to take a shit on me this time and this assignment was the one time she used one. I thought my ass was fucked. She gave no leniency to one guy who missed the due date by two minutes earlier in the year, she was one of the professors in a program that I had to apply to get into. She calls me in to her office and confronts me about it. I was the first one to ever plagiarize in her class. I'm completely honest and fess up about doing it and why. Turns out I have such a good reputation among the professors in the program that she said ""it's my fault for not making an original assignment"", and says that because of how she knows and has been told of my character, said that she's she's confident it won't happen again, and that she'll chalk it up to an an unfortunate oversight in judgement, and grade me as if the assignment never existed. Grading me like that cost me an A, but it kept that blemish off my record. "

"I would strongly disagree that most of their benefits are around sex and manipulation. That's only a small part of it.

Women are much less likely to be arrested for a given crime, convicted for a given arrest, and are sentenced much more leniently for a given conviction. This is a very important explicit privilege that is the result of equally important implicit female privileges, like the tendency to view men as less moral and women as more harmless, and implicit male privileges, like the tendency of seeing men as having more agency.

On a related note, I get a strong feeling that you're underestimating the agency of women, which is why you believe they are disadvantaged.

And that's just one example of many, many, many examples you will find if you spend time looking into it honestly."

"If any of you guys watch Gossip Girl..Chuck and Blair and Serena and Dan...shit, even if you HAVEN'T seen Gossip Girl this shit is fucked up. 

C/B: Literally gets physically abusive at it's worst. Like, the dude has verifiably sexually molested women on screen and physically attacked Blair. At it's best, both of them aren't happy unless they are involved in drama with each other. The characters spend all of their time wallowing in their own misery. Even the actors were against it and thought it was crazy by the end because the romance was 100% based on sexual sension and was an unhealthy portrayal of ""true love"" on TV. 

S/D: Hoooly shit. At the end of the show, we find out that Dan is gossip girl. That he has abused, threatened, and mentality tortured teenagers..basically for being rich, for YEARS. Then the bombshell, Serena says at the end that she sees what he did as a ""love letter"", and that years of some of the most notorious cyber bullying the world has ever seen is actually kinda sexy and they get together.

Incorrect. 

[It's only 33% of Americans](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2228rank.html) that fit the World Health Organization's definition of obese. I hesitate to say ""only"" because that is still way too high, but nonetheless, not half as you stated. 

Also, the US is no longer the fattest country in the world. Mexico is close to taking that trophy according to current studies. And even countries like Saudi Arabia have a higher obesity rate than the States when only women are concerned - US...40%, Saudi Arabia...49%

Just enjoy what you're doing in the moment, because you're missing on it by recording it. Actually take in the scene with your own eyes, rather than the tiny screen on your phone. Actually pay attention to the person you're talking to rather than checking how many imaginary internet likes you have.

Ive read about omething like this on an IT subreddit. It was some issue at a university and iirc someone accidently sent an email to the entire school, faculty and all. Well all it takes is two ppl to have an auto reply all set up for something like being on vacation or something. These auto replies then sendout an email to everyone all over again and all the other auto replies then send out emails and so on. The whole system went offline due to the huge amount of emails and it took a couple days to fix.

 You figure if a school has 30,000 students and faculty and just 3 have auto reply. 30k emails go out and then 90k responses are sent out and then each email now sends 2 more responses to everyone which 180k emails are sent out after that. and thats just with 3 auto replies. not to mention all the responses of why am I receiving this or and honest replies. Each one has a huge effect with just 3 auto replies. 

But you already knew all that so idk why I mentioned it.

A long time ago, one of my friends won a significant amount on the lottery. Not the top winner with 25 million or whatever, but still a significant sum (still single digit millions).  
So what did he do with it? Spent it all on lavish goods and luxury items, of course (although he dropped about a million dollars into long term investment funds). Bought some cheaper homes just because, then dropped a large portion of it on a mansion in Sydney (god damn are they expensive) with the whole shebang -- massive swimming pool, big front gate with security pass, etc. He also goes out of his way to hires a maid to clean up the mansion every week, because god knows how long it would take to clean it himself. 
 A couple Porsche's and a Ferrari later, and you still have a couple million dollars left. So then he goes around buying non-residential property and smaller places; office spaces, studios and 1B apartments, he goes around buying them and leasing them out. These purchases are more for long term property investments and security.  
At this point he still has a million left or so and doesn't really know what to do with it -- he's set for long term with all the property and investment he has, he has a big mansion to live in, he has nice cars and still has a million dollars left over to play with.  
So he goes down to the local park and sits down at a bench. He sees a homeless guy living in the park and realises, ""I could donate it to charity, or to a homeless fund"" (or maybe invest it and put those profits towards charity). For the meantime though, he walks up to the homeless dude in the park and offers him $500 -- I mean, you've got a million dollars, right? The homeless guy replies, ""Sorry, that's way too much for me... I'll only take tree fiddy"". At this point my friend is confused; but then he realised that this homeless dude is actually 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era."

"There's a lot of expectations. I think it's more than women face, and the social ""penalties"" for not living up to them are more severe.

You are not allowed to be feminine in any way, or you are seen as gay. You are not allowed to show emotion, yet you're supposed to be sensitive too. You must be the initiator in all dates, relationships and sexual encounters. If you have sex you must be hung, be hard on command and perform to her satisfaction. You will be the person who mows the lawn, takes out the trash, and investigates bumps in the night. You may not drink ""girly"" drinks without ridicule. You are expendable; women do not fill out draft cards or stay on sinking ships. You must know and like sports. You will be talked about behind your back by every woman you date, and your sexual performance will be critiqued in excruciating detail. You must be confident and appear strong at all times. You will be the one paying child support and alimony, and you will likely *not* be the one to have custody. You may not be alone around children, and you are discouraged from taking ""womanly"" jobs.

The real problem isn't any of that though. It is the fact that if you fail to do any of this, you will be ridiculed and/or ostracized, and if you complain, your concerns will be marginalized because you supposedly have ""privilege""."

"Sounds a lot like a guy I dated in highschool. He was emotionally abusive. I wasn't allowed to have friends and barely went home (I went over to his house almost every day after school). Wasn't allowed to have a job. (And yes, looking back I know how insane that sounds, but I was 16/17 and essentially abandoned by my parents because ""I wouldn't have listened anyway."")

Anywho, back then, Ontario still had grade 13 (OAC). I hadn't planned on coming back another year, but because he couldn't graduate (failed a class in an earlier year), I wasn't allowed to either. So, off I went to a year of school I didn't need. Long story short, I eventually smartened up, left school and got a full-time job until I figured out college.

"If I were to guess, she rationalized it one of a few ways. It's possible she viewed him as unfaithful because he was watching porn. And when he said he couldn't stop, it was a slap in the face to her. Another option is that she viewed it as an insult to her sexual capabilities. Basically thinking ""He doesn't love me, doesn't appreciate me, he enjoys a video/image more than me."" 

Lastly, it could be that she views porn watching as the behavior of a creep. Something she was told when she was younger, perhaps, or some idea that popped into her head. Throw a kid into the mix and suddenly she's in the same kind of moral panic that people used to have over homosexualiy. 

Then throw in some gossipy friend who also hates porn or gove her some strict religious beliefs and suddenly he's the devil incarnate, a mad porn fiend with no decency or morality."

The reason I made the joke is because I thought of the ""lines of code"" joke and I've seen coke done from an ipad and thought it was pretty clever.

[edit:] Choosing to start doing coke is about as smart as choosing to smoke cigarettes. It won't contribute to your life other than some brief feelings of mild well being in the beginning, it can easily become a habit, and it most definitely can kill you.  
Don't.  
Unless you want to, of course. You're free to do whatever only harms yourself. But as a favor to me, please at least seriously think it through first. Plus it's super illegal."
"It's actually worse than that. People don't use dogs for fights usually unless it's some kind of pure pit or pit mix. These other dogs are used to train their actual fighting dog. They do this by taping the dogs mouth shut so it can't fight back and then positively rewarding their fight dog when it shows aggression/attacks. These dogs are known as ""bait dogs.""

They also use cats. They put the cat in a cage/crate and then dangle it in front of the fight dog who is chained on top of some kind of treadmill to train it to really want to chase and fuck stuff up and not give up until they get it. 

Side note here: if you ever see someone with one of those old style clothing drying racks in their back yard (the one that can spin and looks like an inverted pyramid) and they have chains hanging from it or put their dog on it, chances are it's a fight dog. They use the clothing rack in a similar way as the tread mill and hang the ""bait animal"" a couple feet in front of it to get it to chase it. Unfortunately once the trainer is satisfied, he will allow the dog to get the animal as a reward and to reinforce the prolonged aggression.

Other things to look out for if you suspect someone near you is fighting dogs:

* really shitty looking treadmill in the back yard with a leash/chains attached

* anytime you see a pit running on a treadmill basically (some people might think it's cute or quirky -- it's not)

* a dog that has heavy chain draped around it's neck (strengthens neck muscles to make it harder to kill the dog in a fight, and make the neck larger so it is harder for another dog to lock on)

* tire swing in the back yard that has bite marks on it, or if you see someone let their dog lock onto the tire and then hoist it in the air (this forces the dog to build jaw/neck strength and endurance because it is scared to let go and fall)

It's really horrible and I wish more people new about it especially in college towns where people are eager to get a dog but dump it off on someone when they leave/don't have time for it.

edit: dog fighting is a growing epidemic and many places rely on anonymous tips. Here is a documentary about the rise of dog fighting in Chicago and how even 3rd graders are starting to fight dogs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UozSY6TNgKo. It contains some rough scenes so obviously it's NSFW and not something to show the kids."

"The disconnect I think is if I were to come across someone other than a police officer or solider carrying a gun in the UK they will be a bad guy.  Only a criminal would actually have one.  There is no association for me with a law abiding citizen and someone carrying a gun.  We just don't have that.

Also despite our very strict gun laws being a relatively recent thing (1996 saw a big crackdown due to the Dunblane school massacre) mass gun ownership has never been a thing in the UK.  I think it's just because we never had the whole frontier thing going on.  Well we probably did but at the time the only carry option was a bow and arrow.  

This is from the perspective of being in the UK.  Not saying only a criminal would carry a gun would apply to the US as clearly that's not the case.  You can kind of see how for us it's not even really the gun itself that's the issue but the association of gun and criminal.

"Well, it depends on the people involved really and though is has the potential to be messy, it can end up being very utilitarian.

"Unless your ex is a grade A asshole that deserved that sort of emotional manipulattion, I'm not sure that was an ok thing to do to your ex. "
"Pretty sure it has something to do with gender roles in society.

Girls are supposed to choose wo they have sex with and when they do(which everyone should be able to), whereas guys are supposed to always want sex and never refuse anything, when in reality **everyone** should have complete control over their sexual activity.

So when these situations happen to girls, I think the mindset is often 'shit, I wasn't in control, I had basic rights stripped away from me'(Which is the truth and absolutely right), whereas guys probably think 'Doesn't matter; had sex'.

Pretty fucked up, honestly.
(Maybe /u/bizarrefish92 wants to see this too)

Physical differences play a role as well for sure."
Your hand can kind of replace the sex but nothing can replace the cuddle.
"The humor isn't making fun of the patients so much as distancing yourself from the patients.  

Doctors would all burn out in a year if they didn't find a way to cope.  Burning out is awful.  That is when you actually can't care anymore and stop doing a good job.  

You might make fun of your best friend- you still love them.  In order for me to deal with clients, I have to vent.  Or, I start losing empathy.  

The humor is what keeps me empathetic.  

It is so hard to deal with other people's trauma day after day and still go into the next case with a fresh look and be caring and not jaded.  Without my sick humor, I would not be able to give the level of care I do.  

Until you have had to hold parent after parent as they cried about losing their dreams for their child, as they have to accept that their child has Down's syndrome, you don't know how important it is to be able to make fun of how cruel the world is.  Calling the child funny looking is a way to mentally diffuse the situation.  It is something that you would never find socially acceptable to say and you know these parents are going to have to deal with this their whole life.  Gallows humor is the way you are able to actually feel empathy time after time.  It is a way of connecting with what that patient is going through.  

And if you think parents of Down's children (and Downs children themselves) don't make similar jokes to cope, you would be wrong.  

I've never met parents of a disabled kid that didn't make jokes similar to these as a way to cope. 

Gallows humor is a strange thing.  

Believe me, if your doctor doesn't have gallows humor, they are a lot less likely to be a caring doctor.  "

"I have a question. I'm afraid of dental visits (I usually say dentists but you seem quite alright) so I've switched dentists a lot. 

I brush twice daily and floss and drink enough water and use non-alcoholic mouthwash. About 60% have told me that the fact that I have a LOT of cavities is just genetic or luck of the draw. The other 40% say that it definitely has to do with the fact that I'm Type 1 Diabetic (so, insulin dependent, diagnosed at age 12, nothing to do with my eating habits). 

Is there any literature that links elevated blood sugars to cavities? Or dental abnormalities in general? I have never had a period in my life where my blood sugars were out of control, but even under my best control, I run around 130 whereas a normal non-diabetic will run around 90.

Sorry for the quiz. I just really like to know what science says and it bothers me that all of my dentists have said very different things. The latest one said, ""Well of course your diabetes caused your cavities since the sugar you ate caused your diabetes."" I walked out. "

"Angkor Wat (Khmer: អង្គរវត្ត or ""Capital Temple"") is a temple complex in Cambodia and the largest religious monument in the world, with the site measuring 162.6 hectares (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres). It was originally constructed as a Hindu temple for the Khmer Empire, gradually transforming into a Buddhist temple toward the end of the 12th century. It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Yaśodharapura (Khmer: យសោធរបុរៈ, present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious center since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its national flag, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.

Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology: within a moat and an outer wall 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs, and for the numerous devatas adorning its walls.

The modern name, Angkor Wat, means ""Temple City"" or ""City of Temples"" in Khmer; Angkor, meaning ""city"" or ""capital city"", is a vernacular form of the word nokor (នគរ), which comes from the Sanskrit word nagara (Devanāgarī: नगर). Wat is the Khmer word for ""temple grounds"", also derived from Sanskrit vāṭa (Devanāgarī: वाट), meaning ""enclosure"".

Speaking as someone who supports fax machines and fax servers, I feel you. 

But, it's still the only real time point-to-point electronic transfer system allowed by hospitals, banks, military, and government institutions. HIPAA requirements and such.

Emails are stored on a third party server, even if only for a few seconds, and this is unacceptable for many institutions. We can do Fax Over IP/FOIP (just like VOIP) and do the transmissions over higher bandwidth means, but again it has to be real time.

There are a few new technologies that are trying to replace this, but as the law stands, none of them are legally acceptable.

"Fuck yes, I completely agree. The Drunk Tank was fucking fantastic, and really helped me with weight loss (listening to it while running made 10ks so enjoyable) and back when they were a much smaller company, it just felt like a group of friends talking shit.

The first shorts were fantastic and RvB used to rely less on fancy mo-cap animation and more on Burnie's writing. I always saw them as this shining beacon of reality among a burgeoning tidal wife of artificial bullshit on the internet. Now, they've become just that.

I phoned out completely when the podcast became Gavin acting like a child and people encouraging Barbara's cringey attempts at humour. Also when they did that god awful short that was basically a 10 minute car advert. I could barely convince myself that I was watching something from Rooster Teeth.
