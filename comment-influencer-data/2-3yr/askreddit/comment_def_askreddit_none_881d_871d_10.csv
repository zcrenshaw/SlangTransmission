"I taught myself to code when I was 12.

My daughter has a smartphone that is orders of magnitude more powerful than my first computer, it has always on broadband internet and a high def colour screen.

She uses it for YouTube and Instagram."
"Idk about ""a lot"" but it's def not unheard of for girls to start at 10 or 11. 

Edit: Yes I'm American, no I wasn't implying that 10/11-yr-olds are in third grade. I just meant that third grade is a bit young to say ""a lot,"" and 10/11 is more common than anything younger. "
"Alright throw away for this response obviously ;)

Anyhow there was a time in my teens where I discovered Yahoo Chatrooms had mature chatrooms where you could meet people for voyeurism and such.

At first It was a lot of fun was horny as fuck, young/fit &amp; was not picky at all.

Early on I had a lot of success getting mutual cam sessions between myself and women.

Did not take long before it was ovverrun by bots who would just try and get you to pay sites.

One day I decided to just follow through one of these CAM girls sessions. She was not even super attractive and had no one else in her room. 

It cost me prolly like $70 but I was more interested in understanding what her exp doing this was like and such. We just chatted and such for a bit. Basically found out she was Russian and was hired by a company to put on the shows for shit pay.

Basically long story short she ended up quitting the whole Cam girl thing cause she was not getting enough viewers to make it worth it after middle men took their cut.


We actually exchanged personal emails and kept in contact for a number of years. Basically would send random nudes back and forth and we still cammed back and forth for mutual voyeurism/masturbation (Edit: Did not have to pay for any of this)

Def not the outcome you would normally expect from something but was fun.

She never asked me for money or to try and bring her to the US or anything either. We sorta would just chat when bored and horny.
