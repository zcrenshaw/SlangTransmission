"I agree, or even just social media being more embedded as a social norm. I rarely post anything on fb and I'm already experiencing what Stan did in that south park episode. My mother scolded me because I haven't posted any photos of my new born (even though my ex tags me in every photo she posts of him at my request) quote from my mother ""people are going to think you're ashamed of him"" well fuck them for thinking that? I couldn't care less of what they think of me or my life. 

Basically I just don't want it to come to a point where if you're not active on social media, you will be exiled.   "
