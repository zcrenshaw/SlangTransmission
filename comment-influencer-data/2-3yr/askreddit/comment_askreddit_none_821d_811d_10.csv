"I hear a lot of women in here saying ""talking about how much money you make and your job--it doesn't impress me.""  

Which may be true in some cases.  But in my experience the same women who say this sort of thing, once you get close to them in a relationship, end up caring quite a lot about your job, your money, and your financial stability.  Especially these middle-class women who have this ""I'm working and doing my thing but I'm different than the other women where I work/live on my street/etc.""

No, you're really not.  And if she's managed to make it to her 40s without questioning or understanding her own values, fellas, she isn't going to change them or care about yours.  Which is why self-knowledge is important.  

What a woman really wants is a man who fits into society comfortably without acting like it matters, even though it does for both sexes.  Which isn't some knock on gender or on some individual--it's cultural.  Social programming.  We're all a part of it.  Actual misfits and outliers are not viewed as long-term partners.  The woman's beliefs and behavior toward the individual who does not conform to social rules manifest the social devaluation--her actions will show you more than her words, and you will see how much fitting in matters to her by how she treats you when you don't.  

This is why the women who actively promote and admit to seeking men with status and money, whatever it may be in their corner of the world, are at least being honest by giving the culture an accurate mouthpiece.  Granted, I have met a few women who genuinely didn't care about it, but I have met a *lot* more women who *say* they don't, but do.  "

Peer pressure can be stronger than a persons morals and decision-making. This girl should be arrested for involuntary manslaughter.
People don't tend to like you when you *KILL THEIR NEWBORN CHILD* 
"A religion that encourages children to be baptized at a young age so that they don't understand the full technical vow they are agreeing to. This means that from the second they get baptized ,if they don't follow the ever changing religious code , they can get publicly reproved and publicly shunned by all other members, friends, family... parents... til they die. 

So let's take a trip to the average life of a kid in a religion like this. So let's say when a kid turns 15 and makes a ""mistake"" (like I don't know looking at porn a couple times) their parents are up their ass watching for them to slip up . The parents find out the kid watched porn so they make the kid go talk to these men and go into detail about their sins. The men decide the parents should lose some ""privileges"" and there will be a public lecture given talking about ""young ones"" and porn. Don't worry though this is all private. When the kid is forced to go to the next ""meeting"" it's announced that their mom doesn't have privileges anymore. Oh and their dad just lost his position in the church as well.  The kid sits through it and cries as the speaker starts a talk about porn and kids watching it ....while the rest of the congregation members all know what is going on. Talk about private right? 

Or let's say a kid follows all the rules and grows up to be 18. They've followed the religion and been nothing but the perfect daughter... but she starts to have some doubts. She knows she can't research her doubts because that's forbidden. But some things just don't add up. She has no one to talk to because she was never allowed to have ""worldly"" friends. Aka anyone outside the religion. Eventually she develops some critical thinking and she finds out she really doesn't believe in that religion. Does she fake it for the rest of her life to keep her family and everyone she's ever known? Or does she say ""hey I don't believe this is how to serve God""... and then have everyone she knows shun her? 

Freedom of religion is a basic human right. Raising children that way is abusive as shit. Now I'm not saying people should be forced to change their beliefs.. but if it's detrimental to innocent lives then it's not right. 

I grew up in that shit. I got fucking molested and it was covered up. I couldn't express my doubts because I was so horrified of bringing shame on my family and worse.. losing them and all I've ever known. I have PTSD , major depression, a personality disorder where I let people walk all over me because I'm so scared of rejection. I've tried to kill my self over this shit. It's not taken seriously. It's not considered abuse because "" oh she lived it out 18 years she can walk away now"" . Yeah it's really easy trying to make it in a world u where brainwashed to believe God would destroy . A world u where brainwashed to believe had no love, would beat u down and shit in ur mouth for laughs. A world where u would have no one and be no one. 
And let's not forget u had no chance of getting an education because u spent ur years serving the lord. He would make u smart later on. 

Children should have a choice in their religion. I shouldn't have been forced to go multiple times a week to a place of worship where I would see the guy who molested me. Forced to act a certain way just so I wouldn't be shunned. This post probably will be laughed at but it's been my hell all my life. I'm just trying to make people see this abuse and maybe think twice when people knock on their door.

It is normal though. Humans don't develop the ability to empathize until their early 20s.
"I can't say, I'm under a NDA."
"Ok but 2 people die every second, so you should be over it by now if you want to give everyone a shot.

Or you could save your empathy for things that actually matter like people in your life and/or people who actually deserve it. "

"This is just a jumble of denialism. The naturalist fallacy may be wayward in lots of ways, but it's basically a simplistic categorization that, given the massive destruction we have wreaked upon the world, would certainly have led us less astray.

So unless science can offer a better way, you can't denigrate the use of the ""naturalism"" razor. That may not be fair to science and technology, but the planet doesn't care if science's feelings are hurt.

So, I say we should all live more ""naturally"". Hell of a lot better than living more ""capitalistically""."

"Fresh fish has no smell at all. What you ate was old rotting fish. 

Edit: ok I may have been a little dramatic in my phrasing, but I stand by it. Fish deteriorates very very quickly. If there is ANY smell at all it is because on a cellular level it is decaying. Fresh fish has 0 odor, but keep in mind fishermen are trying to make a living too. They will sell you 1,2,3 day old fish and tell you it was ""caught today"" in order to make as much money as they can from every harvest. "

"They might be just thinking that you are putting something in your mouth bigger than you can swallow.

Let's put reddit's motivational quotes aside. Those are for fools.

Let's put 'how woman can't do shit' aside. Those are for people in 1970s.

Let's start with why some engineerings 'aren't for girls'(in reality, this applies to any candy princess, male or female).

You are going to be working in dirty places. For example, construction enginners are expectedto work like workers when the engineering part is over. You will have to stand exhausting physical work. You will have to get your hand under the stone. But more importantly, you will have to get over the social stigma of how girls can't do hard work.

Does the last part have any reality to it? Yes, it does. I am a guy on the same road like you, from a kind of a third world but not really country, just a year older(12th grade now) tryna go for machinery enginnering or mecatronic engineering. I am not used to physical work as my dad would simply hire people to do that for us. My grandpa has a plumbing business for construction corporations. Last summer I worked with him, mainly because we have been plumbers since 5-6 generations and my grandpa wanted me to learn the craft.

I am a long guy. Not muscular, but strong compared to my peers. But let me tell you, the physical work was eye-opening. You are using all your strength to get that pipe into the other? Use twice as much. Oh you finally got that in? Come carry some cement to the 5th floor. Yes, I know you are a plumber not a worker, but it's not like you have anything else to do! It took me a year to get used to that kind of physical work and I almost gave up so many times. If you arent used to physical work, I suggest you to not take up something like a construction engineer. And a gym workout for 5 years won't get you used to it. You need notmonly strength but lots of muscle memory to be ready for that stuff.

Let's come up to the social stigma. People will more often than not hire a male equivalent(or worse) of you instead of hiring a 'girl engineer'. It is what it is. And don't expect it to change soon. It also depends on the field. Female industrial enginner? A blessing from the heavens. Female construction engineer? Nah, would rather hire this guy which has a worse score than her.

You should get past all the people that tell you what you can or can't do. Know yourself. But be realistic. Because nothing is worse than struggling for something for 4 years and learning that it is worthless.

Edit: lel the downvotes for being realistic"
