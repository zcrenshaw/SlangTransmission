"When my co-workers make jokes (playfully, so I can hear/respond) about me being in a bad mood just because I'm quiet, which, in turn, puts me in a bad mood, making me even quieter. Or I'll confront them and say that I am in fact, not in a bad mood, I'm just busy or whatever... which always comes out bitchy for some reason... so then they def think I'm in a bad mood. There's no winning. "
"I used to work in a public library. Free resources become a Mecca for trashy people, unfortunately. Here are some highlights:

-A dude was using the public restroom to de-scale a fish for dinner. When questioned he said he didn't want his home to smell. That place was filthy.

-A bum unpacked his suitcase and set up camp in the periodical section.

-Teenagers fucking in the children's section.

-Men CONSTANTLY watching porn in full view of the general public. Including children.

-Prostitutes soliciting in the front lobby... during story-time.

-A social worker of some kind berating staff and generally acting like a terrible human, in front of the 3 young men she was assigned to mentor. 

I could keep going but this comment will be buried anyway.



EDIT: requests for more...


-Smoking weed in the library restroom. I don't care about blazing up AT ALL, but there has to be a better place than a library full of kids.

-Teens fooling around in the stacks ALL the time. Once a week minimum. My boss would call their parents.

-Told someone she couldn't rent 10 DVD's until she paid her 6.00 late fee. She said ""I wasn't gonna return them anyway,"" and walked out smugly. She showed me!

-Refused to rent a 12? year old an R rated movie and she told me, ""I'd come over this counter and slap you but my mama taught me manners."" Umm... Clearly.

-Kicked someone out after 20 minutes of shit behavior. She told me Barack Obama would take care of me and left chanting his name at the top of her lungs. Pretty sure Barry-O would have taken my side on that one!

-Getting hit on by a pre-pubescent teen wasn't trashy I guess, but definitely awkward!

-Dude brought 3 large, ill-behaved dogs into the library &amp; insisted they were service dogs. One pissed on the floor. He threatened to punch my manager when he was told to leave! That guy got arrested.


Job was in North Charleston, SC right off the Air Force base. It wasn't ghetto exactly but def not classy. Every library sees stuff like this! I moved on because the pay was shit, but left with some good stories I guess."
"2Pac and Biggie aren't the best rappers to ever live. Everyone only says that because rappers say it 

Edit: My top 10 is, in no particular order: 

Big Pun, Big L, Eminem, Andre 3000, Lloyd Banks, Mos Def, Canibus, Jay-Z, Nas and #10 could change depending on how I'm feeling but right now I'm gonna have to give it to Ice Cube. "
