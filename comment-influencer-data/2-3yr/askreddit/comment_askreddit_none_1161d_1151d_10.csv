are you actually incentivising discrimination against people who have done nothing wrong because somebody far away with a skewed world view who identifies with their religion did something despicable? Holy shit i knew reddit was starting to become bigoted but seeing someone openly advocating for discrimination is a new low.

"In response to point B) I would say that I already explained that in my comment by assessing what the Democrats have been doing for the past 60-70 years. 

Yes, equating modern Democrats to slave owners is obviously retarded, however, the historical legislative acts that have happend under the guise of ""progessivism"" are what is under debate here. 

We have a culture that is more prone to attribute acts to race than in the 90's. We have literally regressed in the past 26 years. Under Obama our racial tensions have surged to the peaks they were during the Martin Luther King days. 

I'm not saying having a black president caused this, I'm saying specifically Obama made this worse with his constant rhetoric that defies statistics."

"Yes, because I have no reason not to. "
"I once worked for a couple of French guys who made all their money in unrelated businesses.  They had of course dined at some of the best restaurants in the world, and thus decided they were qualified to open a restaurant in Miami Beach.  

This place was a shit show from top to bottom.  I drank so much while I was working there that I almost turned into an alcoholic.  You will understand why later.

To begin with, the front of house was stealing from the business for at least six to eight months before they were caught.  The restaurant was a ""french bistro"" concept with a high price point in the middle of a largely Jewish neighborhood.  The name of the restaurant was so awful that I won't be repeating it here.  I worked there as a Sous Chef for about a year and a half.  In that time I worked under four different Chefs, one of which was an actual crackhead.  One Friday afternoon we were getting ready for service and he was like ""I'm going to run home real quick an do some laundry.""  We didn't see him again until Monday.  

One night everyone was partying after hours and suddenly there was a stripper dancing on the bar who only had one titty and there was tampon string hanging out of her pussy.  (You're thinking at this point that I'm making this up, but I swear to God it is true.)

One night my Chef at the time, who I had become pretty good friends with and who was an expert at functional alcoholism, actually fell asleep for a brief period in the walk-in freezer because he had been out until six in the morning with a stripper with one titty.

"Back in 4th grade I remember my friend Paul asked if he could borrow my Super Mario Allstars game. I said, ""of course."" I brought it the next day, fucked around in the playground playing wrestling. Two days later he didn't show up and I didn't think anything of it. He probably got sick or maybe had a doctors appointment. A whole week passed and he still hasn't shown up. I'm kind of worried. I mean, he's my friend. I give it like two more days and finally I ask our teacher if she knows what's going on with Paul. ""Oh. He moved. He didn't tell you?"" I couldn't believe it. That son of a bitch borrowed my game knowing he was leaving and never mentioned it. I'm still pissed about it. FUCK YOU, PAUL! "
"Insult me all you like.  God knows you aren't the first, and you won't be the last.  All it really does it make it apparent that you don't really have a leg to stand on.  We have a difference of philosophy, and that's okay.  

I'm not sure how the fact that you ""predicted"" my response somehow makes it incorrect.  

You haven't really had a conversation with me.  You've just attempted to belittle and insult whatever I've said.  That isn't an honest conversation, so it's difficult to take your assessment of libertarianism seriously.  Rather than actually attempt to understand it, you're just looking for ways to say it's naive and stupid.  

And you have every right in the world to negotiate with your ISP.  Have you never called them and gotten your bill knocked down a few pegs?  You should try it.  I bet it would work.  

No, you don't have a great deal of leveraging power.  Because you aren't the one with something someone else wants.  They're providing a service that we've made ourselves dependent on.  That doesn't mean they owe us anything, just because they were smart enough to put themselves in that position.  

The internet is not a natural resource.  They didn't just find all of the internet and hoard it for themselves.  They built the infrastructure that gets it to your house, and yes, that means they get to set the terms of how you pay for it if you choose to buy it from them.  They hold more cards than you.  It happens. 

The argument from precedent is weak.  It's obvious I'm not in agreement with the government on the issue of access, so pointing out that they've done the same thing with electricity and water isn't really very persuasive.  "

"I can only give a second hand point of view as my family and friends tell me from back home. I've gone back for a week or two but I go to school in the US. 

So. First off before I even start. Not all Muslim people are bad. I do not dislike Muslim people, I dislike terror.

They wash up on the shore, they hop on planes in hidden areas. I.T Landing gear areas. Yes this has happened. Most die but a few lived. I can't find the source but there was something somewhere.

They come through Turkey, and move inward via car, train or foot. Its sort of how Illegals get in to the US i suppose?

If you go to Roma for instance, you'll see them selling roses which are actually usually stolen. As soon as the police come by.. They scatter. The police don't usually do anything though. 

The refugees aren't the problem as a whole. Yes its overwhelming and can cause problems as far as living economics wise.. But its the terrorist who blend in.

A lot of Italians, young and old do not like them at all. Italians are also known to not care for black people. I personally do not care who you are. Just be a good person.

They usually get targeted and attacked. You won't see it on the news but some muslims get attacked by locals. 

Now after the attacks in Brussels and the Battle Clan concert. Many Muslims got looked down on very much. Some were not even sold goods, simply for how they looked.

I'm not saying this happens all the time, but it happens.

My mother and father are apart of the town community, which is like.. How you say Overwatch of community? Kind of like the neighborhood watch but they just go to meetings. Them and many others will go out of the way to make it harder on a refugee to live in the area. Though Messina isn't huge; its a port of Scilly. Cruise ships even stop in aswell. 

Many do not want them in their area not out of fear but anger.

I want to say maybe 50-100 refugees live in the area? They were placed there by the Government as a placement method. This was what the EU agreed upon when doing the refugees.

Its easy to say.. ""Oh well.. You're way over thinking a terror attack could happen by you.""

Most attacks get foiled but some don't. 

We're connected via land. Unlike the US where an ocean separates you. "

"It was horrible. We had to take a quiz that matched you up with people, and based on those answers, she seemed just fine....until I found out how crazy she was. All she would do was study. Every day and night, she'd sit at her desk and study. To study, she needed quiet - and any little thing set her off. I couldn't watch TV, had to use headphones absolutely all the time, and the worst part was that she didn't want people over - even if they were helping with homework! It was ridiculous. Eventually she ended up dropping out and I got the room to myself for the rest of the year. The kicker was that my 2nd match based on the quiz became my roommate for the rest of college and she was wonderful."

Something horrific.
"Walter White is *not* a textbook psychopath. His character certainly has a high degree of narcissism - something latest-generation Americans certainly relate to - but the entire point of Breaking Bad was a man whose initial intent to leave his family something after his death spun beyond his own ability and will to control.

*Breaking Bad* is critically acclaimed because it was the best television available in probably over a decade, with immersive screen-writing, amazing and relatable drama, and an epic of storytelling about a man with good intentions fell by his own sword, despite his intelligence and intent in succeeding. There's so much more to Breaking Bad than ""*Walter White is a sociopath and America loves the show because they love sociopaths*."" I couldn't think of a more inept understanding of appreciating drama.

I've been in the workforce for over 15 years now, and I've never gotten the impression that my labor was as valueless as it is in North Korea or China. I've always been consistently compensated on the terms of employment, and the companies I've worked for have appreciated my efforts - in both fields of skilled and unskilled labor. I'm there to work, after all; I'm not there to get a life-coach to make me feel good about myself. So I work hard, because I'm not a child who can't not being constantly stroked.

If you're in a job you hate, chances are it's because you don't have the experience to get a job you like. If this is the case, keep working and build a reputation and resume, and eventually work your way to something that makes more money in a field you enjoy. If you've never worked a job in your life, you have no idea what you're talking about."

Many, many other dynamics were involved in the rising tension which led to that event. It isn't like we would've had 40 years of peace and happiness if that one assassination hadn't happened. 
It is not possible to point fingers at an event, person or government, it is far too complicated to have a sole entity to blame. 

It is a matter of philosophy and economy and many different interests of many different people that defines history and world politics. 
It is not simple, and trying to fully understand all these dynamics is exhausting, maybe impossible.

But I do find (at least in my industry) the people around my level, if you're always late, it's expected.  If you're always early, it's also expected.   I've been given shit for being 5 minutes early before because ""You're usually here much earlier!"""

"I'll kick it off... middle school... we had pretty simple wooden desks - not your modern compressed wood ones, but proper dead tree wood screwed onto a metal frame. Once they became even a little bit wobbly we found they were easy to break. So occasionally on a bored lunch hour a bunch of us more feral of the children would smash one of these desks into a hundred pieces and then set about the jig-saw puzzle of assembling the shattered desk as carefully as possible at the front of the room (in the teacher's path to her chair, or straight in front of the board).   Teacher comes in ""who put this desk here? rrraawr!"" and proceeds to lift it out of the way... desk falls apart into a hundred pieces at her feet... class: ""miss! you broke the desk!"". We did that to the same teacher it must have been five times in a year and she NEVER cottoned on... never even ordered a student to move the desk for her. Weird."

"I'm commenting a little late, but I can promise you, those ex girlfriends who viewed you differently can politely fuck off.

As someone who has also dealt with similar actions at a young age, it takes a lot of courage to openly tell someone what you've been through. I can guarantee you will find someone who does not judge you for that, does not look at you strangely, or that becomes uncomfortable with you.

I told my SO and was in fear that he would view me as broken, disgusting, and every negative thought you can imagine. You know what? He thought of me as *strong* and *brave* for telling him and viewed me only in a positive way. That honestly changed a lot for me and helped me love myself a little more and hate myself a little less.

Sorry for the novel. Just saying, there are plenty of wonderful, decent people who will not judge you for previous events such as sexual abuse. *Internet hug.* "

"Much more tame than some of the other stories, but when I was an ignorant animal loving kid, I found a baby snake at the end of my driveway. I knew my dad would be back from the store soon, and I didn't want the little guy to get run over, so I coaxed it into my arms and carried it to the woods. It was pretty relaxed in my arms, it didn't rear up or do any threat displays at me.

Then I went about identifying the snake. It was a baby cottonmouth. The snake and I were both totally fine in the end though! The key to helping animals is to make yourself as nonthreatening as possible. The calmer you are, the calmer the animal will be. This apparently applies to cottonmouths as well."

"I've always loved Bill Cipher from Gravity Falls because I think it's incredibly clever how the writers drew inspiration from real-life conspiracies. You see this demonic triangle guy on TV and you think, ""I've seen him before."" And then, simply because of how common and iconic the eye of providence is, you start noticing how often the guy pops up in daily life. Whenever you see the symbol in the show (which is quite often), it's supposed to be one of Bill's all-seeing eyes spying on the protagonists. So now whenever I see a dollar bill, I think of how he's always watching humanity. It's just a great way of connecting the universe of Gravity Falls to reality while allowing the audience to interact with/be reminded of the show in daily life.

In short, we've all seen Bill Cipher, even if we don't watch Gravity Falls."

"My parents had an... interesting relationship towards the end of their marriage. I generally use two examples to try and explain how my mother behaved during this time (which lasted throughout my teen years). First, I tell the story of the Frozen Chicken Patties. In brief, my mom had a preference for Tyson chicken *patties* - not the fillets. One day my dad got home from doing some shopping and he'd bought fillets. She began screaming about how he got them on purpose just to bother her. Second, there is that one time my dad had this little heart attack. On Thanksgiving. It was actually pretty mild, when compared to other heart attacks - but it was still a heart attack, so it was serious. While we stood in the hospital room with him after we knew he was stable, I swear to god... she said that he'd had a heart attack *on purpose* to ruin her Thanksgiving. 

So now my girlfriend (who also comes from an interesting family and understands the need to laugh at such things) will, when I disagree with something, etc., say to me, ""Yeah, well you bought me the wrong chicken!!"" to which I will always reply, ""Stop ruining my Thanksgiving!"" (or vice versa) "

I was at a bar and it was really loud.

I like thousands of other kids from NYC was able to test into a better school in a better state that involved leaving my family as a kid, and I learned the hard way that being an A student in the NYC public school system equates to being a C-/D student in a better school system.

Mines was a case from NYC which has one of the largest, most scrutinized, public school systems with an incomprehensibly large, and abused budget. I can only imagine the issues faced by smaller school systems in predominantly black neighborhoods and cities or even rural communities. I'm sharing my story because the ""go to school and you'll succeed"" narrative is a farce, children are educated to different capacities and poor communities, black communities, and rural communities get the short end of the stick.

"Growing up my family owned and lived on a dirt road in the country. My grandpa had a barn with a tractor in it and there were always these large wasp nests all throughout the barn.

One day my brother(10) and cousin(9) were throwing golf balls at this one massive nest (literally the size of my 6 year old head) trying to knock it down. I grabbed a ball, threw it, then turned and calmly walked away as chaos erupted behind me in the form of a a couple hundred very pissed off wasps.

They turned and ran for their lives as the swarm chased them and ignored me. My brother still brings up my complete lack of fear, in reality I've just been extremely apathetic my whole life."

"Men and women experience sexuality differently (As a rule of thumb, there are always exceptions). 

Men tend to be more practical. They want to like what they see and feel what they feel. Physical sexiness is an important characteristic to them.

For women, how they feel about sex is more important. It's more about feeling connected with someone else, and feeling wanted.

How does this affect thing? Well when men want to feel aroused, they look at porn. What you see is what you get. For women, they like to read about sexual things, as they can dwell upon it and have a sexual response to how the text makes them feel. Since they like to read it, they also like to write it."

I never even explained to them that I stoped doing drugs, they each called me about 5 times over the week asking if I had any, I said no each time. They stoped calling after that, maybe they pieced it together, or maybe they never really cared about me and only liked my drugs. None of them went to college, one is in prison right now.

"No, i assumed that for two reasons:    

1. he lives in Detroit, which is a black majority city, thereby making it likely that he's black.
2. i've seen a lot of blacks that actually join Islam because it's not a 'white' religion, as stupid and foolish as that may be.
3. Most people are unaware of the huge amount of slavery that Islam perpetrated.    

&gt;And any proof it was worse or there were more slaves taken by Arabs?

Muslims cut off the balls and penis of any black slave they caught. Slaves were nothing more than property that could be discarded. Here's a good start on the atrocities:     
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_slave_trade    
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_slave_trade

David Livingstone's diaries are also great, because they show a first person view of how brutal the Arab slavers were.

&gt;Or that the slave trade was dictated by Islam? 

Muhammad himself had slaves and endorsed slavery, which means that it is halal for all muslims to have slaves (for if Muhammad allowed it or commanded it, then it is allowed by God).

&gt;Or that Mohammed hated black people?

Here's a story Muhammad told:

&gt;Shem, the son of Noah was the father of the Arabs, the Persians, and the Greeks; Ham was the father of the Black Africans; and Japheth was the father of the Turks and of Gog and Magog who were cousins of the Turks. Noah prayed that the prophets and apostles would be descended from Shem and kings would be from Japheth. He prayed that the African’s color would change so that their descendants would be slaves to the Arabs and Turks. Al-Tabari, Vol. 2, p. 11, p. 11    

Keep in mind that Noah was considered a perfect human being, so this is actually in praise of Noah."

Can confirm. I laughed quite a bit.
"Right.

As for the Boxster, the radiators are sideways, in front of the wheels. So one could argue that if you were to hit a lampost hard enough to puncture the radiators (50km/h according to OP, that's fairly hard), you'd get all the way to the wheel. Or, and I'm guessing that's why they are there, the bodywork would deflect the impact (in OPs story the car is wedged around the lampost).

The 996 uses the same setup as the Boxster, with 2 radiators mounted in front of the wheels.

In both cases, the radiators aren't straight but turnt to the outside, so in case of a front impact with a steel or wooden cylindrical object, they are unlikely to be damaged if the car ends up stuck around it.

I guess it is possible (but unlikely) that the shock took a water hose off its mount, spilling hot water out of the system.

One could also argue that most of the steam doesn't come from the puntured radiator, but from the coolant/water dripping on hot engine parts, which both of those cars don't have at the front.

Also, it was an off-the-cuff joke."

"A garbage weight lifter? Well if that means wearing shirts with sleeves and not constantly staring at myself in the mirror, then yes, I'm a garbage weight lifter. I don't care if someone lifts more than me either, I actually enjoy it because it can be very motivating. 

It's arrogant sure but I'm just being honest to u/audlJeff's question, We have good genetics for strength and size in my family without really working at it. My older brother was an O Lineman in the NFL ffs, he was 6-7 and around 325. He never used supplements other than protein shakes and he was benching 495. At my peak I was benching 405 without a spotter, and I'm not built like a benchpresser, I'm just under 6'-4"" and have long arms, I don't know how tall you are, but I can tell you that benching 405 with long arms is fucking brutal. I'm not quite as dedicated as I used to be but the last time I benched it was 365 w/o spotter. There are ripped dudes that go to the gym 6x a week, and still can't lift as much as me. That's a major ego booster for sure, I have a couple friends who can lift more than me but they're on steroids, fuck that shit. I'm just proud that I don't need that shit."

"My opinion is if the race of a character is irrelevant to the character, I don't care if they change it.  People complained about Khan being white, and people complained when they thought there was going to be a black guy playing the Stormtrooper clones.  But I don't see the issue in either case.

&gt;No, see, it's ok for people of color to replace historically white characters, real or fictional, but doing the opposite is racism and appropriation.

By the way unless I'm misreading, it seems you're implying that there is more uproar against it one way than the other.

Honestly, I've seen the uproar in both directions.  Plenty of people have been annoyed at the changing of a race of a character from white to something else, or the potential for it even.

In fact, I think I've seen more of that.  Since the only example the other way around I can think of is Khan.

Do you believe it's the case that there is more uproar about characters in new versions of things being changed to white compared to being changed to non-white?"

"Well, it's not so much shoot to kill vs shoot to wound, when learning to shoot for self defense, you are taught to shoot until the threat stops - either the attacker has dropped their weapon, has retreated, or can no longer move. Especially when adrenaline is pumping in a real life scenario, it'd be almost impossible to aim just for someone's limbs. They're narrow, they move, and on top of all that, if the femoral artery is hit, they'll bleed out in minutes anyway. On top of all this, you are only supposed to use deadly force as an absolute last resort - you must believe your body and/or life are in immediate, imminent danger. If you are under such a threat, a wounded person may still present that level of danger (if they have a gun, for instance). 

These are general rules, and the laws vary state by state - some are stand your ground (i.e. shoot at will), some are duty to retreat (i.e. only shoot if you've exhausted all other options, including leaving your own home). Others, such as Texas, allow for you to shoot at someone who is committing a crime that doesn't necessarily involve you or another person (i.e. attempting to steal your cattle, which is a problem that still exists)."

"For homicide it's 3.5 per 100,000 in the US. The majority of gun deaths are from suicide. There would be fewer suicides without guns as availability for a particular method of suicide actually matters. That is, if somebody set out to kill themselves with a gun but couldn't find one they don't always look for another way to kill themselves. However this only pushes a suicide attempt to a later time, it doesn't stop them forever.

Short of wearing stilts and shoulder pads, many women will not physically intimidate men. And so many women are (sexually) assaulted, attacked etc regardless of how confident they outwardly appeared, trust me. It is just annoying for a woman to hear a man act like there is a simple technique that can effectively help stave off attackers when it comes to men attacking women.There isn't. Your advice applies to men being attacked by men. Appear like the bigger man and you will not be touched. That doesn't work for us, sorry to disappoint. That's all.

"&gt;Government Housing Programs Ease Housing Costs for Some. Federal, state, and local government housing programs generally work in one of two ways, by: (1) increasing the supply of moderately priced housing or (2) reducing housing costs for some households.

&gt;Programs That Build New Housing. Federal, state, and local governments provide direct financial assistance—typically tax credits, grants, or low–cost loans—to housing developers for the construction of new rental housing. In exchange, developers reserve these units for lower–income households. (Until recently, local redevelopment agencies also provided this type of financial assistance.) Data suggests these programs together have subsidized the new construction of about 7,000 rental units annually in the state—or about 5 percent of total public and private housing construction—since the mid–1980s. In addition to direct subsidies, some local governments increase the supply of affordable housing by requiring developers of market–rate housing to set aside some of the units they are building for low– and moderate–income households, a policy called “inclusionary housing.”
Programs That Help Households Afford Housing. In addition to constructing new housing, governments have also taken steps to make existing housing more affordable. In some cases, the federal government makes payments to landlords—known as housing vouchers—on behalf of low–income tenants for a portion of a rental unit’s monthly cost. About 400,000 California households receive this type of housing assistance. In other cases, local governments limit how much landlords can increase rents each year for existing tenants. About 15 California cities have these so–called rent controls, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland.

Neither. Its a question or heart and morality. Guns are just a tool that people use. There is nothing inherent about them that make people violent or protective.

"Or you just use brick, like Europe."
Is that because you can't see him?
"i don't think guns do anything to change the hearts and minds of people. guns make violent situations and violent people more dangerous, but they do not make people more violent. 

as for making people safer, not really. a little bit. people definitely do use guns to deter attacks and violence, but there's no evidence that the same effect couldn't have been achieved with lesser means of self-defnese. 

also why do safe and violent have to be mutually exclusive? it's possible to have a very violent society where people are relatively safe. this would probably be in a place without guns where violence would be less dangerous. it's also possible to have a non-violent society that's very unsafe. human trafficking and drug problems aren't exactly violent, but they sure as hell aren't safe. by asking this question you're creating a false dichotomy between violence and safety.

Additionally your real world instance as far as I can see doesn't provide any confirmed details of the story you outline as being what took place. The trial is due to start next year and as far as a search online goes, it shows that scant details of the events that unfolded on the night in question have been made available and several sources suggest that a direction the case is going to possibly take is that the 'intruder' as you so put it was going to attend a house party. There is also no mention of a baby monitor, nor if the people in question happened to be armed, have access to any armaments or most of the bullshit you've been spouting to anyone that provides an answer contrary to the direction you want everyone to take to support your pro-gun agenda.

I get it you have a gun boner. However, you seem to be blissfully unaware of what a loaded question is. 

Lets try another question. 

Pro-gun people. Guns are now outlawed in your nation, possession of one is an offence that carries a strict penalty of life in prison. What do you do now.

FYI - you say keep a secret gun, I turn around an use my loaded question to say police get an anonomous tip off that you have it/that records show you own a weapon and haven't disposed of it to the letter of the law etc etc etc

"All that, but usually (not always) it takes the cop a few minutes before he walks up. I'll use that time to get my license out of my wallet and insurance card from my visor. (Tip: keep your insurance card tucked in your visor mirror. You'll always know where it is and won't have to rifle thru your glove box, which makes cops *very* nervous.)

Then my windows are down, engine off, dome light on (if it's night), hands on steering wheel and info in hands. I'm in Texas. We have to have a LTC to walk around armed, but don't  need a license to buy a gun and keep it in the car. I'm not anti-gun, but I don't own one myself. Never have. But cops will frequently ask if you have a weapon in the car, so I usually beat them to it by saying that I don't. 

Doing this literally got me out of a very expensive ticket at 1am. I executed a *very* illegal 4-lane change in order to exit the freeway, then was doing 65 in a 45. Cop saw the lane change and followed me for a bit before hitting his lights. I was looking at about $500, and I can't take defensive driving because I have a CDL.

When he saw I had everything ready for him, he broke into a big grin. When he asked if I knew why he stopped me, I fully admitted to my stupidity and *did not argue*. Arguing is the surest way to a ticket. A lot of times, they just want to get your attention. 

""Have a good evening, Mr. ecafsub. Slow it down, ok?""

Yes, I'm a cracker. I'm so pasty white I reflect light in a pitch-black cave. The cop was Latino. But 1am make any cop nervous. Their jobs are hard enough and they do *not* get paid enough. I've known dozens of cops of the years, and I'd have to say that most of them were Good Guys. One I knew was kind of a dick, but even then he had a proper sense of duty."

"Dude, you're the one being a douche. First by correcting me without thinking ""hey maybe this is just a typo and who cares?""

Aren't you aware of how people just going around and correcting others is annoying and people don't like it? It's like you're on some mission to spread knowledge about spelling and yet you target people making simple typos rather than people who can't actually spell. And then you get further offended when the person you are correcting doesn't graciously accept your correction. I don't need your help spelling, I didn't ask for it, and your going around like the spelling police is far doucheier than anything I've said to you. Oh thank you! Thank you so much for pointing out my error. If that's all you can do to participate in a conversation I feel bad for you."

If I was to crop up in discussion and suggest that everyone start fearing for their lives [at crosswalks](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/pedestrian_safety/) and [when they step into a car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year#2010_detailed_statistics_and_death) instead of in [interaction with a police officer](http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/unarmed/), I'd get the same reaction.  
  
  The correct response here is that ""a random black guy"" should not have to *fear for his life* at a traffic stop, instead of deflecting for ""a random black guy"" to fear for his life walking past another black man on the sidewalk."

"I would need more information as to why that hospital was bombed before I would consider them terrorists. 

&gt;Terrorist is a point of view.

Sure. And everyone knows that when they say ""terrorist"" they mean people who bomb, murder, and terrorize innocent civilians to get what they want. It's mostly understood that when you use the word terrorist, that's what you mean. Pointing out the fact that other people like to use different words to describe it that doesn't sound quite as nasty is irrelevant. 

&gt;you consider a certain kind of person a terrorist because the media told you to.

Ha ha. No. I consider a certain type of person a terrorist because they fit the definition of the word. This ""brainwashed by the media"" rhetoric is just a tired old attempt to criticize what I'm saying without actually offering any substantial reasoning to back it up. You know nothing about me. Don't act like you do. 

&gt;But if you walk into someone else's country and start killing people and blowing shit up, YOU become a terrorist in their eyes.

So? Depending on the situation maybe I AM a terrorist. I never made the claim only one country can produce them. I would consider a terrorist from America just as awful as one from the middle east. If you fit the definition, then you fit the definition. "

Here, the many reasons from his own mouth he is a horrible person and should never be President of a Golf Club let alone the most powerful country in the world.

“(John McCain is) not a war hero…. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.”

“When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump’s Castle, told the New Yorker for a September article. “It was the eighties, I was a teen-ager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back.”

Trump disparaged his black casino employees as “lazy” in vividly bigoted terms, according to a 1991 book by John O’Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.

“And isn’t it funny. I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it,” O’Donnell recalled Trump saying. “The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.”

“I think the guy is lazy,” Trump said of a black employee, according to O’Donnell. “And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”

""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering."" – Trump overestimates the number of people cheering after 911 by thousands and stuck with it even though he knew what he said wasn’t true


""(Obama) doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there's something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim. I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that.""

 “An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud.”

“Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?! I mean, (Carly Fiorina’s) a woman, and I'm not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?

“You know, it really doesn’t matter what they write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.”

""You could see there was blood coming out of (Megyn Kelly's) eyes, blood coming out of her whatever.""

“I don’t think Ivanka would do that [pose for Playboy], although she does have a very nice figure. I’ve said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.”

 ""The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families.""

“We’re losing a lot of people because of the Internet. We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people who really understand what’s happening and maybe, in some ways, closing that Internet up in some ways.""

Trump’s racial incitement has already inspired hate crimes. Two brothers arrested in Boston last summer for beating up a homeless Latino man cited Trump’s anti-immigrant message when explaining why they did it.  

“Donald Trump was right — all these illegals need to be deported,” one of the men reportedly told police officers.

Trump did not even bother to distance himself from them. Instead, he suggested that the men were well-intentioned and had simply gotten carried away.

“I will say that people who are following me are very passionate,” Trump said. “They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.”

"Registration should be required, and there should be a harsh penalty for avoiding it.

Background checks should be required to buy or sell guns.  When a check is performed, it generates a one time use code.  When someone buys a gun, they give the seller that code which the seller can enter into the government website to transfer registration of their gun to the new owner, authenticated by the code.  The site will show the picture of the person registered to confirm ID. This avoid the gun show loophole, as background checks can be done ahead of time and then private sales can be made.

If a gun is lost, destroyed, etc.  it must be reported.  Obviously some level of judgement will need to come into play on these laws since you surely wouldn't know right when your gun was lost or else it would never be lost.

Found weapons can have their serial number entered and pull up the current registered owner.  Not sure if anyone should be allowed to do this or just law enforcement.  

There will surely need to be other detailed worked out, but the idea is a simple and intuitive registration system for managing ownership of guns.

Under certain circumstances owners may be required to prove possession, and any gun confiscated in a crime would be able to be traced back to the original owner.  

Not sure what the current penalty is for filing off serial numbers, but in this new system the penalty should be quite high, and anyone who sees such gun is required to report it such as a pawn shop owner or gun repair shop.  Without a serial number the gun could never legally change hands, so if you are in possession of a serial-less gun, you either modified it, or stole it.  If it is just found on your property, there could always be the argument that it was planted, but that can be the case with any evidence."

It's more of an acceptance if you will, for we really don't have much of a choice. Just because the US military is lesser than the other evils in their eyes, they are still an evil.

And the thing is, in many countries where there is a US military presence, the country either isn't truly democratic. It's quite complex, but I wouldn't call the US' military functions worldwide as wholly an act of altruism."

"Except the key fundamental flaw in that sentiment is that the child is the parents responsibility they chose to bring into this world. They are obligated to care for the child (weak people think they have no obligation) and mental issues are ALWAYS the fault of the parent, whether if they caused it directly through abuse/neglect or indirectly through ignorance. 

I've dealt with shitty parents all my life who made me feel bad for being alive since it was a drag on them financially and my dad never could see the world since he had to take care of me and I should be grateful he doesn't run off with other women as if it's some fucking achievement. I can detect bullshit parents a mile away. 

Chances are the parents are abusive and/or neglectful and refuse to accept any smidgen of responsibility for their daughters suicidal tendencies. People want to think the things they say during angry outbursts are not true but that's bullshit and we all know it, anger just removes the filter we have for a bit to say what we really want to say then once it's out we snap back to reality.

"&gt;Make no mistake, police killings of blacks are disproportionate to our part of the population.

Whoa, I think you might be touching on something there. Probably where there are protests, wouldn't you think?


4 golds, for a black person saying that a black protest is ""irrational"" on Reddit, no less.

&gt;But the larger problem is militarized police, no-knock raids, and blind trust in police both on a citizen level and within the criminal justice system. 

[Actually, the larger problem is the criminalization of drug posession which was designed from its very inception to target black people.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/)

Black people get arrested far more than other groups despite identical usage. Police manufacture nonsense reasons to investigate random civilians who aren't even suspects, and escalate routine traffic stops to cover their ass, because they know the stops are unnecessary.

&gt;By focusing on race, 

This is what makes people enraged, you know? There is absolutely no benefit in being inclusive of everyone *because it isn't happening to everyone*. Police aren't going through Berkley, or Hudson Valley liberal arts colleges arresting white kids for minor possession of cannabis, giving them criminal records that prevent them from ever finding stable employment.

So it's *unnecessary to include them.* What including everyone else *would* do is allow them to hijack the discussion and downplay the significance of what's happening within the context of how mostly privileged white society sees it taking place.

*Think. Just think about it.*"

"The electromagnetic force is one of the elements at play with friction correct? This is a very complex question to ask becuase at what level is friction turned off? There are many factors that apply. Air causes friction but if doesn't slow down objects then it has to be displaced. Microscopic differences on two surfaces cause friction also. Maybe I'm just taking the question to serous. I still think if you turn it off every thing would end up in a big ball.

Edit: Also the turning it back on would cause the explosion because of all the speeds that would suddenly have to stop. Friction causes energy to turn into heat. Heat + sudden stopping + a big ball of random earth stuff = explosion."

"First, I would drive to the local toll road company office. I would have to pay with cash or credit card on my way over to the office, but once I got there, I would sign up for an EZ-Pass or other electronic toll collection (ETC) system.  

They would likely have agreements with other toll road companies to accept the same ETC, just like bank customers can use each other's ATMs, so I could drive most places without having to stop to pay. 

Next, I would visit the private businesses that now provide security and firefighting services and sign up for a contract.  The security company's service would pay for a home security system that would alert a patrol car in the area of any break-ins or other emergencies.  The firefighting company's service would be similar, and pay for remotely-monitored smoke and CO2 alarms and the actual fire trucks and firefighters. 

After that, I would subscribe to the new Consumer Reports-type websites that evaluate drugs, hospitals, medical equipment, etc, for safety and effectiveness.  I would also regularly read local restaurant review sites that keep tabs on the safety and cleanliness of the restaurants.

Finally, I would visit some local homeless shelters and food banks and donate some of the money I'm saving by not being taxed.

What is the point of a character's death, if it doesn't change anything ? I didn't feel that Jon changed much...

Also, none of the lords in the room seemed to care about the fact that he deserted the Night's Watch. But then, it is a running gag in the series that nobody cares about the Wall.

Also, he let Wildlings through the Wall. You would expect the lords of the North to be concerned about this, but again, they don't care.

"The only aspect of Skyrim and Oblivion that is better than Witcher is modability and both games are buggy and have absolute shite main stories, KoToR 1+2 had a comparatively boring, shitty combat system, bad graphics and poor writing in some areas (although yes overall the writing is incredible, it can fall down in some areas), Dragon Age Origins also had worse combat and graphics in addition to an unimaginative core plot that was only redeemed by the execution, Fallout 2 again has bad graphics and combat only with bad UI to make it worse, whilst F:NV was riddled with bugs on launch and felt very unfinished in many areas. Deus Ex (assuming you're talking about the original, not the new one) again had poor graphics and combat with patchy writing in many areas paired with absolute garbage voice-acting, Mass Effect 3 sucked (especially the ending) and whilst it had fun and fluid combat, ME1 and ME2 had somewhat boring combat, although I will concede that ME2 is the closest to TW3 levels of quality out there. Diablo 2 was a fun point-and-click game but had very little beyond the core gameplay to make it stand out.

Meanwhile, the only standout issues I can think of for TW3 are some bugs regarding Roach standing in funny ways and very divisive combat (some people hate it, others like me love it).

Just to set the record straight here though, I fucking love all of the above games. I've played the shit out of all of them, and every single one you listed is an amazing experience, but none are objectively as good as TW3. That's not to say that you can't have favourites other than TW3 of course, but I can't think of a single game that is as high-quality as TW3 and thus my statement that it is the best game ever."

"&gt;I'm a normal person who now has the capacity to defend myself at least a little bit in the event something I hope never happens actually unfolds in my life.

On the contrary guns are likely to add more to your problems by giving an illusion of safety. For example take this situation, how on earth could have a gun have helped when everyone was ultimately safe?

Reddit is very pro gun but in all these threads I have never once seen guns keeping people safe or even situations where guns would have

1) There is a reason people talk about trainings as even very well trained police officers do not manage to de-escalate situations when guns are involved

2) In order for guns to be effective, you should know about the danger in advance and have the gun immediately ready. However, in such cases, if you are already fore-warned there are a 100 different things you can do too just like OP did and was safe

3) Guns also add to other accidents (for example the recent case of a mother shooting her daughter dead as she thought of her as an intruder). Or people shooting at people who came for help

4) Guns always escalate the situation instead of de-escalating. Guns give you the confidence to actually confront an attacker or an intruder where every self defence class teaches you to de-escalate

5) In actual conflicts it is very rare that lives get lost unless guns are involved

6) Of all the danger which can meet you, guns can maybe save you in 0.001% of them if you are forewarned and lucky

But I know all these points will be ignored. Because you are an American. You have grown up hearing about guns and why they are important for safety. The NRA is worth billions and has been spouting propaganda at you since you were a child. There is a reason all other civilised countries don't believe in guns while American swear by them. Years of propaganda cannot be changed by some facts. Just like people laugh at the middle eastern who swear by thousands of year old book or by a nomad Prophet so do the rest of the world at American who will defend guns to death when the rest of the world believes they are useless and a sign of distrust of your neighbours and humanity"

"No he was spot on in his original point. He said they should protest not to battle ISIS but to show the population of the UK that the Muslim community does not approve of the actions of ISIS.

Some may say there is no point because anyone with half a brain knows not all Muslims are in ISIS, but as someone from the UK I have not really seen any really prominent Muslim groups come forward and spread the word of peace and the message that members of ISIS are not real Muslims they are scumbags. 

There have been loads of stories here in the UK of Muslim communities protecting terrorists and those who want to join ISIS or leave for Syria to train. I feel more should be done by those communities to hand suspects in and shun them from mosques if they feel they are becoming radicalised, at the moment its tough for many people to separate radicals and just your average Muslim since one is screaming hate and the other says nothing."

I'm a white american, I've never started a war, I've never voted for someone who wanted to start or did start a war, I've never bombed anyone, I've never voted for anyone who ever bombed anyone, I've never even gave words of support for any war or bombing campaign.

So what aspect of my whiteness has created radicalized Muslims? Where does my responsibility lay? "

"An amazing thing has happened lately. Outside of the US is starting to not be able to hide they are just as bad or worse than the US.

A few years ago, the US was the most racist place on the planet per Canada/Europe. Now I really really have to try to not find a racist/discrimnatory stance from a European country.

A few years ago only the US was denying global warming. Now there are several in that group.

Homelessness and claiming poor people leech the system. Visit Vancouver for your share of that. 

Honestly, it's kind of awesome that all western countries are starting to lose their ""high"" ground to stand on. But then again I'm the US and it's good to see that they were at our level all along."
"&gt; Why do you selectively quote me like this.

Selectively my ass. I quoted the majority of your post, and the part I left out continued with the very relevant ""or whatever"".

Don't know why you're so offended. I just wanted to point out a misunderstanding, it seemed you had read /u/icallshenannigans' ""the big news subs"" as just ""the big news"". That's being helpful. You're welcome.

&gt; It's completely obnoxious. 

I don't agree. Maybe you're easily obnoxified :)

&gt; I even said ""or whatever news website of your choice"" specifically so you wouldn't be pedantic

Specifically for me, some stranger on the internet you had never interacted with before. Uh huh.

The ""ehhhhh"" was just a throwaway expression of doubt. I could have expanded with an argument how any major mainstream media outlet is self-censoring and biased to a significant extent, and that you will probably be exposed to more points of view on the issues on reddit than there. Or that your one named example, CNN, has a front page that's mostly filled with click bait and celebrity news nowadays.

But that felt like too much effort at the time. I assumed you would read the ""ehhhhh"" as an ""I have some mild doubts about that, my friend"", but it instead, it seems you took it as something else. 

&gt; but you're still being pedantic.

"Social unrest. And it's not by circumstance. For all of the black vs white, gay vs straight, liberal vs conservative, and any other derision on the basis of opposing viewpoints, it really comes down to haves vs have-nots. No, this is not a pro-Bernie post. No this is not a income inequality rant. 

If we turn the clocks back 100-125 years, black folks and white folks simply didn't interact on the social level. Segregation of the most extreme form was the norm, and even the non-racists among society knew that crossing the line could put them in danger. What the lynch mobs and Klan never stopped to think about was that they shared the same common oppressor as the black American.

Look at the Ludlow Massacre. Predominantly white coal miners on strike were quite literally executed by a company's private guard and the local National Guard. Consider the education standards in southern schools for white children as well as black and Hispanic.

The idea that an entire race or creed of people are your enemy is an engineered social cue, created by people in government, industry, and religion. It boils down to simple misdirection. If you can get a man to hate someone based on some trivial identifier to a point of frenzy, it's not too hard to exploit him without raising eyebrows. Eminent domain, capital gains tax, the Patriot Act, etc. are all freedom-crushing implements that we tend to take as ""part of life"". But if we as Americans had less in-fighting, it's hard to imagine a nation where the Diane Feinsteins and Dick Cheneys get to turn us into 2nd class citizens. 

A united citizenry is more dangerous to the elite than anything else. All the legislation and legal precedent in the world won't do you any good if 315 million people all say, ""No."" But if those same people are busy killing each other, and trying to illegalize each other, it's the equivalent of crabs pulling each other down in a bucket.

"Sure thing. 

On the topic of discrimination against blacks in colleges. [Black students want to be segregated](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/25748/) in some schools, abet with special privileges. They feel that they need ""safe spaces"" from white people. They also want ""black housing"" that is cheaper, because some black students have trouble affording college. Not low income housing, black only housing that is cheaper. (Sidenote: As a white male I have personally experienced discrimination when applying for college. Not only were many scholarships unobtainable by me, due to being black / female only, but black students get extra weight on applications for being black.)

[Being black instead of white nets you on average 230 SAT (on a 1600 scale) points worth of application weight](https://www.princeton.edu/~tje/files/Admission%20Preferences%20Espenshade%20Chung%20Walling%20Dec%202004.pdf) while recruited athletes gain around 200. Simply being born black is worth more to colleges than being a high skill athlete. Yay quotas. 

On another note, some women believe the 77 cent for every dollar statistic is due to men being sexist (where in actuality, if women made less for the same work, why wouldn't you hire more women?). It has [been debunked](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405), and can be explained by women choosing lower paying fields like pediatrics or psychiatry, taking more leave / maternity leave, working less hours to lead a home life, or even not working at all, choosing to be a stay at home parent. 

Yes, if you averaged every man's wage, averaged every woman's wage, and compared the two numbers, women make about 20% less than men, however most if not all of that can be explained by women *choosing* less pay for more benefits. Finally if you're a woman and can prove you make less than a man because of your gender, you've got a lucrative lawsuit on your hands. 

As far as making a counter movement goes, I believe that if there is a vocal group of people spouting a bunch of bullshit about how they deserve *even more* special privilege just for existing, or because their grandparents fought and suffered for their rights, there needs to be a group of people to call them out on said bullshit. It's like having a gremlin on the wing, if you say nothing for too long, you end up with having to choose between a criminal and a nutjob for your next president.

You're only bi-sexual if you're attracted masculine men. You're only gay if you attracted exclusively to men. You can stop questioning your sexuality, but maybe stop watching so much porn."

"You are forced into a lot of things against your will at birth - your race, genetics, location, parents. Children and infants don't have an absolute right to bodily autonomy and self-determination, as this is really impossible. 

Parents should be able to impose reasonable things upon their children, as they are the ones responsible for them. For religious people, circumcision is part of a sacred covenant with god, which has the highest value in the well-being of ones's soul. They should be able to do something for their kid they think is a moral requirement as long as its reasonable. 

As far as making up your own religion, that is some reductio ad absurdum stuff. Religion is a social institution that connects individuals, families, communities and god. You can't just expect to start your own religion and expect the same respect that widespread religious beliefs for 2000 years or the majority religion of a country gets. Not to mention starting your own religion from BS premises is not genuine - the supreme court has rejected similar challenges to drug laws from people who have started fake weed or mushroom worship religions.

I quickly realize this is a dream. I can do anything I want!!

"I think that the souring of the BLM name isn't BLM's fault, but is a perception held by people who would have thought the same thing even without any videos, although it is an obstacle that BLM must now overcome.

&gt;This means very little. White people are perfectly capable of hating white people.

I think you might have misunderstood what I said. The OP said that BLM is a hate group against white people. And I was saying that if BLM really was a hate group against white people, they wouldn't accept white participation in their movement.   

&gt; It's getting drowned out by the hatred and bigotry that it's loudest members are supporting.

And I disagree that its loudest members are supporting hatred and bigotry, but I do know that this is how it is perceived. I think this comes from how a lot of (mostly) white people are reacting to positions that aren't actually attributable to BLM, but are rather the products of misunderstanding through no fault of BLM's. For instance, assuming that saying black lives matter means white lives matter less, not wanting to be disrupted or inconvenienced by having to deal with BLM in their daily lives, or assuming that pro-black can't also be pro-cop. The burden, unfortunately, is on BLM to overcome these misunderstandings, and perhaps there are things they could do differently to narrow in on these specific points of tension. But that minor criticism cannot take away from the importance of the issues at hand and I think BLM deserves full support regardless of whether one thinks their operations are disorganized. "
"While I will briefly touch on gun control in this reply, I will take more time to discuss your argumentative methods, and why you will never convince anybody of anything using them. This is because I care much less about gun control than you think I do.

Let's start at the top:

&gt;false most violent crimes are committed with blunt instuments and stabbings, not guns. Only 3% of murders, for example, are done with a gun of any type

Actually, what I said is not false. What I said was  actually perfectly in line with what you said. Most violent crimes would happen with or without guns.

&gt;As its clear you've never tried to buy one, you have no idea whats involved. ""Hurr durr gun show loophole"" Oh that thing that doesnt exist? Yeah dont bother

I never once mentioned that loophole, because, as you said, not a thing.

&gt; They didnt make it a right to own guns for hunting you idiot. EVERYONE hunted just to survive back then, everyone had a gun, they made it a right after the British tried to disarm the populace...GEE I WONDER WHY?

Ok, first, never insult the other person. By calling me an idiot, you've now committed a personal attack on me, and that's not helpful if you want me to agree with you. (which I'm assuming you do, because you put so much effort into writing your comment.) nobody is going to listen to some jackass that insults them for their beliefs. So, don't be a jackass. Be respectful, and it'll be much easier to convince people to listen to you.

And yes, everyone hunted to survive and the British tried to disarm the populace. In the 1770s. It's no longer the 1770s. If the Federal government wanted to take out you, your guns, or anything else, they could. The United States spends so goddamn much money on our military, that no civilian could beat them. I've been inside the Abrams tank. To try to argue that you can take that out with your gun is lunacy. If the government wants you, they'll get you, so ""fighting the government"" isn't a valid reason to own a gun in 2016. There ARE valid reasons, like hunting, or recreational shooting, but fighting the government is not one of them.

Additionally, the guns in the 1700s were nowhere near as deadly as the ones we have now, if only because they didn't work very well. I can't speak for a dead man, but I don't know if the bill of rights would be written so broadly in today's world. But, it is. And you're correct, you have the right to bear arms, which I respect.

&gt;Go to England and try to get a law there to ban tea or beer because they are fattening to cut down on health costs for the NHS...see how well that goes

The United States tried to ban beer once, and it didn't exactly go great. I'm not advocating the banning of all firearms. That's silly. Just some restrictions to keep the true crazies from doing bad things. Will this mildly inconvenience legal gun owners? Yeah. But you need a license for lots of other deadly things, even ones considered essential, like cars, or things that are more like toys such as boats and jet skis. These licenses are harder to get than gun licenses, even though it's a lot harder to commit mass murder with a jet ski. That doesn't make much sense to me.

&gt;you know, except that is been proven over and over again

I didn't say it would stop them, but it *would* make their lives slightly more difficult. 

&gt;this is pulled right out of your ass

Obviously there are no hard numbers on a hypothetical situation, otherwise I would use them.

&gt;you can believe it all you want, but its not true. But if you want to worship at the altar of gun control with your faith in one hand and your brady propaganda in the other, thats your right, ill just point out Europe and California to you and you can just keep ignoring them and worship the god of gun control

This part really doesn't help you. This was your biggest mistake. I don't worship gun control. I barely care. It's not in my top-10 list of important issues of our time. You're trying to make me sound like some fanatic Sanders devotee who won't listen to any new viewpoints. That's simply untrue. My opinion on this issue is not very strong, and could easily be changed. Instead of reasoning, you chose to go for insults. That makes your whole argument look bad, even though you've made some pretty good points.

&gt;tl;dr all your edited points are poorly thought out and were proven false ages ago, accept the fact you are wrong and your downvotes, and move along 

Nope, my first one was correct, at the very very least. I can accept downvotes, Internet points don't matter to me. This isn't about Karma. This is about a discussion on an important issue of our modern political discourse. 


I've not been convinced that I'm wrong, because all your points are about *banning* guns, and how that's unhelpful, which I fully agree with. There is no need to ban guns. But I still believe some regulation wouldn't hurt."

"&gt; Well not everyone wants to live in an isolated enclave with nothing but asphalt and generic strip malls everywhere. But that's what most urban land in the US is like.

Yes but a lot of people do like having an actual backyard, not living on a busy street, not having tons of random strangers walking through their neighborhood where their kids play all the time, not having their living space literally 1 wall section away from someone else's living space. Having a garage, a backyard, a deck, a pool, a front yard, a full driveway, a street where you are at least familiar with most of your neighbors and don't have a ton of strangers there all the time is actually pretty attractive to a lot of people. Kids can go trick or treating, you can have a BBQ in your back yard or have the neighbor's kids over to use the pool. Plenty of space for everyone. And part of making that sort of lifestyle feasible is having common businesses nearby. Those ""generic strip malls"" have places to get your and your families haircuts, restaurants that might not be top not artisan eateries, but are at least mostly enjoyable to a family of 5, a Walgreens to get some quick groceries, flu shots, cold medicine, etc without going to the big grocery store a few miles away. 

Despite you stating that ""not everyone wants to live in _____"" you don't really seem to understand that very same concept yourself. Not everyone wants to live in a city.

yet you answered your own question 4 times in 4 minutes on an extremely popular public messaging board...but not at all because you wanted to draw the attention of other people?

"I'm very familiar with the concept. I'm not telling you that they shouldn't be paying their taxes. I'm telling you I think it's foolish to get people upset this way when I already dislike our party having to pay for those four homeless dudes' meals, special dietary concerns for half the party (some of which is their fault), a down payment on future meals I may never eat, a bribe to have the waiter deliver some wine to other tables and poison breadsticks to others, a incompetent kitchen staff that just stands around, and a dozen other things. 

Should the millionaire be paying? Obviously. I never said he wasn't. But I think it's foolish to try and make it some sort of moralistic crusade when, in reality, I feel like what I spent on my meal was wasted anyway and the additional cost to me as a result of the millionaires actions is so low it's barely noticeable. It's exactly the kind of populist nonsense we're used to seeing from the likes of Sanders and Trump, but it's still disappointing."

"From a scientific viewpoint. The episode where Phoebe doesn't believe in evolution pisses me off. 

Not because of Phoebe, that's fine. It's Ross. 

He's a scientist, but he's unbelievably hesitant to admit that he could be wrong about evolution. 

Fuck right off, Ross. You're a shitty scientist. This is how it should've gone.

Phoebe - Come on Ross, you scientists have been wrong about all sorts of things, you have to admit you could be wrong about this. 

Ross - Of course!  That's what is so awesome about the scientific method. It's not about belief, it's about evidence. All the evidence we can find indicates that the theory of evolution is correct. Additional evidence can certainly change that, and it is changing constantly!

Ross demonstrates multiple times that he's actually really shitty at his job. 

Edit. Phoebe is wrong. Evolution is correct. But this make sense for her character. Ross is supposed to be a scientist, but gets in a huff and storms out when Phoebe makes him admit there's a possibility his ""theory"" is wrong. This treats Ross' understanding of evolution as nothing more than a firmly held belief, just like Phoebe's.  Ross should happily admit that theories change with evidence, and been thrilled to explain why this was a good thing. "

"As resistant as people on the internet would be today to it, I think there will be within the next 10-30 years a religious revival with the internet as its primary medium.

I think it will be like the opposite of the 80s TV worship craze. Instead of conservative TV priests leeching off of people who don't know better, you get progressive religious and spiritual leaders using the internet to connect to people and connect people to each other. 

Religion will evolve to connect to a new audience and you'll see a new age of spirituality that compliments accepted science instead of flying straight in its face."

"~~I watched a history channel thing on what would happen if Earth stopped spinning. Apparently, the atmosphere would keep going. At approximately 1,000 miles per hour. So, there's suddenly be 1,000 mph winds blasting everything, and the friction from this would scorch a lot of it.~~

~~It's been a while since I took physics, but I'm pretty sure that if there was no friction for 10 seconds, Earth would suddenly spin A LOT faster (assuming that with the current spin, the atmosphere applies some level of friction that keeps Earth from spinning faster). This sudden acceleration would probably turn everyone to goo in very short order.~~

Edit - Short story; I was wrong.

&gt;Think about it like this. If you're spinning a bike tire, and gently place your hand on it, then you're adding a source of friction. If you let go, that removes the friction. What does the tire do before and after you let go?

You touched on the reason why I don't like the BLM movement. It's not just black people that are being killed. They kill everyone and here they are saying stop killing black people.

"Not Ghostbusters, that's for sure."
"Their constitution is a mess. The country identifies with Islam but the ataturk screwed them over with overboard secularism. While Im not objecting to secularism since I don't want to be down voted into oblivion. If your country is 60% muslim? Then how is not mentioning Islam once in the constitution going to work? A lot of people want religion to play a part in their political system and anyone who does on an official platform is seen as an ""Islamist"" (not referring to erdogan he's a mad man) . The notion of a secular military is not going to work either if there is a conflict of interest within the state, just because erdiganerdogan (yes this is what he auto corrects to now) was over the top doesn't mean that everybody loves secularism and hates erdpganerdogan. There are many who object to him and are in favour of a more islamic system after all the real identity in that region was brought by islam. Before there was just a bunch of warring States divided by the Mongols. The modern Turkey just squashed their identity and history and force fed them with post ww1 propaganda. They need to have a balance between secularism and a more islamic system so both sides benefit and you don't get a coup d'état every 20 years when the Islamic favouring leader gets unfavourable according to 'constitution' and the military feel obliged to take over."

"Women's bodys are usually far more revealed in movies, ads, and real life. It isnt unusual to see a woman in scantily clad clothing.

But it seems like a man showing any skin is seen as disgusting and indecent.

For example: A fit woman in a string bikini at the beach? A-ok. A fit man in a speedo? Cover the childrens eyes, make gagging motions, maybe even asked to COVER UP, etc.

I'm not buying the whole ""women find different things about men attractive"". In ancient times for example they sculpted nude men because the male body was admired and reverred. Also look at any dimestore love novel..the cover usually features a shirtless hunk.

Ive never understood why men are covered up like nuns and women are featured with hardly anything at all. I feel like each gender is at the extreme, women almost show too much, and men show nothing at all.

As a gay guy its incredibly frustrating... as a guy I am wired to like visual things. My straight guy friends get their visual stimulation from the scantily clad women. The women get to see men in power/authoritative positions or whatever.. and I am left with nothing.

Where are all of the scantily clad guys?? I like chizzled thighs, asses, and bulges. Seems I am S.O.L."

Considering Hillary is about as pro-establishment as Romney, I don't doubt she would have the same connections to rig certain locations. Combine that with vote suppression, media blackout and marginalization of Sanders and his supporters by the same media and astroturfing companies, and we end up with  a very simple scenario of so much information going against us that we simply can't recognize nearly all of her successes may be almost completely contrived.

Tin foil hats, dismissal, etc. all of the arguments against me fall into play with the establishment if these things are true.

"Most comments here aren't really unpopular at all, especially within the confines of Reddit. Let me give you some honest opinions from my the bottom of my heart that will surely rub the majority of you in the wrong way;

- Democracy is not that great. Most people are too stupid to know what's good for them. There should be a test that one must pass in order to vote. But even that may not help since it is easy to manipulate even smart people into believing pretty much anything. 

- Some cultures are inferior to others. 

- What is holding back the Middle East is their religion. Until they stop being Muslim they will remain poor, underdeveloped and hopeless. 

- Capitalism is much better than communism. But it inevitably leads to a similar result in the long run; a small minority of elites using the rest as slaves. Only social democracy such as what the Scandinavian countries employ work in the long run. 

- America may fall apart from within in the near future. To many uneducated religious morons with guns and too much racial tension. America was great once but since 9/11 it has begun a very rapid decline that at this point irreversible.

- Religious people are fucking retarded, regardless of their religion. 

- Gun advocates are even more fucking retarded.

- Multiculturalism does not work in a democracy. Racial tensions are unavoidable and can only be managed by a ruthless undemocratic leadership. 

- The EU is going to collapse from unsustainable levels of immigration and corruption. Spain, Italy and Greece etc are not equal to Germany and are too inefficient and corrupt to deserve to be a part of the EU. 

- Rugby sucks. It's a stupid, ugly sport with no grace or finesse and is only enjoyed by mouth breathers.

- Donald Trump band Brexit are not anomalies. Both are signs of much worse things to come.

I view it along the same lines as our innate love of carbohydrates and simple sugars. It used to be an advantage for seeking out energy-dense foods, but technology moves a lot faster than evolution, so now that most of the planet isn't struggling to avoid starvation anymore, our drive to seek out super-fattening foods is actually killing or sickening a lot of people."

"So one day my mom remarried to this guy and he has a son, he was my age and he’s black, by the way I’m Asian. So, my step brother is friends with my boyfriend, he’s white and plays soccer. My step brother’s cool, he plays basketball and is really built. So one day, my mom and step dad went on a vocation and left my step brother and I home alone for the weekend. Nothing really happened, I stayed upstairs and he stayed downstairs. One day, my step brother invited my boyfriend and another one of their friend to come to our house, he’s Spanish. So by now there are there guys at my house who were all downstairs. My boyfriend then decided to go upstairs in my room to ask me something. He asked me to go swimming with him and his friend at our backyard. I didn’t really accept it since I was the only girl but he said it didn’t matter since we were all friends. So when he left, I changed into my bikini and went down to the pool. All those guys were built and had amazing abs. We spent about three hours in the pool, playing volleyball and other games. Afterwards, I went upstairs to shower while the guys stayed downstairs watching a movie. After I showered I tried grabbing my towel but it wasn’t there and so were my clothes and bikini. I realized that my boyfriend and his friends just wanted to pull a prank on me. My chances were that they were still downstairs watching a movie so I just decided to run to my room all naked and wet. So I got to my room and locked the door behind me. To my surprise, the guys, just my boyfriend and his Spanish friend, were behind my bed. I was so embarrassed since I was naked so I quickly grabbed my blanket and tried to cover myself. My boyfriend then came over to me and told me that he made a bet with his friend and that he lost so his friend would make out with me. I didn’t really want to do it but I accepted it anyways. So the guy went over to me, he wasn’t wearing a shirt just his swim shorts, you can really see his dick through it and how it was hard after seeing me naked, and grabbed me and kissed my face while grabbing my ass through the blanket. He made out really well, better than my boyfriend. There was a knock by the door, so my boyfriend went over to open it and let in my stepbrother who saw us making out. He also saw how I had a blanket covering myself so he told my boyfriend to take it. My boyfriend took the blanket away from me and I was basically naked around them. I was still wet and was so embarrassed. The minute they saw me naked their dicks went hard instantly. All three of them came up with the plan to have sex with me, so my boyfriend told me. Again, I din’t accept it but the guys dropped their shorts and started rubbing their dicks while walking towards me. They practically surrounded me with their hard dicks. They had big dicks to be honest, my step brother had the biggest though and it was honestly massive compared to my boyfriends. They were all so wet and had huge dicks so I decided to just go with it as I was also curious. My step bro and the other friend told me rub their dicks for them so I did they were they were the size of my arm. My boyfriend told me to suck on his while I rubbed on their dick, only half of his dick actually fit in my mouth. Afterwards, they switched around and I just blew three guys. After that was all done they were harder than before. My boyfriend went and lied down on my bed, my step brother than lifted me up and put my on top on my boyfriend doing reverse cowgirl. It hunted so much having a dick up in me but it felt so good. While I was riding him, the two other guys stood on the bed and shoved both their dicks at the same time. After five minutes the Spanish guy grabbed me and lifted me he was holding me up while trying to put his dick in me. So he was fucking me while literally standing up it was great and after a minute he dropped me on the bed. My step brother than came over and started fucking me too, again he had the biggest and it hurt badly when he was in me. He then lifted me so he could be on the bottom. I was riding him and at the same time my boy come over to fuck me too. My step brother in my ass while my boy at my pussy. It felt weird having two dicks in me but it was great. The Spanish guy felt left out so I grabbed his dick and blew him again. They all took turns fucking me and we basically spent the entire afternoon, like four hours having sex. After I felt so sore so I just lied down in my bed, the guys who were all hungry ate my pussy and ass, fingering me and licking me everywhere while I made out with my boyfriend who switched with his friends afterward. They were all ready to cum so they moved their dicks near my face and they spread their cum in my mouth and body. I was basically filled with cum and so was my bed. It was great and I licked the rest of the cum from their dicks. After they licked the other cum from my face and my body to wash me off. Then we decided to go swimming again, naked, and continue to fuck there. It was all wet and breath taking. After another hour of fucking in the pool I decided to take another shower. They followed me into the shower so we just showered together, our shower was big anyways. So I rubbed soap all over their dick while they rub soap in my boobs and my pussy. Finally the night came, and I slept with all three of them naked in bed. Till now we still have sex together, sometimes when my parents are away I have sex with my step brother alone. When I visit my boyfriend I have sex with him in his room. I play volleyball and so does the Spanish guy and we have practise at the same time so after practise I pull him into the girl’s locker room and into the showers, I also had my friend with me, so I took my clothes off and my friend took her clothes off and we both took his off. We turned on the shower and gave him the best time of his life. So yeah that’s my sex life. "

"What about keeping it off? There are virtually no scientific studies showing diet &amp; exercise works for weight maintenance (defined as weight loss for several years minimum). 

WHen you lose weight you set off a cascade of endocrine changes that make you gain the weight back. Appetite goes up, metabolism goes down, fat oxidation goes down, fatty acid synthesis goes up. The end result is that you eat more, burn less and your body becomes better at storing fat and less efficient at burning it. 

Until medical science fixes that, obesity will be an issue that affects 2 billion + people on earth. Scientific evidence does not show diet &amp; exercise to be effective permanent solutions to obesity, they only work temporarily until the endocrine changes take over and you gain the weight back. Most people are not able to counterbalance these endocrine changes with lifestyle alone. 

Diet and exercise are almost totally ineffective at counterbalancing the endocrine changes that we evolved to help us survive famines. The people that do manage to lose weight and keep it off for years on end due to diet &amp; exercise are the exception, definitely not the rule. "

Though both have manual element pickers to block certain things, I also find uBO's logger easier accessible but I haven't really used AdBlock's. Also uBlock Origin has a auto-malware filter set up that will block based off of sites you go to and block those in the future even if not read as an ad (same with various domains and certain elements that are only pseudo-ad). Also I believe uBlock Origin has an additonal multi-purpose filter list over AdBlock which is another reason some prefer uBO over AdBlock. 

A large amount of what I've experienced though may be due to settings but even if you do a clean install of both, (if done right, only using not even 0.5% extra memory usage) I think it's worth it to get uBO working on top, in case of any filter settings ( even if rarely used)"

"I was unaware of this because there was no such threat made to the US.

If you think it's a threat than you're just looking for reasons to hate the guy.

&gt;That comment may be out of context, but it's one testament to his character

That the guy was a celebrity and had sex with women in an era where people are a bit more lax about drugs? He didn't drug anyone forcefully according to what he said.

Admitting the comment is out of context pretty much takes away any credibility you have here.

&gt;it's pretty irrational to hold a rape case to the same solid evidence standards as other crimes.

And here's where you lose the rest of it. It's entirely rational to hold it to the same standards of evidence,  people who think we should erode due process for the sake of feelings are a bigger problem than Bill Cosby ever could be.

I'm still dumbfounded that people will assume guilt based on no evidence and a rabid media narrative. Brush up on your history, hundreds of men have sat in prison for years only to be later vindicated because of people like you."

I don't know if the exact number of shots fired has been released, but the positioning of police at a demonstration like this may have been such that it was more like shooting fish in a barrel.  He could have been selecting his targets, but still missing frequently.  Without knowing the positioning of everyone in the crowd, and how far officers were from the protesters, it is difficult to say that the end result would have been much different from a layman who had only brief experience with the weapon."

sociopaths views you as a threat, and they recognize each other as they recognize normal people.

they are natural liars, since they have no conscience nor remorse. they are go getters and have no moral values. they wont stop at nothing to achieve social status.

they will often say you are a loser for not being a go getter, but this is another form of social engineering. to keep you down and mental-logically accepting them as superior than you.

He was killed because the police knew assaulting him would only result in more death, for both the police and him, and negotiations had failed. Also, the shooter obviously had trouble getting guns, and what did the second amendment get him? The other people who were accused weren't at threat of being killed by a drone strike, because they talked to the police willingly, and crucially, didn't shoot at officers when they tried to approach them. 

 There are occasional protests, but ""The civil unrest here is insane right now"" is incredibly wrong. In the context of American history, what is happening now is nothing. There were riots so large, the army had to be deployed to put them down, entire sections of cities were destroyed and some areas have never been recovered. What happened in Baltimore is nothing compared to the Watts riots, the New York draft riots, the Rodney King riots, the 12th Street Riots. There are a few protests, but that is nothing compared to what there have been in the past. 

Bad people might do bad things, but not having guns limit the damage they can do. Also, even if they have guns and normal citizens don't, that is still safer than the situation we have now. Taking away the second amendment won't change the government's ability to have weapons, but it won't benefit anyone for the government to become a dictatorship, which relies on force to get people to do what they want.

I suspect this will all go over your head. Considering the level of intelligence shown by your post, I am surprised you can type, and I think some of the words I used you might have to look up, but maybe you will learn something about critical thinking while you are at it.

Do the math, the more people who have guns readily available to them and have the ability to carry them with them without question, the more likely mass shootings are going to happen.

Side note, I am not American so I would like to ask, ""why is the individual liberty to carry guns so important to you?"" Personally, I think I would feel less safe being surrounded by people who carry weapons even if I had one on myself, versus, no one carrying weapons.

I can't for the life of me remember what it was called, but my friend whos husband was first refused a spouse visa to enter the UK was advised by her immigration laywer of the method.

It involved her and her husband moving to another EU country to live and work for three months. After this he would have then been able to apply for a resident card and they could both move back to the UK under EU law and bypass the UKs visa system.

While I don't agree with families being split up and basically the govenment saying unless you have money don't fall in love with a non-native, (so I'm glad this option was there for her), it is a system open to a lot of abuse. As a non-EU citizen all you needed to do was find a UK national working in the EU looking to make a quick buck and bob was your uncle. Free entry to the UK, once in wait awhile then divorce.

"You stfu. It's okay when a cop does it right? I don't condone shooting innocent cops, but the system being so reckless with who it puts on the force and how they're punished for being murderers has people pissed off at life and goddammit, they have every right to be. That's when people snap and shit like this happens. When cops fix their shit this won't be necessary. Castile doesn't get a second chance at life. There is no coming back. That cop being a pussy robbed him of his life and he was licensed is the worst part."

"&gt; This isn't about me. I can argue that something is unjust without wanting to actively get something out of it.

You're right. So what value does adding a white person's opinion about the BLM movement do for the advocacy of blacks? I think a justice movement for black americans should be focused around the black experience. A white person shouldn't need to share their opinion at an organizational meeting. If you want to be an ally, why not just listen to the people whom you feel are being treated unjustly? What value does ANY white person's opinion about these issues have when the point of the movement is about making sure black folks have a voice that is heard?

&gt;Your original question was 'why does it matter if only black people are allowed' which, might I add, is not the exact same question as 'why do you (white person) need access', which you changed it to after I informed you that 'people of colour' refers to everyone who isn't white.

Probably because white people in this country are the folks with the most advantage with regard to race. If they're interested in letting other minorities in at their meeting, it's not my place to disagree."

"We were on our way to Flordia to check out a car, its a pretty long ride so I asked my two buddies if they wanted to come along. It always helps to have extra drivers on long road trips. They agreed and we were all set to go. When I told my girlfriend what we were doing she insisted on going. We made the trip down in record time, despite loosing the front brake pads in Virginia. The car was not in as good of shape as it looked in the pictures, so I decided against it. We started the long drive back after getting some food. We were about 3 hours into the trip home.  She was always a bit of nympho so I was not too surprised when she threw a blanket over me and we started going at it. My buddies in front seats got real quiet but I thought we might have gotten away with. Several years later I was talking with one of my buddies and I said ""You remember that road trip to Flordia?"" He laughed and said ""yep"", ""Did you know.."" and before i could finish the sentence he said ""Yes! We knew what the hell you two were doing back there""."

"I completely agree with choosing whether or not you want to have children, but the argument you used is not comparable.

A bear isn't naturally made to rip off the face of a Human. It's engineered to protect itself, its territory and its young, and also to hunt if needs be. Bears don't go out purposefully into cities looking for Humans to rip to shreds. 

You're using something that something else was made/built for to detract from something that you were made/built for.

You're comparing apples to oranges here. Completely different situations and purposes. The only thing linking them is what they were ""naturally made for"", but one argument does not detract from the other. 

What the person was saying is that it's a Human *purpose* to have children. In order for your argument to be valid, it would also have to be a widely accepted Human purpose to have your face torn off by a bear. That, of course, does not come naturally to us. "

But hey, let's go with your anecdotal interpretation.  

I've been told all my life that wisdom comes with age and to respect elders.  The older I get, the more I continue to realize how wrong that is.  You counter facts and evidence with personal anecdotes.  the defining difference isn't between age and experience, but between people who respect statistics, facts and the scientific method, and those who go off of feeling, passion and personal anecdotes.  

While I appreciated the interesting tale you told, every single evidence for the conclusion you've made has been personal anecdote.  You clearly fall into the latter group of people.

"I have a Masters Degree in Theology. I studied Islam. So do not tell me I did not.

Also, I am quite fascinated by the idea that whatever my problem is with Islam, I can then apply that unilaterally to every other religion. At the basis of that idea is the very naïve assumption that all religions are the same. They are not.

The Bible and the Qur'an are read very differently by their respective followers. The Bible contains historical accounts, poetry, prophecy, and so on and so forth. But Christians acknowledge that these are the words of man. The Qur'an is the dictated word of God. It came straight from his mouth (according to Islam). Having that knowledge gives you an immediate awareness of how differently the Bible and the Qur'an will be interpreted by their respective readers. Your point lacks depth.

If you hadn't noticed, we already have a full blown race war. Islam is founded on one. We are the infidels. Islam has no tolerance for us or our beliefs. Islam began with Muhammad and his followers raising up an army from Medina and ravaging Mecca to declare his revelation. Ever since, such acts of violence have been the watermark of Islam. That was 1,400 years ago. This has nothing to do with the Iraq war.

Now, I will willingly debate with anyone about anything. But please do not approach a reasonable debate with ""I am calling you the fuck out."" I'm up for a discussion. I'm not up for a ""my dick is bigger than yours"" shouting contest."

through my life, i have seen technology save lives and bring us closer to one another than ever before. arguments making emotions/empathy antithetical to logic/technology are dated and simplistic."

The goal is to create such an environment where it will be insanely easy to radicalize people.

If you attribute real life sides to the two people being spoken too in this video it really hits home about what is happening.  Some of the transcript is below and it really hits home

The Doctor: You just want cruelty to beget cruelty. You're not superior to people who were cruel to you. You're just a whole bunch of new cruel people. A whole bunch of new cruel people, being cruel to some other people, who'll end up being cruel to you. The only way anyone can live in peace is if they're prepared to forgive. Why don't you break the cycle?
Bonnie: Why should we?
The Doctor: What is it that you actually want?

Bonnie: War.
The Doctor: Ah. And when this war is over, when -- when you have the homeland free from humans, what do you think it's going to be like? Do you know? Have you thought about it? Have you given it any consideration? Because you're very close to getting what you want. What's it going to be like? Paint me a picture. Are you going to live in houses? Do you want people to go to work? What'll be holidays? Oh! Will there be music? Do you think people will be allowed to play violins? Who will make the violins? Well? Oh, You don't actually know, do you? Because, just like every other tantruming child in history, Bonnie, you don't actually know what you want. So, let me ask you a question about this brave new world of yours. When you've killed all the bad guys, and it's all perfect and just and fair, when you have finally got it exactly the way you want it, what are you going to do with the people like you? The troublemakers. How are you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one?

Bonnie: We'll win.

Doctor: Oh, will you? Well maybe -- maybe you will win. But nobody wins for long. The wheel just keepts turning. So, come on. Break the cycle.

Bonnie: Then why are you still talking?
The Doctor: Because I'm trying to get you to see. And I'm almost there.

Bonnie: Do you know what I see, Doctor? A box. A box with everything I need. A 50% chance.

Kate: For us, too.
[The Doctor sighs.]

The Doctor: And we're off! Fingers on buzzers! Are you feeling lucky? Are you ready to play the game? Who's going to be quickest? Who's going to be the luckiest?
Kate: This is not a game!
The Doctor: No, it's not a game, sweetheart, and I mean that most sincerely.
Bonnie: Why are you doing this?
Kate: Yes, I'd like to know that too. You set this up -- why?
The Doctor: Because it's not a game, Kate. This is a scale model of war. Every war ever fought right there in front of you. Because it's always the same. When you fire that first shot, no matter how right you feel, you have no idea who's going to die. You don't know who's children are going to scream and burn. How many hearts will be broken! How many lives shattered! How much blood will spill until everybody does what they're always going to have to do from the very beginning -- sit down and talk! Listen to me, listen. I just -- I just want you to think. Do you know what thinking is? It's just a fancy word for changing your mind.

Bonnie: I will not change my mind.

The Doctor: Then you will die stupid. Alternatively, you could step away from that box. You could walk right out of that door, and you could stand your revolution down.

Bonnie: No, I'm not stopping this, Doctor. I started it. I will not stop it. You think they'll let me go after what I've done?

The Doctor: You're all the same, you screaming kids, you know that? ""Look at me, I'm unforgivable."" Well here's the unforeseeable, I forgive you. After all you've done. I forgive you.
Bonnie: You don't understand. You will never understand.
The Doctor: I don't understand? Are you kidding? Me? Of course I understand. I mean, do you call this a war, this funny little thing? This is not a war. I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know. I did worse things than you could ever imagine, and when I close my eyes... I hear more screams than anyone could ever be able to count! And do you know what you do with all that pain? Shall I tell you where you put it? You hold it tight... Til it burns your hand. And you say this -- no one else will ever have to live like this. No one else will ever have to feel this pain. Not on my watch.

&gt; This is an enormous straw man, one intentionally created by anti-feminist groups in order to smear all feminism.

So stating that a small minority (obviously *not representative* of feminism) is responsible is an attempt at smearing *all* feminism? Please check your reading comprehension skills and/or slow yourself down before replying. 

&gt; If your only exposure to feminist ideas is second-hand through TiA or Gamergate, like I believe it has been for a lot of Redditors, you really have no idea what you're talking about.

It definitely isn't and I have a very good idea what I'm talking about. This radical subgroup exists. Sticking your head in the sand and claiming it doesn't will not make them go away. I've already said they aren't exactly a large bunch, just that they're loud and have an excellent echo chamber on the internet. How can you argue with that?

&gt; Feminists have always been huge proponents of helping male rape victims (and in fact feminists were the first to really push for it), are against the custody system (which operates under the assumption that women are caretakers, which feminists hate), and the vast majority of feminists despise the current justice system for its excesses and biases (like most politically active people on the left).

I can't dispute this, all I can say is that I haven't seen it discussed nearly as often as female issues, but I understand well enough that personal experience doesn't count for shit. So, maybe.

&gt; Good news, it's not! Feminism is and has always been about equality for the genders. It's just that women have historically and still do suffer more from sexism than men, and so the movement took up their cause.

I know. My point is, the word 'feminism' is misinterpreted a lot. It made a lot of sense to call it that during the early suffrage movement but I think it's a misnomer for the 21st century that just leads to misunderstandings

In case it wasn't clear, I support feminism completely. I think anyone who understands what it's about and isn't a complete tool does. It makes a lot of sense. What I don't support is false information and disregard of issues. Feminism's biggest problem right now is PR related, and the root cause of it are the nutcases."

I posted this a while back, but I used to work for a local grocery chain, and I was in the deli department. Once a week, this ridiculously attractive Chinese woman, early twenties would get a giant paper bucket if fried chiken and the sauces. She would carry it over to the store's parking garage, and disappear out of the store. One day I got my break after sho got her food, so on my way to my car, I got a soda from the soda machine, and walked towards my car, which was a few spaces away from hers. I motice her car was rocking side-to-side, and looked in to see her ass-naked, covered in ranch dressing, honey bbq sauce, and whatever other sauces, plus the fried chicken, and she was furiously masturbating, using the bone of a drumstick as a dildo. She didn't stop once ai looked in,nshe just kept going, orgasm after sauce-covered orgasm, and was shaking her whole car the whole time. I was both aroused and horrified, but still mostly horrified. She then pulled the chicken leg she was using as a dildo and ate the meat off of it, and proceeded to use another drumstick leg to keep fucking herself pull of chicken and gross ass sauces. If I hadn't looked back a third time, I would not have seen the fact that the seats in her car had a cloth interior."

"The long dusty roads of Middle America.

RV trip with grandparents, brother, and two cousins when we were all 10-16 years old. You might expect there to be some friction between two boys and two girls in the throes of their own personal pubescence freakshow, but boy did we over perform.

The stories vary. But the worst were the days driving through flat boring Ohio. St Louis was cool. Then it was to Oklahoma. God damn the highways between those two cities are boring. The RV camps were mostly gnarly. OKC was... uh... boring. We had family with us and our touristy crap was limited by the fact that it was hot as shit and us kids hated each other by then.

Down, I guess through Texas a little? We passed through Texarkana. Good god was that a tourist trap... except the appeal was even more minimal than most. Woohoo we are in two states. There's literally nothing here except a border! Sweet!

Then we drove across to North Carolina then back up Northeast. Those legs weren't so bad. Visited colleges, saw the Biltmore Estate, visited family near Philly.

I would never do a road trip through 80% of the states we drove through. They were the worst of American excess - big cars, bigger trucks, nasty gas stations, nastier public showers in the camps. Bad people, worse food."

"That's all in your head babe. Men make completely separate judgements when it comes to attractiveness and social value. But not only that, we actually assume you're dumber if you're hotter and smarter and more competent if you're not as attractive. In general we assign more ""worth"" in the social and professional sense to less attractive women. We only assign high *sexual* value if you're very attractive. But being all dolled up is more likely to get what you say discounted and ignored. And not because of sexism, because we learn growing up that hot girls *usually are dumber* than not as attractive girls and they usually have very little of value to say compared to their less attractive counterparts. In fact this is true so often that super hot girls are seen as the absolute lowest point on the (non disabled) intellectual ladder and Hermione like girls are seen as *smarter than most of us guys*. Like, it's a statistically supported generality. It's a fact of nature. Partially because the hot girls have everything done for them and don't have to think or speak so they never learn to; and partly because the not as attractive girls know they're gonna have to work hard in this life. And it's much harder on unattractive girls because unlike guys they can't make up for being dumb by being strong and athletic or domineering and confident. They HAVE to be smart because it's the only possible tool they've got besides going the SJW route. So we often see them as some of the smartest people around. They also generally are too. "

Now they aren't attacking out of fanatism, they are attacking out of hatred and revenge.

1. Get leaders that stop messing with others, and defend your country (DEFEND, not ""preemptively defend"").

2. Elect war hawks, and completely annihilate them, wipe them all out, embrace genocide and nukes, and kill every single last one of them.

"&gt; No, not exactly. You're claiming that the vocal minority has ""hijacked"" feminism, which leads to the problem.

Eh, perhaps that was the wrong word. What I meant to say was that this is the brand of feminism people hear most about nowadays and the inevitable associations people make causes a bad taste in their mouth whenever they hear 'feminism'.

&gt; The fact that people believe that feminism is currently being dominated by nutcases

Obviously this is a trending belief, but I hope I didn't come off as one of these people. I was talking about perception.

&gt; They (the radical fringe) don't have an echo chamber. Other people (who disagree with all feminisms) are supplying them with an echo chamber in order to advance their own agenda. 

That just seems a bit too convenient. Perhaps there's some truth to it but I'm not going to take this conspiracy-esque statement at face value. Sorry. I can't imagine a pencil pusher sitting at his desk trying to steer Twitter hashtags and tumblr trends in a certain direction. 

&gt; Here's the thing: all the complaints you are making about feminism's ""PR-related"" problems go back  to the very beginning  of anti-feminism . Early anti-feminists echoed the same complaints about feminists that you are saying is the recent outcome of ""nutcases"". 

I don't think this is 100% a valid comparison. There's a big difference between ridiculing an up-and-coming radical movement (for its time) while it's taking off and criticizing new ideas in an established and respected movement. One is born out of emotional prejudice and wanting to stick to the status quo, the other out of rational disagreement. Every movement gets ridiculed when it first pops up.

&gt; The issue is not the fringe, it's the people exploiting the existence of the fringe to manipulate opinions.

What's the alternative, ignore the fringe? Those ideas are ridiculous and they deserve every ounce of criticism flung their way. On top of that, not criticizing them opens up another can of worms entirely: that those ideas are acceptable and that there's nothing wrong with them. And where might that eventually lead?

Cars are designed with a specific purpose - to take someone from point A to point B.
Guns are designed also with a specific purpose - to kill.
Cars, in the act of fulfilling their purpose, do kill people. So do you know what people did when that became a thing? The changed laws to make them safer. You now need a license; you need to take driving tests, you need safety equipment (seat belts etc); there are speed limits.
People get slaughtered all the fucking time with guns, and the gun lobby refuses to allow any *discussion* on how to make your country safer. It is fucking mind boggling.

They don't organize and provide community outreach.

They don't give anything at all. They don't state any facts unless it is directed away from themselves, mainly at white people. 

BLM is really a group of people preaching hate and division in response to hate and division. I agree with their sentiment but I feel their lack of organization and perpetuation of the stereotypical ""ill -behaved black person"" far outweighs what they're accomplishing. 

It's really more like, ""Black Lives Matter (in the context of police shootings, but not if we kill each other and further destroy our community)"""

"Black people aren't BLM and vice versa. We're discussing the movement/organization itself. 

I never said it was impossible or difficult to care about more than one thing at a time, quite the contrary I would argue. 

I'm saying that as much as it sucks, if BLM doesn't validate themselves with some semblance of perceived, strategic plan of action, they will not be successful in their fight and will not win the hearts of the majority of the American population. A movement must focus on PR as much as they focus on the objective itself, or it will collapse from the outside in. So far, they aren't doing so well. "

"Reparations wont change the fact that you as a Black man make up 7% of the country but commit 33% of rape, 56% of armed robbery, 52% of murder, and 42% of murder of police officers. 

Reparations wont change the fact that you as a black man are 18.5 times more likely to kill a police officer than a white person despite the fact there are around 9 times as many white people in the country. 

Reparations wont change the fact that for the last 30 years Blacks have committed half of the nations murder. 

Reparations wont change the fact that the murder rate in Chicago this year is up 72% and almost 2000 people have been shot. 

Reparations wont change the fact that the Black community has engrossed itself in a culture of crime, drugs and single mothers. 

Reparations wont change the fact that the death toll in Chicago from 2001 to 2016 is higher than that of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. 

Reparations wont change the fact that it would take cops 40 years to kill as many black men as have died at the hands of other black men.

You are treated differently by police because for years the black community has been such as disgusting bed of violence and despair. It is not White peoples fault that Blacks commit crime. It is not White peoples fault that your communities survive only on welfare and would crash into starvation and third worldliness without government assistance. 

The fact you believe the Republican party survives only by ""dog whistle lines about how my kind is lazy freeloaders"" shows how ignorant you are.

"Well it is called a ""fair tax"" because it is exactly that - fair. Your taxes will be based on how much you spend, not how much you make.. 
&gt; Sure, it would heavily alleviate the tax burden on paper, but nearly all of those benefits would go to those who don't need them, while straining most of the social safety net, and shifting most of the remaining tax burden onto the poor.


It isn't up to us to decide who does or does not *need* the benefits of income tax. My sister once got mad at me for not giving money to a ""homeless"" man on the street and her reasoning was literally ""well you don't need it"".. Because I make a decent amount of money. But it isn't up to her or anyone else to decide what I do or don't need. If I had millions of extra dollars that I earned, I should be able to light it on fire in my backyard if I want to. Sure, that'd make me a shit human being but it's my money to do with as I please, not for anyone else to decide what I should do with it ""because I don't need it"".

As far as basic necessities go, I'm just going to copy and paste an explanation I read elsewhere: ""Under the FairTax, we do not believe that anyone, rich or poor, should have to pay taxes on the essentials of life.  In other words, under the FairTax, people take care of themselves and their families first, and then, with whatever is left over, they contribute a portion to fund the necessary services of government.  
The mechanism to accomplish this is pretty simple.  Each year, the Department of Health and Human Services calculates the costs of purchasing the minimum goods and services necessary to support a basic existance.  This cost, know as the Poverty Level, is then used as the basis from which the prebate is calculated.  
Since we do not believe anyone should pay taxes on the bare essentials, the FairTax rate is applied to the Poverty Level to get the annual prebate for individuals and families, and then that amount is returned to registered individuals and families in twelve monthly installments over the year.  
And because the FairTax believes in treating everyone fairly and eqally, the prebate is available to everyone, regardless of income level.  The only stipulation is that the person or family be living in the country legally."""

A knife tip, should you apply enough force, would work, though obviously it'd very very quickly fail, even in one hit.  All the carbide does is allow more than one hit as tungsten carbide is one of the hardest materials known to man, it's not some magical anti glass material.

"I personally like the current system for the most part.

The wage issue is a minimum wage issue, not something specific to servers. 

I like that our servers work as hard as they do, and if they dont it'll be shown later.

Its also nice for certain places/servers because they can make FAR better pay that way.

The one downside is that places that dont draw in a lot of business, aren't going to make much. But, that'd most likely be true even if they were required to  pay more than minimum wage.

"Here's the inherent problem. For every 1 story of the Prophet being violent there are 10 where he isn't. This is because these stories were created by early Muslims who lived over 100 years after the Prophet's death.

Religion isn't about worshipping who the person actually was (did Jesus actually come back to life 3 days after his death? No) but about the lessons the stories tell us (in Christianity it's about God's eternal love and how forgiveness through reconciliation both religiously and with your community is always an option). Was Muhammad a Paragon of Virtue in reality? Absolutely not. Was he a mass murdering pedo? Also probably not. There are too many sources of non-Muslims being treated very well in very early Muslim communities for us to believe Muhammad wanted every non-Muslim killed.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that if I want to believe Muhammad was the epitome of virtue, I totally can. However, if I want to believe his actions justify murder of non-believers, I can also do that solely because of the writings of people that came much later than Muhammad's life. People who choose the latter are either messed up themselves (due to a number of reasons, socioeconomic, cultural, or otherwise) or are seduced to that message by the recruiters of extremist groups. How one practices Islam is influenced more than most think by the culture they grow up in.

Disclaimer: I was raised Catholic but am now an atheist."

"I'd definitely say the distinction is still extremely relevant. With non-GMO foods the only new genes that can be introduced into the offspring are genes (with the possibility of minor mutations) that already exist within that organism's genome. GMOs, on the other hand, often have genes inserted into to them that do not belong to the species and would never arise in that organism through simple crossbreeding.

You are right, on the molecular level, adding a few genes to the genome doesn't introduce any new or dangerous compounds as its only adding a new sequence of base pairs. But, the organism also gains the blueprints for an entirely new protein that probably came from an entirely different species. This new protein present in the organism, not the actual addition of the DNA, is what people worry about in genome modification. "

But aren’t police are here to protect us!?

Not so much. A situation in NYC, in which a non-badge wearing man subdued a knife-wielding killer, while badge-wearing individuals looked on, underscores this fact.

From the article City Argues NYPD Had No “Special Duty” To Protect Subway Hero From Madman’s Rampage, reposted below in its entirety:

When the news was brought to my attention that police had an opportunity to intervene and maybe prevent the whole incident, and it was explained to me they chose to stay in the motorman’s compartment instead of coming out, I was very upset.

Lozito sued for negligence, but city lawyers say his demand for unspecified money damages should be tossed because the police had no “special duty” to protect him or any individual on the train that day

The word wasn't considered a proper contraction that long ago and wasn't in the dictionary.   Retroactively applying rules for proper contractions seems to make sense but they were not originally applicable as *no form* of the contraction was considered proper English.

My answer would be that I think there two types of incest- one is between adults who are related and one is between an adult and child. I think sometimes we lump them together. The second is rape no matter what so that's that. But the first, I think it stems from a lot of stuff. I don't think it's healthy to have kids that way but then why couldn't related people just have sex and not kids? Yeah I don't know about that. But that is a deeper issue.

You can argue that it's stupid and counter-productive, and it is, but when you're outside the mainstream and oppressed and frustrated and filled with bitterness and just plain old all messed up inside doing the 'smart thing' or the 'right thing' isn't on your radar."
"I mean, even if they thought it was the 'two chimps pop out human baby' scenario, I couldn't be with them.

"Gun registration- Gun owners are required to license their weapons exactly like automobiles.  Allows law enforcement to trace the owner of a weapon.  
Universal background check- A gun buyer is required to prove he/she is legally allowed to purchase a gun.  
Record transfer of ownership- A gun purchase must be registered in order to verify who is the legal owner of a weapon.  Again, exactly like a car.  

Together, these three laws would drastically reduce the number of illegal weapons getting into criminal hands.  As it is, about 85% of criminally held weapons were from LEGAL gun ownership (straw purchases, cutout buyers, private/gunshow sales).  

By creating a paper trail for a gun's ownership history, there is a much higher responsibility on those buying and selling weapons.  A gun used in a crime could be traced through the initial purchase through the end user.  If a gun was sold illegally (no background check/no transfer of ownership/no report of the weapon being lost or stolen), then the last registered owner of that weapon would be a starting place for the police to investigate a gun crime.  

In addition, there are laws in place that prevent any collection of gun registration information, prevent any gun ownership data from being placed in a database (resulting in a mass of PAPER records that must be searched), immunity for gun manufacturers from ANY product liability lawsuits, prevention of ANY federal government funds from being used in ANY research related to gun violence, and a lack of a NATIONAL database of persons who cannot own a weapon.  A registry is useless if you can hop a state line and magically get your gun, because records are not shared between states.  "
"Except that MLK was around during a periodic of actual systemic racism with the Jim Crow laws when they were fighting for equal rights. BLM is a complete joke, founded by a white guy, Shaun King, to exploit blacks and make money off of them, one of their listed inspirations is Assata Shakur was a convicted cop killer and currently still wanted by the FBI. They demand the death of cops from isolated instances of killing of unarmed blacks, when over twice as many unarmed whites are killed by cops every year. There are problems of police brutality but it is not racially exclusive. BLM doesnt address the most pertinent issue in the black community which is black on black crime and until they actually do something towards that instead of using white police as the convenient scapegoat for problems in the black community, I'll continue to think of them as a joke "
"No, you only want information that supports the legalization of marijuana."
"I mean it's usually really obvious guys.  Like me and the guys went out to hit the clubs last night and the first one we hit was literally all black girls which I'm just not into but ya know, they(women interested in you in general) gravitate towards you, move wherever you are going, get all nervous and play with their hair and shit and you basically gotta act like you've never even HEARD of sex and these interactions are entirely foreign to you.

Like I said ""clark kenting"" you can't dance (which isn't true I'm a DJ and former stripper), you're always in a book/your phone, I was reading fucking twitter while giant asses were being shook inches away from me, ""I don't go out a lot"" just being quiet &amp; awkward silences, ect...but even worse it could turn them on more but we ended up leaving that club.  the girls were too thick for my tastes.

So we hit the next one which is more my speed, electronic, blondes.  There was this one blonde in VIP hottest girl in the club, and a doctor which is incredibly useful to recruit for an app I'm working on that brought me right out of Clark Kenting to my usual Christian Grey self but ya know you don't just go up and talk to the girl especially when she's the hottest girl in the club every guy is getting at you gotta mingle &amp; and amp up our presence first so ya know you make sure she sees you dancing on the dance floor, other girls laughing at your jokes and shit having a good time but because they are basically props you shut them down with the clark kent ""oh ya know I really just came out here with my mates tonight to dance but cheers love"" and you can refresh and hit it with someone else.

process repeats until I've networked my way into her network once I was with her THEN I can stop hiding my power level, don't let her think she's sealed the deal because dick is like an ebay auction, you keep checking up on it as long as the bidding is ongoing even though she pretty much secured the dick from the time I came in I can't let her KNOW that.

She was a freak and a cl;osetr nerd too and it was cool because it was like ""it's ok your among friends here"" this is my anime and japanese sex toy room put on that VR headset, try these beads I'll grab the hitachi and rope""

The moral of the story is: guys need to know this shit because when you learn these signals, how to read them, how much girls really want dick and the power of it, you can make women work for you.  Been doing it for years.  I don't know how to get you there, there's really no guide besides getting out there and doing it like I have since the skaing rink as a kid but it's a heck of a ride.

In the case of someone like myself if I remotely give a shit I've already started moves, if I don't I guess if you throw the pussy at me and I don't have anything better to do and nobody has to know I'll hit it if I don't have to go too far for it or spend any money."

"Then again, there are lesser evils than rape and murder. Those who write their own rules, adjusting them as they go along, would naturally be more inclined to indulge in them when it suits their purpose. 

Edit: Okaaay, this ought to have been pretty self-evident, but apparently not. So I'll give an example: say I believe lying is wrong, but only according to my own observations, experiences and opinions. I believe it to be a lesser evil than rape and murder, but still wrong. Then one day I find myself in a situation where to tell a simple and easy lie will keep me from losing my job- do I still think it would be wrong to lie? Maybe, but is it wrong enough to avoid at the expense of my own self-interest? Suddenly, the observations, experiences and opinions on which I base my beliefs have shifted, and since it is those by which I arbitrate my own moral standards, I can reason with myself that it's worth it- even OK- to lie in order keep my job (or to keep my family from falling into financial crisis, to contribute to the economy etc. etc. whatever). Per my own self-interest, I decide that it's not wrong for *me* to lie, in this instance, after all. Not wrong enough NOT to indulge in it. 

If, on the other hand, you have someone who ascribes to a set of *objective* beliefs that *dictates* ""lying is ALWAYS wrong, no matter what the scenario, and to do so will always incur consequences."" I won't say they won't do it anyway- maybe they succumb to temptation of self-preservation, maybe not. Clearly though, this person has far more incentive NOT to indulge in this ""lesser evil"" even at the expense of his immediate self-interest. 

Objective vs. Subjective: subjective beliefs are much more malleable, they often enable us to commit offenses against others (pretend, in the hypothetical, someone else was blamed for what I lied about, and lost their job with or without my ever knowing about it) all the time and still think of ourselves as ""good"" people. It's interesting- and telling- how hard-pressed we are to accept such a simple fact of human nature.

For the record, I do not subscribe to a religion or set of objective beliefs. But I recognize the above, I try to keep it in mind. Having rejected religious dogma, I attempt to hold myself to SOME objective standards to prevent myself justifying whatever the hell I want given the circumstances. People who *refuse* to recognize the inherently self-serving nature of subjective morality are the kind of shitty people who go to sleep at night believing they are ""good"" people- better people, even- because they don't expect a posthumous reward (conveniently ignoring the fact that their ""morality"" is, on the whole, dictated by self-interest. That's just a fact of human psychology, that human behavior is primarily all ABOUT seeking reward- just during our lifetime. But maybe that's going too ""deep"" for a reddit circle-jerk; ever hear of a thing called operant conditioning?) Anyway, those who puff-themselves up otherwise are basically full of shit."

"The subway is fine. The buses and the commuter trains otoh look like what we had in the 50s. Uncomfortable, very poorly indicated (when I was there they had moved around all bus stops in Manhattan a few months before but hadn't updated their signs and fliers), with an archaic ticket system, dirty, terribly slow. Penn station is literally the worst station I've ever seen, and the only one where I ever missed a train because I couldn't find the platform.

So what you're saying is that most poor people are black? That in the low income area of those cities they're primarily full of black people? Where do the Latino poor go? Is there a different low income part of the city reserved of them? Seeing that AAs make up 12% of the population in America your opinion seems to be more bias than fact.

Many people who benefitted from slavery stood for keeping slavery intact, but they themselves where not going to be slaves. The Americans who were slaves were not standing up for slavery. "

My girlfriend slapped me a lot, but only *because* it was harmless. According to this study's definition of ""domestic abuse"", I was pretty heavily abused. My whole point is to unpack the definitions that this study is using so that people don't get the wrong idea from the claim that ""women commit more domestic violence than men do"".

"But the entire point of the nutrition/obesity discussion is to understand why people are getting fat. No one is talking about this because theyre deeply suspcious of conservation of energy. Take that as a trivial axiom, no one is interested in arguing about it. And that's all thermo contributes to this subject.

 The (non trivial/interesting/important) part of the problem is to understand what happens to the unburned calories. There are two possible places they can go, and you cannot simply assume that they all go to fat. They don't, you can do the math on that pretty easily. So why do some people store a larger portion of their unburnt calories than others do? That is the question that needs an answer, and it's not a question thermo can help you answer.

May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs. You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus.
And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have to us who think and reason? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake? You are a waste of flesh.
You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed , drooling meatslapper. You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on.
This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while.

True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering.

It just wouldn't have been ""right"". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.
You're an idiot. A moron of the highest order. You're so stupid it's a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath. Intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon. Creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you. If you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out. On an intelligence scale of 1 to 10 (10 corresponding to the highest attainable IQ) you're rating is so far into negative numbers that one would need to travel into another quantum reality in order to even catch a distant glimpse of it.
Your personality is that of a rabid Chihuahua intent on destroying its own tail. Your powers of observation are akin to those of the bird that keeps slamming into the picture window trying to get that other bird it keeps seeing. You are walking, talking proof that you don't have to be sentient to survive, and that Barnum was thinking of you when he uttered his immortal phrase regarding the birth of a sucker. You are, at varying times, tedious, boring, and even occasionally earth shatteringly hilarious in your idiocy, routinely childish, moronic, pathetic, wretched, disgusting and pitiful.
You are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value. If God ever decides to give the planet an enema you'd better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for The Insertion. There is no animal so disgusting, so vile that it deserves comparison to you, for even the lowest, dirtiest, most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche. You fill no niche. To call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species. You are worse than vermin, for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not. You are truly human garbage. You are a fraudulent, lying, predatory charlatan. You are of less worth than a burnt-out light bulb. You will forever live in shame.
You have nothing to say, and Godwin's Law does not apply when writing about you. You are the anti-Midas, for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable. Mothers gather their children close when you appear. You are an aberration, a corruption, and a boil that needs to be lanced. You are a poison in need of being vomited. You are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body. You are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet.
I don't like you. I don't like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do. Go away, you swine. You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon. You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. Meaningful to no one, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I wretch at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, and the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell? Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are a waste of flesh. On a good day you're a halfwit. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, study, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ""normal"" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. It just wouldn't have been ""right"".

People have been murdered for no reason at all. Does that make the crime less terrible? Is it really worse to kill somebody because they are gay than to kill somebody just for the fun of it?

Your attitude is what is wrong with America. If you want harmony in race relations, you can not focus and obsess on race. It must be essentially a non issue. If you want to normalize homosexuality, you need to treat it like it is normal. You are acting like being straight is normal. You need to get it in your head that being gay is also normal, and therefore there is no difference between a gay and a straight person being killed. It is murder. The reason does not matter. That is such a disgusting line of thought, it would be so horribly offensive to the family members of a murder victim to hear you talk about motives like it is nothing. ""No one has been murdered for being straight"". Bullshit. I guarantee you it has happened. 

I would bet you money that a gay person or any person has killed another human being because they were straight. Guaranteed. People kill for all sorts of reasons, and some reasons are not better than others. That is sick. Think about what you are trying to say here. Think about how you are treating other human beings who identify as homosexual. You are acting like they are different humans from straight people. You don't see what is wrong with that?"

"Precisely, why are you tell me about personal relationships when we're simply talking about one subject - reality TV. You're conflating different things. Are you a cook or a marriage councillor? 

It is a fraud. The enterprise is essentially non-existant. It's just entertainment. Those making the tv show get a quick return and fuck off. They pay a little money to the peons they record, or maybe a bit more if those people are more reknowned, have better lawyers to write better contracts etc. Peons watching it think they can get a cut, so some of them become further pawns in the game. The cycle continues. The only people who make anything out of it in the long run are those making the programmes. 

Even Ramsey is a pawn in it. He's just a figurehead for the people behind the programme. In ten years time it'll just be some other mouth piece being really nice, or being a bit of a dick, or being an ultimate dick doing the exact same thing, until the audience is bored and something else can be created to shock or entertain.

"&gt; . There are people out there who will try to hurt you and others that can only be stopped by the threat of or the use of violence, up to and including lethal violence.

On the other hand you can try building a more civilised society where such violence does not occur or is lessened. I know at this point there is absolutely no point in talking gun logic with an American gun supporter, it is too ingrained in them

But do you really believe most people in most countries are cowards because they do not want killing machines? They do not care for their families, their property, their safety? Of course they do. However, they believe killing machines are definitely not the answer

I am from a third world country where robberies and home invasions are common. I know people whose home have been broken into. But i over 30+ years of my life, I have never heard of a single life lost in those robberies and the chief reason has been no guns

You have been watching too many cowboy movies with yourself as the heroes and watched too much NRA propoganda and that is why you believe you are a superhero just because you have a killing machine in your hand. However, reality is not fantasy and killing machines bring just fantasies. 

There is a reason despite billions being invested in weapons in US and the NRA, real life examples of successful gun defences are very, very low and the instances of guns bringing misery and sadness are much higher. I know I will be downvoted, the reddit gun fantasy and the American gun fantasy is simply too huge here

And of course, when Billions are spend by the NRA on propaganda it is no different than a brainwashed cult who refuse to see logic. Guns ARE important for safety BECAUSE you have been fed that since childhood just like a radical Islamist or Catholic might be spoonfed how religion is important for salvation and gays are abominations. No logic can trump stuff fed from childhood. There is a reason ONLY in America where NRA is so huge people believe so much in guns and in NO other country. Well, might be a coincidence right?"

&gt;Complaints of all Crime Index offenses made to law
enforcement agencies which are found to be false or baseless
can be “unfounded” and excluded from crime counts. A higher
percentage of complaints of forcible rape are determined “unfounded,”
or found by investigation to be false, than for any
other Index crime. **While the average of “unfounded” rates for
all Crime Index offenses was 2 percent in 1997, 8 percent of
forcible rape complaints were “unfounded” for the same
timeframe.**

Here in the U.S. you run into people who look the same, speak the same language, but have totally different views. If you try and talk calmly to a Somalian (which where I live, we have a lot of.) they get offended and you make the situation worse. They want to scream in your face and have you scream back in their face because that is how ""Men talk"" in their culture.

I can give a crapload more examples. But I think you get the pont. For certain groups of people, you need a whole new set of jedi mind tricks. In the UK you probably only need a few different sets.

"#SPOILERS!!!#

This movie, I have a lot to say about this movie. I love the beginning. The weirdness of it is just great. The music is phenomenal. The opening fight scene is awesome. It's just the right amount of weird to think you're getting into some cool hipster movie that you can talk about and be a tool.

But then it just turns into a fucking normal movie. They do the conditioning, and all the references you've seen over the years finally make sense, and that's it. No more weird milk drinking, no more cool intro music. He meets the guy whose wife he raped in the  beginning, then tortures him with Beethoven (a truly unfortunate situation). Then he's in the hospital, and they treat him, and you can see that he's back to his old sadistic ways. Eventually the guy meets two of his old friends and they nearly drown him just for revenge. Dick move IMO.

I guess you could say the movie is about retribution and punishment. Maybe it's saying that the wild life isn't the wisest choice for a young person. I don't know. I was just disappointed. I thought the whole movie would be the guy's endeavors with his band of merry hooligans and they would freely rape and save girls from rape indiscriminately.

Evidence based decision making is really important.  I'm totally okay with spirituality.  My problem is with people who say something like ""I'm not sure about the origin and purpose of life therefore this exact specific religious doctrine is true.  Oh and by the way every other specific religious doctrine is definitely wrong.""  Most religious people follow the doctrine that they were born into.  How can that be what a benevolent God wants?  Approximately 27,000 children die every day?  If they weren't born into the right religion they're going to be punished by eternal damnation.

Institutional racism is a side affect of bias created through years of people in policing and judging communities seeing black youth commit the majority of crime. 

We can argue all day about what causes them to be in a position to commit these crimes, but they're still doing it. You have to take responsibility for yourself, and your own community before pointing fingers and trying to gun down innocent police in the streets over a dude who was reaching for a gun in his pocket while resisting his arrest.

You (or anybody else) don't absolutely know that for sure. While it is problematic to talk science in terms of purpose (though biologists find it a useful shorthand), life in general can be said to be greater than science.

Take literature (the humanities in general) for example. They investigate the human condition, and not through the scope of magnifying lenses and whatnot. You can't possibly say that the way they go about it is invalid, or totally wrong. 

With the sciences, I agree that talking purpose is problematic (ask the biologists). But with life in general, all of us can agree there's more to it than science.

If women were smart they'd get married at 20, have their kids then and by the time they are in their 30's the kids are all in school and she can go to college for 8 hours a day. 

By the time they are graduating high school she is starting her career and NO ONE is going to bother to ask her about her reproductive plans because it's going to be obvious she's gotten all that stuff done already. 

And what will she have lost by waiting 10 to 15 years to start her career? At 35 she can expect to work another 35 years uninterrupted if she wants to.

It really bothers me that women at once say, ""I'm just as good as a man and can do anything that men can do"", and then turn around and say, ""I need to get more time off than my male co-workers because I want to take care of my kids, and also, I have a period once a month, and also my boyfriend wants to take mt to Cabo, and . . . etc. etc."""

I think you should reread the post. I take my liberty to not debate racist. 
"Well if you want to discuss the basis for my statement that's one thing, if you and ""others"" simply want to dismiss it and feel good about yourselves, that's fine also. If you want to discuss the matter, you might start with the foundation for your dismissal of my position and the basis of your own. My background includes years of graduate school training in the critical study of religion as the foundation of my statement. No credible academic in the field would use these terms. See for example a standard critical work: [Nietzsche's  On the Geneology of Morals](http://www.inp.uw.edu.pl/mdsie/Political_Thought/GeneologyofMorals.pdf) which - at a broad stroke - critiques the notion that there is a singular entity behind a word, i.e., ""Christianity"" or ""Islam"" - let alone some connection among entities whose essential existence is dubious in the first place. The Buddhists do something similar with their famous ""find the chair-ness"" in any particular chair. A 'chair' is wood, or metal, etc.; consists of parts, has a function - but none of those parts or functions are exclusive to a 'chair'. So in this way, a singular entity called this or that 'person' - me or you - does not exist, either. How much more so for a complex entity such as ""Christianity""?

My question back is: on what basis could you substantiate your contention that 'Judeo-Christian values' exist or that these two separate traditions are related to each other or to Islam?"

"My parents died when I was only a baby. It was a really tragic ordeal, although I never learned too much about it when I was young. Until I was almost a teenager, the adults around me would hush me up saying to forget about my parents.

Anyway, when my parents died I was sent to live with my aunt and uncle. They had a son of their own right around my age, and they made it very clear they liked him much more than me. He was a straight twat, but they couldn't see it because they were blinded by their love for him. Just about every day they would remind me that they were only caring for me out of their ""incredible good will."" That was some crap. I was basically their servant. I even had to live under their stairs for a few years when I was young before they finally let me live in the guest bedroom. It never felt like home though. I would do their chores, cooking and cleaning for them, and besides that they told me to be quiet and make sure they forgot I existed. It really was a miserable childhood.

Well, I never really would forget all of that. It was 7 years ago that I was finally taken away from them, and life has never been better. It was rough at first leaving their home, but now that I finally defeated Voldemort life couldn't be better!"

However, if you really look into history there are more chilling aspects than that to the Nazi genocide of Jews. For example, did you know that the first 'Nazi style' genocide of Jews took place in Switzerland 600 years prior?

The Swiss, in 1349, January 9th, to honor the Roman god of new beginnings, first constructed the genocidal techniques which would be used in Nazi germany, as well as were the primary proponents of Jew hatred all throughout Europe, as well as were the lead profiteers from the 1940s holocaust (aside perhaps some Germans).

In other words, the genocide of European Jews primary lead from the Swiss. In addition, the Knights Hospitaller were headquartered just north of Switzerland. The Roman Catholic Church, who order the Templars to disband and turn over their funds to Hospitaller, was also supportive of Hitler, and it's well known the Knights participated in many annihilations of Muslims, and Jews, alike.

Long story short, the Allies defeated Hitler, in WW2, but the Swiss have gained significant (some would say capital) influence since then, largely rising in the 60s, during the time of mass political assassination, and now control large parts of Western Society, in addition to be the instigative party to the burning / gassing of 6,000,000 Jews.

Today the US operates in a model not terribly unlike Nazi Germany, or other puppets states, to the betterment of the Swiss Economy, which crumbles without periodic genocide or slavery, and thus you have the war against Muslims."

OF COURSE you have value for what you do as well, you just have the added bonus of still being valued even if you don't do anything. Lets say you have 2 robots, 1 made out of literal Trash, and other made out of solid gold. Both robots can work and do awesome stuff, and are valued highly for what they can DO, but if they both suddenly stop working, one still has value, while the other is just trash.

"Absolutely agree, not to mention unfair on those who remain child free."
"I ponder electrons a lot. I wouldn't call it a ""spin"" necessarily, because they move too much to get an accurate description of their motion. But get enough properly arranged atoms together and the electrons as a group will start rotating around them together, creating magnetism. Introduce a material with the right amount of covalent electrons, make it move through the magnetic field, and the electrons running around the magnet charge down the path of your conducting material. 

Then Tesla comes along and discovers that electrons actually prefer being able to go out then return to the source. Transformers are able to manipulate the quantity, speed, force, and frequency of electrons, by making them go through sets of manipulated magnetic fields, and what comes out of ""the secondary"" of the transformer can be calculated to change the nature of the electricity to increase or decrease the electron activity, whichever u need.

In spite of our ability to control and coerce their activities, they're still constantly moving, practically in every direction, if it weren't for the layers upon layers of plastics and other materials the electrons would abandon the path we set for them as quickly as possible.

Recently they discovered that absolute 0 and absolute heat are impossible to achieve because of the constant motion of electrons. Upon approaching either one the electrons of the universe lose their dimensions and flatten and form together into waves without particles. Not an expert on that"

"Not really. All throughout history it has turned out that things we were absolutely sure about beyond reasonable doubt simply weren't true. Not a single piece of knowledge we have about how the universe works has remained constant.  
The only stance a (good) scientist takes is something like ""This theory works pretty damn well, so it is a very good model for our current purposes."" But you should always be open to discarding that idea if it turns out to be wrong. In fact setting out to test that idea thoroughly enough that you might prove it wrong is an essential part of science. It's how progress is made. If you have gone beyond a reasonable doubt in your belief in a theory then you create a mental block for yourself that most likely will hinder making progress in expanding our knowledge."

"&gt;[In a stance rejecting discrimination, a 2009 study for the Department of Labour by the CONSAD Research Corporation concluded, ""it is not possible now, and doubtless will never be possible, to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men differently on socially acceptable bases, and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women."" The conclusion was based largely on a study by Eric Solberg &amp; Teresa Laughlin (1995), who found that ""occupational selection is the primary determinant of the gender wage gap"" (as opposed to discrimination) because ""any measure of earnings that excludes fringe benefits may produce misleading results as to the existence magnitude, consequence, and source of market discrimination."" They found that the average wage rate of females was only 87.4% of the average wage rate of males; whereas, when earnings were measured by their index of total compensation (including fringe benefits), **the average value of the index for females was 96.4% of the average value for males**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap_in_the_United_States#Explaining_the_gender_pay_gap)

Now if you or your partner got their tubes tied, wore condoms and used the pill, it's extremely unlikely that you will get pregnant. But I believe that in the event that you do, you're morally obligated to have the kid and to care for it.

So to answer your question, ""according to me"" you're rolling the dice if you have sex. You could play it safe and never engage in sex, but that's kinda crazy. Then again, so is having a plan to commit suicide in the event of pregnancy. "

"Firstly, that doesn't counter my point at all. My point was that he or she didn't understand the argument that abortion is murder by saying abortions were going to happen regardless of legality. 

Now if you'd like to argue against the hypothetical pro-lifer, he'd say that comparing the number of abortion before and after roe v wade is disingenuous because accessibility to contraception and improved pregnancy health care eliminates many of the abortions preemptively. Also, comparing alcohol consumption to a procedure that requires a licensed medical professional is comparing apples and oranges and irrelevant to discussion. 

Also, hypothetical pro-lifer would point out that you're still ignoring the fact that we are talking about people murdering babies.

"ha .. cronyism is its nadir in industries like movie, finance and other industries which has a significant finance arm. That is because risk is somehow high when it comes to non jews but when it comes to jews they take risk on their own. Notice how most movie stars are jews. It is astounding if any non jew white will even make it that big these days. Forget about minorities. Wall street hedge funds are massively rigged. Anyone with any knowledge about how it functions will truthfully tell you that. Yes there are doctors and engineers but so are there in non  jew whites, asians such as indians and chinese. Point being USA is a capitalistic society. So after one stage all companies are banks and how they manage money. Just like any tech company including google and facebook or oracle can be seen as a law firm since they have a pretty big bench of lawyers. Which brings me to the point that somehow the law industry is also having massive jewish presence. 

Now does this mean that they simply excel or like steve jobs, another somewhat jewish guy says, they are willing to bend rules and move goal posts so that they not only set the field but do it conveniently so that they are at advantage? There is a lot of manipulation when jews enter a competition. Till then  there is purity and you can detect the competitiveness when they enter the scene. I am not anti semite to say this as this represents by and large the general consensus among people who say this in safe conversations. I have had interactions with several jews who get hyper at times and are a bit unpredictable. AT times, I do return the favor and we just end our relationship or friendship. There are also some of them who are good natured and seem to be balanced. 

Also Nobel prize is by and large stupid. You cant award a prize to someone and then another to a different guy within 5 years who essentially disproved the theory of the first guy. In that case, rescind the first prize. "

"I know you guys pay high taxes, not all Americans are ignorant to how other countries work lol. There are lots of Americans who would be ok with paying higher taxes to get more ""free"" stuff, but many others don't want that, so with, again, 320 million people, it's hard to reach an agreement. 

You have to remember that background matters in America because we have a long, long, long history of immigrants who have been actively interested in preserving their culture once they come to the US, and many of us celebrate different backgrounds. You also have to remember that unfortunately we also have a long history of slavery and the systemic oppression of Black Americans. :( As a result, Black Americans have their own rich and often separate culture, and we very much see ourselves and each other through these cultural lenses. We are striving towards equality and it's taking us a long time to get there, but that's just a teensy summary of why we acknowledge that people are black, white, brown instead of ignoring race - we have to acknowledge the historic privilege and struggle, depending on who you are. For the record, we consider people of all backgrounds and colors to be American too - we just acknowledge that different people have different experiences and a lot of us try to interact with people with open eyes and open minds. 

&gt;amount of people doesn't really matter

Do you really think this? You think that dealing with 10 million people in a mainly homogenous cultural setting is the same as dealing with 320 million people in an extremely culturally diverse setting? Did you know that Latino babies now outnumber white babies being born in the US? That's how culturally diverse we are. And I understand that some people are just bad with numbers, but you can understand that 320 million is much much larger than 10 million... right? There are basically 30x more people in the US. Interesting side note: Sweden's economy is the 21st largest in the world (according to what I found on google). California, the US state that I live in, just became the 6th largest economy in the world - and that's just a fraction of the US. If you don't think these numbers are significant, well, I don't know what to say. "

"Because women prefer to have more of a work balance life, and do not put their careers first as often as their male counterparts do. 

Surprise, surprise, its not only just the high earning fields that are dominated by men.  Custodial work/menial labor?  Overwhelmingly male.  Construction/hard labor?  About .3% female.  Police, firefighters, fisherman, loggers, soldiers... anything that involves any danger women overwhelmingly refuse to touch.  Little surprise when its so common to criticize the less successful men about not being more wealthy or educated.  

The truth is, women can't have their cake and eat it to.  You want more pay?  Choose between it and being happy.  Most men never get that choice, its work or be nothing, have nothing, and die alone.  Which is exactly why men dominate the 'less desirable' fields.  For all your work on one side of the equation, you very fundamentally do not understand the incentives of the other."

"&gt; but saying that you think it isn't okay to be transgender somehow doesn't disqualify you from being included in civil discourse. 

This is quite simply not true. As the downvoting my comment received demonstrates, people who hold this same view as me are usually lambasted for daring to go against the accepted view. As for your comment regarding violence and hatred, I do not have hatred towards trans people, nor have I ever shown violence towards one, so please don't be so dramatic in a civilized debate.

My view is quite simply that I, personally (again I know I am in the minority) find it totally wrong that people change their gender. We are born as either a male or female and I, personally, think it wrong to attempt to change this using a surgeons skills.

I hate the way that transgenderism is being normalized to such an extent that any criticism of the concept or its practitioners is simply not tolerated at all. Anybody who dares hold this view is slammed as a bigot.

Since gender is supposedly just about feelings instead of biology, transgender logic would allow any man to claim he is a woman and waltz into a women's locker room. There is no requirement that he pass for a female, nor is there a requirement that his ""feeling"" be permanent."

"A number of these links have no direct links to the data that they reference, so I must assume that the data is either incorrect, falsified, or inaccurate (with the exception of Pew, ICM, and a few others). Many of these links are actually broken or just go in a loop and do not lead to any page at all. For the data that actually is here, we must take it with a grain of salt, because the sample size of these is between a hundred and a thousand people (many of whom are in countries where it is illegal to or could get you killed for condemning the groups in power) and the population of Muslims globally is over a billion. These numbers don't exactly hold up. I might remind you that if Muslims in Syria didn't condemn violence, there wouldn't be a migrant crisis in the first place. Do you really think you are helping the situation by spreading false information? That could only encourage more people to turn to acts of violence.

Or leave the movement and join a different, moderate one, and condemn BLM as something that's become toxic.

But there's a difference to raising awareness, and pissing EVERYONE off.

"No thank you, its one of the worst parts of America for me (ive been there a few times, UK resident). I dont want people hassling me all the time, I dont want waiters sniffing around me for a tip, I DO NOT WANT help with my bags being packed etc etc. Service culture for me is giving me what I paid for, if im going for a meal, bring me my food and leave me alone, im doing shopping in solace, leave me alone."

"That's the problem -- some of you are out here trying to give your ""opinions"" on experiences you know  absolutely nothing about.  Why?  Because you don't stop to take the time to actually listen to us to begin with.  You think you're automatically entitled to being taken seriously when you show up to the debate without any facts or knowledge.  And that's why you come across as a dismissive assholes so often, which in turn is the reason why you get branded as racists and sexists.  Stop blaming the rest of us for not taking you seriously, and start taking a serious introspective look at how you're approaching these issues and figure out what you're doing wrong."
"And then we have the personal attacks. 

Instead of focusing on the issue that is being discussed you instead want to distract from the issue and make the discussion about my personal flaws or history. 

Once again, you prove me right. People don't give a fuck about men as a class. In this case you want to attack my credibility as a way of avoiding that discussion."

"privilege isn't about personal struggle. a specific male may have had a harder life than a specific female, but in general, x society has been built in a way where the general female population of x society have to deal with problems that makes don't. you don't experience x problems and so you don't think they are problems, and that is privilege.

I don't know many people who've had to work since they were kids so their family could eat. I see many ""rich"" or even middle class people as privileged compared to me, someone relatively ""poor"". it does not mean someone who is rich hasn't struggled more than I have in life, they could have definitely. it means that some people have a head start in life when I have to work harder. they can spend their time studying, while I have to spend my time working an trying a lot harder to get my grades up. their uni education is paid for, while I have to either give up my dream job because I can't afford uni, or become a stripper to support myself while studying. richer people may struggle, some more than I've had to. they have problems in life and set backs. but generally, they have a bit of a head start. and all these head starts add up. 

I think it would be a lot easier if education was free, and housing/electricity/food was more affordable so I could have spent my teenage years studying or spending time with friends rather than driving my mental and physical health into the ground working so often and trying to maintain grades, all the while trying to make enough so we can eat and our power doesn't get shut off. but, people who are well of don't see general cost of life that bad, and think education prices are fair. 

*they don't see how this affects people like me, and therefor don't see it as a problem, and this is privilege. privilege is not acknowledging something is a problem because you don't experience it yourself.*"

I've taken opportunity after opportunity to try to get know and understand people and I've gotten pretty good at it. I've worked in a restaurant for many years and dealt with irate assholes a lot and the one thing I've learned is that we're all cunts being cunts to each other and the last thing we need to be doing is vilifying others and instead work on being better people ourselves. (side note: you know how I deal with irate customers? Kill them with kindness and compassion and guess what? Most of them don't expect that and they lose their foundation). 

You know how people always say shit like, ""oh if I was being mugged I'd [insert heroic act]"" when the truth is no one really knows what they would do if they were in that situation? Well you can apply that to this shit.

"In 2005, I proposed to my fiancé. She was the most beautiful and lovely person I knew. We'd been friends for years before we started dating and when I finally proposed, it just felt right. Anyway.

On our wedding day, I was kinda nervous and I was pacing around in the church. Things were still kind of getting set up, not too many guests were there, but the wedding party was using the attached buildings to get ready. I jumped the gun and got dressed with hours to spare. Nerves, you know. 

We were also having the reception in the church (money was tight, and we weren't very opulent people anyway. Religious families, too). So some reception staff was milling around. Waiters, caterers, etc. We actually got a great deal with that because some of the serving staff knew my wife-to-be.

So I walk towards the reception area because I'm all nerves, and I might as well use that to check on things, when I overhear one of my fiancé's bridesmaids -- a friend from college that stuck around -- and a waiter. The door was partially open, and I could just see them.

""What a beautiful wedding,"" says the bridesmaid to the waiter.

""Yes, but what a shame,"" says the waiter. ""What a shame the poor groom's bride is a whore.""

Well, I'd have chimed in with a ""HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF CLOSING THE GODDAMN DOOR"" - but no, it's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.

Anyway, yeah. I broke it off. Look at this way, I mean technically our marriage was saved.

&gt; if you're going to refer to Europe's history of imperialism and conquest as ""hard work,"" and refer to whites as ""the best,"" then your opinions aren't worth engaging

That is absolutely ridiculous not to discuss, that took hard work and lots of it, it is a great achievement and worth noting. Look at America, Australia and many other European countries that is still majority white today. Are those not great achievements? ""Bad ancestors, bad, dont take that country, continent, bad! Stop that right now!""

Actually im the guy that insist ""What about us?"". If your views are so narrow that you dont know greatness and hard work from what it truly is then you are brainwashed and should wake up.

Also history can only be used for so long before it becomes tiresome and just another excuse. Where in history has any white country or civilization ever given you the impression that every single black country and tribe does in the modern age? NEVER!

Thats because we don't want to be victims, so we get working and make ourselves better, we make choices, maybe not the right ones always but we seem to come out on top no matter which way we decide to do it.

Maybe not a huge knowledge of history. But if we are stuck in history forever we will forever be victims of it. And compassion? For what? I only feel sorry for the children, but the moment you are an adult and decide to burn, loot and kill you lose all compassion and sympathy.

Somewhere and at some point facts need to accepted and a decision needs to made to better yourself and your community. Playing the victim card like the jews forever is going to get you nowhere fast."

I don't really care for your life story but getting into normal weight range on a 500kcal/day caloric deficit is a very easy process and 50lbs loss in a year is a very conservative target, you could easily do more if you made a major change to diet and actually exercised even a little bit. 

The only thing holding you back is you. I'm sure you have your own demons causing your inaction.

But it's hard to feign a lot of sympathy for someone stuck in such an easily fixable situation.

"I used to use fatpeoplehate. The vast majority of users were not like that. It was not nearly as bad as many people think. 90% of it was people trying to convince themselves and others to stick to their diets.

The other 10% was people venting about something a fat person said to them. Often people complaining about fat people insulting them for being thin.

I'd just been through and extremely bad breakup and we'd been friends for a while, she gave me advice through the breakup. Looking back it probably wasn't the best advice and she steered me towards what happened but I was young and stupid.

If you look at the other statistic in this thread, namely that despite attempting suicide more often, women only account for 25% of total suicides because men use more lethal methods, what that tells me is that they are not re-attempting, and that many of those deaths are preventable and many people attempting suicide are just having one really bad day.

"&gt; I did not choose the area of the country where I was born.

I don't think people who were just born generally buy houses. Around the time that you can buy a house, is also the time you can decide to move somewhere that better fits your finances.

&gt; I did not choose to have my career completely change 4 years after buying a house

This is a risk everybody faces. It's certainly still a choice you make. If the market is shifting around you, you can choose to stay in it, or find a new one. Or redefine your role within that market.

&gt; I did not choose the fact that the vast majority of employers for my career are more than 50 miles away.

Again, this comes back to you choosing to live where you live now. You most certainly did make that decision.

&gt;  I did not choose to have the person we were going to rent from decide to move back into their house instead.

You chose not to find another place to rent though didn't you?

Again, I'm not saying it's perfect, and it may not fit all of your wants, but that's exactly what they are. Wants. Not needs. It sounds like you have a problem discerning the two apart. These are *choices* that you are making, based on your wants. We don't always get what we want.

&gt; Where the hell are all the people doing menial jobs in the population centers supposed to live?

Well the vast majority of them are able to live right there in the population centers just fine. But yeah, sometimes those housing markets change, and the original residents are driven out. That happens. That still doesn't mean they don't have choices."

"The BLM movement doesn't portray a hatred or fear for white people. If we did we wouldn't have white people protest with us. It is about acknowledging how we have a reason to fear white people, when white police are stealing and abusing the lives of our loved ones and doing so without conviction there is a reason for us to fear our lives. 

Do not undermine the movement because we do not yet have a clear action plan or motive. This is just the beginning, we are increasing awareness of police brutality towards the black community. Before now it wasn't spoken about, without education there cannot be a change. 

It's ignorance from people like yourself who believe they understand the whole of the movement from seeing one video clip or one poorly worded banner that undermines the matter. 

At the end of the day people of all races have come together to show solidarity for our black brothers and sisters around the world it's a first step, it's the first step in telling our oppressors that we will not stand for it anymore and we will not live in fear for our lives solely because of the colour of our skin.

Does enforcing laws that are already on the books, on immigration, make him ""extreme""?

Does renegotiating trade deals (authored by bought-and-paid-for corporate-whore politicians), with countries who are using slave labor make him ""extreme""?

I know he has other opinions and positions, but these three are the ones that I see cause liberal democrats to literally cower with fear.

"That's the thing, Pokemon Go, and any idea like it seemed like a pipe dream, not possible at the time. He wasn't close to describing Pokemon Go, he was like an 8 year old kid talking about a massive expansive Pokemon MMO that is easy to make and the only reason Nintendo hadn't made it was that they hated money. That's why I said the idea was shitty. Half because it was impossible at the time, and half because he was an asshole about it."
"&gt; Religion is just a tool for these people to commit atrocities, they'll align themselves with whatever they feel will have the most impact.

Bzzt. Wrong. They're religious true believers. You do realize that most of the Jihadist leaders end up getting killed right? They know this. They're not just standard criminals. They are fine dying because that means they become martyrs, which means they go straight to heaven. You do know their goal is to create an Islamic State and to create a Caliphate and enforce perfect Sharia Law. They didn't just randomly make up thier ideas in 1955 or something. These ideas come directly from Islam. You can trace the origin of Salafist ideology to anti-modernist movements as a reaction to modern society. And the Gulf States finance this all over the world. 

&gt;If we hate a group of people just because of a minority, 

Who said anything about hating? The left is in total denial about the role of religion in this. I know most are fine people, but too may of them aren't. Reducing immigration of Muslims will reduce future attacks. Sunni Muslims are the most likely to carry out attacks. "
"&gt;You really think they don't attack Russia because they're afraid of Russia?

That's exactly why. They've had brutal outcomes (for the attackers) every time they've tried this shit with Russia.

This is the result of the first big/very public attack on Soviet Russia from muslims:

An interesting excerpt from a different article from NYT that was published 2 months before that hostage crisis was resolved:

&gt;""Despite the stylistic differences between Washington and Moscow, the outcome may be the same. ''I would not be surprised to see them wait it out, even accept the casualties, because there's not much else they can do,'' concluded one diplomat.""

5. Identify the problem- islam. Realize that it happens not because they are poor, but because they are evil.

Some of them also have bayonet lugs, for stabbing things. With a type of knife.

I shoot hardened steel plates and the lead just shatters with no damage. How can I harm an inanimate object?

You seem to have an aversion to guns. That's fine, not everybody grew up around learning to handle them. I'm just pointing out that a gun has no intentions, no morals, and no concerns. It's an inanimate object and by itself is no more dangerous than the block of steel and plastic it was made from. It is the intention of the shooter that makes it what it is."

"I meant had blocked xx% in context to the total ads blocked by uBO + AdBlock. Also I'll just post what I stated about filter lists on my other reply.

Filter Lists:

Not in my experience but if IIRC I have tweaked settings and changed a couple things through guides, not sure if that would have a direct effect on filter lists though. Another thing to keep in mind is uBlock Origin has elements/components that you can block additionally through it's more advanced setting over AdBlock.
Though both have manual element pickers to block certain things, I also find uBO's logger easier accessible but I haven't really used AdBlock's. Also uBlock Origin has a auto-malware filter set up that will block based off of sites you go to and block those in the future even if not read as an ad (same with various domains and certain elements that are only pseudo-ad). Also I believe uBlock Origin has an additonal multi-purpose filter list over AdBlock which is another reason some prefer uBO over AdBlock.
A large amount of what I've experienced though may be due to settings but even if you do a clean install of both, (if done right, only using not even 0.5% extra memory usage) I think it's worth it to get uBO working on top, in case of any filter settings ( even if rarely used)"

"I am very much pro-life. Though honestly I don't like the title ""pro-life', but rather prefer ""against-abortion"".

"This is just an argument in my favour. If the police are such idiots and civilians commit crime and are also idiots, then why would you let any of them have guns?

Why do we have most police carrying weapons and deciding whether or not to kill people on sight?

The only reason that there are right now is that people are insistent on having guns and that means that  there's a definite chance that any particular suspect has a weapon. 


If you took guns away from the population, and clamped down on it, then you can start to remove guns from the police force. The reason there must be some guns in the police force is because when someone shows up with an actual weapon, you need someone armed to take care of the situation. This is taken care of by a small number of police officers trained specifically for this situation in the UK. And because the UK does handle it like that, there are a lot less people killed by the police. There are still accidents, but it's highly restricted.

And, as for the wild hog populations, there are instances where perhaps there need to be weapons. And this work should be carried out by highly trained professionals who go through very stringent background checks."

"You havent provided shit. Did you even read your own link? Are you even capable of comprehending how it doesn't apply to MY ARGUMENT? MY ARGUMENT is that gender identity isn't real to begin with, and I don't need to prove that because that is the DEFAULT position. Nobody had a concept of gender identity until it was invented in the 20th century without being backed up by evidence. It is a psychological invention, the burden of proof is on those who claim it exists, not on those who say there is no proof of it. Find me evidence of gender identity even being a real thing. You very likely will not be able to because no such evidence exists, literally. It is as fictional and as arbitrary as some of Freud's psychoanalytical theories, which were also blindly accepted by some of his contemporaries but are no longer accepted by most people."
"My professor in college was a Tibetan trained Yogi. Stanford medical Hospital told her that she was going to die of cancer. Apparently she spent many years teaching ballet and getting very little sleep. She recovered and now teaches yoga 20 years later. 

There are many different types of cancer though and some spread faster than others. I don't know how she got better and I don't know if she did chemo or not, but she had cancer that should've killed her according to a well reputable hospital, and she lived. It's not like the hospital said you might die you might live. Everything they knew based on their training said she should have died. 

Just another medical mystery I guess. I will say that she was legitimate. As a trained Yogi she wasn't what you see in many modern classes which I'm sure have value too. We learned about how yogis spend years of their life in retreat and meditation. We learned about real and true yogis, and she was one. I don't know why I didn't think to ask her whether or not she went through chemotherapy, but it was a prestigious hospital that diagnosed her and it wasn't like they gave her a small chance but said she's probably going to die. They told her she was definitely going to die. For whatever reason she believed her actions and her lack of sleep and stressful life as a ballet teacher caused her cancer and she believed that she could get better and she did. I have a feeling that she did not endure chemotherapy but I never did ask and she never did say. 

Sorry for being repetitive. I know this doesn't prove that meditation can cure cancer and obviously she had one type of cancer and there are many different kinds, so even if she was able to recover without chemotherapy it doesn’t mean that other people can do it, but it did inspire a profound belief that we can give ourselves better chances in life with whatever might ail us."

I believe all so-called feminists should head straight to some African and Asian places where women are awfully treated, instead of sitting home, eating and yelling ""I am EQUAL"" in countries where they indeed are equal in all political or professional fields. Just because one person says ""a woman's place is in the kitchen"", it doesn't mean the whole country is sexist, it means that the guy is sexist and ignorant and there's little you can change about it. Your false activism won't change an individual's attitude, but your true activism in some other countries will. I'm female, btw.

How far had technology evolved from the time the old testament was written to the time the new one was, in order to represent a significant change in which foods were dangerous and which weren't?

Please, I want to understand. What possible logic could there be to such claims? It makes no sense.

Especially when the true explanation is so simple. The old testament was written with a ""chosen people"" mentality, the idea was to provide grounds for its believers to place themselves above everyone else, hence these kind of restrictions (like ""those impure animals are good enough for those half-humans of other tribes, but not for the chosen people""). The new testament on the other hand was written with an imperialist mentality, the idea was to impose it over the beliefs of the rest of the planet. They figured such a restrictive lifestyle would be harder to impose, so they loosened it as much as they could.

Basically, women use less violent methods - Pills, sitting in the garage with the car turned on, etc... All of which are prone to failure, or have time for someone to walk in and catch+stop them. The idea is that women use suicide attempts as a cry for help; They don't *really* want to die, but they see an attempt as an easy way to get attention.

Men, on the other hand, use more violent methods - Gun in the mouth, jumping off buildings, etc... None of which are easily stopped, and rushing them to a hospital isn't as effective.

So women are more likely to have scars from attempts, while men make damned sure they die the first time they try."

"I would say it is more of lack of options when it comes to sexual partners, leads to a lot more partner sharing. While black men are continuing to be seen as more and more sexually desirable, the black women continue in large part to only be wanted by other black men.


Also(speaking from experience) it would seem that there a large number of women of other races that love to sleep with black men, but refuse to get in serious relationships with them due to social stigma. Then when it is time to get in a relationship, the black man must go back to the black woman after exposure to an unusually high number of partners. This is scenario plays out heavily with student athletes who come from a poor background, many times end up being the most sought after sexual partners on college campuses, they don't get a proper education and are forced back to their old neighborhood to find a partner there. Not to victimize because there is a level of accountability to not fall to the pressures, but it can get hard.

"&gt; lack of multiculturalism/ethnicities in Japan?

Japanese colonies were mostly in asia and they are criticized and hated for their behavior from the colonial era/WW2. 

US gets the brunt of the racism critique because they enslaved a bunch of black people and continue to treat the descendants of those black people poorly. There are also other instances of poor treatment of non-white individuals but those aren't mentioned as much. 

Europe is criticized for racism in part because of their colonial past where their mistreatment still impacts the colonized nations today. Some European countries have also hired foreign workers and didn't manage the situation very well. Also there was that whole Holocaust thing. 

All in all, critics of racism aren't just talking about ""being mean"" to other races. It has to do with oppression and exploitation. For example, US exploited African Americans for their cheap (free) labor and continue to mistreat them, hence they are heavily criticized for it. European countries exploited a lot of countries for their labor and natural resources and treated those people badly (and continue to do so today), hence they are criticized for it. Most Asian or Latin American countries have not been in the position to exploit any other races in recent history, hence they are not criticized in that respect. "

"Well for one, Trump has a college plan that forces admissions to make decisions based on likelihood to find gainful employment after graduation, which has the effect of transforming common biases held by employers into differences in college availability and pricing. In other words, using a technique that you can really only see the effects of ahead of time if you've taken introduction to statistics, his plan increases the prices of all colleges for black students and slightly decreases the price for wealthy white students. The best part is that the effects compound over time. The longer the plan is in effect, the less black students graduate college, which in turn increases the cost for other black students to attend.

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

At the time of drafting of The Bill of Rights, the US was a young, disorganized and frail country, relative to world powers at the time. There was no cohesive and organized military force so to speak. This necessitated the formation of militias to be armed and ready to come to the aid of surrounding states in the event of an attack by a foreign entity or of some domestic upheaval. 

This amendment was not intended to put a gun in the hand of every individual, especially considering the limited regulation involving firearms. Those first few words speak volumes, ""A well regulated militia"""

"
"&gt; the laws are because children can't decide that shit. 

No. That isn't why we have these laws. These laws were created so that unions in the early 20th century could outlaw their competition. When they successfully kicked ""children"" out of the workforce, those children, who were actually independent adults or had their own families/were the main income earners in their families and responsibilities, turned primarily to prostitution in the major urban centers. An huge influx of young prostitutes led to widespread abuses as people where lining up and begging to suck dick/get fucked so they wouldn't starve to death. 

The public outcry was huge, as legal child prostitute (prostitution was legal in most states until world war 1) abuse became the click bait story of the time, so the federal government moved in with their plan to institute public education so these now legally unemployable unemployed people could do something productive with their lives. Initially, this was only for the lower class/unmployed/poor ""children"" of immigrants or immigrant descent, but then one day the federal government went: ""lol just kidding"", and made it mandatory for everyone. From then on, the arguement was that children needed to be educated, and disagreeing was illegal. From THAT scenario, about 80 years later, came the ""scientific"" reason that children can't consent because their ""brains"" weren't developed enough. Never mind the fact that we didn't even have the tools to measure that kind of stuff and make those kinds of observations until the last 10 years. And what has modern neurology taught us? Human brains never stop developing, and realistically a brain hasn't matured until you are well paste 25. 

tldr; age of consent is arbitrary with no scientific basis and is designed to deprive young people of their rights and force them into federal daycare. "

I bet to differ, the argument isn't even black lives matter. I was pulled over by cops riding a goddamn bike while they were in the middle of pulling over someone in a car,  in front of where I work. I have a cousin who was hit by a police van, flew ten yards, because he was in the vicinity of something he wasn't even aware of. I know of many people, personally, framed for things they did not do. I will not question what race you are, but should you be black, and ask this question then I am more than happy that your life has a lack of these situations,  as for me, my family and friends,  any situation involving police officers is life and death, it is that fucking serious. I have had guns pulled on me by police,  in a situation where I WAS ASKED TO HELP THEM, but the way I look, where I'm from, I fit the fucking description.

"I mean, the shooters are murderers and in the wrong, but do people expect that cops can kill citizens again and again with no real repercussions, and the general public will take it again and again with no breaking point? At some point someone will snap and shit like this happens."
"And that's why we need to get a bit tighter with all freedoms. It's so easy for everyone to get guns because (to keep it simple) we can't just tell someone to fuck off anymore. No someone could pretty easily smooth talk their way into getting a firearms license even if everyone around him gets a really bad feeling because ""oh its his right"". 

No man screw that, if some guy named Abdul who can hardly speak english with his eyes sketchily darting around the room, or some hick named Bubba who just looks like an all around trashy person, or some sketchy black kid with his pants down past his ass, I think it should be perfectly okay to deny him just based off of that. 

I really really think any kind of political correctness needs to go out the fucking window for a good long while. The entire fucking country just circlejerks itself on the news and twitter until people get hyped up enough to go shoot something up, and then people get even angrier and, well, you've been alive this week you see what happens.

"It's all part of the practice of giving a shit. 

Making an effort to dress yourself nicely tends to influence how you behave during the rest of the day. One of the ways that depressed people are told to help themselves is to always get dressed in the morning, even if you have nothing to do. The act of preparing yourself makes you feel better and more productive all by itself. Also, when people are dressed up, it tends to make them act more dressed up. Like if they dress like their job really matters, they might work as though their job really matters.

Also, I imagine it's just a good shield against a lot of bullshit. You don't need to worry or deal about people wearing things that are inappropriate when there is even the loosest of dress codes.

All that said, I get that it can be a pain and can feel like you are trapped in a ridiculous monkey suit all day, even though you spend 8 hours a day in a windowless server room. I just do think that there is real method to this particular madness. "

We don't just go around looking at genitals believe it or not. Not disclosing information pertaining to your Hrt and reassignment, you'll be dismissed as having a cold or stomach bug. And in the case of the before mentioned case, end up back in the ED because your tubular pregnancy ruptured and now you're dying.

I'm a trans guy and there is literally no chance of me being pregnant because I've only had PIV sex once and it was over seven months ago. So that would not be a legitimate reason for me to disclose my trans status, sorry. Nor would it be for a straight trans man, a trans man who has had a hysterectomy, a trans man who has sex with men but doesn't do PIV, etc. Once I have a hysterectomy and no longer have a cervix there will be no risk of cervical cancer and therefore no medical reason to get a pap smear. My health needs are not the same as a cis woman's.

I also don't feel like being charged for a pregnancy test that is 100% unnecessary tbh. That said, I WOULD disclose, even though I know it means I'm going to have to deal with dicks like you. It's almost like, maybe if 'medical professionals' were more informed about trans issues and less dickish, more trans people would feel comfortable disclosing and you could save more lives...

&gt;Cancers affect genders differently. Heart issues, the endocrine system, Strokes, MCI, genetic deformities, congenital diseases, even they way the human body processes medication are all affected by sex.

They're also all affected by hormone levels which are going to be different for someone on HRT, so no, you wouldn't treat a trans woman as a male or a trans man as a female because you'd ignore things like, say, the risk of breast cancer in trans women or high cholesterol in trans men or other things that are affected by hormones."

If you switched black and white people (as if black people were slaveowners), it would be the same, but with whites being ""criminals"".

The post didn't say ""black people are awful and naturally prone to being awful"". Post said completely different thing, and it's you who made such a parralel. Talk about being racist and calling someone out on being racist."
Aaaaand you are doing the same exact thing by lumping us all up with some of the idiots that lurk on reddit.

"More autism, plus you are flat out wrong.

nothing in this making-of documentary, which is full of interviews with the creators, indicates that it's ever intended as any sort of satire against the people who you claim it is (and apparently, according to your autistic rant, people like me too).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SroICnksANA

That's pretty much the proof you are wrong right there. They talk about wanting to make show about ""how life really is"" rather than shit like Cosby and Brady Bunch.

The shows creators deliberately wanted to be inflammatory and rebellious + yes the show was aimed at blue collar types who could relate to The Bundy's.

It was about counterculture. It was about upsetting the social values of the time. It wasn't made in 2016. It wasn't about ""stereotypes"" and ""misogyny"". People didn't give a shit about those things back then. Marcy Darcy, the feminist character in the series, is the most lampooned and made fun of character in the whole ensemble.

Dumbass.

I swear 2016 is the year of the autistic loser who thinks he's people because our society has pumped up his ego.

Also, sorry if you got more than one notification for this reply, reddit is lame and shadowbans posts with certain words in it now apparently.

And if you watch that documentary right to the very end, you'll hear the shows original creator say the greatest thing about it is that it's a half hour of TV where you don't have to sit down and worry about learning anything or any of that bullshit that you see on most sitcoms. Pretty clear indicator that he wasn't trying to ""satire stereotypes"" as that would be pretty much directly contrary to that statement he made.

The 90's were a different culture and people didn't link everything back to ""satire on racism"" and lame shit, deal with it and all the people who downvoted my previous statements pretty much have made fools of themselves because I'm just telling the facts and you're all factually wrong.

It's easy to say not to eat the cake, but for some folks, that's as hard as running 10k. If you can get them to exercise, then they can splurge sometimes which makes cutting down on eating psychologically easier."

"What are your qualifications for nutrition? My SO and I became vegan (or plant-based rather, at first) for health reasons after he did extensive research, as a nutritionist and professional athlete, into whether animal products were truly healthy. This was not a moral decision for us at first, but purely health and we have spent years looking into these things. 

It's not at all, the tiny supplement I take is like 20,000% of my daily b12 or something. We don't get enough b12 anymore because it's a bacteria in the soil, and the way modern agriculture is, coupled with how we wash all of our veggies off so much, is why we don't get enough. The only reason we get b12 from animal products is because  they fortify the animals with b12. 

Did you know that the FDA banned egg companies from claiming that they are ""healthy or safe"" to consume? They are high in cholesterol which causes heart disease, which is one of the number one killers of adults today. The President of the American College of Cardiology adopted a vegan diet and suggests it to all of his patients to keep the heart healthy. Animal products cause a lot of illness and disease and really have exactly 0 benefits. Protein in plants is way more efficient than that in animal products as your body can process it immediately instead of having to extract secondary protein and burn energy to get it. 

Milk is meant for baby cows. We are the only species that eats milk into adulthood, milk is extremely acidic in pH and it creates a calcium deficiency as our body uses our own calcium from bones to fight the acid in milk. 

Hens only have between 12-24 eggs a year without human intervention, it is not possible to humanely have eggs as you overwork the hens which makes them unhealthy and takes a lot of energy. Milk cows are repeatedly impregnated by what the dairy farms lovingly call the ""rape rack"", then their babies are torn away immediately to become veal. Even at a small farm, which very, very few people have access to no matter how many claim they have ""an uncle with a farm"", cows are milked much longer than necessary and spend a lot more energy to produce it all. If you've ever known a woman whose pregnant, dealing with swollen milk filled breasts is not enjoyable or feels good at all. If we're talking humane, there's no way to humanely drink milk or eat eggs. 

If you're determined to be lied to, you'll find plenty of ""scientific"" evidence that animal products are perfectly healthy, as the egg/dairy/meat industry is HUGE and has a lot of money to manipulate information and they also get kickbacks from the government. It's really up to you if you want to do the research and think for yourself or if you're fine being addicted to your food and become fat and sick like most humans end up when they start getting older. 

Not to mention how bad the meat industry is for the environment, and the fact that we could solve world hunger by growing food for people to eat instead of growing food to feed to animals so we can eat them. 

Here's a few videos from people who are extremely well researched and have much better scientific sources than I do. If you click on ""show more"" under their videos they source everything extensively.

Which is why its done to infants who won't remember and honestly barely react when it happens. Hell I've seen babies be more upset during their baptism than their circumcision. 

Really, it's not as traumatic as people think. It's not like they cut the head of the dick off. 

Jews as a culture are very well educated and intelligent. They fill areas of the scientific community. Now don't you think, that they'd be the first ones looking into whether or not circumcision is wrong? Because they have been. And after years and years of study. nothing has come out proving the practice is harmful in anyway. The potential upsides have been hotly debated. But no detrimental effects have ever been found."

Forcing someone to work more than 48 hours in one week in the US is illegal, and there is no limit on how many hours they can ask you to work per day, so technically if they asked her to work 24 hours one day and split the remaining 24 hours among the other 6 days they didn't break the law.

It's official: military declares coup d'état in Turkey
Military and jandarma have shut down bridges in Istanbul. Social media is blocked and only works with vpn. Helicopters and warplanes over Bosporus. My sources say Erdogan's last known location was Marmaris and he has fled the country as news of coup broke.
This is serious!
Update: Atatürk airport is seized by military.
Update 2: Turkish Military have seized TRT 1 national TV station and request all stations to read an official statement. Major point: To restore Turkeys democratic, secular, social constitution, which represents all ethnicities of Turkey appropriately. There is a curfew in place and the military will do everything in their power that the transition will take place without any Turkish citizen being harmed.
Decalaration continues, that this measure was necessary, because the current government has worn down the core principles of the visionary leader and founder of the Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and lead the way to corruption, absence of law, international isolation and warmongering.
Update 3: Erdogan calls in via facetime to a news show, where pro-AKP journalists interview him. He threatens all responsible for the coup to be punished hard. He calls all his supporters to go out to the streets and protest the coup on main places, despite the curfew, calling for an open confrontation of civilians with military.
Update 5: Rumor has it, that the whole coup is staged. Erdogan has called on supporters to run the streets, muezzins have called upon citizens to go out, especially to places seized by military. Military at Atatürk Airport is said to be retreating and forfeiting to civilians. One bridge that was blocked is said to be open again. 
This theory is supported by leaks of whistleblower Fuat Avni, according to which Erdogan was planning to put the country into chaos in order to demonstrate his power and weaken opposition forces like Gülen and the Kemalists in Turkish Military by using his allegiant civilian base.
Update 6: People gather on some places with Turkey flags, despite Military curfew. CHP leader Kilicdaroglu has condemnded the coup. Commander in Chief General Hulusi Akar has been taken hostage by lower ranked officers.
Update 7: My sources from Ankara report heavy clashes near the Anitkabir Monument.
Update 8: Massive crowds have gathered in front of Atatürk Airport, chanting ""La ilahe illallah Allahu Akbar"" - it seems military has completely retreated from the originally seized airport. Erdogan followers have now seized the airport.
Update 9: Head of Religious Institution Mehmet Görmez speaks on TV. He says it is the religious duty of all righteous citizens to resist to this coup and defend the rule of law. He says that lights of all mosques will be lit all night and that muezzins will call upon all citizens to defend the government. Görmez obviously is a close ally to Erdogan.
Update 10: 17 Police officers are reported dead after assault of military on Gölbasi police station. Military is trying to disarm loyal police around Istanbul.
In Ankara a helicopter of coupists has been shot down by F16 Fighter Jet.
Update 11: Politicans of AKP are live via facetime on CNN Türk condemning this coup and pointing to the will of the people, who are on the streets protesting despite coupists curfew.
Update 12: President Obama has made an announcement, calling for the support of the democratically elected government.
Update 14: My sources from Istanbul state: ""Its all a show by loyal government supporters, staging a coup in order to distract from Turkeys current problems. Erdogans intention is to blame parallel state and Gülen Movement for economic disaster."" This theory is also backed by announcements of Fuat Avni, who predicted these very chaotic scenes 2-3 weeks ago on Twitter.
Update 15: Chief of Turkish intelligence MIT says that coup has been defeated. Clashes have diminished and military is retreating. 
I found the very tweets of Fuat Avni where he predicted this very escalation Nostradamus-Style. Posted in the comments with translation.
Update 16: There are reports on live television of bomb explosions in Turkish Parliament TBMM broadcasted by AKP MPs via facetime to news shows.
Update 18: catharsis: TRT national TV is freed by loyal Erdogan followers and news host who read out declaration of coupists says she is delighted that everything is over. The last hours were very tense, she was very stressed, the coupists had weapons and forced her to read out the statement, but reassured her that they have no intention of harming anybody and that they do this for the best of this country.
Update 19: Someone who claims to be Head of Jandarma Arif Cetin says he strongly condems this coup. He sounds like a retard, host quickly but politely shuts him down and moves on. 
News of how the will of the people has prevailed follow. 
Twitter seems to be back online as tweets of Prime Minister Binali Yildirim are quoted, where he thanks the people of Turkey for defending the Turkish democracy.
Update 20: Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt Cavusoglu says that he received strong support from international leaders, he couldnt even read all the messages, all condemning the coup.
Update 21: TRT is back live, news host Tijen Karas is being celebrated for being so brave, states that she was forced with weapons to read out declaration of coupists. Subtitle says: ""People saved TRT""
Update 22: CNN Türk now shows live videos of civilians on top of tanks being driven through streets of Istanbul. Erdogan is supposed to appear in Istanbul soon, while a group of coupist soldiers is reported to be entering Dogan Media Center, advancing towards news room of CNN Türk.
Update 23: For alternative updates I recommend Karabekir Akkoyunlu and Christian Feiland who both are in Turkey and trustworthy sources of information, as well as Kerem Schamberger, who made some facebook live posts with political assessments.
Update 25: Habertürk is now broadcasting the emptied studio of CNN Türk and speculating that a new message of coupists will be read out, as murmurs of soldiers were heard, that they were looking for a news host.
Meanwhile PM Binali Yildirim is reported to have said that this was an outright act of terror. Erdogans plane has landed in Istanbul and a speech is expected shortly. 
A female reporter says that four mortar bombs hit Turkish Parliament, 12 wounded, 4 of them severely.
Update 26: President Erdogan tweets: ""I call on everyone to go to city squares and airports. I also will be with them."" Original tweet in comments.
Update 27: President Erdogan tweets: ""I have never recognized any power over the power of the people and will never do so."" Original tweet in comments. 
Annotation: Erdogan only speaks Turkish, no English. It is safe to assume, it was an advisor, who sent the tweets.
Update 28: Habertürk reports that the situation in Ankara is still tense, as well as CNN Türk studios, where a second declaration of coupists is expected soon. Meanwhile Erdogan as of right now Erdogan has landed at Ataturk Airport, where thousands of loyal followers are awaiting him.
Update 29: Erdoğan is greeted by his followers. His plane came from Dalaman, which is the closest to Marmaris, where he spent his holidays.
Update 30: Erdogan speaks: ""This was an heinous act, that was planned for a long time. They have been trying to do this, because they cannot stand the democratically elected government and the will of the Turkish people. Eventually, this act is a gift of Allah, because it shows us, that the military, which is infected, needs to be cleaned. New Turkey will be a lot different and we have to push these changes. The parallel state has waged a war on on the state, with F16s flying over our country, bought with our money to defend us, now threatening us. What is this? I just came from Marmaris. I received news that they bombed several places there, because they thought I was still there. They have taken my general secretary as hostage, and I dont know whats up with my commander in chief. But I call upon all officers, you are the bearers of the rights of this people, and you have to act responsibly. You must not take orders from Pennsylvania. These orders are evil. I call upon all our soldiers, you are our men, our mehmetcik, you cannot raise your weapons against your mothers and fathers. These weapons were given to you from your people, and if you turn them against your people, you will pay the price. Our troops are clean and they shall not be dirtied, and everyone who did this will be treated as just like those armed terrorists that we know. You are shooting our people with our peoples weapons. And the international media, who cannot stand that Turkish economy is so big, is claiming that there is a coup in Turkey. What a joke. We will show these invaders and never leave our country to them. This is it. I thank you all.
Q: There are reports of 17 dead, what do you know?
RTE: We have no numbers, but what is most important for you, what time is it? 4:30, our people are on the streets
Q: President, I am a Kurd, I am a Turk, and I stand with you!
RTE: May God bless you. At this point judiciary is already prosecuting. Please be patient, everything will come out, time will show. I am with my people.
Update 31: I will take a break, this was it. Great show, I am glad the body count was not as high as Fuat Avni predicted, but I am shocked, that his predictions were dead on, even though he has has a perfect record with hardly any fails. If you still have no clue what is going on in Turkey, I recommend watching the movie ""Wag the Dog"". One thing is for sure: tonight was history in the making

But also didn't they just find that a marijuana compound removes a protein related to Alzheimer's? http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/311347.php

And there's a shit load more links where that came from. Also a side effect of marijuana is confidence, (hey just like your alcohol) so it does help with anxiety, I can tell that first hand, it shows me what I want to feel like everyday and gives me motivation to work for. 

People don't claim it isn't bad for them, theres always the argument that it's no where near as bad for a normal minded person as cigarettes are. I'll take a small to moderate chance of gum disease over a high chance of lung cancer or organ disease. Facts are facts mate.

When I was in my sophomore year of highschool, I used to sleep over at my buddy's house all the time. He had a nice, regular room, the only oddity was that it was disconnected from the house, it was in the corner of their back yard. In his room was one of those glass squares in the ceiling (I'm blanking out on what they're called), which is essentially a sun roof for a house. For some reason, his sun roof was fairly opaque and foggy so you couldn't really see through it. 

We were having a gaming marathon but only for one app on our phone where you were a bird basically jumping off walls, avoiding spikes, and collecting candy. About two hours in I look up at the sun roof, and what I saw I'll never be able to forget. It was a little man. Just a tiny man, in a plain white t-shirt. A full grown man, with regular body proportions, and a regular looking face scaled down to about half a foot, army crawling atop the sunroof. 

I have never been as scared as when I saw the little man. I didn't know what to do or say, I was just looking at this toy story-esque tiny little unexplainable man crawling on top of the ceiling, and he did it so fluidly, just human-like. It was the only point in my life I remember being truly in a state of shock. 

After what felt like a century I look to my friend in horror to explain to him what I was seeing, and this idiot is literally crawling around his bed in a rectangular pattern for no fucking reason, since who knows. Literally crawling back and forth around the corners of his bed on his elbows and knees for no fucking reason at like 3 in the morning. I check for the little man again, and he's doing the same. I check my friend again, still crawling. Same clothes, same crawl, same lack of reasoning and I realize what's happening. 

The sun roof was reflecting my fucking idiot friend being a fucking idiot at 3 in the fucking idiot morning. All and all, it's not so eventful a story, I'll just never ever forget the 15 or so seconds I was watching the unexplainable maybe alien crawling on the roof of my buddy's home in the nothing hours of morning. I don't think I'll ever experience that feeling again. Such confusion and fear and curiosity and everything all at once. I didn't have an idea what was happening. 

Anyway all my friends call that the little man story, and it's become a bit of an urban legend in my little group.

I don't really follow how you would get to 'very high' based only on the number of terrorists compared to the number of muslims. The average Muslim doesn't murder anyone and also doesn't have the tendency to. The problem here is that there are *more* Muslim terrorist attacks than other terrorist attacks *at this moment*.

nothing good can come from watching those videos especially knowing the police wont be charged and are on paid leave chilling with their families at home after just destroying innocent families lives. this has been going on for decades and thanks to camera phones we just getting to see what really happens. previously with no footage these police would have been labeled as heroes. its been open season on blacks for police in america for a long time. peaceful protests hasnt changed anything. they just have no fear of murdering innocent people.

"When nonviolence is preached as an attempt to evade the repercussions of political brutality, it betrays itself. When nonviolence begins halfway through the war with the aggressor calling time out, it exposes itself as a ruse. When nonviolence is preached by the representatives of the state, while the state doles out heaps of violence to its citizens, it reveals itself to be a con. And none of this can mean that rioting or violence is ""correct"" or ""wise,"" any more than a forest fire can be ""correct"" or ""wise."" Wisdom isn't the point tonight. Disrespect is.

"But hey, if the victim is young enough you can do it and get a pat on the back for your courage and strength!"
Is it your skin or the way you dress that makes the cop react differently to you. If you wear a flat brimmed cap and a chain (no matter how harmless you are) you are essentially emulating the gang/rapper lifestyle and put yourself at a severe disadvantage when dealing with the cops. I don't think we have seen a black man in a suit be shot yet for reaching for his wallet but i could be wrong.

This seems more like you're just frustrated with how society is morphing and are trying to tie it to your profession to validate your feelings. It makes sense that you would grasp for a relation in that way, but it seems like shaky ground to stake your frustration on since you, as a medical professional, would have a number of resources (including, up front, a physical examination of your patient) at your disposal to clear up any confusion you might have.

"Because they carry their pistols on their hip right under their hand.

When they get excited / scared it is right there to grab. They carry their tasers on their chest.

It should be reversed.

They should carry their taser or rubber bullet gun on their hip, ready to grab and have their lethal firearm on their chest in a reverse hand holster.

Meaning if they are right handed the holster should be worn so it is easiest to draw left handed and then move it to their right hand.

This would give them a fraction of a second to think twice whether they want to use a lethal weapon or not."

I get that a lot of people are afraid of the police, I do, and I get that a lot of these deaths were due to police brutality, and even underlying racism, but honestly this **bullshit** isn't helping, it's just perpetuating a cycle of violence where officers will feel more threatened, meaning they will make more mistakes, which in turn means civilians will feel more endangered, and **they in turn** will make more mistakes, leading back to police feeling more endangered.

Please, for the love of god: the only way to stop this madness is to **stop protesting**, to **stop antagonizing the police, whether it is warranted or not**, and to call for a dialogue between the police, the people and the state to sort this out **without** all these protests and riots breeding more confrontation."

&gt; This was not a Columbia repeat, but planning takes time. 

Bull.  You've had years, decades to plan.  You plan ahead so (IF you actually care) when -god forbid- bad things happen you don't sit around for hours while people die.  Heck you even go on to say I'm right that they did fuck up by just standing outside.  


&gt; The police treated it as a hostage situation, while the shooter was executing people inside. If they stormed it straight ahead less lives would be lost, yes, but that's how it went down.

&gt; They did their best, and their best wasn't good enough. I can accept that, because nothing short of a 0% mortality rate would satisfy people.

Treating it as a hostage situation when gunfire is clearly audible ?  If that's their 'best' they all need to be on the bread lines.


&gt; because nothing short of a 0% mortality rate would satisfy people.

straw man.  Even with my deep seated hatred for these violent thugs I don't expect perfection, but waiting till the killer runs out of bullets to setp forward is cowardice of the highest order.   If there was an honorable man among them he would have gone home and studied the Japanese traditions of honor and what to do when you have none.


&gt; And in that case, isn't that even more admirable? They don't have to do something, yet they do it anyway, out of principle alone.

That's the problem... they didn't do anything.  They waited hearing cries for help, screams from victims and gunshots.  They then shrugged and said ""Better thee than me"" and ordered a second round of donuts."

Basically the paedos were pretty rare and fucking obvious and fucking easy to evade.

"&gt; For example, there is no housing segregation in the United States. People can freely live where they want if they can afford the neighborhood. The issue crops up through public housing. When the government provides housing for poor people, it clusters them together and the poor people tend to be predominately one race in a given area.

That's not what I meant. I'm talking about the effects. The why is hard to break down, but there is some kind of racism involved, whether from tenants and house owners or from the institutions. 

&gt; I agree, but probably in the opposite way you intended. You probably mean Trump is a racist, but I don't think he is. However, there are numerous politicians that are minorities that openly advocate policy based on race and get elected based on race.

"That would make sense if any of it were true. Several of the last high profile mass shootings in the US were done with illegally obtained fire arms. But none of that matters if you care about US lives other than just white middle class suburban lives. 

Mass shootings are a small percentage of gun violence in the US. The vast majority is committed with illegally obtained weapons. This wouldn't be slowed down with making it more difficult for people to buy and register guns. 

I think it's also dumb as hell to ignore the mental health aspect of radicalized terrorism. How is that different from other mental health issues? 

As for the last paragraph that could just as easily be attributed to more people concealed carrying. It sounds like you just made that part up or are parroting someone who made it up. 

The point is that I think it would also make the data more biased to take that out. It's taking out gun crime data that wouldn't be stopped by gun control legislation which seems pretty biased to me to ignore certain deaths that aren't really different. "

"My main problem with the gun debate is simple.. the easy and ready access to guns in America is absolutely the reason crazy people are so easily able to shoot up public spaces. When somebody can order an arsenal from Walmart online and have it show up the next day, you have a problem.

And anybody who doesn't think *that alone* is reason to work on reducing access to deadly weapons is an idiot. 

In Australia, guns are *not* banned, despite what reddit thinks. I'm Australian and I grew up in a house full of guns. My dad is a hunter and clay target shooter with over a dozen firearms. 

The differences are in how they are handed out. First you need a license, which to get requires you to have a legitimate reason to own a gun.. of which ""cause I want one"" or ""for defence"" is not valid. Hunting is, so is sport shooting. Farmers can have them for pest control. Background checks are done, regulations are enforced for storage and police *do* come knocking now and then to check up on it.

Then every time you want to buy a new gun, the process is long and arduous...but it keeps firearms in check.

Now yes.. there are illegally obtained weapons in Australia. And sometime people get shot and killed. But we *don't* have pissed off teenagers shooting up schools. We *don't* have people dying in nightclubs and movie theatres.

Yet in America, it's just become normal for one of these shootings to happen every month or two. And everyone gets sad, says it's horrible, agrees that something needs to be done.. and then *literally nothing changes*. A little while later some more people die and it starts all over again.

It's utter insanity. "
"&gt;that nobody wants to hear?

I can think of a certain group that loves to hear those facts. I would guess there might be a few on this site based on the way I periodically see these exact same statistics brought up. I think they're called lacists or something?

&gt;inb4 facts can't be racist

Very true, and these facts are not racist. But I have to be a bit suspicious about the people who post them. Somehow they are never accompanied by stats like the rate of black poverty or education level or average number of parents. Nor are they used to start a discussion in the context of a country that had legal segregation and disenfranchisement barely over 50 years ago.

Rather they seem to just be thrown out there, and we're expected to draw our own conclusions solely from the data given. The data is very real and very worth talking about, but the way its presented very clearly implies that the cause of the crime is race. Now maybe OP isn't a racist and never intended his facts to be viewed this way, but if that's the case I think he should consider adding a bit more breadth to his data spread. As it is now this is almost identical to a copypasta I remember from back when r/coontown was still here."
The kind who thinks she's a man and denies there's any difference.
"If you want to see how it plays out, look at normal group dynamics between all male and mixed groups. In all male groups, you get a clear hierarchy where everyone has a role. In mixed groups, outside of the rare circumstances where the woman is competent, the group has to cover for her and productivity is lost because everyone isn't pulling an equal share.

Women are also less apt at negotiating a better salary, so they accept the minimum offered (which you damn well know you should always negotiate for more based on your skills) because they believe that everyone is ""treated fairly"". Now, in the interests of ""fairness"", the company can now justify paying everyone (males and females) the same as the worst negotiator of the group because ""it wouldn't be fair"". It's in the companies best interests to shave off as much overhead as possible as it leads to more profit. Now, someone can't protest against this because it would fly in the face of ""fairness"" and the social pressure of ""you don't want it to be fair, how dare you"" is laid on that person.

It's a goddamn web where one thing plays into another. This wage gap bullshit is part of it. Flatly put, women don't have as long careers due to child-rearing and they cannot commit the same amount of time and energy a man can. But nobody gives a shit that the dude has spent more time on the job, spends longer hours with less free time, less time with his family who he is providing for, none of that matters. Women feel they aren't being remunerated the same as the dude who is putting in the time, regardless of the fact that they never bothered to negotiate their contract in the first place, so wages are driven down.

Business is ruthless. It's a fight on social terms where you outmanoeuvre the opponent to get the best possible deal you can for yourself while taking something from someone else. Because at the end of the day, you are selling your time and experience for money. For that, you need to be aggressive, which men are. If women can't play the game then they shouldn't be on the field fucking it up for the actual players. This ain't no Sunday League, this is the goddamn Premiership."

Anyway we went to a casino, by then I was so blitzed out of my mind on pot and alcohol the gambling machines and various ameneties were like psychadelic washes of neon lights and chrome everywhere.  It was beautiful, scary, and weird all at the same time.

There was a tribute band there, we thought it was the actual celebrity act himself!  I think the celebrity act himself would have been proud of our totally rock n' roll behavior that night.

The rest of that night is like a blaze of lights, I honestly can't remember the rest of it other than I think losing $30 to a slot machine in 10 minutes (my budget for gambling , it was my first and only time) and then doing shots at the Casino's bar.  The rest, more pretty lights and bizzaro sights that I can only figure were the casino's decor twisted by my BA and THC consumption levels."

Of course that convinenently exclude the accidental gun deaths, so called self defense killings and killings by police because they suspect that the perperator is armed

No civilised human being in the world needs killing machines, certainly not citizens of one of the most advanced country in the world. But of course, NRA which has more wealth than most countries has been brainwashing Americans right from childhood. Its like a gospel for them now

Just like religious belief, no evidence or statistic is going to convince a gun nut about the harms of guns. They just KNOW they are right and will defend it to death. Confirmation bias, ignoring contrary views, only using sources they want, ignoring negative studies all are part of the same mentality. Where every country in the world believes people should trust their neighbours more and no one needs killing machines for defense. only Americans, brought from childhood on NRA propaganda will believe the opposite"

"Because this is shitty negging. Lots of idiots try to run Game without understanding half of it. First of all, negging was only meant for situations like a super hot  model woman who is always showered in compliments from many orbiters, in such a situation being a bit critical of her makes a man look interesting as he is doing it different than the others. But one does not neg ""normal"" women, because if a woman is not 200% sure of her attractiveness it backfires.

Second, a good neg isn't an insult. A good neg is something like calling a woman a good person, an innocent one, or a nonconformist, an outright compliment on the surface. However it makes her think ""wait why didn't he just called me outright hot and sexy?"" and this thought is what the neg wants a achieve. When a hot woman thinks you are nice to her but somehow don't fall all over her because of her hotness it makes you look interesting. But never do to a ""normal"" girl who is unsure of her attractiveness.

Game is something for intelligent and tactful men. When idiots learn a half assed way of it and date ""normal"" girls and throw out insults left and right, they deserve what they get (which is usually a beer in the face or something similar)."

When will the US rule against firearms?

Nobody should be allowed to own a semi-automatic rifle at home or even a gun in general unless you have a license for it and you shouldn't be allowed to carry it anywhere unless it's in a safe box and unloaded at all times.

The NRA is a ridiculous organization.

Edit: Someone deleted a comment before I finished my answer...here is the answer:

1. Well keep complaning when there are mass killings and shootings in schools, in public places, with black people, on policeman/fathers, etc.

This lack of rules is causing that and it will continue to happend until to change that. When a tragedy happens, blame yourselves, not the mentally unstable person who shot everyone. How is a deranged person allowed to buy and own a gun?

2. Thank god I was born and raised in Canada

3. We have problems yes...But no problems at all (or almost) with firearms...Not so hard to do some benchmarking...Hey look, it works  like wonder in Canada...Let's do the exact opposite because an old paper says we have the right to own a gun.

4. Well good job on encouraging war, killings, mass shootings, etc. Next time something like this happens, think me of and realize you have blood on your hands."

But it is possible for 2 young and crazy free spirits to share a bed out of concenience/necessessity without violating their respective relationship contracts.

Now, with the knowlege that they dated after, we can pretty safely assume that she had feelings for him at the time.

She thinks she's way more mature than me but in reality she has the maturity level of a 12 year old. I'm not exactly sure what, but I think there's something not right with her. Last time we fought it was about a comment thread on facebook and she thought she was being sarcastic by saying the opposite of what everyone else is saying, and when I told her it didn't look like sarcasm, she got really upset and deleted most of her comments. I tried to explain how sarcasm works to her but she wouldn't listen. That was our most recent fight, and then we didn't talk for a while after that.

* 4. Publicly apologize for atrocities committed by your state and pledge to never again interfere in Muslim affairs. 
* 5. Forcibly deport all individuals unwilling to renounce Islam. 
* 6. Maintain a robust security presence, prohibit immigration and visitation from individuals within Islamic countries.
* 7. Eliminate all trade with Islamic countries.

"I was sitting at a restaurant once, mindlessly watching an NFL documentary while I ate.  It was a documentary on training camp. It was basically an hour of white guys telling black men how high to jump, how fast to run, how hard to work out and measuring the black men's height and wingspan and muscle mass and taking notes, which were subsequently used to pick who should be drafted to their billion dollar team. I was in a restaurant so the volume was down and all I could see was the imagery. I remember turning to the person I was with and having an in depth conversation about how the NFL is essentially modern day slavery. It really made me sad. "

Edit: I'm sure it's come across as hostile, and j have no intention of this, I feel this way because I support equal rights for everyone, and I don't want myself or anyone else to placed in a situation where they're forced to have a child they can't support or take care of, and if women can do it, so should men.  Obviously we can't allow men to force a woman's decision on abortion, but he should have some form of an out as well."

"*Excuse me* but this is incredibly offensive.  It is a well-known fact that 100% of rape is committed by men or male-sympathizers ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_gender#Rape_of_females_by_males)).  Due to the severe nature of rape, it is best for society to automatically assume guilt instead of assume innocence.  It is better to lock away innocent men than to allow falsely acquitted rapists to roam the streets.  You males will never understand the fear of being raped.  Personally, I think *all* males should be locked away.  We should castrate the undesirables and only let the best male specimens out occasionally for the sole purpose of procreation. Unfortunately the established patriarchal society won't allow for this.  *Thanks* patriarchy."

"Companies can offer more vacation or maternity leave as a perk to attract new employees. The idea of *forcing* all companies to provide such things is insane, in my opinion. A company pays money in exchange for your time. If you make the personal life choice to reproduce, that ought to be no concern of the company. They had no say in it. The idea that they'd have to pay your empty chair for 12 weeks (or whatever) is mind-boggling.

&gt;Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether ""religiosity"" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases.[1] Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious.[2] Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.[3][4]

"He is a Muslim that won a Democratically held election, multiple times. The people of Turkey clearly support him and his policies. "
"It seems that you do not have a firm belief system, if it is unclear to you. 

For me, as a Muslim, it is very clear

"1. America would be better without guns. They use the same argument every time and ignore the fact that places with no guns (like Canada, where I live) have less than 20% of the crime that the US does.

2. There's two genders, you're transgender? I'm cool with that, be whatever you identify as, as long as it's one of the two genders. And I fully support LGBT and stuff but LGBTQ+... is just at the point of people obsessing over special snowflake status."
"I just dont think a weapon is the right way to defend yourself + i think having a weapon leads to more occasions where self defense would be needed. If no one had a weapon but policemen, there wouldnt be that much shootings so how in hell cant you guys see that this is a slippery slope once you begin with permitting anyone to have a weapon?"
You understood the message he was trying to convery right? There's no need to be such a dick. 
"Have you heard of impersonal questions? Your rant seems like you didn't get your cereal, to waste hundreds of letters just to show that someone is wrong but he isn't. "
"&gt; it's OK for people to call you offensive.

sadly, SJWs also think this comes with new laws/rules to somehow be punished for being offensive. that they can create actual limited speech zones- sorry ""safe spaces"" for themselves based just on their feelings"
"Nice anecdote, too bad the cheap tablet can do what your average computer needs better than a raspberry pi regardless of how much better the OS is.

What's your house made out of? 
The entire foundation of racism
Lol no they won't. They'll more than likely end up paying less than what you can get at a store. Reason being is everything that should be paid for after a hospital bill is negotiable. 
"There are a lot of reasons. I doubt you would give them any consideration given your the narrow minded view of what homophobia is. To put it bluntly, you are likely too far gone. I'm not going to waste my time discussing them in this medium. I've done it too many times before. Can't fix brainwashing this way."

"Well, I don't know what my chromosomes are and I'm not sure they're really relevant to healthcare. But yeah, I know it's best to tell doctors I was born male because it does matter sometimes. It's funny though, special snowflake-ness and special accommodation is actually the last thing I want. I don't want to say I wish I'd been born female, because that's just really depressing and I've learnt a lot from being transgender, but I do wish people didn't treat me any differently because of it. Of course, that isn't actually possible because sometimes it does make an unavoidable difference (e.g. healthcare or a relationship). My ideal response to coming out to someone would be ""oh ok, that doesn't change anything"". But I guess that probably sounds like wanting special snowflake accommodation to some people. And it is quite different from what a lot of people are used to, so maybe that's not surprising. Sorry I was sarcastic and rude before, I get tired of this stuff."

Or some of us don't like to have our phones blasted 24/7 with pictures of our friends doing mundane every day shit.
"Once asked a cop to give me my bong back. She replied ""no, that would be like giving a cocaine addict his needle back.""

What is this? The 19th century? Did she have a lot of folks mixing up a 7% solution? Did Sherlock Holmes personally make a fool out of her on her last case? Was she aware of how people do drugs these days?

Anyway didn't get it back, but I did get a ticket and a warning to not be such a stupid little smartass."

Nice.  Lol.  Where are you from? 
Are you actually saying we should have killed millions more? Are you a gigantic asshole or just totally ignorant of history? 
It's the countries own fault for letting them all in 
"Hmmm maybe just maybe a certain supremacist ideology know asislam might be responsible. You cannot ""educate"" or reason with a Muslim. Very naive on your end. Very child like thinking.

Bring the downvotes. I keep forgetting Buddhists, Sikhs , Christians committed 9/11, fort hood, Orlando , Paris , San Bernardino, Nice etc. likewise Isis clearly isn't Muslim either"
"The guy we're talking about here was born in the country this took place in. Immigration, one way or another, did not come into play. It's ridiculous to suggest otherwise."
You are a Muslim apologist. You justified the attack in your first sentence. Shameful. 
There it is! One comment in and we have an apologist.
He's just trying to explain the rising tension there.
I'm a piece of shit AMA
No. I wouldn't be hurting a person. A being like that doesn't deserve to be called human or a person. They are more worthless than animals and I kill mosquitoes for stinging me every day without feeling bad about it.

"How do you know that? They might as well be Christians trying to denounce the faith. They even attacked Indonesia once (January), the largest Muslim country on Earth, but for what? Simply put, there are no real evidence they are Muslims."
"Stop interfering in the Middle East. 
Taliban was created by the US. 
ISIS was a result of Iraq War (that was based on a lie), in which 3,50,000 Muslims died. 
US and UK did in the Iraq war what Hitler and Mussolini did with the League of Nations in WW2. 
Libya and Syria are fucked because some countries put their noses where it didn't belong. 
Stop the stereotyping and propaganda against the Muslim community."
"Good or authentic? ( I'd have a problem eating dog or cat meat, but that is just me)."

&gt; Really? Have you talked to a lot of third wave feminists and SJWs? There's no reasoning with many of them. It's like talking to a ~~cultist~~ terrorist.
"""A"" scholarship. 

That's not going to cut it.

Apply apply apply. Get more scholarships.

I was making money off of scholarships. There's no reason you should owe money after college unless you want to pay extra to go to a university you barely qualify for."
