"""Tourist"" will ruffle some feathers."
"No, because nobody cares how many packages I get or who comes over or when I go out. People usually mind their own business, this isn't some small town in Georgia. On top of that, you can build a relationship with your doorman. Furthermore, it means that random strangers won't be able to steal your packages."
"Nope. Wouldn't believe them, and most likely their plan for ""funding"" would be some kind of bullshit privatization because a Republican who actually wants to govern properly and strengthen public/governmental institutions would not receive the support of the Republican party in the first place."
"I saw a guy in Herald Square call another guy a ""goof"" after he bumped into him by accident, and I've never seen someone go from zero to spitting ballistic so quickly.

Who knew ""goof"" could cut so deep?"
"It costs about $20, depending on the dollar amount you're suing for.  They don't take credit cards.  Bring cash.

You only get a tiny space to scribble the nature of the claim.  Make sure you can summarize in 8 words or less.

Check the calendar of the relevant county.  Although SC clerks are nominally open 9-5, they have customary break periods (usually noonish) and ""reserved for pressing court matters"" periods (usually after 3pm).

Your slot on the docket will be 6-10 weeks from the date of filing.  Usually posted on the outside of the office, so you can check w/o waiting in line.  You can get the general parameters of SC scheduling in your county (eg ""Thursday night court"" or ""Tuesday day court"") from the web.

The clerk will give you a handbook.  Also available online: http://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/pdfs/smallclaimshandbook.pdf"
"How would they fund it? Cut education, Medicaid, etc?"
It says 'in places where smoking is prohibited.' Smoking is prohibited in the subway.
"Only on the beach.

Just the thought of wearing open toed shoes around the city makes me gag."
Whoa buddy. Don't you ever want to own a home?
This may have started sometime last year... but pok√© is pretty popular
"I don't give a shit about some TimeOut blog monkey's opinions - it's NYC, wear whatever the fuck you want on your feet.

I've worn them occasionally, but haven't done in a while. If I ever stepped in one of those puddles of brown gunge leaking out of trash bags on the curb, I'd chop my fucking foot off right there in the street."
"The fucking doorman at 1WTC said 'welcome to New York! Where are you from?' when I walked buy a few weeks ago. 

Made me irrationally angry. "
"""Go back to Ohio"" seems like something we throw around a lot. "
"I generally avoid wearing flip flops in the city, don't give a crap what other people do unless they're coming up and rubbing their feet on me."
"Lol. You have no idea the environments we work in, so how could you possibly judge this?"
"Try AAA Avocados, 135 Christie St.

Jersey City.
"http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1591/electronic-cigarettes-law

Electronic cigarettes are included in the Smoke-Free Air Act. You are not allowed to use an e-cigarette in places where smoking is prohibited, including bars, restaurants, offices, parks, and beaches."
"I blocked the Bay Ridge troll but I see there is 1 comment posted that I cannot see. I bet everything I own that he brought up speed dating.

To actually answer you, yes, people still use OkCupid, there are a lot of active users in your range. "
"New Yorkers always bitch about the subway. It's different this time in that it's pretty widespread, but there's always a line or two that's being bitched about."
I've always found casual sex and recreational drug use create some lasting friendships.
"""You forget yourself, sir!"""
"Go to Six Flags, it's no Cedar Point but nothing is. Nothing else comes close, and will disappoint. It's about 90 mins from NYC

"Another driver cursed me out in Hungarian.  He nearly had a stroke when I responded in Hungarian.  This was all because when I lived in a graduate students dorm, we all decided one night over some beers to further world peace and understanding by teaching each other curses."
"Check out r/nycbeer  

Brooklyn brewery is just your typical brewery at this point and more of a tourist destination than anything. 

This list is wildly incomplete,  ut for starters: Check out Other Half Brewing, Threes Brewing in Brooklyn. In Queens check out Big Alice, Transmitter Brewing and Rockaway Brewing Co, all in Long Island City, which is a neighborhood in Queens. In Manhattan there are some really good beer bars and bottle shops, personally I like Rattle and Hum on 33rd and 5th and Ginger Man on 36th(maybe). Rattle and Hum West is around 37th Ave, and usually has a distinct menu from the one on 33rd, but last I went they didn't do flights. "
"&gt; Furthermore, it means that random strangers won't be able to steal your packages.

This is the best part."
Nope. Everyone who lives here only has children if they make over $500k/year or their kids go to Murder High. 
"Maybe he's never seen smoked salmon? If you've never had much money, smoked salmon isn't one of the things you would buy or think about."
"you can just take a regular nyc taxi. follow signs in the terminal for the taxi stand. 

i've never taken a taxi from the airport to elmont but i'm pretty certain the taxi is almost always going to be less money than the airline change fee, unless you're traveling very far from the airport/far into the suburbs. elmont is also right by JFK so i'm sure it won't be very much money. "
"&gt; Who knew ""goof"" could cut so deep?

Goof is about the biggest insult someone can call another person in prison. If you were to be called a goof in prison, you would need to immediately fight that person or be known as a little bitch for the remainder of your stretch.

Unfortunately some people cannot make the distinction between being in prison and being out in society.

Or perhaps the guy in Herald Square knew what he was doing when he called the guy a goof, which is why the other dude peaked so fast

Pro Tip: Be careful when throwing around the term Goof"
"it's more likely that he never wanted/needed food, but was hoping that someone would give him money 'to buy food'. i have had many people who were outside holding signs asking for ""money for something to eat"" turn down food that I would buy and give to them. like, what the fuck

the reality is that NYC is one of the most generous cities in the USA when it comes to feeding the homeless and destitute. if one seeks out the government, it's pretty easy to feed yourself in this city.

money to keep up your habit on the other hand, that's harder to come by..."
You don't buy a week's worth of groceries at a time.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
"Presumably, the city will hire professionals to do this rather some random people with a penchant for explody thing.

[There are plenty of examples of building implosions happening next to other buildings](http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/news/2014/08/23/downtown-albany-building-implodes.html).  It's not so much a giant explosion as an orchestrated series of small explosions that do things like cut the supporting columns so that the structure collapses in a predictable way."
You need to buy a ticket at the machines near the stop. Doing what you're doing is going to get you hit with $100 fine eventually.
You're mistaking your income as an excuse not to budget. Head over to /r/personalfinance and read the sidebar to understand how to make and maintain a budget that compromises your paycheck with your debts and lifestyle.
Stay away. You don't need a broker to move in with a roommate.
"You must be delightful to work for.

Have fun with your real, serious company. I'll continue to work at my not-serious company that doesn't give too many thoughts to how people are dressed as long as they are not offending others (and I don't mean with their toenail polish colors).

 I'll remind my friends at Facebook and Google that they're not working at ""real, serious"" companies, either.

I don't run a fast-food restaurant- we don't need uniforms. "
"It's fuckin weird to give a homeless person smoked salmon. 


But yea, I've encountered homeless not picky but particular about they want. I notice this at my morning coffee cart when someone offers to buy them coffee/pastry. "
"This almost sounds like satire. I have never heard of this flip flop aversion in my whole life born and raised in NYC. I wore them running errands, going to class, to work to change into my heels. Who gives a shit about this besides some insular troglodyte."
Rolled ice cream seems to be trendy
... Are you all taking your flip-flops off and smushing your bare feet into the subway grime? I don't see the issue. Get ones that fit and don't fall off and it's no more gross than anything else. 
"Why is East New York in Brooklyn, but West New York is in NJ?"
I believe he posts in here pretty often about the dinners and receives good response. 
"If he photographed your family members and gave the photos to management, it should be pretty easy to prove that they're your family members, right? Just show management other photos of them that prove that they're the same people."
