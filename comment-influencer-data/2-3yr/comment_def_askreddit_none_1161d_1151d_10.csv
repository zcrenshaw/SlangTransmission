"Thank you. I will say this- when my mom was dying of cancer, I made her a promise that I would get my degree and not end up in prison like my birth father (he passed in prison several years after my birth mother passed). Though it would have been easy to fall into crime when I was desperate, I have always kept that promise in my mind. 

It def wasn't easy but being able to look back at what I've achieved and know that I can pay my bills at the end of the day makes keeping that promise so worthwhile. "
