"First, please know that it's okay to not be okay.  Don't bottle this up.  When you need to cry, then cry.  Doesn't matter where you are, who you're with, or what you're doing.  Trust me, they will understand.

Second, you're allowed to feel however you want.  Crushed at losing her?  Go right ahead.  Pissed at her for not being more cautious?  Perfectly fine.  You.  Are not.  Dishonoring her memory.  By feeling how you feel.  Okay?

Third, don't shut out your support system.  Let your friends and family be there for you.  It's okay to need.

Fourth, find counseling.  Seriously.  There's this weird stigma attached to it, I know.  But ignore that bullshit and find someone impartial to talk to.  Go once.  Then keep going.  I promise it will help.

Four-B, you need to forgive yourself.  What happened was not your fault.  'If I'd only's' and 'What if's' will crush you.  This is not going to be an overnight process, and counseling will help with it 

Finally, you're going to be okay.  I know that right now it doesn't seem like it.  Fine seems like the furthest thing from you right now.  But I promise that, over time, the bitterness of grief fades into an ache of longing.  But not in a bad way. Grief is the price we pay for experiencing true love.  The love you shared and the influence she had on you will pop up in day to day love in small ways and remind you of how truly blessed you were to have those years together. 

If you ever need a friendly ear to bend, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Edit: added Four-B"
Most guys don't put nearly as much effort into their attractiveness as the women they think they deserve to date.  
"I dont think they should lower physical requirements for certain jobs to accommodate women who may want to get into the job. 

The physical requirements should fit what the job entails, and if anyone can't pass it, regardless of gender, that job is not for them. "
"You go from pew to pew pew. No need to recock for the second pew so it's a straight up pew pew instead of pew...pew. It's efficient if you're going for the pew pew. However, if just pew suits your needs, there's no real need to upgrade. I would, however, suggest that if you are staying with the single pew, adding the friendly wink (not suggestive wink, **friendly**) to the single pew for enhanced effect. 

Edit: Forgot the second question. I switched to pew pew a while back and I'm a fan, but every so often a situation calls for a pew friendly wink. Read the room and act accordingly. Just remember, just cause you have two doesn't mean you always need to use two. "

"Double barrel is absolutely what it's all about.  I've been finger gunning for years, and I can say double is definitely better.  A single barrel looks like a lame-ass attempt to point.  A double barrel means business.  Ain't nobody messing with a double barrel."
"I will only say unpopular things for male redditors otherwise it's not fun:

* One of the main reasons women are the gatekeeper of sex is because we allow them to be by being so obsessed with getting laid. 

* Related: this obsession with getting laid leads many young men around here to consider that *""women have it better""* simply because they can get sex more easily, disregarding tons of other important variables of life in which women are undeniably at a disadvantage. Their life goal is getting laid, so they think the one who gets sex more easily is the one who wins at life. 

* There's an extreme obsession with rationality among some men which leads them to prefer someone who thinks like an android/robot rather than someone who thinks like a human being. Emotions and empathy *are* valuable variables when making a decision, they are not incompatible with facts and I think cold pragmatism leads to pretty shitty and inhumane decisions. (ex: I see plenty of people on relationship topics focusing on who's right/wrong instead of trying to find the solution that is the best for the relationship and the people involved.)

* From personal experience, I believe that 95% of men/women differences are due to gender norms/societal constructs rather than biological reasons. I found myself thinking a lot ""like a woman"" when I found myself in situations mostly experienced by women. Consequently, I think anyone who tries to justify their views on gender relations with ""back when we were cavemen"" is an idiot (mostly because I've never seen someone make a solid argument when using that premise).

* Men who claim being an asshole is what get you laid are idiots incapable to combine being nice and being confident and will only land women who aren't worth it.

* Most men who complain about false rape accusation aren't even close to getting laid in the first place and aren't doing it because they care about men but as a way to discredit feminism and women's issues.

* Men associating meat with masculinity are playing the game of the meat industry without even realizing it. Meat tastes great but it doesn't make you more of a man, you're not hunting it in the woods with your spear. 

* Given the amount of effort the average woman puts in her appearance, men shouldn't be whining when asked to put some effort as well.

"
"It's typical one-sided thinking.  Do some men assume they know more shit about topic x than you because you're a woman and they're a man? Sure as fuck there are men like that.

Do some women do the same thing, about traditionally female areas of expertise?  As a former full time stay at home dad, I can tell you, there are plenty of women who do that."
"""Not financially ready"" is the most commonly cited reads for women of all ages and colors when seeking an abortion.

Men who are not financially ready for a baby are told to man up and go find a better job, like, often times flippantly, ""Well you were ready for sex, so get ready for child support."""
It is lower than you thnik.
Think about football. All those men running around in tight pants and slapping each others asses usually does it for me.
Water.
Too many guys are just beyond desperate and its pitiful to watch. 
"""You have to stop looking; I promise that the perfect girl with come to you eventually.""

The promise/guarantee is what makes it so ridiculously absurd"
"Generally women's advice works if you interpret it in the most abstract, least literal way possible. 

Like just be yourself means ""be a different, better, more attractive person and then be completely true and genuine to who you are - after you've made that ""you"" an object of value.""

Or ""I like nerdy guys."" It means ""I like guys who are fit, attractive, socially competent, and conventionally ""cool"" while simulaneously differentiating themselves by having a few niche hobbies / passions / driving a tesla."" 

""I like chivalrous guys"" means ""I like guys who treat me like a normal human and get a chill, fun, vibe going with a little sexual tension, but occasionally do sweet things to make me feel like it's a date, not a chill sesh. 

""You shouldn't workout I don't like muscular guys, it's gross"" means don't look like Kai Greene, but do workout because Hugh Jackman as wolverine turns my panties into soup, and I think that muscles like that grow magically without weights.""

""I don't care about a guy's job / wealth, it doesn't matter to me""  means ""I am not looking to gold-dig, but I do want to date someone who has a career that at least allows him to live a good, comfortable lifestyle. You don't need to be a banker, but have your own crib, car, decent clothes, and ambition."" 

""Don't hit on me in X or Y or Z situation"" means ""don't hit on me in X or Y or Z situation unless you are proportionately attractive enough relative to the situation."" 

So it's not that female advice is wrong, it just... has to be interpretted correctly. "
It works for women because a majority of them don't initiate shit so they think it works the other way around too
"Ok you ready?  I'm a veteran, son.

1. Don't let your dick run your life.

2. Don't stay with a woman if you're not feeling the relationship just because you're afraid to hurt her by breaking up.  Your happiness matters.

2a. And for fuck's sake don't marry her either.  You'll only end up being a gigantic turd rather than a little pea-sized turd... or else stuck in a miserable marriage.

3.  DO stick your dick in crazy.  There are some good times to be had there.  Just bring your own condoms and use them, and don't give her your home address if you can help it.  It's like the rodeo: ride it until shit becomes too dangerous, then fuck right off as quickly as possible and let some other clown handle her.

4.  The pumice soap LAVA is excellent at washing away / masking early-in-the-day sex with a girl, in preparation for sex with a different later-in-the-day girl.  Likely any good deodorant soap will do, but Lava is the best.  Avoid plain ass soap.

5.  When you're financially and geographically able, get yourself a dog.  ~~Get a dog that will, at adulthood, weigh more than 30 pounds.~~   Experience unmitigated love and joy.

5a.  When your dog has reached the end of his or her life, do not draw the process out unnecessarily.  Use good judgement, keep them as long as you can while they are still happy, but do not prolong any suffering for purely selfish reasons.  Letting them go at the proper time and with minimal suffering is your last gift to them.  And, as hard as it is, be there with them.  You will not regret it later in life. 

6.  A college education CAN be beneficial to your career, but you need not have one to succeed.  Especially if your family is not well-off enough to cover the cost (or unless you have a full scholarship, etc).  Avoid becoming a career student.

7.  Learn how to fight.  Anything will do really, just spend some time learning the basics, I recommend Krav Maga.  You need not be some MMA bruiser, and at some point, those lessons may save your life or the life of an innocent.

8.  Learn how to handle a firearm, even if you have no intention of using one.  Even if you're terrified of them.  Especially if you're terrified of them.  You don't have to be a gun nut or even keep a gun, but knowing how to use one is proper knowledge.

9.  Getting married?  DO NOT rush into parenthood.  Spend some years doing the DINK thing, and make sure you are both mentally and financially prepared for the shitstorm.

10.  Not feeling the whole parenthood thing?  Like, ever, in the foreseeable future?  Consider getting a vasectomy, you can pay a very modest fee and have some sperm frozen in case you ever really want to have your own kids.  A vasectomy opens up ALL KINDS of cool options, and it's really the best birth control out there apart from a woman getting a hysterectomy.

"&gt;know that it's okay to not be okay

some of the best advice of my life here. Sitting around thinking you need to be strong, is sometimes the wrong thing to do. Let it out, emotions need to be expressed. You're no less a person if you spend a day crying. 

If there are people you can chat to, share thoughts with, please do it OP. If there isn't, then I can lend an ear for you. "

"Not in the weirdly aggressive SJW sense you see on Reddit but I had a friend whose wife was a stay at home mom and pretty proud about it. The trouble was that she actually didn't do anything-his kid was usually left to herself, the house was filthy nonstop, she never bought groceries so they lived on fast food, etc etc. He stayed constantly stressed.

So one day we were talking and she mentioned something about guys who were unemployed-which I was at the time-and I asked her when she last worked. Not in a smart ass way, just casually threw it out there. She went off on a rant about how she worked twice as hard as any man staying at home cooking, cleaning, taking care of the kid, etc. I told her single people had to do all of that *in addition* to working full time jobs and stressing over bills.

Apparently that was super sexist to her because she told me that I'd never find a girl until my attitudes towards women changed. 

Probably the only time I've ever been accused of being misogynistic but I found it more funny than anything else."
"They're extremely privileged when it comes to dating and sex. This privilege stems mainly from the difference in how males and females experience attraction and difference in sex drive between the sexes.

"You really gotta ask yourself what you're wanting in a fingergun though. I mean if you're just gonna be using it to shoot at your boss on the way to the bathroom once or twice a week, do you really need the extra barrel? You have to factor in all the extra cleaning time and more expensive safe storage. Alternatively, are you planning for home defense or hitting ladies night downtown? Maybe the double-barrel is a better choice for you because, as /u/B0000000BS said, they simply are more impressive. They pack a bigger punch. You might be able to bag a cute, quiet artsy girl with a single barrel but if you're wanting to seal the deal with a strong woman pushing 30 who makes 70k a year doing what she loves, you're DEFINITELY gonna need a double-barrel.

On top of that, the way things are going you gotta ask how much longer you'll be able to conceal/carry the doublebarrel. The singlebarrels are probably fine because they're much more compact, but people are just straight up frightened of the doublebarrel fingerguns. Like you said, it shows you mean business.

What you should actually do is research the laws and ordinances in your city, county, and state, then figure out for what purpose you actually NEED the double-barrel and, if a single barrel fits all of your needs, it would be a cheaper and more efficient alternative."
"There are people who are being condescending out of sexism, but I don't use that term because I can't know what's in someone's mind. 

I work in a male-dominated profession. I've worked with a couple women over the years that assumed every guy who treated them poorly was sexist. I think that's a bit of a leap. I'll assume someone's an equal opportunity asshole until they prove different."
"If you're going to ask a girl out on a date, **have a plan.**   None of this ""Wanna go out some time?"" shit.

Say something like, ""I'd like to take you out to &lt;insert restaurant name&gt; next Thursday night, can you make it?"" Then shut your mouth.  *Let her answer.* 

She will either:

a) Lie/Stammer:  Most girls don't want to hurt your feelings so they'll says something like, ""I, er, uh, my uh, schedule...""  This means she's not interested. 

b) Counter:  She might say she can't make it, but she's free on Saturday or something.  This is great, she's likely interested.

Or of course, she might just say yes.   Best case scenario.

Edit:  If she says she has a boyfriend, tell her he's a very lucky guy and move on. No shenanigans.

&gt; ""Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

&gt; I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.
As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. 

&gt; Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

&gt; Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

&gt; Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."" - /u/GSnow

"A guy posted at one point (I think r/Feminism, but idk for sure) that a girl he was on a date with called him sexist after he told her he had a grant from the National Science Foundation to do research.

Pretty sure anyone who just said NSF would just get blank looks and requests for elaboration since there are a ridiculous number of organizations with the same/similar acronyms.

Edit: Wow, this shot up FAST. I posted so late I didn't expect to get 330 upvotes in 20 hours (humblebragging here). Regardless, the comment by u/versusChou makes a lot of sense. Being in the scientific community and mentioning the NSF would automatically mean the National Science Foundation.

Also, I'm a feminist. Quite frankly, even if it isn't justified, that isn't feminism. That's a bastardized version that's twisted into an excuse to act like a brat and get away with it.

" In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion."

"One of the toxicities of feminism has been its ability to convince an entire generation of relatively well-of women (modern, U.S. women, in my case) that the way a man sits on a bus is somehow the same as deep, systemic, horrific injustice similar to, you know, genital mutilation, being forced into/ out of motherhood, being married as a young girl.

Then he started telling me how he went through a period of time where he would go to parties and hooked up with a lot of girls but ended up being really lonely because every guy saw him as a competition.

My shot had gone clean through the cinderblock wall, through a sheet of metal on a milling machine and through the operator's leg, taking it clean off at the knee. He bled out before help could arrive, and I was arrested. Since it was an accident, I only did 4 years for manslaughter, but I had to surrender my guns. Now I'm typing this with my penis, and regretting every day that I upgraded.

"If you want to cover your body in tattoos, that's totally your right to do so, but personally I think you're making your body uglier.

Also, a lot of you need to learn what time means.  When I ask ""How much time do you need to get ready?"" I am not asking for a list of what you need to do before you're ready, as I have no idea how long straightening your hair takes.  If I ask for an amount of time, I'm asking for a number."
"Just like men, most have no idea what they want"
"I think there's a contradictory narrative about whether men should approach women in public. I hear a lot of women talk about how they see guys they're interested in, and rather than making a move, just hope that he approaches them. But if a guy they're not interested does something as mundane as say hello, it can be equated with sexual harassment/assault."
"Ay grl, u sit in sum sugar?

"In high school when I started trying harder to look better, guys started calling me gay and making fun of me... Which was funny, considering I was one of the only guys with a girlfriend. "
"Men do not like to consider outbursts of anger as being emotional or dramatic because they do not want to be thought of as emotional or dramatic like they purport women to be. And what is this about punching walls when they are angry? How is that not being emotional. Simmer the fuck down and cool your jets man, that is totally drama-queen behavior with a side helping of property damage.

You guys also give a lot of crappy advice to the chicks asking for help here, as much as places like Askwomen would to men. I think a lot of people place themselves in the position of the men in provided scenarios instead of the women and think in terms of personal benefit instead of what is good for the girl hence why there is so much ""go for the shy, nerdy guys"" and cajoling to put our early or date in the friend group. Its not always bad advice, but given the luxury of asking for personalized advice compared against AW you would expect fewer generalized, biased platitudes. I think places like AW give advice from a position of what is socially acceptable *within the community* (thus often inapplicable to women not a part of it) even if the woman feels ambivalent about it to save face and overall being soft about things that might be offensive. AM cares less about offending people but is more likely to give advice from a position of personal benefit (""it benefits me for girls to put out quickly so that is the advice I will give""). Compare that against AW shrieking something about the importance of confidence in a man while deigning to say ""no fatties"" because its too mean even if the poster might think it true."

"Nofap...I tried it for the first time a few years ago on a lark.  For some context I've had ED issues off and on for much of my adult life and until relatively recently I'd never tried regulating my, uhh, fapping.  Anyway I went three weeks without any sort of release once...the first week or so was hard (disregard the pun) but after that it was manageable.  Anyway by the time I had sex I had nofapped for about 3 weeks and the experience totally changed my life.  Forgive the graphic description, but I was harder than I'd been in years-- without any foreplay, and not only that I stayed hard and managed to contain myself for about 20 min or so before having one of the greatest orgasm's of my life.  I had assumed that with the nofap it would have been a ""one pump dump"" sort of scenario but that's not what happened at all-- I was able to control myself rather well and this drove the girl I was with nuts (in a good way).  I could literally feel bolts of energy radiating from the tip of junior while I was inside her, it was incredible and I've been a convert ever since.  **Edit:**  I don't know why I'm being downvoted, this was genuine advice and I encourage anyone who is having ED issues to try it-- ED ruined my self esteem for many years and this experience made me feel like a new man and also that I'd lost very little of the virility and stamina of my youth (I'm 40)...so to those with an open mind, try it out...it may change your life (and don't let the fact that you feel like you're going to explode for the first few days dissuade you-- that's just due to habit and it goes away.)"

"As a gender they may be more abusive than men. 

Men probably commit more physical abuse, and even if they don't when they do it is a lot worse in terms of damage inflicted, but I think women are much more skilled at psychological and verbal abuse and wield it more frequently. 

I don't have a source or study, just my gut feeling based on what I've seen in my life. "
"Two things:

Men are way more like women than different. We are just raised to assume exactly opposite roles in society.

And, tangentially related to that? There are WAY more submissive men than we let on. The idea that men are inherently dominant is... a bit of an over-simplification.

Tea. I drink like 50 cups a day. 
"The notion that men are somehow evolutionarily or biologically inclined to ""bring home the bacon"" and earn all the money. 

It seems like nowadays so many women both want to be treated as equals to men and yet want to be with a ""real man"".

As women have entered the labor market in greater numbers, it has resulted in more competition and greater pressure for men to maintain a foothold on their place in society because we are bred to think that's all we are... a fucking wallet. 

And if your manhood is inextricably bound to your income? What good are you if you're laid off or fired?

What bothers me is that there seems to be such a clash where there's the idea that women need to be equal in terms of income and yet it still persists that so many people think men still have to pay for a vast, vast majority of the shit.

I DO think women should have every single opportunity to hold down every single job that men do. However? If you're going to fight to be CEO and you're making more than me?

Then don't expect me to pay for you. Maybe I got myself. But if you're independent, then pay for your own side. 

Beyond that, don't hold that shit over my head. I've dated women that make more money than me. And they hold that shit over my head. In essence, ""my house, my money, my rules"".

And it fucked me up so much because I don't want to be someone else's bitch. So I basically just started learning different ways I might be able to live out of my car.

Would probably rather die than not even be respected as a person because of some arbitrary allocation of income based upon what's considered ""valued"" at the time. (My grandpa once said that people scoffed at him for wanting to be an engineer way back in the day. Don't hear that much now.)

I support women's *equality*. But emphasis on that term. Equality. 

If you're going to want to move forward? Then don't pick and choose and hold onto traditional notions that benefit you, while getting rid of all the ones that don't.

One way or the other, on this issue, IMO."

"I'm a professional drummer, and I was doing a rare all ages gig that my (at the time) 16 year old stepdaughter was at. There were these guys who were maybe 24 trying to hit on her. After she walked away I went up to them. This was after our set so they knew I was in the band. I said ""she's pretty good looking huh?"". They both agreed, some lewd comments from them followed. As I was laughing I looked them in the eye and said, ""yeah, you know what though? She's 16, and my stepdaughter. So you better forget you saw her"". They apologized profusely and left. I then had an interesting talk with her after that. She told me she didn't really want to be talking to them and she felt uncomfortable, but didn't want to hurt their feelings and didn't know how to handle it. Basically she didn't want to be a bitch. I had a long talk with her about establishing boundaries and sticking to them, and gave her some tips about how to handle those situations, and said being a bitch was more than ok if they're not respecting your boundaries. She's now 21 and has told me multiple times how much that conversation has helped her out. She really hasn't had a problem since. I ended up being really glad that situation happened and I was there!"

"Yes. For me, I think it's something like this:

When I was very young, my mother used to stroke my head sometimes to comfort me. Then began the long period between being too old for that kind of touching from family, and not being in any close enough relationships yet for anyone else to touch me in close/intimate/comforting ways. Then, finally, that period devoid of touch came to an end, when I had my first sexual relationship.

Being touched that way now connects the two endpoints in my head: it brings back an old, familiar, formative sense of care and comfort, and also reminds me that I don't have to be without it any more."

Those muffled screams - the hottest thing ever, came fast after that."

"Environmental studies student here. Let's see what I can write before I need to go to a thing.

Climate change has been called ""the perfect problem"". It's effects arn't seen for decades after the fact. The required actions seem extreme and expensive. And the consequences are so dire that people quickly toss it into the ""things that'll eventually happen but that won't happen in my life time"".

Currently we're in the 6th mass extinction event where almost all biodiversity is on he decline. Scientists have set 2050 as the ""very possible last second to save it all"" with a substantial faction calling it over optimistic and saying that we've already passed that mark. 

Despite the impending deadline, you have views similar to the comments in this thread. ""It's a media scare."" ""Humans will survive, we're tough like that."" ""I think if they just look at X, then they could solve it."" Not realizing just how much study has already been done on the subject. Space won't save us. We're laughably far away from any kind of ""Mars recolonization plan"", our current agriculture industry is intierally reliant on unsustainable monoculture practices built to ensure that certain corporations stay firmly in the driver seat. And most of our construction is unsustainable and all most impossible to breakdown.

What happens in the next 80 years will determine the fate of the earth and every organism living on it. Either we will see the most amazing unification of humanitarian efforts to revolutionize all facets of society and bring about a new sustainable society or we will watch as the world fights over and squanders the remaining resources, leaving behind a polluted, trash ridden husk to try again in another million years or so.

Some things that need to happen:

No more children. It's already been proven that today's population can not live a decent livelihood without either massive wealth inequality or everyone having a very subpar life. We're expected to almost double it by the end of the century and jump up to 10billion. There will not be enough resources to maintain these people. So either we restrict our own births now, or we get to enjoy the many wonders of extream overpopulation and poverty up close.

Peak Water. Peak water is terrifying. It's the idea that supply finally begins to dwindle, driving up demand. We currently get water from 3(ish) sources. Weather, aquifers, and Rivers. Now Aquifers are underground lakes that were built by rainfall hundreds of years ago. They're little outlets of clay in the earths surface. But once you use it up, the clay hardens and cracks and it's impossible for the area to serve as an aquifer. Thanks to our use of cement, a lot of rain that might have recharged the aquifers in past years, has sadly gone down the storm drains. What water we can collect from the rain and snow, is laughbly small compaired to what we need on a yearly basis. And we have already successfully dried up the Colorado river due to water harvesting. (It no longer reaches to the sea in the summer.) Peak water is natures hard set deadline. We **have** to have changed our lives styles before this time or nature will force a massive die off on the simple grounds of there not being enough fresh water to keep people alive.

"I think it has a fair origin, specifically men being patronizing or condescending to women because they are women. I've seen that specific brand of patronizing enough to see why feminists might want to point it out specifically.

But it's completely lost it's use and now is just a garbage term used to invalidate men's opinions on things. It's now just a tool to derail discussions because a term like that is best used to talk about things in an academic sense, not to call out people on twitter."
Or they celebrate the fact that women are now a majority in tertiary education. Okay but that means men are a minority. Is that any better than the opposite? Obviously 50/50 is impossible but it should be close... People seem to think as long as women aren't underrepresented that's OK

"Ughhhhhh I hate when people act like every choice a woman makes is inherently a feminist choice just because she's a woman. Dressing in a a way that's sexually appealing to men- ""But I'm showing off my body for ME""!; conforming to religious dress codes that have really patriarchal roots- ""Don't tell a woman she can't cover her head, if her God tells her that she's a slutty slut if she doesn't cover her head!! That's her right as a woman to believe in that woman- hating God !""; being a stay at home mom - ""It's my right as a woman to choose house keeping and child rearing over being a productive member of society!"" 

I'm not knocking any of these choices- dress the way you want, do what you want. But don't try to make yourself feel less guilty about your choices in life by lying to yourself about the impact socialization of gender has on your decisions. You aren't doing these things because they're ""empowering"" and ""feminist."" Own up to the fact that there are problematic causes driving your choices and just do what you want without justifying it with feminism.

I am the most die-hard feminist there is, and I feel naked and ugly if I don't paint my face with red lipstick. My relationship follows very traditional gender roles. I can recognize that this is because of the society I was raised in, and I don't try to pretend that my choices are made in a vacuum where gender does not exist. I feel like it would be insulting to feminism and all that women have fought for to say that I wear makeup and like my man to slap me around because that's my super feminist girl power choice."

Like most things, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Each of those issues affect certain men more or less than others.

"Majority of men overestimate their physical attractiveness.

""I'm good looking bruh but I'm unpopular with women because I'm shy/poor.""

Trust me, women flock to good looking men who are poor as fuck and shy. If they arent, you are not as good looking as you think you are. 

If you are a man and reading this, 9 out of 10 you are average at best and women on the streets wont look twice at you if they dont know you. Just because you are not fat and not super short doesnt mean you are handsome. And having six pack and muscles dont really hide your fuckin average face. 

And if you think you are ugly/fat/short, you are not as ugly as you think you are. Women only notice (physically, before they know your personality) the super good looking guy. The rest are average. So in fact, you are as good looking as majority of men out there.

"Honestly any job that if your physical strength could compromise the safety of others, there should be no difference in requirements. I think including women in infantry is great, but my brother is in the military so if some woman comes along and can't pull her weight because they bent the rules to let her in and ends up getting my brother or anyone's brother or son or father killed then it is 200% not worth it.

She genuinely loves me for who I am, not who I am going to be or who I might become, but ME, NOW.  And that scares the shit out of me.  I worry all the time about ""The other shoe dropping"" and her realizing that my self image is more accurate than what she sees.  She says that's not going to happen, and I know I will NEVER EVER be complete without her.  "

I don't like myself when I don't spank the monkey... 
"Almost any advice given to men by a girl about dating is bad. Women really have no clue how the dating scene functions for men, and they always give advice that puts themselves in the drivers seat.

The best example is, ""Just tell her you like her and ask her out, don't hold back your feelings!"". This is usually pretty bad advice. What the girl giving it is really trying to say is ""Tell me how you feel so that I can make a decision about whether or not I like you"". She doesn't actually want you to open up, she just wants to be in the position of power.

Another good example is when girls say something like ""Just get to know me and talk to me a lot before we do anything romantic"". She *thinks* that's what she wants, but in reality if you treat a girl like a friend she will become your friend. The girl is actually attracted to the guy who is romantic and confident, but she doesn't realize it.

Lastly, any sort of ""be yourself"" or ""just do what feels natural"". Girls give you this advice, and most advice in general because they don't have any vested interest in your success. They don't want guys to figure out how to work a women and get better women then they naturally would.

Girls don't care if men are good with women, so they give tips that benefit themselves, not men."

"Just anecdotally, in my own life, it seems I know a lot more women who are bad sports than men who are bad sports. I have wondered if there's something in how we're raised that teaches men how to compete more thoroughly than it does women. 

Competition involves being a good loser as well as a good winner. Picking up after a defeat and striving to get better. Being self-aware about where you need to improve. Accepting criticism. 

It's one of the things that makes me quite leery of our modern ""everyone gets a trophy"" atmosphere. We should be teaching kids to compete, even when in the short term they might get upset when they're beaten. "

**Focus on professional development**:  In high school own your grades, in college do something practical with a career path, in the working world you are entitled to nothing- get a good sponsor for your career and work hard to make them successful.

**Focus on interpersonal development**:  Dating is an apprenticeship without a master and without clear process, so learn from experience.  Rejection is an opportunity to learn, not to be bitter.  Success does not entitle you to anything but learning how to make a better relationship.  To ultimately ""win"" you need lots of practice.  Need a little emotional distance?  View dating an relationships in your teenage and early twenties as practice and practice makes perfect.  Also, learn to be a friend.  So important to have good friends.

**Focus on yourself**:  Learn to be strong and disciplined.  Start in your teenage years building the the essential life practices that will lead to longevity and satisfaction.  do something healthy -- lift, do cardio, do interactive sports.  Team sports that end when high school ends are nice but lifting, running and so forth are the basis for life practices.  

Learn about the 3 kinds of money and the balance that does with that money.  Learn to have folding cash, short term savings and one-way money.  folding cash to get a beer with your friends, savings to meet mid-term objectives and cover life's little shocks; One way money so you can retire rich (long term investing, 401K, Roth IRA and how to invest in the markets are essential life skills).

There's much more in the details but those are the 3 pillars I subscribe to as a successful, long term married adult."

"I dunno it's kinda like u/ZeeX10 said above. I think women are more attracted to the personality traits that will get someone further in life career wise such as confidence, motivation, grooming, etc. And while I don't deny there are women out there just looking for a meal ticket, these traits are more likely to be possessed by men who have been more successful. I  I can say with 100% honesty that I do not care at all how much someone makes as long as they're making an effort to better themselves.

"I've had a couple instances over the years of actual overt sexism, like a man actually saying to my face he thinks I'm not capable of doing what I do because I'm a woman. Unless someone actually explicitly states they have a problem with me because I'm a woman, I'm not going to paint the interaction with that brush.

Since I'm not looking for a sexist around every corner, it's been pretty easy for me to see that there are actually a lot more people in this industry that want to see me succeed than want to see me fail. People talk about STEM fields being hostile to women, but that hasn't been my experience in my little corner of the world. Sure, there have been a couple guys. Maybe there are a few more that secretly think it and aren't impolitic enough to say anything. I think, on an institutional level, there is plenty of support for me being here. It's just not something I worry about. I do my job. I work to get better. Most people are cool with me."
Yeah my first time I thought I was gonna end up reaching the asshole not even realizing they are basically bunk buddies. Just seems like poor placement to me.
Nobody is gonna judge a man for assuming the fetal position after a nasty strike to the nuts. I however would judge the shit out of a man who's reaction to being bagged is doing a slav squat while stretching out the waist of his pants. I just don't understand and you look like an idiot.
"Lady here weighing in. Honestly the outcome has a lot to do with the context.

If I'm out and about and someone approaches me and talks to me, is polite etc and they ask me out, I'm not bothered. Just explain that I'm flattered but I have called boyfriend (which I do) and tell them to have a nice day.

If I'm commuting home from work and I've got my headphones in and am giving strong ""don't talk to me"" signals, I won't be keen.

If it's late at night and I'm the only person on the bus, I will be uncomfortable.

If you touch me or make an inappropriate comment, I will tell you to go fuck yourself.

Context is important."

Suicide kills more men between 18-30 than drugs, motor accidents and illness combined. There's also been an increase in cancer deaths, or late stage cancer findings, because guys won't go to the doctor. 

I am a woman, just so this isn't thought of as a dig at women, but the whole ""aww look at the poor man, he's got man-flu"" thing? I hold that partially responsible, as it creates a thought, even if it's subconscious, in guys' head that they mustn't be as bad as they feel, and so they don't go to the doctors. A similar thing happens with mental health: guys think they're okay, since just because they feel down, they clearly aren't as bad as they think. "

"Nothing in real life that comes to mind, but when somebody in /r/askwomen asks who identifies as a feminist and who doesn't, there are always people who *insist* that any person, man or woman, who doesn't call themselves a feminist is automatically misogynistic, without exception. But contrary to what this sub will tell you, I find that the regulars there are, for the most part, pretty laid back and even the ones who are feminists don't judge people who aren't. 

Happened to me once when I stated why I don't and some idiot berated me about how misogynistic I was being. Fortunately since I didn't break any rules but she did (I think derailing or something) my comment stayed up but hers got removed. "

I'm a feminist but Jesus Christ, there are some proper toxic arseholes in the social justice community who seem to just have no way to channel their anger into something positive and are just in it for a fucking flame war.

This kind of thing's happened to me a few times now, and it's made me fear expressing any dissenting opinion in their little echo chambers for fear that anything I say will invoke accusations of mansplaining or whitesplaining or anything.

I don't think these people understand the idea that actively bullying privileged people into silence does nothing to help oppressed people."

"My SO and I were talking about this at a restaurant the other night.

She was basically looking around at these HOT moms: fit, made up, attractive, good clothes, and seeing their slouchy, pudgy husbands who had just let them go... litereally 4 or 5 different couples within view.

We talked about making a pact we would always take care of ourselves and let each other know if we thought the other was letting loose a little. "
"They're not nearly as bad or as difficult to deal with as much as the upvoted reddit comments claim they are. The vast majority of the complaints I see here are extremely rare, if not nonexistent in my life.

For the most part, the females I've seen and interacted with just seem like more people who dress differently, are typically smaller in bone and muscle structure, and use their emotions more often. The latter can be aggrivating, but mostly everything is down to everyone on an individual level. "
Too many of them inappropriately blame sexism for their problems: problems that men also face and/or problems that are self inflicted.
"Meh, if they're attractive, they're attractive. You don't really get to choose who you're attracted to. I know some 15 year olds that developed early and could pass for 18 or older. But having said that, you just need to know that it's inappropriate to date someone that is that young no matter how they look. They might be physically appealing, but mentally they are still maturing.

As you get older, your priorities and preferences for appearance will change. I'm almost 30, and while I can see the physical appeal of much younger girls, they're just not options for me anymore because I know that we're not going to have anything in common. Personality has become so much more important for me in terms of attraction. So just give it time."
"One time this girl on facebook posted this meme of a girl cringing with the text ""when he's under six foot"" and she was like ""omg so guilty of this.""

"Crazy died hair and facial piercings are not 'empowering.'  They're Dumbo's magic feather.

"That they can't raise kids as well as moms. It grinds my gears when I'll see a dad and his kids somewhere and someone has the nerve to say ""dad's turn to babysit"". No. He's being a parent just like their mother."
Men are just gossipy and backstabbing as women (*cough* Gove and Johnson). Some also have a real confirmation bias about it too and if they do acknowledge the gossip and backstabbing it gets explained away that the man must have reasons therefore it is legitimate.
Men are the causes of their own friendzone.
"Alternate genders and ""kin"" culture.

Im sure there are genders outside of the male/female binary, but the hundreds that have been invented on different sites all seem like different names for the same thing, or the same basic genders mixed with a personality trait that has nothing to do with sexuality. 

Also kin culture, I moderate a forum where a woman is a ""cat-kin"" and has replaced all her pronouns with ""meow"" and ""mew"". I just cant handle that shit, makes me feel old and tired to have to deal with it. "
"I have a slightly different perspective, but I think similar. 

I went from a ""grew up in the trailer park"" kid to being a tech nerd. Took a ton of hard work, college, endless studying, etc. Nothing I wasn't willing to do, but certainly something others weren't as willing to do. Several of my ""computer friends,"" for example, still work in low-skill jobs 20 years later. But I liked programming, so I just dove into that. 

10 years out of high school, I'm making 120k+/yr, they're all around 25-40k. Boy, does that change the dynamic of all your relationships. Suddenly you're the ""rich friend"" who should ""pick up the tab for everyone"" when we hang out -- all the time. Never mind that I was saving to buy a house, helping financially support my parents, and paying off college loans. 

I did it a couple times for fun (fun to feel like a baller sometimes), but it soon became clear that it was *expected* of me. That if I was out with them, I would be picking up the tab. I tried a hangout one more time after this moment of clarity, and noticed everybody was getting the expensive shit (as expensive as this place got, anyway) -- steaks, cocktails, seafood. Check comes, everybody awkwardly looks in my direction. Uh oh, I forgot my wallet! So I say, ""Sorry, guys. I picked up the last few, can you guys cover me?"" Cue panic, mutterings of ""Well I wouldn't have ordered this if I knew..."" etc. 

After a couple minutes of this, I pull out a stack of cash, give some to the server for my meal and a generous tip, and walk out. Haven't spoken to most of them since. 

I have a few friends who stuck around, and I've made new friends of course. But it does kind of sting that you can grow up with some people who are ok to just forget you exist if you're not doing something for them. 

Basically anything where people might perceive you as better than them (or more meta, they think you might perceive yourself as better than themselves), it opens the door for strife, animosity, jealousy, etc. Your real friends will ride it out or be happy for you. Your friends of convenience will conveniently disappear. Your leech friends will try to get a piece of your pie, or try to tear you down some other way. It's shitty, but it's the way people work in this society I guess. "

I'm a licensed pilot and girls ask for rides all the time, guys don't.

They seem to think I'd be willing to pay for this just to spend time with them. Some are even in a relationship.

A lot of them ask for favors, all the time, such as rides/whatever. The first time I accept usually, after that nah. Guys only ask me when they've exhausted all options that don't involve others picking up your shit.

Sexism against men and male gender issues exist but it is mostly perpetuated by men towards other men.
"-Men do *not* age better than women. 

They're just held up to less of a judgement about their looks in general, so the bar is lower.

Men 'prove their worth' far less in the looks department, than women in society. 

And men can reproduce basically they're whole lives but women can't, so it makes sense that subconsciously we'll be much more forgiving to a man's appearance as he ages than a woman's.


-Men have no idea how highly sexualized women are. Even just walking down the street sometimes.
My father almost smacked a stranger when I was 14 because a much older guy apparently checked out my ass and turned around to check it out again. 

I have always looked young for my age. 

Their is almost a sense of natural cultural entitlement when it comes to sexualizing women and it shows up in all sorts of ways and it can be deeply, deeply uncomfortable and most guys tend to overlook this or write it off as a girl 'complaining over nothing' or 'secretly liking the attention'.

-90% of men don't handle intense emotions well and don't seem to be aware of this.

-Most men could stand to put more effort into their appearance. "

"Example:

 In 9th grade we were in football practice and I hurt my back (pulled a muscle or something) and we always worked out after practice. 

My coach assigned groups to work out with and I got stuck with the over achievers. 
You know the guys that max bench and have to have help every rep. Arch their back so much and produce such bad form because they are trying to do excessive weight. 

Anyway we finally rotate to squats and In my head I'm like ""I'm not doing this shit today my back hurts enough as it is.""

So I got this bright idea:  I have diarrhea. 

Told my coach and he said ""no you don't"" 
I said ""yeah I do"" and he preceded to follow me to the bathroom. 

Now I went to a 1a school and the bathrooms were so old that there were no stalls. It was two toilets next to each other wide out in the ope across from the showers. So I sit down and he's like ""well?"" So I say ""dude I can't poop with you in here"" and he walks away. 
This dude turns to me and says ""don't flush I'll come look when you're done..................""

So I push and push and push and I finally squeeze this medium sized hard fucking turd. Now I'm standing there thinking ""he's gonna come in here and after he sees this hard turd he's gonna make me fucking run and then do squats."" 

So the only thing I could think of was reach into the toilet and mash that fucking turd up with my hands like its fucking mashed potatoes. 

After I finish mashing it up I start to wash my hands. And right when I get all the soap off coach dickhead walks in and inspects it. He deemed it worthy of not having to do squats and I went home early. 
Pretty fucking low but hey... It worked right?"
"The idea that sleeping around doesn't negatively affect your views on sex, monogamy, ability to commit, and other risk-taking behaviors. No, I don't think promiscuous people are worth less as humans, but I think that sleeping around a ton has negative outcomes for dating, marriage, sex - and it most certainly doesn't exist in a vacuum that is 'all in the past' and no longer impacts people.

"Shortly after my girlfriend and I started dating, but before each of us deleted our Tinder accounts (we didn't meet through the app or online in general), she showed me hers and I was blown away by the fact that she literally had hundreds of matches, easily at least 10 times as many as I did. Granted, she is exceptionally beautiful so it was expected, but it turns out this is common for female Tinder users in general, as she said that many girls she knew also had an overwhelming number of matches.

On the flip side though, she also got lots of inappropriate messages, so she rarely felt like messaging back to guys (even for those who were not creepy), which finally provided an anecdotal explanation for my frequent disappointments at not getting a reply to my messages. In fact, she even said that she wished she got fewer matches and that she had swiped left far more often so that she could reduce this problem."

&gt;dating?

There are women who aren't willing to deal with this especially if the mother is problematic. There are also women who will like this. No idea why. Bonus kid? Anyway don't parade women in front of your kid if you can help it. You don't want them forming attachments to people who wander through your life. 

&gt;Finances?

This is going to be expensive and it will hinder your movement limiting opportunity. There is not sugar coating. Good luck with child support. Some fucked up regions will backdate it and you will owe that woman a year of backdated child support. 

*In your case, kids need a father. If you are that kid's father, be that kids father and don't let the fact that the kid was secreted from you for a year interfere with that. If the woman beats you down with the legal system remember that the kid didn't do that.*

Good luck.

"Overall they're much more empathetic than guys.  Women are so nice to be around when you're feeling down, and usually have more insightful things to say that lift you up.

Being with a transgender man. I don't judge them and I'm glad we live in a world where transgender people can be who they want to be. But I just don't think I could ever be with a trans man. Even post-op. Everyone always makes me feel terrible about this :/ 
"No, you're a hateful person and the reason why you keep getting told to treat women better is because you're an absolute cunt to them, judging by your post history. You're bitter about the fact that women... exist? And you treat people with hostility here because of it.

"I think that the phenomenon that it was created to describe -- men trying to explain something to a woman unnecessarily because he assumes she doesn't understand it because she's a woman, or attempts to explain sexism or other things experienced by women -- definitely happens. I very rarely hear the term actually used, but when i have, it has applied to the situation pretty well."
"I like my beard. Not necessarily for 'manly' purposes. I keep it trimmed (not a fan of the big bush), keep the edges straight like I do my hair and for me personally, it thins my face a little because I've got quite a round face.

"I remember this chick dating coach saying that women go for status/income because if you're making money then chances are you work a good job, and you're probably pretty high up on the ladder at work. If you're at that level then chances are you aren't stupid and more importantly you're probably fairly confident. Women love confidence and reason that anybody high in the hierarchy of a company are confident individuals. 

It sounds like a pretty good reason on the surface anyway. "

"About 3 years ago I was arrested for a series of break-ins and thefts at businesses in 3 counties, including my employer. I *did not* do it, but when a detective says you did, your boss, a judge, even close friends (all people who should know better) think you did. It's a horrific feeling; sitting in jail with an astronomical bond, no clue how long you'll be stuck there with no sun, no friends or family, no happiness, wondering if anyone in the world believes you or cares what you're going through.

She did. She answered every phone call no matter what time it was, wrote back every single email. She put money in my commisarry every week so I could eat decently and have soap and a toothbrush. She visited no matter what, even though it was clearly hard for her. I was only locked up for 15 days, this wasn't some long stretch just to be clear. Trust me when I say, though, 2 weeks is a long time to be so unsure about being a free person.

As much as she supported me, I was too distracted with the problems of being in jail to truely feel how deep her care went. When I finally got home I was sitting on the couch, and I saw a notebook in between the cushions. I took it out and saw page after page after page after page of lawyers phone numbers, the names of everyone involved in my case, my family's contact info, the name of anyone who would answer the phone at the police station and the jail, lists of what they were feeding me, legal information on people falsely accused or maliciously prosecuted, doodles where she kept composure while on hold, blue margins smudged where a tear fell.

I don't think I'll ever feel more cared for than when I saw that notebook."

Third, that we actively come up with means for women to meet the standards, whether that means better technology or extra training."

"If you ever get into a fight, lean into the punch. 

If you ever get into a fight, hit the other person in the nose as hard as you can. Even if you don't break it, you can get it bleeding pretty good. Unless they've been in a bunch of fights before, which most guys haven't, it'll disorient them for a split second and they'll bleed. When they drop their guard for the split second, keep hitting. On a side note, if you ever see a woman who's pissed off putting vasoline on her face and taking out her ear rings, she's getting ready to fight and she's probably done it before. They do it because women tend to try to scratch the other woman's face when fighting, and coating your face in vasoline makes it just a little more slippery and more difficult.

You should have some form of ""oh shit"" bag in your car. It should involve tools to preform basic roadside maintenance like changing or plugging a tire, water and a pair of channel locks in case the car overheats, some water to drink, snacks that won't go bad for a while (beef jerky, MRE's), a full change of clothes for the coldest and hottest months where you live. If you may be stranded somewhere in the snowy months, carry a shovel in your car, have things that will keep you warm, fire building materials (a 9 volt battery touched to steel wool works, as do cotton balls soaked in vasoline with a bic lighter).

Find your ""tribe"" as early as you can in life. Find a group of men who can mentor you, teach you, guide you, and offer you the opportunity to learn new skills and ideas. Look for other, usually younger, men to help mentor and guide. The earlier you learn how to lead and teach with patience and confidence and how to follow with an open mind and enthusiasm, the better person you will be. At different times in your life you will be looked on to be a leader and a follower, and knowing how to do so effectively can make bad situations run much more smoothly.

Unless people start using a similar term for when women talk down to a man, I agree that the words we have in place already (patronizing, condescending, asshole, etc) are sufficient. I'm also curious how thinking only one sex is capable of being condescending to the other sex isn't sexist?

"I think it was intended to describe some actual instances of sexism.  For example, a heterosexual couple is looking at buying a car, the woman is much more knowledgeable about cars than the man is, but the salesperson speaks in more technical terms with the man and dumbs it down for the woman, and maybe tries to sell her the car based on the fact that the color matches her shirt or something.

Like, they have the husband, the babies, the nice house, the nice clothes. In a lot of those situations, she doesn't really have to work anymore (I know that's an unpopular opinion and seems sexist, but I see it all the time) because her husband makes the money. So, he works and she works out. She goes to the park and jogs with the stroller with the other moms, and they have to stay fit so that the women around them don't talk shit. She could probably gain ten pounds and her husband won't notice/won't care, but the jogging group definitely will. 


I'm not saying this gives men free reign to get fat and lazy. But it is true that a lot of men get married and stop putting in so much work on their appearance, and convert it to some other activity that tried to provide security for the family. "

There *has* to be some deep psychological or emotional toll for living a life that secluded, right?  99/100 issues I can grin and bear and push through with little outside help.  I consider this strength and maturity, but it's that last one that gets me.  You know, the one that follows 99 that may not even be that big unto itself that smashes me into the floor.    

I know women can have the same issue, but I think it is more prominent for guys and less discussed.  I know that with even my best friends, we rarely talk serious shit about our own emotional states.  I'm talking once every 5 years tops.  I think women do enjoy a bit better venting more regularly.  Anyway, can't really do much to change it so like the guy I am, I'll grin and bear it as usual."
"I think guys would experiment like women do if there wasn't a stigma against it and so much macho/homophobia stuff. For example go into a locker room for a sports team and this is supposed to be full of hetero alpha males and it is the most homoerotic place you will ever see, towel flipping, ass slaps,etc"
"Most guys, especially those on the internet, overestimate their intellectual prowess, can't empathize with anyone who is different from themselves, don't understand nuance, and are frankly rude shits.  They assume their perspective is always correct, but typically operate on flawed and biased information (aka rationalizing their beliefs).  

They are immature, prideful, self-centered fools, which makes them fools.  In other words, they all think they're Rick, but they're really Jerry.  At least Morty has compassion."

Holy shit this is how it feels to be objectified
"Pro tip: not every woman wants to grind with you. I love dancing, but I *loathe* grinding with guys. I have my own rhythm and idea of how I want to move. No one else can read my mind and so they just end up hindering my dance moves and motonously moving your hips back and forth is so fecking boring anyway. 

But if you want to try:

* Be on the dance floor

* Bob your head or whatever, move through the crowd until you find a woman you like

* Dance on your own near her. Try to make eye contact. Smile. Does she smile back? Does she maintain eye contact? Continue to dance near her, perhaps facing her. Be a little goofy if you want. Does she turn away from you? If she turns away, assume it's because she's trying to avoid you, not because she wants you to immeditely grind with her.

* Lean in, say ""Hey, I'm *name*!"" Smile. Does she tell you her name? Give a compliment or a conversation starter (not that you can have much conversation in a club.) Something like ""I like the way you dance"" or ""I love this song.""  It doesn't matter, you're just gauging if she's actually interested in having you near her. Again: does she smile? Does she turn away? 

* If all signs point to her *not* trying to avoid you: Move closer. Hell, ask her if she wants to dance. Guys seem to offer advice all the time that you should just go for it and *be an alpha* and just start dancing with her. Let me tell you that personally I really enjoy when a guy asks me to dance instead of just grabbing me.

* If she wants to dance: Dance near her, facing her, at first. Does she move away? No? Then get a little closer. Reach for her hand, or lightly put your hand on her waist. Does she move away? No? Keep dancing

* NOW TIME TO PULL OUT THE BIG GUNS, OP: Grab her hand, and spin her (you know, the way people do in swing dancing.) This is fun, ladies like the spin move. Then bring her back into you with her back to your face. Place your hand on her waist. Does she move away? No? You're grinding, son.

DO NOT:

* Approach her from behind and start rubbing your half hard dick on her thigh before she so much as even sees your face. Fuck off with that shit, guys"
"Another thing I cannot un-see is the fact that literally every poly-person I know (I live and went to grad school in Portland, we're not talkin' one or 2 people, here) are unstable in some way or other. Either promiscuous, into drinking heavily/ drugs, unable to commit, fickle relationships that end dramatically, in and out of school for years. I think that there's gotta be something about the type of person that's 'polyamorous' that makes them more predisposed to risk-taking behavior"
"A friend of mine once said I don't fuck unless I'm fucking the heart. 

Sex is about intimate emotional connection for me. If I don't have that connection with a girl, sex is just fulfilling a hormonal urge. Obviously I feel that urge like everyone else, but sex means so much more if you actually care about the other person."
"Short shorts, assuming that she has thick thighs. If the thighs ain't thick, short shorts aren't anything special. "
"That sex has a very specific smell. 

Walk in a room after someone had sex in it and no amount of fabreeze will cover it up."
"I surely hope so. 
I find myself getting increasingly nice to them to the point of feeling contrived because I am so cautious of 'triggering' their insecurity, assuming that's what it is. "
"People reminding me to do something that I'm already doing.  

Paying for parking.  

When my headphone wire gets caught on something and they get yanked out of my ears.  

Any presenter who asks the crowd how they're feeling, and then follow it up with ""I CAN'T HEAR YOU! I SAID HOW ARE YOU FEELING!?""  

When someone leaves time on the microwave.  "
"Ruined her own engagement surprise because she was sneaking into my Facebook. 

I figure that was a good enough lesson in itself. "
"You get over it in about a week. Drink plenty of water, especially after a meal, sleep right and just wait it out. It's tough. It can last for a couple if days to a week or so. You'll be fine."
Intelligence. I love it when I can have an intellectual conversation with a girl. 
"Someone get his dad card, that's a fucking disgrace.

I got so many dirty looks from moms doing the same thing. It's glorious.
"&gt;I then got bitched out for a solid 2 minutes for 'mansplaining'.

You should have apologized and said you were only ""mansplaining"" because she was ""cuntfused""

"We take a big family hunting trip to the cabin every year, whitetail hunting in tree stands. There's about 2 dozen people out there most them kids, ranging from 10-26 (I'm the oldest). Anyhow, my girlfriend was the first and only woman to have ever cleaned their deer themselves. She refused any help aside from instruction or general guidance.. This hunting tradition has been going on for 10+ years, there have been easily 50 people take their first deer at the farm, and there are probably more girls than boys. 

She is the one and only woman to step in an handle it on her own. I tell those girls, ""You killed it but you won't clean it?"" and they shake their head and says it's too gross. So, the most unpopular gendered opinion I hold is this: You ladies that have the heart to pull the trigger, but not the stomach to do the work need to just stay home and let the people who will get their hands dirty do the hunting.

"Especially compared to what an average woman will do for a date. It's not hard to get a hair cut, some nice fitting clothes, and get cleaned up a little bit and women will appreciate it a lot more. "
"Seriously negative.

Saw two of them after a series of ""horrible"" relationships. Infidelity, manipulation, straight up abuse, you name it. And every time something terrible was done to me, I got to hear the same thing from friends and family: ""what did you do to deserve it?""

Enter therapist number 1 who explained to me that was correct, that when things go bad, it's a mans fault always. Conversation went like this:

Her: you have to understand that a relationship is about a man making a woman happy. If he doesn't, that's where issues come from, and the relationship fails

Me: and where is a mans happiness supposed to come from?

Her: the satisfaction of a job well done

Ditched that bitch, saw a second one, who confirmed the first one was right.

Wow. INSTANT downvotes for calling male servitude to females horseshit. Never change you pathetic white knights"
"There's this class of women that absolutely do not take shit from anyone or anything.  This is very different from not taking good advice; rather, they plow through certain problems, have a very good sense, and are very fair in their actions even in the face of things not being fair towards them.  

They don't focus on how they're women; they focus on being tough as fucking nails to get things done.  Just absolutely determined individuals, some of the best people to ever meet period.

They're to absolutely be admired."

"If imagine you teach them how to be good people and treat everyone with respect, in the same manner in which you'd teach your daughters to respect themselves and other people. 

It's a legit question, but the way it's phrased irks me - as if all boys have this defect that needs to be drummed out of them. Both genders need to be taught how to respect each other. "
"For most people the contrast isn't as evident between the two modes and ""don't talk to me signals"" signals have the same pitfalls as other signals, or at least there's a perception as such."

"The fact that they even notice is like an art sometimes.  

In a year where I lost friends to tragedy and was losing family, it was always my friends' girlfriends, girls at work, or my one female friend who said they noticed what I was thinking about and asked me how I was doing.

Girls are beautiful and it has nothing to do with looks."

"Because I said I couldn't hit her.

It was in college.  We were having a floor meeting and someone brought up asking who would be up for a game of tackle football in the snow tomorrow.  A bunch of guys were into it.  Then one girl said ""Why can't I play""  I said ""nobody said you couldn't play.  You didn't say you were interested.  Are you interested?  We can go touch""  ""Why not tackle?""  ""I can't hit you""  so she walked over, punched me in the stomach and said ""How about now?  Can you hit me now?""  ""No.  I'm not hitting you""  ""Sexist pig"""

"There is some data from OkCupid that gets circulated every once in a while.  It basically shows, if you make no other assumptions, that women find very few men attractive, while men find many women attractive.  That men only get marked ""attractive"" if they're in the top 20% or so.  A lot of people have a lot to say about what that means about *women* but it often crosses my mind that it might just be the truth.  "
"If you want to get A's in school, you have to stop studying, eventually you'll have a 4.0.

"It's never gone away in my experience.   I just live with the assumption that sooner or later everything is going to go to shit in the worst way.

So far that's proven true.  Luckily I've slid into the ""fuck it"" area, so I don't stress about it anymore, just know it's going to happen eventually."

"My all time favorite actual mansplaining was in high school. A couple girls and I were talking about what tampon brands we liked, and their differences. A boy walked into the conversation, literally interrupted someone talking, and began explaining to us that we were using tampons incorrectly, and then lectured us on toxic shock syndrome. I'm not sure the term 'mansplaining' was around back then, and I've not personally encountered something so perfect since.

The least legit use I've heard was eavesdropping at the mall, one young woman explaining to another how her first day of training went. It didn't sound like she had a ton of previous experience, so I'm pretty sure the male supervisor doing the training was not at all mansplaining."

"Use your feet to walk over to him, with your mouth say something like ""I think you're cute, you should come drink with me"", if he says yes, then drink with him. If he says no, go back to your table.

"This is what I always think whenever some dude talks about how much he loves cargo shorts or only dresses for comfort. Like, ok, it's your choice, but don't bitch and complain when women prefer guys who are a little more put together. It's usually the first piece of advice that most women will give to increase your attractiveness, but if you want to ignore it, feel free. "
"I think men enjoy a slow courtship more than they say (or think) that they do. 

On a related note, when women ask for relationship advice, I hear many men advise them to be very forward sexually. This is bad advice if you are after a traditional bf/gf relationship. It's fine advice if you want a ONS, fuckbuddy, or FWB.  "
"This is the correct answer.
