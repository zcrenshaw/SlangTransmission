"They def are.  

Def.  like as in...

"Pull out her tampon with your teeth to show her how eager you are.    

Give her a random cum shower before she leaves for work. This will make her feel sexy and you will def get it when she comes home.  
  
Have her catch you with another woman. This cause her to be more competitive in the bedroom. She will then try harder to keep you hers alone. Also bonus 3 way.   

Make sure you finish quick and fast before her. This will show her how hot you think she is. Fall asleep immediately to show your satisfaction.     "
"More like never meet your villains.

I went to a comic con and both Thor and Loki was there. I got a photo op with each individually and one together. When it came to Chris Hemsworth, you could tell he was tired possibly from jetlag but he was trying, interacting with everyone, giving hugs and doing fun poses. 

Then came the group photo with both and as we went to enter the booth, we all personally got warned - no touching, no hugging, no kissing, no handshakes. I was confused as to why handshakes are not allowed. I thought maybe because the line was so long they wanted to rush through it.

Then came the solo photo with Tom Hiddleston and got given the same warning. His line wasnt busy because they capped the ticket limit, so it was annoying to have spent $400 to meet someone for 12 seconds and not even being allowed to give a handshake or say hi. Chris Hemsworth was only $80 and he was def value for money. 

On a side note, the best person at that comic con was John Cena. He took at least 2 hours to meet and his line wasnt long because of the ticket limit but he was spending a good 5 mins with everyone. When I admitted i only knew him as a celebrity and not properly as a wrestler, he thanked me for my support and he didnt care about talking about himself, he actually wanted to have a conversation."
