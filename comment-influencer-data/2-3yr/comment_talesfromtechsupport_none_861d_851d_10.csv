"50,000 files used to be stored here....now, it's a pagefile.



EDIT:  The post itself isn't gilded but I was given gold with the note:

&gt; Loved your MW comment. Made me think about the good ole days of 2007

This may or may not have been a result of /u/lsl1337 asking why it wasn't.  Thank you to the redditor who gilded me!"
I think the real story here is just how did she discover sucking her thumb would allow her to log in. 
Load balancer. That *is* funny 
"Later when their manager tries to talk to them:

Im sorry I am waiting to speak to my manager, youll have to come back later."
"1) Have you tried restarting the device?

2) Is everything on/plugged in that needs to be?

3) Have you tried doing it while sucking your thumb?

Standard troubleshooting procedure right here."
"""Ok, press this button.""

""Close, let's try this again...""   "
So she doesn't understand cause and effect? That hurt just to read.
"&gt; he was a happy **camper**

Sounds like a Modern Warfare player alright"
"""I was just. Testing you. Uhm. You passed."""
"Did you write this while you were still hungover and sleep y? It reads like it, and is much better for it. "
"Reminds me of the Douglas Adams line from ""Life the Universe and Everything"":

&gt; I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble. It's uphill work. The only word they know is ""unh"", and they don't know how to spell it. "
"I would suggest you reevaluate your choice of friend... The machine god demands his sacrifice!

"&gt;Oh, and reader, I got the ticket.

I love happy endings. "
"&gt; Your credentials are sent to your personal email when you get hired.

Shouldn't that include instructions to change your password to something *not* emailed out in plain text?


Also, you could have suggested ""auto-resetting"" the password by clicking on the ""forgot password"" link and following the instructions."

Users is why would you "

One of my workers had a similar story where he had to explain what a grammatical period was to a college student. He was extremely close to screaming at the kid and hanging up. He also had to show a faculty member how to swap the plug on macbook charger. She interrupted 4 times while he was explaining it to tell him that he needs to explain it. 
"""Yeah sure, so what you want to do is -- do you have a toaster and a bathtub?"""
Get one of those rubber keyboards so she can't hear you googling everything she says through the phone
"Few days later

Heihei: hey, my email isn't working, can you help"
"&gt;And can you do me a favor?

&gt;Yes.

&gt;Have a nice day. *click*

That was perfect. Best veiled insult I've seen in a while."
She's officially [dumber than a cat.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1001-6)
"Bug Report 1:  Team Leader doesn't understand how keyboards work.  Suggest remedial PC training with IT.  Also, require minimum 100 hours of work to certify her in keyboarding for googlebing. "
"Too funny... almost like the whole thing was just to set up for it...

Why would you run an ethernet cable through a closet at the proper height to hang coats on it? Why wouldn't it be affixed to the wall or run down the corner to the floor then across the floor?"
But was it CoAT5 cable??
"Ahh yes, the old ""I'm gonna laugh so it doesn't look like I'm still pissed off about my folder fucking up the equipment. It's still his fault though."" routine."

""No that's not it either"""
"I can almost understand his actions if the person was a junior manager or some other low level staff member. But with the the title of Financial Controller you would think this person would have a greater capability of financial acumen.  

I mean if I found a leaky faucet in my house, my first act to stop the drip would not be to take an axe to the mains leading into my house. "
"Haha no, between everyone laughing she just sat there laughing "
"You know you will get to talk to her again, when youre at work and she calls to ask why her email isnt working... ;)"
"I work nights, that was my last call, now I'm getting drunk, listening to electroswing, and dancing"
"&gt;Thankfully the cell phone conversation was not recorded as they do not record from their end. Only ours.

Now *that* is handy info to, ""make use of""."
"I just looked up the PC requirements for MW: 2 GB RAM.

That's quite a bit less than 1 *TB*. 500x less.

I'm.... yeah, that's all."
You're expecting a bit much of an HR system.
"You might want to look into prematurely replacing that cable, such excessive force can cause issues further down the line"
"""grammatical period"" as in... the kind at the end of a sentence...?"
Ticket = me keeping my job. Which is why I ended up not keeping my job. A lesson hard learned
"Yes, yes I was. So I suppose that the Ballmer Peak works for programming and writing tech support stories. We all need to do research on this ASAP. IÂ´ll bring tequila and nachos!

Relevant (as always) XKCD: https://xkcd.com/323/ "
"That guy was really reasonable, good on him. "
"It was more that I didn't want her to heat me asking my coworkers what the fuck the app was. Most of the apps we support (outside of Okta, Citrix, and AD) are programs that only our clients use. There's a good chance you've never heard of this app unless you work for that company. "
Why did you only put the trouble in the tldr? Shouldn't have to read that part. 
That will be a short conversation 
"That's understandable, Windows computers usually just shut themselves off at random intervals."
I'd bet money that was actually what she said
"""Yeah, I'm making you sue me! I'll be paying for all of these damages! That'll teach you to sell slow internet!"""
"""Have a nice day"" = ""go fuck yourself"" in disguise in IT language I believe.

Just imagine someone telling you ""have a nice day"" with a really mocking tone"
"Nope. Told her she now has no way to complete the process. 
Then hung up "
"Yup, this is why. The person in question wanted the computer moved but the cabinet/closet was already in place. It's a floor to ceiling design that's attached to the wall so the option someone decided on was too just go through it instead of whatever would be required to go around it. "
"Unfortunately the *stars* are not in position for this sacrifice!
Stars...
Can't do it...
Not today..."
lol they were probably using their work email for personal accounts
*It's a legitimate strategy!*
"&gt; Im sorry I am waiting to speak to my manager, youll have to come back later.

"Six figure salary IT Guy that is incapable of following simple instructions? Hey company, fire that guy and hire me instead!"
"probably users not putting in tickets, and managers seeing no tickets and thinking theyre wasting their money on the guy who ""does nothing"""
"No, that's what you're supposed to do. If you invade during the summer, by the time you get anywhere, it'll be winter and your supply lines will be built for summer sun not wintery death.

Invade Russia in the goddamn fucking winter. Your supply lines will be snow hardened and by the time you get somewhere interesting it'll be summer, and it'll be lots of nice, breezey, sunny, days for murder.

And then you can resume Hitler's plan for what to do with Moscow. Kill its residents and replace the city with a lake."
"&gt;not in Tech Support but hopefully will be eventually after completing my Comp-Sci degree

I would reevaluate that if I were you. You can probably land a different, better paid job with less user interaction with a completed degree."
I suspect they're doing it on purpose because they don't like having to do something new.  
Twist ending:  he'd rescued the monitor - the computer was a burnt melted unsalvageable mess.
The more important question is what kind of godless heathen presses enter with their left hand?
"&gt;Heihei: Ya, but my phone said it was and asked me if I wanted to block that number, so I said yes. 

Hang up and close the ticket as ""*Customer declined further assistance*."""
"Oh man, I had something pretty much just like this once when I worked helpdesk for a Managed Services Provider.

CEO of one of the clients had scheduled a time for us to call in and help him with a set of issues and he had blocked this off on his schedule so he wouldn't be disturbed while we worked through them.

Basically I called, receptionist is like ""Sorry he has a meeting scheduled right now and doesn't want to be disturbed.""

I argue with this lady for almost 10 minutes (some of that was her putting me on hold) that I am the person he is expecting for his meeting and I'm with &lt;company name&gt; helpdesk. She belligerently keeps saying he asked to ""not be disturbed under any circumstance""

At about that point I hear a door open in the background and him going ""Has &lt;company name&gt; called in yet, I've been expected them since 1 o'clock""

Lady is like ""I have someone from &lt;company name&gt; on the line right now demanding to talk to you that refuses to hang up despite me letting them know you're in a meeting."" to which he responds ""Yes, because that is who my meeting is with, transfer them to my phone immediately..."""
Does it have to be a thumb?
"Why would he... aaagh...

even I, a total idiot with no training, would know better than this. Never detangle a cable you don't retain where it connects unless you're willing to deal with everything breaking."
"What do those two users do for a living man?!  
Seriously no one can be that dumb...
  
I can't imagine if it was me on your shoes i do boil pretty quickly in this situations."
"""Werent paying attention"". 

Wow am getting angry just reading this. Go to their desk and strangle them with the phone cord, I will be your alibi. "
"Oh. Then you're screwed, good luck *runs*"
"Wait, so if we have a huge page file, Can we just delete it? "
"In this particular case, I don't think it's the ISP's fault (since he lived in a remote rural part and was lucky to get any internet at all), but...

&gt;We get customers who call ALL the time to complain about how slow their DSL internet is. We remote in and see that there's 15 iPhones, 5 PlayStations, 6 Xboxes, 2 smart TVs and a whole bunch of other stuff. You only have 7 megs, no wonder it's so slow.

This is a symptom of ISPs not keeping up with the pace of technology and shifts in society (more people staying at home longer, larger families in housing) along with cable companies resting on their non-competitive laurels and either refusing to service areas or pricing them at unreasonable rates.

As we push towards the future, more and more Internet of Things devices and services are going to want to use your internet connection for larger and larger data transfers, while the number of people working from home will increase. DSL at this point is as legacy an internet connection as 56k dial-up and cellular Edge. cable is the new DSL and gigabit fiber is the new cable."
You'd be surprised at how many things prove radically different than they seem once they've been properly studied. 
Did you escalate her ticket to someone who was equipped (physically or emotionally) to go through unblocking your company?
That's definitely on my list. Just waiting to make a long enough cable and then I'll be swapping it out before anyone arrives. 
"You may be joking, but I once dealt with a Software Engineer from Russia or Romania (somewhere in Eastern Europe) who had a Ph.D. in Computer Science but couldn't figure out now to shutdown a Windows computer. That she worked night and day on, for at least 2 years by that point."
"&gt; I will hold you personally responsible

Ah, the battle cry of the idiot. I have been doing this for more than ten years and I haven't met a functional human being yet that talks like this. It's people like this that make me **WANT** a welfare state. If I could pay a little extra in taxes to never have to deal with one of these degenerates again I would be able to quit every vice I have."
"In general terms, a page file is space on the hard drive that is treated as RAM. It is much slower than actual RAM, and is usually only used when the machine is using all the RAM it has and needs more.

EDIT: Additional info: OP's friend had turned off ""automatic"" mode, which the vast majority of PCs use, and instead entered a size manually. A HUGE size that ate most of his hard drive space.

EDIT2: As /u/ElusiveGuy points out, there is more to it than this, but again, this is a _general_ explanation of what a page file is."
yes
"""I took the smart way out""

No, you took the moron way out, oh and you just made a legal statement, recorded on the CC system, that it was stolen, so hey double dumbfuck is a you."
"I bet he has a dual core processor, multiple 1080p monitors, a TB hard drive, no SSD, and a budget graphics card that he overpaid for.

The people who brag about their PCs unintelligibly tend to have really bad ones."
"I've dealt with sucky users before, but this is ridiculous!"
"Just give her a reason why you'll need to call her back in a min, then update the ticket when the call is blocked.

Problem solved."
"Backups that either come to naught or half a page of garbled lines  
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.  
The panic's gone, the file is back.   
How else can I assist you today?"
"Probably spelled 'library' with four 'r's again, the poor bastard."
"I have a lot of experience with the whole computer thing you know, emails, sending emails, receiving emails, deleting emails, I could go on... The web. Using a mouse, mices, using mice. Clicking, double clicking. The computer screen, of course. The keyboard. The... bit that goes on the floor down there. "
