"&gt; I don't understand why he thinks the way he does

As general life advice, don't waste your time trying to understand why assholes are being assholes. He doesn't have a reason for his belief - it's not even certain that he truly, deep down, in his heart or his head, actually believes what he says: he just says that to get to you. Acting superior to others makes him feel better, and he cares about that more than he cares about good manners (it would be rude to tell you that your career choice is stupid, even if your career choice were to be a poet), being reasonable (calling a career stupid says everything about your brother and his value system and approximately nothing about the career, not least because ""stupid"" has no intrinsic meaning in this context), or not alienating everyone around him, including his close family members. 

It's a shame your brother is like this, but you can't reason him out of something he didn't reason himself into, so don't waste your time."
"Not a server, but I've found this to be true in most areas of life. Charismatic, easy-to-talk-to people are often humongous assholes in disguise. Why? Because they *can* be."
"&gt; She started another relationship while you guys were still married.

And still living together.

And he was tolerating this so that she could still use his insurance.

OP showed he would take a proverbial bullet for her.

Her response was to text another man while OP was around and let it show on her face. From OP "" I would see her smiling at texts she got from him""

Wow, just wow.

"What color is Chloe's hair? If it's the same as yours or your wife's, then never mind. Black, well then ok, maybe she cheated. But I'm betting it's not, or you would have mentioned that, too.

Others here have told you: epicanthic folds do happen in the genetic populations you're from. I knew a Dutch-German woman with eyes like your daughter's. If the only thing you're seeing that looks 'Asian' is her eyes, then please forget about this before you break up your family over you being undereducated and suspicious."
"They're Finno-Ugric and speak a Uralic language. The Urals are a mountain range mostly in central Asia, which is likely where the epicanthic folds developed (we don't know why, possibly an adaptation to harsh winds/snow). So, the other poster is wrong, there is a connection to 'Asian' genetics in the Sami."
"When you're on the first date and the ""so what do you do for a living"" question comes up, you say ""I work in the sex industry"". 

Expect to have lots of guys not want to date anymore, or suddenly get upset if you don't have sex with them right away (I mean I'm sure you standards for dates when you get sexual).

However, don't wait any longer than a few dates."
"Are you seriously suggesting that OP was in the wrong for stating his dealbreakers? What terrible, terrible advice, OP ignore this person."
"If you read carefully, you would see that she was not happy with her nose because of the way it looked. Not just because of the malformations. Yes, the malformations is what caused it. But aesthetically, it was not pretty to her."
He is a really awesome friend in my opinion.
Nadie escarmienta en cabeza ajena.
"&gt;He has started to say passive aggressive things about our relationship to me

Like what, if you don't mind?

&gt;She has been far less than open and honest about the past dynamic between these two people. 

Relationships should be based on honesty and openness. How is she not doing this? I mean, you seem to know quite a bit, really. She told you about their past. That seems pretty open and and honest. 

&gt; My thought is, being friends with them is cool, go do stuff, but if we can't be open and honest about it, how can you properly create healthy boundaries with these people, when the reality is, she is putting boundaries on us about it, rather than the other way.

That sounds 100% rational to me. You aren't asking her to never speak to them again. You are asking her to be honest and open with  you. However, what would your idea of the correct boundaries be?

"
"If you don't trust her, you shouldn't be with her in the first place."
"Then I think you have your answer. If he wanted to marry you, he'd have done something about it by now. "
Yeah :(

"Totally! No wonder the sister is pissed off, that girl is being completely creepy. And the comments here are talking about her wanting him as if it a good thing. What the fuck."
"Honestly I don't think the drugs are impacting the relationship here, it's his insistence that he controls what she does with her live. They were both casually doing drugs and everything was fine. 

An addiction is when it affects all of your relationships: work, love, friends, family. Just because one relationship is going badly doesn't mean it's instantly because of the drugs and therefore an addiction. 

You stopped reading halfway through but if you kept going you would see her insisting that she just wants to live her life and feeling patronized and insulted and you'd see that he can't seem to understand that he can't control someone. "
"This is weird and actually really mean. Who says that to his or her SO? How'd she feel if you said ""You have a wide vagina!"" It's mean and solely meant to put you down; normal secure people don't want to put people they love down. You're not overreacting, it's a bad bad sign. "
Your options are ignore it or tell her the bad news. Option 1 kicks the can down the road *and* doesn't make your wife happy. Is your wife's happiness or your former friend's unhappiness more important to you? Make your decision.
"I'd rather lose a friend after a bad breakup of the relationship, than to expect my friend to not date a person they want because of how it would change my life..."
"No OP.... sometimes, a mistake is a mistake. And for most people sleeping with someone is well... more than just a 'whoops, I slipped'. It's a big thing, a real deal breaker (for most)

He cheated 3 times OP.... that's someone who didn't feel too guilty about it.



"
Well my friend was the one with me at the restaurant and on the way home she swears that she didn't tell him we were going out that night. I trust her and to be fair I hadn't talk to her since I went home so she had no way to know I didn't want anything to do with him when she consented to let him pick me up from the airport. 
"&gt;  if you love someone don't you stick with them through everything

You don't stick through them saying they want to fuck other people, wtf?

Unless you want to fuck up even more, move on. You have a restraining order against you!"
"&gt; we do care , it's just we want the group to be couples right now.

For what purpose?  I don't think I'm alone in being confused about what it is you actually want, and more importantly, why you want it.

"So your family can be as rude as they want to you, but the moment you speak up about something that is honestly bothering you, that is ""ruining the chances at a good relationship with your family""?

I know exactly what you are going through. My mother is the black sheep of her family. Her parents and siblings aren't outright mean to her, but they can be very thoughtless at times. This behavior extends to me and my sister as well. For years I tried to be the perfect relative, to bend over backwards in hopes that they would accept me and treat me like all of my cousins. But I was raised differently from them (they all grew up together in the same town, I grew up in a city about 2 hours away), and I was taught to act differently than they were. So any time I acted differently than what they were expecting me to, they responded with shock and anger. Even though some of their behaviors were exceptionally rude to me, I was the rude one. Every. Single. Time.

My life got a lot better when I stopped trying so hard. I still love them, but now I treat them like any other 'weekday friend', and things are better because of it."
"This is disgusting, for her to be so disrepectful and rude about someone she supposedly cares about. 
If i saw my boyfriend saying things like that about me i would be out of the relationship in no time.

What do you need help with? Surely you wouldn't be able to look at her or be around her the same after she said that. You might want it to work, but why?

Surely you would rather be with someone who doesn't trash talk about you and take the piss out of you. Girls talk and gossip but no way is it okay for her to say this about you. 

She needed to accept how you look and not judge you. She obviously can't do that and wants you to change. Why bother?

You are worth so MUCH more.

"There is a certain point in time when you have to be reasonable/ realistic about your finances. 

Can you imagine being with him 10 years from now, him still trying to make it big in the youtuber streamer market?

Don't send his resume for him. He is an adult, and should be able to do that for himself at 25. 

You need to sit him down and tell him seriously that it's time to get realistic, and look for a job ASAP. He can't do this forever."
"Team Grace. Wtf is wrong with you OP. Do you even parent? Your daughter is apparently the only sane one in this story. 

The open door policy is a horrendous thing to inflict on a teenager. If you're not very careful, your daughter will grow up to hate you and with good reason apparently. "
"You've done this before, you can do it again. Go home. Have a good cry. Tell your wife. Have a bottle of wine. Take the evening. Get out of the house tomorrow. Go for a hike or long drive with your wife.  Wake up on Sunday and dust off your resume. Get your ducks in a row. On Monday, the hunt begins."
"Well yeah obviously... If he fathered a kid at 11!

Jesus wept. "
"Bro, don't waste your time. These two obviously have some very twisted views on things. "
"I disagree strongly.

&gt; So whether she's on a topless beach where hundred of people see her topless or just a few friends after a drunken night, she hasn't done anything offensive.

It's not offensive- it's hurtful to her partner.  That's the issue here.

Saying ""It's not illegal, and it's her body, therefore what she did is okay"" applies just the same if she had sex with 100 other men at the bachelorette party.  Just because you or she is okay with showing her breasts to strangers doesn't mean OP is okay with it, and when she married him it comes with an understanding that you do your best not to do what makes the other person unhappy.

She doesn't have to feel shamed for showing nudity- again, that's not the issue.

It's that in the relationship she shares with her husband, sharing topless photos with other people wasn't on the table, and she broke that.  OP is rightly upset that the trust he placed in their agreement to keep their nudity to themselves was broken.  

While it's totally fine if she decides she can be topless anytime she wants, it's not fine to expect OP to go along with that without having a conversation about it first."
"You should make the next time you see him occur soon. 

You keep phrasing things so passively—""the next time I see him."" Like, at the grocery store? You make the appointment, dude. 

That much sleep is very unusual and you should definitely get checked out posthaste if it's affecting your marriage. "
"&gt; he just wants sex.

It sounds like what he really wants is a fleshlight that moves on its own. "
"THIS!!! just the other day, there was a guy who had a revenge porn incident after a messy breakup. Don't let this happen to you!!!"
I know she will be resentful/angry even if she believes me fully. I'm dreading that and just wishing I could turn back the clocks on my life.
"Neither my sister nor I were bad children growing up. We were awful to each other for awhile, and I was a bad person for pulling those stunts on her boyfriends. My sister and I were also both the type of college kid to drink a lot, party and occasionally miss classes. I guess that can also be characterized as bad, but by no means did Grandma know about any of the things. As far as she knew, my sister was her first born grandchild and I was her youngest girl grandchild, and we were her dolls and favorites."
"&gt;  He is supportive of me 100%. 

No, he's not. If he were, he'd do his share of the household work without needed to be asked or begged."
"His cousin hit her boyfriend...and you expect him to just stand there and let the cousin whale on him...?  In his own home?

You must be very sheltered."
I know this is silly. But what if the hospital gave them the wrong baby? It's happened before.
My girlfriend is entirely done with them after the wedding. She is very pissed off as well.  And from what I hear a lot of the other bridesmaids are not to happy either. 
"You seem to have a pretty good handle on your situation and you've accepted it and you've chosen to live a full life. I think if you went into it with the very serious ""I need to tell you someone major about me..."" You're setting yourself up to have to rehash old emotions and basically become tragedy theater so they can go through their emotions. 

If you set the scene where they just saw someone go through something similar and they have it in the front of their brains that people who are terminally afflicted are actual people who deserve everything non sick people have you're probably gonna get more sensitive replies. Yeah, it's a little manipulative. But at the same time, you do you, boo."
"He has to *want* to stop.  Right now, he seems to want you to *make* him stop.  That is not your job.  Tell him what your boundary is on this: you no longer will accept this behavior.  Mean it.  Tell him that failure to comply will result in you breaking up with him.

FWIW, most of the people who post here would say that interaction with another live person is cheating."
"Thanks, this really really helped."
"Seriously? God forbid men and women are friends without ever wanting to bone each other. Can we get over that horrendous trope that men and women can't be friends?


I would find it very strange if my boyfriend didn't have any female friends. It demonstrates that he only sees men as worthy of his friendship and that women only serve to be fuckable. "
"And how does this work as an adult? Literally, how are people meant to know you want or are interested in something if you don't tell them? I genuinely don't understand."
"Just in case, check the Carbon monoxide levels in your apartment."
"No, he wants people to tell him he's right. "
"I used to always think I was hyper sensitive but turns out all my friends were just assholes when I was younger.

having an emotional reaction to something doesnt necessarily mean you are being sensitive. trust your emotions. sometimes an emotional reaction is what anyone would have. sometimes crying is a valid reaction. "
People use the Old Testament laws against religious homophobes because they usually quote Leviticus first. There aren't any super handy concise quotes in the New Testament. The fact the Old Testament isn't valid is sort of the point.
"I understand that that may be the case, and I'm keeping an open mind for now. 

But attending a funeral is not a ""straw"" to me. I would never cut someone out for that. That is insanely cold-hearted and lacking any ounce of empathy for another person's situation. "
Wow.  Holy crap.  His reaction was severe.  Have you talked to him about this at all?  Did he apologize?  I think before anyone can offer advice you'll need to provide more info.
"&gt; having a hard time planning a pregnancy due to the cost of attending your wedding

Except this. Totally not necessary. Keep your business private. "
I'd disown that motherfucker so fast if he really did that. there's nothing harmless or funny about this 'prank'
OK. I'll call him now.
"&gt; Wow she's not super-enthused to be living with your age 20 rebound husband who you moved in after a few months?

Seriously. OP, you know how your husband doesn't care to get to know your son because he'll be out of the house in a ""few years""? That's in *five* years, the same amount of time since your husband's senior prom. How can you expect your kids to treat him as an authority figure?"
"&gt;You're an adult

This is such a patronizing line.

&gt;If you want a party to happen, you make it happen. 

She's turning 30 and has planned just about every event for 5+ years. She has every right to be a little upset no one puts in the same amount of effort for her. 

Your advice isn't bad, but you could phrase it a little bit nicer. "
"Do not invite him, and enjoy your wedding.  Be ready to have to tell your dad ""No"" a lot if the tries to get you to change your mind.  If your dad gives any ultimatums about if you don't invite BIL he won't go, then tell him you'll miss him - do NOT give in to any manipulation like that.  

"
"I'm the only vegetarian in my family, and sometimes we'll stop at a veg-friendly restaurant where I'll get take out, then we'll go to the restaurant the rest of my family chose and I'll eat my takeout while they eat their meat. Everyone is happy that way.  
  
And while I understand you being annoyed by her sister, your arguments against her veganism don't seem internally consistent. For example, without the basis of livestock to protect, it's much harder to argue that wiping out wolves and coyotes is a good thing. It's also very hard to argue that rural farming is okay because the animals are treated better when a lot of vegans find the core idea that animals are ours to kill and eat to be wrong.   
  
But it also seems to me that you would be happier if your sister just kept her views to herself, so I'd recommend refusing to engage with her instead of trying to argue against her beliefs. If you constantly refuse to feed her flame, she'll run out of talking points. She can only argue against herself for so long."
There were a whole group of us who were overseas through his work and all of the girls would have girls nights together. Sarah was the only one who was a little cold towards me so I went out of my way to be friendly towards her. I discussed with him how she was cold towards me and he said 'she could be a bitch sometimes' then still let me make movie nights with her etc. It's fucking sick.
I wouldn't eat off my pets either :(
"We were never a thing. Back when I was single we used to be a bit flirty, just because we were both the younger people on the team and we get along well. As soon as I entered a relationship with my boyfriend that stopped. We never dated, fucked, kissed, nothing. We are purely platonic. "
"Maybe the girlfriend gave dad the impression OP was going to propose on their anniversary?

"
"I am blind in one eye (birth defect) and absolutely no one knows unless I tell them. It's a non-issue in 99% of my life. Biggest complaint was a few years back when everything was 3D I felt like I was missing out (need both eyes to see 3D lol). A definite first world problem (to miss out on 3D). 

Edit: I'm 34, married with two kids. Survived high school without issue. Plenty of drama (unrelated to my eye) but no real issues. "
"You two only have grounds on literal points at best. Yeah you don't have any biological sisters, and yeah your mum only has one biological daughter. But are you honestly saying you wouldn't be bothered in the slightest if this was her bridal shower and two people who'd been in your life for decades just distanced you and made you nothing publicly with two sentences? I doubt you'd be so happy-go-lucky. 

Bad intentions or not, I can see where she's coming from. She's still a sister, you refer to her as your step sister. Doesn't matter how close you are or not. This isn't about the wedding, it's about her being ghosted and publicly distanced by two people she grew up with, 25% or not. "
"Don't do it. One day you'll find that all the money in ""our"" account has been used on an impulsive man toy purchase, such as a sports car or a second hand yacht."
"&gt;But I have never in a million years heard of flicking her throat hard to make her stop. If anything wouldn't that make it worse?

Yes it would make it worse. Babies can't communicate pain like adults but they feel pain just the same. Your husband is teaching your baby that when she cries to communicate her needs, she will receive pain in response. 

There is also the issue that you don't know whether or not this is the first time he has got physical with her. I would say to you ""Don't leave him alone with your daughter"" but if you can't even trust your own husband not to harm your baby, what kind of marriage is that? Your husband needs help and your daughter needs protected. "
Batman wouldn't be so idiotic in hiding his identity.
"Idk, with how it was phrased... I would have felt it was unethical not to spend it all."

"I agree with this advice but I'm curious to know what op means by the unhealthy relationship with her mother.

If one has a bad relationship with a parent, it can't be ignored because of other good relationships.

To put things in context - I dated a lady who I couldn't have a good relationship with and lean on emotionally because she had a weird relationship with her mom where mom was the third person in our relationship.

Mom knew everything, mom judged and snuck her talons into every situation between me and the girl.

I am curious to know what the situation was with op and mom. Regardless, these two were clearly incompatible so it seems like this was the best."
"Yup. OP, you can bite your tongue on the wedding planning if that's what you really want to do, but that won't change anything in the long run. Your in-laws will expect to determine all sorts of things. Your husband will roll right over. Think about it this way: they've thrown down over something relatively unimportant in the grand scheme of things. What do you think is going to happen when the issue actually matters? "
"I can only imagine what the poor RV would look like after college students lived in it for a few years. 

Stand your ground, OP. Tell your mom, ""I stopped letting family use my RV because they were trashing it. You've got 5 bedrooms in your house; they can stay there."" When she says it isn't your RV because you bought it ""with Dad's money"", say, ""If we're talking about Dad's money, why don't you give the cousins some of your money you got from Dad? Why am I the only one expected to share my inheritance?"""
"Hey OP, I already responded but I wanted to draw your attention to this: 

&gt;I prefer to work through problems instead of giving up immediately.

I'm guessing this is the reason you didn't immediately break up with your last boyfriend when he became abusive? Just please, please be careful. Not every problem can be worked through. You've been through the cycle of abuse, you know how it starts."
"The treatment for Chlamydia is an antibiotic.  I am pretty sure there are not any strains of antibiotic resistant Chlamydia yet. So this shouldn't be a reason for a c section, it should be as simple as ten days of pills. 

I am also pretty sure it can be transmitted during birth, but this is why testing is typically done during pregnancy. Its fairly common in the us to have a full std panel at some point in the pregnancy. "

Just make them dig themselves into a bigger and bigger hole. If it's in a public setting they will eventually humiliate themselves. The key is to not let them get under your skin and just lead them off the cliff they are already sprinting towards. Then step outta the way and watch as they go down in flames. Watch yourself when  these kind of idiots humiliate themselves with their own stupidity they may lash out physically.

"Just to play devil's advocate, how would her company know she isn't just making it up? It's a he said she said thing as this point. Moving her seems like a reasonable compromise given the situation."
"Also, apparently telling someone you *can't* have kids still incites the ""omg she wants to have my babies!"" panic. Because obviously being trapped by a pregnancy is a threat from ALL women, even infertile ones. "
"She's not stupid - she's 18. She's ignorant of how the world works, and when some guy with a house and a car who knows all the right things to say starts showering her with attention, she's going to respond the same way any 18-year-old would. 

That's precisely *why* users like him look for young women like her. She doesn't have any common sense because this is the part of her life where she's supposed to be getting the experiences that imbue a person with the sense that the rest of us see as ""common."""

"Eric was putting his arm around OP in front of Jake and she was telling herself he was just a friend. That is willful ignorance.  I struggle to understand all these people willing to absolve OP of her actions just because Eric pursued her. Ultimately, she let him and didn't shut it down.

OP is the one who dumped Jake for being controlling when he was right all along.  OP made a series on mistakes over months, at best."
Ew yeah what is that about?  Very weird.  Either boss was faking acting surprised or... something very strange is happening there.
"In fact, in Catholicism it's almost *expected* that even saints will experience a period of doubt in their lives.  Doubt and questioning isn't antithetical to religion, it's just that fundamentalists have taken religion and skewed it to the point that questions and doubt are the same as blasphemy. 

When I was younger, I went through a period of doubt and atheism, the whole works. And I'm thankful I had a mother and extended family that, despite being devout and pretty conservative, were surprisingly open to debates and questions. Eventually I chose to go back to my faith, but having people who were willing to talk to me about any choice I made was a big help. OP could be that person for his kids. And then they can make that decision for themselves."
"Well, I can't tell you why she wants to cuddle as I am not your GF however I can speculate. There are two glaring possibilities that I am thinking of *might* be why.

The first, less likely but still the initial thing I thought, is that she has some trauma associated with past relationships and physical touch and/or something psychologically against those types of actions. If it was more a confinement issue (i.e. freaking out when tickled a second too long even though she was seemingly enjoying it before, getting uncomfortable and panicking after a while of happy snuggling in your arms, etc.) I'd say that it is most likely.

However, then you dropped the bombs that both of you are virgins, and I re-checked the ages. I remember back to when I was a virgin who had never kissed, held hands, etc. and I remember feeling extremely nervous to do any of that. The first time I held hands, my whole body shook and I got so nervous that my palms were gross and warm and sweaty and this made me all gross and sweaty and then I panicked and thought how my sweaty, sweaty palms might be making the guy uncomfortable which made me pull my hand away quickly and not want to do it anymore. When I dated my first BF it took us a lot of tries and a long time to finally get me comfortable. Every new step was a huge thing (kissing, laying for a long period of time, snuggling, etc.) I was uncomfortable even mildly undressed and every step of the way was awkward. 

Point being, from my outsider perspective it seems to me that she's still in the phase I went through about 10 years earlier than your GF where she's nervous about everything, panicking, etc. Even over 6 months in dating my best friend at the time, I didn't feel ready to have sex at all and was still uncomfy with some physical contact and being seen naked. It was a mixture of insecurity, nervousness, excitement, new experiences, etc. that comes with being inexperienced and in love. 

Additionally, it could be that she IS feeling a bit pressured to do things past what she is comfortable with. Your language here, while unintentional, can be perceived as pressuring.

&gt; ""I never knew someone would hate cuddles but she's the one.""

&gt; ""It hurt, but I shouldn't have expected much anyways""

&gt; ""When I'd ask why she feels this way she always avoids the question. For my birthday, I asked her if she could try to cuddle with me just once as a birthday gift and she got really emotional and said it would make her really uncomfortable""

I mean it's 3 months in and while for many people these kinds of things (cuddling, kissing, sex, etc.) can be considered ""normal"" to do in relationships this is a special case since you both are still virgins. Perhaps she has never cuddled? Perhaps your holding hands is one of her first times and it terrifies her? Perhaps she thinks it'll be like a slippery slope and she just doesn't feel ready? Pushing the question and asking her is just having her put up more defenses; expressing your hurt and sadness over it is also making her feel guilty on top of pressured.

Now, i don't think you are wrong or have done anything hurtful at all nor do I think you shouldn't hold back from expressing yourself-- that is not what I mean. I am just saying this is all probably still new to her. But that's just my guess. Who knows- could be a mix of all of it and could be something totally unrelated.

Right now I'd say the best thing to do in this situation is to be patient, supportive, and wait until she is ready. However, nobody but her will know if she is ready, and I would not blame you if, as a 27 yr old man, you were not comfortable with waiting indefinitely either. So the decision really is yours. But I sincerely do not believe pushing and expressing hurt each time is going to be met with anything besides more hesitance and anxiety from your SO. Just take it one step at a time and support her all the way- this is special and new and scary :)!

 Lastly, stop making goals the way you are both making them please! Talking about sex and a specific general timeline you expect to both be ready is SUPER pressure-y and not a way I'd want to go about it. Instead you might want to consider the most likely activity that will next happen (i.e. hand holding or kissing or tickles or snuggles or foot rubs or whatever) and *in your mind* plan for those goals. For example, rather than out of the blue trying to hold her hand, why not wait until it just feels natural? Now that isn't to say you shouldn't plan for sex- as I think you should have condoms and she should probably be on some type of birth control as well in order to avoid unplanned accidents, however the ""when you feel comfortable"" is unknown and NOT something you can schedule! Point being, hope and dream for the next baby step ahead but don't try to schedule it like a dentist appointment. Be adequately prepared for all times (whether by hand santizer and lotion to prepare that right hand for the best hand holding experience or a properly stored, wrapped condom) and attempt actions when it just feels ""right"" for both of you. No pressure. Hopefully i explained that OK"
"Yeah. I just responded to another person asking the same questions, but the short of it is that it's almost certainly his idea. She never mentioned wanting this many kids even right before they were married. I only heard her want 1 or 2 at most, so I'm sure he's pushed a lot of this on her. 

I don't know if I would say it's religious because our protestant denomination isn't known for it, but my stepdad does come from a large family so that probably it. "

"ITT: Butt hurt cam girls.

Let's be real here for a minute - ""camming"" is  the variety of prostitution. Just like ""real"" prostitutes, cam girls/guys are engaging in sexual activity with someone for payment. No matter how much we sugarcoat this with feeling good sentiments , fact is not going to change.

I am not going to discuss moral side of the prostitution. I want to point out that this is deal breaker occupation  for a lot of people.  

Questionable profession aside OP's girlfriend is liar who is trying  to gain moral high ground by pulling ""my body, my rights"" card. This sentiment has tons of validity in the right situations but in this case it's just sorry ass excuse. Lying is also very common deal breaker.

In short, OP's (ex) gf is lying prostitute and people are upset why is he angry? I mean, fuck's sake!

what the actual fuck 
"So you found out that six months before he dated you, he ended a four year relationship.

You also found out that if you got pregant he might be OK with an unplanned baby.

Neither of these seem particularly concerning to me. "
"&gt;Let fantasy stay in fantasy world. Don't worry about it.

+1.  People should just step back and ask themselves ""Has this had any actual negative effect on our lives?"" before they get worked up about things.  

If it starts expressing itself in some way that causes problem, *then* you can be concerned."
"I think part of the issue here might be that your fiancee has different and far more normal/mainstream expectations for bodily functions.

Most people don't wet the bed after a night of drinking. You seem to think it's fairly normal, and something you'd expect from someone in your family. But for most people, they'd have to be EXTREMELY drunk and out of it to have an accident like that. It's not normal, and if it IS normal for someone, that would indicate to me that they're extremely drunk on a regular basis.

She probably doesn't buy your explanation of ""hey, my whole family has weak bladders!"" because it's not normal, and doesn't sound healthy. It is much more likely, in her mind, that your brother is some sort of closet drunk who regularly gets so drunk that he passes out and loses control of his bodily functions.

So...I think the first thing you need to do is reiterate that this is a physiological issue that you and a lot of people in your family struggle with. Maybe, if she believes that instead of her original idea that he's a degenerate drunk she'll be more forgiving.

Buying a new couch though, totally unreasonable. "
Or worse: When she *is* home
"So, you're giving yourself up to another year, to... commit... to committing to her.

Looks like you're going to have to learn the hard way, OP, when she dumps your ass for your lack of commitment.  You are holding her back.  Not nice.  If you're serious about your gf, TREAT HER SERIOUSLY.  By the time you're ""ready"" I hope she's able to get past the resentment you allowed to grow in her all this time.
"
"The tests need to be random, frequent (how long after a drink do breathalyzer results still indicate alcohol consumption?), and followed by immediate positive reinforcement if the results are good. 

Also, be sure that you present it as the two of you on the same team against the disease that is alcoholism. If your wife is drinking, it's not because she wants to be hurting the child, she's feeling self recrimination and shame. If she turns to you for support, you'll have a better chance of helping her and your child. "
"OP, why post if you're going to ignore everyone's answers? Stop justifying your boyfriend's ABUSIVE behavior. 

He is yelling at you and swearing at you in public. How is that okay? It makes you feel scared! He got ANGRY at you when you told him you were scared. He made you go to the store in the middle of the night. 

I forget things occasionally, we all do. You know what has NEVER happened? I've never been yelled at, cursed at, for forgetting. Never. "
"Unfortunately, your roommate sees you as a pushover. He has discovered that he can do whatever he likes. He doesn't *have* to look after the apartment, because eventually you'll deal with the dishwasher/trash can/cat litter/whatever without him lifting a finger. He finds reasonable ways ""in"" with his bad habits: you used to smoke together occasionally, so lying in bed with all the windows closed all day must be fine too. You cautiously allowed the friend to stay over, so that must mean she can live there now and come and go as she pleases.

Unfortunately, his entitled behavior does not really mesh well with the ""just talk to him"" approach, since you have tried that and he demonstrated immunity to polite confrontation. If her name is not on the lease, remind your roommate of this in-person, followed by ""Sarah has stayed longer than I agreed to, and she has not followed the guidelines I presented to you when I agreed she could temporarily stay here. Therefore, if she is not gone in *insert reasonable length of time here*, I will take this to the landlord."" Since this guy doesn't seem the knock-down-drag-out type, I imagine a strongly worded conversation would be enough to send her packing.

Lastly, verify that there is not a ""no smoking"" clause in your lease. If you try to move out and your whole house smells like weed/tobacco because your roommate can't be bothered to regularly smoke outside, you will lose your security deposit and may be liable to pay for carpet deep cleaning or whatever else it takes to get the stank out of your apartment. Just a thought."
"When I was a kid my mom told me if I ran away that the police would arrest me, keep me naked in a concrete room, spray me down with insecticide to kill all the bugs I'd have on me, other things I'd rather not say(she loved to use vulgar images and words when punishing us)... I was probably 14 or 15 when she started saying that and I believed her. She also made sure to tell us since we were little that if CPS ever took us away we'd be sent to a worse home where we'd be molested, starved, and beaten, so we couldn't talk about what happened at home to anyone else. I can completely agree that OP may really believe this, especially since he said his brother is in Law and as his authority figure he wouldn't have much reason to not believe him."
"Your biggest problem is self confidence. Worrying about the attention your husband may get is pointless.

You need to start figuring out how to boost it. Confidence is sexy. If you are constantly giving your husband needy approval requests.  That will be the turn off long. Only you can work your strengths. 

Your husband picked you to marry. You should use that as reassurance. Are you fun, happy, supportive, reliable, confident, take action, willing to grow individual? Or are you just an insecure complainer. 

Are you only with your husband because of his looks? Imagine what you would feel about him if he just stared acting defeated all the time. 

If you worry about loosing him. Realize it will be your long term attitude that drives him away. 

Time to figure how to turn that around. 

"
I dated a guy who had a list he wouldn't disclose. It was his way of not committing. I walked away from that mess. 
"Yeah, because he didn't talk to the kids. Sounds like he never tried. 

And her insulting you has everything to do with resenting him. She's likely doing it to hurt him. How do you not see that?"
Do these parents *want* their kids to start fucking?  Because this is how you get your kids to start fucking...
And I'm just sitting here wondering wtf batting is
"I could upvote every post here so far. This guy is a horrible partner. Abusive, controlling and will make your life hell. Run away!



You're only 18, you don't need your entire life to be fucked up by this douchebag. 

Being pregnant complicates things, but I'd urge you to consider abortion or adoption. "
"I think the point here is that he knows women his age won't put up with his behavior, so he targets the young and naive who don't know any better and can be fooled into thinking that type of abuse is normal. I agree that a relationship with an age gap doesn't necessarily mean the older one is a shitty person - but if you're already a shitty person you have better luck getting away with it by dating someone younger."
Tell your parents that you don't feel okay about it. Show them this thread if need be.
"&gt; I’m heartbroken, I fell in love despite my never wanting it

Let me fix that for you: I'm heartbroken, I fell in love ~~despite my never wanting it~~ because I place precisely zero value on my marriage and made a series of incredibly dumb decisions."
"I also didn't like my husband's proposal (although it wasn't quite as bad as yours). I'm kind of the opposite of OP's girlfriend -- I didn't care at all about a fancy proposal but I just wanted it to be really personal and intimate. My husband rented us a boat on a trip to seattle and did it there, which was fine, but he was so nervous/anxious about the proposal (and driving/parking the boat, which he is not used to) that we weren't having a good time leading up to the proposal and it was pretty lame. Later, when we got back to our hotel room, we were having intimate cute times and he was playing with the ring. He asked me to give him a foot massage. I started rubbing his feet without looking at them and felt the ring around one of his toes. I thought that would have been a much better way to propose! We were having a good time and it would have been so cute and made me laugh and it would be a reflection of our relationship because that's not the kind of proposal you would do with just anyone.


BUT, we have just about the most wonderful marriage imaginable and some proposals just kind of suck but it's certainly not always representative of the marriage. As long as you can discuss and learn from things like that."
"I have, I brought a ring and ask. I took advise I saw here. Didn't do it in public and didn't get down on one knee. I made a nice dinner, afterwards I told him he makes me feel so special and amazing and I want him in my life. I got the ring and asked him. He laughed, placed the ring down and went to the kitchen to clean. Told him I was seriously asking him and he said he knows but he wants to ask me. The ring is on my desk at home as he won't take it. This happened a year ago. "
"It could be she has a morals clause. Depending on where she lives/where the company is based out of, they may or may not specifically state that she can't be out as a lesbian, but there could be weasel wording about ""upholding the company's brand."" Or it could be a situation where if she came out, they'd find some other reason to break her contract or otherwise penalize her."
"Okay so I don't care about your friend's sexuality. Like honestly, you cheated on your girlfriend. Emotionally, physically. You are lying to her every single day. It would benefit her to know NOW. You are making it worse every day you wake up, you text her, you say i love you, because it is all based on a foundation of lies that you DIDN'T cheat on her.

Tell her right now. Tell her, and leave her alone so she can sort through this and she will probably dump you. Do not blame her, YOU cheated. YOU lied. Be a good person and own up to the wrong you committed."
"Or getting paid. 

I get that the hookup culture exists, but *every three days!?* Usually girls looking to go home with random guys don't hang out in bars on weekdays. I'll bet anything this brother is either taking home hookers or druggies. "
"Worth noting, generally someone making 2x doesn't take home double, because their tax bill as a percentage of salary is higher. 

The general point still works though."
"Pinning you down to the bed and **preventing you from leaving** is way out of line and controlling/abusive. You're not a bad person for it. Take a step back and ask yourself if you're happy in this relationship, if he treats you with respect and empathy, and **if you feel safe** with him. If not, it may be time to leave."
"OP: after I had my triplets and went back to work, I discovered that the disabled stall in my office's restroom had a rail that I could rest my head on while sitting on the lid-closed toilet. I used to take mini naps every day. "
"The roommate *is* a huge creeper, it's no assumption. You can't just go spying on people when they're naked on the off chance that they're into it and that it makes it okay."
"if someone did that to me and i found out, i would break up with them"
Why the fuck are you dating this person.
"Something else is going on. I've been in the field for a long time. No professors meet anyone for for 5 hours, let alone an undergraduate. That person has shit to do. Seriously there is another reason she is there for so long and ignoring you. How often do they meet?"
"Go sit down with one of the family members. Brother is probably a good place to start. Tell him you are concerned for the mental health of mil and explain she posts and texts 'omg you hate meeeee!!' if you dare to do something like have dinner without her. And you believe you should be able to have a life without her constant backhand remarks when all you are doing is living your life. Make him read all the texts. Screenshot as many of the nasty comments and show him the overwhelming amount of crap directed your way. 

Then say you have blno idea how to fix it but her texts are really off-putting and you don't want to be a part of her pity party. So you are cutting her off until she learns to calm down and not try to make every dinner and action all about her. You deserve to spend time with all of your family not just her. 

Then see where that takes you. At least someone else will have their eyes opened to both sides. 

This is your biggest problem, no one is hearing your side and seeing the crazy texts you are getting. Hell, screenshot the whole batch and post it on fb. That way your side will be out there too. The squeaky wheel is getting the grease on this one. "
"I read some of your comments, and I'm relieved to hear you're evaluating your relationship. I thought I'd share my experience and perspective. 

I met my current boyfriend when I was 18 and he was 29. We had a ton of reservations about dating due to the age gap, and our relationship was probably only successful because we acknowledged the imbalance that an age gap can cause and took every precaution to prevent that. He didn't want to hinder my college experience, so I was mindful to stay engaged with campus life. Two years in when we had the opportunity to move in together, we mutually decided to wait so I could experience having a place of my own, too. We finally moved in together after 4 years of dating, and we found a new apartment so neither of us would feel prior claim to the place. Even though he makes more than me, I pay all my bills and share of rent. Our social circle is evenly balanced between my original friends, his original friends, and friends we've made as a couple. My family adores him and consider him like a son. We're still not married because we see no rush.

I can't help but compare experiences and see red flags in your current situation. I feel like as the older one in the relationship, your husband has/had the responsibility of taking things slow and with you and allowing you proper time to grow into your young adult years. Instead within 3 years he already has you as a wife, sharing his home, and partially raising his kids. That seems so reckless. 

In addition, he is calling the shots on every major decision you have as a couple. Expectations of privacy, cohabitation arrangement, where/how you live (was his house), the pre-nup and all your finances, how you deal with the ex wife, if you keep working, to have or not to have children... Everything is going his way. You just ""deal with it"" and adjust your expectations every single time and make excuses for ""the way he is"". Or in the rare cases it does go in your favor (no boat travel), he lords it over you as some huge sacrifice you'll never reciprocate. Even though you have sacrificed so much more. And you know it-- I know you do-- but you just don't feel like you have to accept it.

Please take care of yourself and keep doing this work of evaluating your marriage. I commend you for considering a lot of dissenting opinions in this thread.

"B-But but but people change!! Your dad is sorry! He was crying and said he was sad!! /sssss 

My dad pulled those lines and my aunt fell for it hook line and sinker.

"
"Don't get her pregnant.  It's seriously as simple as that.

You have been dating 2.5 months, a baby isn't like a puppy or a kitten.  It is a serious commitment.  Think of it like this... She is going to be pregnant almost 3x longer than the amount of time you have even known each other!  Not to mention the 18+ years it will take to raise it.  

Dont. do. it.  Don't. do. it.  For the love of god... DON'T DO IT."
"Basically, blue eyes develops from a mutation in at least one of two specific genes. The only way the child would be brown eyed is if one parent has mutation in gene one, and the other parent has mutation in gene 2. Then a genetic recombination event occurs (basically crossing over of genes which mixes up the genes). However, these genes are so close on the chromosome, that if recombination occurs, it is highly unlikely that the genes one and two would be separated in the child. So since they aren't separated, the child will have the same genes as the parent, in other words they would have blue eyes. It can get more complicated than that, but long story short is that it is rare, not impossible, to have brown eyes from blue eyed parents."
"Just a side note, science classes in primary/elementary/middle schools usually don't mention the exceptions and rare occurrences to avoid confusion and make learning the basics easier. "
It honestly felt like the right thing to do. I'm gonna plan something for just the two of us like a hike or something. We haven't gotten to do something like that for a few months.
"This - also read ""The Gift of Fear"""
He doesn't sound like he would be a good role model for how to treat a spouse either.
"This x 100.  Being bisexual is one thing, being non-monogamous is another, and being a cheater is something else entirely.  If she needed to explore that badly, that's a conversation she should have had with you, OP."

"&gt;  It's a cultural norm in the US.

This is actually definitely not true for all Americans, whatever people on the Internet keep insisting, and she makes it absolutely clear that it's not the norm in her country anyway so that's totally irrelevant. Edit: I see OP is in America now, but I don't think it changes things that much honestly.  It makes it slightly worse, honestly, if she went into that conversation as: ""In my country we never do this, so it bothers me that I might be dating somebody here who's doing it.""

&gt; I can't for the life of me understand why you would consider throwing away a great relationship with someone over the fact that he dated casually before committing to you.

You read her post and you think this is why she's upset?  She's upset because she *said* she didn't want to date him if he was dating other people, and he said, ""Okay, sure."" and went ahead and did it anyway.  What other inconveniences is he likely to lie away in the future?

You can date casually all you want, but if you're dating somebody who says *I don't want to date anybody who's doing that*, would you just keep them in the dark about it?  After all, you can date so much more efficiently that way! "
You are berating her for not making a decision already. Lay off. No one is going to be able to compartmentalize something like this as efficiently as you seem to think.
Seriously...does she think Kleenex makes so much money because of all the sneezing going on?
"My husband would LOOOOOOVE a Tesla too.

But if I asked him about being given a Tesla in his favourite colour - when you don't own a home, still owe for tuition and don't have the means to pay those off - I think he'd snort in derision.  What good is a car that will lose $50k off the value as soon as you start the engine, but you still have to repay your student loans and save for a home and still finance the cost of running the thing?"
"I really love my neighbor (he's a single dad and I babysit for him when he needs it) and he's going to drive my car out to his kids football practice this evening (about 20 miles to the east) while I go up to the apple store with a friend in their car. So if Kenneth follows one or the other of us, we can really nail it down how he's been pulling it off. "
"Hi,

&amp;nbsp;

I want you to hear me.
My father left when I was 11 and I never saw him again. My mother and I were never really close, but from then on it was just her and I. She has always had low self-esteem and once my father left, she fell into a depression and a state of denial she has not been able to get out of since. She has a lot of issues that she refuses to face. Once my grandmother passed away (her mother) it got much worse. To this day, she cannot talk about my grandmother without completely breaking down, which is 10 years later. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am a different person. I am focused on self-development and I want to be the best version of myself that I can. I want to work through all of the issues I have so that I can lead a better and happier life. I was so unhappy at home with her. I lived in my bedroom. The most I can give her credit for is keeping me alive and even that is a stretch. We never had any money because she wouldn't get a steady job. It was so hard for me to be at home with her. To be in that environment that was so depressing and so stale. When I was your age, I started staying at friends' houses more often and slowly, I went home less and less until I finally moved out at 17. The decision to do that itself was not difficult, but the process of doing it and telling her that I was leaving was something I dreaded and it was very painful. At this point, we had no other family. I was all she had left. She was all I had left. And I had a hard time making the choice to do what was best for me because it meant that I would be hurting her. 

&amp;nbsp;

We didn't talk for a couple of years. Then we got in contact again and every time I spoke with her on the phone, she would be crying to me about her problems and I would try and try to help her and give her advice. She would never do anything different. I kept thinking maybe it's because I didn't try this other thing or that I just wasn't trying hard enough. I felt so sorry for her - I still do. I would help her in any way I could. I mean, she's my mother. I do love her. One time, I traveled an hour to her apartment to give her money so she could get groceries. I couldn't even go inside to see her, I left it in her mailbox. It was far too painful. Every time we spoke, I would get off the phone in tears, absolutely depressed. Every time the phone rang, I had a panic attack. The pain of having to ""be the parent"" all those years took a toll on me. I felt so helpless. And I resented her for not nurturing *me*. For not being good to herself. For not facing reality. And really, I still do feel that way. 
But I learnt I can't fix her.

&amp;nbsp;

This year marks 2 years that I have been ""no contact"" with her. There is LOTS more to this story, but the point is this:
I know **so deeply** the pain a child can feel when their parent is in pain and will not help themselves. When a parent is failing you by not taking care of themselves. I know how it feels to feel responsible for that and to try in any way that you can to make it better. I know how much it hurts to see someone you love in so much pain. I know what it's like to not have any other support around to help you navigate the situation. 
The hardest thing to realize is this --- the only person who can help your mother is your mother. And I do not want you to exhaust yourself taking responsibility for her. In the end, you *need* to do what is best for you. It will feel selfish. It is not. It will certainly be painful. 
But she brought *you* into this world, not the other way around.

&amp;nbsp;

I am not saying stop helping your mother right this moment. But please, please keep all of this in mind and know that 
1. it is not your responsibility to fix her 
2. you will most likely not be able to fix her, even if you try in every way possible and 
3. things *will* get better for you, alright?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sorry you've been put in this situation. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. And I extend to you my understanding and well wishes that your mother gets the help she needs. 
For more practical advice, she needs to speak with a professional. 
If you want to talk, I'm here and happy to do that.
"
"If you accrued it in secret during the relationship when you had multiple times to come clean and lied about having it, yeah."
She was being hella suspicious.  He thought he was being cheated on. 
"I was the coworker of a woman in your situation.  We got on really well at work, but I was really surprised when she asked me to be in her wedding party.  

What was really nice about it was that even though we weren't super close before she got engaged, going through all the wedding stuff together allowed us to get to know each other and by the time she got married, we actually *were* close enough to justify it!  If you get along well with certain people at work, it might be worth the risk in the end!"
"You know. That's what I'm thinking. If it wasn't a temporary break. If it was a permanent one, then that'd be fine, but she said she wanted to see me in Oct. 

That's the only thing that's screwing with my mind. What to do with my plane tickets D:"
"Not necessarily. This is a gender roles/physical attraction thing and the two are somewhat intertwined and socially learned. Women may be less attracted to men who are shorter and/or skinnier than them. Their subconscious (real or perceived, I'm a feminist and not an evo-psych fan so I don't like this explanation) ""need for protection"" isn't being met. Likewise, many men wouldn't be attracted to women larger than themselves.

I've dated guys the same height and weight as myself and it was just weird 'cause they couldn't pick me up and swing me around and...uh, ahem. ;P

Sorry if that causes any offense, I'm obviously not saying there's anything _wrong_ with that lack of physical differential in opposite-sex couples because, yeah. Just that some people feel that way or are socially conditioned to feel that way or whatever. Yanno. "
"Yup. So many people seem to present it as a ""I was so besotted with you that I just wanted a chance"" but it's not flattering. At all. 

It's like lying about being qualified for something so you could get it... Oh, except that thing is a person and that person is you. How romantic! */s*."
"I wouldn't say that you snooped, since this is all information out there on the internet, free for anyone to look at. 

I would just tell her. Explain that you saw it, and that you're fine with it, and you're impressed by her entrepreneurial spirit. Hopefully she'll just be relieved you're cool with it. "
The coach and the mom. Where are the goddamned responsible adults in this kid's life?!
"There's a finite time to reach him, we'll do our best before he flies out"
"I get what you're saying, and he probably does love you in his own way. But it isn't the way you deserve to be loved by the man you'll marry: completely, and to the exclusion of all others.

If he had really been trying to move past his feelings for Bailey, he would have by now. Chances are he's been indulging this, feeding it, and checking in on it for years. He may think it's harmless, but it certainly has hurt you, and you're right to be hurt. Only you can decide if you want to work on this, and if there's some way that you could trust his feelings for you in the future, but it's okay if the answer is simply that you can't."
"You certainly have a good reason to be upset. What his friend said was really insulting and the least your boyfriend could have done was acknowledge that what his friend said was tacky and inappropriate and reassure you that you're not ugly and he finds you beautiful. That's the least he could've done, and he didn't even do it.

I'm not sure whether your suspicion that your boyfriend doesn't think you're attractive is true or not though. Maybe he has an overly positive opinion of his friend and doesn't want to believe that he has done anything wrong. Either way, I think you should try to talk to your boyfriend again, and really put your foot down and insist that he take you seriously. Maybe if he sees how affected you are by it then he'll stop dismissing your feelings. "
"&gt;I need to know how to deal with this. At this point I'm leaning towards opening up and telling him all of this as soon as possible.

That is what you need to do. A relationship should make you happy. If he wants to work on making you happy he will understand and try to change. Having sex once a week should be the minimum, come on."
"Can confirm. Was underage dating a 20-something-year-old who used to bite me whenever I made him angry. It got to the point where he would do it ridiculously hard then play it off as ""joking"", every single time. I had bruises in many places and the only person to ever say anything about it was a teacher I had a good relationship with. I told her my nephew bit me but the bruises (on my arms, was summer) didn't stop and she threatened to contact a social worker or the police if it kept happening. I brought this up to him and his response was ""Ok, I won't bite you there anymore"". I knew what he was doing but it didn't feel like abuse so I minimized it and also didn't fully understand what was going on at the time. It's not that I was brainwashed or anything, I simply wasn't educated on the fact that abuse came in forms other than slapping, punching, etc. I didn't actually think about it until years later and the first thing that crossed my head was ""Man, this guy was actually trying to hurt me. On purpose"". Except I understood the severity of it this time. That was long ago but I still have pictures of the recorded abuse on my laptop. It's literally just pictures from different days and bruises on different places over the span of many months. I guess even my immature self knew I should keep proof of what was happening, at least for myself. To know it was real and not something I made up myself."
"She should be able to handle it herself, this is basic stuff boundaries bro if she needs you to be the savior, she's either using you, or she's damaged... If she can't draw boundaries and stick to em, run bro... Don't turn back just run, with the newspapers though... Good luck"
It is kind of relevant that neither of you have the set sleeping schedule with early mornings that jobs require. That would probably solve several problems all at once

"I don't think that is what he is asking. Poorly worded, but I think we all get the idea of what exactly he means. Come on now. "
"Be careful adding alcohol to your dryer, particularly if gas heated.  Let it air out for a day afterward.  If the ink is well-dried, rubbing with glycerine can help.

edit: Typo."
I was thinking something along these lines as well. Maybe the local regulatory authority for Vets have some arcane rule governing the charging of services.
"Unless she expressed that she feels it is her fault, he *shouldn't* say that nothing is her fault over and over because that's just going to make her wonder if he actually *does* think it's her fault.

Inept school counselors do this to kids when it comes to family problems all the time and it really is just a great way to convince them that the adults all *do* think that it's their fault. Otherwise, why would they deny it so hard? Why are they trying to convince me, a kid, that I should have ever felt responsible to begin with??

As a kid, I never took on any of the blame for anything between my parents but it definitely felt like adults wanted me to feel guilty when they kept trying to convince me that something I didn't feel was my fault to begin with was not my fault. 

Similar to, ""the lady doth protest too much."""
While nice and snarky this isn't useful at all
"It seems weird to me that he's there so often. Your side of the story is only one, and I don't mean to be harsh in any way, but maybe your relationship had been on the rocks for awhile? Did or do you fight often?


It's just that I can't imagine someone being happy with their significant other and then needing to lie about going to a friend's house (the working late excuse). I have a gut feeling there's more to this."
It was deleted do u know what the person said?
"&gt; It's okay to want more out of your sex life (or less). It's not okay to pressure your partner into acts they're not interested in.

Ding ding ding.

OP, if you need way more sexually than this girl is comfortable with, that's totally fine! Break up with her. Do NOT try and get her to do a bunch of things she's uncomfortable with. "
"His concerns are about the emotional health of the family, he just doesn't know how to express that in a way that gets through to you because you immediately jump to a defensive position.

The are a lot of small ways that he will probably be right about this. If he's already the ""dad"" of your social circle then that means he takes on an active, organizing role and thinks of lots of contingencies so that things go smoothly for others. That can feel burdensome when you're watching other people get to be more free and relaxed about things in life because you're taking care of the less exciting logistics for them. 

Really think about specific instances that make you think of him as being this dad-like figure. What is he doing in those moments? How are people treating him? Do they respect him but never really make him central to the fun? How do you think being him in those situations feels? 

The gist of what I'm getting from his comments to you are that he feels kind of left out and burdened with responsibility while others have fun. He foresees this as being a stable pattern that's going to go forward into the parenting behavior you two will share. He sounds somewhat resigned to it, but that he'd at least like for you to acknowledge that this might happen and find ways to take some of that burden of being the more reliably even keeled parent off of his shoulders so that he can have fun too. 

Often fun people can be a bit erratic and flighty with some of the more boring tasks in a shared life falling to others to handle. I think this is probably true of you to some degree and he wants some reassurance that you two can work together to make sure his emotional needs for fun and positive interactions are still being met even if his role in your relationship continues to be the one who takes on more responsibilities. 

You're not going to get anywhere on this if you're in denial of what you're actually already telling us about your relationship. Any time you have a ""dad"" or ""mom"" in the friend group, they're often the one babysitting the drunks, holding other's bags so they can go on the rides, or organizing everyone's transportation on a group trip. It's an emotional burden to be the one who is the most reliable. And it's often thankless too because no one wants to admit that they are pushing off a greater share of the burdens in the relationship onto their partner in order to have fun. 

But he obviously feels that way about your relationship or he would not have brought this up, so regardless of your personal opinion you do have an issue in your relationship that you will need to face. Being defensive about it won't make him stop feeling burdened or worrying about how things will work when children come along. Invalidating his feelings on this as false doesn't even seem like the reality you yourself actually experience, so take a breath and give it a more objective, less defensive look. "
"&gt;but ""clingy"" isn't a bad thing in my opinion...it's pretty much my ideal relationship

That's your problem, not hers. She has a perfectly normal social life. You need to get over your issues."
"You can certainly ask her to stop bashing your father to you, as it makes you uncomfortable - but yes, it's completely unreasonable to expect her not to discuss her emotional matters with her friends, especially after a long marriage and a divorce. That's what friends are FOR."
I really enjoy when people try and empathise with OP and be helpful instead of just abusing them for making a mistake. Good on you. 
Wow where on earth did you get the idea that she was waking him up out of choice so he could figuratively (or literally) hold her hand?
"&gt;Do I continue with the divorce or not?  

The fact that you think it's up to you is hilarious to me.  You cheated on her and she left you.  You're getting a divorce whether you want one or not."
"""We were a generally happy couple up until a year and a half ago... {...} Less than a year ago I made an account on a dating site...""

Geez, OP. You gave up on your entire marriage after only six months of ""trying"" with ""couples therapy"" etc. and just decided you were better off cheating? 

What, did you go to one or two therapy sessions with your wife and decide it just wasn't for you because you didn't like being told you are responsible for how you act and treat people? 

You gave up. After a whole six months of things not going well. And now that your wife has accepted the kind of man she married for who he is and agreed to a divorce, you want her back? If I were her, I'd laugh so hard in your face I'd need stitches. "

"&gt;Am I wrong in thinking she's needlessly shutting down a fun celebration? 

Yes.  It might not be fun for her.  Some people hate being the center of attention.  Her opinion of parties is different than yours, it doesn't mean that it's wrong.

And her mother might be using you as a way to annoy her daughter.  She (mom) might know damn well that your GF hates parties, but mom LOVES them and wants one regardless of what GF says, so she's dragging you into this shitstorm.

"You should be prepared for lots of people to tell you that you're too young to get yourself tied down into raising someone else's kid.  Of course you should be open and honest about it, you're not ashamed, right?  Your friends and family will have good points to make about how you're going to have to put your dreams for the future aside, that your girlfriend will always have to put the kid above you, and those things are true.  I'd suggest gracefully taking advice and comments like that and simply say that it's your life and you can choose to spend it raising someone else's kid if that's what you choose to do.  "

"I really don't think that's fair though! If it works for you great but any other love language and everyone would be up in arms. I, personally, scored a 0 on touch and words of affirmation was my second lowest. Of course those were my boyfriend's two highest, I don't just not do them because I don't understand them though. It's not okay to ignore your partners needs, in my opinion."
"Except that Dan already burned the bridge. After he made you build it. And lied to you about how great a bridge it is, and how he'll totally use it all the time. It is not causing drama to react appropriately to a serious personal and professional dicking over.

It sucks having to carefully manage any kind of emotional response while sidestepping the widdew feewings of douches like Dan as a woman in business. But if you're worried about how to explain that, think about it like this - beyond your totally reasonable and appropriate emotional response, your not continuing a close relationship is a business decision. He wasted your time, real tangible billable hours. He *stole* from you, OP. Either fifteen hours of half your usual rate, or fifteen hours of your full rate if he's not paid at all, plus lost potential income from the other client relationships you could have been tending, and exposure/potential income from referrals had they used the work you did for them and others saw it.

Fuck a vacay. Use the great above wording of pressed, remain cordial of aloof with Dan if yours is the kind of business where you'll run in to him or his partners again, and go with your SO later. Let him feel how he feels - you planned the work you did for him, and we're really invested in it. He is the bad guy, here, and your not putting up with it is another step away from your former doormat status."
"It's okay, you're in a shitty situation you never thought you'd be in."
"I think it would be totally fine to sit him down and say, ""I know you love me, but I'm feeling a little insecure right now though because I know you used to have a crush on her. Are we okay? I really just need you to reassure me your feelings for her are in the past, and that will help me stop worrying. I would like to get to know her too and am hoping we will all be friends."" Be open to hearing his reassurances and trusting that you two are committed. Assume the best about him and your relationship. 

Now, if he gets weird, defensive, or starts crossing boundaries, you will have to reassess but until then, be confident in the relationship the two of you have built together. Good luck, OP!"
"Yeah but how do you know after only 3-4 weeks (or even less, considering that OP has met the boy 7-8 times in the past month alone) that someone is going to play a role in your life? When you start dating someone, you don't really know them at all, unless you were good friends prior to dating. Even in that case, you can't guarantee that you're romantically compatible just because you're compatible as friends. It's irresponsible to introduce your child to a new partner early on because there's no way of knowing if the relationship is going to work out."
"Man honestly fuck your ""best friend,"" He just went behind your back and royally screwed up any friendship/relationship you all have together with his family. This is not something a friend does let alone someone you call a best friend. Give Karen a call, go over to her and fix this. Ignore John and whatever he says, he's lying and a complete asshole. "
"That's an interesting idea about not surprising her on her wedding day. 

Maybe it would be better to inform her about the car soon, get it to her a few weeks before the wedding so she can feel comfortable in it and show it off to the guests. "
"Yeah I never really saw OP just say outright ""I don't want us to see each other anymore,"" just vague ""I need space"" which some people (like this guy) who just don't want to take a hint will be able to interpret into something else.

"So if I understand this correctly, the last communication you had *directly* from Patricia was her essentially telling you that your mutual friendship was over and not to contact her again? all this other stuff has been filtered through a mutual friend? This is some tweener bullshit right here (on Patricia's part). Continue to ignore everything. Even if she does come back and try to rekindle the friendship, I *strongly* urge you to think twice about ever trusting her again. "
"You can call this other girl, but likely she saw what happened, worried for you, and when she was relatively certain your gf didn't see, slipped you her number because she wants to help you out of an abusive relationship.

It's common for abusers to hold onto these things to keep control of you, if they're already out of his reach you'll have an easier time getting away."
"I feel like you're not understanding what everyone is saying. This isn't about your body, it's about him being predatory and the ensuing power imbalance. At 22, he was about to graduate college, if he hadn't already, and he was dating someone who had 2 years left in their high school career?

Its one thing to be ""stuck on the ages"" when one of you is 54 and one of you is 60. You're at the same life stage by that point. He was two full life stages in front of you...and instead of dating someone his own age, he went after a high schooler? I don't know if you have siblings, but how would you feel if your high school sibling was dating a college graduate?"
"Or if you wanna be brutal, ""Evan get your shit together. Now is when you decide if you wanna be the awesome guy I know you're capable of or a sad sack rotting in his parents basement. You don't have to go to college, but you gotta fucking do something."""
It's what we've agreed. I think it would be hard to manage if it was much less than 2 years. 
OP thought she was consenting to a sex act she was comfortable with. If she had of know what he was about to do she would have never got into the shower with him. Stop twisting this to blame her. Her being ok with a blowjob in no way justifies him pissing in her face without asking her beforehand ffs
"Also make sure you get tested! If cheating is suspected, you should always get tested."
"I'm just going to address one thing, sorry I'm not hitting every point.

Don't let your family shame you into thinking sex is wrong. Sex is a personal thing and as long as all parties are able to give informed consent and nobody is being unduly harmed (outside of any possible kinks), it should be kept personal. Just remember to practice safe sex.

Humans are sexual beings. Don't let yourself be shamed for enjoying something which is natural. (edit: natural AND acceptable)"

"Restrict her from seeing pictures of your social life with your friends and other SIL so that you're not rubbing her face in your friendships, and that's the end of your responsibility to her.  "
"Personally I'd ask her, if you came from a culture where marrying siblings was allowed, would she be upset if she were hanging out with her brother and you implied they were fucking? Or if she's interested in all her cousins?

I mean, I'd still nope out because it's pretty obvious she won't trust you two but I'm just a curious dick like that sometimes."
This comment is mean but I'm laughing 😂 thank you 🖍
I'm confused.  What's the issue here?
"People are trying to explain to you that you can't get her to realize the danger. You have communicated in a reasonable way and the message wasn't received, your part in this is done now. The only way for her to realize it is if she has a close call, or if something happens and it's too late. Either way, you are obsessing about something you 100% cannot control.

I used to obsess about someone in my family making really awful, life-ruining decisions. My therapist at the time helped me to accept that everyone is on their own path and they are going to make their own mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes are potentially going to seriously ruin their lives. You still can't stop it or control it, because everyone has agency to make their own decisions no matter how much input you give them. 

This isn't a ""fuck you"" attitude as you referenced in another comment. It's accepting a simple fact of life so that your thoughts aren't consumed by things out of your control. In these comments you make it sound like this is getting near the point of obsession for you, it's not healthy *because* there is no solution. You are trying to find a solution where there isn't one *at all*."
"WTF? What a fucking jump. He never said she was number 2, just that he views the relationship differently, as any normal sane human being would.

OP said he treats his mom ""with more respect"", did he ACTUALLY say that word. Or did he say ""Of course I value my moms opinion on such subject matter"" or the like. Who has more life experience? Who knows him better?

Anyone woman who tries to make a guy decide whether his mom is #1 or #2 is missing the point. I would dump OP in a second."
"This line bothered me, too. It sounds like this woman prides herself on speaking her mind. So even if this particular comment/incident blows over peacefully, she will probably speak her mind again about something else. If your boyfriend is always going to brush aside your feelings by saying ""she doesn't mean bad,"" then you're going to have a tough time. "

"Tim was inappropriate.  Buying your underage employee a drink is a no no on so many levels.  Hugging your employee is also inappropriate 90% of the time.

It certainly sounds like he was being flirtatious.  Has he ever made you feel uncomfortable at work?  

If he hasn't, I'd give him a one time pass.  There is a slim chance he was just drunk and friendly and didn't realize how it came off.

If he has, it sounds like sexual harassment.  Start keeping records, and report it to his boss.  "
"If this occurred in your household, do you think a big focus of your life would be to bring your husband back into your faith?  Because that could be an additional problem for him... though I know your opinion is not her opinion.  I just think that could be come something stressful to deal with."
"This!!! OP!!! Pay attention to this post.   Roll with it and joke about it yourself.   It will blow over eventually  either way,  but this way will make it boring a lot quicker.   They will see it doesn't bother you and move on.   I promise it doesn't seem like this,  but in ten years,  you'll look back at this event and laugh about it with your friends.   It WILL blow over.    If you make it not a big deal,  it will blow over a lot more quickly than if you ignore it or try to get administration involved.    

Although if it does escalate to where you can't handle it,  by all means,  tell a parent, reached teacher,  or counselor about it. Don't take on more than you can handle,  but honestly,  short of that,   rolling with it and making it a joke is your best plan of action.   "
"&gt; It felt like she just wanted her lie to be reality.

I think you're right. She probably really loved imagining being pregnant and being there for your sister. She probably felt incredibly happy being seen as her older brother's cool girlfriend guiding her into womanhood. Then imagining herself having a baby with the man she loves? Heaven for her, getting to see her future like that, even if just a dream. Think of it like her getting to live a dream in real life. It's hard to explain that concept to someone who has never had cross-gender thoughts. 

I do empathize with you for how she could never find the right way or time to tell you. It must be very painful to think you know everything important about the person you love, only to find out you don't even know the most basic thing. Literally the most basic thing if you think about it. Of course she would have ideally been honest with you. And of course ideally nature would've gotten it right and she would've just been a girl. Obviously nature isn't fair to everyone and she carries that burden deeply. And she lost her entire family as a result of her 'flaw.' So sad.

My two cents would be to give both of yourselves some time to process what's happened. Don't discount the value of time - maybe take some time apart and see how you feel about each other then. Maybe you'll  realize you can't forgive after all or maybe you'll remember all those awesome things about her. If she apologizes and is genuine, I'd be rooting for you to give her a second chance."

"I had a similar pregnancy. The morning sickness alone was enough to make me really hesitant to have another kid. That's completely disregarding all the other shit that pregnancy brings... I for example developed an autoimmune disease I'll have for the rest of my life from the influx of pregnancy hormones. 

You might have a perfect pregnancy but you might have an awful one... It's a roll of the dice. 

I think this girl is seriously deluded. She has no idea the emotional and physical madness that is pregnancy, and she's going to learn some really, *really* hard lessons if she decides to go through with this. It's a sweet sentiment, but there's a reason why it's strongly recommended (and in my country, mandatory) to birth at least one child first.

"Honestly, OP, this isn't your secret to keep -- unless you want to, and it sounds like you do.

So don't tell your dad. Continue to have an estranged relationship with him, and be there for your sister as she works out whatever feelings she now has knowing she's the daughter of a different man.

As for romantic relationships, there's no need to mention any of this to a woman you're dating. If you bring her home to meet family and are at the point where you're totally committed then you can figure out how to share this information, if you want to. At some point I would tell your future wife, in case of medical issues down the line.

Your mother and uncle's infidelity isn't your problem -- it's theirs -- so don't make it yours. But I'd encourage you to support your sister if she decides to tell your father."

"Couldn't have said it better myself! I work in child welfare and a lot of people have the misconception that (most) teenagers in foster care don't want to be adopted because they know who their ""real"" family is and that by the time they become a teenager, they're already ""broken"" and will have so many issues it's not even worth giving them a chance. 

My best advice is to be open with them about your fears, because those fears can often manifest into something that looks entirely different. It's going to be a big transition for all of you, and while I know you're excited to be adopted, you can expect some bumps along the way. That's the way it goes with any type of blended family and why open communication is so important.

"I think it's really not too to ask to expect an SO or even a good friend putting you into that type of social situation to make an effort to make you comfortable. You don't say what culture they were raised in, but it's a pretty universal thing to know that if a person speaks language A and B and the rest of you speak language B and C, it makes the most sense to speak language B. If it's more stilted and formal for them, so what? If they're kind people (and better yet, people who have been prepped in advance for meeting you) then they'll make the effort. 

Your boyfriend didn't have to babysit you, he just needed to identify some of the friendlier people in the group and say (in language B) that you're still learning and introduce you to them with a few details so you can get a conversation flowing. Being around so many native speakers could have been a rich opportunity for you to improve your language skills and be accepted into his community, but he doesn't seem to be willing to do any of the social and emotional labour in this intercultural relationship.

Sorry, this isn't a situation where he's unaware of how bad his behavior is and if you could bring about an ""Aha!"" moment he would realize it and change. He knows what he's doing, and he feels justified. The only way he can change is if he does some serious, deep work on himself, rooting out his issues, with professional help. And you're not going to get him to do that by begging, pleading, or hoping. That sort of profound change is very rare and has to be entirely self-motivated. Given that he's currently actively sabotaging the help he's getting from his therapist, you can rule out that slim possibility.

It might be hard for a lot of us to understand, but this scenario is one of the worst nightmares of people who truly believe that non-believers are doomed to eternal damnation."
Okay again you aren't answering the question. Have you had the conversation about you two *specifically* getting married? Not that she wants marriage period. 
"Honestly, some people just really can't deal with others having different diets to them. I'm dairy intolerant and it's almost hard to believe how many people try to ""test"" me by sneaking in milk, cheese, etc into my foods. Blatantly lying about the contents of a meal. I don't know why people get so worked up about it but they do. I find it really hard to trust things strangers make for me now. "
Yeah. She sounds like a nasty person who just isn't worth being around.

"Yeah OP, just tell your girlfriend she needs therapy. There's no way that comment will be misconstrued as anything but loving encouragement. "
"It's possible, but unlikely that she entered your room to writhe around on you until you came, and then spent considerable effort bragging about her results, and that your automatic sexual response was a total accident. But like. What on earth were her motives in doing that to you, if not to engineer some kind of sexual humiliation for you? She's a cruel, hurtful, disgusting person."
I'm at work and I'm like spitting mad. I've never hated a poster this much before. 
"&gt; I'm not a fan of public proposals, I think it's embarassing and the pressure is awful. We live in LA and we both have very busy lives, so in my mind, taking her to a lovely small town in the South where we had nature and the sound of waves crashing and just getting away from the city life was a good thing. I didn't hired any photographers because it wasn't worth it, I thought about taking her to a different country and doing it in beautiful places afterwards. The proposal itself was just about marrying her. Being with her. And I DID bought her the ring she wanted.
&gt; 

Just think about the fact that you're being downvoted into oblivion and reread the comments here. Until you both learn to compromise, you are too immature to be married/engaged."
"yea they must've just been naive enough to think it would work. 

not sure how well you know this friend, if you didn't explain well that most of the trip would be nature oriented, or something else, but it sounds like there was  miscommunication somewhere. 

I'd pay for him to gtfo. i visited several parks &amp; states with my SO, cant even imagine trying to share a room with a 3rd wheel, let alone the other stuff. "
I so wish I could have my teenaged body back for a long weekend. 
"Right, it's not the main part of the relationship, to you. But it seems to be a big part for her. This is one of those big issues that you can't really compromise or work out, since there's not any middle ground - like having kids/not having kids, strict religion/atheism, poly/not poly. One of you is going to be unhappy with whatever ends up happening, especially since you've said that neither of you would be ok with her going outside the relationship. 

It seems to me as though you're basically looking for ways to make her okay with you not having or wanting sex with her, which is to say, you getting your way and her not getting hers in terms of this issue. That's pretty unfair to her, since for most people who aren't asexual, having sex in a romantic relationship is a crucial part of that relationship."
"Well it's not like these weddings are for your close mutual friends or your boyfriend's family who invited only your boyfriend and not you. They're people you've never met or acquaintances. There is a 0% chance they were excluding you on purpose, if they even knew you were dating. They were focusing on who they wanted at the wedding, not who to exclude.

I recently went to a wedding of my childhood friend and didn't get a plus one. I've been with my boyfriend for 3+ years and we were both fine with it because my friend wanted a smaller wedding and has never met my boyfriend. It wasn't a personal dig against the validity of our relationship, it was just logistics. Think about it like that."

"If that were true, he would have asked first so that he could make SURE you weren't discomforted. He didn't bother because your feelings about being pissed on weren't as important to him as the opportunity to piss on you was.

"&gt;We have 3 teenaged boys ( 17, 16 and 14) who are very full of energy. They love to do anything that involves being physical (sports, and working out) and I would of thought that would of supressed some of their hormones, but they still have a horrible tendacy to fight.

I don't think this is about energy, I think it's more about the fact that they don't know how to handle anger and conflict appropriately. In my view that's what you need to work on with them. You might need to get some proper expert help on that. "
"Well, it is weird, and he has done it several times. It might be that he has figured out they are away on vacation and is setting up to rob them. I say call the cops. "
And this is the person you love and respect and admire? You've got bigger issues than insurance rates... 
"Her anxiety is not your problem. Like the others have said: talk to her.

Oh, and I'm not sure if you did this already or not, but did you tell your employee that it was your girlfriend who did it, and not you? If you haven't done so, you should, even if you've already gotten fired. Write an apology saying how you had no idea and this has taught you to be more careful about who can access your accounts, etc."
"This is exactly my thought every time I see one of those types of comments. More often than not, the posts are in reference to something/someone that was totally inconsiderate. Offering the suggestion to consider the values one would look for in a partner seems quite reasonable to me..."
"I'll google this, thank you. "
"To add to this point, it's also worth considering how this arrangement affects OP's future relationships. At this point is he expected to tell *his* future partners that he never had sex with his best friend? Either you are forced to live in the same lie she has constructed, or you now not only have to tell your future significant others that you slept with your best friend, but also warn them that your best friend's fiancee/husband can NEVER KNOW ABOUT IT. Your future SO may or may not be comfortable with you being complicit in keeping those kinds of secrets, but either way it adds a layer of discomfort to an already likely uncomfortable talk. And if I were your SO (and a girl, I guess, but whatever, if we were gay together I'd feel the same way) in that situation, a pretty immediate question/concern would be why your best friend didn't want to tell her fiancee? Is it because you guys were still doing things? Is she hiding it because her feelings for you are more than platonic and she doesn't want to have to admit that to her fiancee? It certainly wouldn't help me feel more comfortable in the relationship, at any rate. Even if you did nothing wrong, any kind of intentional deceit is likely going to create questions and insecurities.

I'm with a girl right now who is still good friends with several people she has slept with, but vitally I know about them, and so do their significant others know about my girlfriend, and if anything knowing she's comfortable talking to me about those things BUILDS trust. Everything is out in the open, and I believe she will tell me things even if they're potentially hurtful to me.

Like it or not, your best friend's decision to hide this information from her fiancee does have potential impacts on you, and it's worth really looking at what those might be."
She'll probably learn to not display this behavior on the first date
"I thought his ""you should"" was in response to her saying ""I'd never do it again."" 

Either way, they both believe they're right, and this isn't exactly a situation that allows for compromise (We'll only spank our kids on Wednesdays!)"
"Which is why we let 14 year olds smoke, drink, drive and have sex with adults..."

"The lying about the military is jerky, but not creepy. Lots of people lie about stuff like that to make themselves look cool. The empty building with the fake labels is creepy as fuck. Make sure a bunch of people know where you are, and send them pics of Sal."
"Because sometimes people really can get over their feelings for someone. I assume ""actively crushing on him and trying to get with him"" would be treated a lot differently than ""liked him a few years before his current relationship"" or whatever. "
"He should have enough self-respect and respect for you that he doesn't let that shit slide. You're *his* gf. Disrespecting you is disrespecting him, and vice versa. 

Don't want to make any rude assumptions, but if he's generally a spineless loser who won't put people in there place, maybe there's someone better for you. 

&gt;I'm also under the suspicion that he's not physically attracted to me and that might be the reason why he didn't say anything when his friend basically called me ugly.

1) Highly doubt that's true. Guy game involves making the girl think you're less into her than you really are. You're likely overthinking it. 

2) If it is true, still doesn't excuse not standing up for someone you should unassumingly care about. Spineless and not caring? Not good bf material.

"
"Something definitely feels off, and I wondered if Sal could be running some sort of scam, rather than planning a murder. "
"&gt; I don't think I'm her favourite at all. She's constantly trying to reach out and do ""sister"" things

How can you type that and not see that you obviously are someone who is massively important to her? Where is the disconnect?

&gt;When we first met, we were both outsiders together and got along swimmingly but then she changed and took my family with her.

You mean when she wasn't being horrifically abused anymore? You really seem like you just want her to wallow in sorrow just so you can feel better about yourself. 

&gt;She's so overly appreciative of every little thing my parents do for her, of course they adore her

They likely saved her life. Is she suppose to pout in a corner just because you don't want to be thankful for anything in your life?

&gt; I'm sure he'd never go camping in a million years if I asked him but supposedly they had oh just the best time.

""Supposedly."" You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. She wants to go do things with him and interact. You don't. They had a good time because they actually made the effort to, instead of isolating themselves and blaming everyone else for it. "
"They can't arrest you for adults bringing drugs around you, however they can arrest the adults for that. Call the police "

"300 out of 1300 is a lot, but we save primarily for emergencies like this. That's the point. I would try to bargain; in exchange he can spend 300 at a future time when we have more savings on a hobby. A video game or something? It's clear he doesn't care about these plants, but if you give him some incentive, then he might. Also, check the balance on the account to double check the money is still there. Just in case."
"Neo-pagan of many years here. I'm all about chakras and shit. BUT... There is a thing that people do when they are new to alternative or new age spirituality. They tend to go a bit overboard in their enthusiasm sometimes, often alienating their non-believing family and friends. It's just a phase. When the dust settles, at best, you take what truly works and dismiss what doesn't and try not to bother those who don't get it. You don't get it, and you won't. They can't see that yet. If they aren't harming themselves or others and are finding a positive benefit in these beliefs/practices... Is it really so bad? Be patient, and let them ride it out. Arguing reason doesn't really work, because they're feeling something that you don't have the spiritual fluidity to fully grasp. And that's okay. You don't have to and likely have no need to. Let them have this. They've bought the ticket. Let them take the ride. They may feel differently once they've had some time to reflect on their experiences. They're noobs. Noobs do that. It's part of the process. "
"Your boyfriend has phimosis, it's an issue that some intact guys have where the foreskin is tight and will not retract. The best thing for him to do is see his doctor for steroid cream and then start manual stretching so it can move freely. There are many sites out there with direction on how to do it. "
"I mean what does she want them for?

I got bridal boudoir photos taken but other than the female photographer the only one who saw them was my husband. Well, that's not strictly true; my best friend helped me pick among some poses for prints but I never posted them online or anything.

Does she want them for you?"
By you're terrible logic then because he watches porn you should be able to do porn without him having a problem with it too? See how dumb that sounds? Not to mention he has probably zero chance of ever being with whatever fictional gamer girl. While if you were to take and post pictures such as that the chance of you actually meeting dozens if not hundreds of guys is very real possibility.
"The only time I've had a ""break"" was it was going to be a break-up but we decided to be ""on break to talk about and fix what caused us to break up"" 

Less than a week after deciding it would be ""just a break and not a break-up"" he was in a relationship with someone else without even having the decency to let me know he had started a new relationship and that the ""break"" was now a ""break-up"". I had to ask him if that's what it was and he confirmed it. He then unfriended me from everything and quit talking to me.

He came back when their relationship failed (Why it failed? I'll never know) which lead to about a year of on-off-but-never-official relationship that was horribly destructive for both of us.

So I may be biased but I think you either stay in the relationship or break-up. ""taking a break"" invites all kinds of problems into your life."
"Your boyfriend is a liar, seems like that's pretty consistent way for him to deal with you so yeah, he's probably not going to stop, you're probably never going to trust the guy, right?"
"&gt; Yeah, breaks are bullshit. 

Depends on circumstances.  When my wife and I were dating, it was SUPER long distance (as in countries separated by an ocean).  I felt like I was holding her back from being happy (since we weren't able to go out together with friends and socialize at all) so I requested a break.  We still spoke occasionally and kept up on the goings on here and there.  Once I realized that I didn't want to be without her anymore, I told her that if she were confident that her and I could make it work, I wanted to end the break and I wanted us to be together any way or shape possible.  We dated a few years, spending several weeks together during summer and Christmas.  At midnight on a New Years Eve/Day, I proposed at our friend's party, in front of everyone.  She said yes.  We proceeded with the painstakingly long K-1 Visa process, and in August 2010, we got married.  In April 2015, we had our first child.  I am more in love with her every day and the ""break"" is what made me realize that she was exactly what I needed in my life.  I did not do it to ""bang"" anyone else, nor did I.  I did it to find myself and let us find out if we wanted to pursue a relationship because ours was not conventional.  LDRs are hard enough, but LDRs with immigration involved can be soul crushing, so we had to be sure it's what we both wanted."
"Out of interest, why all the couples counselling when you describe a great relationship until he was careless with the puppy?

The puppy only died 3 weeks ago and it's ambiguous whether OP is describing how often they will go or how often they were already going.
"&gt; They said there can be negative connotations and he didn't need to deal with it as he lost his accent long ago.

OP is not understanding the pain of South Africa; your boyfriend is keeping this from you for a reason. Language is thought and identity, and while you ""want to learn some words"" which is cool, it's probably much deeper for him.

Be careful here, he didn't keep this from you for no reason..."
"Just want to support this idea. You and your family come first now. You have your own family now. I just agree with where I feel your mind is leaning. Save the money for your wedding. Get pregnant!! Have your first born be the flower girl or ring holder! And don't feel like you need to get married before kids. I don't know if your in Anerica or not but we discovered after quickly getting married once we found out we were pregnant that it would have been better to not get married because of all the benefits ""single"" mothers get. Anyway, point is, you need to start prioritizing things in your life differently. Growing up, your parents and siblings were the most important people in your life. But now, the most important people are you, your (future) husband, and your (future) kids. I think you should do exactly what this comment suggested. Get refunds on everything you can and put all that money towards your own wedding and your life. If asked, tell them something came up in your life that just depleted any money you had to go to this. Say you literally do not have the money to pay for it. If they are so well off and having you there is so important to them, THEY will pay to have their sister/daughter at the wedding. I mean shit, I wanted my maid of honor to come so bad I paid for her dress and to have her come to it more than 600 miles away. She was broke as a joke and I knew if I wanted her there, I had to make it happen. I knew she would go if she could and she wanted to go, but she just simply could not afford it. So I made sure she came. That's what you do when someone is important to you and you want them at an important event. If they don't, then you know how important you are to him and then shouldn't feel bad about burdening your own life to attend something that means nothing"

How often do we get actual lawyers responding to such posts? Almost never. Everyone upvote this guy so OP knows what's up and can tell his girlfriend's manipulative father to shove it. 
"Yep, this is weird to me. I have no biological children, but do have a stepdaughter. I use that term out of respect for her mother, who is living and active in raising her, but she is 100 percent family to me, and would always be, even if I divorced her father. I don't understand how one could take care of a child for 14 years and then just disconnect."
Tell her straight up that she's too much trouble to hang out with and you have no interest in being a grown woman's baby sitter. 
"Man, that destroyed electronics one was nuts. Dude told his GF ONCE that he's not mad at her for accidentally dropping his laptop and breaking it, finished by saying the look of worry on her face was actually kind of cute...so she decided to remain 'cute' but continuously breaking all of his shit on 'accident'. Crazy."
"People drive to things together all the time. It's called carpooling. It doesn't make things a date.

It would be pretty unreasonable for him to ask that  especially since budgets are clearly tight when they won't pay up the 30 some dollars to split the cost of gas.

Whenever we did road trips, it was always that the driver doesn't pay any gas because his portion of the trip will be paid with the depreciation, wear and tear, tire wear, etc."
This guy just keeps proving your point. And I'm like o_O
"Here's what you did right: 

-- You set a firm limit in clear language 

-- You explained why, making her aware of the cat's point of view so that she learns how to see the cat as a living thing and not just a doll

-- You kept the cat from getting hurt 

-- You said something positive: that she could try again later 

Well, that's about it. I'm not seeing a downside here. You did well. "
"You saying ""99% of the time it works out"" means that you admit that you are currently in the 1%, admitting that being you walked all over is not going to work out for long.

"Out of curiosity, do you do all of these things because he just won't? Or he finds ways to get out of them? Or do you do all of it by choice and he just lets you?

When really all I needed to do was ask him to take some of the load, and he does. "

"&gt;My boyfriend says his mom always speaks her mind and she doesn't mean bad she just gave her opinion.

This is SUCH bullshit. This is the kind of reasoning that assholes use when they say something particularly offensive, ""I was just being honest."" So if honesty is important to her, she would be OK if you walked into her house and said ""Wow, this place is a dump. You have terrible taste. You should really get rid of all this trash and get someone qualified to decorate it for you. I don't mean anything bad, just offering my opinion."" I'm sure that would go over well, right?

Honestly, it almost doesn't even matter if it's a racist thing. It's definitely an asshole thing. Your boyfriend is obviously trained to put his mom and her opinions first. Maybe he can get over it, but that doesn't mean that you have to put up with any shit from her."

All she could do was laugh (probably secretly raging haha). 

I usually read them, get distracted and forget about them. It really is a bad habit and I have made strides in getting better myself. But text-based communication is so easily to forget about during the work hour, with all the emails, and general reading going on."
"After a 6 year traumatic relationship she slept with 11 guys in less then a year. She slept with 6 guys while realizing she isn't over him. It's not a vent, it's a newly found coping mechanism. It's not unreasonable to predict it happening when things get rough."
I was 19 once. Managed to get through it without getting my boyfriend fired from his job.
"Yeah, he's pointing out your hypocrisy. Heaven forbid he have a friendly conversation with someone. 

Just because he is engaged in conversation with a women that makes you feel threatened? What exactly was he saying that makes you refer to it as flirting?

Maybe his actions aren't really as bad as you're saying. Maybe you just realize that you are on thin ice and it's making you incredibly insecure and worried (which you should be). So now.. The security of your relationship is gone (since you ruined it by cheating) and because you don't feel secure anymore you are on the lookout for any perceived threats. 

You see that he is easily able to strike up a friendly conversation with a woman and you realize that he probably wouldn't have any problem finding someone else (someone better than doesn't cheat on him). So of course that makes you break down into tears.

I think you realize that you no longer have the power or influence over him that you used to. The image in his head of you as this amazing girlfriend has been shattered by your infidelity. He no longer sees you with rose colored glasses and that scares the shit out of you. "
"I'd wager that your mother's childhood wasn't a bed of roses.

Picture this, OP. Imagine that when you had recitals, your parents laughed at your enthusiasm and hard work and said it was worthless. Imagine that, when you struggled academically, they called you stupid, or a moron, or useless, instead of getting you a tutor. If they called you ugly, a disease, that you were a waste.

That weird feeling you get, where you felt two inches tall and so alone? That drives a body to run away and to emotionally kill all ties. And I will bet you a doughnut that's what happened. They bypassed your mother and went for her weakpoint- you.

Talk to your mother. Give her time. Tell her you'll love her no matter what. And brace yourself for the response."
"If your girlfriend wanted an extravagant, over-the-top proposal and is being a princess throwing a fit because she didn't get it, you're dodging a huge bullet.

But if your girlfriend isn't some unreasonable snob, and you actually want an unbiased opinion about your proposal, you might want to describe what you did more precisely.  I mean, all I got was that you were in a small town in the South and you could hear the ocean.  Could have been really nice.  Or you could have just popped the question at a gas station near the beach after eating at Waffle House.  "
"I don't think he's yet ready for this kind of advice. 


OP has *five* kids already and a happy loving family. He  may not be willing/interested to take on another daughter (other than what he owes on a child support level). And let's be honest, paying for 6 kids is unlikely to bring his marriage closer together than ever before

In fact, the only reason he is finding out is because this woman needs *money*. For what? Apparently medical issues, but we don't really know. That should be sorted before relationships are formed, as nothing harms more than money issues. 

I'm not saying it's all doom and gloom. I'm just saying that it is way too soon to worry about this step. It's just too soon for OP to be burdened with the ""how much does she hate me?"" type of thinking. 

Especially because OP is not obligated to bring this girl into his life - and *it wouldn't be unfair of him if he didn't*. He may be obligated to pay, and that is all. It is down to the mother to deal with the consequences of her actions. "

In the UK, Cruse are a nationwide organisation that help with bereavement. They have trained bereavement volunteers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as a helpline you can ring to find what help you can access. Have you taken a look at their website (unable to link it on here)?

I found a website called The Mix, which says:

""Our telephone counselling service is suitable for you if you are under 25 and are looking for short-term help with your mental health and emotional wellbeing.

Counselling sessions could help with issues such as:

&gt;A bereavement (death) or relationship breakdown

Please note that our service is not suitable for you if you are already receiving counselling from another therapist, though if you are on a waiting list for treatment you can still access our service.

Let us know your phone number, if it is ok to leave a voicemail and a convenient range of time frames for the counsellor to call you back between Monday to Friday from 9am-7pm (and your age, location, first name if we don’t have this already).""

Maybe this organisation could help you? The local Citizens' Advice Bureau may also be able to direct you to more locally-based counselling organisations.

I wish you the best of luck."
Forget about your wife. I think your son deserves more concern. If the divorce is acrimonious and his lifestyle takes a hit he will 100% blame himself for ruining his family and his own life. Don't forget him in the bigger scheme of things and don't use him to fight your battles. Also don't ask him to take sides and don't abandon him if he lashes out. Just think of him when you're out dating so you spend the same amount  of time with him as you did before (or more since he's turning into an adult soon and needs more guidance). Just don't forget you're a parent when you're living it up as a bachelor.
I'm not worried about my wife but my sister (a lawyer) is executor of my estate so I'm covered. Thanks.
"Yeah, but it sounds better, and that seems to be all OP's friends and family cares about "

A person who is compulsively lying doesn't have to lie about everything -- it wouldn't even work.  ""Hi, my name ISN'T /u/Hekili808.  The sky is brown.  Fire is cold!""  Lying about everything would undermine the lies that matter to them.

People here really enjoy countering anything that sounds remotely like a diagnosis with their best House, MD impression.  I'm not saying that /r/relationships should diagnose anything, but /u/panic_bread was dead on with regard to the lying and how it impacts a relationship."

"But your comment doesn't have any advice- what are OP's options? Seriously? She already warned her neighbor. She can continue to push it but that's just going to create tension. Some people in the country want to have that ""we need to look out for each other"" relationship- and some people want to be left the fuck alone. 

So unless OP wants to harass her neighbor about this then there's literally nothing she can do except keep to herself. "

"From what I have seen guys and girls think about this differently. As a guy, I would MUCH rather you have had a three-month relationship with someone that didn't out than sleep with a lot of random guys. A similar situation to yours happened to my friend and he said the same thing to her when they were getting back together and she was worried about the relationship she had been in. 

In general, guys care about sexual partners and women care about emotional relationships. While this isn't true is all contexts this is more often than not the case.

Let us know how things turn out."
"You could play offense. When someone asks what you do say something like ""I hesitate to tell people what I do for a living because many people try to take advantage of it.

"He's a shitty dad yes, but that's his kid too.

"""Look, don't touch"" is a perfectly acceptable relationship boundary. Her problem is that they didn't discuss these boundaries at all. That is on both of them. It was a glaring hole in their communication, which they will hopefully fix.

It's not prudish to have reasonable boundaries, nor is it possessive to not want someone to touch half naked people while in a relationship with you. "
"You two are in the wrong, it is not okay to do anything with her child that she is uncomfortable with. In fact, I think she is very mature and responsible for breaking up with the boyfriend who crossed a line when it comes to her child."

In the original post OP mentioned that Gwen and the almost-bf were going to the same college
"Far out man. What would your wife's reaction be if she read this post? Wouldn't be great I don't think. You guys are subtly flirting, just enough to convince yourselves you haven't crossed a boundary just yet. You both know it and you both like it. So how far does it go before it's too far? Maybe tip toeing the boundary is the best part? Cmon man. Put a big amount of distance between you and this girl, as much as your job will allow. Keep it strictly professional. That or keep up with what you know you're doing until someone gets hurt."
"One of the couples needs to take one for the team and add Nick as a threesome :-)

You know what's crass? Marrying a 23 year old when you're 45 with 2 kids.
"It isn't bad that you don't feel the need to be paid for helping someone out.  However you are currently collecting benefits because you don't have a means of supporting yourself and are doing a job that almost everyone pays for.   Now I can see you wanting to babysit as stress relief just fun time with a kid,  I don't have any problem with that.  However I'd still say in most circumstances I'd feel the other family is taking advantage of you.  I'd never not pay my babysitter, and if she was unemployed I'd feel even worse by not paying.  "
"OP, I completely see your viewpoint, a lie is a lie. 

But I want to tag on to this comment because you've mentioned several times that you would not have had a problem if she had come clean much earlier in the relationship. Plus, all these points about your GF's really shitty experience in life and the murder rate for trans women last me to the conclusion that self preservation is possibly the *ONLY* exception I might make to this lie being not as egregious as it might otherwise have been. 

I would like to encourage you to talk to her about it some more, to try to truly understand what she lived through to make her so desperately need to protect herself from those who claimed to love her. This might involve some couples counseling, or you participating in her counseling, to learn about the situation... 

Maybe the lie is still too big to overcome... But maybe you'll discover that you can also appreciate the difficult situation she found herself in, and the lie will be more understandable and forgivable. Isn't that worth finding out?"

"It would have been one thing if you went into the relationship knowing she basically got naked in front of strangers and then suddenly expected her to change, or you discussed her camming first, but her up and deciding to do it knowing you wouldn't be okay with it because she'd rather go out and drink then get a part time job is pretty selfish and disrespectful to you.
I mean, camgirls are in the business of selling sex, and i think her guilt tripping you about it and acting like you're the one making nothing into a big deal is pretty shitty of her.
I'd say it's a dealbreaker or at least it would be for me.

"I think you guys are missing out on the wording here. Punkpixz asked ""is that what you want"" and OP responded ""it's what we agreed"". Notice WANT vs. AGREE.

"I wonder if your company is always on the verge of laying someone off. No one else would apply to be a ""float"" *and* stick to that float position for a long time. Training new employees costs money, overtime costs money and you can pick up the slack using straight time. 

I've worked for companies in a similar position. I applied to temp positions because I had travel plans bought and paid for five months out. They were happy to have me be gone for a while so they didn't have to pay me, and welcomed me back after my travels because I was trained and familiar. Eventually everyone was laid off. "
"Correct. Save the big speech for the rehearsal IMO. I work in the wedding industry and the weddings where they have 6 people who all give an 8 minute speech suuuuuck.

"You didn't do anything wrong. If she didn't want gender specific gifts for her kids she should've communicated that to you beforehand. Just remember this for the future, maybe? There are a lot of gender neutral gifts out there - like stuffed animals, puzzles, and colouring books :)

You seem like a great uncle. You've got nothing to feel badly about.

Edit: ""she should've communicated that to you *beforehand*."""
"I think you're more caught up in the gender roles than she is. She got her boyfriend a job because someone in her industry mentioned specifically needing a helping hand and she presented her boyfriend without him being present or knowing afterward. He was given the job without even an interview, suggesting *there were absolutely zero other viable choices besides him.* This goes to prove that her recommendation legitimately did give him the job as it is something that would not have occurred had she not suggested her BF, talked him up (how strong and fit he is as he is part of construction) and facilitated contact between the two. It is her industry, not his.

Doing this without any kind of thank you or appreciation would be extremely frustrating, hurtful, and I would absolutely feel taken advantage of if I were in that situation. Lastly, buying someone things in order to express appreciation isn't the same as gender roles. In the beginning OP was paying for living expenses, additional food costs, etc. from her SO going to stay at her house and normally he would repay her by taking her out. Now things were evened out once they had similar jobs and they both went dutch on payment, however once he received a significant raise that more than doubled his income, she perhaps thought it would flip again. From her treating him, to equality, then to him treating her as a way to work out the financial disparity.

But no. No thank you. No gratefulness. No signs of appreciation. No cute dinner or something to express his love once he has the finances. Just selfishness, probably him spending his money on drugs and the things he prioritizes. No, it isn't a requirement to give gifts or be a polite, considerate and appreciative person but the fact that she went out of her way without even a thank you goes to show how little he cares about her.

 Lastly, I try to treat my SO all the time while we are out to dinner if I can afford it and he does too. I buy cute lingerie for him to see and I also will buy HQ food items and bake him things. My SO will take me out to dinner, get me chocolates while he's out, and also takes me to his beach house and drives me places. We are both kinda struggling college students although he has a solid, higher income and even when we can't express our love through gifts it's also done through acts of service (i.e. filling up car w/ gas, giving my SO a brand new $500 AC, etc.), physical expressions (snuggles, hugs, kisses, hand holding) and verbal reassurances (ily bb, you're the best, I appreciate you, you make me so happy, I miss you). It is not normal to be giving without receiving any of this back except the occasional love you. It just seems very one sided and like she's putting in all this effort and showing how much she loves and cares and he's just not doing anything to nurture and help this relationship grow.

So I think she needs to rethink the relationship because he seems like a crap partner but I don't think she did anything wrong nor that this is a matter of gender roles and equality. "

"Well at the moment it's currently your uncles word against hers, however the undeniable and objective proof of something highly suspicious is the deletion of messages and the 100+ phone calls. 
There is no reason to have that many calls with anyone, even you, in such a short time span. 100 plus calls in 21 days? WTF? To me at the bare minimum she's having an emotional affair.

What you should do? Well to me lying and/or concealing evidence is already a deal breaker way before the emotional affair, then a physical affair because in every relationship lying is the absolute precursor to cheating. 
Think about it for a second. It's impossible to carry on or have an affair without telling a lie to your partner or concealing the truth somehow.

Once this happens, I no longer trust the person, and if I no longer trust you I'm done. Life is way to short to be snooping around and/or paranoid about whether or not your partner is telling the truth. If I feel the need to have to go through your phone or emails or whatever that means I no longer trust you so why bother.
I've lost way too much sleep over that in the past - learned my lesson and never letting it happen again.

It utterly destroys a part of your humanity).  So, my punishment is that I will probably grow old and die, alone, not knowing the joy of a healthy, loving relationship. Maybe when I'm older, and my sex bits stop working...but for now, I should be alone. I take comfort in the fact that the women I hurt are doing so well, and they found loving, kind men.

But I definitely hope you'll point out that you've been under the impression that you've been dating, and that if that's not the case you're going to 1) stop sleeping with him and 2) start seeing other people immediately who aren't going to take 2 years to *ask you out*.

"Go to counseling on your own to see what you want to do. Maybe you will decide you want to work on the marriage. Maybe you will decide you want to divorce. You don't have to decide right now, and there is no right answer - just what's right for you and you may not be able to figure that out for some time. Some people can work past infidelity and some can't. One path or the other isn't better, it just depends on what you need and want. 

Tell your wife you're going to speak with a therapist on your own before you make any decisions and in the meantime, she needs to be 100% transparent and honest with you. I would strongly recommend that she begins therapy too, and if I were you, I would insist she cut all contact with this coworker even if she has to quit that job. Above all, remember your daughter is watching and while you don't have to forgive your wife, you do still have to have a relationship with the mother of your children. Getting professional help will go a long way to ensuring you can keep the emotional fallout of this from landing on them. Good luck, OP. "
"You are not too demanding. He sounds horrid. He's trying to habituate you to a lower and lower standard of love, care and attention so that he can do what he likes and take you for granted.

There is an old story of a farmer who owned a donkey. He thought that feeding the donkey was too expensive, so he started reducing its feed by one stem of hay every day. For a while thr donkey was ok so the farmer thought his plan was a success. He kept reducing the feed until finally the day came when he fed his donkey one stalk of hay. The farmer celebrated. The donkey died thr next day."
"Thats true. But when I hear stories from retail workers or waiters from the US, I am astounished. Where I live, if you break something at the super market you have to pay for it.

"It may not cross your mind that it's for a ring (it whooshed me too originally) but can you honestly say you would have spent it straight on steaks no questions asked?

If my so's dad gave me 1k and told me to spend it on the anniversary for the ages, I would question him a helluva lot first. 1k on steaks, no matter how you dice it, is ridiculous and extremely bad financial judgement. I've been to Michelin starred restaurants and we never racked up the bill to 1k. You literally poop that stuff right back out! 

Honestly if I were the dad I would feel scammed too. Because no one in an adult mindset would actually blow 1k ONLY on food unless they're rich rich."
"Take heart, most people aren't very good at hiding who they are long-term. The problem is we ignore red flags when we're in love. 

Before you get super serious, ask your friends and family what they think of your SO and get to know their friends. The vast majority of the time, you'll get a really good idea who someone is before you marry them."
"Something to consider:  Someone like this (older, divorced, kids) has baggage.  Right now, you're dating him, but as you get more serious, you would possibly end up dealing with not only Chris, but his kids (and their needs), his Ex (with whom there may be some conflict).  Eventually, you'll find yourself wound up in more than just the happy dating this cool older guy relationship.  And that could be awesome or it could be bad.

Another consideration:  Do you want kids of your own?  Because Chris isn't that young.  If the two of you had a child in a few years, then Chris would be around 65 when your child graduated high school.

Take things slowly.  Keep your eyes open for potential issues.  Small problems can be compounded when there are kids involved."
"She's obviously trying to knock you down a few pegs because she knows you're around other women that are attracted to you all the time for your job.

She's trying to lower your self esteem to make you less likely to leave her for one of those women.

It's more indicative of her own insecurity than anything else. This is a super unhealthy way to deal with it, of course.

You obviously shouldn't quit your job to make her feel better, and she's not going to feel better about herself without some help so... You guy probably need couples counseling to acknowledge her worries, that the way she handles them is emotionally abusive to you, and learn new, healthier ways to deal with it. Individual counseling for her to work on her own self esteem and insecurity is needed as well."

"&gt;mental illnes... I've gotten confused about where I was 


Try to see their side: they need to find a balance between on the one hand checking up on you (for example when you seem to be somewhere odd), and on the other hand being TOO invasive.

It must be very hard (?impossible) for them to find a middle way

Also they may be checking your documents because they dont believe you can manage them on your own. But then  they should ask. Maybe get a locked box for them"

Women have to put up with catcalling and sleaze on a daily basis, to include from complete strangers on the street. I bet if you asked your GF about it she'd have a ton of stories. Sometimes it gets scary, especially with guys who don't take no for an answer. Everything you have to put up with, I guarantee she's been through a LOT worse.

I would leave the work element alone for a bit, you've been pushing him and it's having a negative response.

"I played football(American) for 11 years, no one said they had a ""concussion"" unless you were literally knocked unconscious, even then most people didn't talk about it, the atmosphere of the culture is that unless you get knocked out you should shake it off because you just got your ""bell rung"" a little. I was knocked unconscious in a game  trying to leap over the line to score a 1 yard touchdown and a linebacker and me went head to head with the crowns of our helmets and I didn't even miss a play, one of the players on my team picked me up off the ground, they all started to tell me to wake up so we could run another play, I woke up with blurred vision including a red ring around my vision, I knew I was playing football but they called in the next play and as quarter back you are supposed to know every play and what everyone is doing, which I normally did, it all sounded like a garbled mess to me at the time and I had to ask my teammates what the hell we were doing, we ran the play, I took the ball and scored while getting hit and driven into the ground, despite blurred vision, being unbalanced, just running off adrenaline and instincts. Got to the side line and the coaches asked me if I got knocked out, I said yes and they congratulated me on my toughness and being a team player, told me to drink some water and I could sit out a series on defensive(played both ways) but they needed me to shake it off and get going again because it was a one score game. No concussion evaluation, no time missed other than three plays on defense but not even the play immediately after the injury. 

I don't need a doctor to know that if a person has been knocked unconscious in a collision they have a concussion.

I was 13, I loved the sport, I loved my team, I didn't want to let anyone down or disappoint my coaches. Someone has to look out for these kids best interest, that's why this has become such a huge topic in the USA because for just about the entire history of the sport you were a ""pussy"" if you came out of a game with a head injury and for what, so we could win a middle school game? 

Everybody always talks about the big hits that knock players out, the truth is for every one of those, the one someone will actually tell you about, they got at least 3-4 good shots that ""rung their bell"". When someone says that what they mean is like in boxing, when someone catches a really nice flush punch and it causes them to drop their hands and their legs go weak but they don't go down and either stumble but catch themselves or clinch to stay up, sometimes they get a ""standing count"". The guy may not have been knocked out but he got injured on the punch and is trying his best to rebound, happens in football just about every game to someone. All of that adds up to potential brain problems later in life if unchecked and unmonitored. You ever seen a 60 year old career boxer? They are all jacked up."
"Perhaps you and your sister could mention this issue to a counselor at school. It's dangerous and your mom shouldn't wait. You guys could even make a call to CPS. CPS won't take you away from your parents but they will investigate what your dad is doing. If your brother has been to the doctor or the hospital for 5 concussions, that is something CPS should be called for. They may be able to put a stop to what your dad is doing. 

Talking to a counselor at school will help you too. They are mandatory reporters and they can call CPS for you. If your brother is playing football on the school's team, the counselor can also hopefully put a stop to your brother being allowed on the team.

You girls are good sisters. Don't wait for your parents, call CPS and talk to a school counselor ASAP."

However, I got into weightlifting and boxing classes after surgery at university. I've finally realised I can be athletic in my own way and I love being fit and in shape!

"I did this once by accident to my boyfriend. Since it's a one off thing maybe he did too? 

I remember I was just stressed out from assorted reasons. We went to hangout with our mutual friends. I invited him, because I love him and wanted to see him, but clearly I should have went on my own because it was obviously what I wanted. I wanted the attention of friends and I was being attention seeking. Unaware I was doing this, I would poke jokes at my BF, try to undermine his jokes to make myself sound funnier. I was using him to be the popular one.

Like u/zoomzoom42 said, it seems like there might be something underlying. 

Just make it known to him that it made you feel neglected. I honestly chnged my tune as soon as I realized how I made him feel. I thought he was handling my pokes and jokes like a champ, knew I was being weird and was being cool. Only thing he was being cool about was no making his discomfort and unhappiness visible to our friends.

If he defends his actions and doesn't apologize... well that's another issue all together and you may have to dig deeper. 

Also a difference I should note is that the friends we were with were  his close friends before they were mine, so I also did it out of trying to get them to like me more. (Childish, all of it)."

Then you guys had a reunion full of lust and desire that brought back a lot of the memories from when you were together, yet you still knew you didn't want to commit to him by the end. You're now pregnant with his child and you don't want to tell him and you don't want to cut him loose. Are you aware of how much emotional pain you're causing your ex? How confused he must feel by your previous actions? Now ask yourself how you plan on having him be part of your life while you keep this pregnancy from his knowledge? And if you do decide to terminate and not tell him or even ask him what he thinks how would you look at him ever again? How would he feel if he found out? You're being selfish."

And to your other part of your comment; yes, she *did* nuke the relationship.

"Gotcha, it was preemptive. 

This is **incredibly** common for anyone who has been in multiple relationships, or has had multiple sex partners. 

Sometimes we confuse ourselves and mix the people involved in our stories, but the stories themselves (the act/event/trip/sex/whatever) is the part we remember, sometimes details like the people who were involved get jumbled in our brain.. 

If she said ""You know, it was two months ago after that party at Joe's place"" and you don't know anyone named Joe and two months ago you were out of the country, then yeah something fishy may be going on. But if nothing else like that came up that made it suspicious, then forget about it. 

I'm 30 and have been married for six years and I genuinely just did this same thing to my wife a few months ago. 

Me: Hey what was the name of that restaurant we went to in Cancun years ago, the one where we saw that waiter slip and fall and throw a tray of full beers on that table?  
Wife: We have never been to Cancun, ever.  
Me: :| Oh ya...

It was a family trip when I was 19 and I was with my sisters and Mom. 

Obviously not sex, but the waiter falling was the main aspect of the story and that's the part I remembered. Not the people involved. "

"Okay, so look, here's the thing:

Go get the abortion. 

Secondly, you have a 2+ year relationship, and you freaked out because you weren't over it in a month? Please. You're 19 and I'm guessing this is your first major relationship. Expect it to take at least a year to get over it. Yeah, you're going to have some sad times and whatever - that doesn't mean anything. That's normal for a 19-year-old coming out of a two-year relationship. 

If you actually want to get over him, don't hang out with him, don't call him, don't text him. Down the road you can do that, but look, the first rule of getting over someone is to stop sleeping with them. The second rule of getting over someone is to stop hanging out with them. The third rule of getting over someone is to stop communicating with them. And the fourth rule of getting over someone is to give it some time. 

Don't tell him about the pregnancy. It'll only upset him, and since you're going to do it anyway since that's right for you (that's what I'm hearing, at least), it'll only add drama to your life and possibly make it impossible for you to be friends down the road, once you've gotten over him and might actually want to be friends.

Think of it this way. He has racist tattoos PERMANENTLY ON HIS BODY. That's how deeply he felt about them. The fact that he doesn't want to remove or cover them speaks deeply to the fact that he still feels that way enough to keep them there. Tattooing such trash on yourself is a hostile act in and of itself.

(And also... a guy who has had sex with a hooker would be a deal-breaker for a **lot** of girls)

"Ooo interesting theory ""Honey! Why did you take out $1000 in cash last week?! What the fuck!""

though why couldn't he just say he gave it to OP and have OP confirm story? "
"Hi back.  I'm just a couple years younger than you, and I'm raising two little boys in much the same way that you raised your stepdaughter. As far as I'm concerned, these boys are mine. Their biomom isn't viable and does more damage than good, and I'm the primary mom in their lives.   As such, my life is focused on them, and I've considered how that would play out if I was ever to split with their dad.  

While i have no legal right to the children I've been raising, I've been their mother for years, as far as they're concerned.  Even if I wanted nothing to do with their dad ever again, I've made a commitment to those children.  

You may not be legally obligated to do this, but you were this girl's mother.  You participated willingly in the role you played in her life. You knew who you were to her. 

Even though you've severed your relationship with her dad, you raised this kid. Where are your ethics? Where's your integrity? 
"
"You really need to talk to your wife about this. Especially if she still owes them money for her college. 

I get that your hands are tied since it's not your money, but there are a million ways that this will explode in your face if you go through with her parent's plan. I don't know if they're intentionally being assholes, or are just clueless rich people, but blowing $150K on a car THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN GET TO PICK OUT while she's still in debt is so cruel. And then to hijack her wedding? Jesus, dude. Don't do this.

What is her relationship with her parent's like? Is it possible that she's freaking out about you guys having secrets because they do this sort of stuff to her all the time?"
"This is true, but I'd agree with veosvos and still say that pitch black walls are just bad news, especially if it is a small room. Now, something like blue walls with an accent wall or two in black could be just fine depending on the blue, and the layout of the room."
"How. You are married to a man that violates other women. For me, this would be straight up divorce worthy.
Also, you are married to a man whom you know will lie to you and hide things, and obviously he did things like that before. 
Why are you still in this marriage?"
"He is an abusive and controlling man, and it was only a matter of time before he took it out either on you or your child. 

Where you go from here is to contact a family lawyer first thing Monday morning to see where you stand and what your options are. Even contact 2 or 3. Most lawyers offer free or low cost consultations. 

If you really can't face the idea of a lawyer, consult one anyway, because it may be happening whether you want it to or not. 

Next, look into a therapist for yourself, because this will be a rough ride for awhile and you seserve the support. Also, the therapist can help you examine the dynamic with your husband, which may be more problematic than you realize. 

You should only consider taking him back if he apologizes abjectly; attends individual therapy to address his issues; actually changes his attitude; and agrees to marriaget counseling with you as a last step. 

If he does not agree to these things, well, do you really want to be married to someone who gets his idea of what a husband is from the Taliban? 

"
I second this.  It is not acceptable for her to do this to you. . . let's not even think about what this will do to her child.
Sounds like you sat back and let him make all the sacrifices in the relationship. Where have you compromised or sacrificed for his happiness?
"Alex, I'll take ""he's married"" for $500."
I hope you're no longer in contact with her. That is insanely abusive :(
"[I remember this one from a few months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4at6b8/i_24f_inherited_a_lot_of_money_from_my/).

Grandma passed away, left a lot to OP, OP felt guilty about keeping it all because there were other grandkids in the equation. In that one, everyone was saying, ""Don't feel guilty, keep the money, no one else has a right to it, your cousins are just being entitled!""

Here? ""Maybe Grandma was a vindictive asshole, there had to be SOME reason, you don't know the situation well enough to comment,"" etc.

Interesting how the hivemind likes to throw itself behind OP, even if doing so makes for completely opposite results."
"Firstly, I don't approve, but actually he can probably do that. He is meeting his sons basic needs and providing him with food, housing, and ensuring he goes to school.

I think like many others that there may be something shady about his relationship with mom and daughters, but without any real evidence that's a stretch."
"I think this is disrespectful to you. Yeah, I watch porn and look at pictures of models...but I make sure that I don't do it in front of my GF."
Yeah but that entails waiting 30 more weeks for the baby to be born and poop. 
"Who cheated on a 15 year old who will likely now have problems trusting people for a _long_ time. Especially girls. If he can't even trust his sister's best friend, who can he? OP needs to seriously take a while to sit back and realize how much she hurt that poor kid _and_ his sisters."
"It's ""The Landlady,"" by Roald Dahl.  (Unless there's another very similar story.)

Stay safe, OP."
"They are his nephews and his last connection to his now dead brother.

Your other kids can use this as a ""dont be concerned with what others get"" learning experience. They have a dad, the others don't."
"It sounds to me like she has cold feet and is setting up a way to bail without being a runaway bride.  She wants sympathy instead of guilt when she makes this decision. The way it's building now, she may even be able to get you to be mad at her friends and family while her friends and family are mad at you, that way nobody sees that this whole thing was her issue in the first place and she never has to deal with the responsibility of having this very difficult and adult conversation with you."
"Unfortunately, if you look around this sub a bit, if you see a similar age range, it often looks like this. Guys like this see that lack of experience and take advantage. You did nothing wrong."
"I'm so sorry. That's a really hard situation to be in.

I'm not sure that talking to your dad is going to do anything at all. He's living in a fantasy world where his son is going to play in the NFL and he's going to be a big shot, and everyone is going to be happy. Why would he leave that world just to learn that he's probably done lasting harm to his own child and pulling him out of a sport he loves?

It's other people that you're going to have to talk to. Start with your mom. I know you girls are so smart, and so mature, but it's really your mom's responsibility to make this stop.

I hope that your mom is as level-headed and intelligent as you are, but I know sometimes people aren't lucky enough to have moms like that. If after talking to your mom she doesn't do anything, or can't do anything (make sure to ask her!) there's other people you can go to. You can speak to a guidance counselor or a trusted teacher at school; it doesn't have to be the coach since he's your dad's friend. Tell them facts only -- that your brother is having memory problems (any problems with movement?), he's blacked out X number of times, and he doesn't want to play football but your dad is forcing him. 

Teachers are something called ""mandatory reporters,"" which means that if they hear about someone mistreating a child, they have to tell someone. (Not every teacher does this - they might not take you seriously, or they might not care.) But often a good teacher or counselor will have good ideas and can talk to your dad.

I'm only going to recommend this third option as a ""nuclear"" option, and I'm only mentioning it so that you know, just in case things get a lot worse. You can call child protective services on your dad. They won't take you or your siblings away (abuse has to be very, very severe for that to happen), but they will send someone out to investigate and talk to your parents. Sometimes just having something so serious happen will knock the parent out of their little fantasy world. However, obviously, this is dangerous and can backfire. If the abuse/neglect isn't clear-cut, the investigation will be ""unfounded"" (it's like ""not guilty""), and sometimes this makes the parent even more self-righteous. The other danger is when it's ""founded"" (""guilty""). This usually means that CPS tells the family that they have to go to group therapy and check in with a social worker for a while. Obviously, if your dad isn't listening to anyone, this could be really good for your family. However, it will also show up on his background checks for a long time. Depending on the state, it's usually 15 years or until their youngest child turns 18. If he works with children or old people (as a coach, teacher, aide, etc.), this could prevent him from getting jobs. But if he doesn't, then this could really do a lot of good for the family. Like I said, this would be very serious, but if things get worse, you can call CPS anonymously.

I wish the best of luck to all three of you."
I keep mentioning getting formal charges brought against her to my dad (who is a lawyer but not the right type) and he always drags his feet about getting in contact with one. I really want to go to a lawyer though.
"Just tell her what you want. As long as you do ot nicely she will appreciate the instructions because then she knows she's doing it right. Everyone is different and different guys like different techniques, so don't approach it from the ""you're bad at this, do better"" angle, approach it from the ""let me show you what I like"" angle. As far as phrasing goes tell her ""try __"" or ""can you ___"" and then if it feels good be very vocal/show that you're having a good time."
"Its your opinion that sex work is not wrong, maybe his opinion is that it is wrong.  Its irrelevant. If she did nothing wrong, then he did nothing wrong either.  Yeah, maybe he as a problem with her history, but from his point of view her history is a problem.  There's nothing wrong with being straightforward about that, he can be clear, she's not a kid, she can handle her emotions without being coddled.

You can't tell me anyone doing a porno would expect every potential future boyfriend to be okay with it?  I'm gonna get massively downvoted for this, but I frankly believe its a bad decision, from their point of view.  It impacts your future career, your future relationships.  But hey, people are free to make their own decisions.  I'm just saying you passing judgment on ""who is in the wrong"" isn't helpful at all.  Its just as easy to pass judgment on her and say she's in the wrong as it is to say that he's in the wrong."
"Sorry you had a tough childhood. Regardless, that does not excuse what you're trying to excuse, and if your response to ""why are you lying to your boyfriend"" is ""my mom tried to kill me when I was 3,"" you probably shouldn't be in a relationship at all."
I'm seconding the car. Other than the ice cream it seems that most of these occasions involved you driving somewhere.
Yeah yeah yeah it's easy to talk when you aren't the person literally being shit on.
"Marriage doesn't have to be a big deal - my aunt and uncle have been together for ~30 years, and literally just got married last year because they don't want to create difficulties for whoever survives when one of them dies.

That said, not wanting to be married when your partner does? That can mean a lot. If it's just a bit of paper, then why didn't you get married years ago? It's a big enough deal to you that you've been avoiding it for 6 years, even though you know it'll ""mean the world to her"".  And that's okay! Marriage can be a big deal and it can come with a lot of cultural baggage, and there are a lot of reasons why you can choose not to get married. But saying ""I know how important marriage is to my partner, which is why even though I know she's been wanting for us to be married for three years, I'm still intending on proposing at some point in the future, with an even vaguer date for marriage after that."" is just... well, honestly, it's not kind.

You spent the past three years telling her, in actions if not in words, that the thing that means the world to her, doesn't mean anything to you. I don't know why she'd believe you when you say you do plan on marrying her. And even if she did, you seem to have missed the point of why she wants it.

Marrying someone creates legal ties-- it's an act of immense trust, a public statement of how much you value this person in your life, of saying that you are planning on sharing your life with them and that, if something does happen to you, you want them to still have your home, everything you can give them. It's saying that you can't anticipate a future where you don't want them by your side, and you trust them with everything you have and you trust that, if you can't speak for yourself (if you're in an accident or something), you trust them to speak for you.

"&gt;I have not smoked for months now and I feel like the life inside me is slowly slipping away. 

Dude, that is a clue that you had in fact become addicted/reliant on it.

I'd see a medical doctor. But I realise you are a bit wary of that"
"Getting a photographer is different than doing a ""public proposal"""
Yeah my mom did this when I was cutting myself and it shut me down. I just cut in the bathroom on places she couldn't see and stopped talking to her about it. I cut for 8 more years and finally stopped when I got out of the hell hole that was her parenting and into treatment. 
Would you feel the same way if a man was secretly recording his SO?
"I don't think you should do something that you don't want. Lifting is great, yes. But we can't force it down people's throats."
"I find it telling that he didn't own up to it himself. Someone else told you. But I'm an internet stranger, so there might be other things I don't know. "
Can you ask the translator you paid if it can be converted to mean something else? I know little about arabic but it may be salvageable. 
"""Don't blame me if he doesn't show up and you embarrass the bride. I'm not going to waste breath trying to convince you since you've already made up your minds."" Then get it in writing that they can't blame you and have one parent sign it.

Because I bet they'll blame you for not trying hard enough to convince them that it wasn't a prank.

"
His depression is not a reason for you to tolerate this behavior. I empathize for him but you need to get away from him. The sooner the better. 
"You have gone to alot of trouble to connect these two things.. but they really aren't connected.  

An engagement party is just a party.  It may feel important to you but in the big picture is just isn't.  There is no way I would drive 14 hours to go to a party.  It's not your wedding.  It sounds like he's planning on going to your wedding.  

As far as you spending the money to go to his wedding.  That is really only known by you.  If the money for the trip will really set you back that badly then maybe you should reconsider it.  I'm sure your brother will be disappointed but frankly that stuff happens when you have a 'destination wedding'.  

If you do not go to his wedding.  Do not expect him to come to yours.  He might.  He may recognize that it was just a money thing.  But if he gets the slightest whiff that you didn't go because he didn't come to your party.. expect this to be the end of your relationship.  

PS.. the Dad &amp; Mom thing... that's just f'd up beyond belief.  Your dad is a selfish prick.  This isn't about HIM it's about you and your brother.

"I think that's the approach I'm going to present. I think it makes sense to contribute to the joint account in proportion to our income - is that what you guys do? Also, how do you deal emotionally with the vast income disparity? It seems to be taking a real toll on my hubs, even though it wasn't unexpected."
I just spoke to my sister and she said she is going to miss me to. We are going to talk on Skype every Saturday and I can and visit her over the summer or she will come home  
"She knows that if she continues to cam that we're over, she won't stop so that's it. Nothing to rebuild. She sees it as a just a job, I see it as cheating. That's the problem.

"Actually, when ovarian cysts rupture, they usually dissolve before reaching the uterus, so most women don't notice when the cyst is passed - a ruptured cyst has the same pains and slight bleeding that most women attribute to premenstrual symptoms.

An ultrasound confirmed that I had recently ruptured a rather large ovarian cyst, that coupled with the passing of a mass lead my doctor to believe that it must've just not dissolved completely before reaching my vaginal canal. 

I'm pretty sure it wasn't a fibroid, those are usually chronic and there wasn't anything to suggest that I had any growths. I've had another few cysts, but haven't passed anything since that one. I've also had a (high risk) pregnancy in the interim, so I've been through the ringer in terms of my reproductive organs.

Yay!"
"I get the impression from OP's post that she already tried the tactful approach, and the friends are still trying to argue."
"OP should also learn about his rights as a tenant. They can't just kick him out, they have to evict him. That could give him some extra time."
"She has BDD cut her some slack. This is probably exacerbated by her older, grooming, SO."
"Get yourself a bottle of rubbing alcohol (I have 70%) and a bottle of ""Grandma's Secret Spot Remover"" (from Hobby Lobby if you can't find it anywhere else - I found it on the fabric cutting table).

Next time it happens, you may be able to salvage some stuff with a bit of time and elbow grease. I just managed to save one of my wife's work shirts that she left a pen in. That was a damn mess and it took me over an hour and almost a whole roll of paper towel, but I saved that damn thing.

As for asking her to pay for your clothes, that's tricky. I would say let her know you're upset about the situation and ask her to please be sure to check her pockets from now on. Or to maybe start doing loads of your clothes separately from hers to avoid this again.

Edit: Use the alcohol to pull out the ink, then the spot remover for minor leftover color that needs to be cleaned up."
"As someone who was/is suicidal, this is very accurate at least to my case. Some days I just wake up and avoid everyone because I just don't want to upset them. My first and second attempts came from me feeling completely and utterly unwanted by my friends and family even though they didn't say or indicate as such. It's irrational thinking but it's what goes on in the mind of someone who is depressed. Sorry if I didn't put this very well. "
Haha one granola bar wrapper and she must be throwing it in the woods rather than putting the GRANOLA BAR WRAPPER in her pocket.
"I definitely plan on reducing contact. I began reducing the impact they have on my life while I was in college (basically just standing up to my decisions and not letting them reduce my feelings or make me cry every time I did something they didn't like). My parents can get frazzled and grumpy over the smallest things, so planning a few hours of time every few weeks/months is the best way to keep everyone happy."
It sounds like this is something that could have happened even while they were away at work on a normal day. It doesn't take several days for that to happen. Unfortunately you won't easily be able to convince your emotions of that and the guilt is understandable even though it was in no way your fault. The flowers were nice. For now just keep being kind to them and yourselves. 
"What did your sisters buy with their inheritance and are you entitled to use it whenever you want?

"&gt; he then proceeded to list my many defects and how they all make me a terrible wife.

What the fuck. This is reprehensible. 

Seriously reconsider your marriage to this man. He is trying to browbeat and bully you into having a child. This is not the mark of a respectful, good person."
"I just want to add that the way people handle their anger can be a deal breaker for you even if they're not abusive. As someone who has had to deal with emotional abuse by an angry person, I have the same problem as you. 

What I've found is that I need to be with someone who doesn't handle their anger with yelling. They can be a good person who loves me and wouldn't ever hurt me, but yelling puts me in such a bad place I can't handle it. Its ok to not want the person you're with to yell at you in an argument. 

If he's really a good guy who loves you he will want to do what he can to minimize you reliving feelings of abuse. Yelling isn't the only way a person can express their angry emotions.  "
"You both kinda screwed up by not talking about it beforehand. It's a bachelor party, and stripclub is definitely a possibility. He should have broached the subject, but so should you. Personally, I don't have a problem with his behaviour, and wouldn't mind if my partner did something similar, but everybody gets to decide what they are okay with. Communication is key."
I feel a little bit of shame and pride at remembering each of these posts.
"I agree. It's cool and all that he was OK with it when she said no to quitting and staying at home (though who knows how long that'll last), but it's weird as hell that he would suggest it when they don't have children and they have no plans to ever have any. Because he said so...."
"Just out of curiosity, where are you guys getting this fact? I guess I might have reevaluate my knowledge on the infectious characteristics.

I am a herpes developer, and HSV-1 prefers latency in the ear nerves, where as HSV-2 prefers the spine. They also have a tendency for two different mucosal layers. 

Due to their near identical form, of course there will be some crossover, but I was told it was MUCH lower than a whopping 50% of cases, and result in less outbreak than HSV-2.

"
"I'm surprised she doesn't see this as more of a huge blinking, flashing, trumpet blaring red flag for what's to come in this relationship.

Unfortunately, this is only the beginning of the troubles that are about to come between you, her and your child.  

I would be prepared if I were you for entering into legal custody talks in the near future as her boyfriend is going to do all he can to get between your family and you."
"I think the original comment might not have been very clear. It's not about her being responsible for him, it's about her being responsible for herself. She fucked up by ""letting him"" drive (as in, allowing him to drive when she was in the car) drunk, she never should have gotten into that car with him. If she had refused to get in the car and he'd driven off, then it'd be totally on him. But she made the choice to get in the car knowing he was drunk and allowed him to drive that way. It's partially her responsibility.

She's not responsible for his choice to drive drunk, but she is responsible for choosing to get in the car and let him drive them both while he was drunk. "
"There's nothing wrong with 15%. The only thing tacky here is the fact that your girlfriend is grandstanding with her holier than thou attitude and being generous with YOUR money instead of her own. But are you really surprised? Be prepared for a ""my money is my money and your money is our money"" dynamic for as long as you're in a relationship with this smug freeloader."
This is exactly what I first thought. Charlie's gf might put pressure on him to propose when she sees two people she introduced get married first.

"Tell him he can't abdicate his family responsibilities. You need him to bring home milk/eggs/whatever, it isn't your problem he ""can't"" go in the most convenient store. You need it, he needs to figure out how to get it. And since he's the one who limits the restaurants/hotels you can go to, he needs to take responsibility for finding and making reservations with places he finds acceptable. So he's planning your dates from now on, your family days out, your vacations. If airfare costs more, so be it. If he has to drive an hour out of his way to another grocery store, so be it. How much fun will his hobby be then?"
"Dude, you're using the excuse that you have this fake account to express your various political opinions in order to talk to women on FB.

You're getting some sort of satisfaction by flirting with other women with this account and your wife obviously doesn't like it.

Quit being a dumbass and delete this other account. If your political opinions are so divisive that expressing them on your main account would possibly get you fired from your job or cause others to not like you, then maybe you should rethink your mindset and open up your world view or else just stop posting your opinions on social Media. Otherwise, your wife is probably not likely to put up with your cheating bull shit much longer and your life is going to get a hell of a lot more complicated."
"My brother and I used to fight very roughly, and yep, I've copped quite a few kicks to the groin.  Its amazingly and uniquely painful, a very strange sensation.  So I don't doubt you at all.  I am, however, concerned that its still hurting after five days.  Do you mean tender and bruised or worse?  Tingling?  Google pelvic fracture and if the symptoms match, go back to your doctor.

As for the bullying, don't be pressured into 'proving' you're a woman.  Believe me, they will try.  Tackle their ignorance instead.  ""What, you didn't realise women can get hurt with a kick to the groin?  Ridiculous.""  It will pass if you can laugh their ignorance off."
So disrespectful and rude on a most basic level. Degrading. What a horrible feeling :(
"&gt; ""Awww sorry! I have a boyfriend and he is... how can I say... he's so BIG! After I met him, other men cannot compete""

The thought of somebody saying this is so fucking cringey. "
I was thinking something along those lines. Some reason for the sister to really hate the idea of the roommate dating her brother *and* for the roommate to know it. People don't typically hide relationships from siblings lightly.
"So, let me get this straight.  He texts you.  You reply back.  And then you get angry because he doesn't reply right away?  Does what you're replying back even require an answer?

Here's another thought process that a lot of people aren't taking into account.  He's asking a question.  You answered.  And from what you've described, they're pretty mundane questions that don't need an immediate response.  Just because you're choosing to doesn't mean that he views them in the same regard.

This is a communication issue, and both of you need to temper your expectations.  He can be more responsive, but you should take a good hard look at yourself and ask, ""Why am I so concerned with how quickly he's responding back?"""
"&gt; How could she have known you would have stuck around if she told you early on? 

Honestly, it simply wasn't her call to make. Maybe he WOULD'VE left and he should've been given that option. In his case, that isn't what would have happened. But what if this was a deal breaker? A huge deal breaker? And she let it lie for YEARS?

What a shitty thing to do to the both of them."
"Great answer!  One times it seems like everyone's answer in Reddit is always go to the police or CPS, but it's obvious they have never been in a domestic situation that had CPS involved.  It's much more complicated than, ""dad is mean"" and ""this isn't fair"".  Unfortunately being a mean and unfair parent isn't illegal."
"The fact she's a gymnast means puberty might have hit her later too. She might not have had as much time to deal with hormones as you'd expect her age to have. Combined with the Catholic guilt and fatherly taught abstinence (always kinda gross), it's easy to see how it would be hard to reconcile. "

"In my experience, resentments that built up for months and years will never go away. It sort becomes part of you. I say this because I been in your shoes, just not trauma related--more like, job related. My biggest mistake was I kept putting my bf first, life second and me last. And when we had ducks in a row, my ex wouldn't even work for our relationship, just like your ex-wife. In the end, I broke up with him only to try seven years after. We're not together anymore because I couldn't let go that anger. We're friends now. It's better than having romantic relationship with him.  My hardest lesson in my life is to put each other first, not him or me first. It has to be both. We can't be selfless or selfish.  

My advice for you is to take a step back, accept there will be resentments and that they might not go away. It's nearly impossible. If you want to reconcile with your wife, you need space. Both of you. Space for you to work on yourself and that mean therapy, new hobbies, distraction, meditation, whatever works for you and take your time. It might be a month or even a year because I don't think you're ready for a relationship despite how much you want one with her or with anyone and I think you know this too. Space for her too, so she won't get hurt in the process of reconciliation or rebuilding friendship if romance department doesn't work. If she says she loves you then tell her to give you space but don't let her wait for you. You might never be ready for her and it's unfair for her to put her life on hold for you regardless how much pain she had inflicted on you. 

If you don't want to go that route, then take it slow. Don't jump like your parents set up for you to make up each other or whatever they expected. Forget their expectations or anyone's. Stop cuddling or having those intimate moments. Start over again. Literally start over. Go dating like you're meeting each other for the first time and in some case, that part is true. You're both different person now, get to know each other. See if you can work but don't get in a relationship with her because you were good together in the past. That part is over, it's dead. It doesnt' exist anymore. Don't try with her because it's familiar. That's the worst thing you can ever do to yourself. We're creatures of habit and we tend to fall back into the cycle not because it's good for us, we do it because it's familiar and we don't take chances on the unknown. Break the cycle. I did and you can do it too.

Most importantly, don't blame yourself. You did your best with her and it didn't work. It might not work this time and that's okay. Some things don't work and you have to let it be. I'm going to say one thing that I realized before I broke up with my bf and it's only because of my baby cousin. You see, he had this toy, the kind one that put shapes on the right sorter. I saw him trying to put the square toy in a circle-shaped hole and he kept hammering it down but no matter how much he tried, it won't fit through that hole. Just looking at him clicked it for me.

Don't force it."

Late night emails usually are reports people worked on that evening and sent out before going to bed (by the way pro-tip, don't do that, save it in your outbox and give it a lookover during daylight), and early morning messages are usually along the lines of ""Bob called in sick, someone needs to address customer issue such and such, call me when you get to the office"".

Personal messages between co-workers deep in the night are suspect of a persons motivations, and your girlfriend knows this, and more importantly, you deep down know this. Take some time, some distance, and work this through if you weren't emotionally involved but rather if someone else came to you with this story.

I think it is time for a clear, middle of the day talk with your SO. If she continues to defend her actions in some way there is no resolving this.

"&gt; heard me once or twice ask permission which honestly normal couples do everyday

First off, no normal couples don't do this every day.

Secondly, she may not want her cousin to get the idea that it's normal for a woman to ask permission of her husband. Or be hiding bruises!

"&gt; I kept the cat.

Best part of the story!"
I guess it depends on how fast it was. 3 rapid fire pecks on the lips and i would probably be paralyzed from surprise. 
It sure doesn't sound like he's the one if he can't and won't respect your wishes.
He doesn't trust you because you went to the bathroom once?
"If  you had done anything in that situation there's a good chance you'd both have been arrested and he'd also have m.i.p. charges.

She's in the wrong here."
"I agree with you about this guy. He sounds kinda of shady and creepy, in my opinion. 

Now, from a guys POV.

Condoms for first sexual encounters absolutely. Speaking for myself, unless I am in a relationship with a girl, or we have been seeing each other for a while. These would be the only reasons not to use one. Plus, she would **have** to be on birth control. Good for you OP on being proactive in this situation, in addition with already being on birth control. 
"
"Pretty clearly his comment about how Gamer Girl doesn't have a boyfriend who "" respects her enough to not want her to show off her body"" was the hypocritical bullshit it sounded like, because he doesn't respect you.  He doesn't respect your needs, your comfort, your desires, your space (I'm assuming your instagram is not full of naked dudes), your honesty and intimacy, or your literal body.

Maybe he's a porn addict (I think looking at porn every day while at work--even on break--counts, myself), but he's definitely a jerk, and he's a jerk who has shown a complete unwillingness to change. 

You deserve to be with someone who makes you feel beautiful, not someone who blatantly and repeatedly tries to diminish you."
"Why have you not kicked him out of your house yet? Jesus fuck, he's a shitty guest, get rid of him now. You BF needs to lay down the law **hard** on this asshole."

"In all seriousness, do you think you're going to marry her?"
"The (scientific) jury is in on smacking children, and it *can* cause harm to children, so there's no reason to risk it. Our parents smacked us because they didn't know better, but we do. I couldn't knowingly have children with someone who has been upfront about wanting to potentially harm children. ""I'll try not to"" is a cop out to try and make the conversation go away."
"Oh you better believe this has already been x-posted, we've actually had like two of these kind if stories posted in the last day or so, so the llamas are realllyy riled up. Fun place!!!"
"I definitely understand why they would get emotional. A lot of people, myself included, get really attached to their homes and it's difficult to think about that space being altered. So I get why this would make them a little sad. But hello-- you *bought* this house from them. It's not their home anymore. It sounds like they sold it with the (irrational) understanding that they'd be able to reap the benefits of the sale without having to completely sever the emotional ties to the house like they would if they sold it to a stranger. That's not fair. They need to recognize that their memories aren't inextricably tied to the physical house, and that you have every right to do whatever you want with the place.


EDIT: Here's a little gift idea if you want to extend an olive branch: Hire a photographer to take a photo of the house before you tear it down, then get it printed on canvas or have it framed. They can hang it in their current home and remember the good times they had when they lived there."
"So last night we were having sex but I really wasn't there. I guess she picked up on it because she asked if everything was OK so we stopped and I told her then and there.

 That I would not accept this behavior and that we were breaking up. It went all right. I told her that I would stay friendly and that I would not say to anyone how/why we broke up so she could still maintain out mutual friendships and to be honest I have nothing against her.  She is going through a lot and I don't want to add to the pile. I just don't think I can be romantically involved anymore. 

We slept in the same bed with no interaction. This morning she prepared a letter saying how she is in a difficult place and she didn't men it. I said that I wouldn't care and it's not up to her to choose what I feel, especially after just a couple of months together. 


We had a bit of an altercation about how important I am and how much this means to her and at first I was giving in and raised my voice to match but then (luckily) realized how stupid we were and managed to bring back the conversation to normality.  

 Then I guess she was trying to hurt me by saying that I have no empathy  because I didn't want to put myself in her shoes and that I should be doing that. I didn't agree, said my goodbyes, re affirmed that there would be no hostility from my part and left for work. 

She should have left by now. 

In the end i'm glad I went through with it and face to face. I've been in relationships lasting years but I never had to deal with this behavior.

 Thank you guys for being there for me. I didn't want to speak to my friends and ruin the status quo between them. You have been very helpful !

Again, thank you so much !

**tl;dr** Broke up, no one is dead, the world is still spinning. Still feeling like a bit of a knob because of her mom but I guess that would have been a shit excuse to stay together. "
"Your right, it isn't like we didn't give him a chance to stop.  I really hope he does get the help he needs."
I'm not sure it should be the most important part of you. That's extreme

"He ""vaguely"" remembered the restraining order, but was apparently able to remember clearly that it was no longer in effect, since the latter benefited his own interests."
"Four SAS guys were taken too. One is now a very famous author and one is from New Zealand and none were Colonels.

"Truth. My boss charges $250, but pays me almost $20, and somewhere between those numbers are things like the building, utilities, our benefits, his CLEs, funding for his pro bono cases, and other shit. He's going to bill almost a million dollars this year, and I guarantee you he's not taking home more than 250,000... and that's if this one jackass would just fucking pay his bill. Because that's the other part. You can bill a million bucks and it doesn't matter. It's whether or not you can collect a million bucks."
"Think about micromanaging this way: how much of a difference would there be if your GF make the change you want her to. Does it really matter if she cuts her sandwiches diagonally or horizontally? No. Does it matter how she folds her laundry? No, but if you know an easier/more efficient technique tell her ""I know a technique I think is more efficient, would you like me to demonstrate?"" and if she says she wants to keep folding the laundry the way she does now, let her. If she's buying a car and you know the dealer she is looking at is not reputable, for example, then it would be appropriate to give her unsolicited advice, since it's such an important thing. Or if she's doing something dangerous, like putting metal in the microwave.

I hope that was helpful!"
"That bit was kind of tossed off but to me, one of the worst red flags in the whole situation for how he actually views her and their relationship. If they live together, barring a specific agreement about chores that is not 50/50 for mutually agreed upon reasons, it is appalling that he sulked because she didn't thank him for ""helping her"" clean. He is an adult man and she's not his maid. "
"Yeah. From now on, the mom might pretend to want makeup she intends/plan to hand over to the gf. I wouldn't hand anything over unless she scratches up the container of the product or even just transports the product to a different/blank container."

"&gt;I know for a fact that Noelle wants David &amp; Kate together because she thinks they're the perfect couple and that way she and Kate can be family.

No way. Cut her off.

OP, I'm very concerned that your wife is still having the affair, and has just taken it underground. 

If she's really remorseful, then she would not put up a fight about giving up her friend. That fact that she refuses makes me thinkg **she's still seeing David**.

This is very very common. Affair gets exposed, then it just goes underground.

"Well, he did mention it wasn't worth taking pictures of. Could've been the Waffle House."
You breaking up with him wasn't immature.  He was continuously lying to you leading you to believe that he didn't understand why he wasn't losing weight when he knew full well that he was eating junk and he watched you research why he wasn't losing weight. And he made you feel bad and guilty about wanting to better yourself. That's awful.  And then your reputation got trashed for the break up and he's blaming his friends for that but its ridiculously unlikely that they got there on their own.  he treated you poorly and there is nothing for him to forgive you for.  I hope he hasn't said otherwise
"Yeah, I mean-I'd NEVER be able to get rid of EVERYTHING that I feel I wouldn't want a student or parent to see, so I just don't add ANY of them.  I don't even add former graduates.  I teach in a small town where everyone knows everyone, and a local state university (where many graduates attend) is only 15 minutes away.  

I use a private Facebook page specifically for my groups, but my Facebook profile is pretty private, preventing most things from being seen by people with whom I'm not friends.  

Only a few non-district employees have my personal phone number.

Apps like Remind completely alleviate the need for them to have it anyway.  "
"His problem was as he was cleaning it up he thought ""what are the odds a student is going to go back 6 years?"" And stopped cleaning up things at that point. A gamble he lost since they went through ALL his facebook that was available and happened to find his sex joke from 8 years before that point.

Personally, i also know that it'd be pretty impossible of me to get rid of everything that'd be bad... so I am also of the mind Im not going to add them as well. I also have my stuff as private and ""locked down"" as possible on social media. 


I know so many teachers and student teachers who share their cells with students. Im just like ""nah. Thats not for me."" Ignoring the potential of inappropriateness, there's the potential of texts or calls late at night because homework or projects. So im of the mind, need me? Email me. Or wait till tomorrow in class. I just happen to like my privacy, boundaries, and my sleep.

Ordinarily I would agree, but in this case they seem pretty evenly matched :/"
"Hmm, I don't know if he was out of line in this *particular* instance, but the fact that he regularly has verbal confrontations with strangers is concerning. Most people go years without getting into a fight like you've described here, so imo his behavior is a red flag. He's obviously inviting trouble and thrives on sparring with strangers, like you said. This would be a deal breaker for me but it's up to you to decide if you can live this with behavior."
"She said:

&gt; I have taken him off my credit card. I will not lend him any more money.

The issue at hand is not how to stop him from spending more of her money, it's how to recoup what he's already spent."

"Dude, she fucked someone else *in front of you*.

Alcohol is not an excuse.

You guys need some serious couples counseling, followed by some deep discussions. 

Some people can get over cheating, but for many, it's a giant deal breaker. You need to decide if it is for you too. For me, it absolutely is. I'm not living my life stressing over what my husband is doing when I'm not around. Hard pass. "
"Look, baby aside, it sounds like you are going to be much better off without this woman in your life. I read that whole post and the whole thing is a train wreck. I mean you do realise this woman is not good right?

Dates, times, what you didsaid, vice-versa, when you were blocked, when she did XYX, screenshots, save everything.  
Lock down all your finances, cards, accounts, social media, everything.  
This could well be pregnancy hormones, but it could also be her finally showing her true colous."
"Whenever you feel like it's serious-ish and will likely continue.

Don't roll it out on the first date, but the 5th, 6th, when you start hanging out in each other's homes... Then it's time to make sure it's clear."
"Good idea. I kinda already knew I had to had a talk about him about this whole situation. It's just weird, because over teh years, he never had any problem telling me the truth about stuff, so I don't know why he'd have trouble now."
"Do you think he would care how many you've slept with? If its the sort of thing you think would be a dealbreaker, then yes you should disclose now rather than later, because if he finds out later its going to be a shitshow. If you don't think he really cares, then no need to tell him, as long as you were safe with the other guys then no problem. "
"Claims that he actually does want to spend the rest of his life with her. Claims getting married isn't a big deal to him and he's willing to do it if it is what she wants to do. Claims he knows how much marriage and getting married now means to her. Yet still apparently needs ""6-8 months to mentally prepare"" to *propose*? Yeah, that definitely reads as ""I don't actually want to get married I'm just hoping if I keep putting off a proposal maybe she'll just give up the idea about marriage"" to me. If he is so unwilling to propose right now, despite supposedly being all for marriage like he is trying to claim, I too highly doubt it will actually happen in 6-8 months. "
"I agree with the others. It sounds like she is drinking again. And I'm really sorry OP.

I agree that catching her in the act is the best way to prove it all. It might be a little too much but maybe set up a camera in your bedroom or the bathroom and see if you catch her doing it? It might be a little too much but then again you're dealing with a baby's well being... 

Have you ever found wine bottles around before? Because if you're suddenly noticing them, they probably haven't been laying around before that."
"Ex-addict here. She's going to freak out and refuse to blow in it, and get upset with you for not trusting her. I can almost guarantee it."
"I don't think this is about her needing your approval of gayness at all. I think this is about the fact that she made what was clearly an important and emotional revelation (for her) to you, and you didn't seem to care at all. Does she know you care about her? You ""let her"" go on and on, like you would let the lady checking out your groceries go on and on? Your daughter isn't yammering about something unimportant. Connect with your kid. You sound like a really shitty dad. This isn't about you, your feelings about homosexuality, or how perplexed you are. It's about how you deeply hurt your daughter's feelings.

Also, don't brag about being emotionally unavailable and having a ""whatever"" attitude toward your daughter, and then act surprised that your indifference toward what's important to her is upsetting. You sound like a selfish prick."
"That was what I was thinking. He can't possibly have been drunk at the tent putting up stage, or when hiking, and probably not when cooking. It looks to me as if he's trying to deflect attention to the stuff about music and games round the fireside, rather than the point that all three of them attacked OP's core competence."
Please be careful and look into recording laws for your state (and hers if she lives in another state as you). Recording phone calls can be very tricky even of you don't plan to use them in any legal capacity.

"I didn't explicitly know that he would be going to a strip club. I was expecting that it could be a possibility, given the nature of bachelor parties. The bachelor party was a weekend at a cabin in the woods, so I was also thinking that they also might not even have the opportunity to go to one. Also, these guys do NOT seem like the strip club ""type"". I honestly didn't really know. And I figured that my boyfriend would have mentioned it, at least once during out hours-long text conversation when I asked him what he was up to. At the time, he just mentioned that they were all drinking and hanging out, which I assumed to be at the cabin.

But I totally understand where you're coming from. I definitely overreacted, and I should have been more communicative before he left. I just need to know how to move forward from here."

Maybe you should start things off by having Kevin pay rent? Hes kind of walking all over you and this seems like a symptom of that larger pattern of behavior.
"I don't agree. I think he completely ignored what she liked and wanted. Saying that you enjoy a place doesn't mean you want a proposal there, especially if you were specific about the kind of proposal you had dreamed of. She wanted something more public, but he wanted something entirely private. They could have done something around close friends and family, but they didn't. They went somewhere private. He didn't want to do it on top of the Eiffel Tower, but he totally wrote off doing it in France at all even though they were already in France and wouldn't have had to plan an extra vacation to make it happen. She wanted a photographer, he flat out vetoed it. Engagement pictures are not the same thing as proposal pictures. It just doesn't seem like he made any compromises, and he's surprised she didn't like what he came up with."
"&gt;My husband freaked out when he heard the news and is demanding my parents ground my brother.

Your husband doesn't get to ""demand"" that your parents do anything. Yikes. Who does he think he is? If he has a legitimate issue he can make it known. Otherwise his options are to shut up or to shut up."
Or maybe he has a thing for OP's brother?
"It's not stupid, it's heartbreaking. 

You're reminding me of a friend of mine who went ahead and married his gf who was like yours. About 15 years later he was having a godawful marital crisis. It was eating him alive that in middle age, he had never once had good sex. He had never once had the experience of having a woman desire him and be hot for him. They had other issues as well, but the sexual incompatibility was the real soul-killer for him.

He ended up going through a rough divorce and some bad years, but then he found a divorced woman who is really into him, and he finally started experiencing a healthy relationship. I was afraid for him that he would go to his grave without ever having had decent sex, which is heartbreaking imho."
"&gt;Am I being stupid?

Yes. He did nothing wrong, they were obviously just geeking out over his climbing gear, and you did violate his privacy by snooping.

"Wow. The entitlement complex is strong in that one.

It doesn't sound like she really respects you all that much, do you think that's a fair assessment of the situation? If so, maybe explain to her that you don't appreciate her assumption that you will give up your space and pay for everything. When you move in with her it will be because you both want to, not out of convenience, and you'd hope that everything is shared equally. That this is a special step and you don't take it lightly, and that right now you're happy with where things are at. 

If she pushes remind her you have boundaries and you'd appreciate that she respect them. Respect me, respect my boundaries and such like."
"You are NOT psycho. He sounds like a digusting pig to be doing all these things. He's a grown ass man. If he can't pull it together and stop his immature, baby behavior, I wouldn't stay around. He needs to grow up and I wouldn't wanna be the girlfriend who has to deal with this. Not to mention... How GROSS to have to hear/see/smell. Ugh. "

Its not cheating in the normal relationship sort of way, but I'd argue the deception and double life is itself cheating. "
"You're kinda trash, OP. You don't want your wife back. You want your wife to WANT you back so it can feed your ego. Your wife rocks, and she'll find someone much better than you very shortly.

"Yeah. Boundaries is the key concept here. 

Who cares if he has six groomsmaids or 7 bridemen or a bonobo ring-bearer? OP is concerned about her partner's lack of appropriate boundaries with people outside his/their relationship. 

We see this shit everyday on this sub. Could be a parent or a sister or even a best friend, but when someone in a marriage feels like their partner isn't willing to draw a circle around their relationship and say ""this is us, this is home"".... It bad."
The next time you're both together just imagine your wife taking a load in the mouth from some guy that's making minimum wage. That should give you the balls to kick her to the curb.

"Yes!  Very well stated. I suspect that part of the reason she is upset may be that it seemed as if OP didn't recognize how big a deal coming out was for *her* as a member of society,  rather than just as his daughter. Perhaps she wasn't seeking his approval but, rather,  trying to find a way to express that she has been suffering with issues of identity and needs his support. OP, while part of me loves your reaction,  I can see where she may have felt hurt by it. To offer an admittedly weak comparison, imagine that she had just told you that she had just broken up with someone and you had a similar reaction. Perhaps it's your way of showing her that is not a big deal and that she'll be fine, but she could see it as a sign that you don't really care about how she's *feeling*. There is a lot of hope here, however, and I'm looking forward to a positive update. "

"When you're seeing someone new, and you're at the point where you may want to have sex, that's a good time to disclose the issue. You don't have to go into a lot of detail. You can just say you have a medical condition that makes your periods very painful, and there are times where you won't be feeling well enough to enjoy sex. A potential partner that you'd like to keep in your life will not have a problem with it.    

I can relate in a way... I have PMDD, so my periods are a huge struggle, although it's more emotional than physical. It's hard to tell a guy ""Oh, by the way... I get depressed to the point of being suicidal or harming myself or others every 28 days. Are you cool with that?"". I didn't know what was wrong with me or that this wasn't normal for years. Thankfully, I have an SO who was cool with it from the start, even though his first experience of Shark Week with the Auntie Christ was hell. If anything, he encouraged me to do whatever I needed to to feel okay during those times. Someone worth having in your life will understand and support you. I don't think I would have found a way to manage it without his urging and support. Different condition, but I think the type of empathy and support in a partner is good to both ends."
"Yeah... At some point, she should have at least told you that she was incapable of having children due to a medical condition (being born the wrong gender is a medical condition that she has since corrected, but it does nothing for fertility). Pretending to be able to have children when she knows it's not possible... That's a line. Realistically, if she never told you, how would that have played out? Would you have tried for the next 5-10 years, gone to see infertility doctors (who would pretend to give her fertility treatments and drugs against medical ethics), then cried together when it just didn't happen despite your best efforts? That's just kind of shitty and really shows how little she trusted you with this knowledge. Sure, it's not first date information, but after a few months, surely she should have said something. If she was worried for her safety, she could have tried to gauge your probable reaction (by seeing if you were comfortable around other trans or gay people) then told you over the phone."

"&gt; If I had an employee like this, it still would reflect negatively on them, since this is just an indicator of the kind of company they keep.

That a 20 year old college kid has an immature 19 year old girlfriend? It's a frickin' intern. You're supposed to be teaching them. 

It depends on the industry and the company and whatnot, but at my company, if this happened, I would have the manager speak with the intern about how important it is to make sure that their online presence presents a positive impression of them and to tweak their security settings appropriately.

As an aside, I'm a little older than the average redditor, but I find it really disturbing how many people are having their careers ruined over petty things that come up on a google search.

"If you want to end the relationship then do it, you don't need anyone's permission but if you think that you can move past and truly forgive something like your actions in a month then your wrong. It will take some time for him to move past the hurt and to truly forgive. 

His actions are hurtful, but it's just him lashing out in his own hurt, it's wrong but entirely understandable. He may well have checked out but he is still giving you a chance to show this is saveable. 

You don't seem to have realized you killed and ended your earlier relationship with your actions, you are now starting from scratch in a new relationship with a person who ultimately distrusts you and feels insecure. I see his actions as simply showing he has options and that you are replaceable, i.e. trying to show that if you stray again he can get someone else. I don't see anything abusive per se, he hasn't made comments directly to you trying to put you down or make you small and i don't see him as using you, he said he would try another relationship with you, and you don't seem to grasp that this isn't easy for him or for you. You seem to think he should be over his little acting out phase by now and he should be the lovey dovey person he was before but it takes years, not a month to fix something like this and even then it never goes away, it will always be a scar on your relationship. 

I would recommend ending this, you don't seem to have the patience and desire to put in the ground work to fix things and it will be a long time to fix it and you could spend those years going after people in clubs and enjoying life until you have matured enough to enter a relationship properly, this isn't a negative attack by the way, you clearly still have some desire for that lifestyle, hence your actions, so get it while you can. Don't close yourself to what you want, you wouldn't be doing him or yourself a favour.

"Yeah I find that hard to believe it's 100% not an option. I've had a lot of abdominal surgeries, on both my bladder and GI tract and my doctors at Mayo have always said that if things get out of hand, and ostomy (urinary or fecal) is by far the best option. I had bladder surgery just 7 weeks ago and had to go through urostomy therapy beforehand on the teeny off chance that they needed to do it during the surgery if things didn't go well.    

Ostomy bags are the preferred option for people with Crohn's or Colitis nowadays that don't respond well to drugs. I've known several and they all say their quality of life is vastly improved. I literally cannot imagine why someone with an otherwise healthy GI tract would be told it's not an option. Malabsorption and risk of infection are pretty easily managed nowadays."

I can imagine a class conversation occurring something like the following...  

* Those were some silly texts you sent me last night, David.
* Oh, what did he say to you?
* Asked what I was wearing.
* (whole class chuckles)
* That's the same way he started with me last week.

* (whole class laughs)
* So, David, who's the lucky girl going to be tonight for your messages?
* Or are you done with the girls and now one of us guys will get lucky?

"You need to talk to your mum directly, imo. Express how much she means to you, and emphasise that associating with your Dad doesn't mean you condone any of his actions. She needs to understand several things:

* That you love her, look up to her, and are absolutely disgusted and angry at your dad for how he treated (and treats) her.

* That you are low-contact with him; he has lost your respect and trust. The fact you love him still doesn't mean you are blind to the fact that he is objectively an asshole.

* It is important to you to maintain a relationship with him on some level because whilst he was clearly an abusive shitty husband, he is a good dad to you, and adds to your life in a positive way.

* It is hurtful to you that she wants to *use* you to punish him, completely disregarding that your father/daughter bond is still important to you.

..


That said, it actually doesn't sound like he does add to your life in any positive way. You haven't given many details on what shitty stuff he did/does to your mom, but he had a decade long affair and you describe him as a horrible narcissist so I'm assuming at least emotionally controlling and abusive.


From an outsiders point of view it seems that you have a relationship with your mom's abuser out of a misplaced sense of obligation. It could even be that it hurts and worries your mom to see her narcissistic ex manipulate you, and that engages with you in order to cause pain to your mom now that he no longer has any way to put her down directly."
"Ok fair enough. 

You can ask your husband if loves your sister, but considering how manipulative he is, I highly doubt he will give you an honest answer. Likely he will gaslight you, turn the argument around on you.

Every big city has one, and they know the ins and outs of tenancy, so they might have some idea of what's going on. Maybe it's some sort of money laundering front or other illegal hijinks? I'd also get a hotel or airbnb if possible as well; this is beyond creepy."
"She's drinking again, definitely, and I don't think you need to catch her in the act or try to get a breathalyser or whatever to prove that. It will make her feel awful and may compound the difficulty in getting her to stop; if you can convince her to trust you to admit this that is a far better route. I understand that is also time-pressured however due to the pregnancy. Maybe set yourself a deadline of a week or so in which you're going to try to foster an environment where she tell you herself before taking that option. 

I imagine the stress and anxiety of the pregnancy, despite it being planned, is the trigger here. 

Sit her down for a serious talk where you don't confront her with your evidence but you tell her that *if* she were drinking again, you hope she knows you would support and help her rather than blame her or leave (if that is true). Ask her how she's feeling about being pregnant - is she worried about any of it? Share some of your worries not related to her alcohol use, just general 'there's so much to do, what if I'm not a good dad' kinda stuff. She probably won't tell you then. 

Then have another conversation a day or two later where you say, ""honestly, all the findings of wine bottles and stuff has panicked me and made me think about how we'd handle it if you had a lapse. I know, intellectually, that a lapse isn't the end of the world and you'd come back from it, but if it happened, what would you like me to do? Who do we call? What treatment do we look into?"" Start making a plan about ""if"" even though you know ""if"" is now. 

She knows about fetal alcohol syndrome. She knows what she's doing may escalate. She's not telling you because she thinks she has it under control and will stop again soon - which is a lie she is telling herself. 

The thing is, if it's a couple of bottles of wine over the course of a few weeks, she hasn't yet returned to physical dependency. But she could if/when this gets worse, and the detox will be incredibly hard on her and the baby. So you do need to act fast, for both of them. 

Give her an opportunity to tell you, if you're sure she isn't drinking a bottle of wine or more *everyday*. You said before that there was a 'semi-intervention' which helped her quit - can you do something like that again? Things that helped us in the past are often useful when they are repeated. 

And definitely tell the ob/gyn and midwife if you have one. If she's drinking her nutritional needs and the needs of the baby will be altered, and they will be able to handle that at least a little. 

Good luck. There's no one way through this. Remember that a lapse doesn't mean starting again because recovery is a journey - a lapse is getting off the train halfway to your destination. She can get back on. BUT you need to intervene quickly in a way that will work for her to stop her getting on that other train going in the opposite direction. "

Tell them you either need help getting your sister out of there, or suggestions for how you can protect her in the bathroom, on hikes, and at night.

I don't know what advice I have for you. But from your post I can tell you are not a shallow, awful person. You love your husband very much. It shows in your words. I can see why you couldn't go through with the open relationship.

"By the way OP, there is no reason why you can't be so invested in your patients, especially one that you've known for over a year.

I read that you're considering quitting and working at a facility instead. This is not a bad idea, and exposing yourself to more difficult/stressful situations when surrounded by others will help you learn to cope and accept. But(!) watch out for the jaded co-workers who will shrug and not give a shit at the end of the day. Don't let their attitudes compromise your standard of care and the love that you share with your patients.

"NOPE. Look, I'm not kink shaming, he's not a bad person for being into watersports by any means, but any responsible member of the wider kink community understands the importance of active and informed consent - which was **entirely** absent from his actions. 

Sure, he may have been shamed into suppressing his fetish. That still doesn't give him the right to perform these (or **any** acts) without asking them if they're cool with it before hand. 

The problem isn't his fetish, it's his actions. I'd be saying the same thing if he performed a ""vanilla"" sex act without OP's consent. "

"They don't for iMessage which is probably what she's referring to. Generally that's how people tell they've been blocked. I'm not sure if you mean well, but it is a very bad idea to give advice on something you're not qualified to. This is an incredibly high stakes game where she already feels threatened and you're telling her to make herself blind to the only warning sign she'll get (him getting threatening in messages). Please think first. This is not just me saying this, this is literally what security experts recommend- NOT to block, just to stop replying and have someone else screen the messages for threats. It's not about being a pushover, it's about staying aware so you can protect yourself."

"You were thanked in person. That is worth 1000x more valuable than a Facebook post.

Also worth remembering that there are plenty of people who would be offended by their family members posting about money like that on Facebook. Many people I know, especially older people, would consider that sort of arrangement and a gift a private one. It's possible your parents are not committing an oversight but actually just assume the 'polite' thing to do is different from what you think it is.

You are being thin skinned, and there is no way to address this that won't be deeply hurtful to your parents. I'd strongly advise you not to taint their enjoyment of this wonderful gift because you want other people to know how generous you are."
"Seriously, if a 19 year old man was making comments about how a 15 year old ""looked older"" and stuff its thought to be creepy. But when this chick does it, its just flirting? And in the first post he talks about how she was touching him sexually, which is inappropriate. And then she made fun of him after the fact, when she knew exactly what she was doing? And everybody is saying she is just flirting and to pursue this? I feel like I am in the Twilight Zone... This is how abusive relationships start."

"I think you should just avoid talking about Emma with the friend who is annoyed by your affection for her, and keep a few things in mind to keep yourself in check:

 if doing these things is helping you be a better you, keep doing them but do them for you, not just because Emma does them.

"You have not provided any evidence that your husband **isn't** interested in you. I read your original post and honestly you were not that receptive to the comments people made. the fundamental problem is that you do not feel confident and that is affecting your marriage. For a lot of people, improving outward appearance improves confidence levels. By rejecting any suggestions to maybe update or revisit your clothing style or haircut or skincare regimen, you either are happy with how you look (because if you weren't you would be more receptive to change it), OR you have accepted the fact that you old and you plan on being miserable forever about it.

Nothing, and I mean nothing, about the relationship you described is a ""friends with benefits"" situation. You're living with your boyfriend.

No. We mourn the relationship, feel depressed and angry and bitter for a while, and then we pick ourselves up and we fall in love with someone else.  Definitely not ""random people [we] don't like."" My heart was broken when I was 19 and again at 20 by the same person, really broken, and I was devastated.

"Yeah, I saw that in another comment just after I posted. 


Honestly, they sound (your boyfriend included) like nasty, cruel, mean people. 

Pranks are meant to be funny to everyone. Like hello, have they ever watched Punk'd as kids? Everyone finds it funny, not just the prankers. 


What they did wasn't a prank. It was bullying someone for their own sick laughs. 


I couldn't personally be with someone as cruel as your boyfriend. What if you're the next victim of his ""pranks?"" He can say he'd never do that to you, but I'm sure that poor guy thought his friends would never hurt, humiliate, embarrass and cause him injury. 

Your boyfriend and his friends aren't good people. They're cruel bullies."
"He's done the opposite of a creepy thing. It's not at all weird for a 22yr old man to find a 16yr old girl attractive, and while an actual relationship at that age with that gap may have been icky, he literally recognized exactly this fact, backed off and waited. Now your age gap is perfectly normal. Your friend is likely jealous. I understand that your fiance is feeling down, it's a serious accusation and no one likes that shit levelled at them for no reason. It's likely also why she chose this."
"I do that sometimes. When I'm at work, when I'm at school, when I'm at home - that's just how stuff works for me. Most of the time, I'll be just dicking around doing nothing and texting random people of facebook (too broke to actually text), whether said people actually are online/do have the time to reply or not.

Then someone comes along, or I am given a task to do, and I forget all about the texts, because they weren't actually important, just a way of killing the time for me. This happens a lot, because that's just how my uni (and work too) works - half of the time the classes are boring and not important for me, but often we just get a task that's interesting and then I'll just go straight for the task and ignore my phone completely. No matter how important the discussion I was having was. Even if I have just asked a question.

Does your husband only do this when he's at work, or all the time? You say he has a lot of time to just do whatever, with no work assigned, but it could be very likely that he just gets some things to do during the day that each take maybe half an hour or forty minutes. And he just pays attention to the worktask at hand, instead of his phone, when that happens. So he doesn't text back."

"It really wasn't a huge thing, though. 

I played basketball in high school. One day I got hit in the face by a center's elbow. It bled a lot. My nose was broken. Didn't go to the doctor because really what can be done about a broken nose? It healed, my already crooked septum was now even more crooked. I spent years 16-20 with a nearly constant stuffy nose and had some trouble breathing. 

At 20 I said, ""You know what? Fuck this shit, I wanna get this fixed. Went to a doctor, he said ""Yup, you have an insanely deviated septum. We can fix that with a septoplasty."" About a week later I got it done, about 2 weeks of recovery (wasn't too bad, actually), and within 4 months it was like it never happened at all. 

It was about as major as getting a wart lasered off. "
"I think you might be misunderstanding -- OP did not tell her boyfriend about the job, she told the people doing the hiring about her boyfriend and they hired him without further assessing his qualifications.  That means she's put herself out on a limb here, since if he doesn't work out her credibility with people in her industry who do hiring is on the line.  I was more thankful to the people who pointed me in the direction of my current company than her boyfriend was to her, and those people did not do anything to facilitate me getting the job other than tell me the company existed."
"Please consider that there is someone out there -- possibly even someone you know -- who is as much smarter than you as you are than GF's mother.  Do you think this guy shudders at the prospect of being in your presence, or does he accept you as a good, friendly person?

His inability to recognize his own wealth and mistakenly identifying an average middle class family as poor suggests that he's more judgmental and elitist than he probably realizes.
"OP, you bought her the most boring, generic Gifts For Ladies! imaginable - flowers, dance lessons, and a bunch of stuff from Lush. But it took you a long time, so to you that's a great gift.
Your GF, on the other hand, remembered something personal you told her weeks or months ago and turned that into a present for you. But it didn't take her very long to buy it, so to you that's a crap gift.

The issue here is not that your love language is gifting, or that your girlfriend is bad at gifting. (She's clearly great at it!) The issue is that you have *your own somewhat arbitrary standard* for judging the quality of a gift that she doesn't know. If you really want her to improve the perceived quality of the gifts by your own personal metric, you need to tell her the metric you're grading her on. But that's going to be a terrible conversation, and frankly you're probably better off just re-assessing your metric."
She doesn't want a party and you're throwing a surprise one? This is a bad idea.

If she really believed Sarah was real, she would've been happy to have that dinner (and when Sarah didn't show up, she would've been convinced Sarah was just out late or gardening or something). But the reason she is lying might not be malicious as much as her wanting to feel valued and capable. But yeah, I would talk about it with her.

I was busy during the day watching my sons and didn't see any further posts but my wife saw the comment and took great offense to it. She made mention of how pissed off she was with my co-worker to which I read the comment and advised that it was made in jest even if it wasn't funny.

Ok, you wanted a female perspective.  Your wife is completely justified to be this angry over your sexist friend.  For you to brush it off as, ""oh well, it wasn't funny but whatever"" sends her the message that it's ok to equate your wife to a piece of machinery and his joke just ""wasn't funny""

&gt; I also let my wife know that I was not going to start an internet argument with my co-worker especially over facebook.

"As far as college goes it could be beneficial for OP to try and get emancipated, though. Otherwise he will be required to declare his father's income on a FAFSA form and will likely not be elligible for financial aid beyond unsubsidized loans. There are only a handful of ways you can be considered independent as far as FAFSA is concerned but living on your own, paying all your own bills, and having no contact with your parents is not one of them. To pursue the emancipation route you must have been emancipated before turning 18. This still might not be the right choice for OP, especially considering the kinds of things /u/staticshocktart mentions above (I honestly don't know much about what the process involves), but it is important to be aware of."

There is a big difference from walking on an overgrown hiking trail in the woods at night vs. an infrequently used country road (walking polls??-even if its dirt or gravel in a woods and uphill.....come on she's 30 not 60).  

All that being said - If you would like to have a good relationship with this woman you are going to have to work on letting this kind of stuff go.  This isn't to be mean - but to provide constructive feedback:   you seem to have some major boundary issues if you think you can make 30 yr old stranger do what you want (under the premise of good intentions) just because they moved down the road from you.  Bad blood between neighbors can get ugly - just let this go.

"Lying to you is obviously the problem here OP. Frankly, she's probably lucky she didn't do this to someone less tolerant and accepting than you are.

She really tried to discuss biological children with you? How the fuck does that work? She isn't even in contact with her family so like her sister could donate the egg and you the sperm or something...

I'm so sorry OP, but this is the kind of thing she should have disclosed within the first 4 dates or something! Not after 4 years! I have some things I've done in my life that are deal breakers for people and when I was actively dating and I liked someone enough to see them more than a few times, I disclosed it. Because it is an issue for some people and that's ok.

Do not let anyone tell you that you're a terrible person for ending things because of an enormous lie. If you have discussed children it could have come up then. There would be a point in your lives together where it would come up!! What the hell did she think would happen?!"

The next time he says, threatens, or does anything remotely violent, call the police. Every. Single. Time. Without fail. 

If you can't make your parents deal with him, then they can't stop you from making those calls. 

Maybe he can get better, or maybe he will choose to keep being an asshole who violates everyone else's rights. That is up to him.

"It doesn't matter why she thinks it, if she doesn't want to do it, she should not be coerced into it. Right or wrong doesn't matter in these situations. This is simple sexual incompatibility. "
"Yeah, sorry, that sounds like a whole lot of horseshit to justify you doing whatever the hell you want and to never inconvenience yourself.

All those people you cut out at the drop of a hat? They have feelings. You are just as much a part of their life as they are yours. 

So while *you* and my boyfriend see ""Jack and I agreed to go camping a week ago. Now Jack is going to a funeral. Jack has no regard for my feelings and is not worth my time. Can't he see that we planned this weeks ago? Can't he see that I was looking forward to this?""...

Jack (and the rest of the world) sees: ""I agreed to go on a camping trip with [x]. But I could never have foreseen my aunt dying. I am incredibly hurt that he can't understand that this is a pressing emergency that I must tend to, even though we had prior plans."" 

Sometimes people fuck up. Sometimes people make mistakes. I know there are times where I have acted in a way that I regret. People aren't perfect. That doesn't mean you should cut them out. My best friend? I've known her since we were 12. I *hated* her at first. The first few years we were friends weren't great. She often was very selfish. But overall she did a lot of good, things, too. And I knew that she looked to me as a friend, and me dropping her would be incredibly hurtful. Now, over a decade later? She is like a sister to me. She has grown immensely, and proven time and time again that she is wonderful person who will bend over backwards to help me out. If I had cut her out when we were dumb teenagers, I would've missed out on a lifelong friend *and* hurt her incredibly so. And if *she* had cut *me* out? Again, I would've missed out on a lifelong friend and wondered what the hell was so horrible about me that I was unforgivable. 

People have feelings. Yes, even the people you cut out. So think twice next time you do that. Because to you, it makes your life easier. And there is nothing wrong with that. But to them? You could've just ruined someone's day, week, or hell, even month. Maybe you just scarred them in a way that will never recover. Because you just showed them that in your eyes, they are unlovable. Unforgivable. Absolutely nothing to you. And *yes*, that *is* void of empathy. That *is* callous, shallow, and cold. 

Obviously some people should be cut out. But we're not talking about actually abusive people here. We're talking about a father that asked his adult son to pay rent. A friend who skipped out on plans to attend a funeral. Friends that ""didn't invite him out often enough."" *None* of those are legitimate and excusable reasons to cut family and long-term friends out of your life. You can still do it. But don't be upset when you have nobody left because nobody wants to deal with someone that void of empathy and understanding."

"&gt; I need to take care of those things before I start looking into dating. Just waiting for the right time.

That time is now! I'm not saying you should go all in on dating, but make sure you start making the right steps to get there. Broaden your social circles, make sure you go to places where you can actually meet women and just get comfortable in social situations.

Start laying the groundwork!"
"Also a woman. Also didn't like my nose when I was younger (thought it looked too fat/round). It wasn't to the extent of OP's daughter but now I haven't thought of it in years. 

OP and his family need to consider that a bad nose job can ruin your daughter's face for life. (Have you seen the show Botched?) I don't think he should allow this until *she is an adult, done growing, and has completed therapy about the issue first*. However if/when OP does agree with this they need to see a reputable plastic surgeon. Absolutely not a discount surgeon, one who isn't well established in this country, or someone that you haven't extensively researched. Not only can she end up looking awful, it can impact her voice and breathing. A bad nose job is not always fixable even if she goes to the best most expensive doctors; the goal may just to be to make her look more (not completely) normal. There is also always the risk of dangerous complications. "
"they're not very common in the US, they end up being exotic produce, as laughable as that may seem in other places."
"Ugh, she's the worst kind of poly person - the kind who uses being poly as an excuse to lie, cheat, and manipulate. She's the kind that ends up shunned by the poly community because all she does is create drama and play the victim.

Poly, mono, however you end up identifying, you can do so much better than this girl. You sound like an honest, decent, empathetic guy with healthy boundaries. Take some time off to heal, then find a girl who shares those qualities. "
"I think you should just go ahead and tell her now, just be upfront and honest. If it's something she is cool with then great, but if she is not cool with it, then if you tell her now you will save a lot of heartbreak and hurt feelings for you both later. 

Don't be surprised if she is surprised and wants to be 'just friends' at first...it might just take her a little while to warm up to the idea."
Is it possible he made special accomadations for you because you are that much better at your job than your coworkers?
"That's a reasonable concern and you've done right in your part. If she has a burgeoning mental illness, her mom can now step in. What's more likely is that she's handling your engagement very, very badly. Watching your bestie experience real love and get married feels like going to a funeral for some. All they see is how they're losing a friend and how alone they are. She sounds very immature, jealous and shortsighted. Her behavior is more likely to end these friendships than their marriages are.

Either way, is this someone you want in your future? Do you want her vibes circlig your wedding, talking to guests at your reception? Probably not. Seems best to let her go unless she comes back with some serious apologies."
"*please be a troll please be a troll please be a troll*

If you are not trolling: you and your family are white (or brown, black, yellow, red, purple, whatever) trash. The rest of the civilised world does not behave as your family does. Your mother was exceptionally vulgar. You were exceptionally vulgar. 

&gt; I don't know what to do about her behavior.

Learn from it and emulate her exceptional grace when confronted with a ridiculous set of circumstances. Really, if you want to better yourself and this woman is still willing to have anything to do with you -- hit the bookstore for some etiquette books, polish yourself up, and apologise to her and treat her wonderfully and hope some of what she has rubs off on you. It's probably the best chance you'll have in your life to not turn out like your mother, y'know?"
Be careful man. Be wary of your surroundings. You never know what crazy people will do
"Fat shaming is shaming people for being fat. That's all it is. There might be this narrative you have in your mind of an obese person complaining that it's all DNA while wolfing down a cheese pizza.

"This. At three months, she still doesn't even really know this guy. The ""he's the only one for me"" attitude this early on makes me wonder if there are some underlying mental health or codependency issues.

"are you really each other's '""love of [your] life"" when you ""figured we'd be able to make out, date"" other people during the break. Wow. Just wow.  are u fucking kidding me. You fucked up. Just because you looked at the fun your friends were having. Honestly you should prepare yourself for him not trusting you or the slow decline of your relationship, or better yet him actually breaking up with you. If u wanted to be single, be single but don't ask your poor boyfriend ""hey, i'm gonna date a couple dudes for a while, but i'll still be yours at the end of the day!"" *giggles* *smiles*. No. Like others said: you wanted to have your cake and eat it too"
"Have you ever heard of stereotype threat? It's when a positive stereotype is put on someone or a group of people and although it may seem positive, that stereotype has a negative effect on the person/group of people. In no way shape or form am I trying to downplay the hardships your race is facing, I'm a minority myself, I sympathize and am outraged at the treatment. I just also want you to also realize that there are other minority races that, although it may not seem like it, suffer from stereotypes and prejudice. Asians are seen as smart and this can impact them by always feeling they have to be some genius when maybe they want to go into an art-field versus a STEM field. The societal pressure from that is incredible. Or have you ever heard of yellow fever? Asian women are still being portrayed as some oriental sex kitten and some don't know whether their boyfriends love them or their skin. All I want you to get from this is that each race has their own hardships and you should never downplay it, that's a root of the problem. I understand that what your race is going through right now is terrible, but also understand that it's hard for other minorities if people keep saying ""oh your stuff isn't bad at all"". We know it's obviously not as bad, but the stuff we deal with still isn't going away, gets compounded and can negatively affect us in ways people don't realize. "
"So you manage to snag a girl you really like, then ignore her for a week?

"Yes.  The primary determiner in what is fair is whether or not it works for all parties involved.  If it works for her to contribute more than 50%, then it works.  "
"It's not either or. Human trafficking is rampant in countries where prostitution is legal, in similar or even often higher levels then in other countries."
"Try 'porn is publicly posted for viewing and it can damage my reputation at work to be involved with a porn star.' You might not like it, but those dynamics exist, especially in more conservative areas . Or how about 'My girlfriend didn't tell me for a year that she used to do porn.'  Or even just the very very basic 'Our sexual morals don't align.'"
I know someone who did that.  Her husband had an affair and moved out to live with the other woman. She continued to have sex with him because the sex had always been awesome.  After about 9 months things came unglued with the other woman and he wanted to come back home.  She dumped him telling him he was only good enough for a lay but not a relationship.  Well played.  I wish I'd had that kind of gumption but I was too hurt when it happened to me.  
"&gt;I want to know how it feels to have that kind of connection.

The connection doesn't come from the physical contact.  The physical contact is the result of a connection.  You won't get what you're after by paying a woman to get naked for 15 minutes so you can use her body."

I have never talked badly about him to, or in front of my son. I also have never done anything to make his life harder. I've gone to bat for him many times. I've helped him with things, and his assumption that I am only doing this to hurt him comes from my mother's manipulation and a crack head pedophile who was obsessed with ruining my life. I have never done anything to him except standing up for myself and leaving him. "

"I also think that some honesty is in order on when exactly he stopped seeing other people and whether or not it's true that he didn't sleep with any of them while seeing OP. Since he did lie then, OP needs to know if he's still lying now Jr. She wants to rebuild trust."

"I have 2 sons who are the same way.The are 15 and 13. They hate playing team sports. I used to try to encourage them to do soccer and baseball, but it always ended up in disaster.

So we came to a middle ground. I want them both to have some type of **physical** activity that that do regularly, because it's healthy to get outdoors an move your body. My youngest discovered that he likes biking, my oldest basically just takes long walks around town and goes hiking. I'm fine with that.

In terms of other, non sport activities. I tell my kids they can try lessons in whatever they want (within reason). But once they sign up for lessons, they have to finish the whole course. One of my kids signed up for an art class, but didn't really like it. I still made him complete the 8 weeks. I think it's important to finish what you start, you know?

So far, my oldest likes photography and my youngest is taking music lessons (and is really good!). 

Anyway, there are plenty of non sport activities that your daughter may enjoy. Ask her what she is interested in, and go from there. She likes video games? There are video game design courses for kids. Just an example.

"28M doesn't sound healthy at all.

I assume you still have at least a few years of school left, whereas he's working and if similar to other 28 year olds, his friends are all getting engaged and married around him. 


There's nothing wrong with being single and not having a boyfriend. You don't need to find someone just to have someone. Find someone who really likes you and truly appreciates you and makes you a better person. If neither of these guys are it then keep looking. "
Yes that's basically the facts of life.  You cannot unring that bell.
Exactly! A deposit for full cleaning up front. 
"It sounds like she just has a more positive outlook on life than you... why are you faulting her for that? Calling her ""the golden child"" just makes it sound like you're jealous. It doesn't sound like she purposely attempted to make your parents like her more than you. It just sounds like she's a nice person in general.

You shouldn't have to be forced to be a Maid of Honor if you really don't want to be, but let her down as easy as possible. Does she have a best friend? Maybe gently suggest that her best friend would be a better MOH since she can be there for her more since you're across the country.

Have you ever talked with her about the fact that you feel like she took over your family? Or did you just move away and hope she would stop becoming close with your family?

I would feel a little weird if my dad walked one of my friends down the aisle, if he hadn't walked me down the aisle first, so I can't fault you on that one. Did she already ask your dad and he said yes? Or are you just assuming this will be what happens?"
*hugs back* 
"And I may very well be wrong - like I said, that's speculation, and I don't know either of you. I guess it disturbs me that you said in another comment that he is often rough with his words, and that his response when you tried to talk with him about his substantial change in perspective was to tear your character to shreds and list off all the ways you're supposedly a terrible wife.

"Just because she wants it doesn't mean OP has to oblige. There's no lost love between them and outside of civility, op has no obligation to Brigit. And really, there's no point in pursuing that kind of relationship when one party refuses to participate. Brigit will have to find a maternal figure elsewhere. "
"I'm concerned about how you brought up a valid issue (sharing a home with your partner shouldn't be concidered a sacrifise) and he *explained* that you were wrong. It's common in relationships that the older partner use their apparent life experience and wisdom to explaine how the world works, which always just happens to coincide with what they want. Do you often change your mind after your husband talks to you?

Also, yes some people have a greater beed for privacy. But that's something they compromise with *themselves* to have something else they want (a healthy relationship), and is not something their partner barters with them to get them to do. He may be right about needing more privacy than most, but he's absolutly wrong that it means that you have to buy you're way into his home by being childfree. But the most bullshit is that he is sacrifising something by bringing a loving person into his childrens life. That's not a sacrifise in any way, shape or form. That's you giving him something good."

"If you go through with the pregnancy, I think you need to do so under the assumption that all you can expect from him is legally mandated child support, and that even getting that may entail a fight.  He's already made his decision: fatherhood is not something he wants right now.  Sure, it would be nice if he were more understanding this isn't that simple for you...but if you two were on the same page like that, there probably wouldn't have been a breakup in the first place.  Sort out what you want for yourself, and if that's the baby, have a session with a lawyer so you can lay out what his obligations are and have a neutral party in place to deal with that in case he doesn't want further contact with you."
What about children losing their mom? A parent should put aside their grief and support their kids. That's how having kids works. You put the kids first. Only shitty parents leave their kids alone after their other parent dies to go alone holiday with a new partner.

"&gt; You won't have real intimacy with a prostitute. You'll be able to put your penis inside of a woman, and she'll moan and do all the 'right' things, but it won't be real. You won't be able to snuggle with her after, kiss passionately, take your time and then try again, and again. She won't look into your eyes with longing, nothing she does will have real emotion behind it. Sex is so much more than putting your thing in a hole.
&gt; It also costs less to find a sexual partner than to repeatedly pay for prostitutes.
&gt; Take the money you'd spend on a sex worker, and spend it on a gym membership, better clothes, or counseling. Improve your life and your confidence. Figure your shit out.

"There is nothing good about this relationship. End it now, before you get used to this treatment and eventually feel it's all you deserve. I would go into detail, but you honestly seem to already know what is wrong here. Be single, or be with somebody that respects you enough to tell his ""friend"" that her behavior is unacceptable. The fact that they are supposedly best friends, but she seems out to get you, is a huge red flag. "

Edit: I'm also trying to impress on her the idea that she is letting this obnoxious person dictate her life. Life is too short to hang out with people that make your life miserable."

"""If you keep touching my (beard/chest), I'm going to think you want me to kiss you.""

If she doesn't deny interest, ask her out again. Sometimes people have not thought about a friend in a romantic context, and need a few days or a few weeks to process it. Unless she's exceptionally confident, she may not know how to reinitiate the conversation.  If she seems like an otherwise good person, and has suddenly changed her behavior to be more flirty after finding out you like her, it seems worth double checking this before assuming she's leading you on to get attention.

If she says no again, or denies interest, then she's leading you on. /u/NerdCrush has great advice for this scenario."

"They care about you and they're worried, that's what's going on with them. Your husband has convinced you to make enormous sacrifices for him and he gives you absolutely nothing in return. His children are not your children, they already have a mother who has primary custody, and pretending that they're yours is only going to make her dislike you more."
"I agree with /u/staticshocktart, just wanted to add my own anecdotal confirmation of the way this played out for me.  My mom is a drama queen, also always on facebook trying to make her life appear awesome and exciting and like a loving, doting, mother (hah).  I put up with her crap all these years because it seemed easier to turn the other cheek.  When I got married, it became all about her (though carefully designed to make her look just very supportive and involved).  She made promises she didn't keep, only offered (demanded) to pay for my dress because my dad offered to pay for the wedding, talked about the ""mistakes"" I was making regarding planning with everyone she could corner.  When she came to the wedding she tried to be the cool mom and got a little too handsy with some of my guests, and was clearly putting on a show for my dad (who didn't care, of course).  She didn't make a scene, thankfully.

Then she started showing up at my house randomly because it is on a destination street (shops, etc).  When I asked her to text first it became a long string of sappy pictures on facebook about how hard it is to be a mother when your children don't care, are too busy for you, etc.  Thankfully she moved around that time. 

Then I got pregnant.  I laid it out, very strict boundaries and told her we are done if she crossed them.  She was good(ish) for a few months, until the baby came.  I had told her I didn't want anyone coming for the first week, she showed up (from across the country) two hours after I got back from the hospital.  She paraded my baby around, and even took him at five days old down the street in 100 degree weather for hours with no bottle, diapers, or phone.  My husband had to scour the neighborhood to finally find her as I was still recovering from, you know, birth.  I didn't leave her alone with the baby again, which she seemed fine with.

Three weeks later, she blocked me on facebook and sent me a letter.  She laid out very clearly how she realizes I have always hated her, including a list of ""proof."" There was a whole slew of stuff from me getting married three years prior, such as not picking the dress she wanted me to wear, not spending enough time with her on my wedding day, not thanking her enough or getting enough pictures with her, etc.  There was much more, and I realized she just kept this constant tally of all the ways I obviously hate her in the back of her head, even when we are having benign and even relatively pleasant interactions.  

She then sent all my baby pictures and such to my dad, said she birthed me but was not my mom, and that she would be removing herself from my life for my sake.  Her door would always be open if *I* wanted to put forth the effort of having a good relationship with her. 

Throughout this whole thing, I was told by my brother and other family to just put up with her, she's not malicious, she's my mom, etc.  I spent months and months agonizing over whether to cut her out or not.  That letter just solidified that I had tried hard enough, she is *always* the victim, and will find offense at nothing so she can be upset and have a pity party.   My brother, who was always close to her, and my other friends and family now see how much better it is for me to be no contact.  If anyone brings it up, I just say that it's between the two of us and I will not discuss it.  Two years later and it is largely a non-issue. 

I am not saying to go no contact with your mom if that is not what you feel is right.  But also don't let others dissuade you if you feel it is right.  I never had the strength and resolve to cut her off until I had my own child, and now I look at him and know I never want to have to explain why grandma is acting weird, or that she lies, or that she makes promises she won't keep because it's all about looking good in the moment.  I don't want her to affect him the way she affected me, not even in the slightest.  

If you aren't wanting to cut her out, I would suggest at least making very strict boundaries that are VERY clear with no room for ""misunderstandings.""  Be equally clear in your consequences, and stick by them.  If it works, at least you have a foundation for future interactions and situations such as when you have a family.  If it doesn't, then you know you tried and she knowingly crossed your boundaries and has to live with the predetermined consequences.  "
You seem very not nice. So he likes K Pop. I do not see the big deal. Some people like Journey and Toto.
Actually the divorce statistics of people who get married after six years are considerably worse than those get married after 2-3 years.
"Unfortunately, there is really nothing OP can do on a legal level. I'm a psych nurse and pregnant women cannot be forced into treatment unless they are a danger to themselves or others ( and damage to the fetus does not count, in the eyes of the law). CPS can be on standby for the birth, but the mother cannot be forced to stop any substance while pregnant. In a few states, drinking alcohol, while visibly pregnant, is a misdemeanor. Even in those states, the woman cannot be made to seek treatment or stop drinking.

I suggest OP contact social services and lawyer. He needs to  gather as much proof as possible, in order to be used in the future custody hearing ( it is best for the child that they divorce, that child needs a safe environment). "
"Yeah, apparently my marriage isn't as great as I thought. It's never been perfect, we never craved for a perfect marriage (boring), but I never thought we were in such a crisis, and it hit me hard. Everything did.

edit: clarification"
"I've been over there for an hour now, it's been mindblowing. Someone else also suggested it. Thank you so very much."
