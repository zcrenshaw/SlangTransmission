"Yeah, except that you went to go stay there when you and your husband had a fight. For no reason, because your home is empty.

You can see why that's upsetting to him and looks shady, right?

You two get in a fight, in large part because of a drastic change causing you to spend significantly more time at work, talk with him less, and spend less time with him.

So he goes to stay with his daughter (or whatever), and you go to sleep at a male colleague's house.

It doesn't matter that nothing is going to happen and that other people are also staying there. It LOOKS shady, and it's understandable for him to be upset (about this and about your new job), and it sounds here like you dismiss all of his concerns as being crazy and unfounded, when they are neither."
"Good advice, thank you."
"He's also making it sound like if she doesn't forgive him, that means she values their relationship less than he does--the same relationship that he disrespected by crossing all kinds of boundaries in the first place."
"EXACTLY!!!!! Men do this ALL the time. CONSTANTLY. They don't want advice, just to vent.

What's the only difference? Women are TRAINED from fucking childhood on how to emotionally support everyone and anyone, and made to feel as if they are rotten selfish horrible individuals and bad unworthy people if they fail at doing so.

So women do this for men as if it's second nature, so naturally that men don't even notice it's happening. And then men turn around and bitch when it's their turn about how it makes no sense and they can't be expected to understand how to do it. "
"JK Rowling said her character of Gilderoy Lockhart was based off a man she knew. She said in an interview he was so full of himself she was certain he never made the connection and was probably going around saying he was the inspiration for Dumbledore. 

I presume people like this are why the proverb ""pride goes before a fall"" exists."
OP sounds about that age as well. 
"Maybe read because that's not what happened or what we're arguing?

&gt;his mother came in and started calling him disrespectful and immature for not calling her throughout the day to tell her where he was or what he was doing

That's possessiveness and ridiculous to ask of an adult son. If she wants him to move out or pay rent, that's her decision, but if anyone is being immature or disrespectful in this situation, it's the mother."
"&gt; That's a long time ago and a lot has changed.

Yeah, I'm kind of amused by OP's wife saying ""politicians were nicer."" Sorry, you couldn't pay me to go back to the Bush administration. No marriage equality? No Lily Ledbetter Act? Hard pass. "
"*Another part of the country, not another country completely. :P"
"If your solution is to run away to your sisters and close yourself off to any communication at all about this, then regardless of if you decide you can get passed this, you two shouldn't be getting married for a very long time as you don't seem to be ready for that kind of a relationship."
"Even in the best situations, having a child takes up most of your time and attention.  My wife has only recently been able to reconnect with some of her friends, and that is with supportive husband who helps out.  So yea, I mean you are just friends, she has a newborn.  It isnt about you.

Also, its their relationship.  You dont have all the details, you dont know what their life is like so but out frankly.  Just let her know you will be there for her at any time, but its not your problem to fix.

"
"I understand that, but she's your employee. You pay her for a service. You don't owe her anything.

What you should do is talk to your wife about boundaries, and see if she's willing to compromise. Think really hard about what you said, try to remember, and try to understand where she's coming from.

She's probably feeling insecure because she's pregnant with your second, maybe not feeling great about her body, and you getting close to the hot nanny while she's away on business. What exactly did you say, man? "
"Seriously OP listen to this. My boyfriend has paid for most expenses when we go out because he's been making more than double what I make and I was scraping by paycheck to paycheck. And he still wanted to do nice things I simply couldn't afford. 

I started a new job and he still *wants* to pay for most things. But he's starting to let me pay more because we draw the same base salary now. However I have $200k in student loan debt (yay law school!) and he has none. But I *appreciate* him and tell him thank you *every* time he has paid. And tell him explicitly that I appreciate it when he's so generous to me. I am by no means owed this. It would be entirely fair if he asked we go to 50/50 and I'm happy now that I can afford so spoil him a bit (he doesn't know it but he will be getting a $300 bottle of scotch as a special splurge from me to say thank you soon).

Who pays should be fair and proportional as a starting point. Equal splits are generally the starting point. But if one out-earns the other significantly it's totally fair to deviate from that. By no means is the man required to pay. Nor should it be expected. To be treated to dates is a gift, not an expectation and it should be met with exceptional gratitude.

You're right to not blow your one time gift all on her. Save it. Invest it. Have a rainy day fund for emergencies. If you always significantly out-earned her, that's one thing. But you don't. In an era when women seek equality that includes a willingness to split date costs and absolutely living expenses. If the fair split of bills means a place one of you really doesn't want to live and they can afford more and want more, they pay the difference IMO. So if the max she could afford is $500 on rent, and you want the $1500 place, you pay the balance. Otherwise it's an equal split.

I would never be tied down to someone who could afford to split rent and bills but refused. No way. And I want to always contribute my fair share because as a strong woman I can contribute and WILL contribute to my living expenses. That's feminism. That's equality. "
"When I was seeing a therapist while with my ex she pressured me over the span of 2 months to leave him.  

Then he came for a group visit and not halfway through the visit she was pressuring me to undo all the boundaries she'd been personally helping me set with him.  By the end I was the one being stubborn and unreasonable according to her.

I quit both of them but damn.  I never felt so alienated and betrayed."
Wouldn't be surprised if your brother was a Red Piller...
This. Stay on the dark side until the divorce is finalized. Then go find Yoda in the Dagobah system.
"I was going to respond with this. If you make it to 27 and think that it's acceptable to say those kinds of things, you lacked some serious guidance in your formative years. The children and Iris should all feel embarrassed. Their own behaviour embarrassed them, not OP. "
"I come from a large family with a lot of kids. My uncle did this at his wedding, it was more fun for the kids and the parents.  Seeing that OP has done as such, the brother needs to tone it down and realize there is a compromise in place.  To push it further is downright rude. "
"Does it really matter if he knows you're ignoring him? You're not together. You're not even friends. You don't owe him courteousness. 

Just wait until things are completely sorted out and he has no way to dispute your ownership of the dog."
"First, your friend isn't too bright. Becky is basic. No one wants to be Becky. Ever. And in the song, as you know, ""Becky with the good hair"" was the side chick. Not something I'd be proud to be.

More importantly, I'd ask your friend WTF she meant. I'd interpret it as her trying to one up you and bringing race into it by the ""good hair"" thing. I know it's a lyric, but still. "
"I mean, hell, even if she did say ""we're done"" he goes off and sleeps with another woman that same night? He cared that little for the person currently pregnant with his kid?"
How did you accidentally text her all day and invite her to your room? 
"I'm in the same boat at 16. What really helped me was getting a job. Even though most of my coworkers are 5+ years older than me, they're all my friends and I've been significantly less lonely since I've met them. 

I tried clubs and all that jazz but nothing connected me with people like my job.  My PM's are always open to talk :) "
"* became annoyed and scratched you
* drew blood
* ignoring you
* plays with toys you bought her
* wandering the streets without a key or phone

Is she a cat?"
"&gt;  I told her that our parents gave me life for 18 years but she gave me a lifetime. 

How wonderful!"
Oof. My ex husband used to blame me for bruising easily. Gtfo. Now. 
"I'm inclined to believe that this is not the first time you've been threatened by him, just the first time you thought he was serious. Get him off the lease, change the locks, and buy a puppy that will love you (and bananas). "
"She cheated on you, blamed you, and while you were trying to fix things she cheated on you every single fucking day she went to work with him. It wasn't just that she slept with him ""two"" more times, she kept on having what she had with him. 

Divorce her, move on with your life, take care of your kids, but just move on and find some happiness. 

She's just a piece of shit. Flush her. "
"I lost my husband a year ago. I am now in a new relationship with a fellow widower. I've noticed I treat him so much better than I did my husband. And I know it's because I know the pain of losing someone forever and having so many regrets. Never again. I never thought I missed the sound of snoring. But I get so teary eyed when I wake up before him and I hear him snore. Music to my ears. 

Hold on to your wife if you truly love her... because if you lose her you want to live with as few regrets as possible. "
"especially with the classic line ""I love that you're not one of those girls who wears tons of makeup"" when they don't realize how much effort it takes to look ""natural"" a lot of the time.."
"The first time I met an ex's parents, their first words were, ""thank goodness you're not Black."" So yeah, some people are idiots. "
"You could also look up the charity 'Mankind', who specialise in working with male victims of sexual abuse. From your description of your mum's friends behaviour, it sounds like you were groomed and manipulated and this organisation will be very used to dealing with the complexities surrounding that, and the particular way it may have effected you as a boy/man. 

Look them up to see if they have an office local to you. In my experience, their waiting lists are usually shorter than a GP referral to general counselling and they are exactly the specialists in the issues you're experiencing. "
I've asked her to consider staying in the house we rent currently whilst I take up cheap hospital accommodation - but she doesn't want to live apart. 
I know and it is.  I am however reluctant to give up on an otherwise great relationship.  I want to be able to frame my concerns in a way that will be most acceptable to her and be as convincing as possible.
"&gt; thinks it's reasonable for the parents to have doubts given the circumstances

It's not."
"Remember that you can't have too much support, or too many people who love you. One day you may have neither."
Both times this came up was pretty much on the heels of what happened.  Maybe I should try and discuss this later on tonight since we're not playing any games or anything.
Don't be obtuse; you know what they're trying to say.  Take a look at how he treats his subordinates.  Take a look at how he treats those whose job it is to serve.  The above poster isn't saying that people in the service industry are literally beneath him.
"I mean, I don't see any females producing y chromosomes in any of their gametes..."
"Yeah.. guess I should've seen myself how strange it is. And I was underage for my first relationship, I was 15 but I was just totally taken with her and did't stop to think how weird it was. I guess she's right, anger aside. "
I think you should explain about your past experiences and ask him what he prefers you do next time. If you don't feel like his suggestion is going to improve your safety go from there. In my experience keeping a husky on a chain for regular periods of time sounds like a recipe for disaster. 
"If you go to her house to pick her up and she isn't ready, you leave without her.

If you set a time to meet at a restaurant and she's late, order and eat without her. 

If you agree she will be there at 2 and she hasn't left by one, tell her not to come. 

She'll kick up a fit, but errbody' schedule can't revolve around her anymore."
"No she should stop having him over. This is her problem and she is turning it into yours. Be firm and tell her that if you are not allowed to dress the way you want to and are not allowed to talk to the people you want to (in this case her boyfriend) SHE needs to work on a solution. If that means that boyfriend isn't allowed to come over, that's tough luck for them and that's something they need to fight out. Just because her boyfriend has a thing for you doesn't mean YOU should go out of your way to oblige to her crazy rules. Your room/house, you can do whatever the flying fuck you want.  

Edited to add: the one thing you could do is be mindful of what you are wearing around this guy like u/advisor58 said, but seriously don't go out of your way to oblige to her. Again, her problem, not yours."
"Can anybody honestly say, there isn't an instant or moment or person, somewhere at some point, that they would've not been perfectly content killing if they could get away with it?

I promise I can find a scenario for any person in the world where they'd be like, ""well, yeah, if it's legal, I would fucking kill them in that situation"".

Now morally killing is going to be always wrong, but what if what the other person did is so immoral that you consider the immorality of your act as a proper punishment for the morality of their act?

I'm not advocating murder or saying I'd be cool with it or want to or anything like that. What I'm saying in a hypothetical world that's just talk and bullshit, I don't think it's so crazy for someone to admit that, yeah murder could be a possibility under the correct circumstances. 

I think it's a little stranger that you're so adamently against having a weird, quirky, hypothetical conversation. If I couldn't sit around and bullshit and talk about how I'd react in a bunch of situations that I'm never going to be involved in, I have no idea what I'd talk about with my friends. "
"You need therapy, stat."
"I'm with everyone else. I usually am the ""work it out"" type but he just crossed a major line and it's only going to escalate. Drop this guy like a hot potato."
"Your sister got out of the hot seat with your mom by joining forces to attack you. Unfortunately, you don't get a say in whether or not you are the black sheep and cannot force them to treat you differently.

Perhaps you are better off separating from them and working to improve yourself and your own life. Therapy is worthwhile, especially therapy that looks at relationships and family systems, as these are skills that you need for your whole life and it helps if they're functional.


Your family dynamic has been chosen by your parents and they have all of you pitted against each other, performing in competition for their love and attention.  This keeps any of you siblings from being truly close, and means that it is a cutthroat environment.


"
"I can't imagine losing a child at 18 weeks. We found out the gender at 11 weeks, so baby had a name by then. We had clothes through 2 years by that point, a crib, a painted nursery, etc. If my mom was saying ""get over it,"" I'd have no patience for that."
"Get estimates on removal of tree and ask if they are willing to pay.  Depending on size of tree, could be $300 - $1200.  If they whip out the checkbook, say ""just joking, I'm keeping the tree.""  Check the homeowner regulations -- you might want to consider, if allowed, planting a row of those tall Cyprus trees a lot of people use to give themselves more privacy in their yards.  imho, those people are weird. edited to add: fuck their ""view."""
"You are not a smart man. 

""I met someone who's younger than you, more attractive, definitely smarter. Yup she's real girlfriend material. And what you been up to?"" 

The only way this could have blown up in your face worse is if you were trying for that outcome. You are FWB and you do use her for sex, BUT a ""normal"" persons reaction to this question is  (I really don't need any FWB knowing every detail about my personal life..) ""Oh I went with a friend, it was really nice."" You obviously do not give a 2nd thought about anyone's feelings but your own. That's honestly completely fine and your prerogative, but at the same time I don't think you get to feign ignorance when other people end up getting their feelings hurt...  "
"Lol, this could be a sitcom. Adam Sandler marries into a family where he is the only male and the family goes nuts. It also kind of reminds me of Horton Hears a Who, where the mayor has 100+ daughters and only one son."
"How strange, I could never have imagined where she got all of this entitled behavior.  /s"
"If this is a troll, this is fantastic.

If it's not a troll, your boyfriend is displaying increasing signs of mental illness and needs that checked immediately."
"So... you're going to give your kid a bad middle name because ""Everyone dislikes their middle name,"" ?"
The fact that she stopped taking her regular birth control should have been your first clue.
"You trust your wife right?

How about the next nanny is a super hot, muscular man. And while your wife's friends are over, they talk about how hot the new nanny is and your wife says ""yeah he's super hot"" and they spend their time, in front of you, oggling the new nanny.

Are you okay with that? Would that make you feel secure? If you were uncomfortable with that, would you be okay with your wife minimizing your feelings?

Because that is exactly what is happening right now. "
"It's not about you; it's about their own insecurities. They're worried about whether or not other people will perceive them as attractive/desirable. They're worried about being dark because they've internalized a lot of media and social messages about how it's ""bad."" If their families are anything like mine (I'm East Asian), they're probably worried that their families will scold them about it--if I tan even a little my mother tells me I look like a farmhand. 

Personally, when someone else says something stupid that makes it awkward--I lean into it! I look at them so they *know* I heard that shit, and then I just keep looking at them, maybe smiling slightly, until they feel compelled to either apologize or change the topic as quickly as possible. 

Don't be scared of awkward moments. Learning to lean into it, let that awkwardness hang in the atmosphere, and silently savor the way someone else has just made an ass of themselves is like public shaming without the effort. It has really reduced repeat offenses from my acquaintances. 

(Alternatively: pick a feature of the room you're in! That's where the hidden camera is. Every time someone says something stupid, just turn and look at the hidden camera like you're that guy on the Office.)"
"I dated a guy who helped undo the damage an unhealthy relationship caused me. He helped me recover my self-esteem and unlearn coping mechanisms and defensive strategies that had no place in a healthy partnership. It didn't work out between us in the end, but I will always be grateful for the part he played in my healing.

When I told the next guy I dated about my relationship history--he said that he was glad I met Ex #2 when I needed him the most. He was happy that I wasn't floundering alone or in an even worse relationship that would've broken me further, because he hated to think of me in pain even before we met. That really impressed me, because I felt the same way about him and the people in his life.

All this to say, if OP's ex had been an abusive asshole, then there would be reason for concern at his continued presence in her life. But since he's not, there's no call to erase that part of her history as if it had no part in shaping OP's life and growth as a person."
"""Brother seems happy, his adult girlfriend seems happy, how can I make this stop?????"""
"I didn't think about seeing my gp. It's early hours Saturday morning but if I call at like 7am they might be able to get me in for an emergency appointment. I don't know about taking Josh's sister to court but I know a gp will keep my secret. Dodgy fucking centrelink, I wouldn't be surprised if they never trained her about confidentiality."
"It kind of sounds like you're thinking of the wedding, joining him as husband and wife and the ceremony as a solemn, important, VOW and being blazed during this significant ceremony is disrespectful to you and the ceremony itself. It's like being blazed during a SACRED event. And he's just thinking of it as a party so of course he should do everything possible to have fun. 

You want him stone cold sober during a sacred event because it is sacred, and shows that he is going into this event fully aware of what he is agreeing to and the significance of it. He just views it as a party."
"Dear god I read the title 10 times thinking ""staples? STAPLES?"" As in those little metal things you stick papers together with. I was confused on so many levels. "
"What's to stop him from acting like this with someone new? It's not some strange voodoo curse she put on him, he's just an ass with no self control :/"
"I get your point but thinking that having mom constantly involved early on will be more rewarding for the kid than having a dad involved is inherently sexist. It would be logistically easier for the mom to take the SAHM role to start with but after she stops breast feeding, either parent could easily fill that role."
"&gt;My mom isn't the type of person to steal someone's spotlight, so I don't understand Jess' concerns.


You've been dating Jess for five years, so I assume she's known your mother for quite some time.  Perhaps the reason you don't understand her concerns is because she is seeing a different side of your mother than you are during their concurrent pregnancies.  

 
The MIL-DIL relationship is complicated even without the Duggar-level weirdness of the MIL becoming a grandmother *while pregnant*. That isn't how things generally happen - the mothers become grandmothers, and the daughters and daughter-in-laws become mothers.  Perhaps Jess feels like there is no place for her to become a mother in your family when the woman who is supposed to be shifting into the grandmother role is holding on for dear life.  It's just... weird.  


I would talk to Jess more about her feelings here, with an open mind.  For her to not invite your mother to the baby shower, this feeling of being ""upstaged"" must not be new."
Yup.  But something tells me OP's boyfriend isn't interested in solving problems but instead uses these little mistakes as an excuse to bully and berate people.  
"Hey, OP.

By now you've read other replies that have told you to leave this guy.  Maybe a part of you will still want to ""work through things"" or ""talk to him about it"" despite the general consensus.  So my post aims to talk to that part of you: when we're in a relationship our judgement sucks.  We want to see the best in the person we love and sometimes that means ignoring advice given to us.  At one point,  I was in a relationship with a guy that everyone thought was an asshole.  While I knew on a logical level that his actions were asshole-ish,  I made excuses for him,  justifications,  and tried to make things better. I regret every damn second I spent with that guy after he showed me who he really was. 

You deserve better and I know that part of you knows this. You might love him but he clearly doesn't because love requires respect.  We have to walk away from toxic people even though it may hurt in the moment. In return,  you'll gain the love (self) and respect he has failed to display.  He showed you who he was - ""I'm disrespectful,  I'm unloving,  I'm hurtful, and untrustworthy"".  Working through this would mean dismissing the implicit truth and arguing back with,  ""nah, baby, don't say that.  You're not."" He knows himself better than anyone and his actions reflect the former. 

Walk away. We're objective and are looking from the outside in.  Love clouds your judgement so do not trust the part of you that wants you stay.  You're strong, great,  and deserve love and respect. "
Writing letters..  Something to take to my next relationship as a young adult
"Remember that she has a condition , that she's getting medication for it and that you love and support her. 

You get frustrated ? you may snap ? Imagine how she feels knowing that her brain is messing with her sometimes and tasks that are supposed to be simple are making her confuse ? How powerless she must feel ? Or get her anxiety levels up ? Or even how 'stupid' she sees herself ?  Think about all the possibilities and that sure will make you see why you have to be calm , loving and support her.

Edit: typo "
"Right, but first he might show (fake) remorse and an outpour of emotion once you dump him. Ignore this. It's an act and a way to manipulate you. 

THEN you'll see his true colors."
"Exactly, everyone comes out annoyed and confused. All it took was a a magical ""Sorry, food allergy"" and no one gets hurt. So childish."
"&gt;if mom finds out she is going to freak

You're 24? Maybe start acting like it.

I suppose you want some actual advice, but I'm not going to tell a grown ass man how to stop his sister from tattling to his mom.

Instead, here are five points you should consider:

1. You. Are. Not. Ready. To. Get. Married. Don't do it. You will get divorced. Also, unless your fiancee is a particularly heinous person, she deserves better than you.

2. Who is this other woman? Is this someone you knew before, or some random fling you picked up somewhere? I ask because when (notice I said when, not if) your fiancee finds out, her decision on whether to stay with you may (slight chance, but may) be different if it was a one time mistake than if it was an ex or someone you've been talking to for a while.

3. Why did you cheat? Are you unhappy in this relationship? I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here, because your post makes it sound like you just don't give a shit about anyone but yourself. If you're unhappy with the relationship in some way, maybe try to learn from that and apply those lessons to your next relationship.

4. Get tested. If you've done this before, tell your fiancee to get tested.

5. Grow the fuck up."
Personally I would be furious with him. 
"Asking you to take off scrubs and take a shower when you get home from a job full of biohazards and possibly sick animals is a reasonable request to me.

Expecting you to never cuddle / kiss / get a lick on the cheek from your own dog is crazy. Matt lied to you early on in an attempt to stay with you, or he liked dogs in theory but doesn't like them in real life, or he's jealous of the time and attention your dog gets.  Whichever one it is, I'd say dump him."
"You know what? fuck your family and their judgmental bullshit.  cancel the wedding and you and your fiance elope and live your lives on your terms.  they should have zero say in anything you do and their treatment of you and your fiance has lost them any right to comment.  if you let them keep impacting your life like this, you're going to be miserable and eventually your fiance is going get get sick of their shit and you'll pay the price.  you must set boundaries."
"Plus, I honestly don't think him asking if OP is controlling is really out of dislike, it could just be concern. I mean, OP wanted the prenup so he could keep most of his money, but he's upset that his fiance would want her own finances now? From the ex's perspective, all he is seeing is a guy that wants the fiance dependent on him, but doesn't want to give her any fair share of assets in a divorce (based on the first draft), leaving her with no job and no finances in case they split. I'm not saying he is controlling, but it's not very hard to see it that way from the lawyer's perspective. "
"*and he was the poor kid in private school and was not entirely privileged so he too understands the struggle.*

I think his emotional reaction is because of this. When you grow up around money but not having as much, it can make a person self-conscious about being seen as cheap, poor... trying to get a bargain in this context may be perceived as humiliating behavior, or make him feel less-than.  I think this is why he is so concerned with what everyone else paid, and not paying less."
"&gt; If anything I would send a less than $75 gift to her if you feel like you need to send something now.

I'd send a card."
"32 is old to a 21-year-old girl, is the point."
"I agree. It sounds like he was holding on for them, and once they were both 18 he felt like he could find his peace. It's more likely that he stuck around because of them, and not the other way around. 

Sadly I've known several people who were severely depressed who committed suicide, and in all cases they made every effort to get their life in order - paying down debts, spending quality time with friends and family - before going through with it. 

It's true that sometimes people are so overwhelmed by life that they employ a ""permanent solution to a temporary problem,"" but when someone's life is good or improving and they choose to end it anyway, that's when you know it's because of severe mental illness.

OP and her little brother bear no responsibility for their older brother's decision, and I'm sure he would be devastated to know they are blaming themselves, as understandable as it is. They could have been perfectly well-behaved and it probably wouldn't have changed a thing."
YOU. ARE. SCREWED. SORRY
"&gt; while you were dating/engaged.

Or while you were deciding to become parents."
"I'm queer and recently cut my mom and mostly my dad out of my life too. They weren't awful about my orientation, they're just really bad about understanding me as a person separate from themselves and their happy little narrative about who we are as a family. My mom has always been unstable and abusive; my dad is an enabler and a workaholic. So I get where you're coming from, especially on being in serious pain and getting zero support (and, in fact, threats -- because your mom slamming that stool on the ground was a threat). 

Maybe your parents will change, but it'll take a long time for that to happen. Like, years. Multiple years. There is nothing you can say or do that will teach them how to be okay parents or convince them to try. It was wise of you to just cut them out instead of sticking around for years to persuade them into health, like I did. 

They don't really know you. They had an image of a perfect daughter in their heads, but that daughter was not a real person and couldn't have been real: she was a paper doll they could dress up, she was their golden child when they wanted to project their dreams onto her and brag about her, and she was their scapegoat when they needed one, I'm guessing. Any parents who reject their children over something as fundamentally immutable and yet totally unrelated to character as sexual orientation *do not really understand their children as individuals at all.* And they're not capable of that kind of understanding. So they didn't reject you. They don't even really know you. They rejected reality and all the love you had to offer them, because they prefer their own illusions. It hurts. It hurts so much.

I'm so glad you're okay and you took care of yourself. You deserve health and happiness. It's okay to be angry and sorrowful. It's okay to doubt your choices and who you are. It's okay to be really fucking confused. Whatever you feel is okay, and I'm sending you my love."
Yeeeaaahh this is my thought too. Smells like bullshit to me.
"Don't do that. Damn. Thats a no-brainer. Your brother should not live with you ever again.

Are you even sure that the woman is his psychiatrist? A real psychiatrist? This situation just sounds so crazy. Like other people said it seems like  a huge breach of private information and incredibly blatant manipulation coming from a person who should not indulge that crap from other people let alone do it themselves. This seems like the sort of crap that would cost people their medical licenses.

My opinion: Hes your brother sure, but hes a big kid now and needs to deal with his shit on his own, NOT AT YOUR EXPENSE (financial, mental, and physical). At this point in time you have given him so much and he has caused you pain for it. You owe him nothing at all. "
"My friend's nickname that her dad uses is Arnie, I've literally never heard him call her by her given name, which is Caroline, and I've known her since kindergarten. I used to think Arnie was some derivative of Caroline, but, nope. He nicknamed her after the special needs brother in What's Eating Gilbert Grape."
"Newborns are rough. 

When my son was born, he looked nothing like I imagined. He looked like a wrinkly, mottled, coneheaded frog. By 2 months he progressed to looking like Mussolini. By 4 months, he was the handsomest boy in the world, and has firmly remained as such henceforth. 

You've been around this block, but your husband has never experienced a newborn before. He has been surprised by that sick feeling of disappointment, that ew, his baby is an awful little homunculus! But, as a good Daddy, as all parents everywhere, he dare not admit this dread, even to himself. Hence he focuses these icky feelings onto the name.  

This is not about the name at all. That's why he can't come up with an alternative. 

Keep raising your soon-to-be beautiful Aurora ""Rory"" Marie and help your husband deal with his new daddy nerves. He may well get this sorted out in another couple of months. If not, he might want to go to a counselor to talk over his ambiguous feelings about being a first time father of a baby in a safe space.  

Edit: a word. "
Your neighbours sound like a controlling and manipulative bullies. If you decide to cut down the tree it won't be the last issue you have with them.
"It's a cliche, but part of what you need is time. I started dating a man soon after I moved to a new city, and for a while after we broke up, everything and everywhere reminded me of him, because all of my memories of life in the city had him in there. So part of what you need to do is make new memories. Here's my list of things that might help: 

1. Rearrange your furniture. That way you're not always seeing him out of the corner of your eye and reliving memories. It'll force you to reprocess your space, instead of automatically including him in it
2. Go places you never went with him. Try new restaurants. Go to a store he didn't like. Wander around Ikea. Go to the library or the new cat cafe or wherever. Look for events happening in your town on the weekends and go. 
3. If you're into solo activities that would normally keep you inside the apartment like reading or browsing the internet, take them outside. Go read at the park or the beach or the lake. Being outside is good for your mental health. 
4. Watch movies and TV shows he didn't care for, or find new ones to try if you hear his voice complaining in the back of your head. 
5. Look up one of those lists centered around a thing you like. ""30 books to read before you're 30"" or whatever. Do the list. 
6. Get some colored paper, make a bunch of little strips, and learn how to make paper stars. Every day, write at least one positive thing on the strip, and make a paper star and put it in a jar. Some days these things might be as small as ""made it through my shower without crying"". The point is to acknowledge that there's still positive things in your life even without your relationship. 
7. Take up crafting or some activity that will make your apartment a total mess. Spread out everywhere and don't worry about cleaning it up for a few days or weeks. 

I hope these help you, OP, and I wish you the best. "
"My boyfriends aunt and uncle recently lost a lot of weight. They're in their early 60's. 

The husband was taken off his insulin prescription. The wife has no cartilage in her knee. She said every pound of weight contributed 15 pounds of pressure per square inch on her bone on bone joint. 

Together they owned and operated a very successful marine trade business. Their sons are taking it over. A very middle class American Dream type family. 

But they let their health go while building their secure life. They have loving children, life long friends, good relationship with extended family, known in the local church and small business community. And they lost the weight to enjoy all of it more thoroughly. "
"What if you and your sisters offer to pay or help pay? 

Has anyone talked to Jack about going to therapy? If they are against it, maybe having all of their children confront them with the many red flags that he is exhibiting will help sway their opinion. 

It's insane that think that anyone, let alone a 14 year old, will just ""get over"" seeing that. "
"I would sell the sillier stuff (planes and racehorse shares) as soon as possible. Having that stuff will be like spitting in her face for everything she's done to help save money for the family over the years. The good news is that you didn't start a second family in Florida, where the two horses and three planes aren't two boys and three girls you had with another woman. You need to be ready to rebuild the trust and for her to be skeptical that you don't have that second family. I would also be prepared for possible divorce, and for your life to change. If you and your wife are still in love with each other and want to be together, you've got a good chance to make things work. And while 1.5m is a good chunk, you're not going to be retiring soon and living a life of luxury (it can evaporate quickly). I would imagine your wife will be relieved that the kids will be able to go to college debt free and that she doesn't have to worry about the car breaking down, that's reason enough to tell her."
"As a DFF that is also introverted, DO NOT avoid going out with your friend if you care about your friendship. You are the one in control of your self-esteem, so grab it by the horns and take control! Instead of avoiding a night out with your friend, find a tactic that will help boost your motivation for the night:

-Tell her about a different location you're excited to try out. Does that one place have to be written in stone? A great friend will be willing to hear you out on your preferences.

-Invite another friend or two (bonus points if one is in a committed relationship)... You won't likely be alone often/long if you have a group instead of a pair.

-Buy a new dress, get a haircut, or do your nails... Be ready to feel sexy, whatever that could mean for you. Feel great and your confidence will radiate!

-Remember that the only way you can feel humiliation is to allow it to affect you. It's not intrinsically doomed for embarrassment by not being asked to dance. It just means there wasn't a great fit for you there that night. Don't let the number of dance partners discourage you and poison your self-esteem.

-Most importantly, stop comparing yourself to your friend. By feeling embarrassed that she's prettier, more slender, and dances more with partners, you're setting yourself up for failure. There's a reason your friend likes you and wants your company, remember that! She sees the best in you, even if you can't, so bring it. :)"
"Ok so.. You don't mention how long you and your wife have been together, but from what you posted she has been fine with your friendship for those years, then it suddenly isn't.

&gt; This feels like it's coming out of nowhere

Something like this doesn't come out of nowhere, either your wife is very ill with sudden personality change, has failed to communicate any uncomfortable feelings on this, or you have failed to pick up on the warning signs. 


It's a very tricky situation. Know that it doesn't matter if Callie was your actual sister, mother, a man (assuming your are heterosexual) you have a very close friendship, which requires some sort of awareness from you in regards to making absolutely sure your partner is fine and especially making sure they take priority and know it. It is a minefield in a relationship. 

Without knowing what your wife is thinking it's impossible to know, but I'll throw out some maybes;

- Texting Callie during you and your wifes date nights. 
- Cancelling date nights because of Callie.
- Forgetting or cancelling special occasion because of Callie.
- Not inviting your wife to spend time with you and Callie. 
- Spending more time with Callie than with your wife.
- Sharing more feeling, news or emotions with Callie, or sharing them with Callie first.
- General prioritizing of Callie.

Any of the above may have caused resentment. More than likely repeated incidents needed to build resentment to ultimatum point.

- Any history of dating, or none platonic activity with Callie your wife may have recently found out about that she didn't know before (including before you dated).
- Any texts or communication with Callie which contains the word 'Love' or soppy things your wife may have recently come across.
- Physical intimacy (holding, prolonged hugs etc) with Callie your wife may have found out about. 
- Any reason for your wife to suspect your relationship is not platonic (any writings, photos about or of Callie in a none platonic state)

Any of the 4 above may have caused immediate ultimatum.

Many times we might dismiss any or all of those because *we* know how we feel about platonic friend, so it doesn't come across as odd or inappropriate to us. It's important to note though, your actions will dictate what your partner thinks and no amount of 'It's platonic' words will change that. If your actions point otherwise, your words are just lip service.

I imagine from your wife's POV the dynamic has changed. You used to be two couples who were good friends. Now it's you and Callie only. Way back before Callie met her husband you may have been used to a relationship that ceased to exist when you were both married, now you *may* be attempting to slide back into that which could cause issues. 

For advice? If you look at all the above and are ; No, nope, nadda for it all then your in a impossible situation. I'd suggest writing a letter to your wife wishing to work through this, noting you have gone through your history and are blind to what you might have done to upset her, as such you will not make a descision - but she is free to tell you and go from there. You can not let yourself be pushed into such a thing without any reasoning. 

If you are looking above and going 'Yes, but...' then it's the 'but' part which is the problem. Your wife as decided she doesn't want a husband who does these things. 

Good luck!

"He wants to merge finances. We have a pretty strict budget right now, and it gets split 50/50 from our own money. When we get married he says that we will have a joint account that goes towards what we split now. Little, personal expenses (like haircuts, trips out with friends, etc) would be paid for from our own separate accounts. 

I just don't really see that happening given how strict he is now. If he wants to do something and I can't afford it, we don't do it. Which I get. I think that's reasonable. But I also think we've been together for four years...I'm not his pal bumming money for a cigarette. I'm his live-in girlfriend, and most of what I buy he benefits from, too, anyway. "
"I think she comes off looking worse in this one. Face it head on, don't be confrontational but don't stress too much about it either. "
"I can understand if he doesn't cut his son out of his life, but think about it. Family is supposed to look out for you, not fuck your SO behind your back. The son sleeping with OP's girlfriend says, to me anyway, that the son thinks more of his happiness and desires than his dad's, so much so he would encourage his dad's GF to cheat WITH HIM. His son is no longer family, IMO."
"&gt; I would imagine though, that your father deeply regretted hurting your sister and your family

You're imagining this based on what? 

His behavior? The things he said and did? 

Why the constant need to say oh people are good even when they do atrocious things - there's some good in there and it's up to the injured person to somehow find that grain of good and forgive the mountain of evil? "
"You could argue that 23 year old have ""more options"", however, they also have less life/relationship experience and are more likely to put up with garbage like this.  A more experienced woman, even if she has less options, would likely have told him to STFU already and wouldn't be afraid of rocking the boat.

After enough dating, you learn to start demanding respect.  OP isn't there yet because this joker picked her up at 21 and is probably her first serious relationship."
"I honestly think you have to be leaving something(or multiple somethings) out of the story. I have to wonder if DD was not as innocent as you make her out to be in this. Sure MM's behavior could just caused by the fact that she's a teenager who sounds fairly spoiled and I think if it had been handled properly her problems would have gone away fairly quickly. Either you guys dropped the ball somewhere or the problems are much more complex than that. Also MM being a brat doesn't explain your wife's change of tune. Is it possible that your wife and daughter are just horrible people? Yes, but I think it's equally possible that DD was just as much the problem as MM was and after she was out of the house MM was able to open your wife's eyes to that fact. And if that's the case given the way you seem to view the way the whole thing went down(MM is 100% to blame, DD was 100% the victim) I don't blame her for going to her mother instead of you. "
"That analogy doesn't really work. That would be treating the daughters unevenly due to poor planning and/or outside circumstances. In the OP'S case, the money exists, but the parents are choosing to share it hugely unevenly. "
"She cheated on you and then kicked you out of the house? No wonder you are angry. Who wouldn't be? Look, long-term you'll need to eventually let go of your anger as part of moving on with your life. Maybe forgiving her will be a part of that, though not necessarily. You want to eventually be a happy person, not a bitter ex-husband, but this is all so new and raw. You need time completely apart from her to separate your identity and heal from this betrayal. 

If you have a lawyer, maybe you can have all communication go through him or her. If that's not feasible, then limit communication to practical details related to the divorce and separating your stuff. Don't even bother responding to messages on any other topic, like her asking your to forgive her. Part of what you need to heal and move on with your life is to disengage with her emotionally and getting into conversations or text or email exchanges about forgiveness will just set you back. 

Presumably she is feeling some sort of shame or guilt and is asking forgiveness because she wants those feelings to go away, but it isn't your job to make her feel better and it wouldn't be good for either of you. She needs to honestly reckon with her own actions and easy forgiveness might interfere and you need to separate and heal. "
"Yup, that seals the deal for me. She was 20 or 21 when your father died. She was more than capable of contacting you then, or before then while your father was still alive. So why didn't she? Had a falling out with the adoptive family recently perhaps? Maybe about money? Maybe she wasn't interested in meeting her bio dad's side after all, since she's not interested in her mom's side..."

"Not everyone feels like fucking his own sister. That's what she is to him, and it's a pretty common and well explained phenomenon."
I mean fake eyelashes is a hell of a lot smaller than lying about two whole degrees and your whereabouts during that time as well as your grades for another one.
Pervs on reddit have a reason to make you believe they were just peeing in public.
"More practically speaking: newborns are either very quiet or very loud.  By the time your wedding arrives, your sister will either have a colicky baby who cries non-stop, or a warm bundle who will sleep when swaddled for hours at a time.  Either way a newborn literally CANNOT be away from a nursing mother for any length of time over, say, an hour.  Newborns are not like older babies who are louder and more demanding of attention and easier to swap out caretakers for.  I've been to more than one elegant reception where one of the guests had a newborn wrapped up in a sling and I didn't notice until the end of the evening.  Your sister shouldn't want that baby passed around the reception getting everybody's germs anyhow.   

I'm super serial about this:  your sister is not being unreasonable, she really does need to stay with her newborn baby.  Also, it's very likely that a newborn baby will not create any disruption at your wedding ceremony or reception.  Is there a chance that the baby will start to cry during the ceremony and will need to be removed.  Sure. (There's also a chance that one of your guests will have a medical emergency or suddenly vomit) It's up to you to decide whether your Disney wedding is more important than your sister's presence, and whether you are willing to damage your family relationships over this issue."
"I'm in HR, and I can't imagine why you think HR would side with you? Something doesn't have to be in the employee manual to be unprofessional and inappropriate. "
"~~It's very possible, both of them are doing something incredibly stupid (backstabbing lover/father tremendously), so I wouldn't put it past them to do something equally stupid like get married after 3 months.~~ 

Edit: OP confirmed they did it behind his back, but I still wouldn't put it past them for it to have been a  very short process of 'dating'"
"Thanks! I have actually contacted a friend to come join me and my brother said it was perfectly okay (he checked with Diane first too). They are both very understanding about the whole thing. I just hadn't thought to ask someone else to come until you mentioned it. 

I am very happy for him and that is why I want to be there. I don't wear make up (skin condition, I cannot wear it if I wanted) so that won't be a problem. I will not be wearing anything dark colored so there is no concern there either. I know this day is about them and I want to celebrate that without ruining it for them. "
"Thank you, you're absolutely right.

I think when I posted this topic I felt fairly sure it was beyond saving but from all the replies I had so far (thank you!) I think there's definitely a lot of things that could potentially save the relationship before giving up on it.

I do want to make clear though that I am definitely not actively looking to get out clean to pursue my work friend, it was more that I saw her experience resulted in what seemed to me to be the sort of outcome I was looking for (ie, separation but remaining friends)"
"The problem here isnt your mooch houseguest its your own complete lack of spine.

WHY ARE YOU BUYING HER GROCERIES? WHY ARE YOU DRIVING HER PLACES?   WHY HAVENT YOU KICKED HER OUT?

Your friendship is completely over.  You shouldnt WANT to preserve it and the fact that you do shows you have major people-pleaser issues you need to address.

Bag up her shit and put it on the curb.  Its not legal, technically, but what's she going to do? Sue you?  If you want to do it by the book give her a 2 week eviction notice."
"
&gt;She's to far enough along for it to be my child. We broke up at the last of March and briefly got back together/had a fling for a few days 3 weeks later. At no point did I have sex with her during the 3 weeks before that, but she is farther along than that. If it was mine she would be like 10-11 weeks pregnant, but she is 13 weeks pregnant so that isn't possible. I figure she was hooking up with other guys during those 3 weeks and is trying to pass the kid off as mine because she wants to get back together.

You are aware that the first two weeks of pregnancy are pre-conception, right?  Pregnancy is dated from last menstrual period, not conception.  If she is 13 weeks pregnant and you had sex 11 weeks ago, it is possible the baby is yours."
"A lot of this doesn't make any sense to me. You're speaking on someone else's intelligence, but your paragraph is all over the place. "

"Hey. Hey hey hey. Out of personal curiosity, when you and your wife were separated, did you ever have anything to do with your affair partner? Or anyone else? I kinda really need to know this because someone else brought it up and now it's just fuckin *killing* me."
"Sounds like your GF has a stalker ex who (unfortunately for her) has access to nudes of her. Most likely this stalker ex did this with the hopes that you'd break up with her because he is a stalker ex.

Regardless if you talk to her or not, I wouldn't reply to the message. What's the point? The message wasn't ""Hey, your GF is cheating on you, here's proof."" The message was ""Tell X I said hello."" It was literally sent as a threat, so there is no reason to respond to it, ever.

As for approaching her, chances are this stalker has been doing this to her repeatedly so she'll know about it. However, on the off chance she doesn't you really should tell her gently about a message you received and then show it to her so you don't have to describe it."
"&gt; I know he cares about me, he just doesn't care about things he can't change. 

I am pretty carefree about most things in life. I don't take things too seriously, pretty chill...but fuck off if my SO is being violated. This wasn't even fringe behaviour, it was blatant assault. And not only would I be upset about my friend, I would be upset because it hurt you. I would want to figure out a way to fix the problem. I don't care how chill he is, his pulse needs work if he can't comprehend the severity of sexual assault.
"
You two need to break up. 
"I was 18 when I lost my fiancé, who was my total world, in a car accident. I became so numb from the pain and grief I ended up making a lot of really bad decisions in my life. It's been 24 years now. If I could go back in time to right after he died, here are some things I would tell that grieving young woman...
--1-- My first and best advice is see a therapist or grief counselor. I skipped this important step and tried to go it alone. In hindsight, if I'd given it the proper time and effort, maybe I wouldn't have made so many mistakes in life and healed faster.
--2-- Abusing prescription drugs (or any other mind-altering substance) may seem to temporarily ease the pain, but it will not fix anything and will only cause you to make more bad choices. I'm not saying you would ever do this; I'm just speaking from experience.
--3-- Being with the first guy who wants you just because you are attempting to get the things you feel you are missing out on life, like marriage and children, will not fix anything. It only drags more people into your downward spiral. (That marriage was the worst 5 years of my life, in which I let an abusive jerk control me because my depression lowered my self esteem. Thanks to good friends, I eventually escaped that life.) 
--4-- You will never forget your fiancé who passed away (I still think of mine almost daily), but it does get much easier over time. Time truly can heal all wounds, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. There will always be a special place in my heart for him, but missing him no longer tears me apart inside, and I can review all my good memories of him without feeling the pain alongside it.  
--5-- Love may find you again someday (it even did for me as a divorced mom). If it does, don't make my mistake and lose that person by pushing them far away. At least give them a chance! When I started having feelings for my best guy friend, I refused to acknowledge them because he reminded me too much of my love I'd lost. I felt like I was betraying my first love if I gave my heart away to someone else. It took me years to realize I'd probably thrown away my best chance at a happy normal life, so now I carry that regret on top of my other burdens.
--6-- This will be a tough time for you, even if you avoid the mistakes I've made. At first there will be days when you can't stop crying, and times when your heart aches so badly you fear it will literally break. But, take heart knowing there will be other days when you feel just a bit better, and you may even smile a little. I promise, you WILL get through this! I pray it happens sooner for you than it did for me, if only you don't let your grief control your life. (Sorry if I'm bumming anyone out with my sad story, but if I can prevent you, or even one person who reads this, from going through the extra troubles I've had by sharing my experience, it was well worth the pain of reliving it in my mind while writing it out.)
--7-- At some point, you will finally realize you are going to be okay, and then you will begin to truly live again, with an open heart and an optimism for a better and happier future. I know it's hard to see that right now, but take it from someone who's been where you are now. It has taken a long time to heal, but I now have a caring family, dear friends, and a fulfilling career. And though I may not have the perfect partner to share my life with, it's okay, because love comes in so many other forms too. The best part is I have laughter and joy again, and life feels so worth living!"
"So when you come to the same conclusion as the people you assume are women, it's because you're a clever man and can think about things but the supposed women just come to those same conclusions by siding with another woman and not because they can read and think just like you?"
There is nothing empowering about getting assaulted in a grocery store by a mentally unstable person. You seem to think everyone plays by certain rules and I find that attitude to be horribly naive. 
"Remember this feeling the next time you are feeling pressured to buy something. Car, lease, house, whatever. Always take the time you need to think things through."
"Yeah, but he does consider it cheating, so it is. 

May be news to be, but I've always been under the impression you don't make out with other people when in a relationship?"
"This was me.  

Scared to death but instead of getting hit this time, he decided we needed a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun on our vacation.  After I picked him up with the sheriff on the other side of the island since he was too drunk to drive, I was told I embarrassed him in front of his ""new friends"" (WTF), he pulled out the gun, fired it outside of the window while I was driving and then placed the ""HOT GUN BARREL"" on my temple while I was trying to drive back to our hotel and then he threatened to kill me.

He was and is the love of my life...  I left him 26 years ago.

Edit: Spelling"
I know i shouldn't laugh but this problem made me laugh. Where has she gone and more importantly how is she going to feed herself?
"LOL so OP is saying, ""I've lied to my wife for years and make 60% more than she thinks I do. How can I come clean without having to actually part with any of my money?""

Enjoy divorce court, dude."
"If my sibling lost their spouse to suicide only a year ago, I think seeing them for lunch each day _would_ be reasonable. Its possible depending on their type of personality, whether theyre also getting help from grief counselors and other friends/family, and their culture (whether there's the expectation that family vs individuals come first) around that that this could be an unhealthy dependance. But its possible that this is simply what she needs to heal and that she's not asking too much.


Anyways, if this was about his wife slowly beginning to resent losing daily attention over the past year, I would expect her to have said something earlier or to have become significantly more irritable at 3 or 6 months. Instead she's encouraged him to spend more time with Callie, until now where she's changed her stance 180 overnight. So I'm guessing someone has fed her rumors about her husband being inappropriate or cheating on her, and that's scared the shit out of her. If she was willing to talk, I would encourage OP to encourage her to talk to someone she trusts to give good advice that she hasn't spoken to yet about this (like parents or other friends) because they might bring her out of this desperate emotional reaction."
"Extortion requires him to be asking for something in order to keep from speaking to the police.

"He sounds like the type of guy who thinks you can win a woman's romantic/sexual interest with enough acts of kindness. Now that he knows it's not going to work, he's retaliating.

Document everything: all the weird occurrences and passive-aggressive remarks, as well as your suspicion that he's interested in you and your reminder that you're only work friends. Don't be afraid to take it to HR if it escalates, and definitely don't be afraid to discuss the hygiene issue."
"It's actually an under reaction. You should be considering divorce over this. Your husband is a shit human being, I don't know why you'd stay with someone who is such a terrible person. "
"I think this is a very insightful and wise analysis, a distinct possibility in my opinion. "
"I don't think you're being unreasonable. You've made a considerable concession for the Bachelor Party, probably something far above what most would do. 

If she's unwilling to sit at a table by herself for an hour or so, I'd tell her to stay home. I get it can be awkward not knowing a lot of folks, but she's 23 and not 13 for Christ's sake."
Not when they are entitled and have their hard working little brother under their thumb with the threat of unfamily-ing him.
"Yup! I pointed that out too. It's disgusting to me that her brother calls the women on GW whores and low-lives but he *found the post because he was jerking off to those women.* What an angry, confused individual. I would want nothing to do with a person like that in my life, family or not."
"This is the weirdest post I've seen in a while, so congrats on that."
"Yup. While I personally see private stripping as different from public stripping, that was not clear in their relationship ... so even if he says ""you should have left immediately"", he has no right to hold it against her since this isn't something they discussed and it's not necessarily intuitive."
"Except he didn't compliment her, he implied that now he has reason to worry about other people finding her attractive when he didn't before."
"One of my good friends is an anesthesiologist and he's told me that if alternative medicine is helping you manage your pain without drugs, he's all for it. To quote something I've seen in Reddit several times, if it's stupid and it works, it isn't stupid. "
"Wills can be contested. But if your lawyer said you're good you probably are. She likely wormed her way into your grandparent's wills. It's sad but the elderly are easily taken advantage of. Stick to your guns. Help where you can but none of your inheritance is ""rightfully hers"". "
"Here is the reality of the situation: 

Your sister is 38. She is lucky she got pregnant as quickly as she did. My close friend is trying to have a baby at 37 and she hasn't had much luck. With how fickle pregnancy can be, hopefully, your sister is okay and nothing goes wrong. *But* you aren't going to win this Baby War. 

I don't want kids at all. My sister is currently pregnant and has one kid. I am not very interested in it, but if I had something planned around the time she was having her kid... I'd move it. Wouldn't even risk missing out on my ""deserved"" attention for a kid. I would lose so badly. Babies tend to make people go goo-y eyed. 

So my suggestion is to pick a date 6 months out from the due date. This will allow the family to get over the shiny baby feels, the kid can stay home, and you will look like a nice, giving auntie. When in reality you will also be getting your Princess Day with all the attention you want. 

Nothing wrong with wanting your perfect wedding. But you are not going to come out shiny and lovely with people thinking you're the Evil Witch. So if you want to be the fairest in the land, you need to be fair to your family. You are asking them to go against their own happiness.

I don't think a party is worth torching your whole life. Your sister wants to be there, you want her there. Stop this pointless fighting and stop holding them hostage. You have a right to not want children at the wedding, but if your sister is important to you, then you will make some changes to make her happy.

Also, if your sister goes into labor within a week of your wedding, there is no way she is going to be up for anything. And your Mom will be worried about her. If she goes into labor a day or two before your wedding, your mom might choose to go to the hospital instead. 

Not much of a princess wedding. More like a party no one really pays attention to because baby."
"It's more than a little disturbing that your own family is willing to pimp you out to a stranger. I get money's tight, but damn."
"Oh, I suspect that *everyone* will know why she's not invited. "
"Jon should have cut Brian out of his life years ago as you know.

Someone else on this sub once wrote that the nicest people are the easiest to manipulate because they believe that everyone else is as nice as they are. They think that people must be misunderstood or not understand the consequences of their actions themselves. 

It sounds to me like Jon falls into this type and that he has become so accustomed to Brian that he doesn't realise how destructive and toxic the friendship is. 

One way you might convince Jon to see the error of his ways is to point out to him that Jon is not actually being a good friend to Brian. All he ever does is protect Brian from the negative consequences of his actions by smoothing out the problems. Because of this Brian never learns that he needs to change. 

You could also point out to Jon that he is not being a good friend to his other friends by continuing to involve Brian in their lives. He should not be bringing a man who has sexually assaulted at least one women and harassed another into your friendship group.

Frankly, if you and Jon were my friends I would have dumped you both by now because no matter how lovely you both are, Brian is too high a price to pay. 

I would be careful that you draw very strict boundaries when you do move into your new home. I would be pushing for a severe restriction in contact with Brian. He wouldn't be welcome in my home. You need to have some decisions in place about what you will do when Brian turns up at your house uninvited because I'm sure that he will pull that at some point.  The move is your chance to draw a line in the sand here. "
"It's pretty messed up that your family picks on her because she ""only"" has a certificate. You say it's only teasing, but I'm sure she sees where it's really coming from. 

Always adopt a pet. "
"Agreed. This story actually reminds me of a story from here where a bride was furious at her sister or best friend OP (can't remember) because she wanted OP to play violin at her wedding under some wisteria. She'd ""seen it in a dream"". Problem, OP couldn't play violin (like, at all), and wisteria was out of season. So the bride was FURIOUS and tearful and ""I can't believe you won't do this for me"". OP ended up going to the groom and as it turned out I think the bride was experiencing a manic episode. This needs immediate medical attention, tbh. It could be any number of things, but it's indicative of a problem."
[deleted]
"Yeah, my sisters have spent quite a bit of time trying to influence my decisions after I graduated high school, and now most recently with this whole brother/nephew thing, I feel like I might just cut them out once I move again, as I won't be living as close to them anymore. 

My dad isn't so bad, he's just not use to being the sole parent. Growing up my dad was always so busy with work, he missed out on parenting, so I don't quite blame him for not really knowing what to do and for being disappointed. 

Next time they bring the topic up, I'm just going to tell them that no, I do not and will not be part of my brother's life and to stop pushing it. I'm also going to tell them to not give my brother my new phone number once I move, and that if they give him that number, they wont get my new number once I change it again. "
I hope she follows through with the abortion. If she wants a baby she needs to stop with the drugs and get her shit together before getting pregnant. If she thinks raising a baby in a house with someone who uses fucking heroin is a good idea she is no where near ready to be responsible for another human being.
"This is good. Also, as a rebut to 'what the fuck are you doing,' 'I'm (fucking) cooking. Now unless I'm doing something that will burn down the house or poison me, kindly get the fuck out of the kitchen.'

My SO is a bit like OP's. He would always nitpick when it came to cooking, and I'm not a great cook, still learning, but damn did his way of correcting me grind my gears. So I talked to him, and now I do the prep work and clean up and he does the cooking. But when I cook my own food (or one of 'my' dishes for both of us), we have a rule that he stays the fuck out of the kitchen unless I specifically request his help, and then he helps me with what I need and gets the fuck out again. it has worked thus far."
"That context doesn't make it any better. She's not 5, she's an adult. 

Your relationship with Allison is completely inappropriate in the context of *you have a girlfriend*. And if you want to still have one after these 2 weeks, you'll be stopping this immediately. 

Wait a minute....Ted Bundy, is that you? If you want to talk, just PM me, don't waste these guys time. "

"&gt;Laurie is currently upset that I'm even needing to think about this and has gone to the guest room. I've been instructed to leave her alone until I decide.

She's refusing to talk to him until he tells her what his choice is. That's why there's a problem that he's posting about. I'm not sure what advice to give to him honestly in this situation, because I agree, they absolutely need to talk it out and she needs to give him more than ""Choose"". Maybe he should just wait for her to be willing to talk, I don't know. Maybe she just needs to know that she's number one in his life, and he needs to communicate that to her in a clear and explicit manner. But she's going about it the wrong way right now. I'm frustrated and empathetic to both of them because clearly she's hurting deeply to come to the point of doing this, and he feels blindsided and at a total loss. "

"Ugh, whenever I don't wear makeup or as much makeup to work, all I hear all day is, ""are you sick?!"" No, this is just my face, thanks. "
"This is...odd. You gave her an out - she could have just said the tv was on and she didn't. I mean, if someone else was there she has done a terrible job of hiding it. 

Talk about it again when you're face to face, it will be harder for her to lie and easier for you to tell if she is lying. But the mind does play tricks, and she didn't take the really easy and straightforward option of saying the tv was on when she could've, so I think there's a legit possibility that no one was there.

"if you are already pissed about this, you should probably break up now.

 if you stay, the resentment will poison your relationship anyway."

Yes. "
"This is what I get from the post as well.  Hopefully the new GF isn't as closed minded as he is, and maybe providing TMI will help put her on your side, and she might tell her BF to STFU."
"For once, there's not enough information here. How do you know that you are not his sidechick? How long have you been together? Do you live together? Met his parents and friends? ...?

"Six weeks? You should be able to schedule a lab visit for a day or two from now and drop off a sample (or generate one in the clinic). They should have the results a few days after that at most. You shouldn't have to see the actual doctor at all.

"Let me rephrase:

Does it concern you that she is emotionally unstable enough to take a leave of absence from her job in order to insert herself into your life and try to ruin your *upcoming* marriage/10 year relationship?

Do you think this something that a mentally/emotionally healthy adult does?"
"Honestly, I think you should leave. I don't say that lightly, but this is a violent and dangerous man, and I'm worried that one day you'll get killed. I know that sounds crazy, but consider that this man just drunkenly choked you. I want to point out another thing:

&gt; If he doesn't apologize profusely that's when I'll really start to insider getting out.

Even if he does apologize profusely, that's not enough. Profuse apologies are part of the cycle of abuse (google the term 'cycle of abuse', and I suspect you'll find parallels to your own relationship). When people do abusive things then fall all over themselves crying and begging forgiveness, they're essentially trying to guilt you into letting them off the hook for any actual consequences for their actions. So, unless he takes full responsibility and gives you some *concrete, specific* steps he plans to take to prevent this from ever happening again (note: going into rehab and sticking to it is a concrete step. Agreeing to move out and work on himself until you can trust him again, and letting people know why he's moving out, is a concrete step. 'Trying to drink less' is not a concrete step), you can safely assume it's all just more manipulation.

"Oh well boo-hoo perhaps you shouldn't have fucked a co-worker for 3 months while you weren't even separated, you are a hypocrite! Stop  only blaming your wife and her friend because you started this whole mess with your cheating! If you cared so much about Uncle Adam and your wife fucking perhaps you should have watered your own garden instead of looking for pastures greener with your mistress. I don't see how you could have cared much about your kids either while you ran around behind your wifes back, selfish and shitty behaviour. I've seen a comment further down from you about how you didn't get what you needed from home which is one of the lamest excuses I've ever heard. You should divorce and move on both you and your wife are toxic. I have no sympathy for either of you to be totally honest, you both suck."
"I used to think it was a very good reason until I was like, 22. I started doubting him afterwards but he always says that ""once the twins (his youngest siblings) turn 18 (in a year) that we will get married, we just have to wait a little longer!"" I'm starting to think it was dumb to stay and have a kid with him. Does he deserve another chance though? Would therapy help us? I'm willing to try if he agrees to cut contact with his parents in a year.

&gt; Where are you friends?

We share some friends, and I have very close ones but they live an hour and a half away from here. I contacted one of them before making this post but haven't heard back yet. I'm scared that the friends we share might take his side since they know him since before I was in his life :( They never treated me badly, but what if they turn out to be like Dick?"

"Is it interfering with you having real friends, holding down a job, and otherwise being an adult? "
"Okay, so as a fellow chica I totally understand how women get told to play it nice when talking to other people. But you are an adult, with a new house, and you have the right to host/not host anyone you want. You should speak up about who is invited, not make offers hoping people will not take you up on them. 

I would be really honest with her: I don't want Justin in my house. I love you very much and would love to have you visit. But with what happened last time, my boyfriend and I are not open to hosting Justin in our home or life in the future. You are welcome, he is not."
"So here's a possibility... you were blackout drunk and someone had sex with you and took your underwear. That's rape, and it's creepy that they took a trophy (if that's what happened and you didn't pee/forget to put them back on or whatever). It was somebody you worked with. They then blamed Alex for it, likely because they were scared. Were other men around that night? Who else might have had sex with you? Did you feel like you had sex the night before when you woke up? 

This should have been reported to the police a long time ago. I realize you blamed yourself and you probably called it cheating to your fiance, but if you had sex with someone it wasn't legal (providing you are in the US anyway). :/ "

Fact is, she has a fiancé who tried to screw her over financially. She is now thinking and protecting herself and her future."
"That's a good point. HE wanted to feel like he had a clean slate, it wasn't in order to improve your relationship. The fact that he expected you to brush it off, OP, shows he minimized it in his head and might not have much remorse."

"Hey op.

I've got good news and bad news for you.

Having known some trust fund babies I think one of the things they are constantly told is to split things 50/50 with potential SOs so that they aren't taken advantage of by gold diggers. It lets them know someone who really wants them, not their money. So basically these four years have been your proving you want him and not his money. It sounds like he wants to marry you so congratulations you won.

The bad news is when you love someone you want to give them the best. Normally these people start to relax the strings as they fall more and more in love and trust with their sos. What you said about presents is really really upsetting. He will splurge on himself or his sisters, but he makes sure to never buy you a present you couldn't afford yourself. That's very telling. You know he's rich so it's not like he is trying to keep that on the down low while he feels you out. So is that what he thinks you deserve? Cheap presents for your cheap life? Or is this having to split everything so engrained in him that it carries into the one part of the relationship that is supposed to be selfless (gift giving)? 

Can you think of one time when he offered to take you somewhere you couldn't afford just because, or bought that whole food wine and didn't make you pay back half?

If not you seriously need to sit him down and talk about your life plan. Because even though he might think he's going to pool finances after marriage that switch is going to be very very hard to flip after all the years, especially if it's carrying over subconsciously into gifts, and I seriously worry about him guilting you every time you spend ""his money"". Will the children vacations come from the pooled fund or will you have to split it? If you can't afford to do something fun with your bit of money will he just take the kids and leave you home? Because that is what he is setting you up to believe right now. etc, etc. these are things every couple should discuss before marriage, but you even more so because your and your children's future will be greatly impacted by the answers. 

As an anecdote:  I am not rich but I graduated college before my husband, when I had money and he was still broke and poor I would take him out on dates and pay because I wanted to go on a date with him. I bought and paid for transportation to a music festival for us because I wanted to go together... There's more but you get the point. I wanted to share experiences with him, I wanted to share my life with him more than I wanted to make sure we paid for things equally.

**You need to sit your bf down and ask if he wants you to be his equal partner in life, or if he wants you to pay for things equally, because he can't have both**. At this point (to us outside observers) he's made it obvious he would rather not share parts of his life with you, than risk you getting something you can't afford. 

Also do not pay for his dog. That is his dog, if you break up it goes with him and you have nothing. Don't put money into something you 1) can't afford and 2) isn't even yours. You helping take care of his dog, and loving on it makes you a great person, not an owner.

Bonus (don't do this unless you are fine with nuking the relationship): As a present buy him a locker he can put his expensive groceries in. Tell him he obviously wants them but wants to make sure you don't get any so you got him a locker so he doesn't have to worry about you trying to take advantage of him. If that doesn't help him get how he's making you feel like a second class citizen I don't know what will."
"Both of you are right for you, you just disagree on core subjects like sexuality and masturbation.

"Please tell me this kid is already in therapy after all the upheaval and bullshit he's been through.

"And she specifically has asked OP to just not be a dick about it.  That's the most important point here.  If he can't be in a relationship with someone like her, that's fine.  But don't attempt to modify her behavior through ""logical"" shaming.  That is why she hid it in the first place."
"This is beyond protecting yourself.  You don't trust this woman because you don't trust anyone.  

I wouldn't want to be in a three year relationship with someone who didn't trust me."
"She hasn't been outside the in 10 months because of this baby. What is the baby doing right now?  Eating, shitting, crying, sleeping. She's not neglecting the child, she's just struggling. I'm not surprised she doesn't have a super strong bond with the little infant, it hasn't done anything but make her life crazy and kinda miserable at this point. I think we can all worry about her feelings towards the baby when her life is less chaotic and full of sickness. When she can actually enjoy her child instead of being in survival mode. "
"I'm not telling you to be nice or respectful (although you should, because that's taking the high road and you don't want to stoop to their level).  I'm telling you to calmly and firmly stand your ground.  If you stoop to their level and start fighting, you are just as bad as they are.  

And as to the period comment, that's not a respect thing only, that is sexists against all women.  Knock it off."
"""He promised to pay for the wedding and then backed out.""

Don't expect the attacks to be fair."
"She owes you an explanation.  I would be on her parents doorstep demanding one.  The way she treated you is an immature and thoughtless way to treat someone you love , not to mention self centered!! "
"It does, but it's totally not constructive. I felt bad suggesting it. It would, however, make a heck of an update. "
"I'd tell him you aren't feeling ready for it yet, because it would probably hurt him to propose thinking you'll say yes and then be rejected.  Especially if he tells other people about his plans. 

I know you don't want to set a date for proposal, but I'd think about what it would take for you to be more ready.  More stable in careers?  Successfully manage to raise a pet together?  Have a few more disagreements that you resolve in a mature, amicable fashion?  Having some idea of what being ready looks like to you would probably help both of you. "
"&gt; got over it in a few seconds and said I must have been imaging everything because he did not get that drunk.

THIS IS SO BAD. He gave you a half-assed apology and shed some half-assed tears to make you feel bad for him. Drunk Shenanigans should refer to jumping in a pool fully clothed, or getting way too confident before karaoke, not abusing your partner. Get TF out."
"My family has had to section my brother because he whacked out and threatened to kill my parents one night.

If he doesn't seek treatment, you need to find a place for you and your children to go.

The fact that he screamed at you while you were laid up with a broken ankle, he took his opportunity to have power over you and that is simply disgusting.

I don't think you're fixated, you're waiting for the other shoe to drop.. it could happen or it will happen again. Will you wait to find out?

Please keep yourself and your children safe. We are all thinking of you."
"Well, whoever manages or runs your facility does not do a good job because this behavior has been tolerated for years. You said that the supervisor is friends with her so that option is out. You can a) just completely ignore her and contiue working there until you have your CNA or b) work at a different facility. Chances are this facility has a high turnover in staff because of people like this woman and things are never going to change."
"I'm with the other party on this one. She didn't communicate, voice her concerns, she just dropped the ultimatum bomb out of nowhere and doesn't even want to rationally talk about it. Probably because she knows how shitty this is."
"She sounds like one of those MIL that cannot be trusted with a secret. anything you tell her will be on facebook faster than sound. the peanut/abortion example really makes the following likely in my mind. 

I understand your concern but she sounds like a helicopter grandmother and watch out for her taking over the child's life if you let her babysit regularly. Seen plenty of families where the grandmother is very strong willed and ruins her children's lives by violating boundaries and establishing herself as the primary adult in the babies life.   The kid doesnt care what his own parents say because the grandmother is always acting 'in charge'.  Its a form of dysfunctional thats sad to watch. 

This is not necessarily what your MIL will do but she doesnt seem to get the concept of boundaries and respecting personal space, so just throwing the above out there as a real possibility.   

Your husband is on your side but he is dealing with a somewhat lost cause.  There is no changing her with logic or words.    Tough actions and discipline may be your only HOPE at a decent relationship with her.    I would discuss what boundaries you want in detail with husband, and make a plan for how to get that with your MIL.   Talking will be a waste of time so how you act with her will be your method of achieving what you want.  

good luck. "
"Sorry, but I'd seriously reconsider marrying this guy. He's 2 faced, and is honestly, probably homophobic (hence the hate speech) My parents are religious homophobic nuts, and when they start using hateful slurs, or bashing gay people, I call them out on their bullshit. I don't care if they're my parents, I will not tolerate that behavior from ANYONE. "
"&gt; I think OP's wife just feels closer to her own biological daughter.

She choose to make DD her daughter. Imho, she took on the obligation to be a real mother to the girl. DD has done nothing wrong to deserve being treated this way."

"I fully expect retaliation. Not sure what kind exactly, but there's a 100% chance of Rob screaming and accusing me of being some sort of greedy fat cat. I feel their desperation increasing, so really can't predict their reaction at this point. Scary shit."
"can you and the other GF (assuming she is going to the actual wedding) book a room in the same hotel that night..go out for dinner and drinks yourselves and then just switch rooms so that you can be with your respective BFs, plus you get to know her better, so there will be someone else at the wedding that you know. "
"&gt; There's very little he can gain by telling the spouse

It's not about OP's gain here, nor is it about vengeance... it's about doing what is right.

The other guy's wife is ALSO a 'betrayed partner', just like OP.

She deserves to know..  how she reacts to that knowledge is up to her, but at the very least she deserves to know. 


"
"I disagree with all of this advice that says to talk to her. OP, you'll be able to see well enough if she acts a certain way to her husband in her own home or when they're together. If they are angry enough about it, they will bring it up on their own and apologize to you for having to listen. (This happened to my friend's wedding - lots of gay bashing and 'thanking' the couple for having a traditional marriage - and the couple personally apologized to many of us in the audience during the reception. Some of us walked out during the ceremony it was that bad.)

If a guest came up to me or my husband and said they had that much of a problem with our officiant's speech, I'd be embarrassed.

If your friend DID agree with his views, then you're going to make her explain herself, and then what, are you going to convince her to change her mind? If your friend DIDN'T agree with his views, then she would still feel embarrassed for having people disapprove of her ceremony too.

Your best bet is to watch her behavior going forward, and not visiting her or letting your kids visit her if you don't like what you see.

As for your kids, I figure you probably sat them down and said not everyone shares those views and why. If you didn't, you should."
So what was he supposed to do? I am honestly asking. She didn't like what they were doing naturally so she complained to him. He fixed the problem and then she complained because it was different. What else could he have reasonably ( and I stress reasonably) done.
"Clam shell top with hershey kiss nipples.

"I would bring up to Aunt Mom: why the fuck did she adopt you if she is going to be this spineless? Tell her that if she'd let another family, not related to bioMom, adopt you, that you would have to experience being thrown under the bus at every holiday. She made the choice to be your Mom, she should stand up for you. Not tolerate this bullshit. It's not okay that they spend the morning with you and leave you behind for the rest of the day. It's not okay that they host parties and invite people who force you to be alone. 

This is so fucked up, and I'm so so angry for you. "
"But what else are they supposed to do? If they bring up their concerns, no one is going to listen to them and he will just isolate her further."
He's not your boyfriend. He's a dude who's scamming you for money and probably already sleeping with other women.
Yes he should email the owners. But I also understand (though not applaud) his standing around wringing his hands. It's hard to believe the sky is falling when everyone around you is laughing.

"The quickest way to drive away your child is to try to force them from their partner.  Your MIL is a fool, OP.  Maybe one day when you have something she really wants, like a grandchild, you'll have some leverage with her, but right now it's your husband's battle.  It sounds like he is doing a great job."
"&gt;If in six years after cheating, she hasn't made you feel like the most desired guy in the world through her behavior, she hasn't been ""rebuilding"" properly-- _she's_ been wasting _your_ time.

This. Exactly this.  She's been wasting your time.  Also, don't stay for the sake of the children. Children sense when there is discord between their parents. Kids are a lot more in tune and smarter than you realize.  Your wife never owned up to her affair and instead threw blame everywhere else but herself.  Instead, she just smoothed it over and brushed it under the rug.

"Up voting this because this is really important. Human mouths are filthy, and our teeth are so blunt that breaking the skin is HARD. Just like a sharp knife does less damage than a dull one, a person biting you can mess you up.

"1. You did go behind her back.

"**You are both wrong**. 

You have each made a life-altering decision based on no evidence, just a hunch

Gather evidence.

Contact the school, swim team, whatever.  Talk to the other girl, parents, other kids.

The thing is, it is horribly common that the parents of bullies have no idea. Their child seems lovely to them, but is an utter shit to other kids. Learning that comes hard. But it happens. A lot. She may be an angel, but you need to know

Trust but verify. 

And if she is bullying, the punishment sounds about right. 15 year  old girls have been known to commit suicide over bullying.

"if you are depressed, it is situational depression from being with a horrible partner.

He is terrible. It is objectively crazy by all standards to read someone else's diary and make photocopies and keep them in a booklet making notes on it.

If it's so normal, why was he trying to hide it when you caught him? If it's so not a big deal, then why has he been doing it behind your back for three years? If it's such standard behaviour then why didn't he bring it up on date one or five or ten or anytime before or after marrying you as that totes normal thing he expects to happen in your life together. He knows he's wrong.

Sounds like she's unhappy with the present or she's unhappy right now and is desperate for a time when she was.

2004 was over ten years ago. That's a long time ago and a lot has changed. Wanting to go back to happier times means right now is unhappy time.

"Have you looked into positives for her year of pausing? Maybe there's trips she's been wanting to take, or useful classes she can take for her career, or similar jobs that she can pursue? Perhaps making these ideas into more concrete plans will encourage her."
"Not necessarily. It could point to depression or anxiety either. When I get really wound up and anxious, I start thinking that I'm a horrible person/why would anyone want to be with me/SO deserves better. My partner suffers with depression and at his lowest he will say something like that because he feels that I would do better on my own. 


Particularly the comment about sleeping for a few years points towards a mental illness. He's not satisfied about where his life is at and would like it to look radically different. Perhaps this new life can't take place with girlfriend in tow. If he's feeling trapped in his current lifestyle and she's the only good thing tying him to it, I can see why he would say consolation prize (although really shitty way to describe it). 

Dude needs to go to therapy and work on his issues.Depending on how long they are together, OP should consider letting him go."
"Definitely. Actually there are plenty of high functioning autistic women. Autistic women can actually get through life unnoticed because their symptoms present so differently and they are often just mistaken as shy, coy, quiet, nerdy, a little immature, etc. Women can mask and compensate for the symptoms better in many cases. Girl with autism are often diagnosed late, wrong, or not at all. There's a bias in how girls are diagnosed on the autism spectrum. It would not surprise me if she was high functioning aspergers or autistic. "

"This is very odd. It could be he wants to keep you close by sabotaging everything else and making you permanently indebted to him. 

Really, there is no easy way out without losing something. And I gather you'd rather keep your brother than the money you lost (so not going to suggest the obvious police call). 

With that in mind, personally I would take the money back without talking to him and say you found it in some obscure but believable place (tucked between papers in your bag perhaps). He'll know you know, so he'll dictate how it goes forward (does he attack you for it or feel humiliated and stop). 

Next, be VERY wary of him when you have an account. Create a savings account in one bank then have a main bank. Recreate all passwords and PINs. Money goes into your savings account, and you only ever spend off your small-holding cash account. 

Never save passwords on your PC for online banks, and if you ever go to his place then keep your bag (or at least your cards) on you at all times. "
"If you cannot get her into therapy, then you need to start planning on getting you and your child out that situation.

"Hi, OP! I think there's a lot that could be going on here but I just want to point out this bit. It may not be an issue, but just to make sure you're covering all your bases here:

*If she did why wouldn't she just say so? Like if she just wants to stay the way we are and skip the formalities. I have no problem with this.*

Does she *know* this? Have you told her? Because it is suuuper common in our society to feel like once the question has been popped and answered negatively that that's it, you're over, the relationship is going nowhere and the only alternative you have now is to move on. If the status quo was working great for her, you may have just sent her into a panic because she feels like she now has to either go through the huge bloody rigamarole of a wedding when she isn't ready or prepared to deal with it, or lose you completely. She may be trying to psych herself up to put herself through something she doesn't want to do because she thinks that you'll either want to end the relationship otherwise or will resent her for rejecting you.

If it's possible to send her some kind of positive reassurance while she's away to let her know that nothing has to change and you really mean that, this would probably be an excellent time to do it."
"Have you considered going to a parenting class? It doesn't make you a bad parent to admit that you need help- it just means you need guidance on how to talk to a growing kid, how to not lose your temper, and how to productively have discussions/punishments. If you aren't capable of having discussions, punishing and curbing behavior, you need to reach out and get real guidance.

"You don't really say, but I'm guessing your biological mother was somehow traumatized by your birth. If that's the case. it's understandable that she can't be around you.....HOWEVER, the fact that they allowed a family member to adopt you, rather than letting you go to an entirely separate family, means that the way they treat you is inexcusable. None of this is your fault, and they shouldn't be treating you like it is. 

I don't know what to tell you to do, but please try to give yourself a break. You haven't done anything wrong."
"ok, so


1) use hydrogen peroxide to get the blood stains out. trust me. I have saved so many cute panties that way. So many. It may mess with black fabric tho.


2) before I got it fixed, I filled like 2-3 overnight pads in a 6 hour day when I was bleeding, and even then, I only stained things other than my panties when I was sleeping (combo of not being able to change pads and weird positions tbh). Bleeding all over your shit is absolutely not normal, even for the most abnormal, the heaviest, or, hell, sporadic of periods.


3) how in the ass-loving, weed-blazing hell is asking someone to clean up their mess sexist? Is it sexist for me to ask a person to clean up their puke? no. Same goes for blood, no matter what orifice it's coming from, no matter why it's spilling. Ew.


If by some awful mistake you let her back in your house, seran wrap the seats. Maybe offer her an adult diaper. But, let's be honest here, the best decision is to not let her back in. She's all kinds of crazy.


Maybe sending pics of all the blood stains to your group would get them to lay off? like, maybe they don't know the extent of the bleeding...?"
"He's probably poring over them, trying to find ""evidence"" that you were there. "
Glad to see you're just as happy to throw your sister under a bus as Dan is to throw you under one.  You and Dan deserve each other.
"There's a few different issues in here, so I'm going to try to unpack them individually.

&gt; I don't know how to process what happened. I know that she was super drunk. I know that she was having fun and probably didn't mean any of it. I trust her, and I don't feel jealous or worried about any of her coworkers or anything. 

Issue 1: Clearly communication broke down as the night went on and on, but she clearly was not listening to your needs even before she got to the point of being drunk.  By the time she was drunk, you were stuck in a shit situation because the typical ""I'm drunk and having fun so I want to stay"" was playing out and of course you're not going to have fun as the only sober person in a group of drunks who you don't know.  I would also be careful about the issue of how restaurant people like to party (many restaurant people like to drink a lot, and make their main group of friends their coworkers.  I know that this isn't ALL restaurant people but it sounds like the case with this group....) 

*""Honey, I think we need to talk about last night.  I didn't enjoy myself.  Partially the reason I didn't enjoy myself was to be expected because of the situation.  Since I was driving and needed to work today, I wasn't able to drink and I had to be the only sober person who didn't know the rest of the group.  As the night went on, I was stuck in a Catch-22...you said I could leave since I did need to get home and sleep before work, but I felt like I'd be abandoning you at the bar after you had drank quite a bit and it didn't feel like a respectable move as your husband.  I'm not scared of you cheating but I felt like it would have been abandoning you and I wasn't comfortable with that feeling.""*

I'm a woman - when I drink at a bar or club, my best friend and I have a policy of coming together and leaving together so that we know that each other is safe.  There are some exceptions, but generally, we don't just abandon the other.  I appreciate that you didn't just leave her.  Your wife may disagree.  This is something that needs discussing though.

&gt; But I felt so disrespected. I felt like a fucking chump. I didn't say anything though because it was her first time out with her new coworkers and I didn't want to be that guy.

Part of this is your own self esteem.  You're not a chump.  Part of it needs to be dealt with.

However, if you're going to go meet up with these people again, you and your wife need to talk about how it's not fair to you if she just runs off and leaves you alone for long periods when you're at a bar together.  That's not to say that she has to be glued to your side, but it sounds like it got to a point where you were stuck just sitting around alone or chasing after her later.  There's a part of this where it is disrespectful to be abandoned and partially where you know that drunks are going to not be the best hosts.

&gt;But what the fuck? Does she still want to married to me, or is this a sign that she wants to branch out?


I don't think that this is a sign that she just wants to be divorced.  Are you on the same page with drinking/partying/staying near each other enough at parties?
"
"Um, I hate to break it to you, but things are not great in this relationship. Your girlfriend has a very warped idea about what a healthy serious relationship should look like, and has decided to stop taking care of her own needs and wants. Therapy, ASAP. For the two of you and probably for her, too. She sounds sadly misguided. I would also suggest that you have her talk to your mother about how your parents' marriage works.

I would also suggest, personally, that you stop agreeing to the sex life you're currently having. She needs to get in touch with her own needs again, and I think you should have brought up the sexual dysfunction a while ago. I understand she made it seem like ""normal"" generosity, but this is not making you happy."

OP, everything will change after having the baby. You might not feel up for a long flight with a six week old and leaving your daughter with other people for long stretches. It sucks, but your priorities are changing. You and your husband will be your own family unit, and putting the baby first makes sense.

Take care of yourself and avoid the stress. Send your sister and her fiancé a nice gift. Plan a long trip to visit with family a year or so after the baby is born. This trip will be better timed for you to actually enjoy it and spend quality time with loved ones."
"This might be an unpopular opinion but...

Look, I hate cheaters in anything (game, relationships, work, school, etc) but why the fuck did his sister rat him to the SCHOOL? What good would do that? That's just snobbish as hell.

At 17 years old you should have the common sense and she clearly knew what she was doing.

There was no lesson being taught there by his sister. It was just her snitching to the highest extent. At least if she ratted him out to their parents it would've shown that she was worried about his education and that they would be able to get through to him.

PS: I'm not a believer of ""snitchers get snitches"". I hate SNITCHERS but I do understand the many situations in life requires one to snitch on somebody else for the greater good. It's just this situation is completely avoidable if she snitched on him to the parents. "
"I think a book on modern etiquette might be more useful to your sister. She'll soon learn that rescinding invitations are extremely rude, one should never ever demand gifts and that getting married does not allow you to run roughshod over other people's feelings."

I'm just so nervous my sister is going to flip out on me..."
Your bf makes a valid point- it's super disrespectful of you to be excited about spending time with family. Have you considered locking yourself up in your bf's basement for the rest of your life so that you don't disrespectfully have life experiences that he's not a part of?
"Yes...you are right...you can't make your friends not sexualize your employee.

But you can speak up and tell them that what they are saying is inappropriate.  This has nothing to do with gender.  This has everything to do not having the brass to tell your friends they are out of line and acting disrespectfully.

Being respectful and having self control is a quality I seek out in my friends.  I guess some people are just ok with their friends being asshats

"I haven't seen anyone address this but what the heck is up with the other softball parents and/or softball coach leaving a 13 year old alone after the game?  Yes, dad is a jerk for forgetting to pick her up, but the larger issue is:

**Why did none of the parents or coaches stay with OP until someone came to pick her up?**

I can understand a little more if OP was 15-16, but a 13 year old has no business being left stranded at a baseball/softball field alone.    My parents would never leave one of my friends alone somewhere if their parents hadn't shown up to get them.  Hell, even if my parents were like that, I'd put my foot down and not leave until everyone has a ride home safely.  For the record, my parents would never leave any kids stranded if their parent's didn't show up to pick them up, we'd drop them off at home or have them hang with us until the parents showed up.  I literally cannot wrap my brain around grown adults leaving a young teenager alone.

OP, if your brother was a jerk, he wouldn't have dropped everything to come get you.  Ignore your sister, she's being a pill.  Meanwhile, I'd have your mom talk to your dad about this.  Being too wrapped up in his new girlfriend is not an excuse.  Thankfully nothing happened to you but things don't always work out as well as they did in this situation. "
"&gt;He texted back that he understands, but that she is pregnant and that I have a grandchild on the way.

&gt;...and that he hopes I will be in my grandchild's life.



No. No. Full stop, nope, no. 

Hi there, OP. You're going to be told this isn't your grandchild's fault -- *and this is absolutely true*. This is your ex and your son's fault. However, not only do they seem like the type to use a child against you and to try to strongarm forgiveness, a relationship and money from you because of the child -- **they already are**. Don't let any of them continue to emotionally manipulate you. Cut them out, cease contact, abandon ship. This is a really shitty thing they're doing.


If you feel like you HAVE to say anything, just tell him he's already violated your wish for space and to not contact you until you're ready, and because of that you have decided that you're cutting him  from your life, and that they are to cease and desist with any further attempts at contact starting now.


If/when the relationship blows up like explosions in a Michael Bay movie, you can decide if you want to be there for him or not. If the child wants a relationship with you as a young adult (16+) of their own will, you can decide if you want to pursue relations with them or not. But whatever you do, absolutely do not let someone use a child as a weapon against you. Whatever he says about the child in regards to you, do not respond. *Using a child as a weapon is one of the most disgusting forms of emotional manipulation that I can think of.*


And like others have said, please look in to counselling or therapy. It will help immensely with the healing process, which I wish you the best on."
"OP - you really can't be that dense, can you?

I just can't imagine the gall it takes to leave her 100% out of the business - even though she contributed to it.  

You really need to realize your actions made you look incredibly bad.  

Good for her for defending herself from someone trying to screw her over.  
"
"To be honest, if they divorce, it will not be because of you. It will be because Lauren and Frank discover they are incompatible with each other, and have irreconcilable issues with each other.

How Lauren treats you is an issue for Frank. But that doesn't mean *you're* the cause of the divorce. If you found out your best friend kicked kittens, would anyone say it's the kitten's fault that you ended the friendship?"
And don't get pregnant with him again.
"How is this not obvious? He is going the asshole route. Instead of breaking up with her like a grown ass adult, he making her feel terrible in hopes she will do his dirty work."
I agree. Hold the parents accountable for their kids and then maybe they'll parent the fuck out of her or get her some help.
"&gt;The difference between spending time with Ashley and then my wife just shows how much better my life could be


Yeah ok- Some 25 year old that didn't have to raise your child and only has to deal with the fun times with you- OF COURSE miss Ashley doesn't have to endure the stress of being married and the everything that comes with it. She can just have fun with you and not worry about your dishes, or aging, or being in marriage where her male counterpart wants to gallivant off with someone younger because he thinks she's less attractive because she's older.


Ashley probably doesn't have to clean up after you and here is some man that she is making feel important and 'special' because you are helping her build a computer. Of course Ashley is nicer to you, because she doesn't have to deal with the everything else your wife does. On top of that you are building her a computer and no doubt taking her out everywhere and telling her she is beautiful. 


Ashley just 'plans everything for me'. Sounds like that is what you are looking for. Someone to make your life easier. Probably doesn't help that your wife might be experience some early menopause and it doesn't feel great that her husband is probably treating her as if she isn't useful anymore because her looks are gone and you only expect her to clean up after yourself. "

"It means you'll be part of the divorce. 

I won't sugarcoat this, your sister is going to make this very difficult, from the sound of it. She is going to try and guilt you into going with her, but like everyone else has already said, her plans are selfish and, I'll go ahead and say it, idiotic. She wants to move to a crappy part of England while their economy is in turmoil. She isn't taking your education into consideration at all. 16 year olds are typically starting uni over there while you still have a few years of high school left. DO NOT go to England with her, please, I implore you.

For the sake of your future, I think you should take Frank up on his offer. From the sound of it, he's going to get full custody. He's the breadwinner, it's his house, and both of you should start documenting your sister's immature behavior immediately. Keep a journal. Be as specific as possible. Definitely mention that despite having no job or kids, she'll sleep until the early afternoon and do zero housework. Also that her laziness has interfered with your schoolwork. These facts are going to be very important during the custody proceedings. 

Also, prepare yourself for the possibility of your sister getting really nasty during the divorce. I'm not gonna lie, when I saw the title of your post, before actually reading it, I assumed it was going to be a story about Frank being inappropriate. Brace yourself for possible accusations of this during the divorce. She is going to try and smear his character to get her way."
"Don't waste your breath talking to your brother. Send an email to him reminding him of the money he owes, blind copy his wife and your parents.

Especially if you said you would pay for food just say feeding one girl is different then her and a man. But know how far you will take it if she calls your bluff and says if he doesn't come she can't. Only you know if that means she doesn't come or whatever other arrangement. 

Be prepared for him to call and constantly get in the way if he does not come. Making those threats is serious and should be answered with a call to an emergency help line. He needs to know the answer he will get is emergency professional help not a phone call with Sarah.  

It seems you already know but I will say anyway: he seems very manipulative and controlling. Be ready to listen to your friend and help her choose to do what is best for her. Even tho the answer is obvious to you she need some time away from him with a supportive friend to process. 

Good luck "
"How long has it been since you found out about the fellowship? Maybe she's just reeling from the realization but from the tone of your post, you might make her feel like her opinion doesn't matter to you even if that isn't your intention. Did you discuss moving before applying to the fellowship? 

I think it is an easy trap to fall into. During med school, you have to focus on studying and rotations. You worked for so long to get into medical school that it dictates where you live and what you can do for four years. Then comes residency. You don't even have a final say on where you go and your wife has been with you through this, supporting you and moving along with you. Now she might have been thinking that she finally has some agency and a fellowship takes that away(even if its only a year). So she is panicking. Give her a break, listen to her complaints and stop trying to tell her how important it is to you for just a minute. And quit using the term ""breadwinner"" think back to a time when you drag your sorry body home from the anatomy lab at 2 AM smelling like formalin and you still have to study for the rest of the weekend and your wife made you dinner and listened to you complain about your annoying classmates and professors and pretended to be interested when you were telling her about the intricacies of an EKG.

It might be good to just give her a little time and sit down and listen to her without trying to convince her to move. "
"Good for you man! The best most attentive parent I know is a stay at home dad to an almost one year old. 

&gt;He told me that the memories he has of having his mother (and specifically his mother, not just a parent) dedicate her time and devotion to him and his siblings were extremely valuable to him, and he wanted our future child to have the same memories.

OP, this is either a manipulation or your husband is extremely sexist. Do you really believe woman are more capable parents then men? Worst of all you have memories of your own stay at home father and apparently since they aren't your husband's memories they aren't valuable like his? So not only shouldn't you work despite making 3x as much as him, but your memories of your parents count less then his? 

Your husband wants your child to have a stay at home parent but isn't willing to change his life or give up anything. He thinks the woman should make this sacrifice because you're a woman. Maybe he just feels men should be the provider and so that's automatically his job, despite you being significantly better then him at it. Don't accept this BS. If he wants one of you to give up your career for 4 years it makes sense to be him; *both because it's better for the family financially and because it's what he wants for the baby*. Remember, it's also okay to use a child care center. Lots of families do and their babies are happy and healthy too. "
"as a mom of two also, Lily is an entitled c-word."
"Yeah but you began that talk with ""this is the massive invasion of privacy I just committed...""

You need to let her cool down and process the new information about *you* before you can really discuss this new information about her. Then approach from a position of compassion and care."
"View from my desk:  Pay yourself first.  Emergency fund first.

Scenario 1.  You have six months worth in an emergency fund.  Car accident - somebody's out of work for a few months.  You pay bills from your emergency fund.

Scenario 2.  Pay down debt, no emergency fund.  Car accident - somebody's out of work for a few months.  You call your bill people - they will not care that you made *a year's worth of extra payments* over the last four months.  You can't pay this month?  You're screwed.

Bills are managed by robots.  Take care of human beings first, robots second."
"Yeah, it's kinda adorable actually."
"I'm a veterinarian. I married a man who never had pets. I laid ground rules from the get go (my dogs sleep in the bed, for example). My husband is also OCD clean but would never act like this. If he gets weird, I remind him that I'm a veterinarian and he knew that when we got together.

It's not easy. Our tolerance is probably more than the next person (love me an abscess exploding...) so I get that there is give and take. But being married to a man who gets grossed out by anal glands, I can tell you it's still about respect. He respects my work. He respects me. He respects my relationship with my dogs, cats, ferrets. He also respects my long time away from the house and would never berate me for being exhausted and collapsing. He would just help me to bed (and probably Febreeze and scrub where I napped).

Friend, this won't get better. I did date someone like Matt. His BS was a deal breaker. Own your job and this type of life. It's what we as vets do and it won't ever be different.  PM me if you want to chat. It can be a difficult profession in ways people have no idea. Hugs."
"Boy, this really hit a nerve with you.  Parents want you to get a job too?"

"She didn't randomly get a tattoo. She has, by your own description, discussed this with you at various times and is fully aware of your opinion on the matter. And after weighing it all up, decided to get a small one.

"Your boyfriend sounds dumb, entitled, and whiny.

* First off, your brother is paying for this. So yeah, he absolutely gets to pick who goes. **IT'S HIS MONEY.** If your bf was paying, then he would get to pick.

* Second, your brother gave you this gift w/ your cousin because you both just graduated. It is a specific gift for the two of you for that purpose. So there's a reason he picked you 2

* Third, people in healthy relationships are okay with being apart from their SO. I just went on 2 weekend trips without my boyfriend. He was absolutely ok with it, because that is normal and healthy. 

* Fourth, it is totally BS for your bf to try to manipulate his way into a free trip by guilt-tripping you about **being given a gift**. It's not like you asked your brother for this and specifically said to exclude your bf. You didn't even expect this. Your brother was just trying to be nice, you had no control over it, and yet your bf is trying to act like you did something wrong. 

Are you sure your bf is 24 and not 14? I mean, come on. This is absolutely immature."
"Possibly. The teacher may decide to have a word with the mom before doing their job and calling CPS. It's one thing to report a child's parents when you see them maybe twice a year, and something entirely different when it's the nice lady that works in the room down the hall and shares grapes in exchange for your granola."
"This. I'd go one step further and tell him: I know our brother is a POS, so if you have questions either come to me or go check out Scarleteen. 

I also feel like a British person should provide OP with some good insults for the brother. Just feels appropriate and they're so good at them. "
I don't think this really qualifies as abuse. 
"I wonder if their relationship is strong enough withstand OP going threw all of her BF's devices and social media accounts and deleting every picture she is in, then ghosting him?"

"Not only that, but you paid for multiple uber rides for this chick, since he doesn't even work (or drive, or help you at home). This is ridiculous. Run away from this nightmare. "
Sometimes we do it together at events. But so one person has a chance to have a conversation or whatever without needing to worried about the kids. 
"Blaming the husband isn't advice, though. Telling her to talk to him about it before assuming too much is."
"I don't know if I can link in this subreddit, but google clipconverter to download the YouTube file before it can be deleted."
He should show her a video of her doing it if he really wants to jog her memory.
"True.  I would never date someone like OP's bf, even if he had never been caught.  I used to have some sketchy friends when I was in high school, and I've completely cut ties with them."
"I want you to realize something. 

Your mother is allowing you to be physically and emotionally abused by your father. Unless I missed something, she is doing nothing to stop him. Because he treats her like a princess, she allows you to endure abuse. She is an enabler. She does not deserve to be protected from the repercussions of her not stepping in. 

You may love your mother to the moon and back, but you can't set yourself on fire to keep her warm. Plus, when you're out of his reach, how much do you want to bet he's going to find someone else to abuse? Even if he treats your mother like a princess, who's to say he won't lash out at her when you're gone? You not filing a police report about this will lessen the chances your abuser faces consequences. 

PS: If your family would essentially disown you for standing up to someone who physically assaulted you, they do not deserve to be called your family. You can make a new family away from the people who abuse you and allow you to be abused. "
"His doctor should have referred him to a psychiatrist at that point.  HE needs psychological help as well as anger management.  Is this really what you want to raise your child around?  To be afraid and worried all the time?

HE has to be responsible for himself, and so far he is not.  You are well within your rights to tell him that proper steps to fix this are required for you to stay with him."
"$40,000 and there's only going to be 50 people...! That is ridiculously expensive and lavish."
"Older man with even older male friend offering young teen female with family issues a rich place to stay, sight unseen. Is it just me or does this scream potential for abuse? How many teens move out to an older boyfriend they really, really love, and find that he (or his ""friend"") is actually a pimp and is now calling in the debt for the nice things he's gotten for her after he's gotten her isolated away from family and friends? ""I really love you, baby, but now you have to pay me back, and this way is really easy. You'd do it if you love me...."" WAY too many. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch, sister.

Finish school. If you can't stand to be with your parents then get a job and a cheap apartment. Prepare to stand on your own two feet instead of relying on someone you fight with all the time and have only known for a few months... much less being dependent on someone you don't know at all (a friend of a friend is still a stranger!)  If he loves you, he'll keep in touch and wait for you. if he doesn't, he won't, and you'll be open for much better relationships.
"
"Your demands are something you have obviously arrived upon after a lot of thought. However, there's one EXTREMELY important facet it seems you've overlooked. 

**What do you have to offer in return?**

With the demands you make, you're targeting the top 10% of the male population. And due to the virtue of them being the top 10%, they are absolutely spoilt for choice. Why then, should they commit to you? What sets you apart from 90% of the women in world?

Let's go into further detail, and apply some of your demands on yourself.

* Are you a paragon of femininity, traditional or otherwise? Can you differentiate a dessert fork from a fruit fork? Can you prepare a 5 course meal, with only a day's preparation? Share anecdotes about your femininity, if my suggestions seem dumb.

* What about your own looks? Do you yourself possess a ""nice face and body""? You ask for a tall man, but do you possess a ""model body""?

* How independent are you? Do you have a place to call your own? Do yous till live with your parents? Do you have your own car? Do you pay your own housing, utilities and phone bills? Can you pay for yourself on dates? Or are you just looking for a guy who'll agree to be your ticket out of your current situation?

* How open are you yourself to having your views challenged. Can you engage in hour long debates, day after day, without taking any of it personally? Can you accept someone with different political and/or religious beliefs?

* What about your own sense of humour? Putting in all the effort gets old fast. Surely an amazing catch like yourself must have a highly refined sense of humour with a wide range. How often would you be the one acting a fool?

* Define intelligence. Do you mean college degrees? Will you disregard guys if they don't have the same level of education as you? Or if their major is something you don't perceive as ""intelligent""?

* So you don't want a doormat. Understandable. But how do you react when challenged? Will you accept a ""no"" gracefully? Will you respect his decision?

* This is something that you will have to spend a lot of time gauging. You'll have to witness it in action through smalls events, over time. Keep in mind that such a guy will also be monitoring you for such selfless actions as well. 

* So you don't want a virgin, and you don't want a player. You want someone who's *just right*. What about the guy's preference? You haven't mentioned anything about your own dating history. Strong guys with convictions *will* have opinions about their partner's history. Opinions you may not like.

* So you want a guy to commit to you, and be your dream guy. And then you want him to throw away everything he's built up and move with you to different countries repeatedly. All so you can have stories to tell and pictures to share. You realize that when guys like this decide to settle down, it's for the long haul? They put their days of fun behind them.

Would really love a response to this."
I think you and your sister have a severe codependency issue.
"I have paying fucking customers at the bar that will take my trash out when it's heavy. Husband here is a freeloader. She brings in more money and does almost all of the housework? I try not to go straight to break up, but I would have nexted him long ago. "
"Oh good grief. 

&gt; How can this relationship be saved?

You're asking the wrong question. You should be packing your bags and leaving him"
"Consider this: what kind of sane individual thinks they can pull a stunt like this on their SO without repercussions?

Your SO is either **incredibly** deluded (in addition to being selfish); of the opinion that he has you wrapped around his little  pinkie; or trying to push your relationship towards a breakup by denying you satisfaction, knowing full well that you won't take it sitting down.

Because no sane person would anticipate this course of action as going down well with their SO."

"Its obvious that he's comfortable with his brother randomly saying ""Where's horse teeth?"" Which tells me that her appearance is some sort of long running inside joke between them. So sick and sad for a person to be this way, it seemed like they had a great thing going on other than that."
"&gt;However, my mother wants me to walk my brother through some online courses which he needs to graduate.

This is code for: Just give him the answers so he can get a job long enough for us to justify kicking him out of the house without feeling guilty for it even though we both know he's a failure, he *will* fail, but I just don't want anyone blaming *me* when he happens to, and he *will* happen to, fail.

What you do with that information, is up to you."
Has the relationship between you and Callie changed? From your side or either hers? Does your wife see something you don't? I mean something had to come to a boil for this to happen out of nowhere. You really need to get to the bottom of what has changed her perspective on your friendship with Callie. 
"This needs to be the top comment. Forget counseling. Three years of this and more warning flags than domestic abuse victims normally get. Plus, you don't have children to worry about yet. "
"Is the restraining order still in effect? It's possible depending on wording that your mother could have broken it by being in the house even if your dad/step-mom are out of town. Your brother really needs to tell dad what happened, because he needs to know that his crazy ex-wife may still be trying to spy on him or damage his relationships with his children (I'm going to guess that her whole goal here was to get your dad upset with your brother and try to isolate him).

You can try and talk to your mother about her behavior, but given her narcissism, I don't think it's likely that she will listen. I think your efforts would be better spent trying to smooth things over between your father and brother once he finds out about mom staying over while they were gone."
"The cultural thing that you're not picking up on is that there are a lot of Americans who are just as ignorant of these things as you are, but instead of understanding that and asking people in an open and respectful way they decide to call people names and spread rumors. 

Also, the next time those bartenders give you shit about this, point out to them that they've been serving her alcohol often enough to know she's mentally disabled. If she can purchase and consume alcohol (I'm assuming with money she earned at her place of employment), then she can have all the sex she wants with another consenting adult. If she's *so* incapable of living a normal life and having relationships, then those bartenders are wrong for serving her booze in the first place. "
"Noah's behavior is not normal or acceptable. It's creepy and gross. If he's an exhibitionist who gets off on having an audience, that's fine and I'm sure he could find some fellow fetishists willing to indulge him, but just assuming his friends are cool with watching him have sex is waaaaay out of line.

You aren't unreasonable for asking your boyfriend to back you up here, and he's at fault for not taking your comfort seriously. I say that as somebody who did *not* grow up in a repressive religious household. "
"&gt;They thought that cousins were not respectful enough 

This is the issue. 

They may have been within their rights to decline to help your cousins, but it was in no way respectable. They have no claim on your cousins' respect. They still appear to think that those cousins owe them a relationship, and help in dealing with their own guilt. They haven't earned that. 

Your parents insist that they did what was right for themselves, and that they don't owe anyone an explanation or apology, which is true. But your cousins owe them even less, most certainly not respect or warm family feelings."
"Nah, he just sends her to live in a hut outside of town until her unclean time is over. "
"Solid response, I mean after after a year with the nanny, no problem,  and he even admits it was immediately following the conversation she overheard him participate in. What a goon."
"Ugh, these Stolen Valor nitwits are completely annoying. Chances are he washed out of Basic or got a General discharge and just can't let go.  If you tell her and she doesn't buy it, she can verify his military service via a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request. It's super easy to do, particularly since she knows all of his info from his tax returns, and she'll have a response within 3 weeks.  His SSN would be golden in researching the request.  

If he's in his 50s, chances are his ""records"" if they did exist, would be with the National Personnel Records Center.  I can't put a link, but google military personnel + foia and it's the first link.  I work at the NRPC, we receive requests like this ALL the time."
"She's scared -terrified in fact  - of losing her comfy life with a partner she has browbeaten into her perfect controllable minion.

"I've been told people can't see my OP.  I have no idea why, it's there but here it is copy and pasted.

As you can tell by the title, my Mom had me at a very young age. Obviously my Gran &amp; Granddaddy helped a lot in raising me. When you are a kid and don't know any different this is just your life so it never seemed weird to me. My Mom finished high school and started working while going to community college. When I was 10 my Mom and I got our own place (I'm pretty sure my grandparents still helped her get it but I don't care).

Anyway she has been an awesome Mom, she and I have always been close. BTW, in case you are wondering my Dad was never in the picture. I know him by name only and have never met him, it was just some boy who took advantage of my Mom and never looked back.

My Mom is very beautiful, she is really young but honestly she could easily pass for someone in their 20's. Because of her past she has always been very shy about dating and in all of my years on this planet I have only ever met two men she dated and both of them were short meetings where I kind of forced myself into a position to meet them.

Basically over the past few years she pretty much as given up on dating. I hate how this makes her feel about herself, she is so vibrant and beautiful. At her age many women are just starting to get married and have kids and she doesn't come with the baggage of a divorce or ex's. She does have a full grown Daughter but I think I'm great. lol.

Anyway I met Bob at work. Bob is 35 and is breathtakingly handsome. I mean he literally is a dead ringer for Steven Pasquale (if you don't know him he has been on Rescue me &amp; Bloodlines) in fact the first time I saw him at work I honestly thought it was him.
Anyway we start talking one day and it is kind of obvious he is flirting with me. Hell I'm flirting with him. He asks me out for drinks and of course I can't go because I'm not legal but I agree to go grab coffee with him.

As I sit there gazing at him and all of his glory it strikes me that he and my Mom are the same age. Don't ask me why but at that moment it was as clear as crystal to me that he was to old for me although physically I have never been more attracted to a guy.
So during the talk I started to change the nature of our conversation and I stopped flirting with him and started to ask him personal questions. I'm sure this set him back and probably offended him but now I went from wanting to hook up with him to interrogating him to see if he was good enough to be with my Mom.
I actually had a recent photo of me and my Mom and showed it to him and he would not believe me that this was my Mother and kept telling me that it was my Sister. I then told him our life story and told him that I thought he would be great with my Mom.
The look on his face was priceless. It was a combination of amusement/bewilderment/offended and disappointed all at the same time. I am sure he thought he was well on his way to hooking up with a much younger woman (which btw he was) only to be given a detour to an older one.

So he admitted that this wasn't what he was expecting but sure he would be happy to meet my Mom.

I didn't even give my Mom any warning, I just showed up at the house and said ""Oh btw there is a guy coming over in about 45 minutes to take you out to dinner"". She spent the first 10 minutes yelling at me only for me to tell her he would now be here in 35 min.

He shows up at the a few min. early and I let him in. My Mom comes out and meets him with a smile to his face and gives me an evil Mom eye while he isn't looking.

They go out for dinner and 3 hours later they come back.
My Mom was glowing. I mean she was smiling from ear to ear when she came in the door and at first I thought she was going to completely forget about the surprise I set up for her. She didn't but did say she could forgive me because this guy was and I quote ""so dreamy"".

At first I was thrilled. I am so happy for my Mom, she deserves it because she has had such a hard life.

They have been going out for 3 weeks now.

Here is where I turn into the shitburger daughter. I am so jealous I can't see straight. Every time I see him all I want to do is rip off his clothes and have him throw me into bed. I know, I am horrible.
I came home this past weekend from hiking with friends to see his car in the driveway, no big deal I figure they were going to go somewhere. But I obviously interrupted their pleasure as my Mom comes running out of her bedroom with her skirt on sideways and her hair looked like she had been riding in a convertible with the top down. She at first tried to blow it off like she was cleaning or some such stupid shit but even she knew she sounded dumb and then started glowing red with embarrassment. She just slinked back into her room.

I then proceeded to go to my room and cried for a half an hour out of pure jealousy and rage.

How do I get past this. I love my Mom. I want this for my Mom. I would never EVER do anything to hurt my Mom.

But there is a part of me that feels like I made a huge mistake and I am passing up a guy who would have wanted to be with me and I think we would have been great together.

tl;dr: Turned down opportunity to date very handsome man because I wanted my Mom to have someone. They met and clicked, now I am filled with jealousy and rage.
"
"I don't think we're getting the whole story, but I also don't know if you know the whole story either. They blow up and deflect when you suggest Bob's Burgers, which I would assume is their kind of humor anyways. They keep accusing her of being stuck up and thinking she's better than them. I think this isn't about not watching what they want at all, and more about not liking your wife and thus not feeling any desire to accommodate for her "
"&gt;My boyfriend plays for a pro basketball team.


Sounds like he wants someone to support his career, thus the comments about marriage (ie if she's on the road so much how will she keep house/attend my games/watch the kids/support my career/etc)

Could just be a guess.


He is old enough to *know* that this is a wrong way to treat someone, and a wrong way to handle conflict. That said, 30 year old men who date 19 year olds aren't generally known for their maturity. I also doubt his family considers your relationship serious enough to even discuss given this age gap.


What exactly are you getting out of this relationship?"
"Girl you doing some crazy projecting in this thread. Your experience with weightloss post-pregnancy will not be universal. There's no reason OP shouldn't try, especially given that she was a fitness lover in the first place "
"I'm taking it there was an implied ""solely"" in the post. Ideally both parents would do the raising."
"Yeah, it's weird that your boyfriend sees your brother as a romantic threat. Like...no!!"
"Good lord, you work with Dwight.

Your boss needs to get control of her employees.  Marty needs to get his shit together.  If your boss has your back, next time Marty makes a snide comment, call him on it.

""Marty, given your obsession with documenting what I do all day and passive aggressive insults, I think it's time to meet with the boss together.  Are you available tomorrow at 8 AM?""

Call his damn bluff on it and bring this issue to the spotlight."
"Don't feel guilty. You found out her true colors before marriage and are dodging a bullet.

Think about it like this: years from now you have a son, and he came to you with thus exact issue. Would you blame him, or would you tell him that he's better off without her? 

Trust your gut.  Your ex fiancee is shady with her past, is bad with money and felt entitled to your money. She's now badmouthing you. Nope out of there."
But his lack of maturity is really atypical for a 31 year old
"I'm with the brother. I wouldn't want to deal with that bullshit either. If you want to try, your fiance has to reach out to his brother and try to repair things. His brother still may not want to come. Actions have consequences, more news at 11."
He probably thought you were hot and didn't want his gf to think he was interested in you.
"If two dates a week, weekly gifts, love letters, silly poems left in her car, daily foot rubs and massages as we spend time together, dinners made for her, days where I tell her that her chores will be mine for the day so she can just relax are not enough for her, I don't know what is. If it's not enough, she needs to tell me that instead of asking me to cut out a very important friend, who only gets a fraction of my time, while my wife gets most of it (as she should, because she's my wife)."
"Personally I think 9 is old enough to explain racism and what not. I also think when she gets older she'll feel shame and regret about the request, like asking basically her father figure to not be seen in public with her because he's brown. She'll grow up and reflect and probably regret it. So I think it's best to explain (with help of the child psychologist) and try to give her some perspective and empathy. I understand you want to protect her as well, but racism is a part of society and we cannot shield children forever. Tamir Rice was a child when he was shot by the police(not comparable just saying racism is a reality despite the age of the child). "
"No, seriously though...

If she didn't realize what was watching and assumed it was gay porn...

He waits for the second she leaves to watch gay porn, she might be worried he's secretly gay or something. 

She needs to come back so they can talk."
"I get that worry, I really do. If things ever get really out of hand, though, remember that ultimately, he is not your responsibility. He is an adult and he's responsible for himself. You don't have to accept abuse from him, and if it comes to the point where his behaviour is significantly damaging to you, it's okay to draw a line and cut him out of your life. "
That was my first thought. Who the hell thinks 15 minutes is taking too long to orgasm?
"DO NOT RETURN THE GIFT. That is tacky and super ungrateful. As others have pointed out you could spend a portion of the money on a nice event for you and your friend. That would be a nice way to show your appreciation for her friendship without being condescending about the gift. I'd recommend living social or groupon for a fun activity and make it a fun girls night. 

Also, keep in mind you don't know the intricacies of her financial situation. For all you know, she could have purposefully saved up this money, received it as a gift from other family, or a number of other scenarios. The end result is she wanted to give it to you. Don't doubt her judgment. "
"Very true. About 5 years ago, a 6-year-old boy who lived in my community passed away after falling from a ladder. It was such a heartbreaking and tragic situation. 

OP &amp; husband are very lucky that brother's quick response saved their child from being hurt. "
"Wow. You need to stop this open relationship NOW. Maybe stop the relationship all together. You are in need of therapy, because if you are on the verge of cutting yourself something is very wrong. You should seek out help ASAP. 

I don't know if the relationship problems can be resolved, but you guys have no business being in an open relationship. To opening up a relationship should be fun and feel good on both parts. This is just a cluster of mess. Please, please seek help. "
Of course. But I'm willing to bet money they haven't been dating for nearly long enough to produce a stable marriage. They've had three months of openly dating; the rest was all cheating. 
"This is a brave post, you may get heat for possibly damaging this poor child's psyche.

You have a big cross to bear, that's a hard burden to support &amp; see everyday. He is a reminder of all your pain &amp; heartache, that was unfairly thrust upon him.

Maybe being instinctively kind will come naturally in time, but you might need to work hard to make that happen or it never will. You need to find some way to bond with this kid, perhaps without verbalising it to him you could take him under your wing as the only other innocent victim in this whole mess (well apart from your own kids). He has been abandoned by his mother &amp; will probably grow up to hate her as much as you do. Is there any hobby or interest you wanted to share with your kids, but they weren't into it or are too old now? If you can capture some joy in being with him as a little kid before he is old enough to process the gravity of the sad story behind his birth, then maybe there is hope.

But if you can't be kind to him &amp; he suffers emotional abuse/neglect then this living situation will become very ugly in years to come. You should be praised for this sacrifice you've made to give this kid a home under the circumstances, but I wouldn't recommend this living situation if these feelings of hostility persist &amp; you can't cope."
"I think the fact that you've chosen the username you have, spend most of your post talking about Callie and not your wife, use almost every comment in this thread to be defensive about Callie and try to paint yourself as the 100% perfect husband suggest you've already decided.

You have been more than patient and understanding trying to explain how you feel and get him to talk about this so far. You have every right to bail immediately. If you want to take one more shot at working this out, for some reason, tell him his options are a breakup or immediate couples therapy. And no blowjobs for him until that occurs!

"Google the fuck out of this guy and if OP can afford it, put an investigator on him too!"
"&gt;My boyfriend will often complain about how we can't afford nicer groceries from Whole Foods or other specialty stores, because I'm paying half and my half just won't cover it. I've mentioned that he can pay for what he wants, but he just says that we need to split it and he knows I can't afford it.

&gt;He has also mentioned recently wanting to move to a nicer apartment in a nicer part of town. He has even toured a few places and leaves print outs on top of my lunch for work.

Why does he insist on splitting everything so equally even though it's obviously making him unhappy? Even if it's ""50/50"" you're still being left will way less income than him at the end of the day if he makes much more than you. So maybe rent is $1000 and you pay $500 and he pays $500, but maybe you only make $1000 a month and he makes $10,000 a month. You're left with $500 to spend and he has $9,500. This situation is a significant disadvantage to you. Splitting 50/50 sounds great in theory, but it's not always the best. You guys definitely need to work out a different money managing arrangement, because neither one of you sounds very happy with this one.  

Also leaving apartment printouts is a very passive aggressive move. He clearly isn't okay with the way things are working now or the lifestyle he's trying to live. It isn't your fault that you can't keep up with his wealth, but he is pinning everything on you as to why you can't do certain things when he has the means to. He's telling you he wants things to be fair then complains about wanting more, but won't put anything more on the table. If he really wants his $10 asparagus water from Whole Foods then he can go get it himself without needing $5 from you. You have way more patience then I would have. "
"Don't automatically jump to this being a huge mistake that you married him. If he hasn't shown any other signs of controlling behavior, this is the wrong conclusion to jump to. It sounds like you have been through a lot, but remember that HE almost lost his baby twice, too. I'm not discounting what you've been through but he is probably also very stressed out about having a new baby, a sick wife, and is worried about the both of you. Talk to him about your concerns once everything cools down. You guys need to have an open discussion. "

You think people will know ""we did what guys do after watching porn"" means ""we were laughing and joking about what we had seen""? What the fuck?

For what it's worth, one dude asking to see the size of another guy's dick is pretty gay. And super not normal. And then standing up on your bed naked and helicoptering in front of your male friend is also pretty gay. And also super not normal. 

So the reaction from your parents was actually pretty normal, given the circumstances. 

Just be happy that they'll accept your sexuality whenever you come to terms with it. "

"I think your girlfriend should be more concerned than angry. It worries me that any 52 year old woman would pick up on a 20 year old. It's wrong for her to blame you- I'd think any 50-something woman who slept with someone who was barely older than a teenager had a screw loose. Hopefully with some time to cool down she can try to have a calmer perspective- perhaps her initial anger was just from the shock because I know I would be very surprised if I heard a guy list off those ages. 

The mom comment was a low blow and uncalled for, like the male equivalent of 'daddy issues' and it's not fair for her to react that way. Just because you don't have a nurturing mother and slept with older women doesn't make you weird, there is nothing wrong with you, don't let your girlfriend belittle you and call you names. You're dating a 22 year old woman now so it's obvious not all relationships you seek come with a big power imbalance or age difference and maybe it was just an exploration phase you were into at the time. It's hard to say. 

I think it can definitely still work if your girlfriend is willing to let go of her anger and maybe discuss her feelings with you in a calm way. She's probably having a hard time absorbing that the guy she cares about deeply was with a woman 30 years older than her- anyone would have lots of questions on that topic and might worry."

"calling you a ""used up old granny"" sort of destroys any credibility she might have otherwise had; i would be surprised if this email's contents aren't embellished.  her motivation is obviously only to get to you, and to insert herself (once again, because i guess sleeping with your husband wasn't enough for her) into your marriage.

if you're truly interested in working out your marriage, remind yourself that she didn't tell you anything you didn't already know.  bracelet aside (if that's even true - IF), anything she told you they 'did together' are things i'm guessing you've already imagined, or intentionally forced yourself NOT to imagine - but there's no ""news"" here.  it's just a bitter little shrew (hey, i can call names too!) who is incapable of getting her own man, and sad and angry because she 'lost'.

if you respond at all - and i don't recommend you do, but just for the sake of fantasy - it should be something along the lines of ""from one 'used up old granny' to someone who one day will be likewise, my advice to you is to move on, develop enough of a personality that you might eventually attract your own man, and hope to christ you don't end up twelve years later receiving a cowardly anonymous email such as this one when you're trying to salvage your marriage after some stranger saw fit to insert herself into your life.  good day.""

btw, i suppose if there's any good news here, it's that you know he clearly isn't fucking her any longer.

"I am so angry with your girlfriend.

""Yes"" is an acceptable answer.
""No, I don't think that's what I want right now"" is an acceptable answer.
""No, honestly I'm not sure I will ever want us to be married"" is an acceptable answer.
Even ""No, and actually we need to talk because I don't feel the same any more and I think we should break up"" is a sad but acceptable answer.

""No"", then running away and refusing to talk to you is not an acceptable answer. It's incredibly disrespectful to your relationship. There is no valid reason to treat someone you supposedly love in this way.

Tell her it's okay she turned you down, that it's okay if she doesn't want to get married now or (assuming you *are* okay with it) doesn't ever want to get married. Tell her whatever is wrong, you're there to support her. If she is just undecided and needs time to think about it, let her have as much as she needs without bothering he with this subject. But do *not* accept completely refusing to communicate. If you don't talk, it's going to end one way or another. If that's what she wants, she should say so and not mess with you."

"I don't think you did anything wrong, and I'd love to have a partner that was a more aggressive negotiator because I suck at it.  The owner of the boat had the option to say no.  He didn't. He knows what his break even is and clearly you didn't reach it or he'd have said no. Your boyfriend sounds unreasonable, though I find this to be pretty common in people who haven't spent much time in cultures where bargaining is a way of life.

You're right that this is a cultural difference and I personally don't think you should have to change it.  However, there can be such a thing as going too far.  There's even a TV show about it that is totally cringe worthy and I would be embarrassed to be in a relationship with people who took it to extremes.  Those people tried to negotiate EVERYTHING, which is just too much for me.

Do you bargain for everything or just stuff like this?  If it's just stuff like this, perhaps you can come to an agreement about what things you're allowed to negotiate for and what you're not?  But, money problems are one of the leading causes of divorce, so if you have significantly different ways of handling finances and can't come up with some kind of agreement, then I don't see this working long-term."
"After OP described her friend and her behaviour, I immediately thought it was for this exactly why the other people ""kicked"" her out but made it seem like they wanted an art room, I mean two days. They were probably sick of her shit and couldn't take it any longer, just like OP."

And then after people agree she is a sweet soul and maybe all the sport isn't doing her well, in THIS post you start up with ""Idk why everyone thinks my gf is sweet. She's a sore loser and she sucks at sport"".

It's clear your GF hates competition and the trash talking. And she's NOT great at sports. Yet from your two posts it sounds like all you guys ever do is play basketball together.

Why don't you do something else together? Bowling, card games, xbox, idk? Your gf probably feels embarrassed that you had to tell your brothers to stop picking on her and so she's lashing out right now. She likely only ever played sport with you to begin with to feel included, make an effort and be nice, and now your brothers have GFs who are as competitive as the boys she feels inadequate and feels like she has to try harder to be more like them - the cool sporty type - even though she's not and it upsets her. I mean even you call your gf out for ""sucking"" at sport and say you're worrying about being a ""crybaby"" for just asking to quit the trash-talk, you don't sound very supportive of her at all, and she can probably tell very clearly that you're embarrassed of her.

"- If your husband is awake, he cannot *fathom* someone else wanting to sleep. So he behaves as if that's not the case, and gets away with it.

- If your husband would never do something, he cannot *fathom* someone else would. This time he cannot ignore the discrepancy, he cannot comprehend why someone would behave differently from him, and he freaks out over it.

Hypotheses:

- Your husband has no empathy.

- He sees his own feelings, experiences, opinions as *objectively correct*, other ones do not exist (are ignored).

- He cannot handle a different point of view that cannot be ignored. He *must* understand before he can accept, but has limited capacity of doing so due to his lack of empathy. So he (and you) get stuck in a loop."

He comes for sleepovers with his own food and we supply the junk food he can eat.  Pretzels, most candy, and soda.  Never a problem, and no drama.  Well except for the time my husband mixed up his hot dog buns with ours...so I drove over and picked up some more untainted ones.  Still not the kid's fault...it was totally our mistake.  We were one of only three houses their parents could trust for a sleepover.  It was really tough for the kid for a long time.  Now they are all teenagers and nobody cares.

You need to start being the fun house.  Start having regular events and inviting kids over to hang out in a safe food environment.  Put together board game nights with the parents and have them see your safe, child friendly place that would be perfect for sleepovers.

I'll give you some perspective: When I was a kid, about 12, my friends' mom had the get that same surgery. So me and my friend spent all day while she was in the hospital cleaning, making space, moving things around so she could reach them, ect. *I as a child did chores for my friends' mom when she had surgery...* Your own husband can't even claim that he cares as much as 12 year old me for someone I'm not even related to.


 His standards for a comfortable living space are much lower than yours. Instead of compromising, he's been neglecting everything because he knows you'll do it because you want your space to be comfortable.

Have you asked yourself why without chalking it up to ""oh well he's forgetful and easily distracted""? Don't give him excuses.

I took breaks after my kids were born (about 4-5 months afterwards) and during my pregnancies because I was fucking exhausted, and I don't always get there as often as I'd like, but it's goddamned *necessary* to have time for oneself, especially as a parent, *especially* especially as a stay-home parent. 

Plus the kids get socialized. 

Anyway, OP should definitely get back to the gym. Not only for her own health, but because she enjoyed it.

I just made my dog a facebook. We comment to each other a lot. She mostly complains about our other dog. 
"First of all, their divorce is **not your fault**. Your sister is choosing to do what she does, and it is her behavior that made Frank upset. This is probably an issue that predates you by a long, long time. It has nothing to do with you.

Second, it is okay if you take his offer. You have to do what is best for you, and that means keeping yourself stable for the sake of your education and your future. If Frank is willing to take you in, and you are willing to live with him, I would seriously consider it.

Some things to think about -- who is your legal guardian? As in, what does the paperwork say? Do you have people in the US to turn to in case Frank realizes he doesn't actually want the responsibility of raising a teenage girl who he isn't actually related to? 

I just want to say that you seem like a wonderful young woman. Best of luck to you, I'm so sorry that you're going through all this."
"I'm not sure he's planning to trade her in. I think he's trying to keep her off balance, insecure, on her toes. If she's always worrying about whether she's good enough for him she won't have time to wonder whether he is good enough for her."

"For future reference, as someone with severe dietary restrictions, it is always in your best interest to disclose that you are not eating something for medical reasons and not because you don't like it. People are more likely to respect your diet that way, and they will not continue to pressure you to 'just try some!' Plus, you know, you won't come off as a petulant picky eater. Not that she's justified in viewing you that way, but if she has no idea you have a medical condition you should probably make her aware of that and apologize for the misunderstanding (not that you necessarily need to apologize, but it's a show of good faith to do so).

""Hey [BROTHER'S GF], I'm really sorry but I thought you knew that I have a medical condition that seriously limits my diet. I thought [BROTHER] had mentioned it, and it's not something I like to talk about while people are eating. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, and I never meant to insult you at all, there are just a lot of things that I can't eat.""

And if she doesn't accept then fuck her."
"&gt;We have been in therapy since the day after she told me, 2 times a month

What does your therapist say to do? I mean, it's great to get anonymous opinions online, but if you trust this therapist, I'd ask for his take and follow his advice.

&gt;I worry my wife's motivations to NOT tell his wife are poor: to save her own reputation, and because she cares about this guy and his feelings. 

Again, what does the therapist say? Have you brought this up in session? 

And what does you wife say when you ask her why she doesn't want you to tell the other man's wife? It feels like your words above are your own conclusions, not her words."

You make $90k/year and ~$700 is basically ruining something you've been planning for months. It is beyond poor planning when you still don't realize that you couldn't afford this wedding.

"It's very ""special"" that she gets a night for herself after being *patently rejected* by her entire family. Her husband's family, her husband (who chose to leave her behind), and her children! How special for her."
"You're the epitome of why people have trust issues. Your wife thinks you're honest and thinks she is in a great relationship when you're hiding life changing things behind her back. If you're lying about this positive thing then what negative things are you keeping secret? Grow up and learn to be honest with the one person who should know everything about you. If I were your wife I'd be pissed and question everything. Also, having money doesn't mean your kids have Gucci brand items. You don't automatically have a different lifestyle when you have money and you also don't have to tell your kids anything. You think kids know how much their parents have? Maybe an idea but they don't need to know."
"To add to this, you don't need to inform your children of the details of your finances. The only time that is important is if your quality of life is going to decline, not improve. They might ask if you buy them something pricey, but really kids just care that they can go to college. 

If this affects their ability to get college financial aid I suggest to re-evaluate your college strategy ASAP. Federal aid, including loans, are usually only made available for people under a certain income bracket--- you could end up having to pay everything out of pocket if they don't get academic scholarships (which are need blind, meaning they don't discriminate against people with higher incomes).

There are college funding options, but it's best to explore them in advance so you aren't scrambling and missing deadlines later. Some states have ""prepaid"" options for state schools, and it'll cut costs into a fraction of the cost- and usually it works for any state school or can be applied to private institutions (though it doesn't go as far, obviously because of cost differences)."
"It was probably smegma, in which case he just needs to wash it off and pay more attention to cleaning himself down there. As for him crying... woah buddy get a grip."
"It's a bit of a concern that she doesn't feel comfortable enough to discuss her psychiatrist with you. That's probably something worth getting out on the table. Obviously, be tactful - this is something that you probably know better how to bring up than strangers on the internet.

If she's only going once a month though, she's almost certainly seeing a psychiatrist and not a therapist. This is a pet peeve of mine about the mental health industry, but a psychiatrist's job is really frequently interpreted to mean, ""diagnose a problem and prescribe a solution."" A lot of them meet their patients once a month for about 45 minutes to check that the drugs aren't hurting them, consider upping the dose, make a little small talk and write the next month's prescription. There isn't a lot of talk therapy going on there usually, and it sounds like your wife could use some talk therapy.

It's really hard to talk people into making changes like this, especially if she's already not telling you about her psychiatrist. My only suggestion is that you suggest couple's therapy and go from there. Obviously the weight is going to come up, and this is probably a good time to talk more openly about the issue and encourage her to make some of the changes that she *should* make, for her own sake."
But she did 'know'. She was just lied to. This wasnt on her.

"Sooooo I have an uncle who decided to go to prison instead of snitching on his friends. My uncle is also ""innocent"". But he didn't want to snitch. 

He went to prison. Several years later, out of prison, he is a felon. Can only obtain really shitty jobs. Has ruined his life. His ""friends"" who he refused to snitch on has nothing to do with my uncle and they aren't even friends anymore. So he fucked over his life and future from a bunch of shitty people who he doesn't even talk to.

Your husband is being a fucking idiot. He is ruining his own and YOUR life by doing this. 

That said, I don't buy it for a minute that your husband is actually innocent. He had a hand in this, in some way. He participated to some degree and IS guilty, to a degree. Don't be so naive. You said it yourself that he was involved in shady illegal shit when he was younger. It's not that crazy to believe he would slip up and do it again.

So either your husband is stupid, guilty, or both. Do you really want to stay with a guy like this? Who does illegal shit and/or is willing to fuck up your guys' future because he can't get his shit together? Either way, he's choosing his shitty friends over you. He sounds like a real winner, OP."

"&gt; Jon is constantly frustrated and worried about it, but for reasons I don't fully understand either I think he carries a lot of guilt and has felt responsible for him for most of their lives. He doesn't like him at all and is upset by him on a daily basis, but feels like he's somehow his ""responsibility."" I've asked about this a lot and Jon is always like ""I know, it's horrible, I don't know what to do, but he has no one else."" (To which I kind of say FINE, I DON'T CARE, LET HIM FIGURE IT OUT ALONE but I think Jon just feels trapped or something.)  
I'm really hoping that him moving out gives us a little bit more space to exclude him

Out of curiousity; if Jon feels obligated to take care of Brian (for some **preposterously** insane reason), why do you think that will end once you move out?

If he genuinely thinks ""I know Brian is horrible but I don't know what to do because he has no one else and I feel trapped"", then why do you think those feelings of his will go away or dissipate once you've been able to put some distance between him and Brian? Isn't a more likely scenario that Brian will just show up at your house? Kind of like he did at Rachel's house?

&gt; But I'm really troubled by things like him showing up at Rachel's house - feels really invasive and like he's trying to let us know that he can't be got rid of.

You should be troubled. If he had *absolutely no qualms* about showing up to the house of Jon's cousin totally unannounced (someone with whom he DOES NOT have a personal, one-on-one relationship), don't you realize that he'll **definitely** have no qualms about showing up at YOUR house?

What, out of all the behaviour that Brian/Jon has shown, makes you think that *any single aspect* of their relationship will change once you move in to the new house? Brian has shown that he's a selfish asshole who doesn't give a single, solitary fuck about other people's boundaries, and Jon has shown that he doesn't care that Brian is a garbage human being and he's willing to bend over backwards and inconvenience *everybody else* for the sake of ""taking care"" of Brian. Brian's not going to change, and if Jon is adamant that he's ""Brian's keeper/guardian/parent figure"", why would moving somewhere new change that?

Also: I'm really, REALLY curious about Rachel's reaction to Brian showing up. Have you talked to them since the weekend?"

"If that kid is the little shit you know she is, she probably still has it hidden somewhere. No way would she get afraid and toss it when she already had it hidden and no one knew (until she got questioned). I would have SIL pay for everything her kid broke. Also I would demand to go through the kid's belongings while she is out of the house so you can search for the ring (don't let the kid know you're going to do this though, otherwise she'd might toss it for real. Search through her dolls/doll accessories, her purses/wherever she hides valuables. This probably isn't the first time she's stolen something and stashed it."

"&gt; when I did confront the bride to be about her actions, she turned it around and said she's a big supporter of us and that SHE is the one feeling anxious around my gf. She also provided some flimsy reasoning behind not allowing certain SOs to stay at the hotel. I don't understand or care at this point.


I can somewhat sympathize with the bride. It sounds like this is the kind of wedding that the bride and groom have tried to meticulously plan and are now getting very stressed about, and this situation probably doesn't seem like as big of a deal to them (compared to a bunch of other wedding stresses they are probably experiencing) as it does to you. Additionally, given that OP has been yelling at strangers on the internet in this thread... I can imagine your interactions with the bride/groom on this matter might have been stress-inducing, too. 

Just keep in mind that you don't *have* to make this a huge deal. You don't *have* to be offended for life and cast out these friendships as a result of this. You *can* just take the practical steps you need to (like booking your own hotel room with your gf for the night), then practice some forgiveness and just - in the immortal words of Elsa - let it go.

Most weddings are planned and budgeted over a year in advance. A groomsman's girlfriend of 7 months not being invited to a rehearsal dinner is not a social faux pas. A bride and groom offering to pay for hotel rooms for certain attendees, but not extending that offer to more attendees than they are comfortable with (whether they can afford it or not) is not a social faux pas, either. 

Banning a groomsman's girlfriend from being in said hotel... sure, that is a social faux pas, but are you absolutely, 100% sure that your communication with the bride about this has been perfect? There's a big conceptual difference between ""Groomsman, I don't want your girlfriend to hang out in your room at the hotel"" and ""Groomsman, I don't want to pay for your girlfriend to have a room at the hotel"" ... but talking about one could very easily be mistaken for the other if your communication has not been detailed and perfectly clear. 

If you really want to villify your friends and have a dramatic post-wedding fade-out from their lives... well, fine, go for it. But I would counsel you to make sure that you're doing it for the right reasons, not because of some perceived-but-not-actual malicious slight that should really have just been explained, forgiven and moved past."
"From your description any time there was a conflict or something unpleasant to deal with you just avoid her or talking about it. Your examples of her being mean, is you made a mess in the kitchen and didn't' clean it up and she got mad. I would be too. Her behavior escalates because you have only confirmed or materialized her original insecurities by dating some one a lot younger than her. 

Having an open marriage doesn't let you out of the marriage. How often have you and the wife gone out together, on a date or a date night? 

Even now, rather than talk to her about these problems, you are just avoiding her even more. If you are going to leave, just do it and stop stringing her along with one foot out the door. "
I needed internet strangers to make me realize what I've known in my heart since this all started. See my edit in the OP.

"I think you're wrong about why Frank is livid - it's not the condition of the house that's the problem. It's that his 16-year old orphaned SIL is picking up the slack for his useless, lazy wife. Essentially, you're acting like a mature adult while your sister is acting like an immature kid. None of this is your fault. 

Keep doing the chores that you consider your fair share. Be a good roommate, and plan you future carefully. Try to stay out of conflict with your sister, but by no means trust in her to take care of you financially or emotionally. It sounds like she may want  you to keep living with her post-divorce so that she has access to the funds that your parents left you. In her fantasy European future, I highly doubt that she's envisioning working hard to support the two of you. "

It also depends on how he behaves with alcohol. I have a friend who acts like a total goon after one glass of wine; on the other hand, I know a wildly successful, healthy, and put-together couple that splits a bottle of wine (so a little over two glasses each) every night with no behavioral changes. 

Frankly, a lot of this is the culture of his industry. You could be doing a lot worse for a finance guy. I think the bigger problem here is that he minimizes and to a degree disrespects your concerns. 

Edit: The way you've described his interactions with his family also give me cause for concern. I'm getting the vibe that he feels a certain amount of entitlement to certain treatment because of his high earnings. This is a fundamental lack of respect for others, and in my mind a much bigger problem than an extra evening scotch or two."

"Normally I would be inclined to agree with you, but he does want to get married. If things went his way we would be married by the end of this year. For my own reasons I never wanted to get married before 30, but I've been willing to compromise for him because I really do love him. We will probably be married within the next two years. 

The wedding thing did bug me, but I also kind of understand it. His sister and I get along very well and I consider her a good friend. I wouldn't want to miss out on her wedding. It's not like I was just his plus one at a random wedding. But I do wish he had helped me out a little, especially since paying for my ticket or even just paying for all of the rental car would've helped me out a lot and not even made a dent in his pocket. "
"If you really love your partner then you need to start putting him first and building a new family with him.

First, move out of there and don't visit. Do you need to have a big wedding? Can you afford a small one? Then you can have full control. Don't invite your brother and don't accept any money from your parents. Don't even accept gifts like a wedding dress. Allow your parents to attend if you want - but recognise that they don't have a right to demand anything.

If you plan on having kids then start setting some real and hard boundaries now, because believe me, you don't want kids exposed to your family. Your brother is selfish and cruel and your parents aren't much better."

"So she's good enough to hang out with and fuck but not good enough to date. That's ok I guess, but surely you can see how, even if she did only view you as a FWB, that would hurt? I don't think you did anything wrong but you could have been more tactful. 

Anyway, it's probably best you end your FWB arrangement with this woman. It's not worth the drama in your life if she does have feelings for you and you start dating someone else. "
"&gt; Even in a private conversation, it's one thing to admit you aren't with the best looking person of your dating history, but it's a whole other to come up with cruel nicknames based on the SO's appearance.

Seriously, this is key. Like I have seen pictures of my husband's ex-girlfriends, and met one of them, and I can objectively say that some of them are prettier than me. It's never been discussed in my hearing, but it wouldn't break my heart if he admitted as much. I have other qualities that he values, and obviously he ended up with me instead of any of his exes. What *would* break my heart is if he were to pick specific flaws in my appearance and make up nasty nicknames about me, then joke about it with friends or family. That is cruel and disrespectful. What OP has gained from this experience is a glimpse below the ""dating mask"" her boyfriend wears, an opportunity to see who he really is when there is no pressure to be impressive. As cliche as it is... When someone shows you who they really are, **believe them**."
FUCKYEAH I clean my bathroom pretty thoroughly and I am so into cleaning the fuckin hell outta my toilet omg gotta get all that gross dust outta all the crevices man
"Actually, he's communicating to you that if you pool your resources together, he'll take your money, overdraft your account, and make sure you'll never retire. "
It sounds like he never truly dealt with the grief from losing their parents.  OP that is not on you!
"The wedding planning is generally the first major test of a relationship.

It doesn't sound like yours is going to pass the way you are now.

Have you considered couples' counseling? "
"Sounds like you was /r/raisedbynarcissists . 

There's nothing you can do to change your parent's mindset. I'd recommend you take steps to emotionally remove yourself from her so that her ridiculous favouritism doesn't continue to affect your life in the negative way that it currently does. You don't need her approval, be happy with what you've got and be happy about the approval you have got from the people who matter.

Also, have a good rant on that sub I posted above. It helps. After frequenting, I'm thinking about posting there later today. "
"No. It is because her brain isn't fully developed and she is lacking 30 years of life experience that her ""partner"" has on her. Legal does not mean healthy or moral. It simply means the law will not intervene. Good for your brother. He can be disgusting and groom a young girl while trapping her into a marriage she can't possibly understand the ramifications of. Bad for her. She is losing at life before it starts."
Definitely contact homeowner insurance about this. It's likely covered.
"&gt; Also are you sure that it was really his therapist on the phone? They don't typically discuss the diagnois of their patients with others.

That's what I'm wondering too. This really does not sound like something a halfway decent therapist would recommend if he's in that much danger. "
"Funny, I have been a man for 33 years, and I ALSO am somehow totally fine not having sex when my wife isn't in the mood. I am not a toddler, I can appreciate delayed gratification."
"""I'm sorry you raised such rude and terrible children."""
well she may well be ONE of them
"Is it just me that thinks selling panties isn't fine if you're in a relationship? It's clearly a sexual type of deal, even if it's not cheating. You're doing something that you know other people will get off on, which is fine if you're single, but in a relationship I think that's crossing some boundaries. I dunno, maybe some people are okay with other people masturbating to their SO's underwear?"
"&gt;How do I go about this tactfully?

You probably don't. How would you introduce them if your friend was *not* disabled? Do it that way. 

In my experience, disabled people do not want to be treated differently (unless they ask for assistance at specific times, such as a wheelchair person bound asking you to reach for high things), just mention that you have a friend with a similar interest don't make the disability the subject of the discussion."
"&gt;since we're having a baby together 

Why do you want to be tied to this asshole?  It's not too late for an abortion.

"Realize this: not only did he delete a good chunk of your photos, but he did so secretly and didn't let you know immediately that he did it.

"*Tiffany and her fiancé have been planning their wedding and they are estimating the cost to be around $125,000*

That is completely nuts.

*Tom paid $200,000 for his daughters wedding*

That is also completely insane.

*I want my daughtet to be able to have a wonderful wedding and do not like that Tom would gladly help his daughter, but not his step daughter.*

You sound selfish. Seriously. Get over yourself. Your daughter needs to get over herself as well. Tom owes you nothing and your daughter nothing for her wedding. $125,000 is an insane amount to spend on a wedding."
"Could have been miscarriages. 

**Edit: Look people, a miscarriage is not an easy subject to talk about for some people. Perhaps OP's wife wanted to shoulder the burden by herself? We don't know; he does need to talk to her, but OP shouldn't have jumped to conclusions and needs to be open to listening (without judgement), if he can get his wife to talk about it.**"
Hence why you should not give her any gift of any kind.  Do not set the precedent now that she can trample on you and the worst that happens is you get kind of upset and buy her a gift anyway.  
You did say that she claimed she'd stayed home with you while you were recovering but that you were 'delusional'. I'd say that counts as gaslighting.
"&gt; into that self-pitying wicked-ish panic state girls sometimes do, which she normally never does.

Say what?"

"There is a safe approach, and it's health. You know what is the first cause of death in the western countries? Obesity. All that fat is simply unhealthy, and with time will be very, very dangerous.  

Now back to you. Tell her you just cannot live with a person you love doing that to herself.  
Tell her that, to your point of view, it's like watching someone you love the most stabbing herself and letting herself bleed to death in front of your eyes.  
Tell her that you cannot live with such a person, because the feeling of being powerless while the person you love the most is giving up her life for one more doughnut (or whatever she likes to eat that is destroying her) is simply unbearable.  

Now 2 things may happen: either you'll successfully bring her to reason and **you both** hit the gym to get in a fantastic shape, or she'll tell you to go fuck yourself because she loves food more than her life so you can get the hell out.  
Either way you win."
"You still have the bruises- photograph them. Measure them with a ruler- photograph them and ten call the police and report this. They were there with her and will have it on record. You need to do this for yourself and for your family. Stay away from her (like you are planning to do already). I am sorry that this happened to you. Be well. 
"
"So much this. If the cowardly sister wants to not have her bubble of a life burst around her, she needs to make it right. If not, well, you can't expect to be able to treat people like shit simply because the same two people bumped uglies to create both of you."
In a lot of places in the US the inheritance is separate property anyway.  I am in the process of getting one of these.  My SO has been amazing about it.  My lawyer explained it as - Marriage already has a set of rules about finances.  A prenup is just an adjustment to those rules.
"I probably would have gone this route if I had found out they were planning on paying for my sister's schooling before I'd paid off nearly all my loans, but now that I'm so close to paying them all myself I think I'll just leave it be and finish it myself. Everyone's responses here have really helped clear things up for me. Thanks for your advice! "
"I don't get how everyone is blaming OP and expecting her to pay for her brother's education. This 100% her mother's problem.

When I got engaged, my fiance and I started planning a small wedding that we could afford. My parents told me that they had saved thousands of dollars specifically for our wedding so we changed everything with that budget in mind. If I later found out that was money from a siblings education and I was expected to pay it back I'd be pissed because I wouldn't have had spent that money in the first place. How do you know OP would have had such an expensive wedding without her  mother's lie?"
Documentation would prove injuries but not who caused them.
"That coupled with his wife recently passing, he's likely in a bad place."
"Why do you still think that he genuinely loves you? What's there to talk out? Any decent guy would not be trash talking girls to their friends, calling them ugly and making jokes about their appearance. 


Your boyfriend is with you because no one else would want him. He does not respect you and does not find you attractive. Do you really want to be with someone like that? "
"Because she's probably taken in for granted that he's aware. I mean, it was *his* balls that got cut into. If she didn't cheat- she's probably shell-shocked and reeling, in addition to the pregnancy hormones, and doesn't really think that pointing out the obvious is necessary. If she's been faithful, then in her mind it's freaking obvious that the vasectomy failed- now they have to deal with the more pressing issue growing in her belly.

In a good marriage where both parties have been totally faithful and trustworthy- honestly, why would ""I have to prove I didn't cheat"" even be on her mind right now when the overwhelming ""Oh god we're having another baby""? She knows for certain who the daddy is. She assumes her husband knows and trusts her enough to know as well."
She doesnt need your permission.
"My god, that's insane. I'm so glad you're out. 

Edit: While I was reading your comment this popped into my head and I wondered- do you think your husband really wanted custody of your children? Or was it another attempt at controlling you/fucking with your life? It just occurred to me that some abusive partners might see a divorce /custody battle as their last chance to screw with their partner. Also, if they win custody it gives them something to hold over your head and maybe even lure you back into marriage, at the thought of leaving this monster alone with your children. 

*shudder*

I can't believe people like this truly exist. "
"This is just me turning my gears, but it could have been a major death that most of the SO's family got involved in. It would certainly be awkward to have a vast majority of one family show up and very few of the other due to a death, so they could have just carved everything down to even it out.

Edit: God damn y'all, I'm just theorizing."
"It sounds like he tore his acl or mcl which nowadays is pretty routine and with physical therapy will recover fully. Though, it's a suuuper long process and the injury and recovery from surgery will be painful. 

Husband is being a huge dick. That's his family he's now shunning..."
"Thing is, he's OBVIOUSLY okay with watching her son while she goes to the gym. This is the weirdest ""advice ask"" ever. The simple answer is..... go to the gym. It's more than just a physical thing. He probably thinks you don't care about your appearance anymore (speaking to OP). If OP were to say ""Hun, watch the baby, I need to hit the gym,"" I can 100% guarantee he yells ""FUCK YES I WILL.""


There's hardly advice to give. He's not cheating. He's masturbating to PICS OF HIS WIFE lmao. Just work out."
"I would probably lie and say I had a miscarriage. It's early, it's a stressful time, it's a good reason to not want to talk about it. Definitely don't have a baby you don't want. "
"The eye contact thing is very poignant. I was in an abusive relationship for 8 years, and I had a very hard time looking people in the eye when I spoke to them. I definitely didn't have the self-confidence to interact with people like I can now.

You are so strong. Good on you for getting out safely. Best wishes to you!"
"Yeah, the entire post I was thinking ""is he 12? he sounds 12"""
"I don't know why waiting to see what happens is a logical solution AT ALL. Face your problems head on with all of the information available. Call your landlord and ask exactly what Tasha said was happening. If she's not on the lease, she doesn't get to stay.

It sounds like she's going to take advantage and manipulate where possible. Don't let her."
"It's definitely a grey area, but to be a teacher, a trusted adult or idol, trusted with kids, and to actually target them is not right, and definitely grounds for removal. You don't call a 14 year old girl with social anxiety and possible speech impediment the Dutch blonde bitch that stutters, call her questions stupid, to call the parents pieces of shit because you don't like the kids. It may be done in a stand up routine, but that's just using it as a cover to talk shit after a certain point.  "
"Thanks for the reply. A face-to-face meeting with both couples would be tough because they live 1700 miles away. I wonder if we could facilitate something with her parents, somehow do it remotely or even fly the mother out here. I will admit that while I want a peaceful resolution for all, I am pretty mad at the mother for her behavior towards me. You are very right in that I am the ""nice"" one, I have been really trying not to ""mother"" them in order to not step on her toes but that might be making me a pushover. I know I need to reevaluate my approach to them for when I am actually their step mother.

We have actually discussed moving to where they are, but they are in California, and the CA bar doesn't offer reciprocity so we'd have to both take and pass that bar. We  talked about it with our firm, which has offices in LA, it would just take a lot of planning and coordination and would not happen until after our wedding. Also, we are also both really like living where we are now, we have personal and professional ties in this city, we're right by his family, my family, and the girls' maternal grandparents. Really the only thing in California is the mom and step father. Is my line of thought on this selfish?"
I want to hope that Sarah is not trying to steal your boyfriend.  She is however definitely crossing the line.  You're not jealous--you have a right to be bothered by it.  
"What if there is the back possibility of him snitching resulting in more drastic consequences than three years on jail, like direct consequences or threats to OP's security if he were to snitch?

This is not a black-or-white story, nor one we will ever have the full verison, but that is a good question for OP to make on the first visit."
"Lots of comments about this girl being of consenting age: are there no Romeo and Juliet laws? In my state (Indiana) the legal age of consent is 16, but only if the partner is within 3 years of age. 16 and 19 is cool, 17 and 21 is not. I doubt this relationship is entirely legal..."
I'm sure the nanny would be uncomfortable too if she knew that she is causing a rift in her employers' marriage - and she probably does.
"Was she correct in thinking you would have pressured her into carrying out the pregnancy? If you would have, the two of you might just have incompatible views."
"Because his crimes didn't involve children, it's doubtful he'd have those restrictions."
"Yes. Always be honest with your kids, taking into account their age and maturity about certain things of course. I agree that your 15 y/o is old enough to be talked to like an adult in this situation. It may not pay off immediately, but she will appreciate it eventually."

"What if he called and asked if she/everything was okay?  Check to make sure she's okay and then see if its alright to broach the subject.  Maybe something along the lines of; ""I wanted to make sure everything is okay, I didnt want to cause you any more trouble but... etc."" 

EDIT: What about OP talking to his own mom? Having being married to his dad she would likely know a good route to manage him. "
"She said she regrets it and felt terrible. But yeah I wouldn't call myself a shit person for something I did over 10 years ago when I was a teenager. She didn't murder someone, she cheated. She WAS an asshole. She doesn't have to hate herself forever for that. "
"Reminds me of that one husband from The Joy Luck Club. (He was the boss and his wife was his employee, he insisted they go 50/50 but refused to give her a raise, etc.)"
"&gt;Of course all of her friends hear all about this and think that I'm being completely unfair to her. She blurted this out once in an argument. I'm pretty sure they trash talk me when they hang out because every time she comes back from hanging out with them, she seems annoyed with me.

Someone that constantly trash talks their SO to their friends are either not nice people themselves or are not in a good relationship.

&gt;Of course we have typical couple issues and we'll fight once in a while but I don't think this is anything out of the ordinary.

Dude...2 to 3 days of silence after fights is *not* ordinary for a couple of two years thinking about moving in with each other soon. Yes arguments happen and sometimes you need time to cool off before reapproaching the situation but I'd say two to three days is pretty bad.

TBH, I think you are downplaying some of the issues you and your girlfriend are having. I think your concerns about this new guy ""Steve"" are completely valid because I get the feeling that your girlfriend isn't loving this relationship as much as you think. 

You need to sit down and focus the conversation on what you can do together to strengthen your relationship. **Don't** focus on Steve, he is not the problem. He is a potential solution to your girlfriend's problem of being in an unhappy relationship. Work towards making the relationship better and Steve is removed from the equation.

Hell no. Step 1 should be implantable birth control. 
"You get the girls for weekends and six weeks in the summer. You try to make sure they have a good time and have fun. This is all absolutely fine and what you should be doing. But the problem is that the girls see this as what it's like permanently and don't realise they're basically living in a holiday when they come to visit. If they came to live with you there would be school and homework and chores and all the other boring responsible stuff their mother makes them do when they're at home with her.

Of course they'd want to live with you, you're their fun step mother who takes them on night trips to the beach. They're baiting their mother about it and you're getting caught in the middle. You need to talk to their mother and then talk to the girls seriously about this. "
"Welp. So clearly you got away from a guy with some kind of delusional mindset going on. I'm glad you're free, enjoy your new place and new life! "
"Your family is WRONG. You are not overreacting, your father assaulted you. "
"Post partum depression/anxiety/etc can impact fathers as well.

If your best friend were a new mum and had an outburst like this- you'd probably be worried about how she was coping with the new baby and try to help her get to a doctor and support her. You'd know that this isn't how she usually is. 

Your husband has been under a lot of stress. You nearly lost hte baby. You've been severely ill. You've been sick and unable to leave the house for 4 months. That's a lot of pressure. Now he's acting completely out of character.

Which is more likely:
1. Your husband is suffering from emotional problems related to your health and being a new dad, and he needs more help and support to get back to himself.
2. Your husband is a conniving, evil manipulator who intentionally trapped you in this marriage.

Talk to your family, try to get more support for both of you. See if your husband is willing to try therapy, or at least talk to his GP about what he's dealing with. "
"If she still wanted that life, she wouldn't have chosen to enter a monogamous relationship with you. "

"We have lunch together during work days and see each other outside of that maybe four times a week for an hour-ish at a time. I actually spend more time with my brother than I do with Callie. My wife and I are child-free, and are planning to stay that way, so for us, our hobbies and our friends are our lives, and my wife has an even more robust social life than I do, with friends of all genders. 

On top of everything, and this is what's really sticking in my craw, is the fact that I always check in with her before doing anything with any of my friends, and have come home or cancelled plans in favor of her, which she's also done for me. We've talked at length about Callie and every conversation has ended with my wife reiterating how she was happy. 

My wife and I don't spend any less time together than we did before, and we still go on ""dates"" and I've actually amped up the romantic gestures because I appreciate her and her being as kind as she had been to Callie in her time of hurt and distress made me love my wife even more.  

As for her feeling second to Callie, I just don't understand how she could feel that way, especially when I ask for her approval regarding seeing her, and have respected the times when she vetoed.

I feel blindsided by this."
I suspect his wife is just sick to death of hearing about Callie.
"Not only this, but stop giving your mom 2 grand a mom. She has grown entitled. This is ridicules."
"How are you supposed to resolve these issues? Sit on your hands every time you are around her? go get you hair done every time there's a family get-together? And not wearing enough jewelry: now THERE is a substantive complaint. We all know the under-decorated are the scum of our society. Eyeroll.

I would not meet with her until and unless she's ready to give you a really heartfelt apology. You don't need to work out a compromise when the issue is someone thinks your entire personality and way of being is loathsome. There isn't really a compromise available other than not being around that person any more.

Let your husband deal with her. He's doing great so far."
"This, so much this. The security cameras will at least give you some hard evidence of the bullshit to come. But let me tell you, these folks have little and less to lose by making OP's life a living hell. It will cost OP thousands to pursue what will likely be a fruitless harassment case. Definitely don't give in to these people, but understand that your life there will never be totally peaceful again until OP or the crazies move.
"
"I like how you comment that you think your wife loves you ""more"". That concept makes a lot of people in a relationship feel insulted but I think it's important for healthy couples to feel that way about each other, and use it as a fuel to perpetually try and 'catch up'.

I think my wife loves me more than I do and that makes me want to be the best I can for her, and to give her everything she wants, needs, and deserves from her partner."
"First off, take the mother off Facebook or at the very least block her from seeing your posts. Second, sit down and talk with the boyfriend, and let him know that the next time he makes a comment like that you'll be ending the relationship. "
"Yes..  I would also be a little introspective. It says something about you or your relationship that she didn't feel like she could talk to you or that you'd respect her decision. Please remember the actual having a baby is all on the women.
Guys don't spot out the kid and they most certainly don't have to stick around."
"This reads a lot like a very standard ""sober dude hangs out with drunks all night"". It also depends on how often this happens though. Is this a one off thing or is this a habit of hers? Drunk people are annoying and easily distractable. It sounds like she just kept wandering off because ""ooh shiny!"", not intentionally leaving you behind. They're doubly annoying when you're sober. I doubt she was doing any of this to intentionally to diss you.  I really don't get why you didn't just go home at 11:00pm and let her get a cab. That's what I do when my husband wants to be out late and I need to get up early. 

Talk to her when you're both sober and tell her that you didn't appreciate how that made you feel. Then next time consider going home at 11:00 like you should have."
"&gt; I haven't slept in like two days and I'm still in shock over my dad dying.

OP the state you are currently in is definitely making you over think this, you lost your dad, you broke down. That's normal, it's human. Your co-workers especially Luke understands this. There isn't any reason to be nervous, embarrassed or scared, just take it one day at a time. It's also OK to lean on people in times like this."
"This day is for you and Becks, and the people who support the marriage of you and Becks. I'd avoid inviting anyone who is actively opposed to you two being together.

Calculate how much each person will cost you. Are you willing to spend all that money on this person who doesn't want you two getting married?

What does she add to the ceremony? Certainly not good vibes. At best, she shows up with a smile and keeps her damn mouth shut, but she has so much potential to go rogue that it doesn't seem worth it to me at all. What does your fiance think she brings to the ceremony? Or does he just feel guilty, like he has to invite her?"
Maybe her bikinis have that itchy netting and that's why she is in a bad mood?
"I hate cheating. Loathe it. My advice is usually to admit it and take the consequences.  In your case,  I suggest you keep quiet about it and get the fuck out. Your marriage is pretty much burned.

"Just checked, and OP, you've been with this guy since you were 17. You have no idea what a real, normal, healthy relationship is like. You honestly owe it to yourself to try one and get out of this one."
"I have friends who think it's ethically wrong to bargain in non-Western countries. As someone who is from an Asian culture where bargaining is the norm, and has travelled throughout much of Asia, I see it as part of the experience and it can even be fun! 😊 I actually think there's a fair amount of hubris involved when you know bargaining is the cultural norm and don't engage in it at all. In countries where it's expected, particularly in touristy areas, prices are purposely inflated so that there is wiggle room for bargaining. So when you don't bargain, people don't think, ""wow, you're so generous"", they either think, ""wow, you must be a bit thick to pay that much"" or ""why aren't you bargaining, am I a charity case to you?!""

Case in point: in Cambodia, we were bargaining with a tuk-tuk driver to take us to the Vietnamese embassy. He wanted 4x what we knew to be the going price. I laughed and said ""No, it's $x! I've done this trip before!"" He said, ""I took an Australian family there for $4x this morning!"" I replied, ""well you ripped them off good then, didn't you?!"" Him and his friend laughed and agreed with us, and he dropped us off for $x. Good-natured banter, everyone was happy 😊

I think what you did was fine. if after talking about it some more (and maybe even showing him this thread?) he still expects you to change to his mindset, this suggests potential for major issues down the line re finances. 8 months is not very long at all, and this is a big-ish deal.

Edited to add my actual point/advice!"
"Spot on. Think long &amp; hard here, OP. Your fiance has revealed a very unsavory truth about himself through this situation.

The issue here isn't ""How do we get Nick to come to the wedding?"" but rather, ""How can my fiance stop using his insecurity as an excuse to bully others?""

Your fiance's being a dick. Of course his brother wants nothing to do with him."
"Ohhh man. I'm of the opinion that the ex never needs to know about an abortion--but he's got a baby out there that he's never going to be able to meet? Yeah, you tell him."
Imagine what will happen if some God forbid acts happen to you. Will he leave? What if you get really sick? My neighbor tried to divorce his wife when she was in the hospital. She was devastated. You know what. He used the same excuse about how he couldn't handle stress. Total BS.
"Yeah, hurting a pet is 100% insta-breakup material."
"My wife originally told me ""no"" when I proposed, so I can relate. Although you have been dating a long time, marriage may not have felt ""real"" to her until you officially presented her with the choice. Remember that you had all the time in the world to mentally prepare for this, plan the proposal, get hyped for it, etc. and she had a single moment to decide yes or no. Given how she kept pushing off this commitment for years, I assume change is not something that comes easy to her so she may need the same time you took to REALLY adjust to the idea of marriage.

That being said, disappearing for weeks with little to no communication is not the way that a healthy couple resolves conflicts. If the relationship continues, you really should go to counseling to work on your communication with one another.

I hope you emerge from this a stronger couple."

"What the literal fuck.

No.

""She's my younger sister. You don't have to believe me, but that doesn't change who parents are.""


And then never talk to them about it again. Seriously. "
"""Honey, my parents want a key to our apartment. I think we should give them one just to keep the peace.""

""Honey, my parents want to be added to our joint checking account.""

Seriously, don't let your friends belittle her and take jabs at her.  Don't look down and awkwardly laugh and say ""Yea, yea..."" 

Defend her!  Tell them good things about her, and call them on their asshattery when they're being mean for no reason.  And don't give a shit about what other people think.

"&gt; Change your diet

Yes, and stop blaming your wife for what she feeds you. If what she cooks doesn't work out well for your body, make the effort to cook your own food, go grocery shopping with her, or plan out some meals. She's pregnant and it's not going to kill you to participate a little more in housework type stuff."
"omg you are so fucking amazing. this is the best thing ive ever read on this sub reddit. 


just saw Cleveland. I am 30M from the east side, I do have a GF but I have a lot of single friends! PM me if you ever go out downtown or DTW, be glad to get a beer with ya!"
Just fucking do it. Your parents are obviously nuts.
"I'm assuming you've changed the names, but if the tattoo does say 'Zane' it's actually a pretty easy fix to make it say 'Zany', which might indeed reflect her personality."
Oookaaay.     Now we're getting into some dangerous territory here. He needs to agree to counseling or you need to leave. 
Your sister is displaying signs of depression. You've written about trying to talk to her but have you gotten her professional help?
I think the worst part is that he obviously has been setting it up to happen at some point.  You don't just go get sex with a co-worker unless the flirting and boundary-crossing has been there for a while.
"Why exactly does this make you so uncomfortable?  Do you think the guy is crazy/delusional or is he just attached to you and wants to feel like an important part of your life?  

He doesn't have any children of his own. Maybe he thinks of you as his only chance to feel like a father?  Is there any harm in that?  Some people would think it's kind of sweet.

But if it really makes you uncomfortable, tell him, but do it gently.  Would you be okay if he called you his step-son?  "
"For myself to feel that way, too."
"Perhaps she should go to school for marine biology, since I doubt any ethical purveyor of aquarium creatures--or local zoning boards--would let her randomly purchase sharks.

It would also teach her about everything required to maintain these creatures and possibly talk her out of it.

Ideally, maybe suggest she could get a job at the aquarium or volunteer there?"
"I took the dog because I was scared he would hurt him, he's done it before and he was completely insane last night. I can't believe I slept with my friend though. I can't even use being drunk as an excuse because I didn't have even one drink last night. Hooooly shit what a disaster."
"My understanding is that the first legal gay marriages took place in England in 2014. So you were already together, engaged, and had a kid who was at least 2 years old when he married someone else without telling you? Not to mention the other legal and financial complications he exposed both you and your son too.

Something is really off here and I'm not sure you're getting the full story. Either your fiance is an absolute moron, or he didn't want to marry you, or he left something else out. What you now know for certain is that your supposed partner is capable of lying to you in ways that significantly effect your relationship, you and your child. Take some space, consult a lawyer to figure out the implications (regardless of whether you want to stay with him you need to figure this piece out), don't tell your son anything until you know for sure.  Go to couples counseling (either you'll figure out how to stay together given this huge betrayal or you'll figure out how to split up and co-parent effectively). 

Also I hate to do the age thing, but he was 24 and you were 16 when you got together?  Are there any other places where he lies to you, acts in controlling ways, doesn't tell you important things, or otherwise has power over you in this relationship?   OR are there other times that he has done something this stupid and immature?  Is this a complete surprise or a larger manifestation of other problems in your relationship?

EDIT: Also it seems like he is implying he did it for immigration reasons (so he involved you in fraud without your consent).  The thing is I have a hard time believing that when immigration investigated the marriage for the visa purposes they didn't check into the fact that one half of the marriage had a kid and was in a relationship with someone else. I'll admit, I don't know what that process looks like in your part of the world but I would definitely look into that too.  It's usually not like you just get married in a courthouse and boom citizenship is granted, normally you still have to apply for citizenship and meet other criteria."
"He was the one who came to me about us both getting surgery to become permanently sterile. He was the one who always spoke about fears on me keeping a child if I ever became pregnant. I honestly don't see him as the type to hide this for over 3 years? Why would you get with someone who adamantly doesn't want children, the thrill? The fun? The idea of a challenge? I don't get it."
"I would seriously consider going to the police but I can understand why your girlfriend doesn't want to and I would not force her to do so, but this man is a monster and she should do what it take to ensure he does not continue to threaten her like this, it is horrid manipulation and blackmail. 

I would also like to add that I am not surprised she didn't tell you about it and that she was so upset that you found out. It sounds like you are reacting in a very mature way, but I think it is reasonable that she would be worried you would not and she still might be concerned. Give her time and prove through actions, by staying supportive of her, that you really mean it doesn't affect how you feel about her. But recognize she has been through a trauma of this coming out and worried it might go further."
"Asking people like OP's BF this question is pointless. Of course they are going to say it wouldn't bother them, because they know it's not going to happen (cause people like OP are too respectful to do that to them)."
"Sounds a bit suspicious.  I'd bring it up again when you are face to face and see if she looks guilty. Maybe you are hearing things, but maybe not."
"Sorry, wife. I'm just not used to the term yet. Long day. English is my second language, and calling her my girlfriend for so long I just forget to mention sometimes. "
"Funny, I've been married to a man for years, and when I'm not up for getting down, he's perfectly happy to cuddle and watch a movie instead. "
That doesn't seem like something you should send in an RSVP. Email or letter perhaps.
"&gt;He sees my views of money as ethically wrong

Wtf is ethically wrong about haggling? The way I see it, it's ethically wrong to be knowingly taken advantage of. 

Maybe it's all a load of bullshit, and he's just angry you're better at him at this part of life?

Has this person ever negotiated a raise or something? It's the same logic."
This is great advice! I would also block his mom on all social media. She's being ridiculous and none of your posts sound inappropriate but she'll find a reason to nitpick anything. 
"Exactly. If OP were posting about her boyfriend or her husband being this jealous and possessive, we'd all most likely tell her to leave because he sounds controlling and abusive. 

And as her FWB, he has no reason at all to demand this much of her time, let alone try to make her allow him to track her location through her phone."
"You are not as mature as you think if your response to your father expressing genuine concern is to get angry and storm off. It's delusional enough for *anyone* to believe that their current relationship will last forever. It's way beyond that to expect everyone else to believe that, or walk on eggshells pretending they do."
"Don't be too gradual.

No more lunches and texting. Conversation can be friendly, but keep it to work hours. It isn't hard."
"I would say that he's already shot the ""we communicate well when we disagree"" thing dead.  His first reaction to the news that his sister won't be MoH is to use the silent treatment on his fiance.

He doesn't communicate at all, and the fact that OP considers their ability to communicate well when they disagree makes me worried that she's decided that this kind of nonsense = ""communicating well"""
"I'm sorry, but no. It's just mean. My husband never tells me I'm fat, even though my thighs and butt jiggle and I have stretch marks across my abdomen and thighs. He hates hearing me call myself fat and tells me I'm beautiful. I hope you find someone who does the same for you, because I don't think your current guy will after 7 years.

Also, I wonder what makes him think he's such a catch that he can put you down like that."
The fact that she's kinda bragging about this guys wealth to her family before they've even committed to anything seems a little...crass?
"You went on a date with a guy who was really nice, smart, and funny.  You had drinks and went back to his hotel room.

There's nothing wrong with this.  People do this every day. Did he pay you?  Sure.  That doesn't make you any less of a person.  It doesn't change who you are.  You are still you.  

Don't feel shame.  Don't feel guilt.

If you don't want to do it again, then don't.  That's fine.  If you do want to do it again that's fine as well.

You're doing the best you can.  You're doing great.  Be proud of you, be proud of everything you're accomplishing.  You're a good person, don't let this small thing consume you."
"I'm sorry, not even Ross would have spun a ""break up"" out of that argument. Hell at least in his case, Rachel did say they should take a break. You did nothing of the sort.

The baby might have been a little bit less of an accident as well.
"I have a fairly common first name, and my middle name is Marie. When I was a teenager it upset me greatly, and when I turned 18 I stopped caring and now I like my name perfectly fine. 

I think Aurora is a beautiful name. I also think most people probably won't associate it with the Disney Princess-most people just call her Sleeping Beauty. And even if they do, who cares? If you gave your daughter a different name, and your husband met someone crappy who shares the same name, would he demand to change it? He needs to get over it. It's a beautiful name, she's his beautiful daughter, he should be a happy man."
"So will this be an occasion where sober you sees the consequences of drunk flirty you and decides to make the change that you need to dial it back or is this like water off a ducks back? Because while his friend made it weird, you did start it. He was completely in the wrong, but do you think it would have gone the same way had you not grabbed him?"
"I've been trying for the past few weeks to get him to open up about anything, and he's insistent that nothing is wrong, that he just wants some changes. It was foolish of me, but I guess I was hoping that this was temporary or we'd be able to talk through it at some point.. but doesn't look like it's going to happen. 

But you're right, he is being absolutely selfish. "
"But change your locks first, OP!!"
"Married life is wonderful when you have a trusting, respectful, loving relationship - but from the sounds of it that's not what you have. I don't think your husband is the right person for you."
Yep. I felt sick reading her post.

"You'll find this is the case around the world.

Chinese look down on Southeast Asians for being dark.
Northern Indians look down on Southern Indians for being dark.

"I think something along these lines should be added...

""Sometimes there are things you don't get to know and you have to accept that the people involved *do* know what's best for themselves, have made the right decision, and you will never get a full explanation. We accept that you will wonder about this, but we will not talk about it again. Allowing your curiosity to overcome your good sense in this matter will be destructive.""

Sometimes people need to be reminded that they don't get to know something just because they want to know it. That urge, especially for a parent, can be irrational at times. Having to remind someone isn't necessarily a bad thing.

The side effect of going through this effort of explaining why you won't explain the situation to her is that, if she has any brains, she's going to jump to a new conclusion of cuckholding almost immediately. So while you're not going to tell her exactly what's happening, don't be surprised if she uses her brain and figures it out anyway. Just respond with a 'We're not talking about this' line."
The question goes both ways - what do you do to make her happy? You say you work 80 hour weeks. That's pretty much no time leftover to spend with your family. You pouring all your energy into work and her pouring all her energy into taking care of kids = your current situation. She probably feels just as neglected as you do. 
"I had both a parent and then a partner (ex) reveal to me that their life's stories were actually deceptions, and their 'personalities' merely well crafted personas to fit the fiction.

When the deception has been so detailed, so enduring, &amp; so foundational to the relationship - any actual subsequent *communication* may be impossible.

If everything has been deception to this point, can there be any level of trust in the veracity of any word or deed?"
"I don't think why he did it is relevant, it's disgusting. Hopefully the boyfriend will learn a lesson when she drops him like a bad habit."
"There's this scene in The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt where the Mole Women are discussing how each of them was kidnapped by the Reverend. After they relate their stories, Matt Lauer comments:

&gt; I’m always amazed by what women will do because they’re afraid of being rude…

So on point here. One, who gives a shit about being rude? You paid for your own room. Two, you're not being rude by protecting yourself. Get the fuck out and read the Air BnB owner the riot act, contact corporate, and leave one hell of a review. Get out and light him up, girl. "
This! Thank you! He's getting way too much shit for this imo. 
"If Dick is his friend, he has very poor choice in friends."
"Definitely this. Obviously it must be hard for him to admit that he is transgender, but no matter what way you look at it he should have said so in the beginning. If you didn't know already how would you have felt if he told you this far along? I'd be pretty upset. Him trying to be deceptive is pretty shady. "
"Yeah, she used to be bullied mostly by other girls according to my uncle. It wasn't once or twice that my grandmother was called to school because my mother was having problems with other girls"
Your girlfriend is pregnant and your spending a bunch of time hanging out with and texting some chick that you just met. Yea I'd be pissed too. Why is your friendship with this person that you JUST MET more important than your girlfriend's feelings and security?
This is NOT stupid. This is your marriage. This is your wife's feelings.

"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that a breakup is long overdue.

He's cheated twice. More suspect behaviour. Why do you keep forgiving? 

It's hardly your fault but it comes across as sad that you feel the need to check his phone. That's not normal, although completely unsurprising given the situation. 

Once a cheater, always a cheater. It's an 'entitled mentality', rather than a transient occurrence in my opinion/experience."
This can only end well.
Umm... the title and the entire thread. Are you lost or something? 
"&gt;If I come home and see him with his ass on my couch playing COD, I will lose my damn mind

And rightly so. Which is what will happen.


Tell him that he can't move in, but you're thrilled he wants to live with his baby &amp; baby mom, and point him towards the local unemployment center/fatherhood classes (lots of nonprofits offer these)


&gt;We considered maybe letting him live with us for a limited time

No, this isn't going to end well."
"So, you are working at least 40 hours a week outside of the home, and you're a first year law student ... but he expects you to prioritize cleaning over all of your other responsibilities? That's a massive problem.

Let's not even talk about the fact that this dude is just shy of 40 and throwing temper tantrums complete with hissy fits and demanding a ""return on investment"". There's no part of this that is not complete and utter madness.

What are you getting out of this relationship, and why do you choose to stay in it?"
"On top of this advice, I would explain to her one more time that this is the final discussion, and throw in something like, ""My deposits/payments for this vacation are non-refundable, so this not just logistically impossible, but financially as well."" And refuse to engage her anymore.  It's a lie, but sometimes if you make it seem like it's completely out of your hands, people will back off.  She'll probably still be a bitch about it, but it might at least get her to stop asking."
I admit that I downvoted this out of spite.
"He SAVED the photos and keeps looking at them?  OP, ask him what he gets out of looking at the pictures over and over.  Because that is weird behavior.  If I don't like something or an event happened that I was upset about, I would not look at the visual evidence over and over and over."
They are emotionally together. 
Walking away from a guy who doesn't respect you is probably exactly what your dad would want you to do.  Staying behind would be s disappointment.
"Pregnancy is never a guarantee, regardless of age."
"If Matt has been running a porn scam he has probably passed many things onto his wife - assuming he isnt using protection.

"&gt; have them grind on his lap

I agree with you. Along a continuum of looking, touching, and proximity, OP has permitted her husband much more leeway than he is permitting her. In this instance, he is upset because she merely looked! His location-based criteria is so obviously a bogus cover for a clear double-standard. Based on his criteria, sex in a sex club wouldn't be cheating but having coffee at home would be (okay I exaggerate but you see my point)."
"&gt; someone who's nice to you but cruel to others is NOT A NICE PERSON. 

They're nice to you because they want something from you. Once they figure they can get that something without being nice, or stop getting it, they'll turn on you. "
It can't. Get out. He's got it in his head that you're just a sex machine to give it to him whenever he barks the command.
"The cases thay I have seen where r/relationship suggest a woman to abort without telling the father is when: 1- It was a one night stand or 2- They ended the relationship before knowing that she was pregnant.

If the pregancy comes during the duration of the relationshio the father SHOULD know. I only push to not telling when the relationship between the mother and the father is nonexistence or toxic.

If you don't trust your partner to support you and to agree in a solution, it shows a deep lack of trust. Is better if they broke up."
"Start calling them every chance you get. It doesn't matter if it's noon on Thursday. If you can hear him inside your house with the windows closed, he needs to be reported. When he gets pissed and starts playing louder, call them again. Eventually he'll either do something to mitigate the noise, he'll get into too much trouble and the actual police will come out for disturbing the peace, or he'll move. You're basically training a very large toddler. "
"Def get the sperm count.. my older brother was told this, too, and his wife is pregnant with #3 in 3 years.."
"Honestly, she probably finds your cluelessness cute.

Look for the post that basically outlines cleaning up the apartment and making sure it is woman friendly, invite her over and as things progress and go well you should just straight up ask her ""Hey, um, you look really beautiful tonight and I want to know if it's ok if I kiss you?"" Then kiss and go from there, as it gets late, like before normal bedtime though, invite her to stay over, let her know you have an extra tooth brush and she can wear one of your shirts if she wants."
I would think you would want to put away your undoubtably expensive glass pieces when children come over. Even the most well supervised kids occasionally break things. 
I agree.  I don't think i will tell her though.  In the future i will just try to talk her into going elsewhere.
"The only thing keeping you there is the fact that you are overwhelmed with having to figure things out.

Do one thing at a time.  Get out of the lease.  Then you can figure out the details one thing at a time. 

You can't stay with him.  What he did is completely unforgivable. You can't allow your son to be around this kind of nonsense."
What kind of weird assholes do you drink with?
"Blasphemy! I've already told my boyfriend if we get married I'm worth at least 500k cattle. My parents are expecting that! What will we do now?!?! 😋

FWIW, we aren't seriously talking marriage, too soon, and he's not officially divorced yet. But if we do marry I want moissanite and not a diamond. And I would be horrified if he spent 3 months of his salary (18k total) or even 3 months of my salary (15k total) on a ring. What a waste. I would rather go on multiple trips or vacations. Save for a house. Prepare for retirement. Or even spend that on his kids (who are not my kids) for a college fund. All better uses IMO.

I get wanting a ring you like. Duh. You're gonna wear it forever. But that amount of money is just insane. Especially on the falsely-inflated highly unethical diamond market."
"You don't have to have feelings for someone to grieve their loss. Please stop making this about you. I have a feeling that's what happened: you wouldn't stop talking about her and her death and his feelings about you and if he really loves you and what about her and did he still love her etc, to the point where he just couldn't get any space to grieve. That's why he wants you to stay away. It's not about you. "
"&gt; Am I being immature?

Yes

&gt; How should I handle this?

Realize that he's chosen to only be with you. Realize it before you push him away."
I second all of this. I had to scroll back up to see the ages - this dude is in his *mid-thirties?!* Incredibly immature.
Shout out to her brother for giving you that pep talk
"The only one making a big deal out of it is him, and he's making a HUGE deal out of it. I remember boys acting squeamish about periods and tampies. 

When I was in highschool. 

It's one thing to be a little freaked out about it, but to outright lie about shit to avoid dealing with anything related to feminine hygiene--be it used or unused--is the behavior of a little boy, not a grown ass adult. 

If I were you, I WOULD lose my cool. He frigin YELLED at you for putting garbage in the *gasp* garbage? I suggest you take off the kid gloves, sit his ass down, and tell him it's high time he grows up. If he's got such a problem with shark week, maybe he should vacate the waters. "
"So, obviously there is no legal recourse here since she's above the age of consent. I see two options for you:

1. You and/or your family talk to your brother about this. She may be in a rebellious teen phase, but he's not, and his behavior is much creepier here. Maybe it will help, maybe it won't, but doing nothing is guaranteed not to change the situation. You know your brother and we don't, so no one here can say if it's going to work...but since we've established the legal system won't help, social pressure seems like the only direct option. 

2. Provide her with a safe space. She currently doesn't realize that the relationship between herself and your brother is off, but she may someday realize it. There's also the possibility that he's going to escalate to more bizarre behaviors. Let her know that you and your family support her as a person, not just as your brother's wife. She may someday need to get out and it may not be easy - plan for that situation, ensure that she feels safe with you and trusts you so that she can come to you for help if it ever comes to that.  "

My sister had to educate them on the fact that being Indian and BLACK that both of our parents were BOTH called the N word my father a SAND N and that they were seriously mistaken if they didn't understand that not only black people in America were called N words. 



The fact that black people really think they are the only PoC and or people who should be allowed to use the N word is really the most ignorant thing I've ever heard of. 



The word should really just fade out of existence imo but if you choose to use it then you can't become offended when someone else does - ESPECIALLY after you tell them that it's acceptable and it's meant in a FRIENDLY way.

"**Small update:** Hello again everyone, thank you so much for all of your responses. I never would have thought that I would receive so much good advice from all of you over such a weird issue. So... Things are a little better now (I guess, not really), as I left a voicemail saying that there could be some way for us to make a compromise, something that would not be harming these beings, a proper way to care for them. It seems that now she is suddenly open to the idea of doing this, after 2 whole days of not speaking to me. Reddit, you will love her reasoning for this.


She has legitimately told me that she wanted to ""test"" how far I would go for ""us"". I'm very curious why she would propose such a fantastical and cruel idea to see if I would simply do it. I admit, for a good portion of our marriage, I have been a classic ""push over"", bending to her will on things I would rather not do if it was truly up to me. I feel like somewhere along the way my opinions and reasoning has lost value in her eyes, and has lost value in my own eyes. This is just something that I could not allow, and I think it royally pissed her off simply because I would not do it.


Basically, she would have let this happen if I would have been willing to, but she made it ""sound more crazy"" to see how far I would take it to help her ""live her dream"". I think I have lost myself Reddit, this feels even worse than her not speaking to me for 2 days over this whole bizarre ordeal. 


A lot of you have said that she is nuts, i'm starting to believe it after this shit. I'm not quite sure I should be with someone that is willing to test me over something that would cause great harm to other living things just to see if I would go through with it. I feel like I have been manipulated this whole time, like it's some sham marriage or something, so she could live a lavish dream.


I don't really know what to do at this point... We sure as hell aren't going to build an aquarium. I am leaning towards telling her to go get counselling, or us getting counselling together, or just trying to settle this in a civil manner because I do not feel like being ""tested"" again. I feel that it would surely happen again...I actually have no doubt in my mind knowing how manipulative people continue this behavior.


Thanks you again everyone, from the bottom of my heart. Maybe I will post an update if you want in a few days.



**Small Update #2:** My wife and I have talked heavily about it since I posted this update and she has decided to go to counselling. Lately she says that she has been having growing obsessions for things, almost this type of level, but has been bottling it up inside. She took me not agreeing with this as a personal attack against her. She has also not really felt like herself lately, and I have taken notice of that. Apparently she has been trying to self-diagnose by reading online, which I have heard is not a good way to go about mental health. Her job is extremely stressful and taxing and this seems to have been some type of outlet.

No agreement has been reached on an alternative to the ""aquarium"". I'm starting to doubt she even wanted this whole thing to go through to begin with, its worrisome.  I am not really sure if my wife is ""in her right mind"" at the moment, because this is such extreme behavior and she has never acted like this... I do love her greatly though, and will support her 100% through counselling. I do feel bad about all of this in a way, like I should have noticed something was going on, but I truly did not see this coming. We both live extremely busy lives, which is not an excuse, but I feel is a contributing factor to my possible negligence.

"Give him some time. You can apologize about the ""pass"" comment when you see each other (I am assuming that you already have in your texts and voice messages).  When you do talk, don't mention the soulpatch or his height.  He is clearly insecure about his looks so don't add to it. Stick with his college and your sexual interactions being the 2 and 2 you put together."
"He has the problem here. He hated her and now wants... whatever she had going for her back. So much that he's lied to himself about you, trying to make you seem like a bad choice, to help justify him going back to her.

I suggest breaking up obviously, and when he asks what happened you tell him you heard his phone call, but dont worry you wont be killing yourself over him. A few weeks later youll hear how he's back with her and miserable again.

In all of this you arent to blame. He isnt over her, but wont admit it, and hes making you a villain so he feels better when he goes crawling back to her."
"Yeah its a sort of shitty thing to do, but damn did his sister put you in a shithead spot. "
Use your words. Tell him he should sleep in his own bed. 
"There seems to be confusion here, so clarification: me staying in the hotel room with my boyfriend and the other groomsman 1. is what other SOs are doing and 2. wouldn't cost them any extra money. "
I'm curious as to why you haven't broken up with him. 
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure this isn't what most hetero guys do. In fact I'm pretty sure they don't watch porn together at all.

OP, it sounds like you might be bi or bicurious. There's nothing wrong with that. Usually completely straight people don't do or want to do sexual things with the same gender, though.

It's pretty normal for your parents to think you're gay after seeing that."
"Anecdotal data point: I have a 6yo daughter and know Sleeping Beauty's name is Aurora. Being a wannabe feminist dad, I made a point to learn the various princess names and Sleeping Beauty's name was the hardest to learn because it's not really associated in popular culture. To that point: When I read OP's post and I got to the name, I was like ""Aurora, I don't know any Auroras, that's a pretty good name, I'd be cool with that."" And I didn't even think of Sleeping Beauty until OP mentioned it later in the post. And at that point I just rolled by eyes."
Call the cops. Scare the living shit out of the little fucker. That goes beyond little kid messing with stuff into straight up adult style thievery and should be treated as such
I read this is the Dragon Ball Z announcer's voice.
"I don't think the part of reconnecting with an ex is the biggest problem here. 

She has...a special hate for abusers. I mean, nobody likes them, but like ""Ultimatums are tools of abusers"". ""Being uncomfortable with something and talking about that with my partner is a sign of future abuse"". I don't know what happened to OP before, but that's clearly not...right. he felt uncomfortable about it, and she blew up in his face how she is free to do whatever she wants. Well, yeah, but then the relationship is over, obviously. Even if he didn't end it that blow would have stuck with him. It showed him how his gf sees him- a possible abuser. That's not what I'd call a boyfriend. 

She seems like she's actively watching out for someone to abuse her, and thus expecting everyone to do it at any moment. She also seems to misunderstand abuse and general...Well, relationship stuff.

Ultimatums are there to set boundaries after someone doesn't want to comply. You give them time to think about it, but at the same time pressure them so they won't just let it go and think nothing's gonna change. 

Telling your partner that you feel uncomfortable with something and would like them not to do it is not controlling. It's setting boundaries, which is very healthy for everyone involved. There is a difference between settings boundaries and abuse and while it can be difficult to tell these two apart sometimes, its clearly the former in this case. The OP not respecting her bfs boundaries and even actively assaulting him for doing something perfectly fine showed him how nuts she is. I'm with him."
"&gt; I agree...but I'm getting tired of counselors and counseling.

Then get a divorce.  

You'd be better off with a couples THERAPIST rather than a counsellor.  Counsellors are glorified fluffers."
"I think this is a bit harsh. You're blaming OP when she didn't know what happened. In America, most of my friends had their family members pay for a wedding and it was sort of thought that if they had the financial means and didn't help, then your parents didn't give their blessing or didn't care as much. It is normal and not unreasonable/highly irresponsible for parents to assist in their children's wedding.

HOW was OP supposed to know her mother couldn't afford it? You claim their family seems to have a history for this thing but if looking at the history, you also need to acknowledge the fact that her mother (I'm assuming a single woman since dad isn't mentioned at all) financed her eldest two daughter's college in full and had enough savings for her son to attend years before he turned 18 as well. This does not sound like a poor, irresponsible, impulsive woman. Blaming OP (calling her financial decisions irresponsible) for trusting her mother's story and accepting the generous gift from her mother is strange in my opinion. If someone offers you a gift, will you decline just because without the gift you could not afford it as well?

And yes while the mother ""blew"" the savings, they technically were her savings, went to her children, and I would argue that it wasn't for a ""short term party."" Yes, it is morally unfair and unjust if the son would be denied the same opportunity over favoritism, but again none of these kids are entitled to mom's money. Marriage is for life (or at least people enter into it generally assuming it will be) and weddings are symbolic to celebrate the beginning of the marriage. It's not like it was just a random, asinine thing.

 We also do not know the mother's true plan, if she plans on replacing the money. So far we just have secondhand hearsay delivered through a panicked sister to an even more stressed and panicked OP. I could easily see the mom meaning that she planned on replacing the money (why she lied to prevent OPs guilt and because since she planned on replacing it she thought nobody would find out) and saying any other left over could be paid for by ""loans."" Doesn't say whether it's her loans or brother's loans. Just ""loans."" So the whole situation here is ambiguous at best and assuming mom is just unfair, inconsiderate and callous to the brother just doesn't sit right with me given that she seems very generous to her kids.

I truly think this wedding isn't indicative of OP's spending and I do not think it is a crime to desire things above your means. Everyone has dreams/goals/wants above their means, it's human nature. I cannot blame OP for being offered a generous gift that she normally could not afford and accepting it because it basically funded one of her life goals and dreams. 

Lastly, with grandpa, he had a history of debt and losing his house. With mom, she has a history of saving copious amounts of money and affording to give her and her children luxurious lifestyles. With OP, she accepted a gift for a dream wedding and nothing else is known/said about the rest of her financial life. I truly do not think you can compare these and easily claim they're habitually committing fiscal irresponsibility that runs in the family. 
"
That's fucking awesome. You're really cool. Good luck!
"I'll try and see what happens, I really just don't want to cause any trouble so I keep doing stuff and keeping things in order.

&gt;I'm really, truly not sure why you feel so guilty about Lauren facing consequences for her actions (or lack thereof), OP. Looking out for family is a two-way street.

She tells me that I owe her for bring her in and I guess my parents just kind of taught me to just get stuff done. My sister does face consequences for not doing the chores, Frank is livid wit her pretty much constantly but I don't think he wants to look at a dirty kitchen or living room so I just do it for him really.

I feel like I'm trying to keep his house clean and maybe him and my sister can focus on working out their issues?

I probably sound so ridiculous but I dunno.

I guess I'm just wired to do this stuff, both of my parents were sickly and during their times of illness I did pretty much do everything around the house. 

I guess that's why it doesn't seem much different to me, I've been doing this type of stuff since I was 11 or 12?

Frank and my sister are both my legal guardians although I don't know enough about it to know if he needs full custody or something to take me in legally?"
"Still though. OP's not her personal accountant. I don't blame the husband for running, the house is gonna fall apart the second OP moves out. "
"&gt; And she clearly doesn't understand feminism if she demands that all women ""cover up!"".

Fucking this. She isnt a feminist, she is a fucking idiot. "
He understands that. But it is perfectly reasonable that he is upset because she wouldn't involve him as an equal partner after 4 years together.
"You met a female equivalent of a ""nice guy"". She thought that, because of your past promiscuity, and that she had convinced everyone you two would be a great couple, that she was owed a relationship. 

Go no contact with anyone who sides with her. And block them from social media so they can't feed the drama lama. Lock that shit down so they can't sneak a peak and fill in your ""nice guy"" stalker. "
"The OP himself said in response to my comment that I was basically right. If he wanted to protest and tell us that it wasn't that bad, he could have. But instead he validated it. 

This certainly isn't exactly what they said, and this whole story could be fake, but according to OP, they were pretty explicit. "
It's not selfish of you. But it does probably mean this relationship has run its course.
He became shitty because people didn't call him out. Call him the fuck out
"Ok, something that not a few people are catching onto is the fact that you have been going out with this guy for 14 months. 14 MONTHS. Think about what that means. Over a year into your relationship and he is still so salty about your ex that he feels the need to delete your photos of him. He hasn't trusted you the whole time you've been together if he's going to pull this stunt at 14 months in. You deserve so much better. If he really believed your relationship was in the 'here and now' he wouldn't be so obsessed with your past. "
Am childfree &amp; it sounds from here that he absolutely wants kids.
"if you don't get invited to the wedding, and especially if you get invited and then uninvited, you don't have to give a gift (especially not a $5k gift, maybe a 10 dollar gift card to applebys...)

"
"You are a textbook cliche.

Sally has no boundaries and probably sees you as a meal ticket- her taking time off work (who's paying her bills) when you're a much older doctor is just weird. 

Her kissing you, knowing you are engaged- can you trust her not to cheat on you too? She clearly has no compunction going after men who are not available. 

It's nice to be showered with affection whilst you are sick- it's going to be come pretty clingy afterwards."
[deleted]
"You're not trying to understand her problem though. You are pushing her to see that you are right and have all the answers and she is wrong. And that doesn't matter at all. She's lonely at a party where it's all about you and your family and she doesn't feel like she fits. Have you ever been to a party that you just don't seem to meld well with everyone and no matter what happens you keep winding up on the outside? That sucks. 

And it is your responsibility to be that buffer because you are her link. You are supposed to be her little light that no matter what goes down, you will always hang out with her. She wanted to default to you and you weren't there. And then when she finally got you, you pressed her to talk to you when she wasn't ready. She even asked to take a walk so she could get ready and you argued that. Try to see it from her perspective."
"10/10 would have done the same. Probably angrier and faster. 

Good choice. "
"She later made a comment where she said she has to ""watch herself"" because of his temper. She's probably learned that standing up for herself leads to more verbal abuse - or in this case, physical abuse."
"To be fair, I don't blame him for not wanting a big dog in the bed while sleeping (space wise: 2 people, plus big dog... Maybe in a California King, but I get that change, but not all the other stuff). My SO and I sleep with our dog in the bed but he's a lil guy. We wouldn't have room for a Labrador or anything. 

You're right about this one. I just don't want OP overreacting to the next guy if he asks for some bed space. That's normal. This guy has gone far beyond that though."
"Well, if you weren't broken up before, you certainly are now."
"This seems like BS.  I got tested at my place in minutes.  You give them the sample, they put it under a microscope, and you have sperm or it's just the other fluid.  They don't need to look for motility or anything, it's just a binary sperm are there, check yes or no."
"I'm sorry. Really though, just cut them out of your life. You don't need shitty people like this surrounding you. "
"Also make sure to use incognito/inprivate/etc browsing when you're looking up resources for getting out, and delete your internet history regarding this thread. Not all of your internet history, just the stuff that will flag up suspicion. He sounds dangerous and right now he thinks you're locked in. "
"&gt;abusive partners might see a divorce /custody battle as their last chance to screw with their partner.

This is so common you wouldn't believe. "
"Frankly, if he's *this* easily seduced, throwing it away might be the best thing he could do for his fiancé. 

God what a cliché. Fell for the much younger nurse, eh? Fiancé was too busy and, let me guess, ""doesn't understand you like she does""? Is Sally ""mature for her age""?"
"Always enter a relationship assuming you can't change the other person. Her being cold about your anecdote on mustering up the courage to ask you out, and then her being insensitive about you crying would have been a huge red flag for me. I would have continued on with the evening and then be done with her after that.

Never date someone who doesn't validate your emotions. Listening to stories you've told before is sometimes nice to have in a partner too. I tell stories dozens of times but unless my SO is in a bad mood he'll happily listen (or at least pretend he's listening) and if he does happen to be rude enough to interrupt me saying he's heard the story I'll make him finish it for me, because half the time he doesn't actually remember the story.

At the end of the day OP. It's what you think will make you happy. Your wife is responsible for her happiness and you're responsible for your own. Ideally a married couple should care about the happiness of their partner but your wife doesn't appear to care very much, so you need to take care of yourself. "
It's just weird is all. It does seem to speak towards her own anxiety rather than any bad intentions. I don't really get adorable vibes from it tho
Pretensions to a higher social class. 
"And I expect you'd shut that shit down. But he won't. 

Take care of yourself, OP. You deserve better, and I hope he realises that, but you need to look out for yourself."
"So what you're saying is you have no idea what you make and what you spend each month? Budgeting is the solution to your immediate problem, we can't help at all without knowing stuff like that. Go find out, sign up for mint.com or something and plug your bank account in. There's almost certainly ways of improving the situation but we can't help without seeing anything."
"&gt;What if he only proposed to me so he could start having sex? 

If a guy can have a new woman every weekend, but chose to give up sex for an entire year in order to woo you, it's pretty obvious he isn't proposing only to have sex.

Besides, didn't you say that *you* wanted to have sex? It's not like he forced this on you; he was waiting for you to feel comfortable before proceeding. That's the mark of a gentleman, not a conman. "
"There is no difference between a strip club and this bachelorette party. You didn't receive any private dance, so your husband can't use the reasoning that this party was more private. Both dances were performed in front of a group.

You said it's okay for him to get lap dances. To me, that's more intimate than seeing a naked person.

You left as soon as people started getting naked. That was a good move on your part.

Your husband seems to have double standards. If he can't bother to see that..well...I don't know how to talk to an unreasonable person.

If he doesn't want you to be around male strippers, then he doesn't get to go to strip clubs either. It's only fair."
"The funny thing is, if you can call it that, is you didn't say you would keep it. You said IF you were going to take it down it would be after fixing up the place you actually live in. Comes across like you'd consider it but you have other priorities first.

Anyway, I would be tempted to do this through a letter. Explaining that you will no longer have contact with them, they are not welcome on your land and that you wish to be left alone. You will be civil in passing in the future but there will be no future discussion about your property. Remind them you have a lot of work to do to the house that you'll do in your own time, style but it will be well kept regardless. Remind them again that you just wish to get on with your life with no ongoing confrontations.

Something like that but more elegantly put."
"Whoa dude, I think he/she just meant that it's kinda rude and/or unhygienic to sit around naked in other people's houses."
"This is really, really cute. You sound like a great partner, and your wife sounds like a sweetheart! I think OP needs to consider this, especially as 'what if it hurts/bruises you?' was not discussed before sex."
"If that were really the case and how OP really felt she'd actually type it out in her post. Clearly she knows how bad the word is in most contexts, and doesn't see it as a completely ok word to say."
"I married my husband because I loved him and there was no one else I would rather go through life with.  ALL of life.  The good times and adventures, the sad times and struggles, the stressful times and challenges of parenting.  My husband is my partner, not just someone I'm attracted to and think is really really cool.  "
"If she pushes for more explanation just say ""Do you really want to have a long conversation about diarrhoea over dinner?""  It's a little abrupt but it ought to shut her down."
"Exactly. This is about teaching the kids consideration for others, which is also about teaching them how to be adults who others will want to have around. Teaching your social skills will only *benefit* your kids as they get older.

It's not about soccer, it's about parenting."
"Oh, ok.  That makes sense.

Fun is great, but kids need to understand that part of having fun is allowing *other* people to have fun, too, and that other people have fun in ways that they themselves might not find enjoyable (like watching a soccer match or the TV or something).

"
"I agree. She probably has some serious rose colored glasses about that relationship because it ended due to tragedy- not because of an inherent incompatibility. If there's *any* unhappiness in her current relationship, it wouldn't surprise me if meeting OP back to his healthy self has reignited the flame. "
Just remember that if Sally can't respect anyone's relationship boundaries enough to keep from inserting herself where she doesn't belong - she'll have no problem with doing that again with someone else if you become a couple. 
"Thank you for the support. Many people I knew acted appalled when they discovered how she neglected me after my surgery. I knew it was wrong, but I'm so damn forgiving. To a very big fault."
"Ignore her. She is hoping you will give her attention.


Get angry. She cheated on you. Devalued you. And *now* she wants your attention. Oh fuck no! She doesn't deserve it. It's natural to miss someone you shared a large part of your life with but you deserve a life with someone who doesn't treat you as expendable."
What kind of people are these that they could go out and enjoy the day together knowing that you are in sitting alone in his apartment? Not the kind of people you should waste a moment of your time on. Your boyfriend has ZERO respect for you 
"They didn't threaten to kick you out because you didn't say ""uh, no, you aren't spanking me, you have no right to do that.""  "
"To be fair, it sounds like dad and bro might not respect her female opinion very much. "
We just signed our first lease together yesterday. And one of my rings went missing :)
"Dad here.

I agree, OP should get out for the sake of her kids if nothing else."
"Awww, what a good resolution, I'm glad you're back together again."
"I don't want them there at all, even with an apology. Writing that letter is fucking insanely insulting, I was actually practically in shock when I read it. They should be kicked out. 

I'm not at odds ends with my coach, I'm sure he would end it with them if I really asked. "
"While he is definitely in the wrong, I think some of the other replies are going too far when they say he's an asshole and doesn't care about you at all. It sounds like he was going along with your idea of opening them gradually over time, he did one, and then it fell off of his radar while he was waiting to do another, ie it was benign neglect, not consciously disregarding the gift. And since that omission, you've had two presumably good years together, so keep that in mind before you do anything drastic. 

&gt;This complete lack of appreciation makes me not want to do anything like this again.

That said, you probably shouldn't do something like this again. Your intent was admirable, but it's apparent that romantic gestures like the love letters meant to be opened over time really don't move the needle for him. I'd wager that most guys' real feelings about something like this would be that it was really nice and they'd try to play along, but they wouldn't REALLY be into it. "

"Same situation as you (except my father is a piece of shit), but I think the financials are important here. I don't want nor have I ever truly missed having a relationship with my father, but he didn't pay child support either and it hurt me to see my mother struggle as hard as she did, and I missed out on things as a child that I may have had if we'd had just a little extra money (learning an instrument or a sport for example). The kids he had after he remarried had those things, and it's hard not to be bitter about it. (Though ftr I don't blame my half-siblings, and his wife has always been kind to me.) "
"""Honey, I know historically you haven't been very interested in our finances and investments outside of day to day living. But do you mind if I clue you in to some things?  For the past number of years I've maxed out our 401k, made sure we paid all our bills, made sure we have been able to live comfortably on our salaries and the rest I have been investing. It has gone better than I could have planned and I'm happy to say we have one less thing to worry about in our lives. I'd like to talk to you about setting some goals going forward that represent who we are and what we want, things like college funds, vacations, etc, and do it in a way that keeps us comfortable and grounded but also able to enjoy some new things together as a family.""

From what you've said, OP,  she hasn't been particularly interested in the financial side of family life. Regardless, be prepared for a hefty level of backlash if you have overtly lied about things to protect the omissions."
"Hon. I'm sorry. He's breaking up with you. It's not for the right reasons and he WILL regret it, and you are totally right, but you cannot save him from his mother. For your own sake, I would not be friends with him. End this. Go no contact for your own sanity. You need time to mourn this relationship. "
I am not saying that making money makes it alright.
Yes. Dani lied to her boss about a work issue. 
"This is fantastic, hits all the point and excellent advice, plus thank you for including the ADHD thing. I'll add that the way he turns it around on her and makes her feel guilty about *his* mistakes is a **HUGE** red flag about what she's in for in this relationship and how he'll handle future issues. Most empathetic people would be absolutely mortified to make a date wait like that once, let alone repeatedly. To read between the lines he sounds narcissistic and probably no good will come of this relationship.... these kind of people value their selves more than others and also tend to be controlling and damage a partner's self esteem by turning every issue back on them, like he's doing here.
Her tolerance towards being made to wait for hours time and time again with no apologies strikes me as the exact kind of person these people prey on. 

Also, what the actual fuck, this is 2016 right?? Who the hell doesn't have a cell phone, and why isn't he calling her to let her know he'll be late? I promise you OP, no good will come of this relationship, but if you'd like to give it a shot follow the above commenter's excellent advice and don't let yourself get sucked into his narcissism and games. "
"If anyone brings it up again, say ""Gross, why are you talking about porn at work? I don't think this conversation is appropriate."" and shut them down. You don't have to confirm or deny anything that they say. You need to be prepared to shut these people down in the future. Do not let them catch you off guard again."
I didn't think he was completely against LGBTQs but I guess he just hid it well. He always said he'd accepted me but would get really moody and mad about the subject when brought up. Just last night he said he was tired of gays constantly showing up on tv and said it wasn't needed.

"Have to jump on the cheating bandwagon. He is still with you waiting for the other one to get onboard. 

My soon to be ex wife was same as your husband. Everything was fine but she was just waiting her time with my ex best friend who was married too. Both with us had kids , good friends etc. 

One day you'll get the im love you but not in love with you speech. That is when the other party is onboard. 

I would tell him you heard the convo. What does he want to say about it. Or even go guns blazing and say you heard him and her and you filling for divorce. See his excuse"
"This isnt a debate, it's an advice thread that *you started*. You wanted validation for your feelings about your brother's relationship, which you got, but as soon as the masses also agree on something you didn't want to hear, you bust out the amateur internet logician stuff where it doesn't belong. Leave it at home and instead have a good and long think about what's been said to you here. It's a tough pill to swallow when a family member does something shitty."

That would be a deal breaker for me. It is controlling and incredibly disrespectful.
"Jumping on, but even ignoring the career aspect entirely (although it seems to be most important), Op, you're asking her to pull up her entire life and move across the country. I don't even know if I'd that for my own career, much less for sitting at the house - I'm reluctant to say ""home"" since I know it wouldn't feel like it for a while after we moved - while my partner is busy most of the time with their exciting dream career. 

If it's about yout being breadwinner, like you said in your tldr, then you should be ecstatic to take that job near your current home that pays more, right? But no. You REALLY want to get to pick 100% what you want, and you want your wife to concede to that more than you seem to want her to be happy. It made me sad to read this post, really. "
"That's... Really weird. I sure hope you're leaving a lot out. 

That's a really average piece of writing. Leaving someone for not thinking that that average piece of writing is as interesting as you believe it is is rather fucked up. Never mind the fact that your comment is barely coherent. "

It's her choice to make, but the logic there is a bit odd. It's like selecting the right car by test driving it only in the parking lot.

And ya know what? That's completely okay. 

&gt; I also feel like less of a man often as my friends all have sex.

The amount of sex you have has no bearing on your masculinity. Moreover, your friends likely overstate how much they are having. 

&gt; Leaving me a 20 something virgin, making it very hard to date again.

Do you plan to wear a shirt that says ""I am virgin""? If not, it doesn't make you hard to date. 

&gt; I am afraid this will make me bitter, and resent her, even though I value our relationship so much.

This is actually the real problem. You two have fundamentally different wants/needs in a relationship. You want a partner that's sexually active with you, she does not. You can have an otherwise perfect relationship but this fundamental difference can truly make all that perfection otherwise irrelevant because one of you is not getting their needs met. 

If you are not comfortable waiting for marriage (and frankly, I agree with you....waiting for marriage is a risky move), then I'd suggest really having a heart-to-heart discussion with her. Explain your concern about your needs and wants and see where she stands. It may spell out the end of your relationship, but that's okay. It's your first serious relationship and you are both so young. There are more fish in the sea and most of them are pretty hyped about fucking too. "

"This. I'm inclined to believe he doesn't mean or remember these outbursts and is kind of sleep tantrumming like he says. But the solution for him taking responsibility is clear: No sleeping on the couch!

He may not be consciously doing it but he needs to do something to show he can take some responsibility for his actions and fix this."
"I don't want to be a stereotype in this sub, but this goes a lot further than ""no sleeping on the couch."" She wakes up to him shouting and pushing her off the edge of the bed because she coughs? He hurls abuse because of a sneeze?

I don't see how him changing sleep venues is going to fix any of that. It will just make it slightly less frequent (maybe) and she'll still have an abusive cranky manchild who reacts in a completely irrational manner to the smallest infractions of his imaginary, always-changing sleep rules.

All of the shit she mentioned needs to stop and this guy needs to grow up about 15 years in maturity terms before this would be okay, IMO. I don't really see that miracle coming together, but I hate to be a fatalist. I think that couples counseling is the minimum acceptable step."

"Thank you! I'm really baffled by how much people are harping on this (particularly the comment that if the wife doesn't know, ""it is SERIOUSLY time for some sex-ed"", as if this is a knowledge gap equivalent to using Coke as a spermicide or something). It might be a little bit comforting for the wife, but it's not a big deal in any way."
"Yes, but apparently the considered opinion of qualified professional experts isnt enough for Mrs OP, so, y'know, what is the poor man to do except go over it again and again until Mrs OP realises that  DD is NOT a threat, and MM is just being a brat"
"This is a really tough situation, and so sad. Without the wife's cooperation, I don't think DD will be able to handle the living situation, even though OP is the only one willing to help.

"I don't even know why this is a big contention. Having someone live in your home, as a married couple, is an all or nothing situation. Either both parties are on board with that person sharing their space, or they're out. Roommates, family, live in nannies. One person says 'hey, I'm no longer cool with this living situation' - it's immediate, the decision is made, talk about the timeline, ensuring compliance with any legal agreements or applicable laws, notify the person to start looking for alternative accommodations, you've got 2/3/4/6 weeks, thanks for understanding.

It doesn't have to be an issue of who trusts who or whatever they're getting into in some of the other threads. Your wife is no longer cool with this person in your house. She goes."
"&gt; It's not really that out there..

That she'll start realizing she now has options for hot guys, and may consider dumping her BF to get with them? Yes that's possible I suppose, we see it here from time to time. But, I think we can give OP the benefit of the doubt - she does say she loves her BF."

What about setting up a small salt water tank in the house to give her a taste of the work that goes into maintaining and caring for something a little more difficult than a simple freshwater tank. Keeping the salt and other chemical levels in even a small salt tank is a pain in the ass, and that's nothing compared to a pool sized aquarium."

&gt;I've been staying at a colleague's place who lives close to my office. If my husband won't sleep in our home, I'm not going to, either. My husband has since accused me of cheating and disrespecting him. 

Is your colleague male? Because that's some straight up bullshit.

Even if there was literally zero chance you would even LOOK at that person in an inappropriate way in a million years, it's completely shady and would make ANYONE upset if they were upset and went to stay with a relative so their spouse went to stay at a colleague's house who is of the opposite sex? Nuh uh.

Y'all need to talk, for sure, but you don't get to play the innocent victim here. Your schedule and dedication to work has changed drastically and to an extent that would be a lot for anyone to handle. I think you have a lot of valid points, absolutely. I just think it's not as one sided as you're making it out to be."

I can't even schedule therapy. I have no money of my own anymore. If I'm lucky I get $50-100 a month to spend on everything I need.

"Because when you host people in your home, you should attempt to be a good host. That means trying to make your guests comfortable in your home. 

Now, it sounds to me like you don't actually want children in your home. You are well within your rights to feel this way, and you don't have to have them there. But you do need to tell your friends that first. ""Hey Joe, you know my house is not kid-friendly or kid-proof, so I think it's better if you come over without snotleigh, or we can meet out somewhere.""

"We all know that she has the right to do what she wants with her body, but her complete disregard of you and secrecy is not okay. I'm extremely pro-choice, but I don't agree with hiding things from your spouse. 

 &gt;I have strongly voiced my opinion that if two people are legally married, there should be some communication between the couple before getting an abortion etc - only if absolutely needed.

And has her stance changed? She agreed with it early on, but has she brought up anything? Voiced worries about kids? About the marriage? Anything? It's not justification for hiding things from you, but it might help you understand the why behind it. 

&gt;Why would she have these abortions without even talking to me?

Maybe she felt like it was the wrong time to have kids or had changed her viewpoints, and she didn't want to feel pressured to keep it? I'm not putting blame on you for her choices, just to be clear. 

&gt;How do I even talk to her about this?

Tell her honestly what you found. And ask her why she kept it from you in the calmest way that you possibly can. I would suggest that you two do couple's counseling. Obviously, this is an emotional topic, and a professional will be a good mediator. 

Edit: based on some of OP's replies, I'm starting to think she may actually be hiding miscarriages/health issues. While hiding something from a spouse is not a good thing, he mentioned that the paperwork said ""therapeutic abortion."" Someone please clarify that term if it doesn't mean what I think it means...

Talk. To. Your. Wife. OP. "
This is what motivates me to be more fit- I'm marrying my best friend and I want us to be old together and as healthy as long as possible. 
"Opening the marriage when it was already rocky was a bad move. You should go to marriage counseling at this point. You seem pretty dismissive of your wife's concerns and you have been admittedly avoiding her since opening the marriage. Has she been seeing anyone else during all this? 

I think you've made some selfish decisions here and should look at how you have contributed to the situation.

I think you need to break up with Ashley while you figure out your marriage. I think you need to stop avoiding your problems and try and work things out with your wife. If you don't have the energy for that than the marriage is over and you should talk to a lawyer. "
"You say you would want her to tell you. It's not up to your wife whether you tell her or not for so many reasons, this is your decision. Sounds like you want to tell her so do it for that reason alone. If it were me I would tell her. Edit you could always do the ""you tell her first or I will"" to her husband but really you can't get 100% proof he will not to mention you don't owe him anything"

"Yup, I could easily decide to have a pool aquarium and a shark pool and yet more things while in a hypomanic phase and nothing would convince me it was a bad idea.

"haha fair enough, agreed."
"&gt; I barely had my basic needs met as a kid.

You absolutely did NOT have your basic needs met as a kid. No barely about it. It's a bit of a miracle (and I'm sure a lot of hard work as well) that you have grown up and are in a stable relationship and in a stable financial situation.

You owe your parents nothing, and not just because they neglected you as a child. Even if they cared for you appropriately, you would still owe them nothing. Children do not ""owe"" their parents for being born.

The most you owe your parents is to point them in the direction of any social services they might qualify for. If they become homeless, give them the phone number for a homeless shelter and the local food banks. The homeless shelter might be able to help them find subsidized housing, although they may need to spend some time in the shelter before they qualify. If they become disabled, do not take legal or financial responsibility for them. Hospitals have social workers. Tell the social workers that you will not take your parents home and you will not provide for them. Children only have a legal obligation to provide for their parents in a few states. Social workers will often try to push children to take care of their indigent parents, but if your parents worked they should qualify for social security and medicare/medicaid.

Most of all... do NOT let them through your door with any bags. Once they are in your house they will never leave. 

ETA: You should also keep a hawk eye on your credit report. Your mother sounds like the type that would steal from you because she convinces herself you ""owe"" her. Password protect everything!"
"&gt; I think she handled things well, personally.

No, she handled them politely.  And missed her concert, and Dani and the manager got what they wanted.

&gt;She told her manager ahead of time that she needed the night off and she repeatedly told Dani no. That should have been more than enough.

""Should have"" is not how life works, unfortunately.  People ""should have"" the decency to not steal things, but we still lock our car door and don't leave our wallet on the front seat in a bad neighborhood.  Being an adult is acknowledging that while we hope things go well, when they don't you can't just sit on your butt and say 'well this shouldn't be happening, how dare they!' as people take advantage of you.

&gt; I also don't think we should feel obligated to live our lives in a paranoid, uncompromising state because we're constantly afraid we'll be taken advantage of.

You're saying this in a thread about someone who just got taken advantage of.

More than that, nothing about this situation forces paranoia or lack of compromise.  Dani's intentions were clear from the start, and the manager's inability and apathy in dealing with the situation was immediately apparent to OP.  When life gives you a gigantic red sign flashing ""YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE SCREWED, YOU KNOW IT'S COMING, EVIL PEOPLE ARE ASKING APATHETIC PEOPLE FOR FAVORS THAT HURT YOU! BE CAREFUL!"" you can't just wait until the last moment and say ""no!"".

And then when it goes exactly as badly as you knew it would, say ""wow, life sure is unfair"" instead of ""I probably should have done more to prevent this, even though it's unfair I had to"".

Think of it like this- if my health insurance double bills me for a procedure, it's not fair.  If I take a reasonable step in calling them to fix it, and they don't, I've 'handled things well' and it 'should' work out.

But if at the end of all that I still see double charges on my bill, you better believe I can't just assume it's been fixed- I need to get off my ass and fix it myself or else I'm in trouble.  If I sit back, it's my fault too no matter how shitty the company is acting.

&gt; I think it's important to acknowledge that when someone does wrong someone else, we focus the blame purely on the person who chose to do wrong, not the person who got screwed over.

Is this how the world should work?  Sure.

But if you see a car heading straight for you, and you stand there thinking *""they're not allowed to do that, I shouldn't have to change my life or be inconvenienced to deal with this""*  instead of stepping out of the way?  Yeah, you were right, but you're also dead.

So again, my advice to OP-  you can assume the world should be fair and blame all the bad people you want, but until you learn to start dodging the car you're going to be hurt a lot more than those of us who side-step no matter how unfair it might be."
"You insist on the prenup and now complain the way the lawyer is making sure she's taken care of?  An ex who is still her friend knows what she's worth. If you just expected her to meekly sign whatever your lawyer put in front of her, you're naive AND manipulative. You dug this hole yourself.  "
"I've never met Jenny as I live in the US and she is a Chinese native. Beavis has been clinging onto our friendship for the past five years.

"Exactly the right way to do it. 

When you commit to a time and then try to stall or change the time last minute,  you are disrespecting the time that everyone else took out of their days to spend with you.

We all feel it's incredibly rude of him to tell us in advance he will be some where,  but be 2 hours late.  

Rude,  disrespectful,  and selfish."
"As far as your cat goes, you could look into getting it fostered while you find somewhere to live alone?

Could be worth looking into it? "
"Your wife thinks sex with another man will somehow be the cure for her insecurities, but it's not going to work.  She invites him over and spends time with him because it feeds the need for validation that her insecurities make her crave.  However, that level of validation has become too little now.  She needs a stronger drug.  She wants to feel sexually desirable to another man.  And, it might make things better for a short time...but soon she'll need another man.  And another.  Because somewhere along the line she has convinced herself that fulfillment and satisfaction can only come from other people, not herself.

She doesn't need to fuck someone else.  She needs to get out of the house, find a hobby, and talk to a therapist.  And, if her only solution for getting her life in order is through sex with a man other than you, then what does that really say about your marriage?"

What??? NO, ONE IS NOT!!!  And even if she were the power imbalance is palpable.  He basically groomed her!  What kind of creepy, fucked up 46 year old is even interested in a 17 year old?  What could they possibly have in common.  The whole thing is so fucked up and wrong."
We thought that people understood that you don't eat whole tubs of ice cream by yourself or throwaway fresh food.
Go to a lawyer first. IANAL but it seems like could get in trouble for prostitution if the whole story comes out to the police. She needs to have her bases covered to protect herself on both ends. A lawyer will be able to walk her through what she needs to do.
"Take your future SIL out for ice cream. Give her a hug. Tell her you love her and you're happy she's going to be part of your family, and add that she and your brother have been wonderful for each other.

Then tell her that if she wants to talk about what happened at the 4th of July event, you're there for her, because that was awful. But also, you'd like to talk about her bridal and baby showers. 

You should organize those, OP, because having her sit through anything hosted by your mother, especially at your father's house, would be painful for her. Pinterest the hell out of some cute, thrifty ideas and bring your favorites; see what she thinks. Would she be prefer celebrating both at once, or separate events? This will be a 'tell, don't ask' situation with your mother. 

You're going to be giving the groom's family speech at their rehearsal dinner, too. If they don't elope after this.

Awful family sucks; it puts such a burden on young people. Feel free to hit your mom up for money to pay for all the things, and when you tell her what it's all costing you, keep in the back of your mind that, as hostess, you control the guest list. 

The thrust of all this, OP, is that you are now in a position to set the tone of your generation's family life for the years to come. You and your siblings, married in and original, are going to outlive your parents. Your mother, foolish woman that she is, just gifted you with her own role and power. Take it, but don't use it in the way she suggested. Use it to cement a bond between you and the woman who is about to have your first nibling. Start a cabal! Bwa ha haaaa!

Sorry. I'm done."
"It is his call to end the relationship.
"
"&gt; He was bullied 

Having a past that explains current behavior doesn't *justify* it. It may help you understand why he's become a bully himself, but in no way does this excuse his abuse towards others he considers weaker than himself.

This is the reddest of red flags, OP. If at nine months he's already showing you this side of him when you're still at the stage of putting your best foot forward, how soon before he's directing this anger at you?

He needs therapy. But that will only be effective if he does it for himself, not just to appease you, and first he must acknowledge that his rage is a problem and want to change. Even then it will be a long, hard, bumpy road, and you're not obliged to stick around for it. Your leaving might even serve as a wake up call for him. "
Agreed 100%. I wonder what else the husband is allowed to do that the wife isn't? SO wrong. 
I'm a little confused as to why you feel adjusting your level of physical contact with your sister is not an option. It is an option and one you should probably explore if it's causing problems in your romantic relationships. Can you and your sister not appreciate each other in ways that don't make it look like you're dating?
It's probably a good thing they don't like talking much when their heads are filled with all sorts of rubbish and nonsense. Imagine having to listen to their petty crap all the time.

"Do not pay for that. That is disrespectful to you and your future wife. Nobody should be trying to drive a wedge there. You need to stop paying for things. It will only get worse as she wants to move out and have babies. No she needs to stand on her own two feet. You have your own wedding and lifestyle choices to fund with money you work hard for. 

I am sorry about loosing your father young but allowing you sister to stay a spoiled child is not the answer to your view of you male responsibilities. Stick with your wife and your brother. At the very least make the money contingent on an invite for your fiancé. After all once you are married it is her money also. 

Also your mom belongs in r/raisedbynarcissists 

Edit: if you are worried about your word remember it was implicitly contingent on you and your fiancé getting an invite, one without being shafted sitting in the back with no make up and an ugly dress away from the only person she knows. at the least you can make the money contingent on what you had every right to expect you would get. "
"I would quit your job, unless you really need the money. Make sure that your boss knows that Dani lied and was really at the concert, and tell your boss that you are quitting because of how poorly the situation was handled.

Cut contact with everyone there and unless you really need to use this place as a reference, don't bother giving notice and just quit. Don't bother trying to get revenge, or try to embarrass Dani because it's just not worth it. The best thing is really to wash your hands of the situation.

Things like this suck, but at least you found out sooner rather than later that none of these people, even your boss, are your friend or are looking out for you. Your manager picked Dani over you because Dani made the bigger fuss and she knew you'd deal with it better than Dani would. This job doesn't deserve your loyalty. "
"Can't afford counseling.  Having a second child.  Something does not compute.

"Is that the guy who insisted on splitting the ice cream costs, and her mom was like, ""Aren't you lactose intolerant?"""
"I once read this in a Cosmo magazine. ""A guy who sees you on Sunday, then texts you on Wednesday to see you on Friday isn't a boyfriend. He's just making an appointment for sex.""

If there's no interaction between ""dates"" then I'm afraid he's not in this for the same reasons you are."
"So, I think you handled yourself very well:

1. You went to the party not expecting it to get that raunchy, and were given no heads up what was going to happen (shame on your host for not telling everyone invited that at XX:00, some gogo dancers are coming, I'm a guy and I wouldn't spring a group of strippers on them by surprise). 

2. You were not only keeping the boundaries you and your hubby had previously agreed up in mind, but you also left because you felt uncomfortable and didn't want to partake in the festivities. You are an awesome partner and a  keeper, OP, he's lucky to have you.

3. You told him immediately what happened and you were honest with him about what went down and gave him all relevant information.

&gt; The strip club being public and somehow restricted while the bachelorette party was happening in private and things could get out of hands and low and behold they did.

Let me tell you a little ""everyone knows"" secret about strip clubs. While a high percentage of strip club activity is as advertised (they do need to officially be above board to keep from running afoul of the laws in their city/state), and while some clubs in some areas are more strict than others, with the right tip and a willing stripper, you can have basically as raunchy of a time in a VIP room at a strip club as what happened at that private party. I suppose it's easier to cut loose and even have full on sex in a private home, but some strippers are also escorts who will discretely offer additional services outside of the strip club to some strip club goers. Bottom line, don't buy his ""there is a huge bright line at the strip club that is impossible to cross"" line when that isn't the reality.

&gt; He says he didn't have a woman flaunting her naked body (he used crude terms) up his face like me.

That is the most laughable fucking bullshit I have ever heard (I laughed out loud). Even at the strictest bikini clubs, where anus, vulva and nipples have to be covered, it's still not very far from what he describes here to be even a meaningful distinction. And in a regular full nude strip club, that is exactly what happens if you sit in the front row or get a lap dance.

So, what the heck is up with your hubby? Since it's been a few days, where he can process his feelings against the facts that are completely reasonable, there's only two things I can think of to explain his irrational and over the top behavior:

1. Extreme insecurity. Again, I don't know why since you handled the situation so well. Maybe he has body issues, and the pictures of the fit and well endowed gogo dancers, combined with the fact that you were able to see everything first hand, triggered it? This seems silly since you've had a strip clubs are okay boundary.

2. Projection. This is a bit scary to consider, but maybe he's crossed the ""strip club"" boundary in the past and thinks you have done the same since you were given the opportunity, regardless of the facts and what you actually did. This would explain the irrational way he's handling this."

If she persists with this passive crap, she's only hurting herself by alienating her family.

Based on your description of that whole conversation between you and your wife, you two need some *serious* counseling on communication and I'm glad you're taking steps towards that. Just reading that whole exchange was exhausting. Like pulling teeth or nailing Jell-o to the wall.

The most worrying part to me is that your wife kept saying she just doesn't care. If that's the case, then I don't know if therapy will help anything. Fixing a marriage takes two people. 

Good luck. "

Likely, she's like this because she can be. I'm assuming you make more money than she does, so why should she work more hours? You clean the house so why should she bother? You even bring her lunch for her! 

You have a baby coming, so I suppose you could try therapy, but that's about all I've got. "

"My dad is homophobic (and racist and anti-semitic). He also immigrated to the US and put us through school and was a stay at home dad when we moved for my mom's better job (which was hilarious. I couldn't even eat the first few meals he ate and he was really hurt but I was fairly young and just couldn't.) and owns the car I currently drive and takes me to the gym to teach me to be healthier. I never agree with the homophobic things he says and he knows it. I'll ask him to stop talking about it. Sometimes he doesn't, sometimes he does. But I hope he knows that I love and appreciate him even if I don't agree with him.

"If you don't take her back...and she kills herself out of desperationa nd depression and pain...will your daughter be able to sleep at night? Your wife? You??

If you take her back and MM pushes DD to kill herself via horribly cruel behavior...same questions apply. 

There is a valid safety issue here: MM is not safe for DD. MM must get a job and move out NOW so DD can come home...or...MM will go to family counseling with DD every week to ensure DD is safe. If MM treats DD like shit, MM will leave. Make sure to discuss this issue with your pastor to help MM get spiritual guidance from people she looks up to. MM is not doing her religion right by treating DD like this...and I certainly would not want someone so devoid of empathy around children! 

They want to play hard ball...OP, you must stand up for DD. She needs you. MM is using you. There is a very big difference. MM needs to know you know what she is doing...and that there are consequences for her actions. If your wife leaves...she is making that choice, not you...and again, she has a lot of soul searching to do. I cannot believe they think they can act like this and be good-standing members in their church. Bring their actions to the light and let them try to justify it to the pastor. They are being horrible."
You don't seem to care much about your friendship with Matt and this seems to be weighing on your conscience so I'd do it. Just be aware that Anna might not take it seriously because she doesn't know you.

She doesn't need to do anything. He is choosing not to live like she is willing to. That's on him.
"To hell with showing up at his work. Tell your daughter if she'd like to pack a bag you'll help her to see the reality of her situation. Let her know that you love her and that this might be a difficult lesson but that she needs a dose of reality.

Explain to the wife that your daughter has a relationship with husband and wants to move in.

I know this seems harsh and cruel but better this than the ""relationship"" continuing. Imagine if she were to become pregnant or leave school over this man!

I have a feeling that will end things pretty quickly. "
The right thing to do is support DD I think you mean
"It honestly sounds like he isn't comfortable that you make more and is jumping at the opportunity to get you to stop so he can feel better.

He isn't using logic at all here.  You staying at work is what is best for your family.  Is he insecure in other parts of the relationship?"
"Bugger. If having a partner who views him as genetically male until the ""big reveal"" is important to him then you have a big problem. Obviously you could have phrased ""I didn't realise you were trying to pass"" better but you know that and, as you say, you were surprised. 5ft 1 was also a huge giveaway, you're right. If his ego is pinned on the idea that he totally passes though he probably wont forgive you for knowing what sounds pretty bloody obvious. Ahhh what a sucky situation. Good luck.  
There is a sub here somewhere where people post pics and ask if they ""pass"". If he really needs a reality check suggest he goes there. If he doesn't pass it clears you but might depress him....but if he doesn't find out he doesn't pass then he will make the same mistake again."
"He has a hard time accepting blame because it makes him feel terrible????  How is it supposed to feel?  Happy and at ease?  Thrilled to be truthful?  

This is a pathetic excuse. 

Emotionally he is a child. If he can say to you with a straight face that he can't be honest because it hurts his feelings, don't let him get away with it. It's not okay to escape responsibility because it hurts to be responsible. "
"Constant excuses. A refusal to even consider taking his wife's ""side.""

Not saying OP is a bad guy, but he needs to consider how he wants his wife to feel, and then he needs to act appropriately."
"You hope he apologizes?  You can help your wife by being properly angry with your father.  He crushed your *pregnant* wife to tears and questioning whether you were being honest about your feelings about your family with her.  Everyone knows the adverse effects stress can have on pregnant women.  Him not knowing science of sex determination should be the least of your worries.  When your wife is ready (because she deserves some space from him), your father needs to apologize to her in person or however she is comfortable.  As an outsider, what he did comes off as extremely manipulative because, while you're satisfied with the life you and your wife have built, it seems he's working on getting his grandson.  I can't imagine the figurative dagger she felt through her heart when he said such terrible things to her.  Don't try to find years old breadcrumbs your father might be building off of.  He was out of line pure and simple.  If he was so concerned about your feelings he should have talked to YOU (not your pregnant wife) since it's *your* family and *your* decision.  It's not his business to meddle in you and your wife's reproductive decisions even if you were bummed (which you weren't). 

I'm just so sorry for your wife.  All you can really do is re-assure your wife that you love her and your family and your dad made the whole thing up.   Also, like I wrote, take a break from seeing your dad for a while to give your wife some space.  "
"Jon is not doing Brian any favours by continuing to be a buffer for him. He NEEDS to explain to Brian that people don't just not like him for no reason but it's because of his awful, selfish behaviour. I get the sense that you get this, but really need to convince Jon to do something about it. Frame it that by allowing his friend to continue being like this, he's actually letting his friend get further and further from anyone else ever wanting to tolerate him, never mind be friends with him. Talk to the rest of the group outside of Jon and see if you can make a united front, and explain to Jon that while he thinks he's being nice to Brian, Brian is one person and he's making life shittier for 8 other people at the same time every time Brian is allowed to toxically infect any hangout.

Maybe a larger intervention with the other people in that friend circle would be ideal."
"&gt;She has this weird sisterly bond thing that she believe we have going on but it doesn't ever feel like it at all.

That ""weird sisterly bond thing"" that you don't feel at all... yeah, that doesn't exist. She wants to keep you as her personal slave and possibly use your inheritance from your parents to keep her lazy lifestyle afloat. She'll claim she always needs money all the time to pay for your upkeep, but she'll be skimming that money off the top. Adding insult to injury, the minute she finds another sucker (i.e. boyfriend) to support her, you'll be out on your ass. Very few men would want to support their SO's little sister in addition to their SO, so you'll be out of luck."

"I don't know if there's any legal documentation you can get and carry with you to ""prove"" you're her step-dad, (your marriage certificate and her birth certificate?) but it might be worth it to do something like that. I assume she also has a dad in the picture and you can't just legally adopt her? 

It sucks that you even have to consider stuff like this, but that's the world we live in.

As far as picking her up from school/camp, it would be a good idea to introduce yourself to all of her camp counsellors/any teachers you can and to get involved in parent groups to make it widely known within your social circles that she is your stepdaughter and cut down on strangers in those places calling the cops.

"We're not saying that your wife isn't honest. What we're trying to say is that your wife doesn't seem to be very good at prioritizing her own needs, and we're advocating for a marriage where both of your needs are *equally* taken care of.

It would be a loving gesture to ask her to go see a therapist to make sure that she isn't one of those people."

"&gt; If he doesn't apologize profusely that's when I'll really start to insider getting out.

You'll ""start to consider"" getting out if he doesn't apologize. But not when he almost kills you? Your normal meter is very seriously broken. You do know that abusers apologize, right? His apology is going to sound a lot like ""I only did it because you..."" and ""When I'm drunk, you shouldn't..."" He'll apologize, but he'll also tell you how it's all your fault that he almost killed you. Why the hell are you sticking around until morning????"

"OP, I think you understand the situation pretty well, and I think you should bring up your new-found knowledge to them.

"You might need a different counsellor to deal with this--they aren't experts in all things.

"I was responding to the idea that the only motivation for not wanting to tell the wife is out of affection. It could clearly be her trying to avoid the fallout her actions caused. 

I'm of the opinion that it takes only one person to destroy a marriage: the cheater, not the cheater and the person they used to cheat.

So yes, each person destroyed their own marriage. That doesn't mean the wife won't feel awful about enabling the other guy to destroy his own marriage."
"Seriously? Do you really need to ask her this? If I found out something that was going to be mine gets spent on something else what would you think? Would I be so mean-sounding, or do you think it would be a reaction to my position?"
"Gonna second this, even if you don't believe in God clergymen are pretty good people to talk to themselves. They're trained in basic counseling, not clinically, but as long as you aren't coming to ask about issues like abortion or coming out of the closet I've found them to be pretty caring and willing to listen. I went to a catholic school as an atheist in high school, and the Brothers that tought there were a great help. Sure sometimes they'll say 'that's gods will' or 'you have to have faith that the lord will make it ok', but only in circumstances where you really do need to accept that you have no control.  "

Why can he suddenly ask her to hide her body now that he sees it as more desirable to everyone? Because he thinks what will happen? 

Everything is the same as before. The difference now is that he wants her to change her actions (that he's not given a fuck about for three years) because he thinks she's more attractive.

"OP I really hope you read this advice.

If you communicate like this the best I have some excellent advice for you.  I do this with my wife.

***Get a journal.***  Don't get a shitty one.  Go out and buy a *beautiful* one.

Each of you write an entry a week *minimum*.  Write the date, then write what you did together that week, what you love about each other, about relationship goals and achieving them, what you want to do together in the future... Hell, wife and I even wrote out an vacation plan than synopsis of the best parts of the trip more than once.  Write to her or just write for her to read, just write.

The one rule is that you don't ever write anything negative.  That you *talk* about.

Years later, when you're old and grey, or on the horrible day when one of you passes the other will have the journal, and can look back at how much you love each other, how much you grew, and how happy you made each other.

Write."
"This so much. I was on a business trip to LA that lasted a week. One day of the conference was truncated (like 2-3 hours only), so we went to Disney Land for the rest of the day. The first day started late, so our company ""treated"" us all to massages. 

My dad often had golf outings on business trips he went on when I was a kid. He always took his clubs with him, because even though it was mostly work, many of the top people in the company would golf together. 

Just because he had a massage at the hotel one day and was doing touristy stuff another doesn't mean this is a secret vacation."
"Don't recommend relationship counselling in obvious abuse cases. It's used for further control, and makes it even harder because it's making the abused person more self-blaming, and more ""well, if I finally find the magic right thing to do... this is in my hands! I can fix his complete lack of respect for me!"". It never ever makes things better for the abuse victim and it delays their safe leaving of the relationship. The longer they're there the worse their chances of survival. He's attempting to fully isolate her before getting her pregnant and pregnancy is the top time to ramp up abuse. Male partners are pregnant women's top cause of death"
"The biggest (and hardest) part will be staying calm. Breathe slowly, don't react to her threats or tears with an emotional response.

She'll want to draw you into a dialogue and try and wheedle her way back in. Be firm, open, honest and calm. Even if you're shitting your pants, don't let it show on your face. Do your best to save your breakdown till you're away from her."
Damn you're the bomb for that take down.
"You're being down voted and maybe I will too, but I don't understand either. It's over and done and it seems like running around telling Laney's family members how awful you felt her wedding ceremony was seems rude. It's none of anybody else's business whether Laney and her new husband believe these things. If Laney starts showing signs elsewhere that she's in an abusive relationship then that's a totally different issue. 

Edit to add: I had a non religious ceremony for my wedding. My husband and I read each other some poetry and our parents made a speech. End ceremony. There was a small number of guests afterwards who felt it was appropriate for them to say that my wedding wasn't ""insert religion, insert romantic, insert traditional, insert whatever"" enough for them and you know what? That was super rude. OP, your friends wedding ceremony isn't something you should make negative comments on and I'm not sure what you think it will do other than make you seem rude. "
If porn is a deal breaker then stop messing about and break up with him.

"If they have a daughter, will he shame her for having a period too? Will he silence her every time she wants to ask her mom a women's health question? When she's fourteen and gets her period for the first time will he make her feel like there's something wrong with her? 

This is more than just blatant disrespect to OP. This is a harmful stigma that needs to be shut down. Like yesterday. "
It really sounds like the brother has gotten inside hubby's head. :(
"I'm friends with a couple of my exes, and the secret to making it work with your new relationship is TRANSPARENCY. You utterly failed at that. You should have told your boyfriend immediately that this guy was your ex boyfriend. I'm not sure why you never mentioned it. So to your boyfriend, it is super shady that you were keeping this a secret. And he only finds out after you already booked your trip to go visit him alone? Nope. I would have broken up with you also. 

Next time, try being honest with your partner and taking their feelings into account when you make major decisions. Tends to work out much better. "
Excellent post. 110% Truthbombs. 
Make sure your manager knows you're leaving at the end of your shift no matter what. And do it. 
"&gt; Seven months later, we've both stopped pretending she's ever going to pay me back.

Why exactly?

&gt;Now she's unhappy again and wants to move somewhere else.

Tell her there's the door. She's perfectly capable of moving wherever she wants to. Stop enabling her by subsidizing her lifestyle. Kick her the fuck out of your apartment. If you're paying rent, and she's not, she needs to go. Maybe she'll learn the value of money then. 

More likely she'll latch onto the first man who will support her.

"&gt;He doesn't seem to want more. He is okay with earning 10k a year.

Having wildly different plans for the future is a valid reason to break up with somebody. Sleep on it for a few days, talk to him about where he sees himself in 10 years. And if that answer isn't compatible with yours, he's not compatible with you."
"&gt; My mind races at night and I can't stand not having something to focus my mind on while I fall asleep. I start focusing on my breathing, thinking worst-case scenarios, etc.

That sounds like anxiety.  Do you have other symptoms of anxiety during the day? This is something you should speak to a doctor about, because it's not entirely healthy to require stimulation in order to prevent your mind from spiralling out of control.  Looking at a screen before bed (within a few hours, even) prevents you from sleeping properly during the night.  This has become a crutch that you need to deal with.

You need to compromise with your girlfriend for now.  Use your phone and lay on your side with ear buds in, so she can sleep and you can still get your screen time.  And see a doctor."
"He's not a peacekeeper, he's behaving like a coward. The only reason there is peace is because you aren't making a strong enough stand. He's allowing them to treat you like a second class citizen and prioritizing them and their rudeness of you.

His friends are rude to you and he allows it. They don't have to love you or be BFFs with you, but they need to not pull this shit."
"No, people laid into you for invading your wife's privacy. If you were concerned, you could have sat her down later on and asked her if she was hiding something from you, why she took an Uber in the middle of the day and seemed upset."
"Ok and I'm reading in recent comments that you both had more specific conversations than just vague ""when we are settled"" statements. However you also say every time you brought up marriage she'd brush it off. So I'm a bit confused on which it was. Did she always brush it off or were you both in agreement that you were going to take the next step (marriage after buying a house)?

To me hun that says something. Actions speak louder than words. She brushed it off because she wanted to live in the moment and put off the heavy for ""later."" She agreed to take the next step maybe coasting and procrastinating the inevitable in her mind until, whoops, too late, time's out. Regardless your girlfriends reaction of becoming an ice queen, stone walling you, running away to the other side of the country and refusing to communicate beyond ""I'm fine"" for TWO WEEKS is also very telling. A day is one thing. Even 3,4,5 days. A week at most. But two? Your girlfriend isn't being a good, kind or fair partner. She's not acting like a partner at all.

The last part of my last comment still stands because to me the writing is on the wall. Your relationship is doomed. I could be wrong, in fact I hope I am. But you need to insist she comes home and work on whatever the issue is with you or you need to start discussing the division of property and assets. If she refuses to communicate and work with you, you don't have a relationship. Tell her she has until the end of the week to come back and work with you on it. You'll even fund the trip yourself. But she's had more than enough time to figure her shit out and come back to earth. You can't wait indefinitely nor should you. Timelines. Boundaries. And then stick to them.

Good luck"
"OP, I have no true advice as I've never been there. However, someone who was, and made a post about it yesterday, had this to say. I feel like it's up to you if it applies or not:

&gt;for those of you who got cheated on and are trying to work it out, I promise it's better if you leave. You will never truly get over it and I guarantee you a new relationship with a faithful partner will always be better than the old relationship with a cheater. I'll bet my life on it. People do come back from infidelity, yes, but you will be happier in a new relationship. I swear it."
"&gt;And, people can die from allergies

Yep. Allergy reactions can change. Some people get better and the symptoms disappear, but some get worse. If Simon was pressured into eating something that caused him to stop breathing, would that woman even know what to do? Would she call 911, or would she accuse him of faking?"

I'm a bit surprised about the general opinion over here that he doesn't get to decide over her relationship with his sister. I posted something similar a few weeks ago because my boyfriend demanded that I become friends with his four sisters and their children. Everyone said I'm supposed to accept the package deal since I chose to be with someone who has siblings. Reddit is weird.
"I'm going to be the asshole who says, dude, snoop. 

You've given her time, though you didn't really have a choice, as she bolted after twelve years with little explanation. I find it odd that she left her laptop there. You obviously love her a lot; there's no way she doesn't know she's got your heart in a blender right now. This is unfair as hell and super disrespectful. Assuming she comes back, do you think you'll be able to start back right where you left off? 

Look for answers. It's rude, yes, but it's much more forgivable than what she's done, assuming she ever finds out about this. Desperate times."
"&gt; I realized he was in one of his moods 

'one of his moods' + literally renting a separate apartment specifically to get away from him looks pretty bad, to be honest.

Girl, you deserve better. Time to move in there full-time and not look back. Take someone with you when you go back to get the rest of your stuff (even if you think for sure that he's not home at the time); if he's already following you inside to egg you on, unplugging the internet, and threatening to lock you out, it honestly sounds like he could get irrational and even physical if he realizes you are *actually* *leaving*.

Be strong, but more importantly be safe."
"Adoptive dad here.

This is very simple.  With a simple solution.

Get a babysitter, go over to your in-laws.  Lay the following choice out for them.

They either treat your children in such a way there is zero question of their love, devotion, and support as all the other grandchildren, OR they are no longer part of your family.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news but your responsibility is to YOUR CHILDREN.  Your in-laws are directly harming your children.  Your children can and will see it.  It will directly impact their self image.  And when they grow up, they will want to know why their parents didn't protect them at a young age.

While having extended family, grandparents is great.  When grandparents are causing direct harm to your kids, you need to do what needs to be done.  

Either the in-laws get their shit together or you cut them out of your life.

My wife and I had these exact discussions with her parents and my mom.  Treat our oldest (biological) son and our youngest (adopted) the same.  We informed them that we ever caught a whiff of favoritism, they would be cut out.  There were no second chances, there were no explaining yourself.  Our priority is our kids and while I love my mom, she would be cut off immediately and permanently if she treated my youngest son different.  

We did have the additional complexity of being in the South of the US and my son is a different race than my wife and I."

"Shift work is an absolute bastard on the body. Particularly the sort of rotating shifts you'd be doing.

Monitor your health and wellbeing closely - perhaps get a close friend (not your BF) to keep an eye on you as well. Some people do really badly on night shifts, so be aware of this, particularly if you are prone to panic attacks.

As for your BF, be aware that it might be a slow death for your relationship if you just can't see each other as much. 

Or spend some of that extra money you make and get someone to drive you to his place :)"

"That's why she hid it from you

Btw people in chronic pain will resort to anything. 

I have a pinched nerve and bulging disk. And I tried physical therapy , muscle relaxers and medications.  This went on for 2 months. I was ready to see a witch doctor.  Then my doc gave me steriods to ease inflammation and OMG sweet relief. 

I look back now (this is still recent though) and laugh at how desperate I got. I mean I am a mom to two. But we are so active , I work , I work out , we travel etc.  I went from zipline and hiking with my pre teen kids to not being able to lift my left arm. 

When in pain, it's amazing what lengths we go through (medical and otherwise ) "
"Because this only started after the other brothers got girlfriends- I think the issue is her insecurity at seeing the other girls. Nothing is going to change that. If they start choosing different activities, she'll know it was because of her and that her boyfriend would rather be playing those games with the athletic girls she can't keep up with. 

It's a no-win situation because *it's not about the game*. It's not about the shit talking. It's not about the activity. It's about seeing these two other women who fit so much better into the family than she does."
"Well, I mean, I am no expert.  But I heard that Autistic people are pretty non verbal and her preferring texting could be because she's autistic.  It was on this sub that someone told me that.  I mean, I hate talking on the phone too, but it's mainly because of my accent.  People can't understand me and I have to repeat myself over and over again.  And I remember reading somewhere (long before I met her) that Autistic people don't really show affection like other people do.  

Or it could just be that she didn't want me to kiss her because it was just a one night thing at that point and she didn't want to get attached.  Idk.  She let me kiss her this weekend though, so I guess it's not an issue.  "
"Some of the shit your wife says is downright cruel and guilt-trippy. I won't tell you to leave or anything but that is some shitty stuff to be telling your husband.

I'd say she's probably really tired, but that gives her no excuse to be such a dick to you/dismiss you and what you're saying.

Also, you telling her September will bring cash and her saying ""it never gets better"" just strikes me as her either just not listening to you or just her being a fuckin idiot.

Red flag: putting the blame on you concerning her thoughts of divorce, as if it's exclusively her fault.

Honestly, sorry if this comes off as rude or harsh, but your wife seems straight up incompetent at socializing/conversing/discussing shit with you.

Also: her saying that you becoming able to work more once school is out is ""just talking"" and ""avoiding the issue"" is just her avoiding your points in favor of holding the right to be mad at you. That's just fucking shitty and dismissive and it's not how somebody should treat their significant other.

Tl;dr: she's being an asshole and deliberately dismissing valid points because life is a bit harder for a short period of time."
He's going to message you in a bit wondering why you aren't begging him to take you back. 
"I did ask her. She said its fine. I knew it wasn't. Spa Day might be pushing it with her rib. ""That thing is she loves that you don't"" doesn't exist anymore I learned to like them all around our 10th year together. But she might like a trip to Nice, she was talking about it fleetingly."
"I agree, the problem is that he's pretty immature for a 25 year old, and OP has her shit together. He can't schedule his own eye doctor appointment, while she's paying a mortgage. *Maybe* he's saving like 50% of his salary for investments and retirements, but I think he would have mentioned that if it were the case. 

Friends may think that OP and Erik complement each other by being so different, but it sure sounds like she'd be better matched by someone else who is more ambitious and financially responsible. I'd be super turned off too by a 25 year old who is so extremely dependent on their parents. I'm not attracted to kids - and this dude is behaving like one. Gross. "
It is a term of affection. Can we not be offended for OP?
Hah yes. What's not to love? I guess I'm going to have to take a page out of the Lyanna Mormont playbook.
"She will have a licensed supervisor over her, and I think you should ask who that is (which you have the right to) and contact them. If you can't figure it out, you can 100% call her school and find this out. Her rotation would want to know about this level of concern. You don't need to give anyone all these details, just that you have concerns over a situation. 

I'm a licensed clinical psychologist, have trained grads in a previous job, and I would sure as shit want to know about this. Yes, maybe the therapist is missing info and your brother has fooled her, but still this is way out of line. It's questionable to have asked you to take him in in the first place, but terrible to have pushed it. 

I'm very sorry this happened, and don't have to feel bad about saying no to this mess. "
"Talk.....to.....your.....wife

Single text response:

""Due to the demeaning way you have spoken to me I am no longer interested in talking to you about this matter. Please do not bring this up again"".



Any time she starts, walk away (or hang up, or ignore the texts...whichever is appropriate). Stick to it. 


And you *do* want to dismiss her opinions. Because it is your body, not hers."
"I know this will sound harsh and I swear I'm not trying to be an asshole, but you are a placeholder. You will always get brushed aside when something or someone ""better"" comes along. It sucks, and I've been in your shoes. I don't know what was to be happening at the lake, but if he wanted to he could have just asked the inviter if he could bring you, right? Or did the inviter specifically ask fwb not to bring you? You two are definitely not seeing this relationship in the same way. I think he's a jerk and you can do better. "
"One thing that basically all the conventional treatments and methods fail at is human contact.

We know that often a very effective thing is for another human being to spend time listening to you, and then to authoritatively state things will be OK.

To the point that trials of the placebo effect have included things like an extended physician consultation, and then to state that ""Often in cases like this, a placebo has been found to be really help.  Do you know what a placebo is?  It's a pill without any medication in it.""  This has been found to be more effective in symptom relief than not treating or treating with a placebo without the explanation.

In general, the medical profession fails at this type of human contact and reassurance, both because of constraints on time and reimbursement, and because it's not considered ethical to just make crap up and lie to your patients even if most people would be helped by it.  Quacks have no problem delivering this experience, and this experience often helps.

tl;dr-- if it works for her, let her do it.  It probably actually helps her, even though us skeptics would have a hard time getting a benefit from it."
"You had an abusive father and now you have an abusive husband. Just as your father got worse with time and age, so will your husband. Your son is growing up witnessing and experiencing this. It's a fair bet that he is also either being abused directly, or by proxy watching your husband mistreat you. If things continue on this path, he will grow up to repeat this pattern either as abuser or victim. 

Do I understand correctly? "
"Next time they knock on your door tell them politely but firmly that the tree is on your property, it is not breaching any rules and you will decide to cut it down or not as you see fit. Then say you will not discuss this with them further and in fact so not wish to have anything to do with them due to their behaviour thus far. Tell them that they are harassing you and they need to stop knocking on your door and approaching you and that if they do not cease, you'll be forced to escalate this by seeking a restraining order, which you really don't wish to do, so you hope they can respect your property and your desire for them to leave you alone!"
It wasn't an accident. You purposefully cheated on your wife and jeopardized your entire family to get your rocks off for one night. You better start taking responsibility for yourself if you want to have a chance of your poor wife forgiving you. 
This relationship is dry! 
"Eh, I came into this prepared to be like, you're 18, this relationship is unlikely to last anyways, but if Jaz is hostile and bitchy to his gf and they don't have boundaries (I mean they did lots of stuff the gf is uncomfortable doing in public), I totally understand where the gf is coming from. I don't think it's heartless if you don't empathize with someone who's overtly shitty to you.

Edit: Even though this relationship might not be worth not supporting friend Jaz, I think she's going to cause lots of problems in your future relationships. One of the basic rules of non-same-sex best friendship is that you're incredibly respectful of each other's relationships, you have super solid physical boundaries, and you give each other space. None of this is happening with you and friend Jaz. Your future relationships are going to be... interesting."

"Joint/couples therapy is NOT recommended in abusive relationships like this. The abuser just uses material from the sessions as ammunition, and can manipulate the therapist. It's just not a good idea. Abusers cannot be fixed in couples counseling.

"Your username is quite odd and that alone should make you realize that your friendship isn't as platonic  (or at least appears) as you try to make it sound.  Ilovethemboth? Come on.  

Your wife should be considered your best friend, not Callie. 

You spend more time with Callie than most people do with their own significant others. 

Your whole post is talking about your relationship with Callie, not much about your wife.  

You have made no effort to see it from your wife's perspective, which was the most offsetting to me. You just ignore what the commenters say and deflect and whatnot.   

Spending as much time as you do with Callie would be innapropriate no matter what she was to you. No matter what her gender, appearance, blood relationship. This probably would be unusual for anyone.

 It sounds like your wife struggled for a long time trying to be that cool spouse who didn't care that their partners spend absurd amount of time and effort into other people, but finally got sick of putting up with it. And maybe because Callie is single that she has become more of a threat. Jealousy for sure, but it seems understandable. Never been in this situation but it sounds really shitty. This is why many girls avoid dating guys who have a female best friend and vice versa. Why not just avoid all this way too common drama all together?  

It sounds like you want us to just agree with you. It sounds like when it comes down to it you would pick Callie. We shouldn't be getting that vibe that your wife means not as much, which is seems it clearly is the case despite what you say. If we can can sense it through a screen, I can't imagine the magnitude your wife must feel. :/ 

You need to have a frank discussion with your wife and see if there's any room for compromise. This is mostly your fault for not setting reasonable boundries way earlier as you should have. You need to stop spending so much time on Callie, stop meeting her everyday and texting all day long. It's innapropriate. Opposite sex friendships can work great and many do, but not like this.  

Though have to question if you really want to work things out.

Best of luck.

The best advice I could give you on this thread is to post this over at r/TIFU as well.
"Is this negativity from your family really what you want to carry on into your new life with your husband? I don't think uninviting them would be an over reaction at all.

I think it's disrespectful for them to berate you and people who are not invested in your happiness do not deserve to celebrate your big day with you, OP. The next time they say something to you, just tell them if that's how they truly feel, they shouldn't come to the wedding."
"Put the wedding on hold. You NEVER, EVER marry someone without knowing their financial position. If you are getting married you are automatically tied to her credit so it is your business to know."
"I agree fully. There is no difference between OP's dad and those two.
OP's dad is lucky he didn't offend anyone with his sexist remarks while those two did.
He is 58, not 98 so he should be capable of changing his behaviour as well as the next person.
"
He said you ruined his life by cheating. You did not cheat. The life-ruiners were the liars who told you that you cheated when you were blackout drunk. He should know the truth even if he doesn't end up wanting to get back together again.
"Wow, definitely go no contact. On top of everything else he's try to control you too."
"&gt; I know it's dishonest

"I second this. I think he viewed your dog as a piece of furniture he thought he was going to talk you in to ditching if you guys got serious. 

My husband and I each had 5+ year old pets when we started dating. Now ""his"" dog sleeps on my side of the bed and ""my"" cat fights to cuddle on his chest. Any rules about the pets (such as if they can sleep on the bed) are made by both of us, no demands or sudden ""not allowed"" statements. 

He sees the dog as an accessory, not the large aspect of your life that it is. I think it's the type incompatibility that will infect you both with ever increasing resentment if you continue on hoping the other person will suddenly change to your point of view.

It's better to agree to disagree now then be filled with hate and anger down the road. 

"
"Pets too. You never think anyone could hurt a defenceless animal until they've picked up your dog and won't put them down. 

"
"I wouldn't assume that the thing you're self-conscious about is the precise thing that is preventing him from texting you. Honestly, yes, a bad smell from anywhere can be a turnoff, but I'm not sure it would cause complete ghosting. For me personally, I'm all about communication, even the awkward stuff. So I would recommend asking him about it, and reassuring him that that's not your normal smell(that is assuming you would want to hook-up again). "
"Look, at this point, you're literally risking your life by not going to the police. What your family might think won't matter if you're dead or seriously hurt. Do the smart thing and go to the police. "

"You have a massive age gap and have only been together for six months. The fact that you're talking about marriage is actually a **red flag**. *At least one of you* should be mature enough to recognize that this is entirely too soon to even think the word marriage, much more so in a relationship already disadvantaged by the age gap."
"That's a really good idea and one that we discussed before - which is why in surprised by her reaction. I think the realisation that she won't see any of the children she's built relationships with for the past few years again, is becoming more tangible and emotionally overwhelming. "
"My initial reaction was that you should screen-shot that shit and show it to your boss + manager and/or girl scouts and/or post it publicly online.

I then realized that although it might provide some sweet revenge, it also could backfire... If you don't get the reaction you want (your manager fires Dani, she gets kicked out of Girl Scouts, her friends shun her for being a terrible person) then that will only fuel your rage.

I won't say that screen-shotting the snap story isn't something to consider. Just fully consider the consequences.

Also, find a new job and get better friends. Every time you go to work and see Dani and everyone who sided with her over you you will be reminded of this incident and feel angry all over again. In the long-run it'll be better to put yourself in a better environment and move on."
"Men are larger than women. If you have a weapon or martial arts training or something, by all means, stand up to them. Otherwise, inciting an altercation (or escalating to it) is what we call ""not so smart.""

"&gt; In response to this I started purposely annoying her (I don't really ever get angry but I do respond playfully), she scratched me, and said that she was going to do it again if I kept messing with her.

Yeah, now I'm definitely doubting your original story in which you paint your GF as a abuser who scratched you because she was annoyed with you."
We don't know what the doctor said. We know what OP's husband says the doctor said.
"I called off a wedding. We didn't have much money invested - we had the dress and a few deposits down - but the thing I was most concerned about was embarrassment.

It was the damndest thing. People kept telling me how proud they were of us, how brave we were, to call things off when we knew it wasn't right. 

If you're thinking about calling it off -- call it off. My mom has this thing she does to aid decision making where she asks, five years from now looking back, what would you want to have done?

Five years from now, do you want to be married to this girl, divorcing/divorced from this girl, or have cancelled the wedding? Because from where I'm standing, door #3 looks to be the most attractive choice, even if it's the most painful short term."
"I've said it before, but the reason guys don't ""pick up"" on these hints is because we're constantly told to take things at face value instead of assuming a woman is interested in us. I've read stories on reddit where a female friend strips to their underwear and gets into a bed with their male friend and then get angry and offended when the guy assumed they were down."
"So this FWB situation (not even a proper relationship) was for a few weeks 4 years before you and your partner even met? Honestly I don't know that it is even accurate to call this lying, unless he point blank asked you ""have you ever slept with X?"" and you said ""no"". You're not obligated to disclose your whole sexual and dating history to a partner when you start going out. I don't think you necessarily did anything wrong.

And ironically, if you bring this up now, your partner is likely to see it as a bigger deal than it is/was, because he'll be wondering ""why is she telling me about this now if it was a casual fling for a couple of weeks 11 years ago?! Does she still have feelings for him or something?""

If you really do feel horribly guilty for some reason (which you have no reason to be) and feel like you must tell your partner about this, just downplay it and don't make it into a big serious conversation. 
Say something like:
*""Hey, so now that you're becoming closer friends with X, I wanted to tell you in case it somehow ever came up between you two. 4 years before you and I met, X and I had a casual FWB fling together for a couple of weeks. It was just this random one-off thing, we've never spoken about it since and never seen each other as anything other than friends since then, but I just didn't want it to be weird for you not to know.""*"

Ok, so now you know why your BF acts like a bully and a jerk. So he can get what he wants.

"There was no reading comprehension problem there. That's not what OP was saying up to this point. All her comments were based upon her fiance's opinion of her clothing.

/u/clothes4hoes, looking past your username which gives away your judgmental stance on certain clothes, did your fiance literally say this, or is this your interpretation based on his attraction to these types of clothes and the women who wear them:

&gt; He likes the personality. He claims that every guy wants a woman like that. A wild stay at home party animal.

Has your fiance **done** anything to that shows he doesn't value you, besides having a different taste in clothing/celebrities?

"Why are you having sex with your girlfriend and not actively watching a 4 year old?  Its not like they can entertain or look out for themselves.


I agree with your sisters and mom.  What you did selfish and VERY dangerous.  Him breaking his hand is *your* fault.  Jesus man, do you not see that?"
"Very, very true. Financial issues and incompatibility are a bigger reason for failed marriages than infidelity, so ironing these issues out before getting engaged is very important.


In my case, my husband and I had similar philosophies about for money should be handled (having emergency funds, retirement accounts, etc). However, I was the only one actually living that way before we got together. So part of our decision was that I would handle all aspects of our financial responsibilities - transferring funds into the various accounts, paying our bills *on time* every month, paying credit cards off in full, getting our taxes done - because this is one of my strengths and he was more than happy to turn it over to me. 

Edit: typo"
"No matter where you are, Josh's sister was way out of line and very likely broke some laws and the company policy. This is very serious.

Now, you don't want to carry this pregnancy to term. You will also, over the course of time, phase this family out of your life. You will meet someone else, you will spend more time with him and his family, this is all natural. They will be hurt anyway, because as time goes on, they will become less and less important to you.

Yes, I understand their grief right now. But they have no right to saddle you with their grief for the rest of your life.

If I were you, I would a) take this horrendous breach of your privacy up with the complaints department of Centrelink. Request an appointment and make sure that you are heard fully and b) tell his parents in clear and concise terms that you are not prepared to carry this pregnancy to term (don't use terms like ""baby"", they are emotionally loaded terms and will add to the whole emotional shitfest) and that you and Josh were not planning to have children together.

And I hope they will calm down and see your side of things soon, because this is not something you need to be carrying around, I'm so sorry they are doing this to you."
"Excellent point.  OP, your father has a lifelong inability to handle money. There are no magic words that will wake him up and make him suddenly have good money habits. You can't change him. You can only change yourself. You have a good boundary you have drawn, and you need to stick to it and not let him manipulate and guilt trip you out of it. His threatening to kill himself when you don't give him $$ is beyond the pale. If you need him to stop that, the way to do it is to take it seriously and call the authorities to report him as suicidal (I am not necessarily recommending that, but it is something people have done and it is effective at stopping people from manipulating via shallow suicide threats)."
"Your title is slightly misleading. It should read ""I didn't trust my boyfriend at a bachelor's party, pretended everything was fine the next day, then went through his phone while he was asleep, found something to harden my suspicions, went home, feel guilty for snooping, freaking out because he's not awake yet to answer my texts.""

OP, calm down. What time is it now where you are? How many hours have passed? It is likely he's still asleep, or woke up with the aftermath of a hangover, went to work and simply forgot to text you back because in his mind nothing is a big deal. 

Tonight, have a chat with him about that bachelor's party and whether they actually bailed on ordering escorts or did follow through with it and explain why it makes you uncomfortable. Because this seems to be the root of the issue. "

There is a very specific list of reasons a US Embassy can get involved in a foreign country through international treaty.

Whenever that line comes out, you know it's BS. He doesn't trust you, is really what it is. Because if he did, he'd know that, no matter what you wore, you'd be faithful. 

Anyway, now that he thinks you're hot (apparently, he didn't think it before, or guys would just ignore you like before), you shouldn't wear the stuff you used to. Oh, yeah, that's totally super sweet. He's also insecure and will probably become more since you've gotten hot. I'd be so offended, I would just leave. "

Something needs to change or the bio daughter is going to grow up into a pretty CRAP cold-hearted selfish person. I can totally see her manipulating and conning the mother though so i can at least cut her some slack (A LITTLE - not much). i would never enable such horrid uncompassionate behavior from a child of mine."

I don't think it's wrong to want to travel with your boyfriend. It seems like he hasn't made an effort to include you in his life. Do you two go on trips together at all? 

Personally, I would prefer to be with someone who is on the same page as me in terms of including each other in our lives. Especially after two and a half years. It's not like you guys just met."

Family money should pay for his college too, as much as possible.  If OP's mom had spent it on drugs or gambling I would feel more on the fence but *his money* was spent on OP, wittingly or not. If she wants a relationship with her brother or even if she just wants her brother to know *someone* in that family gives one shit for him, she should make things as right as she can."

Sorry OP,  but you seem like a very lost soul. That you would blame your husband for any of this tells me that you do not know yourself very well at all. This was your creation, your mess, and now you get to fix it. 

Find a therapist. It sounds like you have a lot if discovery ahead of you."
"Interesting that that they are you asking you to forgive him and he hasn't asked for forgiveness or admitted wrongdoing (unless that was left out of your post). Repentance is the first step, if that's a journey you want to take.


Just because you forgive someone doesn't mean you put yourself in a position to let them hurt you again. That's good for thought if you do decide to forgive him. Some pro think forgiving includes letting the offender back in. The two do not go hand and hand. Do what you need to be happy and safe b"
You don't meet with her and shouldn't feel any need to listen to her opinion of you whatsoever. You husband gives her a call and says her opinion of you is irrelevant to him and if she can't keep her it to her self and be civil then future contact will be kept to a bare minimum.

"So this marriage counselor, John Gottman, claims that he can predict whether a couple will divorce with a 93% accuracy based on four behaviors. They are: criticism, contempt, stonewalling, and defensiveness.

I'm seeing at least three of them there?

Criticism: you think with your dick, you're messy, look at that belly

Contempt: you're not a *real* professor, you chose yoga over having a real job, calling your job teaching yoga ""wearing tights""

Defensiveness: if you call her out on it, she has no idea what you're talking about, she changes the subject, she denies it, she hits on you to distract you.

Stonewalling I don't really see described, but this is the sort of thing where you don't really want to go for the hat trick.

Your communication patterns are completely fucked. "
"Perfectly articulated. This post reads like a precursor to all of the horrifying posts that we've read here about women who became trapped with abusive husbands after having a baby and quitting their jobs. I remember one particularly chilling one about a woman who lost her job because her company pushed her out by transferring her to a location a couple hours away because they didn't want to employ a mom. As a result, she lost her health insurance and her husband refused to pay extra to put her on his. He also refused to acknowledge her post party's depression or pay for her to get help. I hope that OP take all of this to heart, uses the diary incident as the wake up call that it is, keeps her job, doesn't get pregnant, and leaves her husband. He's definitely gearing up to escalate his behavior. I'm also concerned that he's going to use the photocopies to blackmail her."
"Exactly this. There's absolutely nothing stopping you and your fiancé, (who bent over backwards by converting to being a Muslim) from going down to your regional provincial or territory office to get married.

Sure it'd be nice to have a wedding surrounded by your family and friends, right now that's not possible given how your parents never want to see your fiancé let alone have a relationship with him.

Nothing wrong with getting an elopement. Your parents were originally going to foot the bill for the wedding. Instead, you and your fiancé can organize a small party surrounded by people who are supportive of you."
"There is nothing wrong with masturbating to porn while in a relationship, as long as both parties agree to it.  She is clearly uncomfortable with it, and has expressed that to you.

&gt;And I've told her that I don't watch porn anymore, which is true other than these couples of times but now she thinks that I've lied to her this whole time.

You did lie to her about it, so she has a right to be upset and to not trust you.

&gt;what am I supposed to do or even say?

Sit down and talk to her about this, and see if you can come to a compromise about masturbating/watching porn.  When you have this talk, definitely don't pose your masturbating as a favor to her (???).  This is for yourself, so don't try to spin it some other way.

If you can't come to a compromise, she's well within her rights to feel that way, and you're well within your rights to break up with her for it.  But don't lie and say you won't watch it when you will."

There was no need to say ""I definitely don't see dating YOU but let me brag about this new guy I am into..."" That's just mean...."

"I assure you, someone higher then that woman, would care. Especially when is a habit of lying and untruthfulness. It reflects 1) poorly on the organization 2.) if something bigger DOES happen- she has a history of bullying and lying- that's a bad mix to trust kids with on weekend get aways, and 3.) She broke their code of conduct. 

If you knew the woman's name- I'd report her too. "
"Lol for real though, how could she possibly turn that into a compromise? ""Ok, you can be in the military for 2 weeks out of the month, then the other two weeks you have to be home with me."" Yeah that's not how it works. You either live the military lifestyle or you don't."
exactly this. how she's 33 and okay with sitting around with a job is beyond me.

Wow I am so incredibly sorry for what you had to go through. that must have been so rough. it's just so hard for me to understand why woman stay with cheating men. Thanks for sharing your story!
"I'm your wife, OP, to some extent. We can afford it a bit more than you, but I've been there. Pretty much exactly. 

Here's the thing. Bring on the downvotes but I'll tell you what works for me. 

I'm only going to get to dress my kids for a few years only before they start picking their own clothes. I love dressing my kids. It is a joy and something I love to do. It's silly and stupid but so much fun for me. It's almost like I can't help myself. Clearly your wife feels the same. 

1. Don't give your wife carte blanche to spend. But. Change your budget around to accommodate the extra spending by making her give up other things. She buys a dress? She has a consequence. She has to give up something else. I gave up coffee, eating out, vacation even. If she continues to spend other things get cut. 

2. Get her into reselling the stuff she buys. A lot can be resold for at least half the cost of buying it. Especially the boutique stuff. There are facebook groups dedicated to this, there is ebay, even etsy if its handmade. This helps a lot. I sell stuff through local sales as well such as just between friends consignment sales. Jbf- look it up. 

3. This may not work for her but it did for me. I learned to sew. And made my own adorable boutique stuff. Seeing now is way different than it used to be. Online patterns from places like youcanmakethis and etsy are like photo tutorials that are so easy to follow. It is so much fun and so rewarding to make exactly what I want. There are tons of beautiful boutique patterns that i could never find in a store. If you want more info on this pm me. 

Good luck!!

"I don't know, the ""we can't, we're trying for a baby"" part made me dismiss innocent interpretation. If friend and her husband are trying for a baby, it means she's not using contraception on her end, possibly even undergoing (prescription, or simply herbal/home remedy) fertility treatments. I interpreted her hesitation to mean that husband wanted to have sex, but friend thought if she gets pregnant there's a risk it could be OP's husband's instead of friend's husband's.

But who knows. Maybe OP's husband was asking for money and OP's friend can't afford it... But then why all the ""I miss you""s?

Only thing for OP to do is confront husband and/or friend, really, and hope they tell the truth. Or, I suppose, she could live in denial about it. That's an option, too."

"So let me get this straight. Your girlfriend has been trying to fit in with your family for years by playing a sport she is openly bad at and doesn't enjoy. You and your brothers respond to this by trash-talking and putting her down for it. Instead of quitting, she keeps trying and playing with you, because she wants to fit in and wants to be involved. This goes on for 4 years. Then more girls come into the mix, and more trash-talking happens, and you start feeling embarrassed of your own girlfriend for not being better at sports, and your solution is to try and make her better rather than suggest other games to play. When your girlfriend gets upset that people are being mean to her, your response is to get exasperated and call her a sore-loser. 

You decide you've had enough and leave her out of a sporting game because she's terrible at it, again instead of suggesting you all play a different game, despite knowing your girlfriend keeps trying very hard to be involved in all this. She is understandably upset by being left out. 

You then ask your brothers to start babying her so she doesn't get upset, which is then met by your brothers calling your girlfriend a cry-baby??? And you didn't defend her and call them out on this remark?? And now your girlfriend is upset again, because now you're singling her out by making everyone baby her for fear of hurting her feelings. Again instead of, you know, trying a new game. 

Honestly?? I'd have dumped you by now. You're an asshole to your girlfriend. All she's done for 4+ years is try to play a game she's well aware she's terrible at and put up with trash talking even though she's upset by it because she wants to be included. And you're calling her a sore-loser and a crybaby. "
"You do know that your 'mistake' or mistake with the pre-nup basically precipitated her wanting to keep her lawyer, right? If she had signed that document, she would have been fucked over royally in the future and her ex caught it. He acted in her best interests. 

From what you write, he's been basically an exemplary lawyer to her - catching onto points of the prenup where she'd be worse off, fighting for a good settlement on her behalf. He isn't paid to be nice to you, he's paid to be a pitbull for her and he's doing the job well. That's a pretty good ex-bf - he's going to bat for her in one of the most important legal documents she'll sign. 

It would be unfair to make her change now. Unless you have a serious professional complaint about him - which you don't say other than something that essentially boils down to 'he's good at his job' - the only thing you can throw up against him is that he was once your gf's ex, and he's now her friend. You don't give evidence that she's cheating, that she's looking elsewhere, you just basically think he's put into her the idea that she has a future that must be cared for and that she needs to think more carefully about this.
