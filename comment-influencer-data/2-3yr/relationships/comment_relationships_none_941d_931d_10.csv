"I thought she was 25

Though from my personal experience, my friends who spent like this at 25 are still spending like this at 31."
"That too, through my childhood. I thought it was ME

I get that too. My brother is autistic, so even when they did focus on us - it was him. Because I could look after myself, I was a good hardworking happy girl. I guess they just thought I had everything I needed, but they just never checked. Thankfully, because of that, I am a very blunt, assertive and honest person. 

I still feel so angry towards my family at times. That's why I wished I had addressed it in my teens. Prevent all that resentment youknow? 

Thankfully my parents weren't narcissistic at all, just ""too busy"" or ""distracted"" by my brother, half siblings/step siblings to notice. 

Just sucks now when I live far away from them all, and I barely talk to them. My dad and I are starting to bond like adults now, over our mutual love of plants. It just makes me sad looking back, because it could have been so different, so much stronger. We should KNOW eachother's favourite plants by now, not just starting to ask. "
"Cat's in the Cradle is a song by Harry Chapin, not Cat Stevens, so I'm not exactly sure if you know the song in question. Regardless, some people may respond to songs like that. "
"Haha no she isn't with me, but my boyfriend actually is. I've already told him he has to sit very far away from me.

I think you're right about the embarrassment being a factor. The dean was clearly agitated, and apologized to me on more than one occasion for Sampson's behavior. "

"Putting it nicely, that level of ""chubby"" is unhealthy. It doesn't matter if you think you look fine at your weight. I understand that BMI isn't always the best unit of measurement. Go to a doctor and find out why you're gaining weight quickly. Check out you body fat percentage. 

You say you've talked to your parents in the past regarding this issue. How did that conversation go, and why are you so opposed to losing weight? "
Yes! I used to work at Nordstrom and they would case shoplifters and add up the value of what they were stealing until they could charge them. 
"&gt; Tell him you like him

Absolutely do not do this."
"Yea I agree, op sometimes it's hard or impossible to see just how bad things really are from the outside. She needs professional help so she can get over this obsession before it escalates to something even crazier. "
Why don't you just talk to him about it? You might be about to ditch a good one because internet strangers are making snap decisions with 10% of the info to go off of. Communicate. 
"Yeah, we really need that red flag sidebar"
"Your mom, the woman who divorced him? Easy for her to say."

"How do you know she's mentally unstable from what little information is presented here? It's normal for women to go through a stage like this, although not everyone does and usually not to this extreme. It hit me hard around 25-28, and I'd buy onesies or baby things here and there. 

I wasn't tampering with birth control or anything, I was just very ready for kids and didn't like the timeline I had to work within. It got better though, and now I just turned 30 and my husband and I are happily pregnant with our first child.

It's also frustrating for women because men don't always understand biological clock issues. It's hard to hear ""just a few more years"" when you're 27 and haven't even started trying yet. A 27 year old woman has 13 years before she's considered to have a high-risk pregnancy by default. That isn't a lot of time if you want several kids and plan on spacing them 2-3 years apart. 

At age 29 I had a heart to heart with my husband and said that I wasn't willing to wait another year or two anymore, since we were both approaching 30 and had stable finances and jobs. I'd been hearing ""just wait, we need this or that first"" for years and was worried about many things, including our kids knowing their grandparents (who are also older than average) and us possibly facing fertility issues that could delay getting pregnant. He finally agreed. 

OP needs to give this girl a solid timeline. That could help ease her concerns dramatically. If she can't work with that then it's her problem, but I totally get where she's coming from. "
"If you are now in a good place financially, would it be possible to put the kids in some before/after school care or daycare so that your husband can start working again? Seems like the move/staying home has had a negative effect on his mental health. Also some family counseling/ individual therapy for himself would be beneficial. How he is treating you is unfair at the very least and could easily be seen as abusive. For this to have any chance at repair, major changes need to happen."
Your marriage is on life support so you need to get some help. He needs to get his shit together because he isn't participating in this marriage. He has withdrawn and left you holding the bag. You can't have children with him at this point. Tell him that you need him to help work on a solution to your marriage because it is in imminent of failing.
"&gt; I spend a lot of free time doing this for him and he won't take any of it on for himself

&gt;I just feel overwhelmed being the only person trying to improve the situation. All he does is come home, complain for almost an hour while I am still taking care of the baby, and then disappear into a video game. I'm lonely and stressed and every time I try to convey that to him, it falls on deaf ears.

That's a whole different problem.

Concerning your original problem. Everyone has crushes. Not everyone has to completely break contact for them. Just make sure there are no intimate moments between you two and you should be fine.

Concerning him not taking any of the burden in the relationship. Well that just sucks and I'd have a real conversation with him about it.

Start by telling him you can't really trust him to be a good stay at home dad if he isn't pulling his weight now.

And yea, if he's whining for an hour call him on it. Tell him you've been helping and he hasn't.

Maybe he has some sort of depression but that's hardly an excuse for everything. "
"The Aunt DOES want to take in his bro part time. ...And then will immediately bail when it's too ""hard"". Any suggestions that he lives with the Aunt just delaying the inevitable: him coming to live with them full time. They can't give an inch on this one."
"When we had our first child, the way my wife got through it was to tell herself that she was a good parent because ""I don't hit my children with hammers, I don't hit my children with hammers......""

My point is, I would hate to be measured as a person by my lowest moment.  It sounds like your spouse kinda snapped when she was pushed past her limits.  She was immediately horrified and is taking steps to make sure it happens again.

I don't think this is abusive behaviour, because she's not getting any benefit from her actions.  She made am immature mistake and she's trying her darndest not to do it again."
"You've made it clear to your social circle that you're more open to dating someone eleven years younger than you than someone your own age- or even five years younger than you.

Given what we typically see as the outcome of huge-age-gap relationships around here, I'd say your friends are probably right in calling that out as pretty creepy. You can *say* it's because they're more attractive to you and imply that you mean physically, but there are plenty of hot 27 year olds, and also even a lot of much younger women with self-confidence would find that kind of age cutoff in your profile a turnoff, so your dramatic cutoff line more than half a decade below your own age suggests to onlookers that your real motivation is that you're screening for inexperience and partners who are open to a major power imbalance in your relationship, which is creep territory."
"&gt; incidents such as ""drove drunk"" (yeah, I know) or ""yelled and upset the baby"".

Your first responsibility is to protect your daughter but you know that. 

Also, it sounds like your husband is the only asshole in this situation. I would say it's ultimatum time - counseling (with positive results!) or divorce."
Sometimes I honestly wonder what goes through people's heads when I read something like this... 
"It sounds like another internalized excuse on OP's side, and I don't think he really knows it.  

There's always going to be another promotion, another blue ribbon to chase.  You can put off marriage and kids for your career forever.  Unless he's got some really solid threshold he wants to reach (tenure, partner, resident, etc), then the timeline is almost arbitrary. "
"it's interesting you compare it to drinking.  ""i wouldn't want to date someone who drinks every day, either.""

okay.  so what would you do if you were dating someone who drank every day?

if you would leave in that case, then you should leave in this one.  it doesn't sound like the issue is the specific drug of choice, but rather, what you view as an *overuse* of said drug.  if that's troublesome to you, then the same rules apply - whether it's pot, booze, cigarettes, pills.

if you would try to find a compromise even in that case, then /u/ennmac's suggestion is as good as any."
"&gt; Although his comments about his friend was rude and uncalled for. 

It sounds immature. That phrasing is the type of thing an immature person would say, a high schooler or teenager, without specifically intending to be insulting in a personal manner. It was unkind and expresses insecurities, but it's also a dismissive statement that demeaned the people in the picture as a way of distancing the boyfriend from them: he was expressing that he is not like them and does not view himself as belonging in their company, he would not dress up like the friend's boyfriend, he does not expect his girlfriend to look like the friend."
"&gt;come over to her house at night, alone, to take pictures of her on her underwear and semi nude, while I'm an hour and a half away working my night shift job. I understand why she couldn't ask if it was okay​(due to it being a surprise)

Uh, you sure that was really just for you for valentines?"
"Yeah this is weird to me to. I'm firmly childfree but if I decided to have children in my life it would be because of adoption. If OP is so afraid of deformities and illness, a baby that's already been born is the way to go. "
This is so fucking cute. 
"Life is so unfair for white people. 

You should start a march or something demanding equal rights and an end to all the racism white people face on a systemic and daily basis. "
"If you're blowing up on her over a question you have bigger problems to be thinking about. It's an honest question and I don't see how that can be construed as rude unless she somehow blatantly hinted that she thought you were being cheap. And if this happened over text which I'm guessing it did, you def need to take a step back and think about your life. You were wrong for blowing up on her, you needed to have asked for clarification and better understanding. Don't be surprised if you're single next Valentine's Day."
"You must be dating my ex. 😡 except he did it with a dead card game that didn't even have a following anymore. He ruined Xmas, vday and my birthday. So I broke up with him after being an idiot for eight months. You need to just call and end it. No point in giving him respect when he has none for you. 

However, I will say that no one is required to celebrate a holiday you like just because you like it. Sure compromises can be made and you weren't asking for much. I think you should date someone who expresses a liking to romantic gestures. "
"I have no idea. He bought it second hand off some guy and it came with some games, then he went out and bought more games I guess."
Chances are she doesnt have the ability to see your point of view because you need a certain level of empathy to understand criticism.

"Is there a way you could re-frame this? I think a lot of people see the term patient as it's term origin - a person who has things done to them. If you could connect seeking medical care as being proactive and him being in charge of his quality of life and longevity it could be helpful - especially as he's only going to need medical attention more consistently as he ages. Maybe a mindset of having goals or objectives for his care could work. This mindset, I think, is important for everyone to have! Prepares us for when we truly need to be our own advocates.

For the immediate future, as a guy who has undergone surgery for inguinal hernia, the reasons why I was quick to schedule my surgery might help get him to the doctor:
1- the hernia hindered my level of activity 
2- it gets worse with time, but is an easy surgery the sooner it is dealt with
3- complications as it gets worse include risk for strangulating/damaging the testicles"
I think it's suspicious. I'm friends with an ex and we talk a lot and I would never delete my texts with him. My boyfriend has my permission to look at them any time he wants to. 
"Do not let this go. She is not listening to you when you tell her the negative connotations that go along with the term, and that it upsets you. No parenting issue is too small to be ignored. "
"How long ago do you think the porn was made? I'm wondering if she had some bad experiences and maybe that's put her off doing any job that includes your body.

Or, she could just be a hypocrite. "
"Oh my god, your story sounds so much like my own life from the ages of about 15-19, except I and my BFF are girls. I was desperately in love with her, and she is straight af. 

Over a decade on (we're both in our early thirties now), we're still good friends, and it's 100% platonic. There were several things that worked to make that happen. 

A little bit of distance: not complete cut-out, but boundaries being put in place, not talking every day, but talking maybe once a week. No more late night MSN conversations. I dated other people, reminding myself that they weren't making me feel that same way immediately because I hadn't known them for anywhere near as long as I'd known her. I allowed myself to fall in love. It happened, surprising even me. 

Eventually, that torch I was carrying went out, and friendship became a hell of a lot less intense and therefore much easier. 

Good luck with navigating this fucked up territory. Whatever you do will hurt like hell for a bit, but you'll emerge from it stronger and happier x"
"This was very rambley.  I got lost a bit, so now I will just ramble.

First off, you arent logical at all.  Does it make logical sense to let all these things about the world get you down and apathetic?  Because you are 'smart' you see the world going to shit, and therefore let it stop you from enjoying the finer things in life?

Do you find being 'right' and seeking 'truth' to be of utmost importance?  Ask yourself why?  What does it benefit you AND or society.

Ill tell you this.  Humans arent logical. At all.  They are emotional.  Logic only manifests by happenstance.  Some humans just ""happen"" to be logical due to how they behave emotionally.

Except the brain has a GREAT way to protect itself. It downplays all that might hurt 'the ego' and it gives more merrit to things that ""uplift it"".  It would rarher be emotional and then rationalize it was logical later.  People who are 'right' all the time are just the most blind to it.  

So you are sitting back and judging the world becomming more and more sour.  Trump is bringing down the country.  Seas are becomming acidic.  God is dead, etc.  Is it logical to waste thoughts on this?

No.  However, it is what you want.  But you feel an echoing in your mind that feeling this was is bad.  Like you are on the wrong path.  Why do you think that is?

"&gt; his is absolutely no defence of what he did, and please, OP, know that his behaviour is not your fault at all
&gt; Perhaps I'm an over-cautious person, but to me this seems like a red flag. He appears to have an anger management problem. He's overreacting enormously to something which, while annoying, is trivial, and displaying violent tendencies.


Go read OP's other submission about her boyfriend and see if you change your mind.... I think she's actually just fucking crazy and paranoid. Her last post was titled ""my boyfriend pushed me,"" and what *actually* happened was she decided her boyfriend was watching their door for his friend's hot girlfriend (according to OP). Instead of mentioning what she thought, OP got angry and withdrew from him. He asked her what was up, and when she told him, he playfully ""shoved"" her shoulder and basically said ""oh, you silly!"" So she made a post titled ""my boyfriend pushed me"" and acted like she truly thinks there is cause for concern."
"Like another commenter said, would you really want someone who would cheat on their SO? If she'll cheat with you, she'll cheat on you. 

Also, is the fact that she's unavailable part of the reason you're into her? Like a forbidden fruit kind of thing?"
"Thank you for framing it this way. Last night during that conversation, I was so appalled because how often do you actually hear someone tell you that it's their right to mistreat you if theres any stress/conflict in their lives, and that it's your *duty* to deal with it? 

It was such a warped perspective that I just couldn't meet it with logic and reason because it is, by its very nature, totally illogical and totally irrational. 

&gt;In the future, if you have to drag a guy, kicking and screaming, through the resolution of an argument, just leave. 

I will heed this advice. Hopefully the next guy I date will have some emotional intelligence and take accountability for his hurtful words and actions. If not, I'll kick him to the curb too."
"I should have clarified this:  I didn't insult her to my coworkers, but occasionally coworkers would ask things like ""Rough night?"" and I'd jokingly respond ""Yea, I'm in the doghouse.""  

The effect of my actions and your point remains the same though, thank you."
"If I baked you a delicious chocolate cake, with the finest ingredients, and the highest-quality chocolate, but the frosting contained 20% human shit, would you eat the cake? Would you say ""Sure, this cake has shit in it, but it has SO MANY good qualities, I guess I'll just eat it..."" OR... would you say ""Heeeellllll no I am not eating that shit cake, I don't care where you imported that chocolate from!"" "
"The person who's acting the most like douche here is you, honestly."
Most shows also have the way it looks and sounds wrong - one of the best I've seen is in the fifth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The episode is 'The Body.'

"Jeeze, just say it. You're married, is it so difficult to say how you feel? "
"Why is that a big deal?  Seriously, do you have kids?"
"I hear you, I can see how that sounds to someone else! The marriage did suffer though. I stand by that. I sort of look at it as it's own entity. 

I guess it helps that I am ten years past it and we're really solid now, I can look at it a little more clinically. Had this conversation taken place 9 years ago I would probably sound much different. "
"So it's okay to invite guests to a party, make them work for free, and leave them hungry?"
"&gt;The OP already stood up for her kids, at the time, when it counted

No, she didn't: She simply pulled the kids away from the situation, and only argued with the wedding coordinator when confronted by that coordinator.

Standing up for her kids means raising and addressing the issue with the Cousin, directly. Making her feelings known--that what happened was unacceptable, and (Edit--&gt;) would not allow that kind of treatment of her daughters in the future."

"It's surprising I had to scroll so far down to find this.  I also think it's very rude for ops husband to ask her to come/Ron to invite her over and then just abandon her and go do their own thing. It almost feels like they're bringing her/inviting her JUST for her to 'babysit' Tammy so they guys can get away and hang out.  I doubt Tammy would be ok with Ron and ops husband hanging out alone without someone else there to hang out with her.   
Op, if they invite you to come over, then just go with the guys when they go off somewhere.  Ask Tammy to come with all of you, if she doesn't want to then that's on her, and you're not excluding or abandoning her.  If the guys have a problem with you coming with, I'd be seriously offended, and I'd probably believe that they really were just inviting me to babysit Tammy for them.  I'd stop going over at all then.  "
In most cases it's a nominal fee. Think $50. You can add this to your suit amount.
This is very culturally ignorant. Why should one year be more special than one month?
"The reason it annoys me when guys say this is because it implies that being a girl is a bad thing, that only men can do fun things and have a good time. To flip it imagine if she said 'oh I forget you're a man because you don't have a beard or lift weights'. "
Why not dump him and go find a guy that is not a felon and an addict?
"No. He's just switching targets he's using her to get at you. 

And even if he wasn't, I'd still take some time away from her. She doesn't sound like she really cares that much about you."
"The period of time that you have known these people is one during which people at your age change dramatically and mature into adults. This can cause people to grow apart, and you may find that you don't enjoy spending time with them anymore.

"That one is a difficult one (KPOP) and the only thing I've drawn a line at since music is so important to me. Sometimes interests are going to be more important than people say. I do think it's interesting that you've yet to meet a woman who likes Dark Souls. I had a man the other day comment on the fact that I'm rare for liking the show Archer. Some of you guys need to talk to more women. 

As for YOUR music, I can guarantee there are girls that have interest in the same type. What is it? Try going to a concert for your favorite artists, or similar concerts in the genre. You might be able to talk to some girls before the show. "

"Talk to her. She feels he is the only one who will understand because he was the only one she had to understand her when her other parent passed away. She feels that the situation is similar and so therefore she needs him to help her. 
Smiley face emojis, I wouldn't read into that until you talk to her. 
Speak with her, she is hurting tremendously. Remind her you are there for her, remind her she is loved, remind her that she has done so well without those harmful habits. 
Empathize with her, hear her. "
"Everyone saying that your future in-laws are ridiculous and that you should not compromise on this are of course right. However, this is a big deal, and you should sit down with Carol and talk to her about it, because otherwise, you'll either lose a friend or a fiancee.

Carol's parents have set her up to be the bad guy - if she chooses them, then you, Mark and Jacob will be resentful of her, and if she chooses Mark and Jacob, her parents might well disown her. I bet she resents her parents for doing this to her, and if you now put pressure on her from the other side, she will resent you as well. She did not ask for any of this - I imagine she just wanted to have a nice wedding. Please keep that in mind when you eventually sit down with her to talk about the situation, because right now you don't really sound like you understand how hard it is to be in that position. You say:

&gt; I feel awful for her because I know it would hurt like hell for her to miss out on being walked down the aisle or having the daddy/daughter dance. But I'm not willing to make that compromise.

However, it sounds like you haven't made any compromises yet - you don't mention a single thing you did to appease her parents even a tiny bit. **I think that's all fine and I don't think you should be catering to their wishes - they frankly sound like terrible, manipulative people.** But from her perspective, she is already upsetting her parents by living with you before the wedding and not having a religious ceremony. She is willing to risk a friendship to appease her parents, and you are telling her no, even though she is the one who will lose her family and you will lose nothing. **Again, this is all her parents' fault and you should absolutely invite Jacob to your wedding.** But think about whether you'd be as quick to decide if it were your parents who were saying this, and how that would make you feel, and keep in mind that growing up in a very Catholic family, Carol probably heard things about blood being thicker than water quite a lot.

So when you do talk to Carol, try not to focus on who is the reasonable person. Talk to her about her parents, and the kind of relationship y'all were planning to have after the wedding and before all of this happened. Like some other posters suggested, talk about what happens if your children grow up gay, and about the control her parents are trying to exercise over her. But if you can't come to an agreement, you should honestly postpone the wedding - if you two are not on the same page regarding things this major, you should not be getting married.

"Did he ever have grief counselling? Maybe you could try to get him to go to that, without mentioning his phone addiction specifically, as he seems very resistant to adressing that.

You're not crazy, he's the one who's worldview is completely distorting what he's hearing from you. When I was particularly low with depression, I was convinced that everyone secretly resented me, wished I wasn't there to be a burden etc. People could say things to me like you did to you husband and I'd be sure they were angry with me, I'd hound them about it and think they were lying when they said they weren't. He's not deliberately twisting your words, but in the state he's in he can't understand what you're really saying.

For me, it came from a place of self hate - I felt like people *should* be angry with me for being so pathetic, so I was convinced they were. I except your husband subconsciously hates the way he's addicted to his phone game, so when you say something innocuous, his mind filters that through his self hate to become criticism. Just don't let yourself be confused by this into thinking that maybe you were wrong all along.

You're probably not going to get anywhere calling him out on twisting your words, because from his point of view that's exactly what he heard, no twisting needed. He'll only become more upset with you and think you're trying to deny what you said. It's something I expect can only be fixed by treating the root cause - his depression. Until then, the best way to respond is just not to engage. Just end the conversation when he acts like this, because there's no way what you're trying to say can actually be conveyed. If someone came up to him and offered him a million pounds when he's in a mood like this, he'd probably think they were looking down on him by implying he can't earn a million pounds himself. If you want to reason with him about his depression, it needs to be when he's in a calmer mood than this."

Bottom line you saying you don't respect someones marriage and hope the marriage fails is not good especially when you disrespected the marriage and actively participated in trying  ruin the marriage. Plus you only heard one side about the marriage which you have been unable to verify and  which I am lothe to believe based on her reaction towards you since her return after christmas vacation.

My suggestion is that you stay away from her and give her the respect and opportunity to work on her relationship with her husband."
"It's probably less to do with them not liking you and more to do with the fact that they don't think their 22 year old son is mature enough to be engaged...which makes them think you are also immature

"He probably doesn't realize the crazy part is not necessary for a relationship. In fact you have been best friends for a long time some marriages don't last that long. The advantage is you have each found your best friend which is important for any long term relationship the fact that you are both sexually compatible is an added bonus. Some best friends don't cross this barrier without some fallout or a decision to part as friends. He seems a bit confused as to how to move forward. The question is can you wait now that your relationship has changed? If so, for how long?"
"It's a little awkward, but I think you can clear it up pretty easily.

Just casually approach it and say, 

""Oh by the way, I was just thinking about this. And Bob's comment caught me a little off guard the other night and I just want to clear things up. I hope you don't think our friendship is a pretext for a crush. You're an amazing person and I value our friendship and have never thought of it as anything otherwise. Bob's just being a tool and reading into things cause he struck out with a girl in class."" 

(Cue chuckle)

Then move on, and don't mention it again or dwell on it. If you act weird or bring it up again, it will look like you're covering up an *actual* crush.

Just go back to normal. 

And let the chips fall where they may."
"I haven't turned down being a bridesmaid, but here are some reasons that I've heard of people dropping out. 

* ""I can't afford the cost of dress/beauty/travel/accomodation/hens night.""

* ""I've got a major project on at work/uni and can't afford the extra time to devote to focus on your wedding.""

* ""I've recently gone through a break-up/a major personal incident and I don't feel emotionally in a position to take on the role of bridesmaid.""

Though OP, seeing as you're not close with this girl any more, there's no reason for you to need a reason. u/TheOpus summed it up right, ""I can't make that commitment"" is enough. "
"People can act like this to their partner when they meet someone else they want to fuck. That may not be it, either way you need to sit her down and talk about the way she's treating you. Does she do this in front of the kid? How old is the child, she may be having regrets like a lot of people do but never talk about.

 If she continues to go out and wont work on your marriage, ask her if what she really wants is a divorce, because that's where that kind of behavior will land you. Good luck, i hope she comes around, remembers her vows and talks to you like a decent human being. "
"There are precisely 0 innocent reasons why a married man would A) be getting drunk with a female coworker and letting her answer his phone, B) having her in his hotel room afterward, C) receiving ""sexy"" pictures from her, and D) lying to his wife about his whereabouts. I find it very telling that he went straight to ""I can't believe you think I'm cheating!"" when all you did was ask him why he had this woman in his hotel room. You didn't accuse him of cheating, but that's the first place his mind went to. He's cheating with this coworker and gaslighting you about it. In his mind, if he makes you feel insecure and crazy enough, you'll distrust your judgement and think ""maybe I am just overreacting"" and stop bringing it up. 

His behavior is disgusting and shameful, but the good thing is you found out early so you can divorce him instead of wasting your life with a lying cheater.  "

"Your sister is jealous of your girlfriends because she had become codependent on you. Does she have her own friends that she spends time woth? If not then I think it's fairly obvious she has got some deep seated issues about how dependent she is on you.

Document every weird thing she does in a note book or a file, find examples of all the texts she's sent to your girlfriends. Once you have all that you can try to present it to your parents as how her behaviour is inappropriate, even if she was being 'protective'. Read up online for some tips about how people document instances of stalking and harassment, because that's kind of what she's doing to you.

And then stop spending time with her. You don't have to explain why to her or your parents, but if you want to tell her that you're not happy about how she has behaved to your girlfriends and how she's hurt your feelings. Tell her you're too upset by her behaviour to spend much time with her, and that her negative actions are affecting how you feel about her.

She will likely whine to your parents, and quite possibly just try to ignore your attempts to avoid her. But be strong and do let them bully you into accepting that her behaviour is normal. It's not, and just because she's otherwise nice doesn't mean she hasn't got a serious issue with her possesiveness over you."
"I don't agree with the way DucksinaManSuit said it, but it seems to me like you're trying to rebuild a house without any blueprint. From the info you've said to us, and if you indeed to have an STI that indicated she had another affair, it seems inevitable that it's not possible for you to have a healthy relationship with her."
"&gt; for the wedding I tried to play both sides to make everyone happy 

There are two people that need to be happy with a wedding - the bride, and the groom. Your mommy shouldn't have had any say, except maybe adding a few people to the guest list if she was helping to pay for it. Even that's a maybe though."
"She said that they're having sex three times a day everyday and more on the weekends, basically the whole weekend, and that it's long sessions each time that she wouldn't mind if they weren't having sex all the time. I have a high libido (female) and I STILL wouldn't have time for that much sex"
I literally have a shrine built to my divacup. (Which I could afford to do with all the money I'm not spending on pads/tampons anymore.)
"You don't have to blow them off because of her. Let her get upset.  She's not being a very good friend to you to manipulate you through tantrums to not have a social life outside of her, that is completely selfish and not healthy in the least. 

Don't let her drag you down. 

This is a boundary you have to set. One ""talking to"" isn't going to cut it, you are going to have to behave differently, and be consistent. Be open to new friends and love interests, and still be her friend. 

If she wants to give you the super childish and unhealthy silent treatment, oh well. Hopefully she can read some self-help books during that time. Give zero fucks about her tantrums and silent treatments. 

You are young, you are supposed to be meeting people for friends, potential romantic partners, and future networking.  Don't let her stop you from doing that. "
"No more dating for you until you're 25! Go get a hobby or something. Learn a skill. Go on a holiday. Learn to be by yourself. Love your own company. 

The rest will follow."
"Agreed! I also dated a year for a year. We broke up a couple weeks ago. Neither one of us ever said we loved each other because of our egos and fear of rejection. We broke up on ok terms, but I never told him I loved him and I wish I would have because I feel it would have given me closure."
"I can kind of see your girlfriend's point of view. Clearly she found the cohabitation agreement signed with your mom and a lawyer humiliating. I also don't see why it was necessary -- couldn't you just have filled out the deed in your name only? Or else made a written agreement between the two of you that you agreed was binding, but which you didn't share with your mother? I wouldn't want relationship details spelled out in public either, personally.

The milk has been spilled, though. I am not sure why seeing that your girlfriend can be angry is such a deal=breaker -- sounds like she had some understandable reasons -- but it does sound like this relationship has been put under so much stress that it can't really survive in the same form it's had before. Sounds like you need a break or a break-up. 

Let her know as soon as possible so she can plan her next housing step -- that would be the respectful thing to do. Especially since she's just been dangerously sick, don't let her be afraid she might not have a roof over her head soon. Someone who's recovered from a major illness does not need that kind of stress."
I always liked Fetal Nutritional Substrate myself
"I think you need to break up with her at the very least.

I'm wondering what's going to happen with your teeth. That's forever shit, and dental work isn't cheap. You're going to not have teeth for a while and you're going to be working your ass off to pay for getting yourself fixed up.

Has your SO brought that up? Sure she's apologised and she's sorry now. Is she still going to be sorry a year from now when your teeth are still a problem or is she going to get aggressive *again* because you won't let go of the permanent physical problem she caused for you.

Do you even know why she was spoiling for a fight with you? Not that the answer matters, but WTF? 

If the genders were reversed I'd tell a girl to dump the guy and tell the police what actually happened. So that's exactly what I'm telling you to do.

I'm glad you told your dad what really happened. End the relationship. Let him help you."
"A lot of the top comments are rather confrontational... Let me give you a mans perspective:

Work feelings are a thing. To me, it's cause for concern when your partner starts to talk a lot about a certain person whilst simultaneously becoming increasingly distant from you because it's a sign that they are developing some.

The thing is, when you're at work and you're interacting with a member of the opposite sex who you *would* be interested in, you only ever see the **good** side of that person... Then you go home to kids, bills, any problems raised by your husband/wife and your mind just floats back to work and how you're happier around that person you *only ever see the good from*. The longer it goes on, the less time the person will care about/pay attention to their own relationship because naturally... We gravitate to whatever makes us feel happy, right? Problem is, the grass isn't always greener... Your work crush will come with all of the same style of problems you have at home, you just don't get to see them until you've fucked up your own relationship for it. 

If I were you, I'd raise this issue in a **sensitive** and **sympathetic** way. Don't attack him by being all like ""you never spend time with me anymore, it's always about her"" because this is just going to reinforce his feelings of ""home = sad/dull &amp; work girl = happy/refreshing"". I'd approach it like ""hey, I've noticed you're much happier and that makes me really happy... I just feel like we could spend some more time together, just the two of us, hey about about we go here or do this"" etc. This is much better than EXPECTING flowers/dates or NAGGING him to take you somewhere just because he's ""supposed to"" -- that's probably one of the things pushing him away from you and more towards her. Avoid statements that start with ""you"" and use more suggestive ""we"" language."
"Tell her to chill. He's a kid and had a wardrobe malfunction, it happens. "
"I do have contact with him. We aren't close, but are friends on fb. "
"&gt; clearly I do.

No you don't. ""No"" is a complete sentence."
"Dude that's awesome. I teared up reading this.

Don't feel guilty they did this. Guilt implies you did something wrong, and you didn't. You just have amazing people around you who love you. So don't feel guilty, feel grateful! And keep working hard and giving back to them to show your appreciation. 

Also, I think you should say thank you to each of them in person, and be as sincere as you can. A sincere thank you even if (especially if) it's emotional on your part will mean the world to them."
"I've decided to write her a letter.  I've already slept through this issue, and I am still upset. I don't think I can talk to her yet without going all emo and betrayed, so I will hand her a letter...and then go out and drink."
"Trying to look at this from his perspective, I'm thinking that going over to your house to eat a special cultural dish that your dad makes isn't exactly... a private romantic event? I bet he (rightfully!) thought the card was cute and appropriate to give his 17 year old GF in front of her family. I don't think it's right to critisize him harshly here, maybe just suggest you want to do something more adult next year or spend other special occasions focusing on each other. 

As for the gift...
Make a wishlist on Pinterest or Amazon: if he is like my husband and wants to give great gifts but isn't all that creative he will appreciate the suggestions. His gift wasn't objectively bad, just not particularly thoughtful."
"Yeah, go ahead and break up with him. And then good luck finding a guy who only finds you attractive - spoiler alert: *they don't exist*.

Look, he finds other women attractive. This means the attractive-recognition part of his brain^(may not be an exact scientific term) will still recognize *you* as attractive. Would you rather it be turned off and he not find any women attractive, including you?"

"I don't really have a good answer. All I can say is I was under a lot of stress, felt hurt by her, and made a rash decision. 

edit: Fair, I made a shitty decision. But I'm confused why she's so hurt by losing this opportunity, when she didn't seem to value it in the first place?"
"I think that's selling both men and women short. Women are not born knowing when and how to shop for gifts. We're taught to pay attention to people. Men are given a pass because, well, it's the women's job to shop for gifts! But that's bullshit. Men can absolutely be great at holidays, they just have to care and make the effort to be better. "

Great idea and totally worth the money. 
"Wow, I feel bad for this guy."
"I completely agree that how she handled Harry, especially in the beginning, was wrong.  She clearly wasn't over her ex, she was stoking the fires by talking to him, and she never should've started up with Mike in the first place.

But Mike's not a hapless victim, either.  He stuck around in the relationship, even as his self-esteem was getting battered.  Instead of dumping OP within the first few months of dating, he invested years and even proposed marriage!

If there's a lesson to be learned from this situation, it's that in order to save a relationship, you sometimes need to be willing to end it.  If Mike had said, ""Let's break up and you can call me when you're over Harry"", I think he would've had a lot more respect for himself, and consequently, OP might've seen him as a prize she needed to earn, not as a Plan B."

"I'm thinking it may have just been a big emotional swing in that moment. He was excited about packing her up so they could start a new chapter of their lives together &amp; he stumbled across all the mementos from her past relationship. He may not have ever really processed that she was previously engaged until he saw that. 

For the record, I still think he is handling it pretty poorly. But I feel like he still has a shot at redeeming himself if he calms down, recognizes that's he had a very emotionally charged reaction &amp; apologizes for how he acted. It's a one time issue that's not going to arise again, unless there's another box somewhere. "

&gt;  And I don't even hint at attraction to her sister. Etc.

WTH? Do you want a reward for that? How pathetic? You're a selfish jerk who just wants to have his cake and eat it too. Just break it off and live with the consequences.

"The lack of responsibility you take here is really jarring.

You were not kidnapped in a burlap sack and tricked into this situation. You chose this. You started seeing each other - that decision was mutual. You guys moved in together - that decision was mutual. You moved to a new place together - that decision was mutual. You were not tricked into any of these situations. You are here by choice.

You have led this woman on like crazy. You're not a kid - you're a 30 year old man. You've been wasting her time and it sounds like you've just been using her. It's not an equal relationship, and she does far more for you than you do for her, by your own description. You can't say no - partially because you enjoy all the benefits of the relationship. 

In your next relationship, take responsibility for your actions. Do not just slide into commitment and waste people's time. It's actually really cruel for you to do that. "

""Don't you think we'd be irresponsible to marry before I finish college?""

"&gt;  But, I texted her yesterday morning to see if she could talk &amp; she said yes. It was so weird hearing her voice

That was your first mistake. 

&gt; I asked her how we proceed

That was your second. 

The correct move would be to delete her number and all forms of communication. If she contacts you, the correct move is to say, ""Sorry. I would rather be with someone who acts like a goddamn adult. Fuck off.""

Oh, and

&gt; I think if we figure ourselves out maybe someday we could get together and talk about being in a relationship again"". I guess I don't really know what that means.

It means that she's keeping you on a line so that she can go out and ""explore"" other guys for a while with no guilt and if she finds them all wanting, she knows that you'll take her back. 

Dude. This person is awful. "
"There are things that he is into, that I am not into. But I support him and go with him to the things he likes, even though it's not my favorite thing.

I feel like I am putting in a lot of effort. "
"Totally agree. 

The friend sounds super anal-retentive, which would be annoying, but he's also not getting a ton of help from the friends who he's planning this for.

OP: 
Are the suggestions people offer constructive?  Do they say ""That sounds great, but if we lolly gag or want to take pictures along the way, maybe we should plan for dinner to be an hour later.""  Or do they just say ""Your schedule should lighten up,"" and not offer anything else?

I get it; it's a personality clash.  But this is his dream trip.  

I'm not as organized or detailed as your friend, but I do hate when my friends get all fired up about joining in on something and then either can't make a decision among themselves or just spin their wheels or keep shooting down ideas without contributing anything.

Go back to your friend and try to have a more productive conversation.  Start out by apologizing, but don't shy away from eventually pointing how childish he was being.  Come up with some helpful ideas, collaborate like adults, and make sure everyone is ready to pay him for the AirBnBs (or put it on your own card if you don't care when people pay - why does he have to do it?)."

"To be honest, you can't help her. Since that was your question, that is my answer. To elaborate a bit, at this point in Marcy's life, she will have to figure it out on her own, if she ever does.

"""However, I had suffered from temper issues for many years. When Anne missed one of our dates, I got mad at her and made her cry.

Bullshit.  Sorry, I love my husband with more intensity than anyone I've ever been with, and I've certainly never been manipulative and controlling, nor yelled at him or threatened him, nor has he with me.

You were abusive to your ex.  You were an abuser.  That is why she left you.  The fact that you are unable to admit this really sets off some red flags for me.  It doesn't sound like you've admitted it to yourself.  You're trying to justify it.  ""I couldn't help it, I just loved her so much"".  That isn't love, sorry.

Break it off with the poor new girl.  Don't tell her why.  Then go fix yourself, and admit that you treated your poor ex horribly, to the point that she left you *because she was afraid of you*."
"Right - but unless they get a housekeeper who's there all the time that he's home, following him around with a dustpan or whatever, there's still a problem.

Washing food off your dirty dishes and popping them into the dishwasher. Putting your clothes in a hamper. Replacing the toilet paper when you've finished a roll. Etc."

"I think you also need to recognise the enormous pressure that is placed on women to see togetherness and attentiveness (and yeah, gifts) on Valentine's Day as a symbol of how much your partner cares about you. There's a very strong expectation that if your relationship is going well, you should enjoy spending time with each other even if you know the day is a bit arbitrary and silly. And because men are often not very affectionate or attentive to their partners in non-sexual ways the rest of the year, this is the chance you get to express to your partner that you care about them for more than their body, and stuff.

Please also practice not using the intellectually lazy ""women [are biologically wired to] think differently from men"" as this often doesn't stem from actual sexual dimorphism in our species but from socially constructed gender roles which change across time and space."
"You did give her a deadline.  You asked her for the first months rent and she declined to give you the rent.  **END OF STORY**

Since you were considering other options you left me no choice but to do the same, and I found a better option.  Your own inaction is the reason you lost this house.  Look at it this way, if this didn't go well, then probably sharing a house wouldn't have gone well either so we should consider this a good thing."""

I love the irony of those arguing that its not big deal if this guy is loosely associated to OP (ie your social network is not that big of a deal) - but are all up in arms cuz OP de-friended her family (de-friending is the worst!).

which is it?  you can't have it both ways!"
"Not to defend Sarah or her weird military ex-beau, but OP's gf wanted him to come along. If this was just a work party that she wasn't attending with Sarah, would he go? Coupled with the fact that he didn't want to go to be a part of Sarah's antics (which, of course, is totally fair), he couldn't have gone to make sure she was safe? He knew that the both of them were trouble and he couldn't be bothered to go along with her because he wasn't looking out for her - he was looking out for him."
"Dude, it's one person who used to have feelings for her. Still may. It doesn't sound like he's being controlling.
IMO, the other poster is right. It's less about the guy himself and more about the fact that OP doesn't seem to give a crap about her BFs feelings. Obviously something about this guy is making him uncomfortable:

She needs to do something to assuage those concerns, rather than just dismissing them. 

Her dismissing BFs concerns repeatedly just makes it obvious that she doesn't really care that much. And frankly, in this thread, looking at her replies, it seems that she only wants validation to ignore his feelings on the matter, rather than an actual opinion. "
"I wonder if over time OP can also talk about new friends or study buddies and just mention them here and there. 

We don't know why the lady is acting this way so we wouldn't want her to feel rejected or anything. But hopefully she'll understand that you're making friends your age. I'd probably make up some random study buddies actually.  

""Oh sorry I've already planned a study session with [Kathy] and [Johnny]"" 

""[Kathy's] family is from [OP's home place] as well, and we're the same age,"" etc etc. "
There are asexual people of all genders.
"&gt; threatened to file a restraining order against me (good). I think that was Wednesday. 

Please take that threat seriously. Depending on your state, in some states almost anyone who asks for a restraining order will get a temporary one, immediately, just by asking. The temporary one will be in effect until there can be a judicial hearing, where he will need to come up with some form of an actual reason and evidence for needing one. But UNTIL that, with a temporary restraining order, you would be kicked out of the residence. You wouldn't be able to contact him or even come within a certain distance of him. You could actually be removed from the home by the sheriff and not be able to access any of your possessions there until after the hearing.

It could cause a real shitstorm on your life. Honestly, I really, really recommend that you stay in a hotel until he's moved out, since he made this threat. Or, at the very least, just start recording all of your interactions with him. "
"As someone who suffered with secondary infertility as well, THANK YOU. Fertility treatments are WAY fucking cheaper than adopting an infant, and exponentially more so than adopting an infant at low-risk for being reunited with family. 
And foster-to-adopt? I worked in the foster care system, and that will absolutely wreck you emotionally if you're not ready for the whole multi-year process. 
I seriously get so sick of the ""just adopt!"" like you walk into an agency and pick a healthy baby for $50 like you do a dog from the shelter. Fuck."
"Ugh, everything about your husband and his friend are repulsive. That poor girl being persuaded into an unwanted abortion! She is going to feel that pain for a very long time. 


As for your husband, how disgusting. I certainly could never be in a relationship with a person with these views."
"Insecurities. 

You celebrate that he got a job = conformation that he was right all along, and that you were low key judging him as man and as a husband. 

Not touching = he doesn't feel like he DESERVES that kind of closeness, because in his mind he is not bringing anything to the table. 

The longer he's shitty about things and you being nice about it, the worse he feels about himself. And harder it is for him to go back to the person he was. 

I don't have solutions, and I don't believe in telling people to leave or stay. 

You know him best, fight for the relationship, let it continue as it is, or leave. 

Just know when you need to quit. "
"Thank you. Saying no has been something I've struggled with out of fear of ""being mean"". I've had to put my foot down but I've always caved and resumed contact. Reading all these comments has given me a lot more courage to be strong and cut my ties with her."

"*Verbal Abuse Signs*

Do they...

make derogatory comments about a group you belong to (gender, career, religion, etc.)? This comment might end with ""I mean them, not you.""

make fun of or insult your ideas, behaviors, or beliefs?

make negative comments about people, places or things that you love?

say things that are almost true about you, but leave you wanting to defend yourself?

say, ""What? It was just a joke!"" to dismiss a remark that offends you?

ask you questions about something that just happened and reply to your answers, ""Do you care to think about that and answer the question again?"" or just sit there, staring at you, in a way that lets you know your answer wasn't ""right""?

engage you in long conversations about things on which you disagree until you reach the point of wanting to say, ""Okay. Whatever. You're right!"" Or insist that you repeat what they said and then, later, claim, ""You agreed with me (then)!""

somehow manage to physically back you into a corner or somewhere you cannot easily escape during intense conversations?



Verbal Abuse Symptoms
Do you feel...

nervous when approaching them with certain topics?

insulted because of their use of foul language, or does their use of foul language change the meaning of otherwise normal requests? (Such as, ""Could you f*ck*ng tell me how much f*ck*ng longer it will be before you're ready for dinner?"")

a need to ""tell on yourself"" about innocent events in case the person hears about it later?

misunderstood for the most part in your relationship?



These questions relating to verbal abuse signs and verbal abuse symptoms describe how verbal abuse sneaks inside the framework of your relationship and poisons your thoughts with confusion and doubt."
Because he was trying to be a loyal friend. 
"I think you should mention that it makes you uncomfortable, but I completely disagree that it's a sign that he wants to be with his ex. I think it's a positive that he got attached to her child, and I think it's ok (and not a reflection of any deficiency in his relationship with you) that he still values her pictures."
It sounds like you're jealous of a little girl. It's incredibly sweet that he still has those pictures up there that she made for him. He might not see her anymore but that's still a really special thing and I don't know why you would want to take that away from him.
"Stab you in the back?

Son, it had nothing to do with you. You weren't part of the equation, nor should you have been. She didn't stab you in the back by going on with her life as she pleased. She was just living her life.

Make more friends.  Pick up a hobby that puts you around people, start going to the gym, talk to new folks. You can't hang all your need for interaction on two people."
"There are a few problems going on here.

One is the dog is a puppy. Puppies are terrible, and I'm a dog lover, they chew, poop, jump, whine, cry, and destroy things. It's what they do. She seems to be taking the right steps in getting her puppy trained, exercising it, and cleaning up the messes its making. This is a phase puppy owners just have to get through, like the terrible twos and parents. Once the dog is older and better trained many of these issues should be much less severe.

You also have the problem of trying to save a relationship by getting a dog/cat or having a baby. It never works. All the issues you had before are still there and now +puppy. Your girlfriend doesn't want to live in your house. She doesn't want to live with you and your brother and sister, the rabbit, and the cat. This issue needs to be resolved somehow that works for both of you. 

She moves out until your family leaves. You have your family leave. You all move to a bigger house. You give your siblings your house and you and GF move into somewhere else. Something. 

GF has the issue of need to put dogs life and first. If she can not provide a good, safe, healthy home for the pup the pup needs to go to another home. 

And finally you have the problem of she loves dogs and is going to to want and have dogs for many years and you don't really want them. I would say that just because this puppy isn't fitting into your life right now doesn't mean no dog could ever fit in nicely. It might be possible. But you two need a talk ASAP about you pet compatibility. Or it will continue to be a wedge."
"Probably because they agreed not to see other people, and fucking other people counts as seeing other people."
"Okay - a few things. Don't feel bad. You stumbled on the fb messages, and it naturally worried you. Anyone in your position would snoop a little - totally natural. It's not like you're tearing apart your house looking for something lol.

Next, being a total stranger and outsider to this I do believe you are overthinking this a little bit. I don't get the vibe she's physically cheating on you - I think the messages you saw on her phone originally were all that was there. Also, if she had to keep pushing the conversation with him, then it most likely means he isn't interested in her romantically - so no emotional cheating. 

However, I do believe she has a crush on this co worker. And crushes must ALWAYS be nipped in the bud. Which means spending as little time as possible with the crush. 

You should confront her about her lying. Be honest (one of you has to be after all lol) and tell her that you stumbled on the fb messages and you have a right to know what is going on as her husband and father of her child. Don't shout and scare her off; just sit her down and be patient.  "
"An addiction never goes away. When I was much younger, 18-20 (I'm 39 now) I had a problem with pills. RX painkillers. Started innocently enough with a legitimate prescription.

I was absolutely, 100% an addict. I was abusing them. Thankfully I wasnt so far into the addict ""lifestyle"" that I couldn't turn back, and quit for the most part on my own with the help of a friend. I was addicted for about 3 years, functional the entire time.

Even now as I type this, my brain is still lying to me. I'm remembering how good I felt and how productive I was when I was using. How I was more laid back and nicer to be around. That's all probably bullshit. That's addiction lying to me. If you offered me ""just one pill for old times"" right now, I can't promise you I wouldn't take it. 20 years later, I want it. I'll always want it.

Thankfully I had only one VERY brief relapse. I've been lucky. Many people are less so.

I can even use RX narcotics now, when I truly need them. But my BF has to hold the bottle. And I have to commit to promising myself there won't be just one more week, one more refill, one more pill, it still hurts ""a little"". I have to do that with no wiggle room. 

Once you have had an addiction, once that pathway is forged in your neurotransmitters, it will never, ever leave you."
"Same here. In pondering this, I remembered Kathy had labeled OP as office idiot, and I immediately wondered if Kathy is deliberately using ""idiot"" as a pejorative in reference to OP's high-functioning autism. :("

"Chances are good that someday she will. Most women do manage to leave abusive relationships. It's just gonna take some maturing on her part. 

In the meantime...god I know how hard it is, but *drop it.* Your sister knows perfectly well how you feel about this asshole and she is choosing to be with him anyway. Nothing you say will snap her out of it. And the more you shit-talk him, the more she'll be convinced that you don't understand her and he's the only one who gets it. It's called traumatic bonding, and it is in full force here. You'll lose every time.

Continue to see her, without him, and talk about anything else. If she complains about him, you can offer sympathy, but *no advice or pressure.* You can also put a moratorium on the subject if you simply can't stand to listen to it anymore. But keep the life raft in the water for when she's ready to bail. You don't want her to fear an ""I told you so"" so much that she won't call on you for help when she really needs it."

"...whats wrong with you? She's going through one of the hardest times I'm sure she'll ever have to deal with and supporting her grandma, and youre worried about you?

Sweet baby Jesus. I'm trying really hard to understand this post. Straining for you? Just be a good boyfriend. This isn't about you! When you love someone you support them through the hard times! Life can't always allow 5 happy visits a week. Help her, surprise her with pizza, hang out with her and grandma, be there for her! Help take the stress off her shoulders. 

Hard times can bring you closer than you ever imagined if you stop being selfish and crying ""but what about me? :("""
"That's a moot point. He does have a child with his ex. So, he's really not doing anything out of line. OP just seems to be hypersensitive to her SO having any friendly contact with his ex. Which, really isn't *his* issue. It's hers to work on should she want to continue the relationship. The baby momma isn't going anywhere. That's just a fact. "
"&gt; but what am i missing Reddit?

The willpower to leave this guy for GOOD and give yourself all the self-care and self-work you need. I know it's hard because you have been with him for 4 years, but it's better to leave now at 25 than at 26, or at 29, or at 35. Sometimes, relationships can be salvaged, but in this case you've already given him a chance after getting back together, and it is not working out.

He's addicted to porn, his computer, doesn't want to go out and socialize, has been addicted to Adderall, lied to you many times, blames his circumstances rather than his behaviors, and you're missing the intimacy and trust you crave and **need**.

You deserve to be with someone you can trust, who can handle his own business, who doesn't have a highly addictive personality, who gives you the respect and love you need, and to whom you can also give respect and love. There are so, so many people in this world who can be that person for you, but you'll never find them unless you leave."
"&gt;That's what I would have said two weeks ago, though.

And this. Yeah he should've taken the hint by now, but then again he's unstable and hasn't had a date in over TEN YEARS.

""It was lovely to meet you but I don't feel we are a match. Take care."" or similar in response to the first message. Then you can block / ignore safe in the knowledge you've made it clear you're not interested. There really is no need to leave people confused about what's going on."

Please explain to me why the friend would pay even though he declines to come?
Sadly she's working so hard with this (I think) because she just wants me to be happy -  she wants me to have the perfect wedding day surrounded by everyone in the family. So she's working to force everyone to be on their best behavior for the wedding. But we can't just pretend he's okay for one day during the wedding and I don't want to work with my aunt and uncle to make this work just for one wedding day. I need to tell her this can't work. Seeing everyones comments makes it so obvious now. 
"I don't know if them being disappointed that their son got engaged at a young age means that there's a problem necessarily. One of my best friends got married at 23 to his college girlfriend and at the wedding reception, his parents, who got married in a shotgun wedding situation at 16/17, were supportive but made comments to me and my parents that they were happy for him and loved his fiance, but they also wished he hadn't gotten married yet because they knew how hard it was to have a family when you aren't established and they wanted better for him than what they had. Five years later, the situation all worked out fine as far as I can tell. "

"I expect downvotes but this really gets me. yes, it's expensive, yes, a lot of kids who are available for adoption have their own set of issues, and that's understandable if you wouldn't want to adopt one. but I mean... what if you can't get pregnant? while I know it's my personal opinion that it should be considered, I think you should actually at least have a serious discussion about this. If you're both 100% sure you won't adopt if you won't get pregnant that's fine, but with a kid that already exists, you are going to have more of a known quantity of their issues (obviously not EVERYTHING). Even if you internationally adopt or something, whatever. Just worth a discussion before writing off. I wish you the best. "
"What about a compromise where you decrease the number of couple activities and the guys increase their guys nights? For instance, maybe you could do one couples get-together per month and then Ron and your fiancé could also do a couple of guys nights per month. And on the guys nights you could do your own thing with other friends. Even if you never develop a good rapport with Tammy, you could probably handle making nice with her once a month for the sake of your relationships with Ron and your husband. Sometimes you just have to tolerate the annoying SO's of people in your friends group. "

"&gt; I don't see anything wrong with going through each other's phones while in a relationship.

I think that is a valid position, if it works for you. BUT the reason everyone is tearing you a new ass over this is that it is absolutely not the default expectation in any interpersonal relationship. The assumption of society is that my stuff is private *unless explicitly I say otherwise*"
"It's pretty clear she told you this just to hurt you.  There is absolutely no benefit to telling you this otherwise. From her point of view, how else could she have possibly thought that information would effect you?  Displaying shitty character is a good enough reason to stop being her friend completely if you ask me."
"I'm going to give a different perspective. You're young, you probably won't marry this girl anyway. So imagine this relationship goes on for a year or two, and you grow apart. im not going to say it's time wasted, but there's plenty of fish in the sea, why not find someone just as loving and caring who has a similar schedule to yours? It may not be a popular opinion and I'll probably get shit for it, but breaking up now is a viable option"
"You can shut down those 'jokes'. As long as you do it professionally, like ""That was inappropriate"" or ""Please stop"". You don't have to bottle it all up inside."
"I'm gonna go against the grain here with a couple of observations. First, it doesn't sound like you have tried particularly hard to be their friends either because you say you are quiet. So are you friends with them? Second, weddings are expensive but one person isn't going to throw the whole budget-- are you sure that she wasn't talking about other guys outside of the wedding party? Perhaps it felt like it was directed only at you in that setting, but is there a chance that it was a broader statement about the size of their guest list? And finally, if you haven't made friends with anyone from this group, are you going to have fun at a wedding where your boyfriend is busy most of the time at least until the reception? Will you talk and mingle and have fun or will you sit awkwardly by yourself? 

If you want an invitation or plan to go to the wedding, I think you should consider putting yourself out there more and endeavoring to connect more with these girls. It'll make things easier on your boyfriend as well. "

Seriously. This is a stupid fight, OP. I would be starting to question whether I want to throw the flowers at you if you blew up at me for asking a simple question like this. Stop being offended and just fucking talk to her."
Only if he was making his own money and after all his bills were paid. Spending student loan money on it and then having to be bailed out by your parents is irresponsible and shameful. 
He sounds like a jerk. You don't have to cater to his whims and emotions and you're not a child who has to notify ppl that you're going to bed. Don't settle just because this is your first relationship.
His horrible body? Perhaps. Others seem to think it has to do with her colleagues knowing his embarrassing phobia. IDK. Once again seems fairly irrational for someone who should have an understanding of doctor-patient confidentiality.
"But if you don't start trying until your mid-30s, and she's a year older than you, then you might not have time to have more than one kid before her fertility declines/risks increase around 40.  Getting (and staying) pregnant can take a long time.  I'm 35 and pregnant with my first, but we started trying almost 2 years ago and had 3 losses along the way.

"What you're really afraid of is that your wife will realize what you've done to her for two years is controlling and abusive, and she'll leave and you'll be without your bang-maid.

Tons of men would be thrilled that their wives were coming out of their shells. Tons of men would hate the fact that their wives grew up in an abusive environment and would fight the fucking devil himself to help her get better. Tons of men would want the woman they loved to thrive.

I'll bet you saw how broken she was from growing up like that and decided you'd save her. You're not saving her. And don't be surprised when (not if) her depression worsens from being married to you. Don't be surprised when she gains the strength to leave, one way or another."

"I think it's inappropriate to fight for an inheritance that you aren't owed, but I also don't think you should fund your mother and lazy brother who can get their own jobs.  So I'd cut off the $12,000/year, and start saving that for OP's own future, knowing she's on her own."
You say you can afford a house if you save prudently. Your parents gave a house to your brother because he's a mess and can't get his life together. Just take the money your family is mooching off of you to support your lazy brother and buy a house for yourself. Your brother doesn't need it - he's got a house so he must be doing well for himself. (/s)
"Yes, in theory more consistency = fewer tantrums.

But in practice, more discipline = more tantrums NOW. And if you child is truly violent during tantrums, so much so that other FAMILY MEMBERS aren't willing to watch him, then your SIL is probably unwilling to subject herself to those tantrums in the hopes that they'll stop. 

I think you need to acknowledge that you're asking a lot of your SIL. Watching a kid one night a week could be a fun bonding activity for aunt and nephew. Watching a kid 2-3 times a week moves into work/obligation territory. And then on top of that you're asking her to provide discipline to that kid that will, at least in the immediate future, subject her to unpredictable and violent tantrums. You are really asking her to go above and beyond what most people would do for family, especially if she's doing it for free or substantially less than ""market value"" for a sitter.

You seem focused here on ""how to gently reprimand her and get her to do more of the heavy lifting with our son,"" but I think a more appropriate thing to do would be reevaluate your arrangement and her comfort with certain things. I can't fault her for avoiding tantrums, if that's what she's doing. It is possible that she would no longer be willing to keep watching him on such a regular basis if she would be forced to confront them head on, and in that case you would need to be thinking of a Plan B, or deciding which is the lesser of two evils (i.e. having auntie not on board with discipline OR having to rearrange finances/schedules so that a replacement who IS willing to do things how you want them done can be found)."

Even if he has to tell her ""I love how smart you are, but please dumb it down for everyone else because they aren't on your level and don't understand you my love"" Because now after reading this comment I firmly believe that him encouraging it exasperated the problem."
Lol which one of them is being pathetic now?
"She called him manipulative and said that she can't step foot in his workplace again. What in that seems promising for the future? He even told her that she was over reacting and emotional. 

Op is not a keeper, I don't think anyone would be rushing to be with a guy so weak in character that he'd rather destroy his partners reputation than engage in normal social boundaries. It would just make him seem more pathetic if he even tried."
If he's that worried about you then maybe he should go with you. 
He's not being too overprotective.
"Lady, you got ""mean"" responses because you're being completely unreasonable. Just like the breaking up itself, it's not the answer you want, it's the answer you *need*. 

You *need* to let this go. You *need* to leave your ex boyfriend alone. You think stalking him and being this vindictive over it is gonna make him want to continue being in a relationship with you? Leave the poor kid alone. He wants to end the relationship, for what we clearly see are perfect reasons. You don't have to accept these reasons. He doesn't owe you a thing.

Leave. Him. Alone. 

EDIT: Also changing his age to try and make this sound ""better"" isn't gonna work. You're still being incredibly selfish and stalkish regardless of age or specific details."
"This is actually good news. This is your opportunity to move on from a woman you can never be with and get some space and independence from your brother / father figure who is far more dominating, manipulative and cruel than you seem to recognize.

Take a page from Luna's book and throw yourself into work and hobbies. Travel. Date. Develop yourself and your own life. You've been using this painful holding pattern drama shitshow in which you're largely irrelevant to avoid your own life for too long."
"OP's the one who said his head's fucked, not me.

But think about it from the woman's perspective for a second: she's in a long-term, live-in relationship with a guy, even moving to a new city with him. He doesn't say one thing about being unhappy, until one day while she's out of the house, he packs up all his shit, leaves, and won't tell her why except ""I need some space"". (Note that he broke up with her ""as truthfully as [he] could"". That's usually a pretty solid sign that a person isn't being very truthful at all, if the _packing up his shit and leaving without any warning_ wasn't already enough to give it away.)

Then, a few days later, he takes her back. Okay, fine, he needs to take things a bit slower; he needs some space, etc. She accommodates that, not complaining if he just goes radio-silent for 3-4 days at a time for no better reason than wanting to not see her. That's pretty hard to swallow from someone who's supposed to love you, but she does it anyway because that's what he says he needs.

I have a very strong hunch OP is sending some pretty mixed signals here, and isn't actually being remotely clear about what he wants from the relationship. It sounds to me like a textbook case of commitment issues that could be helped by a therapist. It could also be that relationships aren't for him, sure. But if that's the case, then he's been a piece of shit for not communicating about it, effectively stringing this woman along for ~2 years. Either he's got some commitment issues that he needs to deal with, or he's got some communication issues that need dealing with because they're hurting people around him. Either way, getting his ass into therapy is a good idea."
"Thanks for the reminder, I sometimes forget that nothing I do will change their minds. I think if I'm a little more outgoing, a little more kind and friendly, that they will have a change of heart. But the truth is, that doesn't ever matter. The right person won't care. Thanks!"
"If the feelings of unhappiness persist for a while (I'd say at least three months, maybe six), it's not just an itch. Since you say it's 97% good, it's time to talk to him about these problems. This is what counseling and legal separation are for. 

Also, start dressing how you want. "

"Not tolerating drugs is a pretty normal, healthy boundary to have.  "
"&gt; Month later, I hear from three girls within our social circle that he got drunk and was being flirtatious with them at a party. Two said that he touched their butt under their skirts, sat one on his lap, and one said that he touched her thigh and held her hand. All three came to me, telling me that they felt uncomfortable and wanted to tell me. Of course, I was livid because by this time, we have been together for two weeks. When I confronted him, he was mad and proclaimed to not remember because he was so drunk.

This is so problematic in so many ways. DO NOT NORMALIZE THIS BEHAVIOR. This is NOT OKAY. At all. 

&gt; I have this masochistic side of me that stays with men that show me who they are then act all surprised when things don't work out.

"I've been trying to take a hike for about a year now. When I first moved in, I only had a closet to myself. Now I have a desk and a closet.

"I've never commented here but I thought it might be helpful to add in my own experience. I lost my father in November and he had an elderly cat. It was either I take her or she would go to a shelter. I've always been a cat person and it broke my heart knowing she lost her person and would now have to go to a stranger. As soon as I was able I brought her to live with my bf and I. Honestly I think she's helped with my grieving because I feel like she's a small part of him. She's certainly as grumpy as he was! 

I don't have much advice beyond I think you should take the cat if you are able to. I'm so sorry for your loss."
"I had an ex boyfriend who strung me along with promises of engagement and marriage for a year, it was a 4 year relationship. I gave him a deadline: summer 2016 or I'm gone. He always made excuses, that he was waiting for this and that, enough money to buy a house, promotion at his job, etc.

That ultimatum made him really look at what he wanted for his life and his feelings for me. When we broke up early summer 2016 it was because he ""realized he wanted to get married, just not to me."" This might be the situation for your boyfriend, and he's just scared of being alone and that's why he's stringing you along.

I made it clear to my now-boyfriend that I will tolerate none of that. I want someone who emphatically wants to be engaged and married to me, someone who loves me so much that it'd be hard to talk them out of marrying me, not someone who I have to bring up the same conversation every other month and get vague responses. 

&gt; since we've never been able to get back to that carefree honeymoon phase 

News flash, this is how long term relationships work. It doesn't sound like he's cut out for one. And with your growing resentment, the outcome is looking really poor.

You don't want to be married to someone who you can't discuss difficult issues with. Communication is so key for long term relationships. You should just walk away from this and find someone who is as into you as you are into them. Someone who's not just with you because they're comfortable and scared to be alone.

&gt; Staying would mean accepting that this might just not ever happen.

You are worth more than that. Picking up your life and moving might be a great thing for you, better than being stuck with this guy..."

And yes, the baby's mama needs to informed about what he did because if I were her I wouldn't want him around my baby.

I don't mean to be rude but you are dangerously naive if you think you could trust your partner to respect you enough to be clean while she is BETRAYING YOUR TRUST, by STICKING ANOTHER MANS DICK IN HER VAGINA. 

Do you really think this way or are you trying to find any angle to justify letting these innocent people be screwed over?  This is literally the mantra of so many people ""it's not my responsibility, so it's not my problem."" Applies to seeing someone mugged, starving children, oppression, discrimination, wars in other countries. And every time we say that, and turn around to get cozy in our own home, we are shocked when suddenly all the evil we turned our backs on shows up at OUR door. Who will speak for us then?

No One. "
It's not always pleasant is all I can say. :(
"10 years ago he was 23 and driving his 14 year old niece and her friend home.  He decides to drop his niece off first (ding ding ding ding ding), then drives the friend home.  You generally keep family in the car as you drop off the friends.  You're taking your daughter, sister, cousin, niece and 4 of her friends home?  You don't drop off family first.  He's not only a sex offender, he's also a habitual liar so pack up and run."
"Oh my God. OP. What is he an expert in? Seriously.

In fact it doesn't even matter. He's ""instructing you"" as an ""expert""? In what, exactly, when he can't even be bothered to clean his house?

OP you need to work on yourself. Everything about this post and your comments is devastating. He's done a real number on you but I suspect your self esteem was always low. I'm glad you are finding his behaviour now to be so unacceptable. Hopefully its the kick you need to step back, realise you can do better, and walk away, to work on yourself. Oh OP. Yikes. Good luck"
"So he's not a total jerk when he doesn't want sex.  Great.  That still doesn't mean he's interested in a deeper commitment.  If anything, the fact he's basically treating you like a girlfriend and still balks at putting that label on things should tell you this isn't going anywhere.  Take him at his word and finds someone who wants what you want now, not someone you hope might eventually see what already seems obvious to you."
"I see a lot of that too.  Enough to avoid vaguebooking, which brings a lot of extra questions, and not enough to be totally intrusive.  Obviously if the person in question doesn't want it to be public then it shouldn't be posted at all, but it is possible to give a general update without giving every gory detail."
"&gt; So do I just wait to see if he comes around and want to be with me or should I try and just walk away?

He's not going to ""come around."" The entire point of FWB is that there is no obligations. It's not an audition for a ""real"" relationship.

Enjoy what you have of him for as long as you're enjoying it, but as soon as it stops being enjoyable, go your own way. You need to set aside all the relationship baggage; when a restaurant stops being good, you just stop going. You don't keep eating there, hoping it will get better, or out of a sense of duty, or out of a fear of upsetting someone. You just stop.

As soon as you start feeling bad, stop going to see him. That might be right now.

**EDIT:** 

&gt; I don't see freinds, I don't go out because I'm petrified that I might have to tell him ""no"" should he call.

Shit, girl. You've pushed all the way into the territory that I described above. You're hurting yourself. Walk away. Walk away right now."

He's selfish. He's an asshole. He's seriously the worst and you deserve better.  That being said- just let him get his stuff and take him to small claims court for the money.

"Wow yeah I can see how it would make you uncomfortable. How do you usually react when she mentions having stolen something? If you're just being passive about it she's never going to get it. I would just be point-blank: ""Wow, that's really shitty of you to steal something you don't even need."" ""I don't know why you're bragging about breaking the law."" ""It makes me really uncomfortable when you say that.""


Also, I mean, she doesn't shoplift when she's with you *as far as you know*. If she's shoplifting as often as you think, she's probably already done it when you've been out together and you just haven't noticed it. Imagine being caught with her. I had a friend in high school who apparently shoplifted all the time but I never knew, and I got caught with her in a Walmart - I had done nothing wrong, but it was incredibly humiliating to be associated with someone who would steal something so stupid."
"What?  I'm not sure you can be ""very, very pro-choice"" if you judge a woman who has an abortion.

I sort of thought, when I read your question, that you'd be posting about how you were having an emotionally difficult time and whether to see a therapist to deal with your feelings.

Maybe that's true and you were going for that direction, but this post really just recounts your friend's abortion in a bad light and then seemed to be basically asking for approval to go tell her you think she was selfish and irrational at a time when she is very sensitive.  

Look, if you truly feel that negatively about her decision, don't say that to her face.  That's just needlessly cruel and I'd be shocked if she had any interest in speaking to you after that anyway.  If you feel that she did something so bad in your eyes that you don't want to be with her anymore, you don't have to.  You're entitled to be friends with whoever you want.

But don't tell her that.  The only outcome is that she won't want to be friends with you after anyway.  And even if you were ok with that, that's a terrible thing to do to someone."
I second this.  I have terrible anxiety and I just use laughing gas at the dentist but even that really helps.  They go as far as knocking you out I believe.  Poor dental hygiene can really negatively affect your health as well.

"Is it the boyfriend who ignores you, or the person that loves you *and* your family? Do you know how rare it is that someone actually likes their in laws?

"Ask him to put himself in your shoes. How would he feel if you were having one-on-one lunches with a male co-worker, being secretive with your phone, and yell at him when he tries to voice his feelings and tell him he's jealous and controlling. Ask him to go to marriage counseling with you together so you can get your marriage back on track.

If he still can't do that, he's probably so deep in the affair fog that he no longer gives a shit about you. That would be time to hire a private investigator and gather evidence, then tell your friends and family what's going on and make the affair something he can no longer keep hidden. And you know in your gut it's not completely platonic and innocent, otherwise he wouldn't be hiding it. So blow it open, because either way your marriage is on the rocks, and you might as well go out fighting."
"This is why I hate living with friends. Rooming together is a business arrangement and that should be it imo. I think what you did was legit. When looking for a place, you pretty much have to act right away. Hopefully she will cool down after some time passes. "

I don't know the dude and I don't judge but it seems to me that he is having a no strings attached relationship with you and you are having a casual but I hope we have a relationship in the future sex with him.

"Yeah, my husband too. He's very frugal, and I can be super frugal at times too. If he was able to score a great deal on flowers by buying them a day early, I would high five him for it and tell him he did good, and I don't think he'd be offended by the question in the least. "
"Quit the drugs and drinking and you may gain a sense of respect for yourself. I'm not saying this negatively, it just appears you attached yourself to the wrong people and value them more than yourself. At 20, you've been homeless, you're concerned about an ex that constantly cheats, you hook up with a mother who doesn't support her own flesh and blood and buys you alcohol and ciggs to deal with your ex and talk? 

Seriously?? Think about it...I'd go home to your family and make the appropriate apologies where needed...you're young and have a long road ahead of you, stop paving it with speed bumps...you owe yourself a smoother ride!!

"I honestly don't think Dork is the villain here. Planning an international group trip sounds like a nightmare when everyone is just like ""Meh whatever, this is your thing, we'll just tag along. How about you do 90% of the planning and work and we'll just sit back being lax but you need to let us completely disregard the itinerary when we see fit because it's 6 against 1!""

If part of the itinerary sounds off (30 minutes for 7 people to eat sounds a little insane, unless it's a packed lunch. Even still...) then give very specific feedback. Say, ""Dork, how about we do a 45 minute lunch break instead, and shave 15 minutes off the hike?"" I went on a group trip to Japan with 11 people, and the itinerary looked a lot like Dork's where the time for each activity was very tightly planned - because it needs to be with a group like that. Especially if you're trying to get a lot out of each day.

Another alternative that worked well on my group trip - just plan a block of time at each activity/location and set a meeting spot so people can break off and do what they want at their leisure. So show up at the hiking spot, pick a meeting area, and say ""Okay guys let's all meet back here in 2 hours!"" That way everyone can explore at their own pace. Also good to have some way of communicating if you're running late, but don't completely ignore the schedule just to be selfish.

Sounds like he didn't book the Airbnbs because people are dragging their feet paying him. Maybe he gave everyone a month to pay up and didn't realize how quickly they'd get snatched up. I know you paid your bit but I wouldn't book accommodations without ALL of the money up front either, so maybe you guys should be hounding the people who didn't pay up yet even though the ""deadline"" hasn't come yet.

Planning a group trip is hard. It sounds like he is putting in a lot of work as the person who is the most invested in the trip, but everyone just wants him to do the planning but also not adhere to an itinerary. Of course stuff goes wrong but I don't understand how you guys agree with the itinerary but insist that you shouldn't have to follow it without offering up some sort of alternative to the schedule. It's like the group is trying to make it as difficult for him as possible. "

If you could step outside of your body, and imagine a friend telling you that she's going through what you're going through - what advice would you give her? I'm sure you would say that being alone is better than being with someone who treats you so terribly. 

You may not believe it, but you deserve better. No one deserves to be treated the way that you're being treated. I think you need to talk to a close loved one or family member and ask them for help. It's time. "
"Everyone else is giving good advice. I'm in the ""tell her the truth"" camp but with a caveat. I have a friend that was in a long term abusive relationship and I knew it at the time. I made the mistake of telling her how much I hated him PERSONALLY instead of gently explaining that the stuff he was DOING was not good/healthy/normal. She ended up getting defensive of him, or downright lying to me about things he would do to her. Not saying Tom is abusive but it is very important to tell Laura how SHE is affected by him in a way that does not make her feel like she needs to defend him personally."

In my college there are so many ages and many people don't finish is 4 years so there are many many 23 year olds. "
"&gt;I know that couples go through rough times and that's why it has taken me this long to actually brake it off, because I thought that we could go back to the way it was. Instead of dealing with that nagging feeling that something was wrong, I've been supressing it and now it's too late. 

I'm not necessarily saying you did the wrong thing by breaking up with this specific guy, but I can tell you, for the future, that things DO NOT get better when you suppress your feelings. You have to communicate about what's wrong. A breakup should never come as a total surprise to the other person, unless they're an oblivious idiot (or they're an abuser that you need to sneak out of the house to get away from, of course, but that's not relevant here) because you should have been talking with him about your feelings and how to fix things this whole time.  You speak of falling into a ""too comfortable"" period, but were you asking him to go out places with you and he was refusing, or were you both just... comfortable, in what he thought was a committed relationship?

In any case, it's unlikely that you'll be able to remain friends. That usually only happens when you were friends for a long time before dating. "

"It sounds like she has ADHD or dyspraxia. I've got ADHD and am incredibly clumsy, you pretty much described me with how she drops and bumps into things.  She needs to get medically evaluated.

"You told him, very clearly, when he asked that you did not want the tandem.  It's his money, it's his problem.  He's trying to manipulate you into staying with him over guilt because of *his* purchase.  It's his purchase and his problem, not yours.  Break up with him and do not give him any money.  You said no, and he ignored you.  He's being manipulative, and you should not bend to it.  He's verbally abusive and you do not deserve that from a partner."
"Wow, you come across as really self aware here!  Please let us have an update.

Also, I hope you find someone who knows how smart and great you are :D"
"I am Asian, and also send money home to support the family. I am lucky to have a sibling who shares the responsibility with me, unlike your couch-potato of a brother. Honestly, given your situation, I would probably send less money to your mother each month, at least by half. (That's if you still want a relationship with them, if you do not care as much, you can cut it all off but I suspect that is not what you want to do :)) If the brother was at least trying to get his life together, I *may* let it go but it's all dependent on other factors as well.

Tell them that since you won't be getting the house, you looked into houses as you want to own one and a portion will HAVE to go to the mortgage instead. They whine? Tough, ""You guys took away the house that I thought I would co-own, this is the only rational choice I have to make sure my future is more stable""."
"We don't owe each other anything, but I've always thought we were in a mutual give-and-take relationship.  Now I'm starting to wonder if I'm the only one giving and everyone else is taking.  Why do I get to be the pension fund ATM machine just because it's socially acceptable behavior? I'll take care of you them but at least make sure my brother and I get equal stakes in whatever we have."
"Beth is an adult.  The guys she's dating are adults.  Just stay out of it.  It's not your circus, not your monkeys."
"I mean, it sounds like your roommate resents your boyfriend for being your boyfriend. If your roommate has been icy to your boyfriend and noticeably lusting after you, your boyfriend has put up with a lot already."
Sorry no it failed because the husband didn't bother. 
"Your boyfriend is a racist pig, plain and simple. He isn't a ""great guy"", he's a nasty racist asshole. He isn't ""just jealous"", he's a hateful shithead. He isn't ""telling jokes"", he's showing you quite blatantly who he really is. And the fact that you're only ""starting to get uncomfortable"" is probably why he does what he does because he sees you won't do or say anything about it after saying vicious and disgusting things for who knows how long. 

ETA after seeing OP's response to another comment it's pretty obvious why she hasn't dumped him. Must be hard to dump someone you agree with."
"In your case I think it'd more fun if you have your boyfried or a group of friends to dance with, otherwise it's mostly grinding with strangers or awkwardly drinking by yourself unless you get lucky and meet someone friendly or you're a social kind, but you described yourself in a way that makes me think you're more reserved and wanting to try this thinking it'll fulfill you in some way.

I want to say: there are lots of kinds of parties, and different kinds of frats. I think frats are more fun for people involves in frats and sororities who know the people and get involves in activies ect. Because while not all frats are the same.. the parties are mostly about sex, hooking up, and getting drunk. And there isn't really a point to those things if you aren't looking to hook up and drink for the sake of it/have no one to drink with. I love to dance but you can go to bars or clubs. You're not 21 yet but there are still concerts and shows you can get into where you can dance and have fun and meet people, and you'll be 21 still. Honestly the only reason I think you'd want to go to a frat if you're introverted with a boyfriend is if you have some girlfriends in a sorority or who like frats who you can go and dance with. Otherwise, you will not meet anyone or really have anything to show for going to a frat, the idea it's an experience is only somewhat true bc it doesn't mean it's worthwhile experience.

I know some people will tell you frats are safe or they are in a good frat, and that's true, but I went to a frat for the first time and was assaulted. I do wish I hadn't gone because I was pressured by friends who enjoyed them to act a certain way instead of testing out how i felt in the new environment and it ended up with me not having anyone to support me or validate me when I was assaulted. 
If your boyfriend is worried for you, I would tell him that you want to dance and cut loose but yes you do need him there to help you test out a new environment and help you feel safe, and once you two have gotten a feel for what it's like you can decide to go alone or with a friend or not go anymore.He doesn't ahve to go back but you want to try it and he should support you.

If he doesn't want to go, he doesn't want to, that's okay. You can't force him. Let me tell you that if you don't go to a frat, that's ok, and most likely you won't be assaulted, and you may have a good time. But it's also ok to go and not have a good time, be bored or feel excldued-- but I don't tihnk it's safe to go to a frat you don't know anyone or the culture of without anyone you know to keep an eye on you-- I know someone whose drnk was drugged-- these things really do happen-- and you can be pressured to do things you don't want to do, and at a frat, there isn't necessarily much else to do...-- there are many colleges that don't even have frats, and many kinds of parties besides frats, parties for friends, house shows, concerts, events at bars... there's just so many ways to have the kind of exciting experiences you're having and for some people they find out frats work for them but what works best for me is finding a few people I bond with and drinking with them, I like to go to the bar with my boyfriend or drink with my co workers or with my friend and paint or play video games, that's my kind of party, and that's also ""a college experience"". I guess what I'm trying to say is don't feel pressured to fit into an image of what college life is and if it doens't look like feel you are missing out, those things start to fade away as you get to college-- what you really should look for is what happiness looks like for you, and growing as a person and having new experiences is part of that, but also if something doesn't fit you, toss it out. Have fun, be safe."
"You must have missed this lesson somewhere or sometime in life. What you describe there is dating. You are essentially asking us if you can date. I am not your mother, but if I was I'd say yes, go out in this world and set up as many dates as you can until you find the one that you want to date long term and she wants the same. "

"Counseling could be a good way to build up to a divorce. 

But you didn't mention one positive thing about this guy.  Why are you with him in the first place?"
"Or - just to be fair - they're totally self employed with a flexible schedule, like me :)"
Sounds like your gf is right. 
"Grocery shopping is pretty much it, haha. My mom does come by once a week but I use that as a time to catch up on house and yard work (we just moved into a new house three months ago and there's a lot we have yet to do)."
"It's cliche but lawyer up, hit the gym and unless you genuinely want to make yourself miserable, minimise contact. I am a firm believer that living well is the best revenge. "
Don't bring it up. He's entitled to his privacy and he chose not to tell you for a reason.
"Lol. You don't have kids, do you"
That's a really good idea. 
"I didn't mean to make it sound like you should feel bad for him or anything. In fact my point is exactly that this is a situation that he brought upon himself, and that's why he's looking around for anyone or anything to blame it on."
"Well, you could always show her this weird ass ranking system you came up with in which you call her lazy, clingy, and throw shade at her intellectual abilities, among other things, and she'll probably go ahead and do the breaking up for you.... but seriously dude, if you have thought about breaking up with her EVERY WEEK for *three years* and still haven't pulled the trigger, there's literally nothing anyone on reddit can say to you to make it stick. Maybe therapy is a good idea."
"Im giving you examples. You need to navigate your own life situations to find less aggressive methods of approaching them. Even if that means biting your tongue and the company takes a fine. You said yourself you're entry level, they'll ask when they want to hear your opinion, and it wont be until you've been employed for awhile. 

I didnt say youre currently oversharing. Im trying to suggest methods for you to be more passive in the work place. Especially if youre entry level. 

Even there you volunteered information about yourself. Ask for some random further detail about their story and move along. They say they went camping... you ask ""That sounds lovely, how long have you and your partner been into hiking/camping."" or ""how did you get into camping? The start up costs keep stopping me."" in the second example you told a little about yourself, appearing open, but kep the focus on them. Best of both worlds. And then go back to work. "
Nobody else seems to be catching this point but if you have been dating for 2.5 years then at minimum he missed/ made no effort for last year's bday either.  That's just selfish. He doesn't need or deserve a fancy putting or gift if he hasn't done anything for you 2 years in a row. Give him a card and call it a day. More effort than him but not by much. Don't bend over backwards for someone that can't even bend over for you.
"How do you even know if she's interested in you? I think it's a little early to be jumping to ""getting into marital life"" when you haven't even dated the woman or gauged her interest. "
"Honestly, OP, get a second opinion.
  Have them check for everything again.  Judging by your comments something is going on with you &amp; I don't think reddit has the certification to assess it."
"I would like to add that if you do end up screwing up somewhere down the road, she may take the chance to use it as an excuse to micro manage you again. Don't let that happen.

My dad let me fuck up on my own and he helped me fix it when I went to him for help. He never told me what to do and I'm forever grateful to him for that. It was a very big change from how he tried to run my life in high school and I think he understood how it messed me up when I was on my own."
"Ya the waiting game is an option, just one that I thought would be over by now. I don't plan on proposing to her unless I intend to carry out the proposal and marry her."
Hi it's me your best friend. When are we going?
"Can I ask why you chose those three places for one trip? None of them are very close to eachother, or even flow very well. Those are all places you could do separately in their own vacations spread out. Choose one for your honeymoon, take your daughter to one of them as a family vacation maybe later in the year, and save one for your one year anniversary maybe? I mean clearly money or time is no issue for you to take a month off and jetset around the world, what would be the harm in breaking them up?"
"The outrage boiled over at the resource problem, but I'd guess it's been growing a while as OP drags her feet, treating husband's issue like an afterthought. "
"Yeah, she's jealous. It may not even be conscious. 

But as a woman about to turn 34, I'm already feeling the sense of rejection as a desirable woman (even though I objectively still am). The message is very clear: young is desirable. 31 is ancient. 

A single woman at 48? Despite being gorgeous, smart, financially secure, etc... the message is still ""a 22 year old checkout clerk is more desirable.""

Then you come along, so confident and satisfied that you're rejecting free drinks! Our minds automatically create a narrative to preserve cognitive bias (in favor of ourselves). Maybe hers is ""OP may be attracting strangers, but she isn't as smart as I am."" Then, that narrative colors your interactions.

Your best bet is to develop a rapport. Go to her and say you **admire her**, that you truly want her professional **and personal** advice. The best way to shut it down is to make yourself a real person; seek her mentorship.

Of course, it should be genuine and not forced. But it honestly sounds like you do admire her."
"call the local tenant-landlord association for advice.  


But I think they're going to say for you to move.  I'm not clear why you can't move to a different apartment.  Can you find a new roommate situation?  I've had great luck on craigslist. 


Your roommate is CHOOSING his GF over you.  He's not going to move out, and he's not going to support you. I'm sorry.


Take your non-perishables and put them in your room and lock the door.  


Don't engage with either of them. Stay in your room until you move out.  


I don't know if crazy GF would try to hurt your dog - can you keep him with a friend for a few weeks?


Hang in there, OP!"
"I'm glad someone else noticed that too. Yeah, rough patches last at least that long sometimes. What happens if she loses a family member or friend and needs to grieve for that long? "
Most commenters are reacting to the fact that she lied to her partner of 7 years which oddly enough is the sort of behaviour that people rightfully read into.
"He tracks your movements? Maybe that's another factor, he won't have as much control over you. Please, get out op. Abort abort abort!!!"
"Wow. You realize that children aren't tiny adults, right? Good lord. "
"I am no expert, but I feel like folks get fired for inappropriate FBing a lot. Or at least I see BuzzFeed articles that have examples? Trashing a boss, trashing a company, misuse of sick leave, admitting to stealing from an employer, etc. Like you said, behaving poorly as a representative of the company.

I know that isn't exactly the case here, but I do believe that HR departments are very interested in and open to using FB behavior to build an argument for dismissal."
Why not tell her husband though? Unless he has a history of homophobia or getting jealous of platonic male relationships I see no reason to go to such lengths and make up an entirely different story of how her night went.

"Birthday Girl gets to decide who she wants at her birthday lunch. 

Honestly, I think you are making a way bigger deal out of this than needs to be. In a normal friendship outside of work, sure, you would be justified in saying something about being left out. But this isn't a normal friendship. This is a work relationship and while you might be friendly with each other, you aren't really friends. You might see them as friend-friends but they see you as a work-friend. And they are allowed to not invite you to things. The other co-workers they invited? Probably friend-friends. 

But, really, it's not worth getting all upset about because you still have to work with them. And because they don't see you as a friend-friend, it's going to put them in an incredibly awkward position if you make a big deal about it and then they might feel obligated to invite you even if they don't want to and that will ruin it for all involved. "
"The ""take care of me"" actually made me say ""wow"" out loud. I shouldn't be, but I'm amazed when guys are this blatant about it. "
"You weren't wrong, you had no obligation to put your housing plans (and the plans of 2 other people) in jeopardy because of her indecision. And she wasn't even honest and straightforward with you from the start that she was considering other options, only hesitated once you needed a quick decision to secure the house. The only thing you could have done better was tell her ""either commit now and get me the rent today/tomorrow, or I will contact other people to see if I can fill your spot"", that way she'd at least have had the opportunity to either commit or if she couldn't you'd be completely in the clear. But given the circumstances, the fact that you were panicking about housing and she'd not been straightforward with you and this was urgent, I think what you did was fair enough. You asked her to commit, she refused. You weren't obligated to wait for her, but at most you should just have explicitly told her you wouldn't wait."
Therapy~ You're 27 and dating a 19-year old. For the past three months. Chill out. (Personal: I've been dating my boyfriend for five years and we see each other about once a week.)
"Or go do something relationship-reaffirming. If you start to feel jealous about the connection you're imagining they had, call him up and have a cute chat with him. Pick him up a coffee and drop it off at his job (if feasible). Plan a cute date for you guys. Take the focus off of what they had, and build up you guys. Remind yourself that you guys have a great connection too! And the fact that he had a good connection with someone else doesn't take away from that!

It might even be worth it to pick up a hobby with him so you feel less like you guys don't share something. Make sure it's something unique to you guys and that you both can enjoy/bond over, not just a cheap emulation of his ex. Don't be someone you're not -- he likes you!"
"It's usually not especially helpful to have these kinds of discussions with regard to sex, ""you never do X"" or ""I always have to do Y"".  Instead, let her know what she could do to make you happy.  Maybe that starts out with you asking her for a BJ while you're making out, i dunno."
"So she can't travel by herself, isn't allowed to have hobbies or friends, and can only see a therapist with your permission? You've proved that the therapist is right. You don't want a relationship of equals. You want someone to control."
"&gt;two people can't have a connection via eye contact??

Yes, they can. It's called lust, or physical attraction. Or at the very most one of them has a general 'presence'. But you can't really know a ton from a gaze. Just what you can read from their body language. 

Try to imagine yourself sharing that same feeling you have with him with a 76 year old homeless man with 3 teeth on the street. If you can't imagine it there, why is that?"
I had to look it up and now I want to find a way to use it in a conversation
"This is important. OP, you had every right to give that spot away, but it would have been courteous to let her know so she could make a decision once and for all."
Wouldst thou like fries with that?
It's inappropriate and weirdly paternal on the coach's part but I guess it's up to her how she wants to deal with it.
"Yup. And don't be fooled. Even if you did move (which I am glad to see you are not doing!) there would be some other reason why you come last to everything else in his life.

He's told you and shown you that you aren't a priority. Believe him. You deserve more "
"&gt; I mean, if you trust your aunt and uncle in other shit, why not trust them on this and wait til you are 16? 

Because there's no indication that OP's aunt and uncle have plans to tell him once he hits 16? That's something that commenters here have come up with on their own. If he's old enough to ask questions, he's old enough to get answers. If his aunt and uncle had straight-up said, ""Wait till you're 16,"" that'd be different. But they haven't, so I don't see why he should sit on his hands and wait instead of figuring out a better way to ask now."
You need to tall to your girl dude. You know she is going through stuff and waiting for her to tell you she needs to talk isn't going to word. Sound like you guys have no communication 
"Doesn't matter, he caves over this and the whole thing is poisoned."

"OP, this entire post is terrifying to read. 

First, if someone is your ""Best Friend Forever"" after 8 months of meeting them randomly on an app, I have to ask if you move in with an SO after a month of dating. It takes longer than 8 months to be at the point of family level areas of familiarity. 

Secondly, How the fuck can you not see how wrong this was?"

"I have ""friends"" like this. I know that they make more money than my SO and I do, but we just budget a bit better. My SO and I saved up and bought a house a few months ago. Our friends got incredibly jealous and kept telling us we're just more ""privileged"" than they are - even though demographically we're the same and their parents help them out more than ours do. So, we have slowly stopped hanging out with these people. "

"Get  
over  
yourself.

If she wants to break up with you, there is no strategy or method you can employ to change her mind. Call her and ask her if she's thinking about breaking up with you. There is a 75% chance she is, and a 50% chance that a conversation about breaking up will lead to a breakup. That is a good thing.

After she breaks up with you, take some time to heal and reflect on your relationship so your next relationship is stronger."
"You're 26 in the year 2017 and you own a car and a house and have a successful career, investments, and savings. Holy crap, you're a unicorn. 

So you showed up in shorts - yeah, not the best call. The flowers? That's a matter of taste, and it's in incredibly poor taste to call out the quality of a gift. Her dad should be ashamed of himself. 

I don't think loaning a friend (or anyone) $6K is probably a great call, not without a contract/promissory note and an interest charge. I'm glad you're getting things from this guy's parents. But your loan is none of her parents' business and I'm mortified that they know about this. She needs to shut her mouth about your personal financial transactions. 

And speaking of shutting her mouth, what's this crap about there being something they don't like that she won't tell you? Ohhhhh. She also told you to ""man up"" but won't say what she meant ... Okay. I get it. They - and she - expect you to either ""take care of her"" or actually get engaged to her. That has got to be what that means. She can't ask you to ask her to marry her. She can't ask you to start spending all of your money on her. But she can hint at that shit. 

Maybe her parents don't like you having flatmates because they want you to let their daughter live with you rent-free? Even though they don't like you and are rude to you? Nope, nope, nope. Flatmates is an amazing way to help pay down your mortgage. You're doing the right thing. If her parents were smart about finances, they'd know this. But that doesn't seem to be their concern. 

Dude, this is not good. Your girlfriend is still under the influence of her parents in ways that make her disloyal to you, and that's some bullshit. 

You sound like a stable, smart guy with a great future. You're good and generous to your friends. You listen. You try. I'm gonna say you deserve better than what this girl is doing to you right now. I hope you can gain enough confidence in yourself to realize that you don't need fixing - aside from maybe buying a nice pair of long pants. 

I'm gonna add here that when my dad met my mom back in 1964, he was 32 years old and living in a house that he owned, with rooms rented out to his friends. He was essentially a ""confirmed bachelor"" who hadn't met the right woman yet, and you have to know how rare that was in those days, for a guy who was a successful businessman, smart, handsome, and 6'6""! Then he saw my mom in a restaurant and knew he had to meet her. He walked away from his food and followed her outside when she left, to introduce himself. She was only 23, but mature. Luckily, they had a friend in common that came up in conversation, and he got a date. They were married three months later, to the day, and have been married for 53 years this summer. What I'm saying is, you have your shit together, and you may not have trouble getting dates, but don't just settle. Wait for the right one, as long as it takes. You've got your house and your career and your friends. You don't need to put up with subpar girlfriends. My dad didn't. He took his time, and got it right.

He took it a third time and passed. The big difference maker was that he quit working for a couple months to prep for the test. His drive wasn't any different. He just had more time to study. If your gf doesn't pass, just be sure to emphasize that she didn't maximize her chance to pass. It's not about her capability; rather, it's about her inability to capitalize on her capability because she didn't have enough time set aside to study.

Best I got."

"The opposite, however, may also happen: she has the child mostly because of Sam and then resents him for all the consequences of having a baby. Also not good for the relationship. "
"He completely disregarded your views, did something he knew you wouldn't approve of, and now is avoiding the responsibility by not answering his phone."
That could be why she doesn't remember your number as well. I still remember my home phone number from when I was a kid but I can't tell you any of the numbers of my sister's cell. I just don't need to know it. That's what my phone is for. 
"Sounds like a major case of male provider guilt shame spiral into depression:

You live with a couple that is more financially stable than your husband.

You were talking about having kids and then he lost his job. Suddenly he's sleeping on the couch and doesn't want to touch you.

He then fell into a giant depression shame spiral. Sounds to me like his behavior is entirely motivated by self-loathing. It's important to remember that YOU can't talk someone out of something like this, because it's entirely generated by their own internal expectations of what kind of person (in this case man/husband/father) they should be.

He is going out all night, where do you think he is staying? Obviously somewhere. My guess is that he is involved with someone(s) younger and less put together than you and your friends, who makes him feel like the adult in the room.

Unfortunately he is probably too deep into it to salvage anything. He does not have any emotional coping skills, those take time and work to cultivate. Without them he is externalizing all of his garbage. I mean, you could try to fix things, but if your really want kids, you need to take a clear look at whether or not it can happen with him."

"Have a little empathy for the guy - he grew up in a culture that taught him it's shameful for men to need help. Find a therapist who does exposure therapy - it'll be action/behavior oriented, he'll get directions on exactly what to do differently without it feeling like he has to sit in ""feelings world"" too long. Maybe ask a dentist if they have ever referred to anyone, or search online. 

You can really insist that he goes to the dentist and/or counselor, because you care about him and don't want him to be sick, get consequences from work/friends etc. "
I usually just leave out a bowl of kibble for mine.
"I'm sorry girl. I think this might be a case of he's just not that into you.

"When I was a kid, my mom lost an expensive pair of earrings my dad gave her for birthday hours after getting them. It was a milestone birthday like 40 or something. We of course called the restaurant where we celebrated and the entire family spent a couple of hours turning the house and car upside down looking for them, but we couldn't find them. 

My mom is definitely not the tidiest person, but I don't think she can be called messy. She was of course upset. I was upset as well because my mom lost a beautiful present and because I knew my dad must have spent a ton on them. I'm sure my dad was annoyed as well. But my dad comforted her and told her that these things happen. It is the nature of small things to get lost and that we just needed to let it go. So the two of them put it behind them and we went on to enjoy the rest of our day. When I asked her later, she told me that she was upset about the loss of the earrings, but she would always have the sentiment that was behind them.

That incident always stood out to a young me as the grown up way of handling things and that's how I aspire to be.

"It's a terrible idea. It's a new relationship that already has other issues and should be approached more cautiously. 
His insistence on the idea despite your reservations is a massive red flag, and good reason to suggest that he *is* looking for a bangmaid.  

A boyfriend who cared about you would understand that you are uncomfortable, give you more time, and ask what he could do that would help the relationship progress to a point where you would feel ready.  

This guy is all kinds of shady, and breaking up over this would be well to your advantage."
Are you enjoying this sex?  Is it possible you aren't turning it down because you enjoy it? Some women have reactive libidos.
"$60 a day?! I don't think I spend more than $10 a day on average for non-essentials.  Maybe $20 a day when I'm busy for a while and can't cook every meal.

Also, where is this money coming from? You say you give him a ""generous sum of money every day for spending."" You say he hasn't ""worked harder or gotten any extra jobs"" so I'm assuming he has a job. Why are you giving him an allowance? Stop enabling him.

He straight out told you he's not going to change anymore than he already had. In your heart of hearts, you know he's going to start secretly borrowing money again. Are you willing to let him put you in more debt every year? What if he starts making credit cards in your children's names and screwing up their credit? You have to make the decision that protects your and your children's futures."
Continue your plans with your boyfriend and skip their game night without a single word. Spend that time with the person who loves or cares about you.

"You can continue to ignore the red flags and stay if you want, but if you've tried mentioning this issue and he ignores it or says it's normal, how do you expect the situation is going to get any better?

Are you going to continually walk on eggshells and hope you don't do anything to set off his irrational temper?  Are you doing that already?  This sub is typically full of ""just break up"" but I really think that's your best option.

"
"Thanks - I have considered therapy to try and deal with my mother and my issues before, just haven't happened. I might have to do that."
"Also, how much time does it really take to stop by the store and pick up some chocolate or buy something on Amazon? No one is so busy they can't spare thirty minutes to make their partner happy."
"You don't owe him anything, and you're not tearing your family apart. What he did was abuse, and you're having a really reasonable reaction to it. Frankly, I think you're probably being too charitable to him, but that's yours to sort out. I'd talk to your therapist to try to untangle exactly what it is you want from your relationship with him. Do your other family members support you/acknowledge the abuse? Have you considered a different therapist if you have the means and support to do so? Sometimes coming to an impasse in therapy is a sign that your therapist might not be a good fit anymore. 

You probably have a long way to go in letting yourself believe that your abuse was real, and healing from that. Don't beat yourself up for being disgusted by your father- his behavior was disgusting, and you can't just flip a switch and like him again. It's 100% OK to have messy feelings toward the whole situation, and honestly, it's 100% OK if you eventually decide that he's not worth pursuing a relationship with. (I will also include an obligatory referral to r/raisedbynarcissists. The sub gets a terrible rep but lots of posters over there struggle with some of the same things and understand emotional abuse better than most of Reddit)

"No he isn't sweet to you, he threatens to beat you and cheat on you, he's controlling and shady and he's outright telling you this relationship will end. By no definition is this sweet, this is abusive. And no, he doesn't seem to be crazy about you, he seems to be crazy about his ex."
My assumption was that's including her undergrad since she's 23. So that's actually about normal.
"&gt;stems from the idea many have that bisexual men are just gay men in denial. 

This is why I needed so desperately to vocalise whats going on in my head. Thank you for raising this. I read a lot of material when I found out. Some from academic sources and some just going on to LGBT websites. I read about how unfair bi erasure is but then almost immediately after read dozens of gay coming out stories that went the bi route. Many of them werent even being maliciously deceptive, they just didnt understand that their hetero experience was a dud until they had a physical same sex encounter.   

So thats one of the thousands of thoughts running through me; maybe the only way I can be sure that I am his ultimate is if he has a same sex fling. Maybe I should guve him a pass to explore? But then maybe that would really end whats left of the marriage. I'm clearly not doing well with jealousy.   

Thanks for letting me go off on my crazy lady tangent. "
"To be fair, it only happened sporadically. I think there may have been a year between last time and this time. I think he just likes her company, there was a reason we hit it off after all!

But that's mostly the point. I don't want to tell him I have a problem with one of his friends, I really hate it, and we should have never gotten here in the first place. He's aware of this. "
"I know this comment isn't really at the heart of the ""crux"" of your issue, but lots of parents feel the way your husband does. 

I joke with my wife all the time that I'm ready to go back to work so I'll have less to do. I'm fortunate to have a job that pays well, but is also relatively low in stress -- definitely lower in stress than a 4 year and a 10 year old. 

While my wife doesn't exactly put things the same way, she feels that way too a lot in that it's difficult for her to get any space in the house where she won't be bothered. "
"My impression as a man has always been that women friends act together in ways that would be seen as flirting and beyond for men and women (and that men together would be horrified by).

Some women seem almost to be playing 'lesbian chicken' to prove to each other how intense their friendship is. I have no idea how lesbians deal with it but you need to be aware of it."
"She saw you approach her, and decided she didn't want to talk to you. This was the consequence of your action. You know she doesn't want to talk to you; she blocked you everywhere. This was just a confirmation that she didn't change your mind and you should've took it and fucking liked it, instead of going around her back to get her number anyway because you need a warm body again. 

You don't realize you messed up. You said ""it was in the past"" like time and a ""sorry"" should erase the fucked up way you treated a friend of many years. You have no idea what you did. "
"&gt;Like sometimes car mechanics do bad jobs, but you don't go running after them demanding payment for the and job they've done.


Yes, you do. Well more accurately you go after their insurance company if they're licensed and insured.

You broke her phone then further fucked it up with your repair. You're liable for all issues resulting from the damage you caused and the repair you made. 

Pay her back *but not without seeing the receipt*."
"Thanks. Its hard to recognize the pattern because things will be good for a year or two before they get this bad. That's why I've kept up with therapy, to try to keep it good when it's good. But recently I've recognized the pattern. 

Also, we both desperately wanted to raise our son in an intact family. We both have hang ups that come from split homes and I dread the thought of exposing my son to the things I went through (or my husband went through) because of divorce. Mostly abusive step parents that the other parent couldn't protect us from because of joint custody. 

That's why divorce is such a hard conclusion for us to come to. "
"Like rush once sang ""if choose not to choose you still have made a choice"""
"Yeah, you don't get to decide that she should just live normally when her husband is dying.

She has a therapist. She has a psychiatrist. I highly doubt that she's decided ""hey, my husband is dying and I'm going to try and make this situation worse"". I'm kinda curious about what else you're expecting her to do? Being in therapy doesn't mean that you're issues disappear overnight or that you're suddenly an expert at coping with someone withering away right in front of you. Quite frankly expectations that everything should be better overnight can result in someone putting off getting treatment. It feels like a ""you're not better, so you're not trying"" stamp.

Help her out practically and let her have her feelings if you want to help instead of trying to police her reaction. If you can't do that, you are free to step away. It's not easy helping someone. You'll do more damage than good if you tell her to get herself together. It's not like she's completely unaware that there's probably someone who would handle everything by your definition of perfectly. She just can't do that. Literally can't. But from what you wrote it sure looks like she's trying."
"""As long as we're not doing something I need her for""

"Do NOT create any sexy time videos or pictures with this man. He doesn't respect you, and until he does (which I seriously doubt will ever happen, you really should leave him) you should not do this. You are being sexually abused, you may not realize it. But don't give him any material to possibly blackmail you with, or that might follow you after the inevitable breakup. At the very least you wouldn't want to have records of painful, coerced sex. Respect your own body twice as much to make up for his lack in doing so. "
"&gt;But life is more complex than that. 

If you stay with this...character...you'll look back 5 years from now and see just how complex your life has become, none of it in a good way."
"I'm really sorry. That must hurt a lot.


It's not very comforting now, but someday you will be very thankful that you didn't wind up in a relationship with a racist. You'll find someone eventually who isn't racist, or at least not more than the usual unconscious racism we all carry around, and who will treat you with respect and caring."
"You should understand that your friend crossed a line and tried to make a move on someone already in a relationship. You should understand why that upsets your girlfriend and why she would probably want you to cut contact.

You might not have feelings for the friend, but the friend has proven that it doesn't matter to her. She will still cross the line of what's appropriate. And the fact that you let her says a lot about your own character. "
"We weren't rude to the other guests at our table. They were family members of ours, and they thought the whole thing was weird too. They wanted the kids to sit with us. And honestly, they should have been paying for my kids' food anyway. If they didn't want to, they shouldn't have invited them. They were owed lunch, and they got lunch, same as everyone else. It's rude to invite someone to a party, have a huge, nice spread of food dangled in front of their face, and then give them a few measly nibbles.

I'm not saying I'm going to call her up and scream at her, just wanted to tell her what happened, clear it up if there was a misunderstanding."
"Sexuality can certainly be fluid but there's nothing wrong with boxes. I don't understand this big aversion to boxes and labels people have. That is how we as humans function, we name and categorize to be able to understand our world, ourselves, how we perceive it, and to be able to communicate with each other. There's nothing wrong with being who you are no matter what the label. 

Imagine if everything had no label, was vague or undefined, we wouldn't be able to function at all: 'Is that a sofa? Yes, maybe, sometimes, it's actually a unicorn"". We wouldn't exist as a species without our ability to categorize and communicate it would be total chaos.  How would you even begin to grow as a person if you don't know who you are as a starting point to grow from. 

Can people's sexuality evolve? Sure. But completely denying it ever was or is  serves no purpose other than understanding yourself less. Even if she really is completely straight now pretending she wasn't sexually into women is just denial. "
"You've already gotten great advice here, I just have a question for you. You're 21 and already teaching? That's so quick! Have you already graduated an education program? You must have worked really hard for that, I'm super impressed."
"I don't see the same outcome as you to the complaint against the wedding planner.

1) If it really was the wedding planner's fault and the cousin takes it well, maybe they get a poor review or feedback, but none of that matters because you'll never see that person again anyway.

2) If it was the wedding planner's fault and the cousin takes it poorly, then it's just someone complaining about something that happened on her special day, and making it worse and less about her.

3) If it was her fault and she says ""Actually, that was my decision"", then you've got that family drama I was talking about.

4) If it was her fault, and she doesn't admit it, she'll still know it internally and might complain to others later, or just carry around an internal conflict and perpetuate the cycle of passive-aggression.

When you want to have human relationships with real people, sometimes you've got to let things go.  This is a good chance to be the bigger person.  The kids are old enough that they can take the lesson, too.  ""I'm sorry things didn't go well, but it was your relative's big day and she put a lot of effort into trying to make it perfect, so let's not make the issues we had with the wedding bother her."""
"It's not your responsibility to help him save money. Frankly, I can't believe he even asked you, a person he knows for 6 weeks for this.

You focus a lot on her behavior but what was your bf doing the whole time? Acting normal? Or was he also stroking her face and hair?
Cool. And I hope you and your partner would have that conversation. The OP is not okay with it and made it known. I don't see why you're trying to equate your feelings on a subject in a totally different situation than what the OP is dealing with. 
I'm sorry but why in the hell would you want to date a 16 year old? Lets say you stick it out. She is gonna want a wild phase eventually. Also don't know where you live but this is very illegal in a lot of places. 
I think a lot of people would draw the line there with the Snapchat. I generally wouldn't ask questions about porn at all but chatting involves another in a way that just watching porn doesn't.
Occam's razor is an incredible tool...
Are you sure that you even want to be friends with him? Screw him. 
"Ok. Still doesn't make it a good idea. 

Anyway, listen: Absolutely all the advice you have received is in agreement: *this is his choice not to talk to you*, and *you need to respect that*

There is nothing more to be said. Yes, it sucks. But that's life. 

If you chase him down at school or at work that IS stalking. 

You choosing to date someone much younger IS suspicious, and it DOES look to us like you are doing it (a) because you can push him around and (b) because you are immature.

People break up for the most trivial reasons, reasons that would hurt you more to know than it hurts *not* knowing..

Almost every sentence you write says ""I WANT"". OK, fine, you are allowed to have wants. But at no point do you ever respect what HE wants  - he wants to be left alone.

"A Valentine's day message is something that would absolutely bother me. My boyfriend has a child with someone else and because she doesn't respect our relationship they only speak when it comes to their child to avoid any problems. Did you speak to him and tell him it makes you uncomfortable?  If you did and he brushed it off he might not be over her. Hope you figure it out, it's never easy dealing with someone who has a kid but if he's serious about your relationship he will consider your feelings."

You really think there is nothing more unhealthy than a redbull? LOL WUT
"your completely non-hormonal options are:

- condoms (over the counter)
- diaphragm or cervical cap (less popular now than before, but you can still get them.  Try Planned Parenthood for this if you want one).
- contraceptive sponge (over the counter)
- copper IUD

You would probably be OK with condoms plus one of the other barrier methods as long as you use them consistently.

low-hormone, progesterone-only options are:

- Mirena or Skyla IUD
- Nexplanon arm implant.

Remember that the morning-after pill exists and is over the counter as well, if needed.

I'm not sure I understand why your parents would be so against an IUD--do they think it works by causing an abortion? (That's not how it works, FWIW, but I understand that you want to respect their views while they're providing for you).

"I completely understand. I'm gay. Me and pretty much every single gay person ever, has gone through this type of scenario when coming out. Unfortunately some gay people are disowned by their parents.

But these days? Most aren't disowned. Most parents come around on it. Even the fundamentalist parents who initially disowned their child. Because of love. Love powers through. For most parents, their love for their child is more powerful than their own disappointment, their culturally ingrained prejudices, and even their religion.

If they're truly the good and loving parents that you believe they are, then they'll come around. And if they don't? You can create your own family. With your boyfriend. Which is what you want to do anyway.

When you do break the news to them, make sure you have your own support system in place just in case of the worst. Your boyfriend, your friends, even a therapist. If you fear for your physical safety, do it in a public place, or even a letter if you must.

But you're just going to have to do it and stop letting the fear control your life."
"Yeah I think the fact that this was her bachelorette party makes it so much worse. Most of them are planned well in advance with lots of care... Did none of her friend think about getting home? Did OP not mention it? If not, it says a lot about how much she respects her SOs view on the matter. Further, as the bachelorette, she has all the say. It's her night. If she says 'lets call a cab' then it happens.

In short, the incident just showed how little OP seems to care about this issue. And that would be the biggest problem for me."
"""Is he courteous, gallant, kind, and overall looking out for your best interest? A guy who does this is unlikely to be stepping out on you.""

"Most of your hobbies sound a) fairly solitary and b) consumptive rather than creative. That isn't a problem, it just means that it's difficult to connect with people through them. If you're doing something as a group or team, like playing football or DnD or Ultimate Frisbee, there's an automatic connection there that lets you build friendships/conversations. Equally, if you have a hobby that is creative, then even if you're working with the same medium or in the same genre, your final product will be different, which allows for debate and discussion. 

I'd also ask, how many new guy friends are you making or trying to make right now? Because if you're only looking to talk to women you don't know while staying friends with the same dudes you've known in high school, it can come across as a bit desperate. Even if you're totally fine with the number of good friends you have, think of everyone as friend/girlfriend making practice. Push yourself to talk to new people, remember names, notice things about them and ask about it (but, like, obvious things, don't stalk their facebook pages back a couple of years and ask weird questions about that). A guy who is friendly with everyone who goes up to talk to a girl almost invariably gets a better reaction than the guy who spots a hot girl and goes and hits on her without talking to anyone else in the room. 

Most of all, I'd say to put yourself out there. If you like retro video games, see if there are ever arcade parties or nerdcore gigs near you. Go to the next costume party as a character from one of your favourite old school games. Chuck some badges on your bag. See if you can get a job controlling the crowd at your local comic book expo. 

I think it's less that your hobbies are so obscure and more that you don't put yourself out there enough. One of my friends is a poly dude, and the last two date night photos he posted were of him and one girlfriend making tiny cardboard spaceships (I assume for some bigger game, but I don't actually know) and him and another girlfriend at a Paper Scissors Rock tournament. He's the fucking champion of obscure/nerdy hobbies, and he has many partners. "
to say the least..... that is such a breach of trust on her/his part..... fucking awful

"You keep reposting this like you don't actually know it's bullshit. Some people have very serious and closely held boundaries when it comes to private matters. What you're saying when you say what matters most is whether it's helping her is that OP doesn't have a right to have his own boundaries, doesn't have a right to the privacy that's obviously important to him, if it contradicts the wife's questionable choice of a confidante.

"I think a considerate partner takes into account how their partner feels about their family, even if they love them. I like my boyfriend's family, but can't imagine inviting them out without running it past him. He knows I don't have a good relationship with my family and supports me through that and hasn't pushed to meet them (even though we've been dating more than a year and flew to the other coast to meet his last summer)."
"Would it be impossible to tell her you just want some me time instead of always going out together? 

My best friend and I were attached to the hip for several years before we realized we both have separate interests, views, and hobbies. If we kept spending so much time together we'd be dragging the other person to these things that they ultimately are ""meeh"" towards. So we slowly just winded down the hang outs and everything is okay. 

He did have a clingy stage where he got severely hurt/distant whenever I got into relationships. I had my own faults in it as well, but he cut me out of his life for several months before realizing that he made a mistake. We both saw our friendship kind of like a security blanket and when we both pulled away it stirred some drama. That may happen to you too, but it's for your own well being. True friendships with stick together in the long run. "
"And? Do you prefer the hose and the back porch? 

You have a great opportunity in your hands. This man chose you, not others from ""your"" world. You're 25, it's one of the best times to make a big life change. I know we are all afraid of change, but don't be. You have all the time in the world to change your mind later. 

Also, seriously consider this: you guys are married. Much of his motivation comes from wanting to do well for his own, possible, future family. Think about this from his point of view outside of just some simple career aspirations. 

Look, I am just a bit older than you at 26. Last year, I moved from Chicago to the country. I found a great job out here, and my environment is completely different from the big city. I hated some things about the city, so I thought it would make me happy to move. In either case, I found things that I hated about this place too. In the end, it's all in your head. 

You love this man. He loves you back. You guys are a team. You have to push each other to succeed. Your insecurities about moving will be quickly forgotten after the fact because they are just that, insecurities. I would say you should take the leap. Btw, you don't have to give up on your roots, just because you will get to experience some ""high society"". It's best to embrace both. "
"Next time he starts acting aggressive call the police and change the locks while he's gone. Rent a storage space for 1 month and move all of his shit out so he has no reason to come back. Block his number and social media.

"As a woman, my opinion is you should leave her sorry, abusive ass. I don't know if that helps you at all."
"I suggest that you google the Captain Awkward blog and read some posts there. They have lots of advice about how to take the pressure off when making friends or dating, and some of it is directed towards same sex. A search through their archives would do you good."
"You had sex with someone... That is not a bad thing. 
There's is nothing nasty about sex. "
"My ex often bought me stuff from the DollarTree or other cheap places, for most gifting events. Not even stuff I would like. For instance I don't like flowers, especially roses, but he bought me several (over the course of our relationship) of those cheap fabric roses that you see in gas stations. "
"Why would you put yourself back in her life?
This is so incredibly self-serving and selfish, you need to leave the poor girl alone.

She *ignored* you and you **tracked down her number while she was in the bathroom**. 

Read that back to yourself. 


You knew you were doing something sneaky and wrong because it was behind her back, after you emotionally fucked with her for years, and you're still okay with yourself as a human being? **You're one of those guys that has to tell everyone that you're nice.**


She gave you clear back off signals and you won't listen. You're creepy and overbearing and immature.

Since it doesn't seem like you'll listen to Ana, LEAVE HER ALONE. It'll be the only goddamn thing you do right in this relationship **that you no longer have, and it's all your fault.**"
"OK, I wrote a point-by-point answer, but it distills to this:

She is wildly irresponsible. She is appalling. She is a parasite. She has zero  self control.  She is horrid to you, and to your family. She is an unfit mother.

Solution: cut her out of your life, utterly, and call CPS."
"Yeah tbh even when I was in the ""get stupid drunk every night turn up lol fuck kidneys"" phase I never felt the need to get shitty with my s/o. Like, ever. I could maybe see this being okay if it was a one time thing but it sounds like it comes into effect *every time* she drinks. She needs to stop drinking because these are the beginnings of an abusive drunk. 

OP, you're 17. Cut your losses because regardless of how you look at it, she's either into this guy and only voices it when drunk or she's developing a serious alcohol problem. Either way you don't want that at 17. You can certainly try talking to her but at 17 it's probably just going to be dismissed as you being a party pooper. "
"Then you need to find a counselor or therapist. Because I agree you absolutely need to talk to someone, and it cannot be your ex. She cannot nurse you through your breakup."
"You are absolutely right. It took me a few hours to realize this. I was thinking, the ball is in her court. If she wants this to continue, then she needs to change. But that's wrong! If I want this to continue, then she needs to change and earn my trust. I've been afraid of losing her for months now, mainly because I sometimes get insecure (but my intuition was correct). Now, she needs to know that she could lose me and in fact, she already may have. She needs to work as hard as I did to keep me around."

"&gt;  but at the end of the day he is loyal to his brother not this woman who we both dislike.

Just because you don't like her doesn't mean she doesn't deserve to know he's using her and lying to her. "
He's an asshole. Who cares what he thinks he is. He's disrespectful and makes you feel bad. Why do you like being a doormat for this piece of shit?
"Woah woah

No parents until you've spoken to school management! Get some advice first. It's their responsibility that they've hired a shitty teacher, and you can't go around like you know better especially not in the teaching world it is so frowned upon, even if they are as shitty as you explain!! "
"Your parents swallowed their prideful righteous bullshit and are living their true faith, supporting your sister, bringing her bf into the family, and planning on assisting him in becoming a responsible parent. Reality vs. the doctrine of shame they distilled in you. Her sex life and etc. is not your business or responsibility. I am not devout and am pro-choice, btw. But I have to say it sounds like they are pretty badass in an situation they cannot control and have stepped up big-time. Sorry if your brainwashing is compelling  judgey bullshit in you and they haven't shunned her. Would that have made you happy?  People grow and change and in your parents case it seems for the better. 

I suspect you will change too, when you are uncle to a beautiful baby.

Unplanned pregnancy can ruin families. Your parents are not taking the low road.  I applaud them."
"We are talking about literally saying what they did wrong. What do you not understand about that?

For example: you invited your friend to our date. It was our date that we were meant to be spending together, and you invited someone else. 

Have you never had a conversation when you've told someone, honestly and in plain English, exactly what you mean?"
"Your fiancee's parents are horrible and unreasonable people, but they are not the problem. Your fiancee is the problem, and she's being a giant asshole by caving to their bigoted demands. If your best man was straight but married to a woman of a different race, and your future in-laws were racist, would your fiancee want to un-invite her to ""keep the peace""? ""Oh, sorry, you're a good friend, but I just can't have a black woman at my wedding. You understand.""

If your fiancee sticks to her guns on this and uninvites someone who has been a good friend to you both, and **who is married to your best friend** just because of his orientation, she is no better than city officials who block legal gay marriages. She's no better than people who bully gay teens into suicidal mental states, and she's no better than people who turn down gay job applicants just for being gay.

It can be difficult for people with controlling parents to break free of their spell, but if the two of you talk through this and she *still* fails to stand up for this kind of basic good v. evil shit, how can you even respect her or trust her as a life partner? "

"So yes, you need to leave him, but there are issues you need to have a good hard look at when you leave:

"" I try to be a great wife. I don't really get mad ever, I don't nag, and I'm pretty easy going. I do have anxiety issues that bother him a lot - I worry that he is okay/safe when I don't hear from him, I worry about stuff way more than him. I try to be as supportive and kind as possible and it's not enough.""

This is not the road to a happy relationship. You need to be willing to advocate for your needs and draw boundaries. You need to stop being willing to be perfect. You're making yourself small in order to accommodate your husband's ability to do whatever the heck he wants. No one responds to that with respect and appreciation. Abusers seek it out and cultivate it. But even if you act that way with a normal guy, you won't have a happy relationship. You have to be willing to stand up for yourself. High tolerance people actually have higher rates of divorce, because they tolerate bad behavior that they grow to resent or that becomes unsustainable. 

I'd hazard a guess that your parents were either alcoholics, abusive, or very controlling, because that kind of background produces people who see it as negative to have needs. You should seek therapy. It can help you bolster the courage to leave and become healthier in your relationship style."
"She's right.  She moved to your honetown, found a job in your hometown.  Now you want to move to the other side of the world, and she wants full on commitment from you.

My boyfriend and I do not drink at all and I understand how socially engrained the gift of booze is. We just add it to our stash of stuff to bring to dinner parties to look adult and organized. 
"I would say having a panic attack is an overreaction.  Do you get them regularly?  If so, that isn't normal and I suggest that you see a professional about dealing better with your stress and anxiety.

Second, no, this commute isn't reasonable.  I think the first thing to do is to figure out a way to reduce it.  How long was your commute with the carpool?  Could you maybe find another carpool to join, even for just part of it?  Could you get a cheap used car and drive yourself, then sell it once you don't need it anymore?  Could you find an internship closer to where you live?  

As for your boyfriend, is he usually supportive of you or does he often dismiss your feelings?  The putting in earplugs was a pretty shitty thing to do, definitely.  "
"I agree with ignoring it, but you should also file a police report. It couldn't hurt incase she tries to come after you legally for stalking her. "
"she does not want to be with you, dude. "
"Moment? MOMENT? A ""moment"" implies a a brief span of time, not years of you continuously choosing to put your ex first. The only thing Mike did wrong here was not break up with you sooner. You're legitimately a horrible, self-centered, delusional person.

Goddamn."
"I hate to jump to conclusions but hey, past behavior is a great predictor for future behavior. She's lied before, why not lie now? Maybe those aren't her work hours. Who's to say she only works 70 hour a week, and spends the excess 30 with the other guy? Using work as an alibi isn't unheard of."
Yeah... this guy is trying to manipulate and control you. Do what you want with your life. Don't let this guy keep you from achieving your dreams. 
"I'm willing to bet this right here is why people get rubbed the wrong way by you.

Everyone goes through shit in their lives. Being positive doesn't mean you smile about literally everything - you're allowed to be upset at things. Being positive means not fixating on the bad and trying to move forward with the good.

/u/PlannerDenammer and /u/turingtested made very good points, but all you do is ignore what they're saying while making excuses for yourself. It's annoying to everyone and negativity like that breeds negativity.

Do you really think that you're the only one on Earth who would be in their 30s changing careers? Or that there's literally no hobbies that aren't fulfilling without people? Hell I go camping and hiking by myself, drag my camera along, and for work I program. All are things I do by myself and all I consider fulfilling. And do you really think that out of everyone with a stable job, you're the only one with a bad childhood? Go trawling through Reddit stories and you'll hear plenty of people from abusive backgrounds, low socioeconomic families, in and out of prison, etc. who managed to turn their life around.

Negativity invites negativity, and your habit of wallowing in self pity while making excuses is likely the reason why you get so much crap in your life. "
"It took you a second to realise you were kissing someone who's not your boyfriend and instead off telling him to piss off, you stayed and talked to him long after and you're debating keeping this from you're SO? If i was you're SO and i found you kept this from me and kept a guy that has zero respect for our relationship in your life, it would be over in an instant."
"I'm sorry but this sounds fishy as all hell and my advice to you is to cover your own ass before you do anything.

You need to work out what position you're in, in terms of marital assets and figure out what you would do if the marriage broke up. This is going to take time.

In an ideal world sure you'd ""confront"" him but the reality is that if he *is* cheating, seeing prostitutes or whatever, then you'd just be giving him a head start. If he's dishonest (and it really sounds like he is - a lie of omission is still a lie, even if you let him get out of it on a ""technicality"") then he won't fight fair when it comes to divorce, so you need to be prepared."
A doctor I know had a destination wedding with his second wife.  I got the impression that they wanted to keep it small and private.  Perhaps they wanted to keep their exes out of the picture.  His ex wife was a real piece of work.
"Ignore, block, delete.  You've made your decision, stick to it.

In the future though, don't do that whole break bullshit.  It is selfish to tell someone you don't want to be with them yet expect them to wait around for you to make a decision.

He was not wrong for sleeping with the rando and you are not wrong for breaking up with him.  Let it be.

&gt;Also if he's gone and slept with someone the day after we went on a break, he can't be too invested in the relationship.

On the other hand, if you are going on breaks with him, you cannot be too invested either."
Birth defects can be a harmless extra toe or incompatibles with life and a world in between. That one on thirty three is a little misleading.

"&gt;saying her ex husbands suicide was her fault etc

Jesus, I missed that. Just found it now. That's *horrendous.* 

Yeah, OP - I know you love him. But it seems like he has a very nasty tendency to lash out at those closest to him and it sounds as though you're not immune to this. I was already thinking you would benefit from some distance from him (though I was concerned it might be difficult as I had the impression you live together, not sure if that was correct.) I now think that's crucial. You love him; he's done a lot for you -- that does not mean you are responsible for all his problems, let alone to blame for them. It's good of you to commit to getting him to therapy; once that is done STEP BACK. I'm not saying cut ties, but you won't be doing him any favours by letting him make you his additional therapist or his emotional punching bag. "

"Exactly my thoughts. Why can't SHE be the one to organize and surprise you with a trip when she knows you have off-work time?

Also, I still think it's pretty silly to organize surprise trips without talking together about times and costs. *Unless* it's somewhere she knows you really really wanted to go for a long time, but doesn't seem the case here."
She had sex. Unprotected sex.
"I can't agree more. However hard that might be, you have a life as well.

"Considering the two of you are both cheaters, I don't really think you have much room to be whining about him being a manipulator. 

Either way, deal it with and mind your own business. Stop reveling in this bullshit. I mean really? You're sad for his wife? Just get over yourself and move on. "
"&gt; Your mom is testing to see if she still has control over you, CLEARLY she does.

"Have the other trips had ""dream trip"" importance to him? If not, you're probably right that he would be more on edge if this trip is significantly more important to him. I still think avoiding the ""six people are ganging up on you because we want to change your dream trip"" isn't going to go over well (hence why he's will to just do his own thing solo and you all can plan your own itinerary ""IF"" you want to). I mean, I get where you're coming from, but the message you're hearing from him is ""this is what I want to do, I did all of the planning for this, if you don't want to do that, do your own damn thing"" right now. You basically rejected his entire plan and said ""Go fix this so it's more accommodating for us"".

I think you've got two choices, either let him go solo and the rest of you plan your own more laid back itinerary that you prefer, or agree to go with him using his itinerary and raise specific points with it. Like, if you plan on a 30m lunch at a remote location when there will be hundreds of other tourists all waiting to get something from the single cafe there at the same time, raise that. Or maybe switching a couple of things on the schedule will give the group more flexibility. Like, go visit the hotsprings via an Uber after checking into the nearby airbnb in the evening, instead of exactly between 1:36PM and 2:53PM between buses, and that will give you another hour to explore the previous item on the itinerary that friend #4 is really interested in."

"Just imagine if she said to you ""sometimes I forget your a guy"". Come on, you really don't know why that touched a nerve? 
She's probably insecure of the fact that she enjoys more ""masculine"" things, and her boyfriend commenting on how much of a tomboy she is probably isn't helping. 

I completely understand your view though - you were friends for years, had that kind of relationship for a very long time, even while you were dating. Now years into the relationship your learning she's upset by this, and its hard when she's doing the things you do with your ""boys"" like xbox and fantasy football, to see her as particularly feminine and girly.

"&gt; It just made me confirm any doubts I had about ending it and made me really sad to know even if we wanted to keep it, it might not have been the right choice.

On top of all of the advice on how to talk to your partner, OP, it's important to remember that if there was no development of the embryo, there was likely no option to ""keep it"" to begin with. Do some googling of anembryonic gestation if you'd like to read more about it at some point. Having an abortion was the healthiest, wisest thing you could've done. 

More than 50% of pregnancies spontaneously abort in the first 6 weeks of pregnancy for reasons exactly such as this one. This often happens before a woman even knows she was pregnant in the first place.

None of that is to say that your loss isn't a ""real"" loss-- of course it is, and mourning the loss is perfectly natural and normal. Your anxiety is surely through the roof given the hormonal whirlwind you are experiencing, too. 

My partner and I have an agreement for times like these: ""One at a time. First you, then me."" Only one of us is allowed to freak out at a time. If it's his turn, I have to be the rock. I am responsible for holding my own anxiety off for a little while to tend to his and support him while he processes through the issue. Then, we switch. This way someone always has the bigger picture in mind while the other can break down and work through the rough feelings with the other's unconditional, steady support. We go back and forth with that until the storm passes and we feel capable of being human again.

This is your boyfriend's time to be the steady partner. 

You will heal. This will pass. It will get better, I promise. "

"This would be more than just a couple grand. It sounds like the parents agreed to split the responsibility for the $15k and each pay back half, so there is at least 7500 there.

It is really a very small and simple ceremony and we want it to keep it small and simple, quiet and about us. Hovewer, you will be the only not-familly guest, and we would like to keep it that way. Is this okay?
Something less or more subtle like this? Also you guys might want to ask him to keep it small as you dont wanna make a big deal of it.

"OP's wife (If you can see this),

Run, girl! This guy is controlling you and it's only going to escalate, run! "
"OK, so a couple of things are possible, and there are options for you, options for her, and options for the both of you.

For her? Painful sex usually isn't normal, so it's something she could discuss with her gynecologist and work on a diagnosis and course of action. She may require more foreplay, a much slower pace at the start, and not be one for vigorous penetration. 

For you? It sounds like you might be thinking of ""sex"" in terms of ""the man penetrates the woman's vagina with his penis"", and while that's true, it's pretty exclusionary of a lot of other fun sexual acts. Consider what elements are necessary and sufficient for you to call something ""sex"". Does it have to involve penetration of the penis into the vagina? Does it have to involve penetration of some orifice? Does sex have to involve both partners having orgasm? Simultaneously? Is it important to have skin contact, to be close, to show affection?

One possibility is that because you're not seeing each other often, the distance and waiting creates a certain pressure to perform. Feeling like you *must* have sex, rather than *wanting* sex, can be a real libido-killer. What would happen if (per the last paragraph) you eased your expectations of what ""sex"" was? How would your partner react if you said ""I don't need penis-in-vagina sex every time, but it's important that we're close, that we touch and try to make each other feel good and enjoy each other in a sensual way. I would like to have an orgasm, but there are lots of ways to do that."" 

All of this is assuming that your partner has a relatively normal sex drive and enjoys sexual stimulation. There's also a possibility that this person is *asexual*, that they don't feel sexual urges and don't really enjoy sexual stimulation. If that's the case, it's still important for you to figure out what aspects of sex are important to you, so that you can identify activities that meet your needs without putting an undue burden on her. If she enjoys giving you pleasure, and it's important that you two are physically close, oral sex and cuddling might fit the bill. 

The thing the both of you have to do is *talk more*. Do your own homework first, and be ready to talk about what works and what doesn't work, what she's comfortable doing and what she enjoys, and negotiate something that works for both of you. "
"Since no one else had said it,  *no this is not normal behavior*. Begging, crying and trying to pressure you into things you don't want to do on a semi-daily basis are not normal behaviors even for ""baby fever""."

&gt;Up until her boyfriend [19?/M] got jealous. Now, don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and I'm a joker, but I always saw her as a little sister

This is a load of crap, and if you keep trying to convince yourself, and the people around you, that you ""saw her as a little sister,"" despite trying to maintain a relationship that not only her boyfriend, but SHE was uncomfortable with (judging by the fact that she had to block you), you're just going to end up looking like a loser. Grow up and find someone your own age. 

Edit: And judging by your post history, you also have a girlfriend, which makes this whole thing even worse. "
"I wouldn't block her in case she has questions. If I were her and the girl blocked me immediately after messaging me it would drive me crazy. I would have so many questions. Either she will be defensive and side with him (she will want to believe him) or she will confide in you and you will have helped her dodge a complete bullet. I mean imagine if this girl ended up marrying him? Potentially wasted life with a lying cheat. My advice is to tell her the truth as delicately as you can. Leave out unnecessary hurtful details, but definitely say your peace. Good luck."

"All the therapy in the world isn't going to give him a total personality transplant.

He's a selfish, lying, lazy man that openly takes advantage of you as much as possible. You're his maid, accountant, mother and cook that he gets to have sex with. 

Save your money so you can move out and get a divorce. There are men out there that don't cheat, and treat you with respect as an equal partner. That go out of their way to do extra just to make you happy. Like, if my boyfriend knows I have an extra busy day, I'll come home and find that he's my chores for me! I never ask for this, he just does it to lighten my load. Men like him exist. "
"I would maybe wait until you hear her voice from downstairs and then go down and knock, that way you know she's home. Leaving a note wouldn't be all too terrible of an idea -- that would be my second choice. If it comes down to it, go to the landlord. Definitely express, in a kind manner, how it is disturbing you. Also let them know that when this was your situation, you did everything you could to make sure your dog was taken care of. I'm sure other neighbours are just as bothered. There's also a strong chance there will be neighbours that won't be so kind about the situation."
"If she didn't think it was cheating, she wouldn't have opened with ""I didn't want to tell you this tonight""; she would have casually mentioned at some point, not realizing it was A Big Deal.

This kind of thing shouldn't even be up for discussion. Even if they are friends, they are also people who are involved with each other. So you would think flying to spend the week with that person kind of would be an automatic no no.

The fact it isn't mean she either has still has feelings for him, or not enough basic respect for you to act like this. Either way, I think this relationship is doomed."
"he said he finds it creepy, why would he want to go for it?"
"&gt; his parents weren't fond of me

"I no longer work there. 

They were Organized shoplifting rings. They were selling stolen product to drug dealers. We knew they were a family, they would all come in and steal, and we needed to know if there was others in their family doing the same thing. 

LP were licensed PIs, and I didn't control them, the head of LP of our company had them doing it. Not me, the problem was larger than our store, so the big guns got called in

LP found the families doing it, and the drug ring as well. We turned over everything, and the local PD made several dozen arrests.

I was just in the office every morning when they would call their boss, so I would hear their report. "
"This! OP, you are 21. Relationships should not be this hard work."
Stop lying to your boyfriend. It's not fair.
Would she be telling OP what the PI was finding though? You'd think she would stay quiet about the whole thing if it was her plan to keep investigating. 
"Not really, no. We live pretty far away and not surprisingly they don't really go out of their way to be involved, and I don't care enough to involve them. I got really lucky in that when I got married my wife's family basically adopted me. We live near them, they went to all my kid's stuff growing up and are still pretty involved in their lives. My bio-family and I exchange pleasantries on holidays and that's pretty much the way I like to keep it. 

To be clear, I'm not still angry or trying to ""punish"" them. I just decided 20 years ago that I was done caring. I realized as I was starting my own marriage that my anger and resentment towards my parents was only going to eat me away inside if I let it. And if I did that it was going to interfere with how I raised my own kids because, well let's face it - if I'm consumed by this anger of my own, then I'm falling into the exact same narcissistic habits as my parents and making everything about me. I was ultimately going to do to my kids in some way what they did to me. Fuck that. My wife used to ask me how I could be civil with them - how I could forgive them. I finally made her understand that I didn't really forgive them - more important things came along (her, her family, our kids) and I simply stopped caring about being important to them.  I don't really think about them, don't send cards on fathers or mothers day, speak civilly when they call at Christmas, acknowledge my ""Happy Birthday"" text message once a year, and basically forget about them the rest of the year.

"This could be me, but we choose to have a child.
Having a child is a wonderful thing, but it is also a horrible thing.
We got a child a little bit earlier, I am 31 (m) and our daughter is 3 years old.
I really miss my DINK life. I love my daughter but at the same time I just miss my former life.
I have near to no time for myself any more.
Our daughter behaves nice and sleeps until ~8am which is very late (friends have a daughter, she is up at 5.30-6.00 every day! Cannot image this), but there is so much time consume with having a child.
She is in daycare because my wife wants to work and that is even more time consuming, because we/I have to get up early to dress feed her and drive her to day care and then the traffic is worse because it is later. I need 1,5 hours more in the morning because of that. And it is not like its quality time, just feeding, making food package and get her to daycare. I could sleep 2 hours more and be in the same time at work without a kid.
I sound resenting, but it's not really. I love my daughter and I had so much good times with her. I would choose to be a father again, but no second kid. I also ""happy"" if she gets older and get friends, become a teen and sleepover, own hobbies. It makes me sad thinking about it, but thats life I think.
But to conclude, I was never ready. 
I think a lot of parents have thoughts like this.
But they rarely speak about this, because you know having kids is fun and great. All the time! Or you are a bad parent.

So think hard about it. You will choose a lot of years doing what the kid wants not what you want."
"&gt; I told him I'm sad because I thought we would build a life together here and his response was ""How do I respond to that?"" :(

"Feed her! If you think the relationship is worth saving, love her with food. I am chronically under weight because I often forget to eat. My mood tanks when I've missed a meal. I have had to set alarms on my phone to remind me to eat (and drink water too). So far it has helped. I have gained enough weight so I'm not always flirting with starving all the time. As a result the mood swings have greatly reduced. You mentioned she just had a birthday? Maybe you can give her another belated birthday present (maybe say you noticed she missed her family) and stock up her cupboards and fridge. I'm Dr. Jekyll when I'm fed and Mr. Hyde when I'm starving. Depression may also be a factor but the food will take the edge off things. Good luck. "

"This is a very simple case that does not at all have anything to do with whether your ex has something called Sexual Desire Disorder or not.  She doesn't want to be with you enough to be in an exclusive relationship.  It does not matter what the reasons are.  The fact that she is bringing in some weird excuse should only give you more reason to accept and move on.  She is not worth it.

"This will most likely go down in flames. Why is it you think that once you get married he will all of a sudden accept being forced into celibacy if he's ""hyper-sexual""? He's going to resent you for never wanting to have sex with him, and you're going to resent him for always badgering you to do something that is against your nature. Having sex with other people is not a replacement for having sex with the person you're in love with, and you run the risk of him falling in love with one of these women that he's sleeping with and finds that he's more compatible with. Because what you just described, is a complete and fundamental lack of compatibility. Besides, you're so young and going into the military. As a child of two military vets, experience tells me that even if you were compatible the chances of this marriage lasting are pretty slim. "

"I was married at 22, separated at 25, finally able to divorce at 28. I felt absolutely humiliated too, though there was no religious aspect. I am now 31 and 18 months ago, met the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. I'm telling you this because even though your life is not turning out the way you expected, it could turn out to be even better.

"How much parenting responsibility do you have for your stepson? It sounds like you're trying to step into a role that doesn't exist.

His mom has raised him one way, and you want to come in and change that. It's great to encourage him to try something new, but you tried to blackmail him into it and his mom took away your leverage. 

I would try changing your approach and see if there's some activity that the two of you can do together. Like refereeing classes. Can you say, ""Hey, I'm taking X class and I want you to take it with me"" and then sign up together?"
You guys are still so young and it's terrific that you're having these (safe and fun!) adventures together. The boyfriend is a giant wet blanket and I hope your friend never allows him to hold her back. 
"I'd ask him. Ask to see the messages. Don't prolong anything, it's just giving him time to delete and get craftier if he is being unfaithful. One of my exes cleverly changed all the women he was cheating on me with to names of his close friends like Dylan, Matthew, etc."

It's never okay, she'll do it again, and although I know it is easier for men to do real physical damage with they hit a woman than the other way around it is still wholly unacceptable and actually a crime.  There is no way to have a good and healthy relationship with an abuser. End of story.  Break it off with her and get help with your depression.  You are your number one priority and you can't get better with someone treating you like shit.  "

"Hi, OP. I am much like you in that I am 32 years old and hardly ever drove until a few weeks ago. I spent a few hours in parking lots with my husband, but never felt confident enough to go further than that. 

I would *highly* recommend finding the money for a 10-hour driving course, even if you have to put it on credit for now. Working with a trained instructor was a completely different experience than driving with family/friends and was much more productive. There is comfort in knowing that your passenger has training expertise and has control of the car that allows you to relax, learn and start to develop muscle memory."
"No, it stands.  Why should he have to text you while he's at a party to let you know he's thinking of you? That's needy and insecure.  

HE told you he was going to another person's house and you still attempted to intrude with valentine's plans to pull focus from his night... onto you and your relationship.  

And then you picked a fight. It doesn't matter that you used your ""sweetest voice"".  When you start chastizing someone for how they are treating you, you are picking a fight. 

So no, all the comments stand.  You just refuse to accept you are in the wrong and want everyone to tell you how terrible it is that he doesn't feed your ego constantly.  "

"Dump his ass, and get with someone who:

- Someone who actually respects you. You deserve respect.
- Is not a hypocrite. 80 people? But you're a slut? He can't be serious.

You don't deserve to feel the way he makes you feel. If you are having safe, consensual sex, it doesn't fucking matter. He sounds like a jackass, OP. Fuck that guy."
"When a man tries to put a cap on how many men a woman can sleep with, it's born out of either sexual or social insecurity then vast majority of the time. I would also doubt his 80+ number, as men who put a cap on how many men a woman can have sex with also frequently lie about the number of people they slept with. 

Look up slut shaming. A woman can and should have as much sex as she wants or is comfortable with, and 15 is a perfectly respectable number. If he can't accept that, it sounds like his problem. "
Do you plan on having kids with him? Because my husband saying that kind of bullshit to my daughter would have me in fits.

By getting mad about it. ""I have told you to stop. This is your last warning; the next time you make a joke about my weight we're ending this. You're showing me you have no respect for my feelings."" Make it clear that this is the line in the sand you're drawing and you don't care if he thinks it's stupid.

You have to wonder why your boyfriend continuously enjoys doing a thing that makes you cry. My guess is that he's actually serious but doesn't know how to communicate that."
"Let me get this straight, youngest bro is 15? Are any of the other kids under 18 or in college/uni? Because if not she is only entitled to a very small amount of child support, and child support is rarely enough to support even one child, let alone a family.


Giving her money directly is enabling her to continue to be reckless and irresponsible. If her youngest is 15 she does not need to be home full time (unless he has major disabilities or something?). (Not that staying home isn't a valid CHOICE, it's just one that isn't available to everyone, and isn't available to her anymore.) She needs to get a job. Why the hell can't she watch children again? Childcare is usually a seller's market.


Anyway, I think the support you should give to your mom can be emotional (not that she'll acknowledge or appreciate it) and logistical (help her put together a skills-focused resume, put up posters for her new home daycare if she opens one, connect her with retraining programs for women reentering the workforce, offer to take in your brother temporarily if she needs space to figure out her situation, etc) but not financial. She is 100% an adult and is responsible for herself. Don't let her guilt you into being her next victim."

"You are, not so subtly, asking *whether or not you should dump your boyfriend*.

I'm not specifying that you would necessarily **cheat** on him. You could just break up with him. You could just break up with whatever current SO you have whenever you get a new crush. So, in the example above, you could be married 50 years and *WHAM* a new crush, and then you'd break up with your husband?

That's what I'm talking about - if you can't control your impulses, then don't get into a relationship.

I think you are trying to ask if these 'feelings' you are having are indicative of having found your 'soul mate' or some other such thing - **they aren't**. You have *a crush*. It's *physical and that's it*."
"Whoa. That's a pretty quick timeline, which is typically pretty concerning in a relationship. Regardless, her words may have been that she is ready to settle a little more but her actions say otherwise. 

You've got very valid concerns and you guys really need to talk this out. You can't control what she does, but this type of disagreement really takes a toll on a relationship. I recommend holding off on any wedding planning and really work this out. She's getting something of value from her friendship, whether it's excitement or feeling needed. She needs to figure out what that is, and you need to figure out if it's a deal-breaker for you. "
"This is a problem your wife is going to need help in dealing with.  She seems to have sort of separation anxiety issues.  It's NOT normal for a person to be angry and hate when their partner is out of the house.  That's controlling and borderline abusive.

I wouldn't be surprised in the least if this woman is setting up a situation where she uses OP's boyfriend as a sperm donor, then absconds off with the baby and another man. She can use the other man as the ""legal"" father and throw a pat suit against the ""bio"" father at her leisure; both men could be held liable for child support.

I remember those ridiculous double standards. And being told that I was a burden, and lucky to have him.

Do you also feel guilty or scared about the idea of telling real people in your life about what's going on, because you're afraid of ""turning them against him""? Or has he already convinced you that anybody who doesn't criticize you to the same degree ""doesn't really care about you"", and that anybody who criticizes *him* ""hates him"" and needs to be cut out of your lives? 

Tell someone. A friend, a family member, someone in your real life. You don't have to jump to the decision of leaving him. It's clear that you're not  in that place yet. You're not Done. But tell someone. Start talking about these problems with someone who knows you and cares about you.  "

"Why won't you call the police if she's threatening suicide? 

She needs professional help.  She's not in any condition to see this need herself.  Her mom needs to help her.  NOT YOU. 


Personally, I think it's unprofessional of the counselors to keep roping you in.  


For now, just mute her on your phone so it's not blowing up all the time.


**Source:** I have 3 friends like your friend (but not as bad).  

*First Friend:* She refused to see a counselor saying I was all she needed, as she also didn't have other friends.  With her, I finally said, ""Sorry, I don't have any more solutions than the ones I've already given you. Have you tried seeing a counselor?"" when she said no, I said ""ok, sorry, I've got no more ideas, good luck!

*Second Friend:* Alcohol &amp; depression, would call me crying. She was receptive to therapy, so it worked.


*Third Friend:* Alcohol, Depression, and a Mental Illness.  Refusing to take her meds, driving drunk, posting weird stuff on Facebook and Whats app.  Husband was enabling her. Unclear if her doctor knew what she was doing.  She was crying to other friends and forcing them to leave work early to console her.  I set boundaries.  If she emailed/texted me, I would wait 1-2 hours.  Then reply, ""So sorry, just saw this. Sorry to hear you're feeling this way.  Sounds like it would be really helpful for you to talk to a therapist.  Please let me know if you need my help to call one.  Love you, bye.""  (Notice how I ended with Love you.  It's a classic manipulation technique for them to say you don't love them.  By ending with Love you, it neutralizes this comment).


Hang in there, OP. Let me know if you need more suggestions on how to reply."
"I am a little confused here. Yes he told you to eat, yes he pressured you, but you are the one that put the food in your mouth, unless he force fed you, you have some responsibility here. If you didn't like what he was saying to you, pressuring you, comparing you to celebrities, you should have sat him down and told him ENOUGH ALREADY. 

So I would say your lesson here is two fold: take responsibility for your actions, but also don't tolerate this type of blatant manipulation from other people, whether he ""meant"" it or not is kind of beside the point. 

&gt;he is very bad at conveying his own emotion/sarcasm when he speaks, and often flat out lies (but again believes other people can assume his intentions are exact opposite of what he has said).

Why do you stay with someone whose communication skills are *SO BAD?*

And don't get down to 95lbs again. Find a healthy you that you are happy with and don't let anyone take that away from you again."
"Your last paragraph is especially good advice. But even if OP doesn't care what the friends think, it still might be an uncomfortable situation to walk into a room of people who basically have reason to despise her, only because of the fact that one of them might say or do something that is out of line. I don't think it's likely that anybody would, but I can understand being apprehensive about it."
"For now. Ultimately the hate will start to negatively impact your life and you'll want to seek forgiveness (to forgive her), which is something you may never be able to do. I'd strongly suggest start seeing a therapist."
"Nope, not yet. 

"
"Wow you are not a nice person...why is he even with you? You dont want a functioning independent human you want a lap dog and you got it...no you got buyers remorse. You need therapy ASAP. Everything about this post screams "" i need therapy """
You're a bit older than them so maybe a bit intimidating. (than and the fact there are probably a few orbiters in the pack &gt;:D).
"Is he deaf or delusional?

Don't write the letter, don't send the card. Don't let them relish in their delusions of being good parents when clearly, they are not.

Alternatively you could write a nice eff you, see you next Tuesday and send it."
"Yeah, after six years, you should have some idea if you want to be with this person in the long run or not. Sounds like he doesn't want to be tied down while being long distance, but he still wants her on the hook, or something. Either make a commitment or don't, but don't be surprised when she's not OK with that. And if a guy wasn't willing to commit to me after SIX YEARS, I'd figure it's time to move on."

"Another Dork here - I'm an event planner and do it for 'fun' as well. 

Do you see how the group's actions are actually negating the feeling of love? 


1) First you say we'll be ok with whatever Dork wants, so Dork - you be the one to do all the research and work to plan it out.

2) After Dork does it, then ya'll come back with - looks good but now we want wiggle room. 


This is hugely insulting - and a waste of his time.  


The least one of you can do is start booking accommodations - do not add one more thing on his plate.


Secondly, have a meeting, and each person should take ownership for one day to ensure the accommodations are booked, travel is set, you have the maps,  - all the logistics. (Now and the day of)  I suspect all of you were going to show up and make Dork be your tourguide.  That isn't fair.


While I get that all of you are just excited to be in Iceland, you need to take more ownership of the logistics.  Dork may enjoy the research, but he's probably not enjoying the logistics.


Good luck!"
"&gt;our joint account 

Why on earth did you ever agree to a joint account in the first place? I'm a firm believer that only people who are married should have joint accounts for all of the reasons you mentioned. Legally, your money is now also his mother's money. Bad move.

Is he responsible for his mom? Like, is he the oldest and she can't work? Does she need medical help? Even then, there are other ways she can get assistance. I see absolutely no reason for her to have access to any of his money and the fact that he's fighting you on this is probably more to make a point then actual logistics. As in he's pushing back because you're implying his crazy mom is...well...crazy.

If he won't do the responsible thing and take his mother out of the account, *remove yourself* from the joint account. When he's ready to be rational, you can add him to yours or you can both open up a separate joint account *without* his mother."
"You could definitely go to the Dean or the head of the department. Gather evidence first. Maybe have your phone recording for a few days and see if you can catch another of his outbursts on tape. His behavior is definitely inappropriate. Unfortunately, he is in a position of power over you, but if you can prove that he is verbally abusing you and making an ass of himself in front of the class, the Dean or department head may be able to do something about it. If the lab manager is willing to back you up, all the better. Oh, and if he damages expensive equipment by just being a hothead, try to get record of that too. 

What do you say when he apologizes? I don't think it would be completely out of line to respectfully ask that if he must yell at you, to please do so in private and not in front of a class full of students. I would rehearse the wording, make it sound as respectful as possible. You don't want to get fired over this, but that doesn't mean you should be treated like shit. "
"Why did you get married at 21 to a 36 year-old?!  WTF, dude?  And now you're living with her father?  How did this even happen?  How old were you when you and her started dating?  "
"If you're still at the stage in your life where you're looking to a relationship with somebody else to prove to the world that you aren't still a kid, you are still a kid."
"You're seeing them put their best foot forward. You said you used to take lovely photos together too, right? But the reality was a bit different? So how do you know that he's not being just as horrible to her &amp; she just hasn't had the courage to get out of it yet? You don't. You're just looking at some pictures &amp; imagining their perfect life together. 

You're looking at this entirely the wrong way. Instead of saying, ""He was an asshole, &amp; I deserve to be with someone that's not an asshole,"" you're twisting it into, ""The asshole found a new girlfriend... what does she have that I don't that she can hold onto the asshole?"""
"I mean... I don't want to defend the BF in this situation, because I think his reaction isn't the most healthy behavior. But you have to realize that your level of confidence and maturity aren't the norm. I think calling OP's post ""weird"" isn't helpful, because someone else might read your comment and think you're the weird one. 

""Weird"" is ostracizing. If someone is upset, you don't call them overly sensitive and walk away. OP needs help approaching this situation with compassion and understanding, not a black-and-white diagram of who is right and wrong."
They're embarrassed of their son's behavior and know that it's wrong. They'd rather have you hurt than have their shame exposed to the community - don't let them control you!

Seriously. Write them a letter saying as much or as little as you want of your reasons, but end this, today, no handover, no negotiation, no guilt.

"It's one thing for you to feel uncomfortable talking to this ""life coach"" because of the lack of training, accountability, etc.  But I think you're going a bit too far being upset that your wife goes.  It's totally valid for her to talk to anyone about her own private business, and your marriage is fair game for her to talk about.  

Now, it's one thing if this person is some kind of quack, pretending to be a therapist with no license and trying to scam people.  That would be a major sign that this person has no ethics and shouldn't be trusted.  But if the life coach is clear and up front about being a life coach and not a therapist, and your wife (not having serious problems that need a qualified professional to treat them) didn't care, I don't see the problem."
"&gt;Once got 120ish iq a few months back and 62nd percentile which was done while recovering from a concussion. But im usually kind of lonely. But i do realize that loneliness is a consequence of intelligence.

r/iamverysmart

This whole thing was a bit cringy, but either way, you've developed a crush. Absolutely normal, people constantly develop crushes on people they don't actually know but just see around.

Try to talk to her or get to know her first, don't jump into the whole ''I decare my eternal love for you'' thing.

&gt;Not so much fucking but just intellectually and emotionally entering each others worlds and talkibg for hours on end.

You don't even know her. You are just imagining that she's someone you'd want to be with and are living in this fantasy. 

You're in love with your idea of her. Stop admiring who you think she might be and actually get to know her. "
Does it say anywhere that he's contributing to the rent or the bills? I didn't see it.
"So in new York you're right, you can't order someone else's criminal record. Honestly? Tell him this is bothering you and in order for you to have peace he needs to order his criminal records so you can see them. That does a couple things. 1. It opens up the lines of communication. You want him to be honest right? So be honest with him about how this is bothering you. 2. It'll be easy to gauge if he's lying. If he's being honest with you he'll order them. My partner had a rough young adulthood that led to being incarcerated more than once (no sexual crimes though). He fully disclosed that early on (month or so) and if I needed to see his records he'd order them. And he did the crimes lol. Anyone that's innocent will order them for your peace of mind. Tbh I'd think he'd have ordered them already just to prove he's being honest. But force his hand. If he refuses, you know he's lying yet again. That should be enough proof to leave. 

Also I saw you said he's got an upcoming court date. That means he's still on probation. If he hasn't been honest about that, it's just more proof that he'll hide his shady deeds. Is that really the kind of partner you want? You're signing up to play detective forever if that's what you choose. "
He's really not that tough if he has to bully his partner with food to prove it.
Why would you want to be with anyone on that list period? 
"Haha, but if you went out and actually got that manicure, and your husband was like ""How was your day? What did you do?"" you might mention it, right? The fact that you haven't done it in a while would make it more likely that you tell him about it."
"Just food for thought. If they were making an unplanned stay in a distant town, perhaps he was buying simple toiletry items like contact supplies, toothbrush, etc?"
"Your mom doesn't want to pay out of his estate. 

How is the financial situation looking?  I don't get it. Did he specifically set aside a set number for you? Is the money from his estate just being split equally? 

His estate should pay the car off, and whatever is leftover should be split equally between the family. 

I'm assuming that she wants more money for herself, which is why she is going to split up his estate and then give you the car to pay off with your share so she doesn't have to?

How long until the money processes through? Is there a lawyer mediating this process? "
"I'm going to give you a piece of advice from another sub ""better to dump a Mummy's Boy than divorce one"". While it's easy to be frustrated with her, she is only a symptom of the problem. You have a BF problem, he needs to draw some boundaries stat. This wil not get better until he does, can you see yourself married and dealing with this until she dies? Because until he grows a shiny new spine, that will be your life."
"Dude, your arguments are great, but she is just looking for a way out. None of her arguments make any sense, there are so many possible solutions but she wants to take a very easy way. 
My bet is she has her eyes on another guy already...."
"I did. You should see a therapist. You might love your girlfriend for other reasons too, but getting hung up on her looking better at that age is not healthy or normal. It will only get worse with time, because that's how aging works. "
"Personally, I would book a package of lessons with a credit card, that way you get the best price.

And I wouldn't feel too bad about ""getting in debt"" because 1) it's a necessary skill you're going to need and 2) it's an investment in your career.

When you are working, you will quickly pay that off.  It's usually a couple hundred $$, depends on where you live.

It seems pretty obvious to me, so I assumed you didn't have that option available to you."
Make an appointment with a divorce attorney first thing Monday morning.
I feel like it's a bit strange. How serious are you with the guy you're seeing?
"Don't set yourself on fire to keep him warm. Next time he threatens suicide, call the police and tell them he's threatening to kill himself. 

With that age gap though, I'm guessing he's using the threat to keep you in line and so you don't leave. My ex did the exact same thing. That's why he's not telling his therapist, because if he actually wanted help he would seek it from a professional, not his 9 years younger girlfriend of one year that he's in a hurry to lock down. I suggest going to loveisrespect.org and see if you're actually in a healthy relationship.

Oh and when I finally left my awful ex who claimed he couldn't live without me and would kill himself, he immediately found some other woman to latch onto. People like this are manipulative and horrible leeches. Even if he does kill himself, it is not your fault. Step back and think about yourself dating a 17 year old and how predatory it would be, and how easy it would be to manipulate due to the younger person's inexperience. That's what he's doing to you. 

Take care of yourself. You cannot save this guy from himself, but you can save yourself from him. "
"&gt; I know it sounds harsh, but the academic world doesn't care about you personally.

Yeah academia is littered with assholes. But that doesn't mean you have to *be* one. OP, don't let this discourage you. Work hard and don't give her any reason to criticize you unfairly. That way, when she lashes out at you, it will come off as irrational on her part. Your hands will be clean from this."
"You really need to sit down with your in-laws and bf and tell them that your parents are not going to be supportive and you are afraid that if you tell them now you're going to get kicked out. I'm sure they want to tell everyone, but this isn't about them."
How exactly would you suggest ghosting a relative that you (presumably) see at family get-togethers?
"OK, let's get some basic things laid out.

First, you are **not** responsible for her health or safety. She's an adult. She picks who she hangs out with and what she does. You are not her mother, her guardian, or her big sister. She wants to stay with the ex-con and bang him, it's her call.

Next, if this person *wants* to move back in, before they do, you need to both sit down and agree to a written agreement about who pays what, what chores are expected, and how common areas of the home will be used. Google ""roommate agreements"" if you need a starting point, but basically, some people really do need to see, in writing ""used condoms need to be thrown away, and should not be left on the furniture, floor, or other surfaces"". 

Buy a couple of lock-boxes. One for your stash, another for your personal papers. (birth certificate, social security card, etc.) If you have anything you don't want a roommate getting in to, put it under lock &amp; key. If you *want* to share your weed, have a separate tin to put in the living room. 

Get your key back ASAP. Like, 24-48 hours tops, before you go to the landlord and say you need new keys and will pay for the locksmith. 

**Don't** ask for an apology. Require that she return your house key, require that she read and sign a roommate agreement before she can move back in, but focus on *what she does* not how she acts. 

She wants to bang an ex-con and hang out at his place? Not your business.
She wants to make faces at your boyfriend? Not a fight worth having. 
**Don't** get baited. Don't try to justify your position, don't argue, don't get defensive, and don't explain your reasons. Set boundaries, and if they're broken, respond with the stated consequences. "
"I would just plan a nice date somewhere in the vicinity of Valentine's Day (and let them know there's no pressure for it to be anything big), and maybe get them a small token present, like some chocolates or something small related to something they mentioned in conversation on your first few dates."
Do you want to be your mother dating your dad?
Probably free lance development. Since he has family money he wouldn't be feeling pressured to work more than a odd few hours 
"You should seriously consider stopping all financial support of them. You are being taken advantage of, plain and simple. They don't appreciate your financial help and are basically spitting in your face; you're good enough to take money from, but not good enough to inherit half of the house you are currently paying for.

Just wait until they ask you to contribute more because your brother needs money for his child (and doesn't feel like working for it)."
"Just keep ""loving"" on her. Have her be your special helper, give her a special toy or pencil (I gave my fav female students little nail polish sets, candy, smelly goods, girly little make up sets from the dollar tree, when they were having bad days). I miss having those sweet girls; they always helped me clean up and made me smile when I was rough days as an ""art on the cart"" teacher too. Many of my sweet wonderful girls were poor and they loved to help me and I couldn't help but spoil them with cheap goodies and lots of love. I always gave them hugs and sat with them at lunch time. I wish I could have adopted some of them. I hope they turned out alright. Bless their hearts. "

"You sound much more mature than your step brother. It's weird, almost sounds like he's gaslighting you. I'd stop trying to talk it out since he has selective hearing. Tell him when you want his opinion you'll ask for it. 

You should feel free to have guys over since the house owner (sister) said it was fine, you pay rent, AND he's a hypocrite since his gf lives there too &amp; he has friends stay over for days (wtf?).
