"I didn't say that he did something that was terrible, I meant that, as far as personalities go, they're not compatible. 

He should have said something long ago instead of letting things fester and she should have been more mindful, but overall I think there was no real communication."
"Learned this from my sister who's on her way to being a nurse - when sick or healing from something, eat BRAT foods: Bananas, Rice, Apples, and Toast. All gentle, easily digestible foods. "
"I highly doubt a 13 year old restraining order is still active.  Typically they need to be renewed, and unless OP is leaving out a recent violent encounter, doing so would be difficult and/or not worth the time."
I do worry about how it might change my relationship with his mother. She was very glad to see we were friends again and I would never like to lose her mentorship or friendship. 
"Yea, honestly I'd talk to a lawyer OP, and see if after you end it (if you do that) if you can get some money from him. "
"Omg. You're amazing. You're hilarious. You're thoughtful. You're patient. You're, deep down, self caring. 

Go get a man who will cherish all these things about you."
I don't see why a person in a relationship can't make a new friend.
"Seriously, OP.  You're not going to be able to ""nope"" out of that situation when they've got your passport and you have no way to contact anyone.  "
I feel like the term gas lighting gets thrown around really easily these days. It's really just psychological projection to distract her from the real manipulator.
"&gt;  What can I do?

Stop trying to be so understanding and get angry. Do you really want to spend your life with someone who ""goes nuclear"" over a decade old picture of you innocently hugging a friend? If she trusts you so little and responds so excessively to something so minor as this then you are going to have a bad time. Marriage is supposed to be forever, she clearly is not ready for that. I think you need to take this situation as an opportunity to help her overcome her trust issues, starting with just straight up pure anger at her for how she is treating you right now. You do not deserve this. She is fucking up your marriage before it's even begun, that is complete bullshit. I think you need to respond to her going nuclear by going nuclear yourself and giving her an ultimatum: The marriage is off until she attends couples counseling with you and makes a legitimate effort at overcoming her issues.

Really dude, you need to stand up for yourself and lay out the facts for her. She is behaving terribly, stop trying to legitimize it and start demanding that she do something about it. 

Alternatively, it could also be that she is projecting here. It is supposedly a very common behavior in relationships that the partner who has cheated will falsely accuse the other of cheating. How certain are you her Vegas bachelorette party didn't get out of hand? Could the reason she trusts you so little be that she herself is not trustworthy?"
r/legaladvice is going to be a *really* good help here.
"I don't mean that he had any insidious intent at all. I don't think they're in an abusive relationship or anything. I'm just saying that when a 28-year-old *wants* to date an 18-year-old, it's usually indicative of his maturity level/life stage. What I'm saying is that this relationship might be fine now, but in a few years she might realize he's still a man child.  "
"&gt; Had it been at 18 and dating a 34 year old, that would have been an almost grooming situation and it almost can be shown in some of your comments.

It was, actually. OP was 18, bf was 34 when they got together. They moved in together 2 years ago (26/42). "
"If you told your parents he is shitting blood, and they ignore that, this is CPS time. Blood in the stool is very very bad. Seriously, you sit them down and say BLOOD IN THE STOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This needs a Dr NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And if they do nothing, tell grandparents or uncles and aunts and see if they can talk some sense into your idiotic parents
"
"&gt; I trust him, but I don't trust her.

So you think she will rape him?"
"It's easy to be good with kids when you can give them back, though. 

J/w, how do you split chores at home now? Any pets?"
"because he was just standing there with the bat over his shoulder. He has being swinging it previously and stopped, I turned around and then he swung it in my direction and hit me. "
Sounds like she's not used to not getting what she wants. 
"So storming out of the room like a tantruming child and giving his wife the silent treatment for DAYS is totally ok because he's sexually frustrated? And she's LUCKY this cranky manchild hasn't cheated on her yet? You sound like a peach. 

What if they want kids? What happens when she gets pregnant and she is too achy to have sex, or doesn't want to? Or after she gives birth and CAN'T have sex for a month and a half? Or her sex drive tanks because she's nursing? Is it ok for her husband to throw fucking temper tantrums and cheat on her then?

Sure, this a compatibility issue that needs to be worked out. Sure, it might be a dealbreaker. But I'm assuming he knew about the sex drive disparity when he married her. Sexual frustration doesn't give him the right to treat his wife like crap and give her the silent treatment regularly.
"
"If she exaggerated the story, that still means he physically attacked her"
"&gt; Oh, and if you masturbate, make sure you permanently dispose of everything so she doesn't manage to find a way.

.... Is that... possible?"
"Hopefully no one noticed you. You following someone in or waiting on someone is soooooo inappropriate and could be seen in so many ways... Here's a couple of mine if I had witnessed this (not a lawyer)

This guy is possessive and checks on his lady all the time to make sure where she's at and will cause issues in the future (personal drama needs to stay out of the office). She doesn't have a car? Why is he driving her around? He's dressed like he doesn't give a fuck about where he's at. He probably doesn't give a shit about his SO interview at this important firm. This isn't a doctors office, wait for your GF in the car so we don't know you even exist. 

I mean, I work in an entirely different industry and I get weirded out when a man pulls up to drop his wife off to apply for a job and just waits in the car for her. How is she going to get to work? Is he controlling of her and her time? Is he going to be there everyday to do this? Does he not work? Is he going to somehow interfere with this persons ability to work?

It's not like you picked her up after a day in the office. She doesn't even have a job there. And even then you wait outside or in the downstairs lobby where no one will ever see or know you. Also, be mindful of what you wear. If you were going to meet her in the future to have drinks with colleagues you may want to rethink shorts and a ""fancy"" tshirt (I mean tshirts have a limit on how fancy they can be).

I don't get your logic on this one. You should have stayed in the car... I meant most people would have just stayed in the darn car. :/

"
"She's standing by her words she is still going to marry him, she is just disappointed.

Op I honestly think a sit down conversation will solve a lot. You made a unilateral decision about something that is important to her. Have you explained why you made that decision, the research you did, and explained why this was the best idea?

I know there's a lot of stigma around girlfriends being disappointed in rings. But it sounds like you two talked about and agreed to something beforehand and then you changed it without telling her.

It's like agreeing to buy a car, so she knows and is excited for the car she knows you are getting and then you roll up in a different car and it's like ""dafuq?"" 

Obviously she likes the ring. But there is definite confusion going on about why didn't you get what you agreed to, and will other decisions you come to together be changed last minute by you as well? 

Just communicate. It solves many problems. And it sounds like neither one of you is doing much of it right now."
I wouldn't even open one with someone I'm not married to! And even then it would probably be for joint bills or like a credit card lol. That's so crazy.
"My experience with academia is so completely different from yours.

I started a company in college with one of my professors - naturally we spent a lot of time together (I called him by his first name). Another professor was like a personal advisor to me, he was so welcoming - him AND his wife. they were very sweet people, and I was distraught when he passed away - I spent time with his wife &amp; son for a few days when I visited my college for the funeral.

I had another professor who would suggest cool beers for me to try (I had just gotten into beers in grad school).

I don't know what sort of institutions you folks go to, it's just bizarre to me that four different profs who have worked with and spent time with OP would just casually put her on blast.

Like, four people would have to actively decide to fuck over this woman ... why?

I'm not saying at all that OP did something wrong. Perhaps she's being framed: perhaps someone sent weird messages pretending to be her.

But there's something amiss here, I'm not yet sure we can just say ""oh this is academia"" "
But I *can't* be racist cause I'm *married* to one of them! Third world isn't technically a *race!* /s
"Your BF is being selfish, insensitive, and unrealistic.

1. He went and signed a lease without. This act alone lost him any right to make demands of your living arrangements. (Did he even consult you on this?
2. You made a contractual commitment that has economic ramifications. Unless he can afford to pay for breaking the contract, he has no right to make demand. (as per point 1, his actions lead to this.)
3. What kind of BF would demand that you show him love by screwing over your twin. If your BF is really setting up a ""me or him"" choose your twin every time.

---

&gt; but whatever, I love him

Watch this. You have a BF throwing a lot of red flags."
"You could wear two car air fresheners, one swinging from each ear"
I will see if they'll do that. Maybe I can at least go back to my original color
Could they be hoarders who are embarrassed of their house's appearance? Maybe that's why she seems lovely in person/online but doesn't want you in her home? Can you ask to meet them at a neutral place like out at a restaurant?
"Lol, when my niece came out it was exactly like that. But then we all really like potatoes. Good luck to you!"
"OP, I'm sorry for what you're going through. I understand your grief is very real, but I think you need to question whether the pregnancy actually was. I am currently pregnant with my first so it's very fresh what should have been going on with her pregnancy.

Every pregnancy is different, but at 7 months *most* women have certain signs:

1. OP, you should have felt the baby move. You should be able to *see* the baby move. 
2. Unless she was a big girl to begin with, her belly *should* have felt hard. I am by no means super skinny, but at 7 months my stomach felt rigid. 
3. At what point in the pregnancy did she show you the ultrasound? Did it have her name on it? For her to know the gender of the baby, she had to be *at least* twenty weeks along. My doctor waited a little bit after that, just to have a better idea. Also, if you have access to the ultrasound photos, they *will* have a ""gender"" picture on them. It should be circled. A little girl will have three lines (should look like a hamburger/hotdog bun) and a little boy will look like a turtle. Maria should have at least 10 pictures of the baby. The doctors go through and measure *every single* part of the baby's body. They give you these pictures. They also give you a CD of the baby moving around.
4. Most insurances only give one ultrasound unless there are complications. Doctors will *not* perform this ultrasound until 18-20 weeks (though quite frankly I do not believe they would do it before 20 weeks. None of the women I know got it before 20 weeks.)
5. Did Maria mention glucose testing? She should have been screened in her second trimester. They would make her drink something akin to Kool-Aid, wait an hour, and then draw blood. Did she ever mention this? It's a very important part of the process. Gestational diabetes can cause a lot of problems and pregnant women are tested in their second trimester. 
6. How often were her appointments? She should have went in initially at 8-10 weeks where the doctors would have confirmed a pregnancy. After that, she should have went in once a month until the second trimester. From there, she should have went in every two weeks. 
7. At 28 weeks (7 months) the baby would have been viable. This means that if Maria had felt something was wrong, the doctors could have possibly saved the baby. They would have told her to come in ASAP and would have gotten her an appointment that day, or told her to go to the ER. When I was 7 months, I had what amounted to prolonged Braxton Hicks. My OB had me come in at 2 AM in the morning *even though* she knew I'd (TMI warning) had sex and that it was most likely the semen causing the BH. OB's take pregnancy very seriously, even if you're a first time mom that calls in every single day with concerns. 
8. How long was Maria in the hospital after the stillbirth? She should have been kept in overnight at the very least. I don't mean to be graphic, but did you see Maria's vagina after the birth? I cannot stress it enough, but it should not have looked ""normal"". Maria should have been in what amounts to adult diapers due to the bleeding. It's possible she should have even had stitches. (In a full term pregnancy, the taint is either cut or rips and needs stitched up. In preterm, I don't know that the baby would have been big enough to tear the taint.)
9. Ashes are gray. For adults with fully formed bones, there are fragments. Regardless, the ashes feel smooth, almost like corn starch (with grit in it when they have bones). Also, there should not be a huge amount of ashes...for example, I have a dog that was 15 lbs that I had cremated. I have roughly a cup and a half of ashes. Your baby would have been 4-6 lbs at most. You should have (roughly) all together maybe 1/2 cup. 
10. There should be a paper trail. Maria would have had STD testing done at 10 weeks, both vaginally and a blood test. There should be at least 5 urine tests done (to screen for UTI's and preeclampsia). She should have had another blood test for glucose. She should have a wristband for her birth + still birth papers. "
"Well that's weird. He sounds like he went into the meeting not wanting to like them, given that he was pretty critical of minor issues.

You might have more insight after you meet his family, and see how he interacts with them. If not, I would make sure he knows that your parents are important, and he has to try meeting them again. "
"Just to reassure you, it's really easy to play with kids. You don't need to rough-house if it's not your personality. Really all kids want is someone to pay attention to them and boss around. Ask them to play and what they want you to do and follow along. It's like improv, always say 'yes'."
"Agreed!!!

The reason that I suggest going to HR, even if you do it in a way that's like ""Hey no big deal, but advice?"" is that this person is clearly behaving negatively to everybody, and by getting your voice on record, you're making it easier for anybody else to go to HR about her in the future.  My girlfriend has a terrible coworker who is almost to retirement, while she is brand new there, and when she went to HR, they were like ""Well we can't fire her, she's been working here for 30 years, but you are like the 4th person to report her and we know she's a problem.  Let's work with your supervisor to separate your job duties and maybe get you a private office, and in the meantime, if you find any openings in another department away from her that interest you, we'll make sure to recommend you to whoever's hiring.""

People are more likely to take your HR complaint seriously if multiple people complain about the same person, so either it's going to be easier because she's done this before, or you're going to make it easier for somebody in the future."
"Exactly this.  The solution is for at age 23 is to move out; she's unwilling.  There's not much you can do to better the situation as this is a family dynamic more than a relationship dynamic. 

As to the parents saying ""Enough with that nonsense, how could you do that to us?"" they are failing to realize that our job as parents is to prepare our kids for adulthood which includes accepting they are sexually active in an age appropriate manner and also by realizing that moving out isn't 'doing that' out of spite, it's the natural progression that supposed to occur in the 20's. "
"I think you're missing the point or being purposefully obtuse. This woman doesn't know you or anything about your relationship with your husband aside from what HE has told her. She could have thought you knew all about their friendship and were fine with it. 

If I were you, instead of being angry at her I would be outraged on her behalf. Your husband has been going through her social media and downloading pictures of her? Playing out some fantasy in his mind about her that she has no idea about? That's creepy. And a little scary in my opinion. 

It really bums me out when I see women blaming other women unnecessarily. I see it way too often on this subreddit and in life I guess. Instead of a accepting that your SO is being a scumbag I guess it's easier to place the blame elsewhere. "
Oh my gosh... I didn't even think of that.  I think she should have started that a long time ago.   His bedtime routine is usually just a diaper change.  (He bathes every morning )
I'm sure he could find one who offered that if he wanted. 
"As I said, I've lived in Asia 7 years, and had four under my belt by the time I lived in Thailand. I understand this about Asian culture broadly. I'm usually great at picking up cues. I didn't have a problem adjusting to the other cultures I was in. I'm talking about exchanges like this:

""OK, I bought a new shirt at a mall. Here it is, I'm wearing it, is it OK? Are the sleeves long enough? Is the collar high enough?""

""You worry too much! Of course it's fine!""

One week later I'm in the office because that shirt is inappropriate.

Maddening."
It could be that he eats something gas producing for breakfast and it takes that long to filter through his system. In which case if he is going to share cubicles he needs to change his diet.
"What's your incentive for seeing this guy? You don't seem to have anything positive to say about going on a date with him, you even call him a creep and worry about other folks thinking you're a gold digger.

If it's out of boredom, there's other things you can do and other people you can date.

If you're feeling pressure on the job front, ease his disappointment down gently, otherwise you're going to feel pressured to put out."
"Depending on where OP lives, infidelity may not be an issue.  Many states have eliminated fault divorce and only allow no-fault divorce.  OP, consult with a lawyer before you invest a lot of time, money, and energy in proving something that ultimately may not matter. "
And he will end up working 60hrs a week plus 10hrs a week cleaning. That leaves him with less leisure time tha  before. This is not a solution in any way shape or form
"This! The whole situation is bizarre to say the least, but the fact that he and his brother were talking about it months before he had even brought it up to you is a red flag. Have you ever noticed any strange behavior between him and his brother before this? I just find it so odd that they would casually have brought this up and agreed upon it. Honestly, it seems like a deal breaker, but if you still have hope that the relationship could continue, couple therapy might be a good place to start. "
"Don't be a grass.

I'd say, in the future, don't share things like this with your boss if they aren't going to be taken in the spirit which you hoped. It sucks that you wanted to express a way that would improve the software, but instead appears to be treated as a witch hunt. Learn from this, and don't put people at risk again.

In this scenario, if you feel secure enough - i'd recommend saying what you outlined at the end of your post. Emphasise that you do not want to risk the relationship you have with your co-workers, and you would feel uncomfortable in doing so. 

I'm sorry that people are terrible. "
"To be honest, it sounds like you're irresponsible about your birth control pill. Why do you miss it so much? I don't blame your boyfriend for being upset by thinking that you're covered and then realizing you're not. You say you told him ""next time you need to wear a condom,"" but why didn't you remind him either? If you don't encourage it, he might think it's not a big deal. You need to set the tone in regards to this. 

You both are wrong. You need to take responsibility for your birth control, and he could have compromised and gone with you to the pharmacy to get plan B. "
"Oh wow. When you made your first post, I thought your Aunt was probably just an ignorant worrywart. Turns out, she's a real jerk.

You did great. You researched the venue. You met with her maturely and calmly laid out your concerns. She just wouldn't listen. I'm so, so sorry for that.

I just... the mental gymnastic required to say that she doesn't want you to be jealous of people you age... like, she's aware that she has seen you in person before, and thus you have seen her walk? that you go to school? that your family routinely walks in your house? Such a ridiculous comment.

I don't know if it's her or your husband, but I think one of them doesn't want you in pictures. And if that's true, you don't want them in your life. 

Way to go on your exit. You really got the point across."
"Do not stay with a man who doesn't respect your culture. This is going to get worse if you get married and have children. 

I'm in a similar boat where a lot of my family don't speak English or only speak a small amount. My SO has always been lovely when he sees them. He's friendly, says hello, tries to say a few phrases in their language. He eats our cultural food, even though I know he isn't the biggest fan! He makes a huge effort because he respects me and my cultural background. In return, my relatives really like him and they're happy I am with someone who is embracing my culture even with the language barrier. 

Your partner made zero effort and has said some really, really disrespectful things about your parents. That is not okay. I feel terrible you felt you had to apologise because your parents have done nothing wrong. "
"So, $40 is $8 per hour, for the 5 hours. That sounds very fair. Tell your mom, nicely, not to do that again."

"Seriously, everyone is boring. I felt the same way when I started at my current job. Everyone at the firm lives in the city and does a lot of fun stuff on the weekends. I live in the suburbs, so it's a hike for me to come into the city and do some of the same activities. 

I just tell them that. It's difficult to get to the city. Also, I'm trying to save money. Be honest. At the end of the day, they probably don't care. It's just a formality to ask what people are doing this weekend/how was your weekend/etc. "
"Bluntly, he's going out with a 17 year old because he likes feeling like the one in the relationship who knows stuff. He can't get that with a girl his age. 

It's been 4 months. You don't align politically and he calls you names and shuts you down when you say things he doesn't agree with. Move on and find someone who is better aligned to you."
"Well, all we know about the situation is what OP tells us, and she's not particularly motivated to paint him in an unfairly favorable light. 

""Sometimes"" working 14 hour days is not the same as a regular 16 hour schedule. I don't understand this idea that people don't have to choose between an incredibly demanding career and a flourishing social life--there are only 24 hours in a day, and when you only have eight of them available to sleep, shower, and socialize, it's the socialization that's going to take a hit unless you're one of those rare people who can thrive on tiny amounts of sleep. 

In OP's situation, he scaled back his hours in preparation of starting a family and he was requesting that she do the same. That sounds fair. Shit usually has to change once kids get involved. The other ""fair"" situation , I guess, would be for them both to continue working 100 hour weeks and also somehow have time for children?"

"I both respect and disagree with your viewpoint at the same time. I respect that you changed your name for your own reasons and have history of having a different name.

However, I disagree with this: 

&gt;The question you need to ask yourself is if keeping your surname is worth the hurt, rejection, resentment, or whatever else he may feel. Is this a hill you're willing to die on?

If keeping her family name is important to her, why isn't her future husband considering her hurt, rejecting, resentment or whatever else she may feel? Her feelings and his both matter- but in the end, it is her name, and her choice. I agree that you should consider your partner's feelings, but that shouldn't negate her own. "

I URGE counseling, because if you continue in a relationship with these dynamics your son is going to learn that lying to your partner, treating your partner like crap, and cheating on your partner is acceptable. (Also it's not fair to you, but often people will put themselves below their children.)

If you do decide to walk there are many resources out there for women trying to leave their spouses. As you currently do the majority of the childrearing you're in a good position custody-wise. (Obviously talk to a laywer immediately if you want to leave to ensure you understand your options.) There are many people out there who will love you and treat you better. "

"The lunch meat thing struck a chord with me. Growing up with my family, when we made a sandwich with lunch meat, it generally consisted of 2 slices of bread, mayo on both slices, one slice of cheese, and 2-3 slices of lunch meat. I would eat ~12-16 oz of lunch meat in 5-6 sandwiches.

My husband, when we started dating, came to my apartment to eat lunch and proceeded to use nearly all of my lunch meat for the week in once sandwich. The same container that would yield 5-6 sandwiches for me made 2-3 sandwiches for him. Not because he was being greedy or inconsiderate, but because to him that was just  a ""normal"" sandwich and he didn't realize that I had budgeted my lunch meat differently than he would.

I think that is probably what's going on with your girlfriend...not that she thought ALL the lunch meat was for her, but that a ""normal"" sandwich has certain amount of meat on it, and that if three people were making sandwiches with that lunch meat you would have bought enough for all of them to have ""normal"" sandwiches.

On this issue, I think you should explain to her that your parents had intended for the lunch meat in the fridge to last for the whole week. Then I think you should go to the store with her, buy enough food for your parents to take for lunch, and have your girlfriend buy supplies for her own sandwiches so there is enough for her to have what she wants.

On the issue of cleaning the shower, I think this is a similar issue of ""this is normal"" on both of your parts. If you want her to spray something after each shower, I think you should just ask her. If you want her to do a deep cleaning with you on the weekend, I think you should just ask her. I wouldn't fault her for not offering, because people have different schedules for cleaning, different levels of picky-ness, and she might not realize her help would be welcome. If she has any common sense and courtesy, she will agree to help out, and if she is offended by you asking that points to a much bigger issue.

As for the length of her showers, I would suggest you tell her WHY it's a problem (other people need hot water and she's using it all, utility costs) and give her a concrete ""solution"" to improve things. Maybe she can take long showers at off hours. Maybe she can take ""Navy showers"" where she turns off the water when she's not actively using it (i.e.- get wet, turn it off, lather, turn it on to rinse, turn it off for conditioner and shaving, turn it on to rinse again). Maybe she can take a long shower at night if she takes a shorter one in the morning. Again, if she understands this has an ACTUAL negative effect on you/your family, she should be willing to comply, and if she's not, you have bigger issues.

Ultimately, I think you should approach this as ""we see things differently, how can we work better together"" instead of ""she is wrong, why is she doing this, what's wrong with her."" People grow up in different environments with different expectations and different sized sandwiches. You should be courteous to each other, and not assume your way is THE way, even if she is a guest in your home. Part of being a good host is being accommodating."
"Didn't know people in PA drove Teslas, thanks for the 411.

24k covers what? like a semester at Princeton?  Good luck on them keeping that crowd funding going for another 3.5 to 4.5 years depending on that student's course load!

Tacky as fuck asking people to pay for your kid's college education.  File a damn FAFSA and deal with the student debt like everyone else in America."
"This certainly sounds like something that couples counseling could help with. She sounds very insecure, both in her own skin and in your relationship. Her actions seem to be coming from a place of good intentions, but are seriously falling short of the mark. You seem to have a pretty good idea of how and why as well. These sweeping generalisations that she is receiving are downright bad and the fact that she takes every one of them at face value is worrying. 

Sit her down at a time that emotions are not high to discuss this and suggest attending therapy together to address the issues you guys have communicating. Hopefully she will be as willing to listen to a professional as she is to these other people giving her (frankly terrible) advice. Best of luck dude!"
"&gt; went on a long long rehearsed monologue.

I think you should ask your future in-laws why they think Lilly asked to come along to brunch."
You really don't want to know.
"The OP is Russian and lived in Russia for 13 years, I think it's safe to assume they are a native speaker.

"First off you need to take a deep breath. The baby knows something is wrong, she is probably really uncomfortable. You need to keep trying to contact family and I really think you should contact the authorities. It is completely inappropriate and  irresponsible of your brother to do this to you and the baby, it is also dangerous. if you have to, call or txt your brother and give him a warning that you are calling CPS or the police. Do you have any neighbors who can help you right now? Call your distant family, they may have advise and support for you, they may also be able to help contact your mother. I'm really sorry you were put in this situation. Try to calm down so it puts less stress on you and the baby, try picking her up and just walking around speaking calmly, it probably won't help becaus the baby is likely crying because she wants her parents. Your brother and his girlfriend really need to grow up and realize you can't abandon a baby with family, let alone an unsupervised teenager."
"Which is why his question is not ""should I dump her for good?"" but ""how can I tell her her timeline is unrealistic, or does anyone have resources to help me find a job there?"""
"But I saw a movie where nothing but fun and frivolity follows when you show up at a wedding you weren't invited to.  Hollywood wouldn't lie, would it?"
"You seem to be emphasizing in the comments quite a bit that it worries you when she's out alone, that guys might hit on her or be aggressive towards her.


But... you do realize she's a grown adult, right? And that this issue is something that's happened her whole life before you came into it, and is something that will likely continue for a very long time.


I can understand why you don't like it, completely. But framing it as ""I'm worried for her safety"" seems a little disingenuous to me. From what you've described, she's clearly capable of handling it. She's likely at no more risk of being hurt or taken advantage of than most other women, despite her appearance.


As for how to deal with it better - honestly, I don't have any good suggestions for you. Have you talked about how you feel with her, and if so, what is her response? 


I get that you don't want to change her, but if I can offer her a little advice from my own experience - it helps a great deal to cultivate resting bitch face, and it helps a great deal to utilize body language and facial expression to discourage people from initiating conversation. Aim less for ""neutral"" and more for ""I'm an active bitchcunt who thinks she's better than you."" It's unpleasant to have to give off that air publicly (I'm actually a pretty pleasant and kind person) but it will help cut down on the number of times she gets approached.  "
"I think OP might be in trouble anyway if his wife is making such a huge, life decision without him. A large tattoo is a big deal, face or no face, he has to look at it every day. OP you need to talk to your wife and find out why she did this without you.

Also, not meaning to hijack this but I'm 26 and have a large floral piece from armpit to hip, 10hr full colour dealio. Also a standard butterfly I got when I was 18. I understand tats are forever and people are not.

I really wanted my SOs name on me, but he said no way, so I've been thinking of some kind of symbol because I love him, but I dunno what I want. We're getting married soonish, I love tattoos, pretty sure something representing him is just an excuse for another tat, but as my current tats are meaningless I'd like one with meaning.

After reading this back, it sounds pretty immature, but as a professional, do you have any thoughts?"
"""Hey (person coming to your city), i would love to hang out with you, but i have to tell you something, things didn't work out between ex and i so we broke up, if you don't want to hang out with me anymore it's ok, but i just though you should know that"""
I'm very sorry. Your husband has betrayed you horribly. I hope you can either stay in the US if you like it there or quickly return to Spain to be among your friends or family.
"Technically, it's possible that she's pregnant.  But it's fairly likely that she either isn't pregnant or that you're not the father.  

For fertility purposes, you would have had to have had sex with her in a certain window (like 5 days or so) about two weeks before her period was due.  Although it's possible to test positive in the first few days you've missed your period, most women don't test themselves until they are a few days late.  So, if you had sex one month ago, and she's pregnant with your baby, she's only known she was pregnant for 1.5 weeks.  The drama you describe sounds like far more than 1.5 weeks.

Secondly, although some women can get hormonal early, most don't turn into raging maniacs in the first month.  

My bet is that you're dealing with someone who has mental problems.  If you haven't already, stop having sex with her.  Even if she is pregnant, you don't have to have any contact with her or give her any money.  The only contact you should have, at this point, would be to drive her to the clinic and pay (directly) for an abortion.

If she does have a baby, don't give her money or sign the birth certificate.  Get a Family Lawyer and have paternity and custody/support legally determined.

In the future, always wear a condom.  Some women lie about birth control.  Some women forget to take their pills.  And bc pills do have a small failure rate.  Always wear a condom."
"No thanks necessary.  

Even if you come off as being distant, hacking into your electronics and reading your emails/etc is not okay.  He's coming off as incredibly insecure and controlling.  Like I said, if after talking to him, he doesn't change quickly, I'd let him go.

I read in one of your other comments that he's been your only boyfriend.  You're only 21, and traveling the country and will be meeting many new people.  Even if it doesn't work out with him, you'll be okay.

The way I see it, a partner shouldn't stress you out (excessively, anyway).  He or she should be somebody you can go to to relax and enjoy time with.  If he's causing more stress than anything else, you need to take action before you emotionally- and physically- burn out."
They split time but they live with their dad more. Their dad probably won't do me any favors. He and my sister have an extremely volatile relationship and he and my mom don't get along either so he's lumped me into that as well. I may try down the road but he will probably say it's not his problem. 
"She dropped that she had a boyfriend as a hint to you, and she's probably acting like you asked to hang out as friends to help you save face. If you want to be her friend, meet up. If you don't, then don't.

Edit for clarifying question: did you specifically ask her out on a date or just to do something with you? My advice changes if it's the former. "
"Right? Some of the things ppl on this sub consider ""red flags"" are things my husband and i wouldnt bat an eye at. A marriage should have trust."
"Um, no.  She told him that she wanted to fuck other guys.

That is about the worst thing you can say to most men.  It's just like saying 'You're not enough'.

Worse, it sounds like they've never brought it up before.  That's an arrow right in the heart of most guys (and girls).

He certainly didn't handle the break up well, but I can sure see why he left so fast.
"
"OP, I'm sorry to be harsh, but this is just bullshit excuses.

You know what you *want* to do with them -- you want to say ""screw you, I'm not giving you anything because you screwed me over.""  You want to see her squirm, piss her off, make her beg for them.  This is a shitty little power play to get back at her for screwing you over, and I can totally get the appeal -- but it's not the right thing to do.

If it truly was about the time -- if honestly you'd prefer to just get rid of them and send them back but you can't find them and don't know where they are and you absolutely can't take a few hours to go through storage and find them because you're *so busy* getting everything ready for a move, then why didn't you mention that in the original post? 

Your initial post was looking for validation that it's OK to be pissy and screw her over.  You didn't get the reaction you wanted -- we're all telling you to send them back and put it behind you because these may actually have some sentimental value and you don't need to be an ass-hat -- so now you *totally would* but you just don't have the *time* because you're *so busy* from all the extra work.  

Spare the excuses, suck it up, find a few hours after work or on a weekend and dig through your shit until you find them.  Stuff them in an envelope, send them back to her, and the promptly block and lose her number so you don't have to deal with her again."
"...but presumably you don't love who they are as people, their smile, their sense of humour, their personality traits, the nice things they do. Otherwise you would still love them even if they turned out not to be your legacy or whatever. And presumably you don't even love the legacy-of-yours that didn't come from your DNA - the things you've taught them and the way they see the world - either."
I would stop having any sexual contact with her.  Baby fever can make people do stupid/devious things and OP will be stuck with a pregnant woman he will resent.
"Personal experience says don't do it, mate.
I did and it was shite.

Trying again with love is like watching the Harry Potter films after reading the books, no matter how much they change the middle you know how that motherfucker ends."
Only the stuff you don't want to hear?
"I suspect OP avoids banks due to the nature of whatever business she is in. ""Lucrative cash business"" and keeping her cash in a safe probably means she isn't operating entirely above board, whatever her business happens to be."
"Its different for everyone obviously, but don't you feel the same?  You spend more time with a partner, need to share your life with them, so obviously you need more."
"Your family deliberately created a menu of food that could KILL her.

She did the right thing, if my family had done that to my significant other, I would have immediately left the reception with my SO and had a huge fight with them after the wedding.  The fact that you are acting so obtuse even a month later is pathetic.  

Hopefully your ex finds someone who actually cares about her, and hopefully you grow up one day and stand up to your horribly toxic family."
"I think the mature thing to do would be honest with his mom and step dad about his concerns rather than just telling them what they want to hear. It doesn't have to be a yes/no answer, and really should be an open conversation."
"I think you will need to be able to better articulate the problem before you're able to have a productive conversation with your partner. She's going to wonder why you won't accept, when to her the money is meaningless. If all you have is a nebulous sense of discomfort, she may think you think badly of her, because your position isn't logical. I'm not saying you're wrong, but you need to be able to tell her exactly why you feel how you do. 

Here's the point where I segue into trying to convince you that you should go with her. Imagine for a minute that your SO was poor, but you both decided to go out to eat. But your SO insisted on McDonalds, because it was all she could afford. You however think McDs is kind of gross and you'd like to go to a proper restaurant. I mean, you love going out to eat with her but honestly you'd rather stay home if its McDs or nothing. Wouldn't it annoy you if she insisted on McDs, when the extra cost of a restaurant would be nothing to you and you'd be happier? Traveling to Europe on a budget might be like McDonalds to her. It doesn't make her a princess, but she might not be interested in roughing it. It may be a matter of pride, but you're basically asking her to be less comfortable on your trip in order to serve your ego. If you insist on your way, she'll probably be annoyed every time she shifts uncomfortably in her coach seat or looks around her hotel room. You've either got to go and let her pay, or agree to go somewhere else that you can travel in style but still afford. "
"How dare you accuse him of going through all the good points brought up in the last thread created by OP, that she sent to him before they met, and craft a masterful rebuttal to all her possible questions, in an attempt to make her doubt herself.

I mean come one, we gotta wait for more substantial proof. Maybe when OP finds pictures of herself on that revenge porn site ?

Even then, who knows, could have been uploaded by anybody, really."
IANAL but wouldn't moving states mean he abandoned the kid and she would be able to push for full custody?

"If you decide to go through with this, you should first do a *ton* of research to see what other obligations and responsibilities you will have, not just now, but also in the future.  $35,000 might seem like a lot but who knows what other things your new in-laws would ask of you as part of what's expected in their culture?  You need to somehow figure that out before you proceed, if you decide to do so."
But that's not a chore that requires more work from you
"I'm never gonna dance again. Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool. "
"I think I see what might be part of the problem: you say that she asks you to put things away and then you do.

You're an adult and your girlfriend should never have to ask you to put your clothes away or your dishes in the dishwasher. I'm not even super-clean and I hated that I had to always ASK my ex before he would do any chores. 

Your GF has been waiting for 5 months for you to clean up after yourself *without being asked*. Meanwhile, you've been waiting until she asks you, before you clean things up. She shouldn't have to ask you to do this very basic adult thing. "
"My boyfriend of 6 months has fallen asleep on top me on a few occasions, even while inside of me...we both work long hours and he's often just exhausted. It's never bothered me except that I can't move at all..."

"She's not dating a girl, so it didn't immediately come to mind.

"Regarding the rent, your MIL didn't want to give rent money to help Zach, she wanted it to be a means of exerting control over him. The arrangement you came up with using the loan lessened her ability to control you two in the future, which was why she was so upset."
"And to everyone saying Rick could just quit if he doesn't care about work - even ignoring the income difference where he made way more - why is it unreasonable to want your kid to have two parents in their life? I'm not bashing single parents or kids with one parent (I'm one of those!) But *surely* most people's ideal situation is for both parents to be in the picture.

He wasn't saying the kids couldn't be cared for, he was saying he wanted them to have a mother.

(Not to mention I don't even think he was asking her to become a SAHM, just saying she could if she'd prefer or even just that her losing money from cutting hours would be fine since they could get by no matter what)"
I think you're getting down votes because a lot of people have had experiences where the guy isn't a reasonable person so they feel like her expectations aren't too low for someone who isn't their official partner. 
"Yeah, honestly in her husbands place I'd need to hear a very strong denial not to believe that."
"As a man as well, I definitely remember being 14 and something of this nature would have been impossible for me to speak about to anyone, no doubt.  I never did outgrow that inability to share my feelings and I can tell you it has cost me in my life.   By all appearances I'm healthy and well adjusted.   Truth is, it's hard to be isolated in my own head.  I just don't share myself with anyone and it's been a mistake. 

Please go see this counselor, learn to share your feelings.  It's ok to be vulnerable and this person will help you.   Learn to trust, you need this life skill.  Q"
"Well it's mostly because women are usually the primary caregivers, period."
"For what it's worth, I'm really happy to see you taking these comments to heart. It takes some guts to admit something like that and it's brave of you to make the changes you need to be happy.

"Your replies of denial and it won't ""end as easily"" as you want are annoying"
"I don't believe this is it - I am definitely her closest friend. She calls me for all the good, all the bad. We are long distance friends, and we talk extensively more than once a week, mostly on her calls. It'd be very easy for her to slow-fade because of the distance, but we make an effort to stay in touch and she's visited me a plane ride away many times."
"My ex started dating a 17 year old when he was 26. When I found out I wasn't surprised because he's that immature and it's easier for him to embellish and impress a younger person because they haven't had as much life experience. When we were together and would go to family parties, he'd typically gravitate to the youngest people and feed them full of shit and they would eat it up, but that stuff didn't work with older people. Maturity levels and power issues are typically the main reasons that anyone would date someone that much younger, that's what I always think of when I see such a big age gap."
"I had to look it up because I thought she was making a Skyrim insult sound intense, but a quick google search shows that it's actually used.

Also, you were the one who called HIM after the birth, right? He couldn't be bothered to call his wife who just gave birth to check on her. Normal hospital stuff? Give me a break. He isn't married to the freaking hospital and giving birth is special TO YOU and it should be to him. 
I can't possibly see a solution to this. He is a jerk. An asshole. Dead beat husband. Call him what you will. I'm really sorry and angry that you are going through this, OP.

"Yeah, the girl sounds ungrateful to be sure, but the phrasing ""I saved her $300"" isn't really accurate unless she came to OP and said that she wanted professional makeup but all the options she sees are too expensive &amp; asked for the favor in a more specific way.

"As much as I empathize with you on wanting less interaction with strangers, I figure being above-average open and friendly to people in public is pretty important to being a local elected politician.

"&gt;  I think she's being a tad unreasonable here.

&gt; I don't think you are the problem here.

I disagree with the above comments. There's a lot of people who are just REALLY cranky in the early hours of the morning and don't like to be woken, and that's a fair way to be. She's allowed to feel that way. Of course, you gotta wake up when you gotta wake up! Still, it's a two-sided issue is all I'm saying.

Anyways, as the top comments say, sleeping separately is probably the best course of action here. "
What is with the posts today? You killed her battery with your carelessness and then expected her to take care of it. Have some damn personal accountability for your actions.
It's probably for the best to not talk to her anymore. You'll only give yourself more pain. The relationship would have ended anyways (because no one here buys the platonic biting story) so better to get away before the hurt gets bigger.

"Though it could give ""go fuck yourself"" a new meaning."
This makes some sense but I still feel extremely violated. 
"While I agree it isn't, nevertheless OP and his friends have shown his girlfriend that they don't respect her right to her own body and that she daren't fall asleep around them without risking them assaulting her in a way which has long term consequences. These jerks are not safe to be around, and i expect that's the message that'll get around."
That's easier to say when we're not in the heat of the moment. A drunk dude was screaming at OP and had _already_ been screaming at OP before she left. Highly likely that this is a normal thing for this family. Dad was grabbing OP and refusing to let go even though he was hurting her. I don't see any issue with BF defending them with a punch to the face.
Now now. It's very possible that her dad is younger than this guy!
"Jesus twerking CHRIST.

That's a dumpable offense! Don't be with someone who can be so cruel."
"Honestly, the man who passed probably thought of you as a good, hardworking friend who deserved everything he gave to you in his will. The rumors will be hard to stop, seeing as it is mostly his family trying to excuse his unexpected behavior in the will. Personally, I would not give them the car or money. I find it would be disrespectful to bit abide by the deceased final written words of sort (generally my opinion on it). You said the man was a millionaire, so his family is just being bratty (it seems, to me at least) because they didn't get exactly what they wanted. I would just suggest keeping in the loop until you are able to get what he gave you in the will, and then keeping the family our of your life (i.e. no contact)"
"I'm fine with her attending, I'm not fine with her being involved. I don't even trust her to do something that's inconsequential.


A few things to clarify:


I live 100 miles away, I would never and can't just ""take them."" Their dad has primary custody, she has them 2 nights a week or so. I'm well aware of all the custody things. 


My mom desperately needs to kick her out. I don't think she's actually on anything at the moment but you never know. The girls stay with her 1-2 nights a week. The reality is that the girls have a roof over their heads at their dad's and if my sister cannot provide a place to have them for their overnights, they will be fine and just stay with their dad. It's a long, complicated, relationship and story as far as her parenting. My sister has lived with my mom off and on for 5 years or so, my mom had primary and legal custody of the kids for almost 2 years, it's...a mess. My mom has sacrificed so much and deserves to have her life back. "
"This is really well said and probably dead on. It makes me feel a little tender toward OP's dad, because, dammit, even if it's ham-fisted and clumsy, the guy is trying. 

Though I'm not sure there's really a solid case to be made for straightening (ha) him out. It might just plunge it all back into irretrievable awkwardness. I'd just say, eh, let it ride. Let dad learn at his own pace."
"I had to check your ages, you sound 17.  
Stop having unprotected sex, seriously. "
"I am also taking the bar next week. I get wanting to protect your S/O from this. I also get why he would be mad that you kept this from him. But honestly I think you are doing the right thing. There is nothing he can do until you get the results. It could be nothing. Why freak him out before you know what is really going on. I wouldn't normally recommend keeping secrets but I know how tough mentally preparing for the bar is. 1 small thing could just set him off and keep him from being able to focus. 


I would recommend congratulating him when he is done and then telling him the full truth. Apologize for keeping it from him but explain why you did it. I really hope everything works out for you though. And more importantly please remember to take care of yourself. Cancer is a scary thing and you need to make sure you are mentally ok. "
This comment doesn't make any sense.  Why would it be expensive for you to get them from wherever you put them?  You make it sound like paying off debt is such an impossibly full time activity that you can't manage to deal with the cuff links at all.  But you had time to write this post.
"I'm not really a fan of 'testing' in relationships, but you might want to consider it. 

Try saying ""no"" to something he wants to do and asks you to do with him (concert, show, movie, dinner, whatever), and see how he reacts. It's not really a 'conflict' but if he acts badly about it then you should have all the information you need about the relationship. "
"""But she asked me to draw her. She even posed for me.""



Ugh. I just see this getting twisted around on OP no matter how she handles it. 





OP, is there a teacher, a friend's parent, a distant relative that can help you out here?  "
"And you didn't call the cops because...?

Seriously, it's cop time. You're definitely in danger of physical harm, I wouldn't take any chances personally."
"Because if she's a subtle bitch and slowly drives OP away, she gets to be the one who says ""oh woe is me, I was such a good friend to OP for so many years and she's ABANDONED me. I bet it's because OP think's she's so much BETTER than me because she's a DOCTOR."" 

She's now more clearly in the wrong and doesn't want to have to feel any guilt"
This I agree with. My ex and I discuss all purchases to do with kids that are more than just an occasional  $20 toy. 
"Due to her lack of experience, does she think the average penis size is 9 inches or something? Did she not see the penis size of other nude-beach-goers, which I am assuming is a good cross-section of the population?

Since she is your wife's friend, your wife needs to shut that shit down. She needs to put a firm boundary that your penis size and sex life is not up for discussion (Jesus H Christ, does she have no social tact???). She could explain anatomy if she must: growers vs. showers, that the average penis size is like 5.5 inches in America, and girth is generally more important than length at any rate. Her friend is being super dense and NOT HELPFUL. Seriously. She's just embarrassing herself at this point."
Yeah just go with that.
"&gt; stop making excuses for his extremely childish behavior.

She seems more ashamed that someone posted this video online where people can easily view it as opposed to being disgusted by the way he treats other human beings and his views toward women. I'm appalled, honestly. "
"I want to add that while you are super insulted by her accusation, which is understandable... You are doing your situation no favors by not refuting the claim. Your wife has a much deeper issue here and she needs to address it or else things will get much worse before they get better. Your daughter will say much worse things over the course of her life. Your wife needs to be able to handle emotional outbursts from her. She's just a kid. "
Shouldn't she be out of the wedding anyway? She must have gained at least five pounds of pregnancy weight. Wouldn't want to ruin the Big Day.
"OP, this guy has violated every boundary that you have tried to put in place.  I'm sorry to say that my advice is to go ahead and do now what you in your heart know you need to do :  tell this guy that the relationship is not working for you and that you are ending it.  Go no contact.  I can totally understand that you are concerned for your safety because he has *issues.*  But dragging it out is just going to make him crazier.  Go no contact and block him on all media.  If he keeps harassing you , file for a temporary protective order for stalking.  "
"&gt; YOU'RE NOT THE ONE THE THING IS HAPPENING TO.

This is fucking brilliant.

Anyhoo, to OP, why can't you just go by Mrs. HisLastname, and on your taxes and driver's license you can be whomever the fuck you want. 

I'm in a professional field where changing your last name can be frowned upon, and lots of women have one name that they go by professionally, and a different legal name. It's not a big deal. I also have several friends who did this out of sheer laziness, it's a lot of paperwork. And, since the girl is the one who it's happening to, I think this is a fair compromise."
"Seriously this. And make him go with them on the shopping trip so he's there to buy back the toys as well. Also, if he gets an allowance, suspend it to cover the cost as well. "
"If she isn't interested in showering or bathing every day, she can still spot clean her genitals with wet wipes or a soapy wash cloth. It's normal for that area to smell after a day or so without washing, but understandably, you don't want to put your face right there. It's okay to tell her to please wash up before oral sex.

I'm not a sweaty person at all due to a condition, but even I wouldn't invite someone downtown without washing it beforehand. That just seems courteous."
"The whole time I'm reading this, one word kept coming back to me: control.  He wants to control you. He wants to control your sexuality.  He wants to control your masturbation.  I don't know how else to say this, but this isn't good or healthy.  He also admits he doesn't trust you to be faithful.  None of this adds up to a healthy relationship.  Unless he gets some therapy, I can't see this working out, sorry."
"Do not be a messenger.

If friends want him to apologise they can ask or tell him, not you.

I am crying... because OP makes me sad with her spineless and soulless life choices

Tell your husband no. Just no. And tell him that it is not okay to discuss (and specifically make plans regarding) your sex life with anyone outside of this marriage."
"My graduate advisor went on a shouting tirade on me for twenty minutes straight and made me cry because I asked him for more guidance. He told me I was the worst student and that I made his life difficult. Seriously it was like someone flipped a switch, he went from pleasant to berserk in an instant. There's no psychological screening for  professors :( but maybe there should be..."
"That's brutal--congratulations on developing a strong sense of logic and skepticism despite the environment you're in. Since they aren't abusing you or doing anything illegal, I think all you can really do is spend as much time out of the house as you can, pursuing things that will help you get into college and get a good job. 

Honestly, you aren't going to change their minds. There's two of them and one of you, and I believe that research suggests that when you show people information that runs counter to their conspiracy theories, they actually dig in more. 

Have they always been this way, or is it relatively new?"
"Your husband has a pattern of cheating, lying, and hiding.  This isn't a one time mistake, this is intentional cheating with remorse only when he is caught.  You have seen/heard enough evidence that this is still ongoing.  Honestly his one chance at forgiveness came and went over the first incident.  Safe to assume now that he will not be faithful. Your trust in him is broken, so if you choose to stay, it will be a very tough road.  Even then, it sounds like you have only dated him? You can do better, you deserve someone who is faithful and honest with you."
"You dated for two years before you got married and you didn't see any of this behavior before?

I'm leaning with the others in the ""young trophy wife"" thing. You need to look good, give him children and keep your nose out of his affairs, and in return, he keeps you well maintained, and a $5,000 allowance every month to boot.

You're getting a glimpse of the rest of your life."
"That's not normal Borderline behaviour, unfortunately sounds like severe psychosis :( he needs psych help, and fast. I would have called the police/ambos on the night tbh if he was threatening to jump off the balcony and then he would have been involuntarily committed at least temporarily. Well that's what happens in Aus at least (I've been through it more than once lol). 

Please don't leave your friend with him alone at all and if he is the least bit threatening call the police right away. I know she doesn't want them involved but try remind her it's to keep him safe too, and everyone around him. Good luck. x"
"Okay, if that isn't your thought process, explain what it *is*. Why would you want your child to be around a horrible person like this? What good do you think will somehow come of that?"
"There could have been a Snorlax. 

If I saw a Snorlax, my **ex**boyfriend is not at the top of the list of people I would text to inform. In fact, he's not on the list at all. "
"I don't like having it either because I don't even like to consider that my partner would need such a talk to not fuck other people besides me. Stories likes yours make me think I'm way too idealistic. 

I feel really bad for you. I think you should have another talk with him. Ask him who he fucked (were their specific people or was it a bunch of one-night stands), how he fucked them (safe or not safe I mean), when he did that (did he specifically go out of his way to pick times when he wouldn't need to mention it to you), etc. Get as much details as you can and then make a decision. This will not be easy on you."
"&gt;actually divulging my thoughts to him feels impossible.

#WHY?  

You just divulged your thoughts to a bunch of total strangers!  Do you suppose that we're all wrong, and that you're right to go through your life being super-hard on yourself?"
"If she won't cut contact with him completely and give you full access to you electronic devices, then I don't hold much hope for salvaging this. If I was you, I'd tell his wife right away."
"I find that the most racist people are the ones who will fight tooth and nail to claim that they aren't racist.

I have some racist inclinations and thoughts sometimes. I do my best to be aware of this and not allow it to translate to racist behavior. I feel like it's important to be aware of your own shortcomings and improve upon them. The people who refuse to acknowledge their own racism won't ever get better at being less racist."
"You refer to ""when the kids are there"". Do they usually live with their father? Is he someone you can talk to about it?"
"In the legal profession, cutting your hours before making partner is career suicide."
"I feel like you are nagging &amp; behaving in a way that is counterproductive to getting what you want. Not sure why you expect this proposal or a marriage to last if you are full of resentment about him &amp; the relationship. If you can't even look forward to a vacation with him &amp; don't go, reckon relationship is done. If you go on the trip &amp; still keep up this attitude you have, it's done. 

I think you need to find a way to enjoy &amp; appreciate life with your boyfriend on a day to day level &amp; quit this compulsion to care so much about your timeline - enjoy the journey, or end the relationship. Your timeline is no more important than his &amp; he is being more patient with you than you likely deserve. Pull your head in ASAP if you want to keep this guy!"
"My dad is very much alive and this has me sobbing. OP, my mom once told me when I went through the ""what happens when you die??"" stage that because she loved me so much, that love would always be alive even when she wasn't. Please remember that. Your dad's love lives on in you. Him singing that song was a labor of love and only showed a fraction of what he felt for you. &lt;3 "
"Garlic bread is love, garlic bread is life."
"I get that. But do people on this sub think every disagreement is abuse?

He is not forcing me to do anything. He has not stopped me from going to work. He has not cut off my communication. He has not blocked me from our finances (nor would he be able to.) He has not raised his voice at me, he has not been passive aggressive, he has not tried to stop me from leaving the house. Our day to day live had continued as normal despite this ongoing disagreement. 

I came here for advice because while I think my husband is 100% wrong about this, I also recognize that he is typically a calm, rational, smart man and I respect his opinions. So I thought maybe there was some angle to this situation that I was not seeing. I don't see this argument as immediate grounds for divorce or the potential for abuse. If it gets worse, I might see your point. But my husband has literally never shown an abusive or manipulative tendency, and this is the first time we have ever had a disagreement of this magnitude. I truly do not believe that this is a red flag for domestic abuse. "
That's definitely our next step. 
"&gt; He has told me that he values the long timeline that his name is associated with, and that it helped shape his upbringing.

That's great, but his upbringing was not your upbringing.  Marriage may join you as a unit, but it doesn't mean that the two of you cease to exist as individuals.  You should be able to honor him and his family and his culture without what (for you) amounts to a declaration that his heritage matters more than everything you've been through to make the name you grew up with your own, and it's troubling that he sees any attempt at a compromise that respects your values as insufficient.

If you two really can't get past this, then it's not too late to cancel or postpone the wedding while you try to get past this impasse in counseling.  And frankly, you probably should at least do the latter, since it's doubtful this is the only area in which his traditional values run deeper than you realize.  You don't want to hit a more serious stumbling block after you've said ""I do."""
"Sounds like when he feels jealous or insecure he goes after you to make himself feel better. Ugh. 

Considering he hasn't stopped or tried to change his behavior when called on it, you might be better off walking away from this. The first six months of a relationship is supposed to be the honeymoon phase - do you really want to see what he'll be like when he's no longer on his ""best behavior""? 

If you want to try to work through it, I think your best bet would be to think very carefully and make a list of all incidents that follow this pattern. Sit him down, go over the list, and tell him these sorts of belittling comments are unacceptable. If he's willing to listen and change, maybe things could work out. If he blows up and/or tells you you're being oversensitive, not so much."

"I really hope you see this. Speaking from both personal experience and lots of research and reading: it is completely, totally possible for a person with a serious mental illness or personality disorder like BPD to have a healthy, happy relationship. But it is not possible, at all, for them to have that healthy, happy relationship with the same person with whom they have had an unhealthy, destructive relationship. You have broken up five times in four years - that is not a healthy relationship. It is not a healthy way of dealing with conflict. You *need* to end this relationship, not just for your own sake, but for hers. She needs to get control of her life and get to a position where she can start a relationship that is healthy *from the beginning.* So long as you stay with her, she will not be able to accomplish this. And you need to take what you've learned in this relationship and use it to establish a stronger, healthier relationship. It needs to be a relationship that starts out strong, from the beginning. I am confident that you've learned a lot about yourself from this relationship - but so long as you are carrying around the baggage of four turbulent, mental-illness inflected years, you will not be able to act on that knowledge. You both have a lot of growing to do. Do yourself and do her a huge, huge favor, and take the next step in that personal growth. End this relationship so that you can both focus on what you each need to be happy. So you can both find a stable, loving, happy relationship that will provide the support you both need to reach your full potential. This Paris thing is a distraction. You need to stop using being the practical, stable, responsible one as an excuse to not take a hard look at your own life and what you need to do to take care of yourself and set yourself up for success."
"&gt; This kind of behaviour makes me believe that the dog will just grow to fear Mike rather than love him

You are likely correct. The dog doesn't understand being shoved and chased means Mike wants him to go in a certain room. It's just going to scare him. It's a ridiculous way to treat this poor animal.

&gt; I think it just makes the dog feel like the bedroom is the bad place where he's locked in all night with the scariest of the three humans in the house.

Bingo.

He is treating this dog horribly- even if that isn't his intent. Rescues from abusive environments NEED to be treated a certain way. The running, the cowering and the growling all point towards the dog seeing him as his abuser- not his loving owner. The dog isn't being a ""weirdo."" The dog is associating these behaviors with its previous pain. 

Do some research and present it to him. Sit him down, and show him research on why the dog is behaving this way, and offer to work with him for the dog's sake. "
"She may be his step-sister, but that's still kind of creepy. 

You're right, the three-year difference might not be that big a deal, depending on how emotionally mature the girl is. 

But 50 drawings of the same person? You don't agree that's obsessive?

It might take all afternoon to do just one; he's spending *way* too much time fantasizing about someone who is out of bounds and lives in the same house. She's not going to feel safe anywhere around him after this."
"At 19 I could not imagine engaging with a 12 year old in a way that would lead me to mooning them, no. That seems absurd and highly inappropriate, even ignoring this was an aspiring teacher? Please, no."
He probably cheats where it involves money exchanges.
"I get what your saying, but I think once pandora a box is opened it can't be closed again. If I was told "" hey I would like to fuck or be in a relationship with others while we are together"" and I feel no, that's the last thing I'm interested in, how are you going to be ok knowing your SO desires others enough to bring up nonmono and change the dynamics of your relationship? We know they broke up that night, but not what there conversation was between friend and fiancé "
"Why did the groomsman invite her without checking with your fiancé and the others? That's the weird part of this story to me. If she has hung out with this group of guys before, even if it's been a while, that doesn't seem weird to me. I've been to a bachelor for my best guy friend where I was the only woman and it wasn't a big deal. We went to paintball, dinner and then drank while playing poker. I'm going to another one in the fall where my husband and I are both in the groom's part of the wedding party. She might be trying to attend this event instead of the others specifically because it's a rare event and one that is probably important to your fiancé. 

Also, if your fiancé doesn't really care, I would probably say it's not worth worrying about. If the other groomsman has an issue, I would tell him to bring it up and stay out of it. Let the guys figure it out amongst themselves. "
"I wouldn't even say the first part, just stick with 'do not contact me'."
"This morning when I came downstairs I discovered my husband had stayed up late last night and emptied the dishwasher and washed the pan I had soaking in the sink. The counters were wiped down too.

He's definitely getting lucky tonight."
"Ok. I was going to approach this and say ''yeah, it does seem pretty strange''. But when I read this 

&gt;He says he just wasn't sure if 'it was something our relationship needed'. (????)

I now want to go out on a limb and suggest that maybe, what if, twerking is something he associates with disposable women, or rather, women who aren't exactly dating material, if you catch my vibe...? 

And if this is the case, what if he doesn't want you to twerk because it would be reducing you in his eyes, to one of these women who twerks, but whom he associates with being trashy or something? I'm not saying women who twerk are trash, calm down ladies. I'm saying you* can be attracted to really dirty trashy women in porn (I know some aren't like this at all) but not want your partner to emulate said look. So what if this is sort of what he's doing? 

In other words: He could be turned on by something really quite devaluing for women, and thus he wouldn't want you to emulate said something, because then you as his lover, friend and intellectual equal might become less appealing. Does that make sense? 

edit: I typed ''you'' twice. "
"I bet he is still with the other woman. And I bet that he wants to set things up to decrease his child support. Like, if you and the kids visit every weekend, he doesn't have to pay as much. What a slime ball. Please continue to rock your new life, your new job, you new home, and your new honey."
"This is a manipulation tactic on his part.  Ignore, and continue on.  "
"If he's made a big mess in a shared space all by himself, he should clean it up. That's pretty standard, I think? "
"Clearly she doesn't feel the same way. It's her body. If you dislike that she doesn't have any inhibitions about nudity and she obviously does not want to change that, then you need to either get over it or break up. "
"It concerns me that you talk about how bad your memory is and that you don't know if they're making up things to justify yelling at you. To me that speaks to some pretty bad anxiety if there's no apparent medical cause for it. Is that the main context you have memory problems in, or is it more consistent? If it's consistent it might be something else, but if it's only around your family then it could be your brain trying to protect you from the way they treat you. Have you spoken to a school counselor about what public mental health resources are available? I know they're not well-funded at the moment (I'm in NZ, it's very similar here) but if you tell them the effects this is having on you they might be able to help find something while you're on that waiting list. In the meantime you could start figuring out what you would have to do to move out. Research what financial aid there might be. Look at the employment market. I'm pretty sure that's tough in Sydney as well but you might be able to get an idea what's realistic. Could you even move cities after school to go to university somewhere else? Living costs might be more manageable somewhere else. 

Until you find a way out though, the best option might be to try to pull back both emotionally and physically. Try to spend more time out of the house. If you can get a part time job that would be a fantastic reason, otherwise the library would be quiet and settled. When you are home, try to keep your head down and do whatever you have to do to look after yourself. It's hard to change how you react and how they affect you, but sometimes it helps a little to imagine there's a glass wall in between you, protecting you from the worst of the anger. And if you make a plan and start working on the things you can do to prepare - saving money, researching, looking up advice for living on your own for the first time and learning that, even just going through it in your mind - it will give you something else to focus on."
House cleaner. Hire a reputable company. Sounds like you can afford it so why spend your energy on this?
"OK, he's allowed a preference, you are allowed to ignore it. Dont either of you expect that to automatically result in a happy agreement.

*But, not wanting to be too judgemental here, the baby spice look is ridiculous for a 23 year old and was even on her.* "
"&gt;trying to impress women with respect and dignity 

People should just have those by default, it's not something to ""impress"" with.  Saying ""I treat women with repect and dignity"" is like me saying ""I like to make a point of never stabbing puppies,"" and expecting to impress people with that. It should be a GIVEN. Nobody is impressed by it. 

You impress people with charm and wit, by being interesting and exciting, by making pulses flutter, by being exceptional. And you might BE exceptional, but if you're not talking about it, then you're not impressing. You need to talk about yourself. 
 
&gt;Maybe that's what's making me come across as genuine

The thing is, you don't come across as genuine to me. You come across as highly restrained and robotic. Like every word is carefully chosen and slipped into place, so as to put up a careful façade. For example, your ""rules"" about only giving a peck on the cheek - nobody WANTS that. What people WANT is to make out with passion and gusto. You are depriving yourself in order to come across a certain way, to ""appear"" respectful. That is the opposite of genuine. If you just WANT pecks on the cheek, then that's a problem too, you lack the kind of passion and chemistry that a new relationship requires. 

&gt;I don't trust letting myself be overly passionate or engaged

You were a college kid. College kids aren't trustworthy. You are a grown man now. You STILL don't trust yourself? What does this mean? If you break your ridiculous rules about respect and pecks on the cheek you'll go haywire and rape women or something? Come on - give yourself some credit. And if you can't give yourself some credit, women will see that, and THEY won't trust you, either.  I think this is what really comes across in your posts, now that I think about it. You have so carefully crafted this false persona, and it's so transparent. You are terrified, and lonely, and probably DO have some great stories to tell. But rather than show that real side of yourself, and allow yourself to be human, you have crafted this plain vanilla robot persona. ""Follow the rules. Be respectful. Do not talk about myself."" Do not kiss. Do not show emotion."" Nobody can trust that. Nobody is LIKE that. We are all flawed fuck-ups. 

I run a business, and when I meet with new clients, I NEVER put forth a ""perfect"" face. Why? Because it's untrustworthy. I tell them about my mistakes. ""Oh, yes, this one time, I messed up, and it created this situation. It was quite embarrassing! Of course I discussed it thoroughly with the client, and made sure they were satisfied, and to this day, they are still one of my best clients! So to avoid making a mistake like that with you, here is the system I have in place..."" THAT is how I gain their trust.  You seem to want to come across as perfect. Who could ever live up to that? No woman wants a perfect man. We want a man we can relate to. 

&gt;I am a bit afraid of putting myself out there too soon to a large degree because I might seem self obsessed or not interested in my date.

This is why you share a story, and then ask questions. No one is saying ""monopolize the whole conversation."" Your reluctance to share any information about yourself except for your carefully crafted ""nice guy"" persona is a huge problem. What woman can open up to that? ""I can never tell him about how I used to shoplift, and how I struggle with stress at work. This guy would never understand. I guess we'll just keep it bland and light."" 

Please think about letting people get to know the REAL you.

"Thank goodness. Her reaction sounded like good news to me. It's not a bad thing to get high dowry for those reasons. It's meant to be used for such intentions.

I hope both of you can settle this neatly. We don't really live in the ol' times so I'm sure your partner could have a say in it.

"The teacher is not right. She has no right to tell you what to call your son (unless it's obviously discriminating.) To your son it's probably flattering to be called a little monkey, especially of Curious George is a hero to him. A child doesn't know what racism is. A child can't see the connection between an animal and a political issue. Frankly, there should not be one. Honestly, I think the teacher is the one who's being a racist here, if anyone. Do you think she'd point this out to a 100% white family? I doubt it. I think you should do you. You know what's best for your own son.

"Getting punched by a crazy person doesn't hurt any less than being punched by a sane person. His family has reached their limit. They've been dealing with him for over 20 years; you've only been dealing with him for five. It's good that he's seeking help, but if he stays about the same as he is now, how long can you take it without reaching your limit? You should think long and hard about that before marrying him."
"I'm so happy to see this update, and very glad to see the outcome. I wasn't hoping for you to be gay, or to be straight - I was just hoping you'd take the advice to heart and do some self-reflection.

I'm so proud of you for how you're handling this. I know it's confusing and maybe a bit frightening, but I agree with everything /u/Hippo_Hockey said in the comments.

Embrace who you are - whoever that may be."

"The truth of being an adult is that you will meet people in college/life who are smarter than you (either book smart, emotionally intelligent smart, or socially smart - or a combination of all of them!).  It's very unlikely that you'll go through life always being the smartest, and your competitive nature - although a good thing in many situations - will in some others be a terrible hindrance.  Learning those lessons is part of growing up.  

It's good that you recognize your competitiveness, but here's a chance for you to take your first steps on the adult ladder.  You are considering other people's feelings as well as yours.  Great!

Will a new baby be difficult - yes.  But how you *choose* to deal with it - and as you understand how you're likely to react you can absolutely take the adult road.  Tell your parents how you think you'll feel and work with them together about a coping strategy. 

You sound insightful and articulate about your feelings.  That's a great thing for someone your age!  Be proud of yourself for identifying your feelings and being willing to talk about them.

I'm sure your parents will appreciate your honesty, but even moreso that you can admit that you might have some difficulty with it and that you'd like to deal with that because you want them to be happy.  Maybe suggest a few family counseling sessions to really explore how you and your parents feel,  and like I say, to work on and develop coping strategies for everyone so you can be a great big brother.

Good luck!"
"Honestly, I'm glad it put it into perspective.

My partner of way less time just paid 100% of my way on a vacation that probably cost 800-1k in total. I thanked him every step of the way, but he thanked me right back for going and I offered to do cheaper things/eat cheaper/and stay in cheaper places so I could contribute (which he declined).

Sometimes our partners want us there and they can spend the money and are happy too. In her case not only does she want you there, but also wants to do it in a ritzier way. I'm sure it's not much for her, and she's happy to be vacationing the way she wants."
"No, you are a victim of his wife. It was illegal for her to do that. "
"&gt; He got a flat on his way back from the airport and he blamed me for it because he had to drive me

I'm not trying to be a jerk, but every time you try to explain his behavior you make him sound more and more like an asshole. 

Listen - you're on Reddit so that we'll tell you it's fine if you don't go to the wedding. You don't want to hear that your boyfriend is a walking turd and that you should break up with him. And let's be honest - you probably won't break up with him. But I honestly hope one day when your relationship ends, and it will, you look back at this and take the advice going forward. "
"Your SO is supposed to be your partner, not your dependant. It is is perfectly reasonable to want them to do their share of things so even if she really couldn't get a job she should be doing the housework. But she flat out refuses so buy your family home and get yourself a roommate."
"&gt; The thing is, every time I bring it up to just try and understand what his rationale is, I get made out to be this ""typical woman"" who wants a tight leash on her man.

So do you just drop it after he brings it up? Or how do you respond to him when he says things like that?

&gt; Don't I get a pass from being lumped in with the rest of the world?

What was his answer when you asked him that question?

Edit: I posted this before getting to the end of your OP. 

Holy fuck, girl. 

If this was an arranged marriage but his entire family wanted him to marry his best friend, why didn't they marry?"
"There is a distinct possibility this will alter your current relationship, no matter how nicely you put it, so be prepared for it, but I think you should tell him. If it affects the relationship badly that was a good early test of him as a person and how he deals with tricky situations. He may turn out to be great, too. Good luck!"
"Very inappropriate of him, IMO. How is he otherwise? Have you ever had the chance to see him interact with other women in a casual environment? I'm wondering if this is a side of him that you haven't been exposed to before. "
"OP tell you your mom and aunt about this! This is insane. Why the hell are you protecting them? They betrayed you without any concern for you and your sleeping baby, along with the rest of the family under the same roof. Even if nothing happened (which there is a huge chance there was) then they should be reprimanded for their disrespectful behavior. Don't keep this to yourself !!! Tell your family please"
That is really unsettling. I'd definitely talk to him about it as liking you to be unhealthy is pretty unhealthy. 
"I had one child, wanted, planned with the help of my mom close and 12 months of maternity. 

I still had PPD because of the lack of sleep. "
"I agree that this is probably what's going on. As a woman in a lesbian relationship, I'm constantly combating the idea that one of us is ""the man."" This is especially difficult since my fiancée is more butch looking and I'm (slightly) more girly looking- people expect her to take on the man's role and me to take on the women's role. It's a common problem. 

We both know that there's no man's role or woman's role in either of our relationships. Some people have a weirdly hard time wrapping their heads around that concept. It makes me feel kind of sad for them since that probably means they feel pretty confined to that type of dynamic in their own relationships.

Instead of addressing it outright I often like to just try to subtly subvert gender expectations with my fiancée. For instance, *I* proposed to *her*, and also she'll be walking down the aisle second at the wedding (even though I'm wearing a wedding dress and she's wearing a suit). I also like to make tongue-in-cheek jokes about how I'm ""the man"" in the relationship in front of other people to confuse them. Stuff like that. Unless you're very seriously bothered by the way your father is now treating you, things like this might be better for now. I think as he grows more comfortable with you and gets to know your bf better he'll come to see your relationship dynamic as more complex than the roles he's currently assigning. "
"Not to belittle you at all, OP...but posts like this crop up with regularity.

A new BF/GF essentially accusing their SO and/or SO's relative of incest or incesty-y feelings. Then trying to manipulate the situation and rarely talking it out with their partner, but going behind their partner's back and talking to the relative, who is typically the one posting to r/relationships.

So, don't feel bad? But do tell your brother and remember, you aren't causing a rift. SHE is causing a rift. "
You are terrible at giving advice. Just stop.

"Bro, relax, first off, obviously don't pursue anything with her, its not worth the risk. You are both young and you've been there for her, CONTINUE to be there for her. YOU are her older brother and probably among her best confidants dont make her think you arn't available. You'll go off to uni, meet plenty of pretty girls, probably make plenty of mistakes, YOUR STEP SISTER isn't one of these girls to make those mistakes with.

As you grow older and mature, she'll be your sister, and you'll grow used to that, just dont get hung up on these feelings, enjoy college life, and come home to your sister and be the big brother she loves you to be."

"I doubt anyone here will tell you what you want to hear. 16/19 is rarely ever a good age to have children. One good indicator is the difference in how the father reacted then vs. now when he got his own child; and while I don't know your specific life circumstances, your mom did the right thing, even if she went about it in a less than acceptable way.

Your ex has moved on, which is what you need to do as well. Contacting him will change nothing and will bring nothing good. You can't force him to acknowledge an unborn child he didn't want a bond with in the first place.

You're clinging on to the past and to something you can't change, and you're doing this in a very unhealthy way. That's as far as I'm willing to go in analyzing the problem. The only right course of action at this point, is to see a therapist and get them to help you work through the trauma."

"Thank you so much for your advice. I feel like she is seriously damaged and in some sense, cannot help herself. This was going to be my strategy, but it's just so difficult to be nice to someone so shitty. "
"If you can make it sincere, a simple hug and a ""Thanks mom"" when she does something for you can mean the world, especially if you've been somewhat distant with her lately. It doesn't have to be dramatic, short and casual will do the trick. I learned that lesson with my own mom. 

And pick up the slack when you can. Take charge and cook dinner once in a while as a surprise. Do the dishes without being asked. Take some of the load off instead of just hiding in your room. I understand the impulse, I remember being 19 quite well, but fight it. Your future self will look back on it and thank you."
"Look.  If you don't want to invite them...don't invite them.  Personally though, I don't think it's going to solve anything.  

I'm guessing what you would like most is an acknowledgment and an apology for how they've treated you all these years.  You're angry and hurt and I think you know that they're probably never going to give you that acknowledgement.  Not inviting them to your wedding is simple the grandest most bold way to say FUCK YOU to them that you can in the hope that it hurts their feelings.  

Secretly, I think you want them to grovel and say how sorry they are.  I don't think that's going to happen.

Given how they've treated you, I don't think not inviting them will have the effect you want.  Instead it has the possibility to cause tension and drama with your family.  With how you describe your siblings, maybe they'll cause a huge fuss, spread rumors and then more people won't come because they're turned off by the drama.  

Lastly...it's your wedding.  It's supposed to be a day about love and saying vows to your loved one.  I don't think you're wedding day should be about saying FUCK YOU to your siblings.  As long as they won't make a scene...just invite them and spare yourself the drama.

"So.... he just doesnt like the idea of people (that aren't him) working at a bar if they have children? That's somehow even more illogical... I would bet you there's something he's not saying, or he's lying. Or he's just having a total lapse of judgement, but even that is a bit concerning. His excuses are poor and even if he doesn't say it or know it, they are based in hypocricy."
You won't change their minds. They won't change yours. You can't block them because you don't want to hurt feelings. You are leaving yourself pretty much just one option. Ignore them.

"Having basically been the female in this scenario before, I've had similar thoughts (though have not said them) as your SO.  It's incredibly hard and draining to be in a relationship with a miserable person.  Even when you know they can't control the misery.  The whole thing is so frustrating for both sides.

I don't know that I'd call it abuse, but it does sound like she's hitting a breaking point and lashing out because of it.  Maybe she's even trying to drive you away so that she doesn't have to be the one to end it.  

Either way, if you want to salveage the relationship, get some couples counseling.  "
"I agree with her totally. The fact he went ahead and bought a ticket as a ""surprise,"" while fully knowing he wasn't invited, was an underhanded way of getting what he wants. Plane tickets cost a ton of money to change or cancel usually, so she feels guilty, and he gets his way. If he has the money to buy the ticket, why not plan a trip another time? Or if he has wanted to go to this place so bad, why hasn't he?"
"Don't keep going for another three days, make a reservation at a hotel and tell them you've made a reservation under their name at Hotel X, you'd be glad to help them with your bags.  Unfortunately, you're making them as uncomfortable as they're making you, so you think it would be best for everyone if they stayed elsewhere.  

BEFORE YOU DO THAT, THOUGH.  Talk to your sister in law and tell her about all of this.  Detail it.  The way you tell this story it sounds like she's not even aware of all of this?   Then tell her that it is unfortunate but you'd rather they didn't stay with you for the remainder of their trip.  That you're obviously making them uncomfortable, and they're making you uncomfortable.  "
"She does meet with a therapist (weekly or bi-weekly, I'm not sure) but I don't believe she has been really checked out for this, and I did mention that idea to her previously. Our relationship has always been a little rocky. We always spoke often, but have never been terribly close because we are so different. She has always had a difficult time putting others before herself, but I don't think she realizes it or that she is willing to accept she might be doing something wrong."
That was 7 months ago.
"Not every CPS worker is nice, caring, and helpful. I dealt with them when I was 17 and had two very young sisters. Our case worker lied in court and swept everything under the rug. They told me from the start my sisters would get sent back even though I had countless proof of abuse. At one point, they even locked me in a room with my abusive mom. They made my grandma and child advocate leave the room. The only two people I trusted were forced to leave "
"He was uncooperative with that, but to be fair I had to force him in to it. He said he didn't want to. So I guess it was to be expected. He wanted to work things out on our own, which we ended up doing."

You don't live under a rock do you? Some parents have already let children die because they were so selfish and self absorbed that they refused all medical treatment for herbs and oils that don't do shit. Are you waiting until a kid collapses from not being able to breathe? 

I know this isn't your problem. But you are the only ones who KNOW there is a serious IMMEDIATE danger to these kids. Please stop procrastinating and GET THEM HELP RIGHT NOW. Get off the internet and call the police right now. Call cps RIGHT NOW. "
It's not like I've pinned him down and am tickling him. I agree.. Communication is important. But to get frustrated with me because I am in a lighter mood? I'm not making a joke of it. 
"I'm definitely feeling overworked lately. I guess I'm just resenting that I'm the only one who has to feel that way. I've asked my work to drop my hours before, but they always go right back up within a few months. I've been considering switching companies lately; maybe that will help out with the stress I'm feeling.

I do feel bad, I know how much she loves what she does. Which just makes me all the more jealous since I'm ""meh"" at best about what I do."
"Does this tend to be a large-chested thing? I always see people say how much they hate wearing a bra, but my boobs feel just swell in a bra. I'm small chested, but it certainly makes running up/downstairs much more comfortable, and the bra itself makes my boobs feel 'lovingly cupped', for lack of a better description. Sure, I love stripping off my bra when I have boob sweat going on, but I've never seen anything bad about wearing one so long as it's not hot out, and I buy suuuuper cheap bras, so it's not like I'm wearing anything special. "
People can be *very* good at hiding their abuse. 
I just have never seen someone outright admit that before. I was wondering if he meant something else...
"If that's what you have to say to get him into counseling, do it.  But please knowthat the problem here is NOT your communication, and that it is frankly alarming that the only way you can even attempt to discuss problems with him is by framing them as being totally your fault."

"You do know that the mythical Circe was also not a great person, either, right? That's aside from the fact that no one is going to be able to pronounce her name correctly *No, it's 'sur-see', not 'surs'. No, I'm not named after that horrible GoT character. Circe is a different only moderately awful character in Greek mythology.""*

"You'd have to be a magic master manipulator to think of texting your friend asking where she is because you can see her bf then send a progression of worse messages as you witnessed it happening over a period of time..


You're so right, if she were trying to break them up she would've been saying worse stuff than dancing, laughing and hugging."
"Think about it this way.  Yeah, you're tired when you get home from work.  We all are.

Hanging up your shit and putting your keys in a drawer takes less than five minutes. Washing a dish right after you use it takes less than a minute.  Shoving the toothbrush in the cabinet?  Maybe ten seconds of we're being generous?

And in return, you get a GF who is happy much more of the time. Who stops asking you to move out. Your reward is that you get to *stop having this fight all of the time*.

When you pulled off the sheets, you didn't get brownie points for it because that wasn't what she needed you to do. She needed you to hang up your clothes and put away your keys, as she has said many, many times.

This is an anxiety issue for her, and a pride issue for you.  Really ask yourself if being right about what is normal is worth causing your GF to experience constant low-grade anxiety and frustration in her own home, her safe place, to the point that it visibly affects her mood.  Ask if it takes less time and tears to just hang up your damn clothes than to put her through potentially years of therapy to change something that is a part of who she is."

"Of course he will. If OP's dad insist (and doctor has permission from OP), the doctor will give him paperwork that says ""OP is not an eligible donor"" to OP's dad if he wishes. Willi t specify why? No, but it will be an ""official"" paper. Trust me, I work in a hospital, this stuff happens all the time and crazies come in demanding paperwork and ""proof"". That's what they get and seeing the letterhead and ""official"" words are enough to sate them."
"I'd have to agree with you. I would never talk like that about an innocent person for any reason. That's just cruel. I wouldn't worry so much about the fact he once thought that way about me, I'd worry that he has the kind of character to behave like that toward anyone."
"Dude 75k is not a ""large inheritance"" and nowhere near enough for to start a restaurant. Tell them unequivocally no and if they ask again it'll be a problem with your relationship.

Why is your wife telling her family about the inheritance you got anyway? That's the real problem here "
"Your ""boy""friend is a dick.  He's emotionally manipulating you as a means of controlling you.  this is pretty common in relationships with this kind of age gap.  he clearly doesn't respect you and this kind of slut shaming shows a lack of respect for women in general - which is likely why he needs to date someone younger and less confident - women his age won't tolerate his bullshit.

next time he says he wouldn't date someone like you, say ok and leave."

Single mom of twins advice here:

If she needs help during the day or at specific times, she can hire a mother's helper.  College-aged kids are perfect for this and it really doesn't cost a lot - it's like babysitter rates.  

She can also join your city's local 'mother of twins/multiple' club and they will have tons of resources and help available.

Good luck and I hope she is able to cope better."
"Yeah, I agree with this. I sometimes ask people if they work out or do sports, even if I doubt they do. I just don't want to assume that they don't simply because they're overweight, because to me that would seem to be the more patronizing attitude. "
Why are you dating a 50 year old woman?
"Exactly.  It's pretty obvious OP had a plan and knew what he was doing with his career.  She didn't want to wait for him to be successful in his own way, and instead wanted what was best for her- regardless of whether it was best for OP.  

Breaking up with someone because their ambitions don't match yours is ok, it happens.  Breaking up because they won't change the pace of their ambition to meet personal family and financial goals **even if it hurts their partner** is plain shitty.  She didn't care if you actually enjoyed life, got smarter, or improved your career- she cared if she got the benefits of those improvements.

So now that you can offer those benefits, guess who's back in the picture?  What a surprise.

Also:

&gt;She wanted and still wants a family and her biological clock is ticking, from all appearances I had little - no intention of pursuing that life. (Fairly true I wasn’t interested in starting a family... I want kids just not then and not now)

&gt; She was receiving a lot of pressure from her family to seek someone new who was better educated


If you get back together OP, I can't wait to hear the update post about her trying to force you to have kids before you're ready or buy a bigger house because her family expects it.

"
"The parents have a much different perspective on the situation. They don't want their kids hating each other and they've had to watch this for over a decade. Now one of there children is dying. It's got to be horrible for them.

I probably wouldn't be super comfortable with my SO spending a lot of time drinking and partying with people he'd been sexual with in the past, but I wouldn't slut shame him or anyone else for that matter. You could try talking to your BF to figure out exactly what he's afraid of. Maybe you agree not drinking with your buddies if he's not there, but demanding you cut them off and calling them/you disgusting is not a great sign. Did you give him a heads up about the history in this group? He might have been caught off guard or something, but if this is a super new relationship, you both might be happier just parting ways now. "
"OP, this is what my mother did and it definitely did affect my relationship with her but we have been able to repair it over the years and we are now very close. It still bothers me but although I don't condone her inaction, I understand it. However, if she was still with him, there is no way we would have such a good relationship. I just wanted you to know there is hope that you aren't completely torpedoing your relationship. I'm so sorry you are in this situation but I am very happy that you are actively seeking out help. "

Dr.Smith probably didn't see the value in telling her about her weight again. She knows. He knows she knows. He knows she gets upset and still doesn't change. It's not like he lied about her health. He told her all her health problems. 

Why are you sooooo involved in your sisters private doctor appointments? That's weird and unhealthy. 

And you seemed to like Dr. Smith just fine until he decided to change tactics with a patient of ***his***. It's not your business!

You're way too involved in your sisters life. 

Definitely find a room to rent elsewhere. It can be done cheaply. You need to remove yourself from this situation. You're way too wrapped up in things that are none of your business."

"Your parents refused to support you if you, a 16 year old individual who didn't even have a part time job, went through with the pregnancy. Honestly, I would have done the *exact same thing* if you were my daughter. 

You were not capable of going through with the pregnancy without being homeless, which would have led to the baby being taken away and put into the foster care system. 

So really, it was the right thing for the baby to not be brought into that.

Just because you have functioning reproductive organs doesn't give you the right to have children and force other people to support them.

In your ideal world, your parents would have: paid your hospital bills, possibly 10s of thousands if there were complications, for childbirth, paid for everything the baby needed during the early years of its life, restructured their lives completely or paid for childcare for you to go back to school... those are not fair things to ask of ANYBODY. You could have left, you could have tried going it alone and had the baby.

You didn't because it was the wrong, impossible choice for you to have a baby at that point in time. That has not changed."

"*Someone mentioned Nicole's bday was coming up, so that week, after a small meeting of my graduate commitee, I suggested we all go out for a drink to celebrate Nicoles bday.*

You need to try to remember exactly how you knew it was Nicole's birthday.  

If she did not offer up this information to you personally, it's not unreasonable for her to be wigged out that her husband's student, someone she barely knows, is trying to plan her birthday celebration.  Even more so since you admit that you hang around her husband more than the typical student.

I'm not accusing you of having ulterior motives, but given how this played out it isn't completely far fetched for someone to assume you have some sort of weird obsession with him and/or her.

As for how to address it from here on out, I think you should limit your communication with everyone involved to strictly business.  Not that you have much choice, given what the Chairman told you.

Don't show a sniff of interest in their life or opinions outside of your program.  From your post I can tell that you have a tendency to babble a bit, so be vigilant about not saying ANYTHING that could be taken the wrong way.

"I talked to her about this because I feel the same. Like, I get that she's clean. And I get that by her standards I'm messy. But we're in a relationship and want a future together. That can't happen if we don't live together.

She said that in her eyes I'm not even trying to compromise. She says she doesn't want me to move out permanently, just until I can show her that I can be clean. I asked if I could do that while still living here, and she said she's already given me 5 months to show that I can be clean, and apparently I've failed at that. 

I just don't really know what I can do. I thought I *was* being clean. Yeah, she'll ask me to put stuff away, and she'll ask me to remember to do the dishes when I make dinner or something, and sometimes I see her ""fixing"" things I've done, but she's never really said much besides a little talk here and there. And then yesterday she just totally blew up. I've never seen her lose her cool like that in 2 years of dating. She's always the calm, ""talk it out"" type. That's why I thought at first that something bad must've happened at work or she was just super stressed out. But she still wants me to move out."

"With respect, though, saying it makes you uncomfortable is not unpacking this issue. What is it that makes you uncomfortable about receiving an expensive gift? What is the reason for that uneasy/squirming feeling, whether the gift is from your parents or gifrlfriend or anyone else?

Maybe you feel like there's an unwritten expectation of something from you, when someone gives you a big gift?
Maybe you feel like the scales are out of balance, and you need to be able to give something big back, but you can't?
Maybe you don't like not being in control/in power in a relationship, and if someone gives you something worth a lot, it takes some power away from you?
Maybe it goes against your foundational sense of egalitarianism/equality, anti-elitism, that you should be the receiver of a huge gift? 


Could it help at all to imagine yourself wanting to give a gift to a much poorer girlfriend, say you had a girlfriend who was unemployed, but you loved her and wanted to travel with her. How would you see the issue if she said she didn't want you to pay to stay in Air BnB's because she could only afford camping in tents? Would you say cool let's camp or would you try to convince her to let you pay for hostels/Air BnB's?"
"This is too much drama for one week.  There's still a good chance that she's not pregnant or that it isn't yours.

Don't have sex with her anymore, at all.  If she's lying about being pregnant, she could be trying to get pregnant.

Stop ""dating"" her.  Spend the night at her place?  Bring her dinner?  Driving her six hours roundtrip for shopping?  She's not your GF.  She was just a hookup.  Don't let her make it out to be more.

Don't give her money, buy her stuff, or do her any favors.  Take her to the clinic and pay for that.  Otherwise, save your money in case you need to deal with legal bills and support.  

Stop having contact with her.  Tell her, ""Listen, I'm not in the market for a GF.  Let me know if you need a ride to have an abortion or if you're giving birth."". Say it as politely as you can manage, just in case you do have a baby together.  But don't let her manipulate you."
"Your manager stole your wallet and there was video footage?  Thats a criminal case right there, you should have gone to the police and reported the theft."
"Your wife is being and has been deliberately excluded from your family. I feel terribly sad for her, she probably hoped that after her relationship with her mum she might be able to forge a new one and instead is blocked at every turn and treated as though she's the problem."
"&gt; if my SO said ""its me or literally everyone else you love"" I know what I'd choose.

Even if they're all total assholes? "
"Little hard truth here: he doesn't care about you. 

Chasing after him and trying to confront him will only empower him. Move on. Swallow the pain and look forward to future relationships that aren't going to be such a headache. 

He broke up with you rather than just cheating behind your back. Take comfort in the fact that you acted in a way that made him respect you enough as a person to do that. But cut him out of your life; he's lost that right. Respect yourself. Good luck. "
"&gt;I decided that the person I've been seeing is just mean.

Yep, I'd say that about sums it up.

&gt;I cannot stand this. If she's serious and is willing to change, I don't know if I still want to break up with her.

Right now she's in panic mode &amp; willing to promise you the moon. Why? Probably because *you* dumped *her* and she can't stand it. Take her back &amp; she'll be mean again, I promise.

No, it hurts, but hold firm. You can find another girlfriend. A nice one, this time."
"&gt; Wow. Your sister told you that your father abused her, and you defended him, told her to ""keep the family together"", and didn't acknowledge her feelings or how wrong her was, at all.

I wonder how often OP would do this in another context. 

""My husband hit me.""

""Oh, it's okay, he was going through a hard time! You should stay and keep the family together. I mean, you can't prove it and he denies it, so you should stay."" 

"
"She's got this idea of what a relationship should look like, and she is upset you are not conforming to her vision. Her vision seems to include you driving her around. Without a car, you lack the ability to perform to her vision. She may also see it as a status symbol.

Expect this to continue. This is a woman who has an idea of what your relationship and your lives togeather should look like. This isn't going to stop when you get a car. There will be further expectations, and further fights when you don't meet them."
"Yeah, I agree. I forgot about how she used to steal my makeup until someone in this thread reminded me. She has it because I live close to her and sometimes I need her to walk my dog but, not worth it."

"It sort of sounds like to me that this friend is in love with your future wife, and your fiancé doesn't want to tell you that's why they've been fighting because you'd likely ask her to terminate the friendship. The fact that they seem a little too close, and the friend seems to not want to be around you, is sort of sketchy. Maybe your fiancé isn't attracted/interested in her, but likes the attention? Either way, the behavior is  inappropriate.

 Just my two cents. "
He had the authority when the bike was in his possession and the sign had his number 
Your only options are cutting her out of your life or she comes over three times a WEEK to talk shit about your husband? How about decreasing those visits

He thinks he's helping. He's 80. Fat people weren't really a thing when he was growing up.
I wonder if he already has explored incest...
"Hey. I'm sorry I haven't responded to anyone. I do appreciate all the replies. I wrote this on a break at work and couldn't find time to check back. After work, I checked my phone and there was a message from Tom as there always is after work. It killed me because it was about him and Dave catching more pokemon. As I was putting my phone back in my bag, he rang. I panicked and ended the call. Then I drove to the park and sat and watched birds for a few hours while crying. I'm just so so confused! 

I didn't feel like I could settle on a course of action (not tonight anyways) so I went to the shops and bought some overnight stuff and went to my sister's house. I'm going to spend the night here. I had her call and tell him that she needed an emergency overnight babysitter (she's a night nurse so this excuse worked). I'm dreading tomorrow. I can't avoid him forever. "
I tried to type something about the age difference and all I could think was yuck. It's really hard for me to imagine him seeing you as anything but a very young girl who's willing to have sex with him. And likely he's looking for others.
"Dude the reality is she's Russian, and she's right about translations. Forget the poetry thing, it is literally meaningless to her, particularly as Russian is a much richer language than English. The music thing, honestly I would get too. I've had guys play songs for me before. The problem is when it's a partner, if you don't like the music they take I incredibly personally. It might not even be bad, just not to your taste, but if you don't completely love it, even the most secure partner can get a little upset. I've had experiences in the past that would put me off listening to a partners music again"

"If she's the really logical type, I feel like you could frame the conversation that if you lost her, especially soon, you'd be left with a REALLY TEENY BABY to care for and no wife. And if you still had a wife, you guys could make another baby. But she carried the baby for nine months and you only just met him a month ago, you know? It makes sense to me that you'd choose your wife over your son. 

I think if I were in that situation, not having any kids, I'd save the father of our kid instead of our kid. When my fiance and I had this hypothetical discussion (slightly different, but mine was asking how animal mothers always want to protect their babies--and that if an animal was being attacked and so were her babies, maybe she should just sacrifice one baby to the predator and then run away with the other babies) he told me my answer showed I was not ready to be a mom, and we both agreed that that was the case. 

But yours is real life and tough because you just became a parent. I think you were in the right to communicate honestly, and it makes me sad that she wasn't happy with your honest response (which is what she asked to hear) simply because it isn't in line with her own. Hopefully the two of you are able to keep communicating, because now there's a whole extra life you will have to make complicated constant compromises about (whoa, that was hard to type out).

I hope you're able to smooth this over with her, best of luck friend! And congratulations on your new baby :)"
"I didn't downvote it, but the comment isn't particularly constructive either. It's not offering advice or answering OP's question about how he can deal with his wife. "
"So, if you give up your job to satisfy his never-before-revealed worries, what happens when he becomes concerned when you leave the house after dark? Good married women don't do that, right? Better stop. He's pretty insistent. And then, when you stop doing that, to satisfy his new worries, he'll decide it's really dangerous when you go out with just your girl friends, women out alone are a concern, amiright? He'll be insistent. Better stop going out at all.

Giving in to his unreasonable demands to minimize his anxieties doesn't stop the anxieties. They aren't based on you, or your actions, or your job, or anything other than the issues in his head. Don't start down this path."
"You haven't heard from your wife in several *weeks* and you haven't had someone (for example, Julie) physically go to your house to find her?"
"Yeah OP I think you're actually focusing **too much** on the kiss.

If you ask me, your girlfriend continuing to hang out with this guy, after he flirts non-stop and makes **actual, physical attempts to hook up with her**? That's SO much worse.

Yeah, OK, she ""finally"" gave into his 4th advance.

....why the fuck was there a 4th advance?

You want to know what I would have done the fucking FIRST time he asked?

&gt; Whoah whoah, I think you have a MAJORLY wrong idea about what's going on here between us. I have a boyfriend, and he is your friend. The fact that you would even ask to kiss me - your friends girlfriend - is disgusting. You know I have to tell him that you made a move on me right?

And I'm not even exaggerating, that's what I would have said the **FIRST fucking time** he made his intentions known.

You know what she did? She waited 4+ times, and *then just ended up kissing him*. 

Why the fuck did she not shut this down SO much sooner?

I mean honestly.... the kiss is just the absolute least of my worries in this whole post. It's the fact that you can't trust your girlfriend to get out of situations like that before they escalate.

She had COUNTLESS opportunities to **100% flat out shut him down**. She didn't. 

(And then yeah, the cherry on top of the shit sundae is that she ended up kissing him. After all that bullshit, all the opportunities to stop it, to make her intentions clear, to let you know what was going on, to stop hanging out with him, to stop hanging out with him **alone**...)

How do you trust someone after something like this? Every time she goes out with her girlfriends I'm going to be wondering if there's some persistent guy who's eventually just going to wear you down and you'll cheat, again. 

&gt; She confessed that she met him a few times in secret

She lied to your face about who she was hanging out with. You don't lie if there's nothing wrong about what you're doing.

&gt; Suddenly, he asked her to go on a hiking trip without mentioning anything to me.

This is just weird to me. If I introduced my girlfriend to some guy, and they started excluding me from our hangouts so that they could go be alone without me?

&gt; . It also bothered me that they would go to the hot spring and give each other massages

...and then while they were alone, without me, they would get physical with eachother? (Not sexual, but still... wtf... don't rub my girlfriend dude. Ew.)

You know it's funny I didn't even see that part when I first read through this post.... 

....they gave each other massages? What the fuck? This is almost worse than the kissing... Just rubbing their hands all over each other. Surely moaning and groaning because who doesn't love a backrub?

&gt; A few weeks later, they go on another hiking trip, and they're back at midnight (hot spring included). 

This is **SOO FUCKING WEIRD TO ME!** Like, I get it, they can hang out, you're cool with that.. ...but why were you just suddenly DROPPED from the hangouts? What the fuck?

&gt; I confronted her about yesterday, and asked her once more if there's anything I should know. She spilled everything.

I'll give her credit for fessing up to it. But she should have told you the first time he asked to kiss her. And the second time. And the third time. And when he started touching her leg. And when he asked the 4th time. She LET this whole thing happen. You shouldn't have to ask if she cheated on you, that's fucking stupid. What if you wouldn't have pressed it? Would she have kept hanging out with him? What if you weren't suspicious at all, would she have fucked him next time? And the way you phrase it makes it seem like it didn't just come out naturally. This is something you had to bring up more than once to find out what was going on.... why?

Sorry OP - I just can't imagine a scenario in which I would be like ""Oh, hell yeah, I'll stay with this girl!"". How about no?"
"Even under civil law, you aren't allowed to ransom people's belongings for a debt. These are separate issues.

Return the cuff links for the karma, use that (potential) goodwill to open discussion about the debt.

Either way, you lose nothing by giving them back, and good deeds elevate the soul."
"I'd say the fact that he slipped in the almond thing at the end after a whole page of ""my fiance left me SUDDENLY and for NO REASON and I'm just DEVASTATED,"" makes it pretty clear that it is, in fact, his fault. I mean, bearing the hatred and spitefulness of your SO's family is bad enough, but for your SO to then not have your back at all with those people would be absolutely unbearable. 

It's pretty obvious that OP is delusional in thinking that his family didn't change the menu to spite her. He demonstrated that he had zero intention of taking her side, even in the case of a blatant affront. I mean honestly, OP, if she can't rely on after something like this, what exactly would someone have to do to get you to stand up for the woman you supposedly want to spend the rest of your life with? 

She really killed it in the noping-the-fuck-out-of-there department, and I'd bet good money there are other stories behind this one that we'll never get to hear about. 

EDIT: And I get that you're still a wreck after a month. That's totally normal when your life gets blown to pieces. But it's also crystal clear that you had this coming. "
"&gt;Both are using me as a mediator to yell at each other,

No. You are choosing to serve as a mediator, and that is why you are in this mess. No more back and forth. If they want to talk to each other, they do it themselves, not through you. 

It is not your job to smooth things out or fix this. Lynn overstepped, your brother and his SO are sick of her shit. Why are you even involved? Just say no.

ETA also Kyle should have told Lynn he didn't want to go instead of asking you to suggest it. He could have said ""I wouldn't be comfortable being the only man there,"" and moved on with life."
Normally it would be none of your business but she put your health at risk with this critical lie by omission so that's really really bad.
"Your wife wants to name your daughter after a woman who commits incest, was abused by her husband, gave birth to three children of incest, had sex next to her dead child's body, was a key part of in the destabilization of a kingdom, burned a thousand people alive, and destroyed half of the capital for her own ends. She facilitated her pyscopathic son, went against her only sane sibling, manipulated, lied, and betrayed everyone she could, broke her marriage vows with her own brother and cousin, and in general is a terrible human being. 

In the last episode, she **ACTIVELY FACILITATES, PERMITS, AND ENCOURAGES THE RAPE AND TORTURE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.**

Let me repeat that. Your wife wants to name your daughter after someone who actively perpetuated rape, torture, manipulation, and brutality. Like, if you wanna name your kid Darth Vader, or Palpatine, or idk, Bellatrix, get right on that. 

That's the kind of legacy you put your daughter with. It's not funny, it's not cute, and it's your daughter's future she's messing with. It's not 'a bit of fun', it's a terrible thing to do to her. I mean, I know the films and the tv shows my parents grew up with, my children will know the ones I grew up with. People are going to know her name's origin and it's just... skeevy. "
"Just hearing that I am helpful as is, is wonderful. Thank you! &lt;3"
Plus not talking to your spouse for a week. That is not healthy or normal behavior.
"So...yeah, your approach to this is all wrong.  Talk to your gf when she calms down.  Apologize for not communicating; don't keep making excuses like you're doing here.  Actually mean it.  See if that helps."
"If you need to cut out contact with him for the time being you have the right to do that. He put his sexual needs before your marriage and having done that, you do not owe him anything.

If you're going to marriage counseling you are better off using that as a tool to deal with this, rather than this sub. You sound very upset by all of this, and rightfully so. Personally I'd recommend you separate yourself from him for the time being and do something to make yourself feel better. Your self esteem seems to be at an all time low and I think doing something to make you happy could make a big difference.

Best of luck, hope you're able to work things out to your liking."
"""Dear Diary, today from my high horse I asked a bunch of strangers how to deal with the anger issues of the man I'm cheating on my husband with. He seems to be unreliable  with his time frames and blows up at me whenever I ask him why it took so long to sneak away from his family and his role as husband and father so that we can catch a flick and flick my bean. They were mean to me. I can't imagine why. I am an outstanding person with high moral fiber. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. I think I'll teach in high school and start sleeping with my students from here on out."""
Me too. Such a good excuse for explaining where you were.
"Good update, but as for the proposal? I don't think that on the back of this entire situation, that was a good idea. Even if you really wanted to propose, you should have waited at least a few months."
"I'm sorry that this is bothering you so much. There are a few things I would focus on that might help me feel less insecure, if I were in this situation: 

1. ""I'm the type of person that has a few close friends and I've always been happy with that."" Are your friends good friends and good people? Good friends are rare and hard to come by. If you've always been happy with your friends, just keep reminding yourself what you appreciate about them. 

2. You're getting married! Someone loves you so much that he's about to make this huge commitment to you. At the end of the, day no matter how many people were at your wedding, you are now part of a team that can face the world together. 

3. You can't control other people. If your parents don't have a lot of siblings and aren't extroverted, that's not a statement about you. Do you love your parents? Are you happy they will be at the wedding? 

4. Finally, weddings are hugely expensive. A big wedding would cost more. If you prefer the the idea of intimate weddings, whenever you start to feel unhappy, remind yourself what it is that you like about the idea of a small wedding. If that doesn't help, remind yourself that you don't have to provide food and entertainment for one thousand people. 

5. And finally, have you thought about where these feelings are coming from? What's making you feel insecure? Are you looking at pictures of other peoples' weddings or checking people's Facebook friend count? Is it because your fiance has a big extended family? Have you talked to your fiance about how you feel to get his perspective on the situation? I'm guessing that by now he knows you pretty well, he may have some insight and reassurance. 

Also: weddings are just kind of stressful, and since it sounds like everything about yours is going to be great, maybe this is the outlet you've found to let loose some anxiety."
"Long engagements can dwindle people's excitement. You can't make people excited for you, you should just focus on planning your wedding and being excited for yourselves. Once they realize your wedding is actually happening, they will probably get more excited."
Yup. They don't support your marriage or the way that you are planning to live your life. Any future children you have will be a huge fight after this because they'll insist on baptisms and Catholic rearing of them. Will they not support them in their decisions either? I'd look at this wedding as a sort of an expectation of future experiences.

"Why do you feel this conversation ""needed to happen""?  Why do you need to know this guys boundaries?  This is pretty inappropriate and it seems like you're just setting something up for the future.  There's really no real reason for you to have done any of this.

You definitely need to tell your husband, and he'll likely not want to hang out with David any more because...well....this is really inappropriate."
I think what /u/jpallan meant was that girls are partial to buying cheap perfume for themselves.
"A wedding is probably one of the worst places for someone with anxiety in my opinion. There's so much pressure to socialize and be 'fun', which can make a wedding seem more like an ordeal rather than a party. This is made worse when you see everyone else having fun but your body is screaming at you to leave and be alone. It can be hard to understand if you haven't experienced it yourself. "
So someone went through a lot of work to send you that letter. Is it possible that it's an old ex who's trying to get back at him?
"I wouldn't risk it. He will likely escalate. He loves to control you, and to use you as a punching bag. So when you suddenly get out of his control, he will try everything possible to get you back under his control. He will likely also gaslight you, and love bomb you, and tell you how sorry he is and that he is changing, making promises... Don't believe him. You need to prepare for escalation in the form of violence, or love bombing and promises, or both."
"I have a very poor opinion of those who feel entitled to others' money, with the exception of comparison legacies (i.e. Brother inherited everything). However, if I were you, I would keep your eye on the prize, namely, your cousin whose college fund you contribute to. Forget her ungrateful parents. If you must, find the biggest family gossip and spill your guts, but don't let this fester. Your contribution is practically a scholarship amount. And if they needed funds specifically from you, the right thing to do would be to approach you privately and directly with a repayment plan."
"Or be vindictive, get the boob job THEN break up with him."
Future wife included? ;)
"Jesus. I am honestly not sure what to advise. You should be in therapy (you should have **already** been in therapy, actually). You should be *extremely* wary of your brother, for probably a really long time. I can't believe he did that to you. Your father and your brother owe you huge apologies, but I don't really know how someone gets past a betrayal of this magnitude. 

Let me ask you this: what do you *want* to do? Do you want to go back to either school? Someplace else entirely? Have you and your mom and sister started talking about college plans?"
"Dude. You cheated on your fiancé with this woman, and you think that inviting her to your wedding I appropriate? Absolutely not. Do what you will, but you're going to have to choose who matters more to you, and I hope for your weddings sake it's your soon to be wife. 

Edit: so I decided to read his over again, and honestly, you probably shouldn't marry this woman. 1. you cheated on her, 2. You continued to be friends with the woman you cheated on her with, 3. You actually believe it's reasonable to argue with her over the fact she doesn't want to look at your walking infidelity at her wedding, and 3. You threw her under the bus and painted her as somehow unreasonable to your mother. It seems like you need to think loooong and hard about yourself. "
"This seriously sounds like a college prank gone wrong. Hell how many movies from the 80's especially showed peeping in the showers or panty raids as great pranks. If it bothers you that much why not ask the brother directly to explain what happened. Also educate yourself on local statues. Sounds like you live in an area that has a low threshold of what goes on the list. 

**edited to add. Also have a conversation with the wife about it further as well. The this is a family matter line. Really you two are family now about to add a third. With this out there you found it it's completely possible for other people to find it. You will eventually be bringing lots of kids into your home for bday parties ETC. If she wants her brother to play then uncle and he's going to be there you should be in the know and have an understanding to speak to it if and when it comes up. It's better for you to be prepared rather than be surprised. "
"The term is ""deep seated"".

So weird that this is coming up so often in /r/relationships lately."
"It doesn't make a difference. He was someone you loved and someone you planned on marrying. It doesn't matter if you were physically intimate with him or not. The emotions were -- and are -- still there. 

Tom was most likely a wonderful person. However, that does not negate your husband's feelings on naming your son after him. Find some other way to cherish his memory.  "
"&gt; So Becca just texted me and said, ""So what do we do about this?""

""I'm going to dinner and then the festival with [Other Friend], you can do whatever you want.  I'd appreciate it if you came but if you have to entertain guests because they can't be left alone then I understand.  I know you wouldn't miss my birthday unless it was important.""

Don't make excuses or give reasons, it doesn't matter and they'll only be torn apart or used to create a loophole."
"You've probably just heard it a lot of times in your life, the general consensus with glasses wearers is that the leaves are the first thing you notice. "
"If you let him stay for 4 weeks he will be that much harder to get rid of. Tell him he has to leave, now. He's taking advantage."
"If you and the co-worker have kissed thats going to be a massive red flag for your boyfriend and probably the major reason with the jealousy and his request.... add you and ur coworkers flirting when ur away and its probably got his mind full of what could be happening when ur away......
Depending how long you have been together he may not trust you completely yet and the drinking with a co-worker who flirts and has kissed u before will definitely be causing issues.
I'm sure if the roles were reverse you would be feeling very uncomfortable about the situation. If you guys can't resolve this with boundaries and mutual respect it will tear you apart and based on your post op i don't think you want this.
You need to communicate openly and calmly with him. He has valid reasons for his feelings. He doesn't have any right to tell you what to do.... nobody does!!!
But you also have to respect that hes not okay with this situation at work with what you've said. Does he know about the kissing and flirting?"
"The more of your comments I read, the more I think you should really look into some counseling to help you learn how to establish and stick to boundaries with your mom,"
"Keep them. If they're first gens they'll sell a lot more later on, not right now and you're not that tight on finances. But you have to preserve them nicely and not let a toddler use it who might not gently handle them. Your mom's call. "
"Ugh. She is so cringey in the worst way. Honestly, I am a nurse. I could not be friends with this girl. She simply does not get how much you go through to be a doctor. Also she probably feels inadequate in some way with low self esteem or a total narcissist to say shit like that. I have a coworker who acts like that. And she's in her 50's.  Glad I work opposite her because I wouldn't be able to handle hearing all day how smart she is (with her many letters and certifications after her name after she signs anything). I couldn't handle hearing her disrespect the amazing docs we work with. Sure residents don't know it al. They are fucking learning!!!!!! Ahhhhhh. Your friend is a twat. 

I would probably just pull a slow fade on her and blame it on school. She will think your a ""fucking stuck up Doctor wanna be who is too good to be friends with a nurse"". But that's ok. Because she's a horrible person. "
I think it was more he was looking for someone inexperienced and easy to manipulate. :/
It's not cheating but it is disrespectful. If that's the deal-breaker for her then that's what it is even if she sort of calls it the wrong thing.
Your usual guy talk may not be everyone's usual guy talk. You seem awfully cagey about what *exactly* you were saying.
"So let's say you keep the status quo.  Do you really think after you get married to her, they're just going to say ""Oh, OK, guess we'll stop controlling her now.""

You'll be signing up for a lifetime of battles just to live your life.  If/when you have kids.  What they would be names.  How and where you take vacations and celebrate holidays.  All of these will be a fight every single time.

She needs to nip it in the bud or you need to bail.  It's going to suck either way.  Sorry."
"I really like getting these updates, especially when they turn out well."
"This is going to be one long, sad story is you don't pull it together right now.  

You've got to think about your baby. Dad had his chance to be an adult, and it sounds like he failed. It's so insulting that he thinks he can grub off of his *pregnant* unmarried daughter.  Damn. If anyone needs support right now, it should be you.

Let your inner momma bear out and set some boundaries - number one being NO MONEY FOR DAD. The car loan is not for him. The debts he has accumulated are not yours. From now on, every time he talks about money, say loudly and clearly ""I'm saving all MY money for the baby.""
"
"Toys, car, computer, college fund... The works. The guy needs a **very** hard dose of reality. "
"Clearly she invited him because he's poodle-gay and she thinks it's cute. She sees him as a novelty.

It's gross. "
"&gt; In a nutshell, she told me as soon as we moved into a home that my ex-wife did not formerly occupy we could get married and build our home together. This is so her and her kids could feel like it was their home too.

This is reasonable.  Your house will always be your house, it will never be ""both of your"" house.  Same goes for the kids.

&gt; My girlfriend on the other hand has been a single mom for years and has always struggled. She and her girls have moved from apartment to apartment and have changed schools and even cities many times. I'm not sure they even know what a real home feels like.

Its funny how you think your abstract, subjective feelings about your ""home"" are perfectly reasonable but hers are irrational and unreasonable.

&gt;  I am wrong to stick to my guns for my kids? 

You arent doing anything ""for your kids"", you are using them as an excuse to get your way.

Why not sit down with your GF and all the kids and ask what they think.  Explain you want to get married and move in together but don't want to ruin their relationships with each other.  See how they would feel about all moving into a new house.  Are there any areas they would like to move to?  Consult with them and do it jointly and together."
"It's pretty clear that you're not psychologically prepared to shift to an open relationship, physical or emotional. So let's cut to the chase. You and your wife can attempt marriage counselling to address the attention deficit she's feeling and/or you see a lawyer to prepare for the eventuality that your marriage ends. Your wife has one foot out the door. Because you've been waffling in your acceptance of her outside interests I can tell you it's almost inevitable she'll cheat on you and claim after the fact that she thought you said you were cool with it (even though we all know this is twisting words and events). If you keep digging your head into the sand as you have been you are going to get even more badly hurt than you think you are right now."
"You're not wrong at all, but how on earth can she wrap her head around ""if you want this to work you'll likely need to work on having more frequent/passionate sex with this lying prostitute visiting dude?""

I just can't see it. If I can take a wild stab, I'd guess that in his mind this was 'better' than having an affair or leaving her, it was his way of dealing with his perceived lack of sex life rather than talk to her about it, or possibly leave if he was that unhappy."
This makes me feel a little better. If you don't mind me asking - how and at what point did you tell your husband that (you thought) you couldn't have kids? And how long since the original scarring did you go before getting pregnant? I.e. can it get better/worse with time etc?
"You say above its not an arranged marriage but there are some parallels. You weren't involved romantically and got married on a kind of transactional basis. Lots of people in history have done that and ended up in love.  So it's not surprising. 

Ok I'm curious, now that you have fallen in love, what is the ""more"" you are looking for?

Commitment to only be with you forever? (Sounds like you are already in a monogamous marriage)

Sex? (Sounds like you have a sexual relationship)

For her to have your babies? (Sounds like that's on the table)


You now are in love, so is it those specific feelings you want her to reciprocate? I am guessing if she was willing to commit only to you for life she does love you in some way. Her saying she doesn't get those feelings may be true (in which case this may be as close as she can come feeling wise) or it may be a form of protection from vulnerability. Worst case scenario, she's closeted.

I say talk about it with her but go into it with an idea of what you would want. She may just be a really practically minded/objective kind of person and would need concrete examples. ""I'd like to hold hands on line at the movies"" ""I'd like you to look in my eyes when we have sex"" ""I'd like you to say in words why you are glad we are married sometimes"". 

And if she truly could never reciprocate would that be really ok with you?

"Your wife isn't mad about your advice, she's mad about your intolerance, as she has explained to you.
&gt; I see it as a sexual incompatibility, if my wife were to ever ask for a threesome, then we simply have different views on sharing our sex life with other people.

You're treating ""vague, unspecified interest in a threesome"" as a full-blown sexual incompatibility? How would *one* question about a potential sexual interest outweigh *all* of the years you have spent with your wife, presumably sexually happy? At the very least, your sexual chemistry must be much weaker than your wife realizes if a single suggestion for something you aren't interested in would be enough for you to ignore all the sexual compatibility you two have found.

Raising a question about a sexual interest *does not* mean that it is a sexual requirement. You are allowed to have your own sexual boundaries, but they should not extend into *discussion* of sexual interests. Why wouldn't you give your wife the chance to accept ""no threesomes"" as a price to be with you? Would you treat other sexual activities you're not interested in the same way?"

I got harassed for 10 years because I decided to only have one kid. 

I still have to hear nasty untrue bullshit about how terrible only children are. This subreddit loves to harp on it a lot. But I am not nasty to those who have zero or several kids. 

But there are some people who take being child free to a really horrid level of hate. 

Sounds like OP's coworker is one of them. 

Like not having children is it's own hobby."
"&gt; She gave you the perfect out. 

Plus, any bridesmaid who gains more than 5 pounds is out, right? OP, you're *thisclose* to freedom. Although I'm sure she just expects you to lose the baby weight before the big day (ugh).

Seriously, this girl is nuts. I know people who are high-maintenance but kind, so I get that she wants a nice (albeit insanely expensive) wedding. But she's shitting all over OP's wedding and her cousin's wedding and making ludicrous demands. I'd tell her no, full stop. She has a $60K budget, she can afford to buy a cake and mini cakes from a commercial baker -- which is what you need for a project of that size, a commercial kitchen. Amy should bail too and refuse to provide hair/nails/whatever else to that brat.

There's lovably high-maintenance and then there's this girl. She's a rude, ungrateful brat, and her parents are liars and thieves."

Cps is not going to take a child away because it's mother feeds him too much junk food. And odds are the sister in law will put two and two together and figure out who called and she may remove the child from the life of op and her family.

Sorry, but I kinda think that the fiancee dropped the ball here. This is **his** family and **his** pregnant sister. Why the hell is all the wedding planning on OP's shoulders?

"Sigh. People.

In HR, though not super familiar with your state. Normally, when adding a non compete, you have to give the employee something in exchange. Either a raise, a bonus or something significant.

Any risk from listing out a bunch of classes, giving them right of first refusal and putting them on yourself if they say no?"
"Clearly, you guys have different boundaries on what is acceptable behavior and what is not. Neither of you are in the wrong for this. 

Yeah, he could have handled it better. But frankly, I understand why he got so upset. From the post you kind of made it seem this is literally the first time he has met your friends. And what happens? He gets to learn all about your sexual past with them and on top of it he gets to hear all about theirs. Something tells me, you never told him any of these things. Or even warned him that you have a ""more than friends"" history with them. So, basically, he gets blindsided by it. 

Again, I think he could have found a better way to handle it. But, you could have handle things better too and maybe given him a little warning that this is how you are with your friends and the history you have with them. 

It doesn't sound like you will ever be compatiable with each other. And that makes for a bad relationship. You might want to seriously consider ending the relationship and trying to find someone who has similar stances and boundaries about these things as you. However, for that to happen, you shouldn't just surprise them with it either. Maybe give any future SO a heads up that you and your friend group are ""incestuous"" and that you all like to reminiscence about it from time to time also. 

And just for the record in case it matters to you: My husband and I have an open relationship. And we are both pretty open about sex, very sex positive and things like that...but even *I* would likely have a problem if I was confronted with something like this completely without any proper warning.

"Yeah sorry. There is a societal belief that men can't be victims of this. It's of course absurd and illogical but it's there nevertheless. I'd suggest filing a police report, include both that you believe you were drugged and that this girl had sex with you while you were unconscious. It's possible that she was not the one who spiked your drink but took advantage of it so she's still in the wrong.

Sorry to say, but you should expect for tests to not show traces of drugs at this point, they leave your system very quickly. And proving that consent was not given can be difficult without the evidence of drugs being present. That's the unfortunate reality of the situation and food for thought if you want to pursue something here. Best of luck."
"Um, it's not at all understandable she is going nuclear over a photo from 10 years ago (and seemingly before you were even together and possibly before you even knew her...). Put a foot down, man.

"Maybe I'm in the wrong, and either way, I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for this, but it takes 10-20 seconds to send a text. When he sent you the picture, ""Aw cute! Hey I'm busy right now, but I'd love to talk later!"" 10 seconds, it shows you value him in your life, while affirming that you are busy. Now I'm not saying people should always text back immediately, but it sounds like he did so in the AM and it was quite a time later and you still hadn't. He sounds like he's just really into you and that shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. You say you have a great time with him and if you're attracted to him and connect with him I don't see a problem with him. He's probably had a lot of failed attempts at dating girls that he liked and seemed like it was going somewhere, that later ghosted him. Don't change who you are, but maybe try to see things from his perspective.

"I've made it clear in other comments that I won't be hanging out with him. Can he give my phone a ring if he ever needs anything? Absolutely. Will I got hang out with him on a personal level? No. The number one reason I am not completely shutting the door is because we have a mutual circle of friends in the climbing community. I'm not going to exhile myself to avoid him. I wouldn't let him drag out his unwanted feelings for that long. If he were to continue trying to justify his actions and asking for me back (he hasn't since I asked him not to) I would have to cut him off in respect for my newly found hunk. I'm an idiot, not a hypocrite. 
"
"&gt; I was trying to be nice to her because she's not in the area very often and I want her to feel wanted (she feels left out a lot because she lives so far from her family) and I hate upsetting people. 

This is the crux of the problem right here.  This is how you allow yourself to be manipulated. You are holding yourself responsible for someone else's feelings. 

You are not responsible for how your aunt or mother feels. If, for example, your aunt decided to get butthurt at you for not giving away a thing of yours willy nilly, wow, that would be pretty insanely entitled, wouldn't it? 

Supposing I walked up to your door and asked you if I could have your television? That would be nuts, right? 

Here's a script for you: 

""I'm so sorry you came all the way over here. Mom misunderstood; I never actually offered &lt;thing&gt;."" 

If they push you, just repeat, ""No, I'm not giving that away. That was Mom who said that, not me,"" or, ""I have no idea why Mom would say that withough asking me. That's pretty crazy, don't you think? Who even does that?"" Etc.  

Let the situation be awkward until they go away, or you make some excues about how your busy. 

For bonus points, you could call your mother up while the person is standing there and say, ""Cousin It is here asking for my favorite shoes. As we both know, I never offered to give them away. Why don't you explain to her why you did that,"" and hand Cousin It the phone. "
"Seriously, you are not at all responsible for other people's reactions to you simply being an attractive, friendly young person, in your own home nonetheless. Wear whatever you want, now and always! Anyone who can't handle that is backwards AF and can't take responsibility for themselves and their own situation."
"Not sure if serious, but babies grow exclusively in women."
"And get your own, OP. Don't let your dad ""help"" you pick one."
I'm still crossing my fingers that she leaves you.
"If you let this persist it will never get better. I honestly think you should bail but if you decide to stay you need to stop giving until it becomes equitable. Because right now she has the life, she gets off 3-4 times a week with no effort. Even a good nature person would have trouble changing that. So either bail or set a new standard."
"Have you ever dated anyone else? If the numbers are correct, it looks like you guys first hooked up when you were a teenager. Being in a relationship with someone like this isn't normal or healthy.

this would be enough for me to end the relationship"
"Then your boyfriend should stop seeing them so much. You 2 are a team. If he can't bring you to any kind of gathering they throw then he needs to not go as often if not at all. Talking to them won't get the message across. Him making himself scarce will. 

Whenever they invite him to something he needs to ask if you're invited. If they say no or change it at the last minute then he needs to decline their invitation. And to just be straightforward when the ask why. ""I don't like that my own girlfriend is constantly being left out by my own family. I love her and don't want her to feel left out. We are a package deal. If she can't come then I'm not going to either."""

"Send an email or some other written document detailing the cost of making that giant cake. For example the equipment you'll need to buy, the cost of icing, the oven you'll need to rent, etc. Send it to your aunt and say that as you don't have the necessary tools to make the wedding cake right now you're sure she'll be able to provide you with the money needed to get the tools for your gift."
"Because during the altercation OP didn't do anything while OP's family was berating the boyfriend.

Which is understandable from both angles, OP was panicked and now the boyfriend is the villain when a clearer response from OP during the moment probably would've not made that happen. He'll likely get over it."
"There could be so many reasons.

1. Its a major life event, and these can be overwhelming even if they are good! I cried when I first started college and I cried when I started my first job. I don't think our brains like a lot of sudden change, and the first time having sex is a lot of change!

2. How are your views on sex and sexuality? If you were raised in a sex negative household, you could be internalize a lot of guilt.

3. Do you feel insecure about your self or your ability to attract women? Becuase this woman is a ""10"" you might now feel a lot of pressure without realizing it to be able to attract more 10s. 

I would just reflect more on why you feel this way. Ultimately though, its ok and not abnormal to have this reaction.

Also, I REALLY want to point out that porn is NOT realistic, those women are not being pleasured in the way most women want. Also, watching something and doing something are very different. Be sure to communicate with any future woman you sleep with!"

"Your sister is an idealist.

You raise your daughter how you want, and your sister can raise her son how she wants."
Who the fuck is he to be upset about that and tell a 7 year old that her family isn't really her family instead of telling his adult wife his own feelings about it. That is a horrible thing to do. I would be livid. Especially at him brushing that off.

"From everything you describe about your relationship to Julie, your wife has played second fiddle to Julie at least emotionally.

You know, I wouldn't be surprised if your wife got your voicemail, rushed to hospital to be with you, saw Julie at your bedside and the two of you in deep, intimate conversation and turned around and left.

Your relationship with Julie is unhealthy and damaging your marriage and has probably already done so beyond repair, as your wife is not responding at all to you now.

Unless your wife is in another hospital or a morgue somewhere, you need to take a good, long look at your relationship with Julie and be very bloody honest with yourself, because what you have _is_ a relationship that is emotionally cheating on your wife.

ETA: You _have_ checked with friends that your wife is alright and not in another hospital or a morgue somewhere, right?"

"Wow, I'm not even married to this guy and I want to divorce him after reading that!  Nice one."
"Yes you do. Not mentioning a boyfriend isn't playing single. Not mentioning a boyfriend and flirting with another man to the point where you two kissed is most definitely ""playing single."" At this point you just seem really immature and selfish. Are you sure you're 24 and not 14? "

I would suggest setting up a trust if you desire to help. Set up a vehicle that acts like an annuity (yearly lifetime income) that has specific conditions and instructions.

"What this toddler is missing out on is (green) vegetables. So portions of frozen vegetable soup might be a better example than chicken. First you make a base stock out of some bones, meat, vegetable ends, then sieve it and cook vegetables in the stock to just done.

Problem is that for most children to try anything new, they need encouragement from an enthusiastic parent."
"&gt;At this point I just feel too invested. We have our group of friends--all in relationships and settled down. While I think about leaving David often, I know I won't. I don't want to have to explain to everyone why it didn't work. All of our friends look at us like we're this perfect couple and family...and it kills me a little inside because they know nothing of what happened. My parents are super traditional, and I don't want to have to explain to them why I'm raising 2 kids on my own. I also don't want to ruin that family environment for my kids. My oldest child thinks the world of both of us, and is always commenting about how much we love eachother. I don't want to rip that away from my kids and have them resent me. 

So your friends think you are the perfect couple and you don't want to let them down, your parents are traditional and you don't want to let them down, your kids think you are a perfect couple and you don't want to let them down, you say that David has changed ever since the challenging periods and you don't want to let them down. Where exactly are you coming in, in this picture? What about you and what you want? In not wanting to let everyone down, you are letting yourself down.

I can paint your future for you, if you like. You stay in this relationship for the sake of the image you have with your kids, for the sake of the traditional mindset of your parents and for the sake of keeping up appearances with your friends, while inwardly you suffer. You are doing everything to make everyone happy, but are not doing anything to make yourself happy. What will soon follow is resentment. You see, because you have given up doing what will make you happy to make.... pretty much everyone else happy, you will make it their job to make you happy. Now, you will make your friends to be responsible for your happiness, after all, you are staying to keep up appearances. You will make your parents to be responsible for your happiness, after all, you do not want to explain to them why you are alone. Worst of all, your kids will be responsible for your happiness, after all, you do not want to disappoint them. Because you have made this huge sacrifice that is making you unhappy (which by the way, no one has asked you to make) you will believe that the people who you have sacrificed something for are responsible for your happiness. 

Here is the thing, no one can make you happy. Only you can make you happy. The most people can do is give you momentary moments of pleasure and because you will never be satisfied when the source of your happiness comes from something other than yourself, you will never be satisfied with what people do. You will ask for more and more and more. After a while, it becomes a job that no one wants to have. 

Let us say that your friends cancel an appointment that you were looking forward to, this will frustrate you because you made a huge sacrifice for him/her and she should not just cancel an appointment. 
Let is say that your parents do not compliment you enough on your relationship, this will anger you because you are staying in an unhappy marriage so you do not disappoint them.
let us say that one of your child does something, let say it is small, like leave a toy on the ground. This will piss you off, I mean, after all, the reason why you are staying in an unhappy marriage is to keep the family together and they should appreciate that. You will see your anger and frustration at them as justified, when it is not.
You will feel entitled to things that you really are not entitled to. You will feel entitled to affection that you are really not entitled to and when it does not come, it will frustrate you. You have given up so much, so you are entitled to them going out of their way to make you happy. No, you are not entitled to it and no it is not their job to make you happy. It is your job to make you happy. This is why it is so important to do things that make you happy, so that you do not suffocate those around you or place impossible expectations onto them. 

In the end, the only person you will have to blame is yourself. The only reason you are unhappy is because you did not have the courage to chose your happiness. The only reason why you would carry so much resentment is because you had become so used to the resentment, that you sis not want to let it go."
"My best friend and roommate was brave enough to kiss me on a Halloween evening even though she was not entirely sure I would reciprocate (and she had never been with a girl before!) - fast forward: we are getting married next Friday.

"Honey this is so far beyond healthy. I had an abortion 10 years ago, although it was my choice at the time, so I understand it's not the same.

Now I am pregnant by my husband and over the moon. The fact that I am ecstatic to be having this baby right now does not mean for ONE second that I regret my abortion back then. At all. By the same token, just because he is having a baby now does not mean he regrets what he did or how he felt. You have to be able to see that.

You need to be able to move past this so you can have a healthy relationship with a man who wants a family as much as you do. It is tragic that you felt so pressured, because I believe it should be your choice, but I also don't think you would have been happy forcing a man to be a parent who didn't want to be one at the time. 

If you contact him, you won't get the response you want. He doesn't regret it. In fact, he's probably happier than ever because he gets to have this experience at a time in his life when he is ready. Im not condoning his behavior and attitude at the time, but it's time to move on, and you have to do it without him. You need new therapy because this recent development changes the situation and you're clearly not in a good place mentally or emotionally.

"Well, sure. But they did. So they need to use condoms. "
"The relationship is over. 

You made no attempts at reconciliation and had sex less than 12h after coming out of a four year relationship! 

You now want to impose a bunch of requirements, but really, it doesn't sound like your heart is in it. 

End it. 

For the record, ""I could probably do a lot better"" and sleeping with someone so quickly without even attempting to work things out doesn't make you look good. I get moving on, but the way you've treated her isn't great, so spare her any more drama and let her go."
"You've broken up with him 3 times for completely valid reasons. Do not marry him. **It is easier to break up with an immature jerk than to divorce an immature jerk**, and you have 3 major pieces of evidence here to tell you what direction this marriage will go.



I'd also like to point out that breaking up with someone who is overstepping your (clearly stated boundaries) is not manipulative. If you were using an empty threat of breaking up to get your way, that would be manipulative, and it's entirely possible you did that and didn't tell us here (we are only getting your side of the story, after all). However, if you really were breaking up with him to, as you've described here, get out of a relationship that wasn't working for you, then his changes of heart were his choice, and don't constitute manipulation on your part."
"Why didn't they pay you? Were you not there when they got home? Did they have some excuse for not paying you (no cash on them,  out of checks,  etc)? Usually,  I pay sitters as soon as I return home.  I think just reminding them they still need to pay you and tell them how much it is should work. Maybe they each think the other paid you or something.  That said,  don't sit for them again until you get paid.  They could be taking advantage of you. You will know,  because they will come up with an excuse to not pay you. "

"It seems like you don't think you were talking badly about them considering you said you ""rant[ed] to other friends."" Nothing about your intentions seems malicious. Venting is fine, but in my experience can be misconstrued easily when repeated. Living with friends, especially with different lifestyles, can be stressful and end up badly. You might tell them that you value their friendships but your lifestyle differences made you unsuitable to live together, and you turned to others to vent frustrations with no malicious intent. "
"Have you laid all this out for him? His mother is on one side saying, ""Oh, it's just a drink!"" You need to be on the other saying, ""It's not one drink, it's ten. It's every week. It's us having a very well laid out plan for controlling how much money you have in your pocket when you leave the house, because you drunkenly gamble it away. You've spent $x over the past 6 months alone. You've been drunk x number of times--[list them here, list his behaviors while drunk]. Can you honestly look me in the eyes right now and say none of that is a problem?"" 

He doesn't want to admit that this is anything other than good fun. There's a good chance he doesn't remember half of what he does while drunk to begin with. But you remember all of it and you know exactly how much it cost you (monetarily, in terms of time, in terms of your emotional state). Write down all that stuff and say it to him or give it to him. "

"I think your girlfriend is not reacting reasonably. She probably has a lot of complicated feelings about feeling left out by dancing, and she's taking it out on you.

But that doesn't help you resolve this. So here's my advice for what to actually do: talk about how you would like to handle situations like this *in the future*. That way you can stop arguing over who's wrong, and start talking about what would make both of you feel good. I would phrase it like this:

""I want to think about how to handle things like this in the future so we're both happy. If we're ever at a wedding or something and I want to dance and you don't, is there a compromise to be had? What can I do for you so I can dance some without making you feel abandoned?""

If her answer is ""nothing. Leaving me alone while you dance is never ok"", well, that's an unreasonable stance, and I don't think you should have to cater to it. Hopefully, though, presenting it in a future-oriented, problem-solving way will break the impasse you've gotten yourselves into."
"When I was a kid (like kindergarten/preschool) I would draw family pictures of me, my parents, and my little brother who is 18 months younger.  However, I'd always draw my mom as a pregnant person despite the fact that she never was.  I would tell my teacher that we were going to have a new baby, but not because my mom was pregnant, just because I really loved babies.  One day my teacher showed my mom all my art after school when she came to pick me up and my mom started sobbing.  Apparently she couldn't have any more kids after my brother because of labor complications and she was so sad and had wanted more children.  

I didn't know this at the time obviously, but when I was in college my mom told me.  Kids are just weird sometimes and don't know how their words impact people."
"I completely agree with this post.  If he was really committed to you, he never would have done this.

I recently caught my now ex-boyfriend asking out his ex.  We were in a down swing and were kinda unhappy.  We had just fought, and afterwards when he unlocked his phone, I saw that he had been talking to his ex.  So I snooped in his phone.  He not only asked her out, and told her that their relationship was the best he ever had.  When I confronted him, he was so angry he was screaming and kicked me out of his house.  We broke up because we can't trust each other anymore.  

My advice, have a friend over (and hiding somewhere) when you confront him.  I never imagined my ex would be that angry.  But looking back, he was only angry and blamed the mistrust on me because he got caught.  It was 100% his fault.  I also agree with the above about getting tested.  That's what I plan to do before I start dating again."
"1. Do not respond to your ex yet. 

2. Have you told his mother why you kicked him out? You want to get ahead of that before he can play for her sympathy or try to convince her that it's Not What It Looks Like. 

3. Call a therapist. Make an appointment as soon as you can.

4. Call a locksmith. In the heat of the moment you probably didn't take your key back from your ex, right? Get your locks changed.

5. Box up any stuff she's left. You can drop it back at her place if you don't want to meet her to give it back. You are not obligated to talk to her if you don't want to. Remember that ""closure"" is a myth and talking to her may well do you more harm than good.

You're going to get through this, but the fastest way through is going to be achieving No Contact as soon as feasible. The steps you take right now should be focused on evicting your ex from your life.

"Really OP should study the way his brother treats his wife's concerns -- SIL has an issue? Her husband is on the phone to OP trying to fix it. SIL wants to talk to OP about his wife? Her husband hooks it up.

I know you can't remove every trace necessarily - and not every place has the laws to protect you either, yet - but I have heard of at least some people having success.

"Invite your parents, but otherwise leave them out of everything.  Plan your own wedding with a smaller budget you can afford.  I'm sure your sister and friends would help in non-financial ways.

Example:  I couldn't contribute much to my daughter's wedding, but I helped set up, help make paper flower table ornaments, etc.  Daughter found an awesome dress for less than $500.00 but did have to do some looking.  She picked the colors and the bridesmaids could pick any dress they liked in that color, so all dresses were different, but they looked great.  She found a venue for $200.00 and a caterer that would cater a meal for a reasonable price and also made the cake (unconventional pancake wedding cake).  Friends did the music at no cost.  The wedding was fabulous.

Try to think outside the box with planning and have fun.  Remember that things will go wrong with the wedding, so just go with it and try not to stress.  Later, you will find that the goof ups made your wedding memorable.  I wish you and your fiance the best."
"If you're still reliant on them for money at all, or plan to move back in with them at the end of the school year, you might want to take what they have to say to heart. If they didn't like the fact that you disobeyed them, do you think they would no longer allow you to live with them? Do they pay for your cell phone right now? Help you pay for a car, if you have one?

I don't think you need to tell them absolutely *everything* you plan to do and ask for their permission. But I'm thinking it may be best to toe the line until you are fully independent, if for no other reason than to maintain the familial relationship.

My big sister was a lifesaver. She was with me from age 8-18. My mom died when I was young and my dad was too busy. I loved the 1:1 attention and getting out and doing normal stuff all my friends were doing with their moms! She even took me back to school shopping which was so great when all I ever got were hand me downs. Once I get a new job and settled I'll be a big sis!

"First off, a good life lesson is that doing this:

&gt;I put 110% into the relationship. I will give up all my time and/or money

will always lead to this:

&gt;I have been taken advantage of by almost all women I've been with

It has nothing to do with being around women or men. When you make yourself a doormat, nasty people will take advantage. And sadly when you're an insecure person, people tend to easily zoom in on that and use that to their advantage. 

Whether it's a job, a relationship or family, *giving your whole self blindingly* to something ultimately sets yourself up for hurt. You can be the lawyer who works 18 hours a day for 20 years only to wake up and realizes s/he has achieved nothing but a big empty house and nice car, or the  mother who lives obsessively for her children and breaks down when they move away and push her meddling ways out of their lives. 

&gt;I don't want to stop and I am incredibly tired of being the nice guy

Sorry, OP. You're not a nice guy. That was just the tale you weaved to explain why you've allowed yourself to be walked all over by people. 

If you want bad things to stop happening to you in your life, you need some counselling and to be single for some time. Learn to live for yourself and not whatever women wander into your life. "
"I think the solution here is that you need to find a way to address this internalized pity you have toward your GF and her kids, and the solution will arise from that. Renovating the house, which sounds like a wonderful compromise, has to be a family project, not a bone you throw. 

And for what it's worth, kids recover from moving. Their concept of home is not as rigid as adults. I have fond memories of some of my old houses but I definitely wasn't devastated by moving and I don't know how prominently your house situates in your children's dreams. That sounds like your dream.

Every now and then she throws in, ""but not you and (good medical school friend), of course!"" or ""don't be one of those doctors! I know you will try not to be!"". Which is just additionally insulting. What do I say when she inevitably comes back with, ""Oh, well I didn't mean you!""?"
"Guys. I get it.

The reason this person isn't liking our responses is because she didn't really ask the question she wanted to ask. what she really wants to ask is:

""I am ugly and lack the thick skin or good personality that would allow me to get past that and find love. I'm not open to any suggestions that I improve myself, and will take great offense to suggestions that i could have any negative attributes apart from my looks. I notice that hot women with terrible personalities and thin skin still get men just fine by relying on their looks and doing no personal introspection whatsoever. How can I also get men without working on my personality or getting $100k in plastic surgery? How do I get ""hot chick"" privilege?""

OP, you think people are being mean because those people are being BLUNT in the face of your stubbornness. They are being blunt because you have not shown that you are capable of acknowledging and internalizing their suggestions.

In life, looks can give you a free pass just like money. For the rest of us, you get out what you put in. You need to put in more work on yourself. The good news is that when you put in enough work, you find out that you can be happy without a relationship. THAT is the point that people tend to find the good relationships - when they aren't desperately pining for one to fix their lives. "
"One of my closest girlfriends dated her step brother. They were bonkers about each other. And it ended. Badly. 

The family has never been the same since, and they cannot be in the same room with each other. All events have to be separate. Everything REEKS of awkwardness and of course everyone took sides after the breakup, further dividing the family

While it's been years and things have gotten a bit better, both agree it was not worth it and if they could do it over again they would choose to not have been with the other. The family is forever fucked because of it.

"&gt;I don't even like pets, 

This came near the end of the post, but it seemed to me to be the single most important piece of information to process when deciding what to do next.

 If you're serious about that sentence ... well, your girlfriend is obviously not on the same page as you there. Look at what she's been doing with her time and life over the last few years! I understand your frustration in feeling like she went back on what you had agreed to, but I honestly think you had a basic compatibility issue before this latest disagreement; it would have reared its ugly head eventually no matter what. You not liking pets may seem like a minor thing to you, but for someone who *loves* them and has always had one in their lives, it could be a much bigger deal to them than you realize. It might be an incredibly important, comforting thing to have a dog in her life, and it's not necessarily something she's ever really sat down and self-analyzed on.

It's probably time for another serious talk with her -- first, because you're obviously feeling hurt and confused over her backpedaling on you, and that's perfectly valid. It's best to express those feelings in full and make sure she understands how much you were hanging your hat on this, and how surprising you found it that it seemed so easy for her to make a split-second decision to completely go back on your shared plans for your future without talking to you about it first. I have to agree with you there ... that was pretty messed up.

You also need that talk, though, to help her work through why she did it, and help you understand the same. It's obviously not as simple as ""oh, they just really needed my help."" Without pressuring her or making her feel guilty or upset -- she may just say what she thinks you want to hear to appease you, as well -- you need to get to the bottom of how important this is to her. Is it realistic for her to live happily without a pet, which has apparently been a huge part of her life up until now? If you can get her to admit that it's not an option (and probably even if she doesn't admit it, the truth is obvious) you'll likely have to make a value decision about what's more important to you:

A) Her as your significant other, co-habitating

... or ...

B) Your ability to continue to live pet-free (because you don't like them) in the place you're in now (which doesn't allow them). 

It doesn't sound like those two scenarios can co-exist in your life. You're either going to have to move, accept the status quo for the indefinite future, or break up. That's the big truth I gather from this."
"He's unbelievably immature. I'd expect a little kid with no filter to say your skin looks like ""chicken,"" not a 26-year-old man. 

None of his comments or insults are particularly constructive, either. They don't add to the relationship and they're not polite requests to change something that's upsetting him. They just exist for their own sake and only have the effect of being mean and rude. I had a friend like this (note: *had*) who would just unleash any negative thought that entered her head without consideration of others' feelings - from their clothing to hobbies to home decor to tastes in food. She didn't realize that it was insufferable behavior because, to her, she wasn't trying to be mean, just ""honest."" And she forgot about it 10 seconds later, anyway, as she wasn't all that invested in what she was saying. 

This is a hard personality trait to fix. By all means, talk to him. I hope he hears you out and reflects on his behavior, but I guess I'm a little pessimistic here about people who do this."
"I mean, you tell us several different things about whether or not you want to come over in this brief post:

&gt;But I don't really feel prepared and had plans to get choirs done and learn a little on some programs.

&gt;Had some things I wanted to get done today. Did you want me to?

&gt;If I knew you wanted me to, I wouldn't have taken a two hour walk just now. Have some choirs to take care of and personal things. I could try to make time, just didn't prepare to come today.

Those all sound to me like ""I'm too busy to come over"", but then you say ""I do want to come over though"" after she has told you ""no"".

Meanwhile, all she has done is ask you if you want to come over; when you said you're too busy, she decided she didn't want you to come over after all, and said so clearly. 

&gt;But she seems to be taking that personally as if I don't want to come over

Well, yeah. She asked you to come over, and you seemed to have other plans instead of saying, directly, ""yes, I want to come over"". Then suddenly when she doesn't want you to come over, you suddenly do though. What?

Also, you are REALLY reading into a lot of her minor activities on Facebook etc. 

I think you need to have more conversations with your girlfriend in person instead of going to Reddit for a contextless analysis of a very few of her words. "

"That's part of why he says he wants me to give up working at the bar. He says he doesn't think it's an appropriate job for a mother (which I don't get, I'm a bartender, not a stripper) and he thinks my hours will make childcare difficult. I've already agreed to taking maternity leave when we decide to have a kid, and probably cut down on night shifts until the kid is a bit older, too. "
"Nope, OP.  It would be one thing if you picked up the tab because you wanted to eat at a place out of their budget range, but their expectation is inappropriate.

"With all actions come consequences; your sister's are a clear demonstration of that.  But it's also true for you.  You have a choice to make, and that choice will have consequences.

If you choose to keep silent, you will have to deal with the consequence that you feel as if you are not living up to your internally-held standards.

If you choose to tell her what you think, you will have to deal with the consequence of...however she chooses to react to what you say, up to and including the possibility (as you say) that she might cut you out of her life.

So which is more important to you?  Having her in your life?  Or having had your say to salve your conscience?

Whichever one of those is more important to you, do the thing that leads to that.  Because you can't have it both ways.

All of that aside: I personally think you're trying to justify being a busybody by rationalizing it as some form of ethical requirement; she's an adult, she's making choices and suffering the consequences of them.  The fact that you disagree with her actions means that you are true to your own internal ethical guidelines.  You don't have to *tell* her anything about your disagreement in order to be true to yourself, unless your internal ethical guideline requires that you attempt to correct other people's behavior.

Is that the guy you want to be?"

Not true. GoT is hardly revolutionary. The X-Files, Buffy, The West Wing, Dexter, The Wire, Terminator, Battlestar Galactica, Alias - all of these shows had multi-dimensional female characters. Even Peggy Olsen in Mad Men was a bad ass."
"Yeah, that makes sense. I guess I probably should have talked to him already, I was just reluctant in case he felt like he had to perform for my parents (either as more ""masculine"" or more ""feminine). As per a lot of the other comments here, I'll make sure that when I talk to him about this he knows I've got his back if he's pissed off. Thanks for talking some sense into me, heh."
"That's definitely a positive spin on it, but my concern would be- how would he have treated you if the roles were reversed? Is he being nicer to you because now he's relieved that his son's ""really a man"" because he's on top? Would he have been shaming and ashamed if you were, in his mind, ""the woman""? Because that would REALLY bother me and I wouldn't want to accept any of the perks that come at the expense of women (and, by extension, your boyfriend)."
"I guess the part that stands out to me the most is that she already explained to him that she didn't like the unwarranted comments on her body. He did it again, and about the same body area no less.

She couldn't have been more clear, I don't see how he could have just done it again."
"&gt;My first marriage

But your husband's second marriage, and it's your husband's family that's not sending you cards.

&gt;we didn't live together before the wedding.

You've said it yourself: both of you are adults with good careers and plenty of stuff, hence why they likely didn't see the need to support you as if you were a young couple.

E: I guess I don't see the need for a card saying literally ""congratulations on getting married"" when the people who came to your wedding said congratulations in person. Cards are traditionally given with gifts, and considering that this was your husband's second wedding *and* both of you ""have no need for gifts"", I'm not particularly surprised you didn't get cards."
"&gt; when you uninvited them from your wedding?

She mentions above that these are people who did come to the wedding.  None of them brought a card."
"It sounds like every time David said something, YOU'RE the only that's been taking it to inappropriate levels. You're the only asking about what he means by ""chances"", YOU'RE the one asking David about his interest/playing along. The more positive your reactions are, the more willing David will be to start to cross the line. And you're letting him and you're crossing the line too. 

I can't believe you said that your husband is frustrating sometimes to David. It sounds like you like the attention from David and you're developing feelings for him. This is how emotional affairs start. If you don't want to have an affair, as you claim you don't, then you need to tell your husband everything and stop hanging with David, now. "
"Why are you affecting this intense obtuseness and condescension? 

You know what OP is implying, and just because you're *like, omg, the coolest and most progressive girl ever,* doesn't mean that you're the authority on what's appropriate in a situation when (1) a friend's mother accosts OP at OP's own engagement party to say the bride-to-be is ruining her daughter's chances of getting married to OP's fiance, (2) that friend never hangs out in OP's presence, (3) that friend only hangs out on overnights with OP's fiance, alone with male friends.

You're not the only woman who has guyfriends. You're not more evolved than other women. Your trolling is boring and obvious. Stop."
"You can still put him in time out in public. Any corner/seat/wall can become a time out corner/seat/wall. 

My mom always increased the length of our timeouts by age -- so at 6 years old, your son should have a 6 minute time out. If he gets up, add another minute to the clock."
"&gt;I couldn’t find Rita, but several dancers went up to me for a dance/tips. Some were very leading and trying to get me to go back for something private.

Yeah, that's how strippers and strip clubs make money.  Private dances at $30-40/song.  That doesn't make her a prostitute.  "
"All they have to do is call the cops and say he's having a some kind of mental break and is threatening suicide, which is true. I would say suicide instead of homicide, so the police will be less trigger finger-y. Police will hopefully come, see that he's unhinged and put him on an emergency hold so he can be evaluated by a professional. I've had to do this before and it worked to at least get a three-day hold, though my friend managed to bullshit the psychologist and was released after that to wreak more havoc. His girlfriend should take the opportunity to move out in safety and not count on them holding him very long in case he manages to do the same. "
"Your SO doesn't owe *anyone* for being with you, much less ex-lovers. "
"Youngest of 3 (4 if you count my brothers best friend who lived in my house for 6 years), we never had to rebel like this because our parents weren't shitty but in l public or anything kind of situation that required it we stood up for each other.

When I was 12 and my brother was 16 I found a box of cigars, I hid them from both him and my parents until I asked him wtf he was doing with them and tried to get him to stop. Oldest bro backed me up... eventually 7 years later my mom found the hidden cigars (I forgot where I put them) and told this story to her, she was surprisingly proud"
"Lets put it this way. I have friends who make TERRIBLE romantic decisions. They argue with their gfs over nothing, they are jealous, they fall too fast too hard and are too stubborn to leave a bad relationship, etc etc. 

They're lovely friends though, because I can walk away from them when they're annoying me, and I get time away from them, and I'm not forced to deal with those aspects of their personality. But I would NEVER date them, because I've seen how they act in a romantic sphere."
"Are you very sure she doesn't just hand him is portion back? I mean, your mother is so very concerned about giving him money..."
Bwahahhahah. $300 ?!? Try $1500 for a full head of extensions :)
"It's not, in my experience. They don't want kids, they don't like kids, they give rude annoying kids nasty names... but they don't want them to suffer, and they definitely don't want to hurt them. That just makes them noisier, and may cause them to produce more mucous."
"Would you want to know? You can't tell her anonymously; that won't work out well, and she deserves the truth from someone she trusts since her husband clearly can't be counted on. I understand why your husband would prefer to stay out of it, but TIM brought him into it when he chose to cheat in front of everyone. And frankly, I'd be more than a little concerned that your husband is condoning this infidelity. And that his best friend is the kind of guy who cheats on his wife with strippers. "
"Is your husband named Raymond and does everybody love him? 

But all jokes aside, I'd set boundaries with your mother in law. I'd find a new babysitter. I would schedule services before she has the chance to and before you even tell her. Hell, I might not tell your husband until after the fact. 

I'd also get into individual, couples, and group therapy ASAP to learn how to set healthy boundaries between the three of you. "
"&gt; Most women my age range are married, have kids, or have different types of baggage.

dude, you are 29. If you live in any kind of city, that just plain isn't true. "
"""but besides all this our relationship is really great"", right? (Not my first r/relationships rodeo)"
"I'm having a hard time understanding why your girlfriend of only 1 year lives with you, doesn't contribute anything financially, doesn't have a job and is completely financially supported by you.  How did this situation come about? To me, that's not normal.  I would never offer to completely financially support my boyfriend (not that I can) and we've been together for two years, and wouldn't expect him to do it for me, and wouldn't want him to for that matter.  She isn't your wife or fiancé, and you haven't been dating long enough for that to be appropriate.  That to me is a HUGE red flag, she's 27, why doesn't she have a job and a place of her own? I know that's not what you're asking about specifically, but I just think it's so important to point out.  It brings up a lot of questions up about someone's character, work ethic and ultimate long term goals for me when I hear they're completely living off of a boyfriend they've been dating for only one year. 


Anyway, your girlfriend sounds awful from your description.  I know it's hard to get a full picture of someone from one short post, so I usually try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but the way she treats you is gross. I have never suggested that any boyfriends of mine change their hair or clothes or tan more.  If that many things about someone really bothered me, I wouldn't be with them in the first place. Honestly, from the picture you've presented your girlfriend sounds like an entitled, spoiled, drama queen and you sound like a total pushover who allows his girlfriend to criticize him constantly, put him down, but also live off his money and do absolutely nothing to contribute. This may not be the actual case, but that's the picture you've drawn here in this post. 




SO.....if it were me, I would kick her to the curb, or at least kick her out of your house and stop supporting her, and then think about why you would be okay being with someone who seems to have so little respect for you, but has no problem taking advantage of and using you."
"If I have the money to go on a fancy trip to Europe because I don't like the more adventurous style (AirBnB, backpacking, economic class in a transatlantic flight which can be really uncomfortable, etc), I would be pretty annoyed if my bf makes me go cheaper just because of pride.

Your girlfriend wants a more expensive trip and she will pay for what she wants. This is not to make you feel less or to make you look like a gold digger. Is like if my SO can only afford a McDonald but I want to go to an italian restaurant. I don't want McDonald, I hate the taste and is a bit gross for me. Will you make me go to McDonalds because is what you can afford, when I can perfectly pay for both of us in a nice italian restaurant?

Your GF wants a kind of trip that she can afford and she gave you best compromise in this situation: pay for what you can, she will cover the rest. She's not using you, you're not using her. But making her go through a trip that she doesn't want when she gave you a good compromise is selfish.

Like someone else said, what you can do is reduce her load of the planning. Take everything in your hands so she only needs to put her share of the money before jumping in the plane."
So she wants to force you into the most important decision you will ever make by having a temper tantrum? Run. It's actually completely legitimate for a woman to decide to break up and move on if she wants to have kids and her partner doesn't. The way she is doing it though is 100% wrong. Nagging and crying about is not the way to go in a mature relationship. I suspect there's a lot more problems in this relationship than you're writing about.
"But this is *your* friend, not *his* friend.

I feel like as long as he still respects her, it really isn't to important to hang out with them. He's met her at least once, right, so that's really it.

Your bf is not you, and you are not him. You both do not need to lead identical lives with the same peers. He respects your friend, and respects you spending time with her because she's *your* friend? Good on him."
You don't want to wind up being the guy that your friends like but gradually stop inviting out because you're the one with the girlfriend that likes to stir stuff up and throws a fit when she doesn't get her way.
"Yeah, I basically choked on thin air when I read that. I don't think I've spent $300 on make up my entire life. And I'm not talking about in one sitting; I'm saying cumulatively."
"You don't have to hav any contact with hin AND you don't need to give a reason other than ""he was severely abusive and is still toxic so I don't want him in my life."" If people press you for a reason, tell them you don't want to talk about it - remember that you don't owe anyone an explanation.

I'm curious as to why you don't want the truth to come out. Whom are you protecting?

For more help and support, you may want to check out /r/raisedbynarcissists. That sub is for people with toxic family members who may or may not have a diagnosed personality disorder. You'll be very welcome there."
You're applying your sexuality to OP. Your sexuality is not universal.
"Dude.....Bellarke isn't even a characters name, it's the ""shipping"" name of Bellamy and Clarke, two characters on the 100....basically you named your daughter ""Kimye"" or ""Brangelina"" and Jesus Christ that is insane. I'm sorry. Also it's hilarious, but probably less so for you."
You know you've hit rock bottom when you are in a springer situation 
"You owed her an apology, a better one than you gave. You took it upon yourself to rewrite her draft and then you pulled out last minute. You went above what was asked, set a new expectation, then backed out last minute. That was kind of rude. 

Additionally, you are in no place to suggest she wait a semester to apply. Don't offer advice on a situation you aren't privy to."
I'm much more grossed out by this story than is maybe rational. Maybe you shouldn't have sex with your brother's childhood friends.
"I did ask about a DNA test on the second child during a fit of rage yesterday.. but everyone on my side of the family thought I was wrong because they say she is ""the spitting image of me"". 

Who fucking knows these days.. but then the other question would be, do I wan't the kids to grow up knowing they are only half siblings?

I guess in this world you gotta look out for yourself, which is fucking depressing. This is the kind of experience that makes me just wan't to leave it all and explore the world/start a new life. 

Nothing hurts more than this, and trust me I have had several injuries. FUCK. "
"""By this evening she told me that she didn't know what she would do without me""

"I feel both sad and angry that she is so sexist. I am going to fight my brother for the non existent inheritance. I am not a man but I still work full time and have a mortgage. I have no kid by choice.

I am going to reduce her allowance. "
"It's even worse. In another comment he said,

&gt; I actually lost my job within the first week I met her. I even asked her if I can move in and I can pay her back for rent money once I get a job. She was cool with it

What kind of a single mom thinks it's a good idea to let some unemployed guy she met that same week move in? Someone completely lacking common sense.

"
But that doesn't explain why no one even sent a congratulatory card.
"I loled a bit reading that he's Slovak. Definitely a bit more traditionalism and gender roles going on there than in the US. But anyway, I think the problem here isn't his comments intitially, it's that you were pretty clear in communicating what your issues with what he said were and he blew you off. Try and look away from the body stuff, away from your body image feelings and all that, but just focus on the very simple exchange of you saying ""please don't do this, it's uncomfortable for me"" and him ignoring. That's really what's telling here."
I can get grumpy as hell when I'm hungry but it doesn't lead me to berate and belittle my girlfriend. 
Did ya miss the part about him drawing very specific markings on her body that he wouldn't otherwise be able to see without having seen her naked? That's pretty fucking creepy to me.
"You didn't reduce paying her a monthly allowance. Oh sure, you reduced the amount of actual cash your giving her, but you replaced that actual cash with a health insurance payment which depending on the plan can but up to $900. I don't get it. Instead of giving your mother any money why not save it or invest it yourself and give yourself a nice retirement or your kids a nice cushion. Or if you're down to hand out free money, I have bills that need paying and I could use a monthly allowance. "
"So, he got custody of a baby human being, without talking to you about it, &amp; now he'd like you to quit your job to help raise said baby? But you'll pretend to be a family that made a loving choice to bring the baby into your lives, so it'll all work out okay in the end? People get mad at their spouses for bringing a large screen television or a motorcycle into their lived without consulting the other partner, &amp; those aren't decisions that require the other partner to change the course of the rest of her life."
"With all due respect, I know how abuse starts. I really don't think that is the case here. I'm not going to just totally block out the idea of it, but I also know husband. We've lived together for years. He comes from a good, stable family. He has lifelong friendships with people who respect him. I've met old girlfriends of his that he is still on good terms with and were very clearly not abused.

I get it, I do. It's always who you least expect. It's always the totally sweet and understanding guy who was totally sweet and understanding until he wasn't. But I also know my husband. I don't necessarily think he is gearing up to rear his ugly head. "
"Just wanted to chime in to mention that I was a complete basket-case the first few months of my son's life, maybe even the whole first year. Everything that bothered me and made me cry that year I can now mostly attribute to the hormonal roller coaster I was on, postpartum.

It's not a fix for this situation, but perhaps it will help you to view these sorts of things in context: it may well just be the hormones driving her crazy, and this fight won't be remembered a short time in the future.

But, fair or not, no one likes having their feelings minimized, even if the reasoning is something valid like postpartum hormones, so this is something that's probably better just kept in your head and not said to her, since it's likely to feel antagonistic to her rather than rational. I know, that's hardly fair, but all the hormones surrounding pregnancy and breastfeeding and all the rest of it don't play fair either."
"I can't believe I have to type this for a 2nd time today. Fucking fuck.

OP, don't date children. "
"Seriously, putting almonds in everything at dinner requires some effort and deliberately ordering the chef to ignore good taste. It's not an oversight, it's absolutely deliberate. Why can't you see that? Almond mashed potatoes? Mashed almond potatoes makes sense. Almond mashed potatoes on top of almond sauce on everything *and* almond bread... Unless your family grows almonds, that's a very obvious slight."
I think what you did was sweet. You gave him the space he seemed to be needing and your gesture showed that you care about him. Now- hold off on texting him again to see if he got it. Otherwise the action will be perceived as not giving him space.  
"Your girlfriend is nuts. 

In the extreme off chance that you end up living in Paris, I guarantee she's going to be disappointed. Paris is a grimy big city like any other and not too different from whatever city you're in now.

This is pretty vicious. You have a moral responsibility to tell Rochelle (ideally anonymously... I think finding out that some woman found it googling her name is just insult to injury). The fact that Sherry does not feel empathy for Rochelle is a serious problem.
Ha! That would just be the fucking peak.
A death record is a public record. Request it from the county coroner if you want to go that route but IMo he should be dead to you regardless.
"If she only has one child, then anyone who knows the family will know who the pseudonym is referring to.  Additionally, even if a book isn't widely sold, people who know her will be likely to buy it in order to support her. I really don't think a pseudonym for her daughter's name will help."
"Seriously! I read the whole thing in a French accent in my head and made myself swoon. 

Stay strong, OP. You can, and will, do so much better!"
This is an easy one: You dump her cheating ass and refuse to sign the birth certificate until a paternity test has been done.
"It's really concerning that he doesn't seem to respect you enough to make an effort to be quieter. I mean, how hard can that be?

Can you imagine spending the rest of your life with someone who respects your needs so little?"
"He thinks if we push our son harder he can make a career out of it. Our son is very good, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with him playing at the high school lever and beyond with all the injuries. "
"&gt; After that she told me that she just wanted to let me know that she's sorry as well and hung up on me.

Well I suppose there are two scenarios:

1. Your MIL just assumes your wife cheated and therefore apologized. In this case your wife may have cheated or it's possible she was assaulted. Based on your wife's post-birth reaction though it is reasonable to assume *something* untoward has happened.

2. Your MIL has talked to your wife and *knows* she cheated and therefore apologized.

Either way make sure your name does **NOT** go on that birth certificate. If it is there already you can get it removed but generally it requires a court order to do so. Even if your name is *not* on the birth certificate you may still be automatically assumed by the state to be the father as you are married to her. You can get this fixed too, but again through the courts. There is a time limit to do this but it's typically ~2 years (varies by state though!) Edit: And if you have been behaving as the father of the child post-birth (which you haven't until now) you may have a much harder time getting yourself declared as not the father. 

In short: **You need a lawyer.** Find a good one and learn what you need to do in your state. Don't mess around with this, screwing it up could result in 18 years of child support for a kid that's not yours."
"yeah, seriously, I commented with some similar advice, but looking back at my friend's trajectory (semisuccessful!) I still wouldn't want her life experiences.  Modeling can really suck.  You're an objectified commodity, age and weight are constantly being held against you, people are making passes at you and talking down to you all the time, and when you get out, your work experience is shit.  Yes, you get to travel but you rarely get to actually SEE the cities you're in.  My friend had been to Paris about 10 times but had really only seen the inside of her hotel (which - share a room with 4-6 other models, you're always sharing space with your agency's other models), cabs, backstage and runways until she took herself for a pleasure trip, in her 30s.  "
Undergrad and post doc aren't remotely similar positions.
More red flags than a bullfighting convention.
"Tell her it stands for Fuck my Annoying Grandma.

All kidding asides the situation might be becoming to much for you to handle, she might need a nurse and maybe a home. If not maybe you can send her to your aunts for a few days, just to relaxe a bit."
"I was thinking of posting on my own, and started to type it, then it got too long, so I deleted it.  I have a lot of mixed emotions right now, but am feeling sort of good about it.  It's stressful, yet almost exciting in like we're moving forward.  I know that makes no sense.  I was getting very worked up while debating with my mother, but I was also smiling because the things coming out of her mouth were just so absurd.  This sub is so supportive, and really helped me prepare for when this day came.  

My husband ended up calling my dad to tell him that we don't want *them* to leave; we want my brother gone, and we'll give him reasonable time (90 days).  My dad asked my husband to let him handle it, but then said, ""she's been my wife for 50 years, and that's her boy, so if she wants to move, we're moving.""  I asked my husband, ""what about her girl?  I guess her daughter who financially supports her doesn't matter in all of this?""  My husband told my dad, ""if that's what you've gotta do, then do it, but it'd be a shame that your grandkids will only see you every few months if that happens.""

After discussing options, as in if they do move, I'm now actually sort of hoping it happens.  I  don't think I'd make them, but the thing is, we have a lot of debt from starting a business.  We used to live in their house, and it's much smaller than ours.  We have a lot of equity in our house, so my thought is that we sell our own home, and move back into the house they live in, we'd have much more financial freedom, and could have some breathing room.  

On top of that, my dad is in poor health, and there's no way he'll be able to maintain a two story old craftsman with a big yard for much longer.  I'd be willing to continue our arrangement, and get them into a townhouse or apartment.  It'd be a win-win.  Dad would relax, brother would be gone, and my mom could just deal with it.  If they don't agree, we'd just shift the money we pay them to the daycare we've been using part time since the kids were toddlers.  The youngest is starting school this year, and while I completely value having my parents there to help with the kids since birth, I think now may be a good time to evolve.  I'm feeling positive, but the road ahead is a challenging one.   

"
"This.  As the son of an alcoholic father (who died way too early because of it), I can 100% relate how you are treating your husband to how my mom treated my dad.  Broken record, always a reason to let it go ""just this once"", etc.  

My brother is going down the exact same road.  My mom always helps him.  Money troubles, she bails him out.  In jail again?  Here comes mom.  I tell her she's enabling and she doesn't listen.  

It's hard to put your foot down.  but sometimes you have to for the sake of the other person.  And honestly, for yourself as well."
"fuck, here's some tough love for you:

you're needy and as long as you won't respect yourself no one else will. and sure as hell not your cheater boyfriend that totally fucked that other girl in the night (or at least made out with her).

you totally just proved him that he can just have you stick around until he finds the next stunning girl he falls heads over heels with that lives closer to him - and then break up with you. or well, he won't even break up with you because quite frankly, why should he? he can treat you like he wants. he can have his cake and eat it, too!

if he ""can't do anything"" with her he sure as hell will find another woman. just wait. i mean, he's totally 110% loyal and is oooh so in love with you, that's why he's fucking another woman.

i mean, don't you get it yourself how ridiculous it is that the only thing keeping him from cheating is that she lives in another country?"
"*Semi permanent?*

That shit is there for life. Full black and grey, the only way that could be removed is by removing some of the pigment and tattooing *over* it, but darker tattoos are impossible to cover fully. "
My flatmate's two year old is refusing to say hi to me when I come into the room at the moment. Though I asked her if we were still friends and she said yes lol I guess it's just two year old weirdness.
"I sort of doubt that, he seems like the type of asshole who would get pissy at OP for even hinting at it to make a point, because how could he possibly not be enough for her?"
"I noticed the disconnect too. Throwing them in a dumpster/setting them on fire suits the situation much better. I think regardless of what he actually did with the toys, he's saying this so when the fallout comes he can say ""I was doing CHARITY I was trying to be NICE"". 

But yeah, this is a movie serial killer origin level story."
Maybe she's just plain mean then?
"On top of that OP could invest the money instead, meaning she's losing out on even more money."
I'd approach the chat from a angle that you're concerned about his health and want to make sure you have a very long happy healthy life together. 
"Man, these troll posts on here are getting good.

&gt;saw that we had well over twenty grand extra, and sold my old Prelude to the appraiser for nineteen thousand dollars. She then took that money, plus the twenty-four grand and immediately bought a 2017 BMW i3 outright for cash.

$19,000 for an 81 Prelude? I've seen survivors in mint condition with under 50,000 miles go for under $10,000 after a *bidding war*.

Also, your wife couldn't have sold the car without your signature. Even if you both were on it together, you still would have to sign off as co-owner.

And she moved a five figure sum out of your account without you noticing it?

Yeah, I'm calling bullshit on this whole thing. It's a great story OP, but it doesn't add up without some serious illegal shit going on."
"&gt; Him saying that he can't wait for her to die is fucking awful

Yeah, this is what makes me question if his household would really be positive and loving for the children."

"Hey, I don't want to start a food fight but ice cream, cookies, milk by the  multiple gallons and fresh fruit are not what poor people stock up on if there grocery budget is *that* tight.

"Also his mother admitted they were ""more harsh"" with Cat. Considering belting their children is apparently completely normal, even ""more harsh"" than only one of the other siblings could *easily* make no contact more than justified. She doesn't have to be okay with being beaten just because her siblings are."
"FWIW I don't think either of you are in the wrong, it's just different backgrounds and expectations.  Hopefully the income disparity won't be too big of a hurdle for you.  I'm in a similar situation to your gf, and it has definitely made relationships...not the easiest."
"This. Your brother did you wrong, but it's been a long time and you've moved on to a happy marriage since. You would not have been happy with your ex-fiancee, because she was a terrible person. Infidelity takes two to tango, and you've probably been putting all the blame on your brother, because he's still around. You could cut her out of your life and did, but I bet you aren't still burning with anger long after against her, but you were against your brother. You can't completely remove him from your life, because he's still around the rest of your family. So you've tended the flower of your anger, letting it take root and grow, pruning it and watering it so it will last. You've maintained it to remind yourself how much you loved and admired your brother and how badly he betrayed you, but it doesn't have the same sting anymore, does it?

Have you been holding onto your anger and grudge against him out of principle? That he did the wrong thing and should be punished? Well, you've punished him, and you said yourself, you're not that angry with him anymore. It's been a long time and I think he's honestly had time to reflect on this and knows how much he hurt you, and now he's facing his own mortality and he wants to make things right with you. He literally broke down and came to you on his knees, crying and begging forgiveness. One can't really beg any more, at that point. He's at his lowest, he knows he was wrong, he's truly sorry, and he's going to die. That last point can pretty much guarantee you his sincerity; there's no point for him to try to deflect responsibility or not admit how shitty he acted, because there is literally nothing left for him to salvage or defend there. "
"100% call the police if he talks about killing himself. If he's serious, he needs help - and if he's not, there need to be consequences to his manipulative behavior. Telling his parents would also ensure he doesn't get to run crying to mommy and daddy and say how mean you are if he's faking it. (If he's serious that would make them a support system for when he needs it).

I've been in a similar situation before, so I get feeling responsible for his life should he threaten to take it. But in the end he's the only one responsible for himself, and him holding this over your head as a tool to get what he wants is fucked up. Don't fall for it, OP."
"I get that forgiveness is not easy either, but once you get in the habit then it is less of a struggle. I always tell myself to forgive because the other person is in a lot of pain/turmoil/damaged and I am not responsible for their behavior."
"First, I agree with everyone here.   It's almost the same as having his name tattooed on your shoulder or something; a constant reminder of him competing with your love for a ghost.   I also agree with you that those comments were too far; he is speaking from his hurt/indignation of what you are asking. Find a different way to honor him. "
"And what did they say to the ""i don't see why it would be awkward?"""
Your grandmother might also have to divorce your grandfather because she needs those financial resources. Someone needs power of attorney. Perhaps the first step is a doctor visit to see if she can be declared incompetent.
There was a post a while back with a guy who had a similar Knight in shining armour complex. The OP in that post had a candle from her late sister and the boyfriend destroyed it because he wanted her to go back to being miserable and depressed the way she was after her sister died- apparently he got off on that. Incredibly fucked up shit.
"Soooo, as long as the two of you objectify women together in language you approve of you're ok with it....

Because make no mistake, what you are doing with your husband _is_ objectifying women: reducing them to their looks and what they do for you sexually."
"This exact same scenario happened to my dad(minus the paternity thing) and he took my mom back. They lived in separate rooms in the same house and she continued to cheat on him off and on.

Don't do it, just don't."
No good deed goes unpunished unfortunately. The good news is you have exposed a major character issue in your gf and her friend group. What you do now is up to how high your tolerance for unreasonable bullshit is. 
"Now you know what kind of person your cousin is. I'm sorry for your loss. We had a very similar string of events happen. The bride was gracious and just a beautiful person, and thanked the family for even remembering her during this tragic loss. I love her more and  want her and her new husband to be more in our lives. "
"God I would be fucking furious. Unless you are a car junkie and know exactly what the other person wants, you just don't buy people surprise cars, especially if you have no idea what you are doing. If someone sold my more or less 2.5k$ worth banged up E39 and gave me that, I'd be pissed. Because you just don't sell other people's property and you don't use their money to surprise them (and you don't touch a car junkie's car, ever). 

Plus I personally would be embarassed to even drive that thing around, it just looks like crap (plus is possibly absolutely useless depending on where you live). Talk to your wife, calmly. Don't be accusatory no matter how pissed you are and tell her that it bothers you and all the reasons why, see she has to say for that. "
"But she didn't reject Patrick. She was ""in love"" with him but he acted indifferent towards her even though later on he admitted to apparently ""secretly loving"" her back. "
"Seriously, it's time to back up Amy and bow out of this shit show of a wedding. Your uncle lied to bum money off of people for it, she is treating you and Amy less than servants and more like slaves, and you are pregnant. I don't have to have my medical degree yet to tell you that stress is NOT good for momma and developing baby. She got 100 bucks and your time and stress, she has gotten enough. Bow out of the wedding and let that shit fizzle out on its own. She does not care about you or Amy to respect your weddings, saying that there would finally be a ""real wedding"" in the family? Are you fucking kidding me? And the thing with your ring is shady as fuck. "
"Ugh, im betting a lot of this will clarify once you meet his parents... And im willing to bet a LOT that it will be a tense, prim and ""proper"" visit. Youd better keep your elbows off the table and dont mention anything remotely biological or someone might faint sort of deal...

And he'll be sitting there beaming that his parents are the ""right sort"" of people and ""classy"" and stuff while you want to take your own life with a salad fork. "
Yes! I 26F (fit) had a former colleague 28M (ripped) who was sexually harassed by many people including his direct manager. I was so happy for him when he left he company because I know the disgusting things people would say to him because he was in phenomenal shape and decent looking. The double standard made/makes me sick. 
"She does have a reason. She doesn't find the relationship exciting anymore. And though that may not make sense to you **it does happen to people have been together for so long**. This is usually when they decide to spice things up or go back to the beginning and have scheduled dates to reaffirm those old feelings or just let the relationship die until you eventually break up. 

So you can either just dismiss your GF's feelings (because they don't make sense to you) until she breaks up with you (or you break up with her like she's hinting at) or you can work on your relationship and try to get back that spark you once had. However, if you don't feel like it's worth it then honestly, your relationship is doomed."
"&gt; I honestly thought people would be on my side. I thought they'd give me pointers on how to contact my ex and how best to express my emotions. I never expected everybody to be on his side.

These aren't sides. You asked if you should (again) contact your ex and try to convince him (again) that your decision a decade ago was a mistake, because reasons. People are saying no. This isn't a side, this is a rational position because its not going to change anything for the better regardless of what he thinks. If you aren't seeing that, how this accomplishes nothing, your problem is out of the Internet's paygrade. Seek a professional."
"You're doing an awesome job but babies are hard on the emotions no matter what you do. 

I had the same problem with my husband. When the baby wakes, or fusses during the day, I immediately tend to him. I don't get dressed even though I will be cold. Whether I need to go to the bathroom or not doesn't even register. I don't usually have breakfast until lunchtime and the baby is asleep. Something in my biology just suppresses all my own needs until the baby is settled. 

When my husband would go to the bathroom and get dressed before picking our son up it would drive me crazy and make it really hard for me to go back to sleep anyway.

Also when he is watching our son, he can still get his work/hobbies done while my attention is never truly off the baby unless I've left the house. Even in the evening when he's asleep, I'm listening for cries more than whatever else I'm trying to do. 

It's maddening but it's not his fault, nor is it yours. Your wife will see reason in a few months when she's getting more sleep and there's more time between feeds. You probably won't get through to her now. 

What she's really feeling is that she is never 'switched off' which is like being at work 24/7.  She needs to leave the house (alternatively have you and the baby leave the house) to truly have a break. 

Just don't take it personally, you really are doing a great job."
"He took out a credit loan for a vacation that was then canceled because of the split. He hasn't said who ended up spending the money meant for the vacation. Can presume it was him. 

They equally paid off the car and mortgage and he still didn't give her half the sale price of the car (which he reallt should have). She doesn't owe him anything. "
"What other gender stereotypes are  letting yourself in for?

does he ASSUME you will have kids and be a SAHM, for example?  Cleaning and cooking 100%? Long sulks if you earn more than him?  "
"I think you should tell her that if she portrays your childhood in the book in a way that is dishonest you will go to a lawyer and make sure the book gets shut down and that she pays for the damage it would do you to emotionally and to your reputation.  And that if she publishes the book under her real name *at all* you are going to be absolutely mortified to have your painful and private childhood put out in print that it's going to spoil the small amount of relationship you have.  You are barely able to tolerate having her in your kids' life as it is, you are barely able to handle your resentment towards her even now.  

"
It sounds like part of the problem is your mother's alcoholism. How do you get home after looking after grandma? Do you know how to drive? Does your mother take the only car to work -- is that why you can't help grandma on weekday evenings instead?
That's the thing.. I'm not that person. I'm normally very outspoken and would assume squash someone who was rude or offensive with me than waste my time. Idk how it got like this...

"I don't really have any advice, I just want to say how sorry I am this is happening to you. Sometimes I hate this sub because reading posts like yours make me feel like I've been kicked in the gut. I can't imagine how you feel. I guess try to move as quickly as you can so you can move on with your life."
I'm glad I'm not the only one whose focus was pulled to these statements.
"When the banks won't give someone money, there's a damned good reason, and choosing to step in instead practically guarantees a loss.  "
I was trying to phrase it so she didn't have to lie.
"Right, okay...

So why are you with him?"
"I think when you're ready you should talk to someone. There seems to be a lot of emotions and issues that have led you to feel this attached and jealous over a man who is NOT your father spending time with his actual daughter, who you've never met but somehow know all these negative things about.  you're not a child, you're an adult. He's not here to be your father figure. He is really here to love your mother. I know you've wanted a stable father figure, but you have taken it to an unhealthy extreme and you need to work through that."

"Yeah, in normal circumstances a partner demanding to look through your phone is a massive red flag. But when you've previously had an admitted emotional affair and you have just been found out as having lied about ""working late"" (which is about as classic an excuse for absence-while-cheating as it gets, even without the rest of it) AND that this has meant your wife has been providing free childcare that you were meant to help with to your sister for A MONTH and your explanation is ""I was hanging out with my friend/just doing whatever""? Those are not really normal circumstances, IMO."
"People who make it as a model do not ever have to pay for the privilege. If anyone wants money from you to model, they're scamming you. The course is a scam, your parents are right and quite frankly you seem incredibly naïve. If anything, this course sounds like a front to get vulnerable girls into the sex trade. 

Do not go to Prague you'll be trafficked into sex slavery. 

Edit: literally every comment says it's an obvious scam and you're all over this thread commenting how everyone's wrong. Really? "
"As a vegan myself, fuck this girl! She had no right to go into your grandparent's home, eat their food(after they accommodated her), and insult them like that! I thought your response of cutting her out of the bridal party but letting her maybe redeem herself was reasonable, but after learning that you were conceived by rape, I think you should just cut her out of the wedding entirely. Your grandparents do not need a childish brat to keep them from attending their granddaughters' wedding and throwing the word rape around like that. But your husband needs to be the one who tells his family and, if they refuse to go, so be it. I understand it will be sad not having his parents there, but his family needs to learn that actions have consequences. Plus, I do not see his sister getting any better, so it would probably be best to go low/no contact with her for awhile. I am so sorry that you had to go through this, and good luck!"
"She's selfish dude, you need to run.  Anyone that holds out on you like that doesn't deserve you.  Find someone who actually respects you, don't stand for double standards."
"She will dig her own grave. Some do it slowly than others, I'd just let her."
"Well, how about marriage counselling to talk about it? The more he wants you to give up your job ... The more you need one for your own financial protection. Quitting the job would be isolatig for you and make you financially dependent on him."
"Agree, this is how it's supposed to be. I think I'd be tempted to contact the manager of the facility. I didn't realize red hair was so inherently difficult, but it makes sense, and having a skilled instructor (perhaps not the one who supervised OP's friend) salvage her hair to the greatest extent possible is probably a good lesson for the students. As in any sort of school, some teachers are great and others are slackers. 

Other commenters have mentioned having to sign a release form, and I had to sign one too, to get my hair done at a beauty school. But the manager and teachers still tried to make sure people had a good experience. If everyone is afraid of getting their hair butchered there, the school (and the salon that sponsors the school) gets an awful reputation."
"I wouldn't focus so much on the friend. The husband is the problem. 

You need to find out if he really wants to be with you and not just as a safety net. 

Ask him if he wants to be with you and if so, these are the conditions: 

- couple counselling
- no inappropriate relationships with any other women (don't even mention this specific woman - this is about him)
- support and affection from him 

Frame it as his choice. He can choose to stay with you and abide by the conditions, or not. Be prepared for him to say no and follow through and leave him. 

At least this way you will get a definitive answer and also he can't claim later that you forced him. He is choosing. 

You need an action plan for leaving him too. Just in case. 

edit: the 'lack of motivation' thing is mind boggling by the way. I'd never say anything like that about my wife to anyone. That is different than normal chat to a friend about your relationship. He might not love you any more. You need to find that out so you can move on if needed. 

Edit 2: I cannot get over that conversation he had with his friend about you. You might need to take a break from him and really think about if this is the guy you want to be with. How can you trust that he won't be talking shit behind your back again? It's unforgiveable. "
"Hey man, I'm a married lesbian in her late 20s who grew up in a home with pretty strong gender roles. So while I may not have a perspective on the ""gay male"" side, I do have a little bit that may be relevant.  Obviously there isn't as much stigma for lesbians as there is for men when it comes to top/bottom type roles in a relationship but my wife and I are pretty stereotypical in that I'm femme and she's butch. Of course there's more to us than all that but from appearances people do tend put us into boxes that make it easier to swallow.  

It can be hard for conservative people to accept reversed relationship roles, it's one thing in their minds for the wife to be domineering but it's different if say she was the main breadwinner and the husband was a stay-at-home dad.  Something like that is as equally baffling to them as gay couples that they can't immediately categorize.

As I said above, my wife and I appear to fit a conservative relationship model but when it comes to giving someone a hand with yard work or moving I tend to be the one to step forward and help. My wife has a severe spinal injury, is allergic to basically everything, has severe arachnophobia and doesn't do well with ""icky"" things. She can and has helped people move but it cripples her for a few days, so there are many of the more ""masculine"" duties that she can't do.

I've seen it a few times when someone expects her to do whatever ""manly"" work and then be very surprised when I do it instead.  Then they find out that I like rock and roll versus her love for 90s R&amp;B, but then I also love musicals and the ballet while her thing is EDM concerts.  These little things tend to baffle them as they have to keep switching us as to who takes the more dominant/masculine role in their eyes.

We're really just normal people with mixed interests.

Your family has probably been struggling since you came out, trying to reconcile which box they think you belong in and were unable to come to terms with you possibly taking a ""feminine"" place in your relationship.  Especially since I'm betting your bf isn't exactly a twink?  This confused them and they didn't know how to treat either of you.

There is probably a background of your father subconsciously mourning your masculinity as well as having out-dated/ignorant views on gay relationships.  People can't always imagine us as being exactly like them.  It's like because we're different in our attractions then we must be different in our relationships too.

You need to sit down and have a one-on-one chat with your dad.  Maybe have some samples of public gay relationships (or share him my post if you think it'll help, whatev's) 

I don't know how much change you'll get out of him though.  It sounds like your parents' own relationship operates under the same dynamic that they've used to understand you and your bf.  At most you may be able to get your dad to understand that you being with your bf doesn't mean that he gets an ""almost-daughter"" out of it but another son."
"Also, what's impressive about being with one person your whole life...? Probably contributed to this mess."
"I use the binary scale, makes things much simpler!"
"&gt; I'm sure he knows what he's doing and he does it anyways because your feelings, thoughts, and autonomy aren't as important to him as getting his dick wet. 

I said this above, but I actually don't think it's that her feelings aren't important to him. I think they are important in the sense that he gets off on forcing and coercing her. "
"Yup, and wanting to be a helpful friend, I signed my hair away."
"I also think it's sweet, we give people presents to mark other milestones in life, birthdays, graduations, and the like. Becoming parents is a big milestone and I'm thinking of getting my husband something to mark it when I have the baby. 

I'd be ticked to receive a wish list of items costing $5k+ though! Her expectations seem way out of line. "
"You seem like a real peach. Your defensiveness is what your BF is going to pick up on, not your porous memory. You should definitely be just as snarky with him, I'm sure it will make the situation so much better."
"He is a spoilt brat and it's dad fault. He is gay and dad has told mom to cut him some slack because he is having a hard time at school. 

I have not once seen anyone bully him, he enjoys the attention he got from our parents when he came out as gay, so he acts it up all the time. He wants attention simple as that. 

But even before he came out he was really bad. He would always run to dad for attention and get him to get mom to pay more attention to him. Now he uses being Gay as an ""excuse"""
"That may be part of why the mum is downplaying this in her own head. She knows what her son is describing is abuse and would report it if it was happening in another family, but as she doesn't want to believe her husband is abusive she's convinced herself that her kids are making things up and exaggerating."
"Sorry to butt in, but I think the reasoning is that they are only a decent person when they may get something out of someone/they benefit. A service person has to do their job no matter what, even if the customer is being rude, so a person like this doesn't bother put on the charm to get their way as they do think they need to. 

That's how I've always seen that point at least! "
"If she gets a job, not only will YOUR work hours stay exactly the same, but you would also have to pitch in around the house. How does that help your situation? You might be resentful and overworked now, but you'll only be even more overworked when you have to come home and do the chores that she couldn't do. And if she enjoys being a homemaker and you force her to get a job, she'll be resentful as well. Now you have two unhappy people in the house, both with more work than they used to have. 

Try to cut back your hours. Switch companies like you suggested in a different comment, or something along those lines. Making your wife get a job isn't going to ""even out"" anything - it'll just make you both unhappy."

"I know you're not the jealous type and trying really hard to be ""cool"" but do keep in mind that other people can also see you, and they can see that you're with a dude who can't peel his eyes away from other women.  Aside from the blow to your ego that he keeps doing it, it would be a huge blow to my ego to have everyone else noticing that he's looking everywhere but me.  

I agree that it's perfectly normal and healthy to look at other people, but most men are pretty much socialized from the moment they start looking at girls to be subtle about it, even when their girlfriend isn't present.  So I always see it as a red flag when a man is completely unaware of this social norm.  "

"As someone with a thigh tattoo that's not even that huge - it's not that secret of a spot unless you wear long pants and skirts 100% of the time.

Tattoo removal is 10x more painful than the actual tattoo, but depending on how dark and detailed the portrait is, that might be her only option if she decides she doesn't want it anymore.

I'm all for people getting their own tattoos, expect when:

1. It's a portrait of somebody else's face - they should be consulted and involved in the process
2. It copies someone else's tattoo without their permission "

"Wait until you two are married before buying a house. You are frankly are not compatible. Have you talked to a financial adviser to see how much you can afford? Is he going to help? Will he be able to help?

"Your husband has probably had a knee jerk reaction to something he was planning and anticipating himself for months, and he might be worried about the event too. Unfortunately because he recovered from his depression, he might have rose tinted glasses on with how easy it was to recover from. This certainly doesn't excuse his behavior though, your request is not unreasonable, and he is being a jerk.

Are you in counselling yourself? If so, it might be worth taking your husband along and re-explaining how you feel, with your therapist there, why this wouldn't be good for you right now. Your health, which in turn affects the baby, comes first.

"&gt;I think I bleed because I have massive anxiety about having sex. I don't really know why

your post is nothing but reasons to be anxious about sex. He badgers you, he bullies you, he coerces you and he flat out assaults you. I'd struggle to relax as well. 

I've been in a relationship like this and just...I know it's your call but please, please leave. This will damage you emotionally and physically, and the longer you stay the harder it will be to get past the issues he is creating. If you do not want to have sex and someone makes you do it (either by ignoring you completely, coercing, pressuring or manipulating you) that is *rape*. It's been two months and he is already doing this to you. It won't get better; it'll get worse. Please make yourself safe as soon as possible. "
"I think she misjudged her skill level, but you 100% owed her an apology.  

You started working on the draft weeks (months?) ago and didn't pull out until a couple of days before the deadline.  You screwed up her life.  You didn't mean to, but that's what you did.  And this might be the end of this friendship, which isn't the end of the world.  

I think you should only block people when you are worried about your safety or you have exhausted all other options.  AKA you've talked things through and told them at least once (I'd probably go for twice) that you no longer want to be in touch.  So I think blocking you (if she did) was out of line. But I know a lot of people block every time they get annoyed at someone.

At the same time, I don't find your response all that self-blaming.  It feels more like passing the buck.  ""I told you I wasn't good at social situations!"" is an excuse.  I get you have problems with conflict and that doesn't make you a bad person.

Is that email from her verbatim?  Because it is pretty fluent.  I don't understand why you would decide to write down her stream of conscious when she is able to write like that.  And *she* wrote the initial draft, you could have moved quicker to ""I can't fix this.""  I wouldn't be surprised if she managed to turn something in by the end of the month.  Do you have a tendency of taking too much on?  Of taking things over?

Another general thing- if you struggle with conflict try email rather than text.  It gives you more of a chance to think things over."
"I pity his wife. I really, REALLY hope that she understands how fucked up what he did is.

Edit to add: he says he didn't tell anyone about what happened. I wonder if his wife even knows that his sister won't talk to him because he beat her in front of her friends."
What excuses are they giving? 
"Good idea.

A bit like actual dating - instead of going ""I love you, be my girlfriend!"" and overwhelming her, you charm her first and ask for a date and so on ;) 

So you prepare your wife to think about the possibility instead of saying it out of the blue.

"&gt; not only she made none of the money herself

This is bull.  OP is able to work in a high pressure, high paying job while having a family precisely because there is someone at home, caring for the children and the house.  She's not a volunteer.  She's a partner in a mutually beneficial financial arrangement where her contributions are in kind, not dollars.  If you were to have to pay for child care and housekeeping, not to mention a personal assistant, you'd quickly realize the value of her contributions.  Half of those family finances are her's, both legally and morally.  

While I do agree OP's wife messed up big time, it has nothing to do with the outdated notion that none of the family's money is her own."
There was a case in the UK in 2006 (DPP v. Smith (Michael Ross)). The Court of Criminal Appeal held that cutting off one's girlfriend's hair (ponytail not plait in that case) was capable of amounting to assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

A silly fetish??? Where the hell did you get that?
"It sounds like your apprehension is coming from the idea that this could be the next chapter in your life together- that after one vacation in 5 star hotels and fancy restaurants that's all it will be, no more 50/50, and will eventually cause a divide between you two. That you don't want her to feel taken advantage of when you ultimately cannot keep up with her expenses. Maybe you could have a talk with her that you want to take the vacation, if she feels absolutely comfortable paying for the rest of the expenses that don't fit into your budget, but then you can set a comfortable boundary where you can compromise about how your future vacations will be. When you get back from your holiday you two can go back to 50/50. 

It sounds innocent enough from her side, like everyone else is suggesting that she just wants to go on a vacation with her bf. Consider the emotional happiness you bring to her, that truly is priceless. "

You seem to indicate that you spend more social time/party time with co-workers instead of your BF.  
Do you do ""fun"" stuff with your BF or is he your relaxation, ie not go out and do fun with person?  
I agree that no one other than yourself gets to dictate your life for you, unless you have an agreement in place to do so mutually.    
However I also note that you explain all these positive connections with the co-worker, the only thing you describe about the BF is his jealousy.  
Do you have anything about the BF positive to say?  "

"Yeah people who have cheated and are actually sorry about it don't lie to their current partner about it. I'll be honest and say I've cheated and yes I regret it. Do I lie to my current partner about it? No. He knew pretty much the week he met me. I don't lie about who I'm with or why unless I'm trying to surprise him for a birthday/event, in which case I don't feel that's lying. But if OP's husband didn't tell her because he thought she would be upset, she should now be upset because he lied. And if he does cheat on her on this trip I song be surprised and I won't be surprised if he tries to claim this girl came onto him. "

He bangs on your walls about noise when you're being silent? Have you thought about calling the cops or APS to do a wellness check? It's possible he could have dementia coming on.
"The thing about age gap relationships imo - you shouldn't be offended when people are inclined to make sure you're in a safe and healthy one. It can be tiresome, but it's born of love. If/When they find out your relationship is healthy, has parity of power and is for real, then it should settle. But it's fine for people to ask you and your SO about it - you should both have answers, and inherently acknowledge that it's the right thing to ask the questions of you both at this stage.

I say the above as someone who met her then-27 year old boyfriend at 20. People's misgivings were completely justified. When we proved that our relationship is respectful and healthy, they stopped, and now no one thinks of us as an age gap relationship (in no small part because, at 29 today, I don't come off younger than him any more).

ETA: this is referring to people you know and trust. Strangers are nosy and you can't know what they think of you, nor should you care. But examining the intentions of the people you love as well as their actions goes a long way to understanding why they are acting the way they are."

"Oh lord. I went to Aveda once,  someone I randomly met offered to cut my hair for free to build a clientele. She was a new graduate.

My appt was at 9am, I was hung over and looking forward to the chair. Nope. I had to put on an ill fitting, thin white robe. This salon had huge windows, and clients stood at the window ""to capture natural light"". 

I stood for almost an hour while this girl slowly cut my hair. After I left, someone in the parking lot told me the light made the robes see through so I had been exposing myself to a busy street for an hour.

Never again.  Hopefully they don't do weird experimental edgy stuff now. "

Do they also go nuclear when confronted with the end of the FWB agreement and threaten to not be friends with them ever again even though they've been friends their whole lives? Because that doesn't sound like no emotional commitment to me. 
That makes zero sense. Who cares what your natural hair color is? How could that possibly affect your relationship? This guy sounds crazy 
"I know, right?! I have NEVER had a creative job before that cared whether or not I sold shit online. In fact, my last employer (who was an artist) saw an assistant manager who moved an hour away and started to replicate all of her lessons/training. She didn't give one shit. I don't feel as though artists, in general, are taught to compete in that way. We have critiques where everyone puts their artwork up on the wall, and we all say (mostly) nice things about it. 

They would be DEVASTATED if I left, because like I said, I have changed this community. I literally have. I have one kid who has taken over 70 of my art classes in one year alone. She even took a camp at the Boys and Girls Club for two weeks because I was teaching there. She would have taken more classes with me, but she went on a cruise, and physically couldn't do it for at least six lessons. That should give you an idea of how much I do for this museum. I am routinely told that I have expanded their program beyond their wildest expectations."

"The only thing stopping me from giving this response was how informal the environment is, and the fact that he would like to keep his job.

It's always weird when I see posts about readings of the will with everyone present because that doesn't really happen...
"Well.. Yea.   If you were in a wheelchair bound,  and he dissed your wheelchair,  would that be OK?   If your dog were a child and he said it was annoying and not very cute,  would that be OK?   There are men out there who will bring love to your life and ADORE your best friend.   Give yourself the opportunity to find them. "
"&gt;The ex in question was my boyfriend for six months

Well there's your answer right in the second sentence. You really don't know why he doesn't want you to meet your ex while you are on a business trip? Just read this sub for, I dunno, a day and you'll see plenty of stories why he might be uncomfortable with this.

Everything after the second sentence is just you trying to justify why you should be able to go see your ex despite your *current* boyfriend, you know, the one you're actually in a relationship right now, being totally uncomfortable about it. But fuck what he thinks, right? Cause you want to go hang out with your ex.

&gt;But honestly, I'm 29 years old and I don't feel like I need my boyfriend's permission to do things

You don't. But he has every right to be uncomfortable with it just like you have every right to not ask for his permission. 

&gt;This isn't some old flame I carried a torch for for years. 

Really? Then why are you fighting so hard to go see him.

"Especially now that she's going into preschool and OP's wife isn't even responsible for her all day. That's why she suddenly is thinking homeschool, so she can hold on to her for the rest of her childhood (both for her unhealthy controlling nature and attachment).

"Again, your answer makes me think that you're a bit rough around the edges in terms of people skills. 

For example, you could have answered my post by saying, ""Thanks for the tips, but I already bring my clothing to tailors, and do my makeup well. Also, I understand that I'm responding rudely, but that's because I feel very attacked right now and just wish people would be a bit nicer to me. I am revealing my biggest insecurity online and it isn't easy!""

"The problem isn't that she went with her crush instead of OP. The problem is that she waited until the night of, as she and OP were meeting up to head to the prom, to tell hi she was going with someone else.

"You are right, it's the scale that is bothering me. I actually did date one girl in the past who made more than I did but we still came from similar backgrounds so it's not like she had all that money to splurge on me. It's definitely a weird feeling. "
"Now that you're working on finding a new job?  Find one as far away from where you're from as you can.

I can't emphasize this enough.  Get.  Away.  From.  Your.  Parents.

I had a lot of the same crap pressed on me (only child, also introvert, extremely sensitive) as a child.  Therapy did wonders for me - because it gave me the courage to do what I needed to do, which was move the hell away from where all the crap was coming from.

It's not that I don't love my parents or they don't love me.  But they were still a hugely negative force in my life.  So I upped and moved 2000 miles away.

They still tried the controlling crap when I first moved after they found out what I planned to do (go back to school for a 2nd undergrad in what I really wanted to do with my life), and I finally lost it.  Told them I was done trying to make them happy and I couldn't care about that anymore.  I had to make me happy, and if they didn't like it, that'd be too bad, but I was doing it anyway.

I highly recommend it, OP.  You've got to get away from the constant negativity."
"But what is the line you are crossing? What harm would it do to your relationship with Sherry if you told Rochelle or at least wrote a anonymous email? Absolutely nothing, that's what. This is Sherry abusing this power you've given her so that she's able to gloat over Rochelle some more.


I'll be honest, OP. There's a chance Sherry has already shared that video all over her friend group. If Sherry was my girlfriend, I'd be taking a good hard look at her insecurities and how she treats people she feels she has power or status over. I wouldn't be surprised if this negative aspect of Sherry came out more than you think it does. Sherry is probably very careful to not show you this side of her.


This is not a side of her that was created by you. This is a side she has always had, that she's kept hidden from everyone except the people she wants power or status over. In my opinion, she showed you that video to show you that Rochelle is actually a loser or something for being in a revenge porn vid, and that she is so much better than Rochelle because she's *totally* been *smart enough* to avoid it. Obviously that's all vile, but..."

"Yeah, I had exes that I thought were the love of my life at one time. And I knew he did, too. But I would never *today* say that I wish I hadn't let one of them get away. That's what's bothering me so much. That between stalking her on Instagram all night, saying that she was the one that got away, and telling letting his friends compare me to her and tell him that he should've picked me...I don't really feel like he would be with me if she was still an option.

"I have one of those weird, hard to spell names. The kind where it takes 5 minutes to introduce yourself and you end up giving up half the time anyway. Unfortunately, by the time I realized that my parents lied when they told me I was only allowed to have nicknames that came from my name, I was too well established in all of my social circles to do anything about it. I HATE my name with a burning passion, but I cannot seem to escape the damned thing. So I agree with you strongly in all that you have said."
"Okay, it's totally fine to be into the love-to-hate characters in book series.  I can see why your wife might have a special spot in her heart for characters like Cersei and Narcissisa. But surely your wife understands that giving your *child* a hard-to-spell and/or hard-to-pronounce name after a woman that has few redeeming qualities and many abhorent ones (incestuous mad queen or matriarch of a supremely racist household) is a really bad idea, not an awesome way to advertise her interests?

If she really wants something to name Cersei or Narcissa, get a cat, or name the car. There are heaps of women in literature and history who have kicked ass to be your daughter's namesake that don't have such shitty connotations as the above names. eg, Lilith, Boedica, Xena, Elizabeth, Joan (of Arc), Ripley. 

If she really thinks Cersei is a great character, then she can show her passion by jumping online to discuss it like everyone else. A child is not a car you put bumper stickers on to advertise your interests, especially if your interest is ""women of questionable morals"". And I can guarantee your daughter will hate you both for giving her a name that non-fans will find impossible to spell and/or pronounce, and fans will give her a weird side-eye and ask *her*, ""Why on earth did your parents name you after a incestuous mad queen?""

Honestly, it's like calling your son Adolf and saying, ""oh sure, he was a mad man who killed lots of people, but he did it with such *style*.""

Don't do that to your child. She's her own person, not a billboard for your wife's interests. Give her a name that will benefit *her*."
my father didn't make enough to feed everyone in our house sometimes and he got full custody and alimony.

"Hairdresser here. 

Sorry to hear about your hair. I suggest having it corrected at a salon, not the school. I suggest telling your friend in clear, emotionally neutral terms what you did not like about the hair itself, while avoiding judgement on her future career, that you got hungry, or that you had made lots of assumptions about her skill level and why she was asking you to do her the favor of being her model.

We are talking about a girl so new to hairdressing she couldn't even shampoo you without getting you wet. This is a very low skill level and expecting things like an even haircut, the target color level achieved, and to be out in a timely fashion, are, unfortunately, not realistic expectations for such a beginning student. 

This is par for the course what anyone should expect when they are a beauty school model. I butchered people all day every day that whole year and now own a successful salon. Don't assume your friend will never be successful just because she wasn't providing a salon quality experience yet. Everyone starts at the beginning. 

I'm sure an experienced stylist will be able to help you sort this out and wish you and your hair all the best. &lt;3

Most people respond to guilt. Insulting someone who's angry dehumanized them and makes it easier to continue insulting them. If OP starts acting hurt and soft, then the bully looks like a huge dick in front of everyone else and might actually feel bad about the things she's saying. 

Say things like ""that really hurts me"", and ""why are you saying these things? Why are you trying to hurt me?"". It's a win-win. She'll feel bad and look like the ultimate bitch for bullying someone who's being non-confrontational. "

"It sounds like having pets is really important to you and your life. A lot of people here are saying ""don't bring a pet into a household that doesn't want it."" But that's not really an option for you here, is it? You've already negotiated and comprised on the type of pet. You've heard his arguments but have agreed on something you both can live with. That's what being in a relationship is about, compromise. Why are looking to compromise more from your end? Your happiness matters too. 

Consider the future. Once you have a larger place, you want a dog right? But what if he asks you not to get one? What if he ends up saying he dislikes dogs too? Are you going to just not have pets because it's more important to make him happy than to make yourself happy? Get the cat he agreed to and start considering having pets a non-negotiable in your life. If he can't deal with that, maybe you aren't going to be long-term compatible. "

I know how frustrating this is. Many years ago, I was living with a woman who got along great with my best friend and his wife, and then one day the wife would have nothing to do with my girlfriend. I'm guessing my girlfriend must've unknowingly said something very hurtful or triggering to my friend's wife, but I never did find out what happened."
"Actually you *are* doing the 'nice guy' routine, where you pretend you are the friend of a girl you want more from. You are available for planning and driving to try to stay near her, and you describe this as something you have done before.

If you want to date a girl and she says no, then don't break your own heart by hanging out and driving her places. 

Like others have said here, you'd probably not blame a guy friend for taking off if he had a chance with his ex."
"&gt; I saw the title and skimmed for the word pregnant.

Yep, this. I will quote myself from other post, that I think it applies here.

&gt; *""Keep in mind that pregnancy can ""mindfuck"" someone. And I'm not (only) talking about the sudden discovery, but hormones. This intensifies woman's emotions and it isn't rare that, in this context, they can make some irresponsible/sudden/thoughtless decisions. Not that it justifies everything that has happened, but it explains it.*""

As many people have said here, yep. Pregnancy is hard, any woman can do things that they would never do otherwise. It's a hormone bomb, not unlike what people go through in teenage years. 

I know it's hard, but try to endure it. "
"This is where you go with this option from above. Maybe tone it down just a bit with the first sentence. ""In respect to Lily's beliefs we have chosen not to invite her to our wedding which will be fully funded with money from an obviously non-vegan business. "" So you make your point, she doesn't show, it's her fault she's not showing and if she wants to grow up into an adult some day you can have that conversation. Seriously, she's a child."
"People that have to be right all the time are not people I want to be around.  Sure, being wrong sucks and might be a little embarrassing, but that's life.  This guy OP is with (and your ex?) sound exhausting to me."
"Marriage counselling, stat.  As a former pregnant lady and current SAHM, this could be a delusion that was created by crazy pregnancy hormones, or this could be something she planned all along, but either way, you guys NEED a marriage counselor immediately because you need a referee to convey to her that you guys cannot afford for her to be a SAHM and you *definitely* cannot afford a push present.

For the record, I suppose I got a ""push present"".  It was a $20 set of shower gel and soap for me to bring to the hospital to make my post-delivery showers a little more pleasant, and I bought it myself."
"Yes, I would have, if I remembered, actually. 

I explained this in another comment, but when Sam told me he was coming and I offered my couch, it was a month in advance. I was dealing with a lot of other things at the time, I was very busy planning a lot of things. Then my boyfriend started planning his trip, and I was excited and occupied with that. Then he came, so obviously my attention has been on him the last week. So it slipped to the back of my mind because it wasn't something I had to deal with. I absolutely, 100% forgot. People forget things when they're busy.

I'm not excusing myself, it's still my fault and I really fucked up by forgetting. But my boyfriend was sitting right next to me on the couch when I got Sam's text with his flight info. I was just as surprised by it as he was. I did not ""forget"" to tell my boyfriend. I actually forgot."
"&gt;I still cried and said sorry a million times when I got a positive test. We both really wanted to be parents at some point but when it happened I immediately felt like I ruined his life. 

And does that feel like a healthy thing to you? I'm having real trouble believing your relationship was healthy when your response was saying sorry when you got pregnant. "
"I always find it funny when other subs complain about this one because 99% of the answers are just ""break up"", but when you actually read the type of shit in these posts it's like, yeah, 99% of the answers are ""break up!"" You're not fixing this level of crazy with compromise and patience. "
"&gt;I don't trust my boyfriend anymore(there has been a lack of respect in our relationship for a long time).

Honestly, this is the answer. You don't trust him and there's a lack of respect in the relationship. I think it's time for you to seriously consider what you are getting out of this relationship, and if it is time to move on. No healthy and fulfilling relationship lacks trust and respect. "
"There are many women out there, myself included, who LOVE men with lots of body hair.


Own it, dude."
Because showers = cheating! Gotta clean all that filth off from your affair! /s
"I would suggest telling the cops that you are putting yourself in physical danger by calling them, and that he has assaulted you in the past and threatened to kill your dog.  They need to know what they're dealing with.  Someone like that could easily turn out to be a child beater, too.  You already know he's willing to neglect his own child.  You need to think about your niece's safety, given that he's violent.  Make sure you tell them that you're 16, so they know you're a minor."
"I really don't know how I will cope if this ends. I'm pretty thick skinned but he has been my only boyfriend and I still love him so much. I feel guilty because I know it's a big change for everyone in my life. 
Thank you for your comment, I will try and talk to him again about all of this. "
"""I wouldn't have had it end"" is in no way the same as ""I wish it were still the case"". The prior is a comment about a past state of mind and the latter abouy a current one."
"Wow, they are super greedy. 3k is a LOT of money to pay for someone else's kid to go to college. You are not responsible for your relative's financial situation or lack of foresight in saving for a pricey education. You were so generous, I'm sorry you are being treated poorly."
"She's definitely trying to throw a wrench in your relationship. Whether or not you can trust your boyfriend is another thing altogether. He could have changed, and he probably has if you were discussing children together.
But if you can't trust him 100%, then you'll have to work on that or end it. "
I like to wave it around like a lasso 
Sounds reasonable.  Happiness is a zero sum game after all.  Reducing her happiness frees up more potential happiness for you!  
"there is a creepy vibe to it, right? I can't entirely put my finger on it but...it's not nearly as romantic as she thinks it is."
You can't change someone. So don't try. Accept who he is or break up with him. You are doing both of you a disservice. 
"Remind her of her words. Which is more important to her: a marriage or what kind of stone is in her ring.

Tell her that you did your best but could either get her the style she wants, or the stone she wants but not both. 

I understand wanting a nice ring because you have to wear it forever, but if she loves how it looks but is hung up and pouting over the stone that just seems beyond silly and childish to me. "
"Seriously WTF. They need to be in therapy, not adding extra people to their sex life."
"He has the right to go to his own fathers funeral, he just doesn't have to interact with his sister.
Get the info and go with your bf to support him."
"If a simple comment from a four year old can lead to that kind of outburst from your wife, she has some serious unresolved issues. You shouldn't have to accept her accusing you of cheating on her with her sister. You should be pushing her harder to get some therapy. "
"Workaholics don't temper with age.  

Attorneys don't suddenly stop having work in their 30s."
Or someone with absolutely less than no self respect. 
"If you are the result of an affair your mother had with another man, your brother is likely misdirecting his anger at you for ""breaking up his family."" He's mad &amp; by assaulting you with a baseball bat he is punishing you for this perceived action. 

But you should know that no matter what truth is, your parents divorce was not your fault. If your mother cheated, that was her choice - you had no control in the situation &amp; there was nothing you could have done differently to change things.

I think the first step would be to ask your sister point blank if your father is not actually your biological father. If she declines to answer it, I think you should call your father up &amp; ask him yourself. It's scary to try to find out the truth, but you deserve to know. Because none of their treatment of you is your fault."
"His relationship with his daughter doesn't mean that you aren't close. What do you want from him in regards to your son? He can't make him better.If your mom is making all of the money and choosing to support him, they need to work as a team. His children are just as much a priority as you are. I wasn't necessarily talking about the money though. Her whole attitude towards his daughter sounds like she is jealous of her too, which is why I said she sounds immature.I'm sorry that things are hard now. It does sound like the post partum hormones are wreaking havoc on you though. "
"Yes, but she's also 30 lbs thinner and presumably has been since they started dating. These remarks were made when she was heavier. She's worried that he'll think she's gross again if she gains the weight due age or having kids. Not an unreasonable fear. 

Also, I never said he had to prove anything; he has to convince (i.e., reassure) her. There's a difference."
"It's been six months.  This is who he is.  

This is how he will treat you every time something like this happens.

Don't accept this bullshit.  Delete, block, no contact, gym, tinder, std test.

Or, you know, just dump him and go eat some ice cream or whatever you do to feel better."
Humiliations is illegal.... That's adorable... You just hold on to that.  Lol
Why does your ex think jasmine broke up the marriage if you didn't meet her till after the divorce?
"""I'd shake your hand, but I'm afraid you might be contagious."""
"My name is one of the oldey-time ones you mentioned :( 


I mean, it sucks but at the same time it's more unique and I wasn't teased about it. It may be an old lady name, but old ladies were once hot too!


To be helpful though, it's definitely weird and disrespectful of him to just go ahead and call her whatever he wants. What was the point of even choosing a name together then??? And who's to say he won't keep using it everywhere else, with his excuse always being that you won't encounter those people when x event ends?"
"&gt; take his time finding a job that will make him happy

This was your first mistake.  You have given him an out to never find work because the qualifier is that he has to be something that will make him happy.  Goal #1 isn't to find a fun job, but to find one that will support you.  

&gt; will likely move out in a year once he can buy a house again.

Nope.  Too fluid.  He can make excuses as to why he isn't ready.  He pays rent to you know and moves out in a few months when he can RENT his own place.  You don't owe it to him to let him save up for a damn mortgage.

&gt; I've asked him to stop but he just says ""I know you like it.""

But because of this, he gets the hell out of your home NOW.  Give him whatever notice is legally required by your state and he can GTFO.  He's had 7 months to get his shit together and is now so comfy in YOUR home that he is sexually harassing you.  I can't believe you are willing to give him ""another year"" or so.

You tell your husband immediately.  This is what spouses do.  If you can't, your marriage is not a strong one.
"
"&gt; He began yelling and ranting that he doesn’t “mean any of it,” that I “shouldn’t let it affect the relationship,” he “isn’t like that anymore,” “it was a one-time thing,” and he “really does love me.”

I feel like this does sound a little off-putting, at the *least*."
"I disagree. A female should speak with her about what a pad is, how to use them, and what to expect. Then the topic should be dropped. If she was sexually abused and doesn't know what a period is, she could think something else is going wrong and freak out."
"I see at least three red flags with OPs bfs behavior, past and present. "
"There are very few reasons to contact an ex.

Finding out their secret fetish is absolutely not one of them, that would not benefit either of you at all.

Best advice is to not focus on it, don't obsess. This guy is clearly not okay, he's got a lot of shit to sort out, but that's not your concern any longer."
"When I had my wisdom teeth out I thought I had had a baby, and was mildly curious about why the doctor was sending me home without my newborn. I was 0% upset, just like ""oh, ha, funny story you guys, I had a baby at the dentist."""
These are all normal things that people should at a baseline expect from their partner. Why are your standards so low?
This is so true omg
"You don't have a cheaters brain, you're just an asshole. Your brain is not *making* you cheat, you just don't respect your partners. Don't be in a monogamous relationship if you can't stop yourself from cheating. 

If you love your boyfriend and don't want to hurt him, just don't cheat. It's literally that simple. You're just making excuses for yourself."
"Sound advice. In the meantime, if douchebag dad doesn't think boyfriend is a ""man"", I'd take that as an immense compliment to boyfriend."

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA shit
"Guilt trips are more on us than they are on the givers. I was raised by a fucking Jedi level narc so I'm very well experienced in the art of guilt trips. From a child's perspective, it's hard not to rely heavily on a parents perception of us since they are supposed to be tasked with helping us navigate life and protecting us as we figure it out. Not all parents are wired this way. 

Whether she's getting off on robbing you of things you're fond of, ocd-style solving everyone else's problems, or the image of most selfless giver known to man, or even all of the above: she's purposely &amp; knowingly against your objections setting you up in a lose-lose situation where either way she wins. If you say yes she gets her ego fix AND flaunts control over you. If you say no she can make you feel like shit while playing victim to others. 

My moms conditioning of me involved SO many other factors but this was a big one. It was hard to break the mold, but I was finally confident in MY narrative of MY life and MYSELF. I was able to say 100% that she was wrong, insane, and full of shit. Once I could do that her guilt trips never worked again &amp; I could shut her down with ease. Not an instant fix, but definitely food for thought. Good luck!! "
I just don't understand what she saw that I didn't see. She is a bit of dramatic person but never with this sort of magnitude. She is a good mom and a good friend and never had a meltdown like this. Thats is why I wish I understood what was really going on here.
"The thing I'm not getting is that he has no problem with her having a private account. But she has a problem with HIM having a private account. If she'd just been like, 'yeah, you can have one too and we will put the same amount into it per month', there would be no reason for her to be scared of him finding something out by looking at her account."
"I wonder if she realizes that ""making it work"" includes not buying frivolous things like push presents..."
"I am a product of r-pe. Thus my grandparents are very wary of that usage around them. It was also quite shocking for them to deal with in a pleasant setting in their home, after being very accommodating for her last minute. The confrontation is very shaking They planned on going to the ceremony just not the reception. 


And yeah when anyone is black and white there is no point in telling them that grey exists."
"Hahaha thank you for this. She's definitely an oddball. But her thing is that she's had 0 boyfriends that I know of. And the other thing at play is that i get the feeling she thinks we are like overly sexual people that talk about this all the time bc we go there and we are not. 

I would shit if she has some kind of fetish. It would actually be awesome. I'd have to shake her hand for trolling everyone into believing she was so simple. "
"Don't couples who decide to go unprotected do so because they are clean and *will remain that way*? If he's sleeping with other people, he's not really upholding that end of the bargain, ie not risking getting something. "

"I think for some it is a reaction to being pressured and harassed to have kids. Like I said in another comment, when I was young people would get really bent out of shape about it. For some reason people I barely knew thought it was really important to talk me into having kids. 

Especially when you are young, if you feel like your choices are being attacked and critiqued all the time, there's a rubber-band effect."
"I see so many posts here with a person asking some variation of ""how can I make my partner *understand* that this or that abusive behavior is not okay""? But the problem is never with them not understanding. They understand. They just don't give a fuck. Not only do they completely understand that it's hurtful; the entire reason they are doing it is because it is hurtful."
"Please just enjoy yourself. If you go looking for cues that she is trying to control you, you might find them even if they aren't there. You are letting your pride get in the way of something that sounds pretty great. Just relax, and remember that she's not using you for money and you know you're not using her. She sounds super sweet."
"And from the POV of your girlfriend, I would argue that keeping a whole second spying job isn't even comparable to asking a guy out a few times. 

Also, you only even know this stuff because you *hacked into your girlfriends private conversations*. And her **bank account**! Let's just skim over the fact that you could potentially have committed fraud here! Like, back the fuck up here. *You* are in the wrong, and you're only justifying it by whinging that you didn't know she has a crush on someone else, and there was a 6 month fling she kept to herself. Boo hoo. Big fucking deal. *She is allowed to keep secrets*, and **you** are not allowed to gain access to other peoples private bank accounts!"
"You seem very aggressive and fatalistic, you would likely benefit from therapy.

"I'm not the OP, but I'm in a similar situation. I lost 80 pounds and have kept it off for a good long while (down to 125 at 5'5""), but when I started weight training was when the attention *really* began. 

It's…weird. At first, it was a huge ego boost that I was getting stared at and chatted up; I'd never had that before in my life. Now I mostly just have to ignore it. I've found that I'm a lot less friendly to strangers than I used to be because being smiley can attract unwanted attention. 

That said, I would never, ever go back. People also take me WAY more seriously now. They listen more closely when I talk. I'm confident and calm, two things I never could be as fat me. Even with the downsides, your life will be so much better you won't believe it. Plus, your dating pool will expand exponentially. ;)"
"Except you have no grounds on which to make that assumption. It's not like he's out there bragging about his sexual offense - he may be trying to keep it under wraps because he's ashamed of a drunken mistake he made in college. Obviously OP can draw his own conclusions about the character of the guy, but if he's given no indication of being an asshole other than this, I'd say OP is overreacting. "
"My mother had done some really terrible things because of her drug addiction. I never respected her as an adult and we had a very shaky relationship. However when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer the past didn't matter anymore when she came asking me to hear her out at least.

Natalie has never done anything to you, OP. You have never met Natalie, OP. These jealousy issues are coming from some other issue that you should try to get to bottom of. 

The way you write about Tim --- as if he has no right to pay attention to his own daughter, who is also pregnant (can you relate to that in any way?) --- is absolutely irrational. You're fixated on getting his attention and you're resenting someone who seemingly is taking away his attention in a really disturbing way. 

You write yourself that you're jealous and desperate, so at least you acknowledge that there's something not right about how you are looking at things.

Please get yourself into counseling. This fixation on Tim's attention isn't normal."
If it was an event in town I could maybe see that making sense. However she has to drive two hours to a cottage they have rented yet isn't joining them in the activities (golf and beers) they are doing locally in our city the Friday night.

"My sister does shit like this. She'll take a situation, twist it to make her the victim, embellish the hell out of it, and post it online. I don't think it's that she thinks shit happened that way, she just wants the attention from online friends. She also posts how she's constantly sick if there's been a lack of drama in her life for a week. I'm not defending your husband OP, but perhaps he's done all this for similar reasons.

"Also he prioritized keeping a good face with his colleague rather than clearing it out *immediately* what was happening! He was there, he saw you kissing a man (or rather imagined it), and decided that doing *nothing* and keeping the appearances was more important than finding out what was happening with the woman of his life.

We can do nothing but guess why she is upset. If it's nothing listed here then go talk to *her*. Ask her why she's upset. 

As for the bro/sis moment...Just because she didn't share it with you doesnt mean it didn't hold value or an emotional attachment to it. Clearly, we can agree that she wanted to sell it... But maybe she want to be the one to let it go.

Again we are all guessing. What is she saying about it?"
"You're right. However, child care workers like this do exist, albeit rather expensively. Also, such a ""difficult"" child would need specialized childcare. By ""professional"" I meant someone with experience dealing with high needs children, not a 15 y/o girl. As of right now, the child can't even be watched for an hour, so a weekend away is a lofty goal. What I was trying to get across to OP is that they aren't entitled to free childcare from his in-laws, even if they do so for the niece. Unfortunately, the child is so unpleasant to be around that, if they want childcare they will have to pay for it. I'm not suggesting they hire someone random person on CL and leave the kid for the weekend."

"Good idea. Perhaps tell them the money came from a one-off share dividend or the company you work for changed hands. Link that with the financial planner and a trust that drip feeds money to them, good to go. 

Possibly think about having the trust revert back to you when your parents pass away, not become part of their estate. "

"&gt; She disagrees with them, but goes along with it because it is easier. 

Is it, though?  She's 23.  If she puts her foot down and moves out, one of two things is going to happen: either her parents will realize they can't control her any more and accept the situation even if they don't like it, or they don't talk to her but at least she gets to make her own adult decisions without being second-guessed or hassled over them all the time.  If she's okay with the current dynamic, then you are effectively signing up for a lifetime of not being in control of your own relationship and family because her parents will always get the final say.  Which is *not* how relationships are supposed to work, and decidedly *not* easier - at least on you.  If I were you, I'd tell her to look you up if and when she decides to cut the apron strings, and walk away."

"You found it uncomfortable when you choose to click on your girlfriend's Facebook pictures because she has a life, and a past, that includes an ex.

Solution: Don't go exploring her past Facebook pictures.

She has a past. She has a life. She's lived it. At some point, she cared for her ex and also had sex with him. There is nothing wrong with any of that. If that makes you uncomfortable that either means you have a problem you need to solve inside of yourself, or, she's a bad match for you. If the trigger here is past Facebook photos, that falls firmly into the 'You have a problem' column. 

It's very nice that you have a specific way in which you like to interact with your past Facebook photos and untag yourself. That fine. You are allowed to make that choice for yourself. Expecting her to conform to your preferences around past Facebook photos is really not cool. If a guy expected me to change my behaviour about past Facebook photos to conform to his opinions and discomfort over the fact I had dated other people in my life, I'd see that as a huge red flag. 

This problem could be solved by only the tiniest bit of self-control on your part. Don't go looking for things you know will make you uncomfortable."
"This is true. I'm a woman and I do not like scrawny skinny guys. I only weigh about 105, so its just too boney (pun intended). I prefer thicker guys.

I loved him, and that's all that mattered. "
"Who the fuck invites a chick to an out of town bachelor party trip? Not appropriate! Do any of these douchebags have girlfriends or wives?

"I'm going to have to say that she is being ridiculous. It sounds like she didn't want you to have fun without her, and expected you to sit at the table with her the whole time. That's unfair of her. If she didn't want to dance, she could have spent time taking pictures or something. There is no reason why you shouldn't have been able to do what you did. 

Is this the only time she has been unreasonable like this? "
"&gt; I tried to explain it's about sharing or at least guest etiquette and she seemed annoyed by that.

Yeah, I would be annoyed too because it's rude to insinuate someone is not following guest etiquette, especially over eating 'too much' deli meat.  I'm also confused why OP isn't providing the lunch meat or another alternative if he doesn't want his girlfriend to eat his parent's lunch meat.  Also, did you even tell her that the lunch meat was for your parents?  And did you give her an alternative or something else to eat?"
"So far I have been unwilling to do anything drastic because I didn't want to make our situation worse. I now see that nothing I do can make things worse than they already are. Sadly, I don't see my dad being helpful. Our church attendance was sporadic when I was a kid because of some problems with its leadership. We used to pray together at night and read the Bible sometimes, but again, that was sporadic. My mom did always seem more spiritual than my dad; because we were at home with her all day, we saw more spiritual focus from her. To my dad, respect is total blind obedience. He doesn't leave any room to disagree without trying to take something from us or pushing us away.  He does respect our church's pastor. I am strongly considering approaching him with this situation."
"At the very least she's having an emotional affair, and it's only a matter of time and logistics before it becomes physical. 

I would talk to her and ask for a password to her phone, and I'd ask her to let you see the conversation(s) with guy in question. 

Her reaction to that request will tell you everything you need to know.

"Of course your parents deny it, do you really think they'd admit to something that heinous?"
I was calling you naive.
"This is a good point. What happens when the anonymous email is sent and then Claire comes to OP looking for support? Does OP just lie about knowing about it?

"No, that doesn't count. She has to be there for you to do everything for her that she does for you. Otherwise it's just a bachelor-style holiday for you. And it's way easier to clean up after one person. 

I stayed at home for a few months while I was between jobs after relocating, and I - like your wife - loved it. I found it incredibly fulfilling to be able to provide for my husband in that way and meet his needs so he could relax when he came home. But it wasn't easy. I didn't have a lot of down time, even in a small house. Maybe an hour a day where I'd have lunch. I'm not saying your wife works 60 hours, but she's working a job. It's just not one you're recognising as such. The only difference between you and her is that she loves her job and you hate yours. Change yours, not hers. It's not fair to make her miserable to keep you company."
"I'm amazed none of the higher-up comments are saying this. OP, do something **immediately** to ensure that your wife is locked out of that money. There's no need for her to access it right now anyway, so make sure it's sealed tight so she can't go behind your back and give it all to her family."
"Agreed. From reading this, it's obvious that you don't want to date this guy, and that if you go it's only going to end badly. You're not obligated to go on a date with him, just cancel."
Gross. My boyfriend has a twin brother and if he ever suggested anything like this it would be he end of the relationship. The fact that he has such little respect for you that he would discuss this with his brother without even telling you is a huge sign that the relationship is headed downhill. 
"&gt; my wife's cousin is supposedly finishing culinary school and he says he will be the chef.

That makes it even scarier."
Absolutely. For women with breasts that size it's physically painful! And she can try and see where they are coming from- perhaps a compromise like chucking a hoody on top of whatever she's wearing? Sure this is a bit silly a trivial among adult women- she's not parading naked- but for the sake of peace and comfort all round sometimes one has to compromise.
"Fffs it makes me so mad. It's fucking tragic that the dog had to endure so much fear and stress under the guise of ""rough-housing"" and ""look he's wagging his tail"". Like I'm pretty sure my dog would bounce back and play with me if I threw him around or intimidated him, but that doesn't make it okay. If someone made my dog urinate from fear I'd give them a broken nose, not a stern talking to.

What's even weirder is in her comments she fully realizes he'll be a horrible father, but seems to be in this weird limbo between acceptance and denial? She knows it's going to happen and doesn't like it, but won't actually take any steps to not have to live her life that way."

"I know you think it's overblown, but believe me it's not. I've been trained to spot signs of human trafficking as partof my job and this is one of the classic routes. I'm telling you now, if you go to Prague and pay a tonne of money to people you don't know on the hope it will help you become a model, you will end up with your passport taken off you, in some grotty pay by the hour hotel, fucking men for 6 euros a time. I'm not exaggerating, I've looked at tonnes of case studies. This happens all too frequently and Prague is a hotspot for it.

There is no conceivable way that this is not is a scam. No modelling agency worth working for, will charge you. If you have got what it takes to be a model, all agencies will handle that shit for free. Why? Because they'll make money from you modelling. If they're asking for money upfront, it's a scam. Google modelling scams.

"OP should ask her parents if they're going to treat her future children differently too, if they aren't raised catholic. If that is the case, then OP should warn them that she won't want her future children around grandparents who are going to treat them differently because of their (non)religion. Seriously some grandparents buy more expensive gifts for Xmas/birthdays for kids who they believe we're ""raised right"", while shafting other grand kids in the same room with cheap gifts, this shit is fucked up."

None of the advice here is inappropriate for your son's age. He's showing logical reasoning skills. This is how daddy speaks to mommy= this is how you speak to mommy. This isn't a wait till after the bar for counselling situation this is a need to be addressed now. And you fix it with your husband being honest with his son. 
No he hasn't been fixed because he told the child not to lie. If he had been fixed he would have acknowledged what he has done in the past and show the toddler that it isn't okay.

"Let me pick out some quotes from your post:

&gt; After hearing from him that he didn't find me attractive I was hurt so deeply and as a result became depressed.

&gt; I was never a crazy stalker gf, it isn't apart of my character, but after hearing something so hurtful, I started to snoop into my boyfriends accounts.

&gt; he tells me out of the blue I'm unattractive

Even without talking about the girl explicity, it sounds like this guy brings out some bad behaivor in you.  It seems a little ... strange to obsess with someone over Facebook or whatever and not know them, but even ignoring that, him telling you that you're unattractive (twice!) and the lack of trust you have for him tells me that this isn't a healthy relationship.  I'm not sure why you don't want to dump him even though he sent you in to depression and turned you in to someone that snoops on Facebook.  

As an aside, it kind of sounds like he wants to break up with you, but he doesn't have the stones to do it and is hoping that you will break up with him.


edit: I also just did the math and realized you two started dating when you were 15.  Yeah, this relationship isn't healthy.  You sound like you've become really emotionally dependent on him (I'm guessing this was your first serious relationship?).  How much effort do you really want to spend on someone that makes you feel this way?"

"The amount of comments in this thread of people that are just ABSOLUTELY not okay with you offering your lifetime friend, who happens to be a male, a place to stay is just atrocious and bordering middle school maturity. And the amount of people suggesting you to kick him out last minute and on top of that pay for his expenses is... so far fetched. Since when did young people just have hundreds of dollars to throw away to hotel fees? I think reddit is on the defensive here, not you. 

Reading your other posts in this thread, your boyfriend trusts you with the fact that this man is staying in your home (I mean, especially because he'll be in bed with you). He's upset at the fact that he has to sacrifice 2 nights out of 3 weeks? Sorry but, tell him to stop being a brat! "
"I'm 98% certain [this is from your sister](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m3h3e/me_15f_with_my_biological_brothers_1419_m_i_think/?st=iqtjhr7q&amp;sh=2407126e), if you want her perspective on things, and you can see the advice people gave her.

If this is your sister, she might just want to avoid questions about why if she is your biological sister she didn't grow up with you, and I assume she looks like y'all so introducing her as ""your sister now"" could also be confusing and raise questions of why if she's adopted do you look so similar. I think being introduced as a cousin could work, it admits your family, but justifies her life away from y'all while growing up. I would talk it over as a family and see how you want to present it to people, and get all of your stories straight

As for your relationship. I would just listen to her, and support her however she wants/ accepts. She was going to therapy and interested in going with you, but it sounds like y'all declined and she didn't want to press the issue. She is comfortable talking with a therapist, so it might be worthwhile for you to take her up on her offer and go with her and your Dad. Her therapist might be able to help the two of you form a bond, and help you understand more about her life, and how it will impact your relationship with her. She has been through a lot. More than you or I will likely ever have to face and she still has her whole life ahead of her. She has even admitted being scared to get close to y'all for fear something bad with happen to you. 

This is all very new for her and she has been going through some things. I think continuing to bond with her outside of school, just treat her like you would a new friend. Take her to the movies, buy her a burger, feel free to have some inside jokes, just little things to help her realize you and your brothers are there for her if not as brothers yet, than at least as friends."

"Why were you going upstairs in the first place? The problem that you caused with her car was not fixed.

What if you broke a vase of hers? What you did was pretty much give her the shards and the glue and make her put it together. Then when she got mad at you for not helping your response is to tell her you apologized and tried to fix the problem.

But see, you didn't actually try to fix it. You set her up, but you still gave it to her to fix like the metaphorical vase. Then you left and expected everything to be hunky dory because you totally did all you could. 

Do you see why she might be mad and you should* apologize?"
"Dude, you're really thinking this is weirder than it actually is.

I've always loved kind of historic children's books like that and Alice in Wonderland, and I read them for comfort all the time.

"That one wasn't in stock anymore, but me and husband ended up finding another one we liked even better at least."
"From Lundy Bancroft's *Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men* (a book you will find useful):

""Partner abuse tends to escalate. One of the causes of mounting abuse is that the abuser gets frustrated by the effects of his own abusiveness, which he then uses as an excuse for more abuse. For example, you as the partner of an abuser may have become increasingly depressed over time, because chronic mistreatment is depressing. Now he gets angry about the ways in which your decreased energy make you cater to him less enthusiastically. Similarly, abuse may diminish your drive for sex, and then he is hurt and enraged about your lack of desire for him.""

This issue will only continue to spiral unless your husband makes a sincere effort to arrest his anger. Here Bancroft details some of the leading indicators that verbal violence will turn into physical abuse:

- When he is mad at you, does he react by throwing things? Does he use violent gestures such as swinging his arms around in the air to show his rage? Have you been frightened when he does these things?

- Is he willing to take responsibility for those behaviors and agree to stop them, or does he justify them angrily?

- Can he hear you when you say that those behaviors frighten you, or does he throw the subject back on you, saying that you cause his behaviors, so it's your own problem if you're scared?"
"In my experience the gap between 16 and 19 is greater than 19 and 22 for example.

But we can ignore that. Friends will always be upset with friends dating their family members.

Which one do you value more?"
"She hasn't messaged you? Good. Don't message her either. Apologize to your brother for the upsetting situation, enjoy the rest of your visit with him, and don't date rude people in the future."

"I honestly think your parents should step up a little. I have a thirteen year old boy who can be lazy but I simply do not tolerate bad hygiene. I check to make sure he brushes his teeth twice a day and showers. He also does his own laundry and must wear clean clothes and deodorant to leave the house.   

That is parenting. Until he is successful in self-directed hygiene and life skills related to that his parents should intervene. The goal is for them to grow into successful adults- not stinky bums. 

We are exceedingly honest with him: if he stinks we say something and then require him to act on it immediately. I would ask your parents to parent. Why are you responsible for buying him hygiene products?"

"While I agree with the sentiment... OP, don't do this. The majority of people would agree you are not selfish or unreasonable to have your own separate account. However, if you want to have a successful marriage, going behind your wife's back (even if she is being unreasonable) is not the way to go.

"&gt;Her mom got very drunk at our engagement party and basically told me I screwed up Lisa and my fiance's possible engagement and I would never let him see her anymore.

Yeah, that's pretty relevant info. Tell him this is why Lisa cannot come."
"Agree, but would add that it's not even a case of him 'picking up' when she needs some kind of attention. His behavior is beyond the mere missing of cues. He knows what is required - and in the face of that, he chooses to show flagrant disregard, to humiliate her, and to make her feel actually worthless. Any pleas, requests and protestations she makes are similarly - and willfully - disregarded and ignored. 

OP, the picture you paint of DH screams of the classic symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (or worse, on the spectrum of Cluster B disorders). I'd add that personality disorder is not a 'mental illness'; it is WHO THE PERSON IS. 

He knows what he is doing here. He makes no attempt to hide it - this is egosyntonic behavior, in that he clearly feels no shame about it - when an emotionally/mentally healthy person WOULD. He rubs your face in his flirtations. And he exaggerates his flirtations (e.g. going on and on and on about the 'hot nurse' for 2 weeks afterwards; repeating the 'netflix and chill' remark to the babysitter after you expressed what it meant (he knew anyway!) and asked him not to say that again.) He is getting off on rubbing your face in this. 

He is playing with your emotions to get a painful reaction from you - look at this and you will see it is the case. Why else would he go on and on about the nurse in that way, for example? He could have kept the thought to himself. 

NPD's enjoy humiliating their partners in this way. They enjoy power and control, denying you what you want and need (and giving it to someone else - that's a big thrill for them), putting his own selfish (and frankly petty) needs first and completely ignoring yours. Ugh. I had an NPD ruining my life for a while and my heart goes out to you in this situation. I am glad to say; I left him. 

There is no cure for this. You say you won't leave so the best advice I can give you is ""gray rock"" and ""the 180 rule"". Please google these things, but in brief it means hiding what hurts you, hiding what is important to you, becoming more independent and less in the palm of his hand. You can not tell him or show him what hurts you, nor what is important to you, because those are the things he will target. 

In the face of this, it is important to change your reaction to his games. To show no reaction - so that he can not feed in this way off your emotions any more. Better yet, laugh at him the next time he does this (and every time thereafter) - even MOCK him for it. It is the exact opposite of what he's come to expect. When his 'quick payoff' vanishes - and better still, leads to the OPPOSITE of a feed on your pain and feeling he is 'hot shit' because he upset you by giving his attention to another woman - he may up the ante - please, don't bite. Keep laughing at him. And when you react differently (especially the very first time), please keenly (but not obviously) observe his reaction to your change in response. Pay attention and you will catch some confusion - and maybe even a flicker of horror - on his face when he realizes his humiliation game is not working any more. He will keep trying - don't cave. When he knows FOR SURE that it has stopped paying off (and you are using it to laugh at and humiliate him?! not the look he was going for!), he will stop doing it - but he will test HARD and maybe for a while before stopping. He may try again in future. You must never react again the way you have been.

Also move him from his priveleged position at the center of your world in such a way as he feels it - you are not the center of his. I don't mean be unfaithful, I mean start to build a life that is aside from him. Friends and interests, otherwise he will completely destroy your self esteem and maybe also your sanity.

This is no way to live. I advocate getting out. But maybe when you come to see that he is doing this utterly on purpose, you will change your mind on that and leave him. Start to observe him. React differently (cluster B always has us RE-acting to them, start to notice this too). Through this, you will discover what he is.

"Everybody is going ""fuck that friend"" but as someone who works in hotels you did inconvenience him a lot.

Crashing in someone's room implies they've got a spot for you, if it's just the floor it should be mentioned.

If you hadn't surprised him and instead said ""hey I'm pretty sure I should be able to make it up this night after all."" He could have done a bunch of things:

1)get his own hotel room-which is inconvenient to do when you arrived because of the late hour and limited options (depending on how busy your hotel is, it's also potentially more expensive too.) Hell if hubby hadn't said you guys had space then he probably could have just gotten his own room.

2) could have requested a rollaway bed, which are often not reservable, in limited numbers, and are first come first serve.

3) gone and gotten an airmatress or sleeping bag. Which costs money and is probably easier to find when its not 1 in the morning.

I don't know if I would have literally just left but I'd be pretty annoyed if suddenly I didn't have a spot after getting one. Your 'surprise' was probably very cute for your husband but sometimes your actions can be inconvenient to others.

I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy and I would never be thrilled about another person's tragedy... As a woman who knows the crushing violation you can feel at things far less than that when it comes to your body and intimacy, she should have been nothing short of horrified. She was laughing??

You couldn't look Rochelle in the eye after knowing this... How can you look your girlfriend in the eye when you know that she is that vengeful and hateful. Don't marry her.

I am glad you're telling Rochelle and I sincerely hope you have an update soon about being single and courting Rochelle instead."
"If everything OP said about her fiancé's childhood is correct, his parents aren't passive. They're assholes. "
"You're doing the right thing. He's never really been an option. There are other great, compatible guys out there who are available. Let this guy go and focus on yourself for a while"
"Or a lot of people don't understand that the 8,000 sq ft house they lived in, multiple annual international vacations, and the fact that their parents were able to send all of their children to 4 year schools completely on their dime isn't really ""Upper middle class"", but ""upper class"" or 1%. 

You'd be surprised how many rich kids think they're ""upper middle class"" just because they aren't quite celebrity/billionaire rich levels, blissfully ignorant of the fact that they still have more than 99% of the country. 

Occupy Wall Street was going on around the time I went to college; I remember having a conversation with my floor mates and a few of them thinking ""No way!"", when I told them the income threshold for being ""1%"" in the US is in the mid 300s. They knew they had money; they just didn't know how good of a position they were in relative to most of the country. "
"His answer is emotional, yours is practical. 
You could try saying instead ""I would want to spend every possible dime on my puppy, but I don't think it would be fair or practical to spend everything and be homeless just so s/he could live for an extra six months. It seems more humane to end his suffering after a long and happy life"". 

Cuz I'm with you on this one. I love my dogs, but if they were older and I couldn't insure them, I could not justify spending 10k on surgeries just to add maybe a year of suffering on to their life. "
And now they can't go home for Christmas unless they're okay with missing OP's wedding. Or they have to help do last minute wedding stuff if they're bride maids. Merry Christmas...
"&gt;  It's ludicrous to suggest he needs to pussyfoot and coddle her about this. 

She's postpartum and sounds like she's struggling and stressed out her mind. It's mental to suggest that he needs to come down on her like a tonne of bricks.   "
"Do not drop this.  Get her to explain clearly and to your understanding.  If she tries just using emotions like ""it just is"" or ""why are you making a big deal about this"" or calls you names like in your post, these should be red flags.  Something is obviously going on that she doesn't want you to know about and is manipulating you into.  This would also be a good time to stand your ground and show her that this is a 2 way street and not a behind the back free for all."
"Yeah! That's what bothered me the most. The total double standard makes me think that the husband knows that it was inappropriate, even if it's just a little inkling at the back of his mind."
"I get that, and it makes sense but it might not be fully reasonable. She might feel like it bothers you because you feel like you are the only person entitled to her body and she might not like that. I know I would react negatively because it's my body, and if I am ok with being naked in my own home I don't want to be policed for that. How often do you see what your neighbors are doing from their windows? I find people are rarely looking as much as you think they are."
"If you were my niece, I would absolutely make sure you felt included in all the festivities of the day. How can she say she's concerned for you and wants you to be comfortable - she's worried you'll get jealous and of the psychological impact it may have, when she is knowingly excluding you and causing issues in the family over it.

Who in their right damn mind would invite parents, and every other child but one? A kid she claims to care about, but not enough to believe that she would be fine at the wedding and would have a good time without issue.

I'm sorry that your ""aunt"" is such a piece of shit. You and your brothers should plan to do something really awesome on the night of her wedding. Something memorable - something that will overshadow her bullshit. Make some great memories that night!"
"This is absolutely not a Russian thing, vice versa, there is a practice (I don't like it, but nevertheless) that parents support children well into their adulthood. So, quite the opposite. 

VERY bizarre idea, really. For a Russian one of the MOST BIZARRE ideas a parent can come up with. "

"I get that nicknames often have no correlation. I have a nickname for my nephew that has absolutely no connection to his real name. But he was 5 when I started that and fully knew his name was Robert, not what I call him. He thinks it's funny and ""scolds"" me and tells me that's not his name. Plus, if I'm out in public with him, I introduce him as Robert, not Beauregard. I'm not trying to tell people that's his actual name. What my husband is doing goes a bit beyond a ""nickname."" "
It's like someone took an emotional abuse checklist and wrote a paragraph example for each item on the list. 
"Because melanoma can quickly become something deadly, she's doing the right thing by speaking up.  I have a young relative who had stage II melanoma and she too is making sure others are aware of the dangers of too much sun exposure/tanning beds.  

Having lost several friends to skin cancer, she's not being dramatic.  The sad part with one of my friends was that a small original spot had been completely removed(hey, just a little skin surgery, right?) but they didn't get it all.  5 years later a spot on the lungs and then the devastating news that it was all over his brain and he had about 10 weeks of life left.    Nothing would have fixed it- chemo or radiation.  Because the cancer messed with his thinking, he looked and acted more like a dementia patient than a man dying of cancer, for he had all his hair and was at a healthy weight.

TL;DR cancer is serious stuff even if someone doesn't look like a typical cancer patient. She's not being dramatic. "
"Equity, not equality. "
"Oh I definitely see that happening. Unfortunately, she has to make the decision to leave and she isn't at that point yet. At the same time, I don't think it's fair to push that burden on to me. "
We have read it. Entering the building was inappropriate. It give the *appearance* that he is babysitting her.
"His reasons are bullshit. Don't even consider what kind of job you should get because it shouldn't be on the table. 

I believe this isn't an abusive situation - it's just that this sub sees a disproportionate amount of them. But even still, don't bend on this. Instead, use it as an opportunity to improve your communication as a couple and to tell your husband to get his head out of his ass. He may be stressed and/or anxious about his life changing now that he's married but you shouldn't have to deal with it this way. 

It's obvious you really love your job and he shouldn't be so bent on taking you away from something you love so much. "
"Your daughter has two children under five who don't sleep well, at least one is ""challenging"", they tantrum in public, and the two of them have a private, gibberish language (and the younger one doesn't speak 'properly' at all).

But you are 100% sure that they don't have any issues and the problem is all your lazy, lying daughter who embarrasses you socially?

Boy, I'm glad my mom is nothing at all like you."
It's like that guy in S1 of Fargo who wanted to blackmail the guy who found the money
Just tell them straight sit down with your mother or father or all of them and say how you would really like it if they attended one of your matches. Good luck.
"If he's at least a somewhat normal and well adjusted person, never."
"Just called him up. He said we would get the kids to give recorded responses to show a judge, and then get full custody. "
"The fact that you would say that your daughter and step daughter shoulder any blame in this situation speaks incredibly poorly of you. Your daughter is getting over the death of her mother at 11 years old. You were verbally abusive to your stepdaughter. 

It's good that you say that you've changed (though the way you are apportioning blame here makes me doubtful that that's the case), but your wife is right to put the security and happiness of her daughter first and her daughter doesn't feel safe around you. They don't owe you anything. If you have had good communication with your wife since the separation than she has had a chance to get a sense of whether or not you've changed to a sufficient degree, and has decided it's not enough.

Time to move on. If you've really changed, you'll be able to start fresh with a new family. If you actually care about your wife and stepdaughter, give them what they want and move on. 

I've been rather harsh here, so let me end on a gentler tone: Sometimes we fuck up and we can't fix it. It sucks. But we have to work on accepting it. It's not the end of the world. Focus on being there for your daughter for a little while."
I would lose my shit if my bf was hanging out with some girl in her underwear. You're not crazy.
You have to be a troll. Omg. There's no way you exist in the real world. 
This reminds me of a documentary called Trophy Kids.
Your post and many others make it clear that I was absolutely in the wrong.  I need to be more careful in the future.  Thank you for your thoughts.
"Never thought I would be a divorced man, but regardless if she is cheating or not, it is clear we are no longer happy. It will all be ok, there is always a positive outcome in every situation."
I love the part about her not even thinking of lending/giving her veil. 
"It has nothing to do with the touching, though. I would be so grossed out to see my sister in ""sex mode."" Like, giving a guy a blow job or having something done to her, or talking dirty to a guy. I feel grossed out if I overhear her having sex with her boyfriend, let alone actually watching her in a sexual act and me participating in any way. "
"So, here's the dirty little secret about monogamy, marriage, etc:  you are still a healthy sexual person (assuming you're not asexual) even after you promise fidelity to another for the rest of your life.  You're still going to be attracted to other people.  You might still indulge in pornography (even if strictly mental).  You are still going to have a type, even when you and your SO are old and wrinkly and can never attract that type even if single.  It's okay.  There's an extra caveat of removing yourself from real-life situations around people you find attractive.  Hot new co-worker? Keep in strictly professional, do not become friends.  Hot person a regular in a place you frequent?  Find another place/another time to go.  A friend starts to look appealing? Distance, distance, distance.  The key to fidelity isn't never being tempted, but to say no to temptation every single time.  You aren't doing anything wrong by fantasizing about the cop who pulled you over.  Unless you start flirting or trying to give him your phone number."
"Since you have made your decision, stay with your boyfriend's family until you have had the abortion. Then tell your mother that you miscarried. Do not tell anyone else. After it's all over your mother will eventually forgive you.

Talk to your doctor about an IUD."
"I was cheated on. It was weird because he was lying. If he was a good liar, it wouldn't have been weird. I'm sorry."
"Definitely this. What if she has to come back and live there as a part of their custom? She seems to follow her family's customs to the letter, so I wouldn't be surprised if OP and his princess had to move/take over something/do some sort of wedding ritual."
"Yeah, that's what makes you bad news for her. You don't want to be a better person for yourself, you just want to appear less abusive to your gf so that she won't leave. "
"Normally, I'd agree with you--the deceased probably had a good reason for setting up inheritance they way they did.  However, in the case of a man being intentionally hurtful to his family (and doing so based on hatefulness and bigotry), he doesn't deserve to be honored in this manner.  Spread the inheritance fairly to end his legacy of exclusion and spite."
"Honestly, that's what I thought when she mentioned the massage."
"Pawn brokers give very little in relation to a rings retail value. Take the receipt and redeem the ring now, save it for the next girl."
"If it turned out that he was sterile, how would you feel about him?  Would you assign blame?  You're not responsible for something that is completely out of your control.  You are both in this together as a couple.  You have to sit down and talk through how to move on together through this.  I would take a good hard look at your husband's behaviour before thinking of next steps toward having children."
"Isn't a third just scraping a pass? I never knew anyone that got one, but doesn't it go first, upper second, lower second, third/pass?

Either way, bit weird for OP to act like they're all jealous of how easily he gets by with a third... Most coasters I knew could manage a 2.2 or 2.1 at least."
"&gt;How so? It's misguided and scary to think that a women I love has been corrupted because she cheats and plays guys? I'm trying to see it from your perspective, but I don't see how as of now.

How is this corrupted? 

You've pointed to ways in which she's been promiscuous, or has not been faithful in her relationships. People deal with this every day. 

It's disturbing to think that you find her to be damaged or corrupted simply because she's been intimate with other men. 

And may I remind you, regardless of your BMI or your relationship statuses ... YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS WOMAN.

"Your boyfriend made the right move, I probably would have beat the old man further but whatever. I say that instead of dump your boyfriend you dump your family, especially your bratty sister."
"Reassure your wife that you're on her team. Put SIL on limited profile. Tell your bro that you think it's best if you only meet up either with just you two or with both wives, and that if you turn up expecting just him and his wife is there, then you will have to leave out of loyalty to your wife. Then agree to simply not discuss it at all-as it's his wife pumping him for information this won't really affect you."
"You came here for absolution and I am pretty sure you will not find it. You have no right to try and force a poly relationship on an unwilling partner, it makes you a bad person. You should break up with him if you can't participate in a relationship that is healthy and fulfilling for the both of you. Also your reasons for not leaving him are bullshit. "
"&gt;Plays the victim card and it will straight-up make me vivid. 

This is a total aside and I'm usually not a grammar Nazi but the word you want is ""livid"" not vivid."
But her cousin wanted the doll.
"My mom's horrible tattoos didn't stop me...but it did teach me to put some thought into what I want on my body for the rest of my life. Same with my sister. 

My mom tattooed the name of the first guy she slept with after divorcing my dad. Super classy..."
"Haha, everyone was downvoting you in that other post and it turns out your roommate really is crazy.  Good riddance!"
Just tagging on here. She posted this already like 17 hours ago and was told pretty much what you said in your post. 
Him whining at her until she gives him a hand or blowjob because she won't consent to vaginal sex is equally disgusting and is *still* coercive.
"I'm not sure I understand. If someone wants to be friends with you, why should she invite another friend along? She already told you she had a boyfriend to indicate nothing romantic was happening, so why shouldn't she hang out with you one on one?"
Somehow I think that OP wouldn't enjoy getting an STD right now.
"I don't think that's a big deal at all, it's actually normal in my eyes."
"Then you get to do that now. Talk to him. Tell him to get therapy. Remind him that his wife lives on in her children, and she deserves to be remembered &amp; honored.

Then talk to your niece. Because if no one will, she's going to assume it's some big, huge, unforgivable secret about her mother being a terrible person. Your deceased sister-in-law deserves better than that."
Five months? Boy bye. 
"Uh yeah, it's pretty obvious that Daddy Warbucks over there has plenty of issues with women that not only is a young one not enough, she has to be foreign of the submissive variety as well. I think he is playing dumb and is well aware of exactly what the situation looks like but wants to somehow be the victim. To random internet people, to his siblings, to people who ""question"" this marriage. There is no way he doesn't see this exactly as everyone else does. 

Apparently he was never married before since this is the first time his siblings were confronted with this possibility. You don't make it to 53, single, and wealthy without getting some warped ideas about what your wife should be... particularly if what you come up with when you finally make that decision is a 22 year old you've known for 2 months."
"All your comments are super defeatist. Talk to your school!

A girl the year ahead of me in college was 2 weeks away from handing in her final year project (60 minute radio documentary), what do you know, her computer crashed and she hadn't backed up any of the audio.

The school gave her an extension on her work and she was able to hand it in a week or so later, they  managed to find files but they were mostly 'reject' files, she managed to make it work and they took it into account with their grading.

A week after that happened, she was crossing the street and a car speeding and breaking the red light knocked her over and she fucked up her arm which made using the mouse more difficult, the school gave her another extension for that.

No matter how scary and strict 'authorities' seem, they understand that *things happen* and have guides in place for when they do.

Do not be defeatist or give up hope until you have explored all avenues."
"Honestly, it depends on you. Me and my husband make a lot of jokes that are borderline offensive with each other about gender roles but it's always joking and never in a fighting or serious way. As long as he shows you respect and stuff in your actual relationship and would stop if you asked, i dont see a problem. Maybe ask him to tone it down around your friends though because, while they may have your best interests at heart, sometimes these types of things are hard to interpret from the outside. "
"&gt; I have personal belief in marriage and went into this with the thought that divorce is not an option.

The thing is, your husband doesn't have that thought.  He doesn't live in that world.  So to him, if you say stuff like ""divorce is not an option"", you might as well be saying ""I don't mind the prostitutes, knock yourself out.""  

"
"Okay I was a child in the middle of a huge legal battle. My dad spend his whole life savings on lawyers, doctors, the whole 9 yards, I think in the end he ended dropping over 20k. But moving on, why do you even give a shit about what your ex thinks? Dude your battling this woman in court, I know what types of crazy they can get in court why does her words or accusations even bother you? Her words should be water on a ducks back man. You said it yourself ""my kids are my world"" so focus on your kids and anything your ex says just ignore it. Easier said than done but you do not need to let her bullshit drag you down. 

If you want some advice on how to help your kids through this feel free to drop me a message. I was going through the whole legal battles for a good 7 years with my dad. I can relate to things like this. "
"I feel like everything related to woman's reproductive parts is SO taboo that half the world doesn't even know what's normal. 

This whole convo is making me a bit queasy (picked a dumb time to eat), but I know I have found the most random little hairs basically inside me or REEEEEALLY close to inside me. I once realized one was clearly a hair from my cat. I couldn't even look at him in the eyes for days."
"I've never dealt with this level of betrayal, so I won't claim to know what it's like. With that said, I think you should be upfront with your bosses. Let them know about your history, and concerns. 

I know your worried about making it personal, but the fact is you've already kind of made it personal. Your claiming that the people involved in a very ""expensive"" upgrade are untrustworthy. 

I don't know your relationship with your bosses, but it seems like they're going to want some kind of explanation. You can stonewall them of course, and not share your past history with them but I don't think that is going to strengthen your case.

You made the choice to question the integrity of the software team, your bosses are going to want to know why. So give them a reason, and let them know about your concerns. You might be accused of being biased, but at least you can't be accused of hiding the facts. "
Hire a lawyer to do up a will while your mom can still sign off on it as a competent person. And I guess before your sister is able to spend more time grooming your mom.
"Hah, don't worry, my friends and I brag enough for ourselves. We're pretty damn proud of our bar. We have t-shirts. Daniel has a tattoo of our logo. Our bar is our collective baby. We have pictures on our phone, we brag about it, we tell other bar owners our bar is better than theirs. 

As for asking me to give up other things, he's never done it. Like I said, in the beginning our relationship he voiced concerns about me working in a sketchy bar, but ultimately never said anything else about it. And honestly, when he asked me to stop working there, it didn't seem to come from a place of control so much as a place of concern. 

I'm not saying he's right to ask me to quit, because I don't really think he is. And I think it is a bit controlling. But truthfully I don't think he means it to be. He had never tried to control me before, so it just seems a bit odd. He's not an angry man, he doesn't yell or get passive aggressive or anything. So it's all a bit weird. "
Perhaps she's thinking that she'd rather be dead than go through the loss of a child.
"Oh gawd. I've been with my SO for six months. He has two kids 3 &amp;amp;amp; 6. I haven't met them at all. Not even in a group setting as a ""friend."" It's not on the table for another 6-18 months even though we're madly in love and see potential for a future. Why? 

BECAUSE MY BOYFRIEND WANTS TO KEEP HIS KIDS SAFE FROM ANY FURTHER HARM!! They're 3 &amp;amp;amp; 6!! They have a mom. I will NEVER be their mom, even if I marry him. I will be lucky if I get to earn the title of ""step-mom.""  The last thing they need is strange women in and out of their lives. Dating is hard. But that instability is WAY harder on kids. WAY harder. It's such a huge red flag that she's not willing to protect her child in the same way. You should not even have met the child at this point, much less be living with him. If my boyfriend had even asked me to do so much as meet his kids already, I would be gone. I don't tolerate an SO who won't put their kids first. Sure it means I see him less because I never see him on his kid nights, but seriously his kids DESERVE that kind of protection and respect. And they deserve one on one attention from their actual parent without some me strange lady involved. 

OP this is about 7 million red flags. Get out now!!"
Tell your mother Don't bring Germany into this shit!!
"Agreed. Risking exposure of this potential hazard is like walking along a river infested with alligators. Keep your children safe. She obviously doesn't care, and it doesn't sound like she has for a long time."
They share responsibility for going to bed together. The potential fallout to his career is on him alone. She is not responsible for whether or not his decision to sleep with her stops him getting tenure.
"An upvote is not enough. I really really want her to see this. It's not just his behavior, it's his character that's in question. "
"I admit that at first I would probably be smug about seeing Rochelle on the net if I was Sherry, but it doesn't take more than a few seconds to think ""Wait, what if this was **me**?""

I would have ended up telling Rochelle about it myself and never showing the PORNO to my SO who already said he had a crush on her.  He pictured having sex with her, why would I actually show him a video of her having sex?

Anywho.  Girlfriend: not a healthy mindset at all.  I get the slight feeling of victory seeing the ""enemy"" suffer, but a human conscience should still be in there to rectify the situation rather than parade it to your SO smugly. Not. Cool."
"Doesn't mean he's going to perv on his daughter ffs. I still like to check out women, doesn't mean I find my own daughter hot"
You cant hurt a dead mans feelings.
"Your mother and your situation growing up sounds eerily similar to mine, except it was a trip to my grandparent's house that I never came back from as my father was also a drug addict/dealer.  Honestly, I think you've made a big mistake by thinking that your kids should have her in their life.  What happens if she does go back to drinking or using drugs and then your kids will want to know what happened to grandma?  You've already let her into your life once again, what makes you think you won't keep letting her back in every time she messes up and then gets clean?  Your kids are just going to see dysfunctional, messed up grandma coming in and out of their lives and letting them down.  Statistically speaking, your mother has a very high chance of relapsing back into her old ways.  

""Closure"" is a myth.  It is just another way of letting toxic people back into your life in situations like this.  If the things your mother did seem like they happened ages ago, to some one else, or like she's a stranger to you, then there's your closure.  The things my mother did to me don't bother me anymore, and I don't have any strong feelings towards her either way, as if she were a stranger, because I've moved on.  If you're ever able to get to that point, that's your closure."
You're not manipulative. This guy refuses to enforce healthy boundaries. Enforcing your own personal boundaries is not manipulative. 
"I'm not sure this actually makes the situation any different though. Anybody tells me my cats aren't cute or annoy them and I guess they're not invited round to the house any more. 

You can't tell someone their beloved family member is annoying - especially not for no reason at all. 

Of course here it's an even greater rejection because of what the dog helped OP through, but even without that the bf can fuck right off. "
"&gt; Marrying and having kids way too young 

Not only that, but he had the years from 19-24 to do the partying, dating, drinking, etc, get it out of his system.  She never got those experiences, and now it sounds like she regrets it.  OP, you may have to cut your losses, it sounds like having freedom to do whatever she wants is more of a priority to her than you."
Why on earth would you stay?  
"&gt; there's no man's role or woman's role in either of our relationships.

I honestly think this is kind of a super power of gay relationships. OP, your dad has picked some outdated/disrespectful ""guy stuff"" to let you back in on, but I think you've handled it well. You joined in on fishing because you like it, and did *not* join in on shirking clean-up, because you do not like that gendered expectation. Keep doing what you're doing, and make sure to invite your boyfriend along if he'd be interested in some of the ""guy stuff,"" and ask your mother and sisters if you can join the ""woman stuff"" when you'd like to."
"He has some self entitled issues as far as I am concerned. Who the hell is he to tell you what job or lifestyle you should have? You are already trying to move your life forward, and are planning for events such as having kids. Your husband seems to have his own ***agenda***."
"""I remember when I told her that I applied for the position that she really wanted and applied for"" he didn't leave it out"
"My biggest concern here is that I'm not seeing any signs whatsoever that he has demonstrated he cares about you feel about this, while you've offered a lot of compromises and you talk about he cares about your feelings a lot. Have you seen any signs of this, OP? 

I think the fact that you actually go by your last name in your daily life and casual conversation makes your position much more reasonable, but that's a secondary point. "
"There are consequences to every action.

One day he might slam a pan down, no victim. But what happens they day he slams something or throws something and it hits an innocent little boy just from proximity?

Gamers rage, short fuse, little patience it is all the same thing. Being violent to objects could and probably will hurt someone nearby.

Your husband needs to get himself in check, or you wreck him with a divorce. There are little children in his home, how would a sleepover with his best friends go?"
"As for gaming, ""Thank you, but I understand the rules quite well."" Or, ""You should know I know the rules because I won this game last time."""
"In Spain's Spanish we have ""te quiero"" (""I want you"") which is something you can say to express any kind of love, ""te quiero mucho"" (""I want you a lot"") which is something you say to family or friends but not romantic, and ""te amo"" (""I love you"") for romantic love. But as far as I know in other Spanish speaking countries like Mexico ""te amo"" can be used as a superlative of ""te quiero"". My Mexican friend says ""lo amo"" (""I love him"") about her son all the time, and it sounds super weird to me."
"Your seem to be blaming some of the money problems on your wife (she spends money, she isn't bringing in an income).  But you both, together, purchased a house that you really couldn't afford.  You borrowed as much as you could and used up all of your savings to buy your house, leaving no savings cushion.  You are house poor.  And that's a decision the two of you made together.

You already hate your job.  Start putting out resumes.  Use your experience to try to get a better job that pays more.

And stop thinking of yourself as frugal and your wife the spender when you both signed on for that large mortgage.  It isn't good for your relationship that you're blaming her for buying decorations when the mortgage is what's killing your finances."
"Since you're in a committed relationship, you can bring it up during a non-sexy time.
&gt;right when we wake up in the morning.

You may have to either grin and bear it or give up that super-spontaneous morning sex. I actually don't like to really kiss people until I've brushed my teeth, but there have been a few mornings I made exceptions. Maybe you could get some clean-scented massage oil or flavored lube and incorporate manual foreplay with it on days she hasn't showered? Or you could also just make a sexy clean-up part of your routine. It can be pretty fun to lather someone up."
"I've been on this sub a while, and there have been so many women who posted about boyfriends who would say they had too much makeup on and try to control their appearance. Never once did it go well or not end up escalating.
What you wear and how you take care of your appearance is YOURS. Own it and do what you love. Don't let someone change you or make you feel you should change for them."
"I would second this to add that you should fully explain the whole story so that they understand the urgency. If your parents can help, so much the better. "
"I guess so, yes. But sometimes *I* like to lighten the mood. It doesn't have to be serious, and it's not me trying to turn him off or get out of sex. Laughter while having sex is a beautiful thing. I understand he doesn't get that.. But I've explained to him that it's not be 'turning him down'. Do you always approach sex head on, in only a serious way? I'm not understanding. "
"He should have been honest about the sex 6 damn weeks ago when he knew it happened. He might have stood a chance had he been honest but he wasn't he lied. So, the next questions are this..has this group done this to anyone else in the friends circle and has he helped? Why did he lie to her? If he's so innocent why lie? People have been dumped for lesser reasons and it's her life he's screwed up."
"Wow. You fucked up, big time. You need to pay for her to either get it fixed or to get extensions (could be several thousand dollars, plus a few hundred every other month for maintenance--if that sounds like a lot to you, think about how she must be feeling, facing that kind of expense through no fault of her own). I would also take a long, hard look at your relationship with alcohol. Sounds like you need to reevaluate your drinking."
"I like your thinking. To be fair it wouldn't get to that point for me. The second he'd said I was too loose for him to come I think I'd have responded 'Oh honey, it's not my vaginas fault that your dick is too small to touch the sides', and then dumped him."
You need to talk to him about this before you go off on him about it. It's not impossible that he's taking nudes for himself or for you or because he was bored. He'd be far from the first person to do that without having evil ulterior motives. 
"Seems you're being a *little* pedantic with the exact wording, but I believe the idea of that commenter would be better stated as ""old school guy who doesn't want to have too much *paid for him*""... just think of it that way.

Because, there are a lot of guys who would take every opportunity for the ""free upgrade"" on their vacation, their dinners out, their first home w someone, etc. without a second thought.

You don't wanna be that guy, I think the that's a fine stance. And she might too (I trust your instinct on that).

But you're probably gonna need to let that go for some things in the relationship, if you wanna keep this rich girl long-term. And a European vacation is the perfect example of a ""treat"" that you can let the partner do at the level she likes/can afford without letting it affect your dynamic.

And I would go even further, and say to let her pay *for the whole damn trip*. Because if you try to measure out some part or aspect of the trip to do at your budget (hotels at her level, meals at your level), your penny-pinching could jump into her face daily and screw with the comfort-level she's trying to establish.

Instead, save your part and tell her *you're* going to pay for a different ""whole damn trip"".

Then plan and execute some vacation to place(s) / activities that she might not have thought of. *Your* contribution will come out in the research, interesting ideas, planning, etc...

Just a couple of examples: 

--Camping. But only do this if you are a pretty experienced camper and she does not detest camping.... (Test the dynamic out on a relatively small trip-- a single-overnight or a weekend, before plunging into bigger camping ideas).

If she can be just-comfortable-enough to forget about the hotel-suite jacuzzi she's missing, then you can ""wow"" her with Nature-- something like that's impossible to pay for....

And there's your ""equality"" right there.

--Asia. Thailand is relatively cheap still, Vietnam is ridiculously cheap.

--Peru. The famous ""Inca Trail"" may be within your budget, you just have to book it a year or more in advance. Read up on your Inca history to make this something *you* showed*her*...

Totally priceless.

PM me for an even cheaper alternative in Peru... you can pretty much go Glamping with hired mules/driver/guide/chef for $50 / day...

--Drive around Nova Scotia, new Zealand, or Scotland itself. Plenty of ""quaint"" bed-and-breakfast type accommodation where the lack of luxury is *part of* the charm."
"I vote typo, it would be a really strange thing to say even if it were true."
Yup. I feel her. A bedroom he's never used with his ex. 
"The car is in my parents name. She does not own a car but she uses the ""family car"" that my other sisters and I have shared since high school."
"We need /u/shittywatercolor to paint a picture of OP as a flannel-clad lumberjack wielding an enormous axe, while her husband lies seductively at her feet."
"I had to borrow money from my daughter's piggybank for some food to hold us over the weekend. Paid her back with a bit of interest as a ""thank you"", and now she wants to lend me money all the time."
"The man you married lied about who he was for 3 years to get you to marry him.  This is not the first time I've seen this.  Now that he's ""got you"" he just figures now he can be the real him since you're legally bound.

Yeah he may have depression but as someone that has had severe depression he just sounds like a lazy POS.  Talk to him about possible depression but I really think my first hunch is right.  If he denies the depression and won't get help I'd gtfo."
"Don't meet up with him, you've completely lost respect for him and it won't work out well for either of you. His current situation is  called Karma. Sometimes she gets it right"
"1. Temporarily switch bedrooms. You don't need a big room to sleep in, and sometimes sleep is easier in a small room dedicated to just the bed. 

2. Get a white noise generator and slowly phase out the TV. The sound is more even and less anxiety provoking. Flickering lights are not good for your sleep.

3. Install a lock on the bedroom door. Silly but cheap, and may bring you some psychological comfort. 

4. Treat your anxiety. This sounds more serious than just isolated sleep issues.

5. Try being awake and alone (away from sleeping partner) in your house. Stay up until the quit wee hours (2 am at least). Turn the lights off. Relax. Walk around outside in the dark. Drink a glass of wine. Feel in charge of your night environment.

6. Turn off all sounds in for an hour or so and allow yourself to listened to the night.

7. Treat your anxiety! "
Do you need to be in contact with your parents at all? Because you don't have to be.
"you shouldn't be in a relationship right now because, judging from other comments, you are actively suicidal. YOU MUST GET TREATMENT. If you haven't been in treatment since you were a teenager, you need more."
I honestly don't think you can fix this. The reason she doesn't want any of your suggestions (counseling etc.) is because your gut reaction was to distrust your wife instead of looking up whether red hair can be passed on by people who don't have it. Why would she go back to someone that deep down doesn't really trust her?
"Employers, friends, family, colleagues, colleges, potential partners and their family are all people that their opinion should concern you."
"If you're honestly asking, it's because you come across as incredibly critical and judgmental. There's a nice way to say the message in your edit and a very harsh way. "
"&gt; Reading over this, I am probably making something out of nothing

NO, you have cause for concern. He's obviously up to something that he doesn't want you to see.
"
"Man....

This dude is hella intent on worming his way into your house!

Danger! Danger! Danger! Lol

Once he gets his ass in your place good luck removing him. He is either into you, or has some sense of squatting or both. 

Probably both."
Maybe try calling some of her friends and explaining you're going to go to the police if you can't find her 
A good person doesn't move in an unemployed stranger when she has a child to support. A good person gets her life together and doesn't string her kid and now a partner along through the shitshow that is this school/job roulette. She is WAY too old for this embarrassment. 
"You have to tell your wife. Period. 

I find it hard to believe that this ""just happened"", completely sober and all. 

Grace needs to be 100% gone from your life. "
That front seat thing struck a nerve with me. He's literally putting her first. Pisses me off. No more girl. Put your foot down.
"Eh, but would you have carried that secret to the point of going ahead with buying a house?"
"I'm going to be a jerk and suggest that your girlfriend is being hit on in front of you a lot less than you actually think she is. 

You give three examples in this post: Church Guy, Dog-Park Guy, and Grocery Guy. Church Guy seems like your typical Christian dude with no ill intent. Bible study is a common form of outreach to new members. Women, statistically speaking, are the ones who determine whether a couple/family remains religious. It wasn't weird for him to give her his number in that context. 

Grocery Guy had no way of knowing your gf was in a relationship. You weren't with her when he was hitting on her. Unless you're suggesting that he stalked the pair of you through the aisles and finally, when you turned your back, he jumped at the opportunity. 

Dog-Park Guy was pretty sketchy. But, I gotta say, not that sketchy, since you don't imply that he continued to harass your gf after that one comment. 

Heck, I'll give the waiters and bartenders a pass too, while we're at it. Do they know that you're in a committed long-term relationship? Nope. For all they know, she could be on a shitty blind date with some dude. 

You're probably thinking right now that I'm naive. Maybe. But if you trust your girlfriend and her coping strategies, what's wrong with thinking the best of other people? Until she asks you to intervene, assume that she has the situation under control, and there's nothing you can do to help her. 

And, uh, maybe spend some time unpacking the whole idea of 'respect'. Respect of whom? Hitting on a woman isn't inherently disrespectful. Hitting on her when your relationship status is unclear isn't disrespectful either. Sure, you're being disrespected by a minority of dudes, but keep in mind how small that number actually is."
"8 months of dating, he has Chlamydia, and he wants to move in with you?  Hell no!

Don't have this guy move in with you."
"Healthy would be talking your dry spell through and then spicing things up.  Healthy would be... you know, communication. Not emotional cheating, dismissal and then avoidance. 

OP has every right to feel hurt. "
"And then he stayed for three years, op must be a master-level deceiver"
"&gt; Mom probably can

Mom probably can't commit to this, or risk missing the birth entirely. Due dates are not set in stone. "
"He is suffering. He is 47, he is dying. His happily married brother hasn't spoken to him in years and years. He fucked up big time, but I guess you can say he has paid the price.

Once he is dead there will be no second chances, no one last time to talk and get it all out. Now is the time.  Just think in decades to come, will you regret not allowing him to make amends? Will this be a regret? 

Some people say forgiveness really benefits the person doing the forgiving more than the forgiven. I don't know how that 100% works, but I think in forgiving we let go of past hurts that have held us back and allows us to move forward.

I wish you all the best OP, I hope it works out well for you and that whatever you choose to do it brings you some peace.

"
"I actually almost said ""Do your laundry beforehand! If you have heavy bleeding and feel worn out and nauseous, suddenly need to change ..well, it's a bad time to find out you're on your last clean pair of underwear.""
 Then i decided I sounded too much like a mom and a 20 something college student probably doesn't need an internet auntie, lol."
"""The kind that loves you and knows that most of the work will fall to her, like the puppy you always told your mum you wanted but never ended up looking after?""

In some ways I think women often have a clearer idea of what raising children will be like, and so it's sometimes easier for them to decide ""No thank you"". OP, it seems like you've decided this.

Your fiancé has not. This is a basic incompatibility. It doesn't make either of you bad people. It just means you want different things out of life, and should search for more compatible partners. Don't torture either of you by dragging this out longer than you have to - it'll just compound the pain for both of you. "
"Thank you.  I'm always surprised by how common the misconception is that ""I don't want something about me printed - must be slander.""

An alternative cause of action might be appropriation of one's likeness for commercial purposes/right of publicity.  Still won't get OP a gag order, obviously, because pretty much nothing would.  But... I can't remember now if you need to actually be famous for that one to work.

Good think I'm not taking the bar next week or anything..."
It's a pretty common tactic for a cheater to lie and try to make the person they cheated with look worse than them. He wanted you to hate her instead of him.
"Think of it as a military operation:

Hope for the best, plan for the worst.

And watch your six."
"&gt; after a few min that I really fainted but he first thought I was faking it so he was ignoring me

What? His SO slumps to the ground as he's sitting there watching TV, and he can't be bothered to check if she has a pulse? I'd go all HR on his ass; formal reprimand; must agree to an improvement trajectory over the next 3 months; if no improvement: termination."
"What the fuck is wrong with you? Your friend is being abused and you refuse to do something because you are ""afraid of drama""??? Honestly, have you ever considered growing a pair and actually standing up for something?

Thank god I have better friends than you."
"AND he can't even admit that it was a shitty thing to do, again deflecting personal responsibility (I lied in a way that really hurt you) in attempt to make her again feel like the problem (you're being to sensitive)... This alone shows his behavior is unlikely to change, even though the truth about that one issue eventually came out."
"You're not a match for the simple reason that you are hesitant. It's not only medical reasons that disqualify transplants. There doesn't need to be medical proof. 

And as an ICU nurse that works with transplants, I'm glad they aren't letting him get a donor kidney. I hate seeing organs go to waste and he clearly doesn't fit the recipient criteria. Not saying in any way that I'm glad he'll die from kidney disease, don't misunderstand. But there are so many people out there who are in desperate need of organs, and it's not appropriate to give an organ to someone who will treat it like the one they fucked up in the first place. "
"This. I didn't feel that bond with my second child until he started smiling, either."
"Im tanned and a man, 2 out of 3 ain't bad right?"
"I'm so sorry this happened to you, but I highly doubt this is the first time it's happened. Maybe it is the first time the cheating became physical, but I would bet it's not the first time him and this ""friend"" have been inappropriate "
"That's an awfully passive aggressive response.  You didn't mention any of those things in the post, so how was I supposed to judge you on them?  You explicitly said in your second paragraph that you were enjoying spending money on yourself, and the only reason she gets to enjoy most of it is because she's with you at the time.  You admitted that it sounded selfish, so I was just agreeing that yeah, it's a little selfish.  

If you think someone calling you ""not completely awesome"" is an attack, when you're explicitly asking for opinions on your relationship dynamic, I don't know what to tell you.  I regret saying it, since that's apparently the only thing you took away from my post."
"She's lucky a ""loose seal"" didn't bite off her hand. "
"This is what I fade towards. Bringing food in is *always* a bonus. All of my coworkers and I have experienced free food being brought in by another that was displeasing to us. Who cares. Bring the cherry pie in now and next time have a fun experiment with vegan cooking.

The most polite thing you can put is a ""Not Vegan"" note around it."
"Yeah, there's no way anyone could miss the writing on that wall.

Seriously *fucked up* and downright deadly intentions on their part."
"&gt;do you have access to the grocery delivery website?

I dunno, but something gives me the sinking feeling that OP's boyfriend is possessive of the grocery delivery routine at best, or keeping the website information from her at worst. Or that he will start to do this if she tries to change the delivery times. "

"Act like you don't give a shit any more. If people can see this still bothers you, they'll keeping bringing it up and asking questions. They like the drama so take that away from them. Answer questions with short, factual responses. Don't pretend you weren't angry or that it didn't happen, everyone knows, but act like you've gotten over it. ""Yeah, Jess decided to go with Joe instead of me at the last minute. I was pissed off, but its been a couple months."" "
She needs to see a doctor for a PPD eval.
"One trip a month seems pretty reasonable. Normally I'd say let it go, but you already don't have trust in your marriage and he doesn't seem like he's given you a lot of reassurance.

Why did you marry someone you don't trust? I'd suggest counseling to talk through your trust issues and move forward in the relationship. "
"That's actually not true. If you unfollow/unfriend a person, you can still see their comments on mutual friends' or public posts. But if you block them, you will only be able to see their past comments on your page (with the hyperlink on their name removed)--but you will not be able to see any new comments anywhere, on your or any mutual friends' or public posts."
I'm starting to think that's exactly what is happening. 
"Has she demonstrated odd behaviour before? I find it hard to believe this scenario is unique, especially if you agree she needs to get a grip...."
"Wow, like everyone else is saying, the wedding is not even worth talking about because your boyfriend is clearly a controlling, hypocritical, insensitive dickhead. 

1. Won't let you into his car, will let others
2. Blames you for something totally out of your control
3. Has an awful, dysfunctional family
4. Is controlling and has forbid you from **an entire section of town**
5. Is a hypocrite and goes there anyways
6. Is a liar 

Did I forget anything!?!

Break up with him and then no one will give you shit for not going to the wedding.

The fact that your boyfriend **ISN'T** what this post is about, tells me that you unfortunately think that any/all of his behavior is normal or OK.....it fucking isn't, and it makes me sad that for whatever reason you don't see that...please do yourself a huge favor and ditch this dude. It will be NO PROBLEM to get into a better relationship then this."

"The 40k is community property, not something which ""belonged to HIM."" She was completely in the wrong to spend it like she did, but it's community property. "
I've seen this video. I would talk to your husband now.
You aren't in love with this woman - you are just infatuated with a crush.  You barely know her as a romantic partner.  
"Right, she can't expect him to be honest when she makes him feel so guilty he doesn't feel like he *should* be honest. She sounds a bit co-dependent. She doesn't get to refuse to pay for data but also refuse to let him play alone, that's not fair. If she can't keep up, she doesn't go unless he invites her, or she can play on her own. End of story."
"You need to come up with a plan. Step 1 should be contact a lawyer. Step 2 should be do whatever they advise. Divorce is a relatively easy procedure if both parties agree to it, and considering the circumstances you describe it sounds like she is checked out of the marriage completely and will likely agree to the divorce immediately when presented with the papers to sign.

Also, you really should eliminate your brother from your life - he is obviously a scumbag for fucking your wife. Really if you can, you should make sure whatever mutual family you have are aware of what is going on (after you initiate the divorce) so they know not to ever trust him in the future. Fucking your brothers wife is about as low as a man can get, he deserves to be despised by your family.

One more thing: Please get yourself to a therapist ASAP. This is some really traumatic shit you are dealing with, you need an ally who will listen to you and help you process the pain of this betrayal. "
