"Call CPS, like, 3 years ago.

That's disgusting she'd do that."
He was 24 when we met not 16. He had 24 years to experience things. He also could have realized it sooner rather than waiting 7 years. 
"The weird voices and sudden agression do though. It sounds like manic behavior. Obviously, we don't know enough to make a fair assumption either way, but it should be considered at least a little bit as a possibility if this type of behaviour is out of the norm. "
"Goodness... That actually sounds rather likely, except for: why did the mother allow her to go to public school after years of refusal? (Though I suppose she might be sure it's been too long for anyone to recognize her) :s"
"Thirded! Getting to know your sexual self on your own will do wonders for your future intimate endeavours with others. You'll be able to tell them how to rub you the right way, so to speak.

Edit: rub, not run."
"You may or may not be a father in 5 months. It has nothing to do with your relationship. Move on emotionally and don't put your life on hold. Your relationship with your wife is completely over. Having a child doesn't change that. What you need to do now is talk to your lawyer about what you want to do if the child is yours. How much custody you want, what a fair amount for child support would be, et cetera.

Something to definitely talk about would be making sure she doesn't disappear back to Brazil with your child and never come back."
Karate chop her left titty and tell her too bad.
"My Indian fianc√©'s family have done something to make him break off the engagement with no contact except an email. It's very hard and I don't want to go into the details (especially because I've had no concrete answers for a week and a half while I hope he's safe and comes to his senses). We've been together 4 1/2 years and got engaged in June. 

One of the things in the email was I truly gave him the best years of his life. We're in our 30s. That's too young to give up on having amazing years. 

Please do not break it off for reasons other than it's no longer a healthy thing for you. If you truly love him, and you're prepared to be by his side despite what you listed, then stay. "
"&gt;When my dad started getting worse and I was at home taking care of him more, Jason started drinking more because the situation was stressful for him.

That was your first clue as to his behavior.  You are dealing with a dying father and Jason is stressed out while just watching.  How will he deal with the stress and problems we all have in the game of life?"
"&gt; It makes me wonder if she has a job or she just sees OP as a meal ticket and new daddy for the kids.

The first part of your comment was spot on, but this assumption is really unfair."
"Try therapy if you think you have deeper self destructive issues than just ""[you're] a pos"" but please LEAVE ANNIE ALONE. 

Let her heal, move on, and find someone worthy of her. You described her as an amazing person and she deserves someone who truly sees that and appreciates that in her /for/ her. 

You only seem to acknowledge her traits in the way that they serve your self esteem. That isn't okay and it's not fair to Annie. "
"As someone reading these responses and facepalming, thank you for understanding the culture in countries with military conscription, especially in nations which are plagued by conflict. 

This is out of Reddits sphere of knowledge and experience for the most part."
I feel like I've seen this exact same post before too 
"Which is why it depends entirely on what exactly she was was wearing and where they were going. So you can't really call her immature at all, and likening it to a kid who doesn't want to dress up for a wedding is not fair at all."
"ya that's exactly how you do it. you straight up say you need a change, shit is going down hill. how could he fix this if he has no idea it needs fixing. all unless maybe your tapped out yourself. I unddrstand what your saying though. you guys just need to get excited about something together again. my SO parents just had their 40th anniversary. what I noticed about them is they still date like their 18. going out to eat, takes vacation every few months. small road trips and shit. they keep their relationship constantly moving forward. I think that's the secret"
"&gt;She told me she didn't get her engagement when she wanted so that she needs this.

So, since she didn't get an engagement, she wants to sleep with other guys?  I'm curious what math classes she's been taking because this doesn't add up at all.  

&gt;She has also, thanks to my prying, admitted to that she has a friend in mind that she wants to sleep with

There it is.  

You should not open your relationship unless you are both 100% on-board with it.  Same with getting engaged.  If she can't deal with how things are, not engaged, but exclusive, then you should seriously consider breaking up.  It sounds like you may just want different things right now--although I'm not sure she knows what she wants. "
It's also possible that she hadn't gotten her citizenship yet and her greencard was based on them being married.  She could have had to leave because they were getting divorced.  And then what you said about them having to fly back and forth.
"You say a lot about minutiae of your fights here but you seem to be missing the big picture.  You don't work as a couple.  It's been 10 years and you can't talk to him about things that upset you.  He's nursing old wounds from old fights and apparently still resents them.  He lies to you and avoids talking to you.  You've begged him for years not to do this but he still does.  

I don't see this getting much better than it is.  You have all these problems and frustrations, and apparently he's so unhappy he's thinking of leaving you.  

Better to just call it a day.  Just tell him that you don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you, and if he's that unhappy, and you aren't so happy yourself, you should just figure out how to break up.  


"
"Are you absolutely sure she was talking about you? Did she mention your name? 

I'd just bring it right the hell up. ""I heard you on the phone with Dylan on Monday, talking about me. I heard everything you said. We are done, here's your junk, don't talk to me or call, and your vagina feels like I'm throwing a hotdog down a subway tunnel."" "
"And you? 

 I know he's your dad, but your top priority is your wife and son.  Your son should not have been put in a position where he had to defend his parents to his homophobic grandfather.  That's unacceptable.  And your dad isn't even sorry (of course, if he were sorry, he wouldn't have done it).  "
"Have you been to university or lived in a dorm? Deans don't deal with petty shit like this. As for holding your dean personally responsible, OP will get laughed out of the office with a line like that.

OP needs to either keep annoying her RA into actually doing something with the roommate and keep escalating things up the housing chain or take things into her own hands and bug the roommate rudely and constantly to shower OR put up and shut up. 

"
"Another thing to think about is leaving your current state/town. I took a risk two weeks ago, applied for a job 2K miles away and am now living in a whole new city. It's AMAZING."
"This is risky business.  I did the same thing and I despise my new city and I struggled with depression for the first time due to being separated from everyone I knew and having a job which ended up being atonishingly stressful.

If OP does try this method, realize there are some very real hazards."
"This is an unacceptable prank. I like horror movies and Halloween too, but I don't know if I could forgive someone for this kind of shitty prank to be honest. What the fuck.

He's lucky you didn't hurt HIM. I would have tried."
I can't believe this is so low down in the comments. Of course she needs to tell her. What if they get married and have kids? What if he has a serious STD? Not to mention he doesn't deserve to get married and be happy and she doesn't deserve the immense betrayal and emotional pain.
"My younger sister also had a problem with hygiene to the point that you could feel her stench through the door. Mind you, even my parents who are theoretically uneducated folks from the countryside brushed their teeth and showered daily. My sister just wouldn't. So my parents had to supervise her everyday day that she is brushing and showering. Very embarrassing. For us, not her obviously.


I am also curious where is this girl from all though I don't think it's relevant at all. For example, I met two guys during my uni days from the same country in South East Asia. Both educated, good backgrounds etc. One of them used to shower every other 2 weeks on the reasons that he will get a cold ( it was winter, we were in western Europe). The other one showered twice per day.  Now comes the funny part, we were studying biomedical sciences so he should have been aware about bacterias and shit...but nope. Superstitions FTW."
"She's hiding alcohol. That's why she doesn't want you looking through them. It's a classic move of functioning alcoholics. 

Source: dated a functioning alcoholic who went to rehab many times."
"It sounds like you're mostly upset that you weren't invited to the big, public party, not that your relationship with your daughter has deteriorated and she doesn't want you in her life. 

I've got a narcissist parent. Want to know when they reach out to me? Graduations and weddings. Otherwise they're content to just stalk me on the internet and badmouth me to strangers. "
"She wants to come over to snoop. That's it. End of story.

Just say, ""No."" If she asks why say, ""The reasons you specified for wanting to come over have changed multiple times, which tells me the only reason you actually want to come over here is to have control over our home. No."""
It was a typo but I'll leave it. I like this interpretation too.
If you don't need them for child care then that's a boundary you can enforce. Until they learn to respect you and your decisions as a parent they don't get to watch your son. Period.

"The point is that my friend has been lying to me. I'm over my ex, but the deceit is a fucking no no."
It does sound like a setup. Maybe the screen was even damaged beforehand and she figured she'd leave it at the bottom of the stairs so she could blame someone for the damage. At most offer to pay for half the repair but I'd tell her to kick rocks/pound sand. 
"Do you not talk with your friends about things going on in your life?

It was a casual lunch with a friend. We weren't gonna start discussing the potential fall of the European Union and its ripple effect. We were having fun and discussing things relevant to our lives at that point in time. 

It was a funny story. An anecdote, if you will. I find it amusing and thought my friend would, too. 

It's not that hard to understand. "
Typically children are ideal matches for kidney donation and you can survive just fine with only one so the joke is that they are dealing with kidney failure and need him to donate one of his to save them.
"No, the person who committed the crime against her was to blame.  

she is responsible for her own choice of taking employment that requires her to take the bus for transit, but that's not an unreasonable choice, and it remains no-one's fault but the assailant.  "
"Especially the way she asked, at the last moment! She knew that her usual ride was not there from the start. If I were in her situation, I would ask it first thing upon coming to work."
"Get away and block him ASAP.

He's toxic."
"He offered to pay, then he withdrew the offer when OP accepted. This isn't about wanting to fix things.

And for people intending to decide their votes based on this comment alone, I got my info from a comment OP wrote after the one I'm replying to. I'm simply trying to inform notovertonight about what else this ""boyfriend"" has done."
"""But how can I just convince these stupid short women that they don't realize that they want to date me!?!"""
"Hey OP, I'm so terribly sorry that you both are going through this. I was in a similar situation to your girlfriend's a few years back... I was forced into breaking up with the man I thought was the love of my life when he gave me an unreasonable ultimatum, and it destroyed him. The breakup started him on a downward spiral that he was never able to recover from; he got heavily into doing and dealing drugs, was intentionally reckless with his life, embraced his demons instead of trying to address or cope with them. We remained friends through all of this, but when things started to get really out of hand, I finally had to have a blunt conversation with him about the path his life had taken and how I couldn't enable him with my sympathy any longer while he refused to get the help he desperately needed. A week later, he died of an overdose. His family blamed me for his death and I was banned from his funeral.  

The best thing that you can probably do for your girlfriend right now is to a) make sure that you're giving her comfort and support in the ways she's most receptive to receiving it (you haven't been together very long so don't hesitate to ask her if you're not sure) and, perhaps more importantly in the long run, b) help her with finding closure.  

I know that for me, it was extremely difficult coping with the death of my ex because I wasn't able to attend his funeral. He didn't feel dead. It was too surreal, too removed from my life, too abstract for me to really come to terms with and accept the loss. I was riddled with guilt for months on end because I would actually forget he was even dead. To be honest, I still do. If you could do something with her once the dust settles a bit to help her find the closure she's going to need, you absolutely should. Maybe you could visit his grave, or hold your own memorial of some sort. Even just having her write something to him that she buries out in the woods somewhere, whatever it takes.  

Once again, I am so sorry that you're both in this situation. Know that the fault lies with neither of you; he was clearly struggling with far more than we could even speculate on, and his actions were his and his alone. I truly wish you both the best. You're a good boyfriend, and I'm sure she will never forget the kindness you have and will continue to show her in this time of need."
Staying friends? I would not try and save this relationship. Its only a matter of time before she tries again with a different (or same) guy.
"What an odd mix of comments.


A is a widow, at a young age.  It is natural that she would find a new partner at some point.  Assuming T could express any preferences, wouldn't he rather that the new partner be someone honorable and kind?  Someone who will treat A the way T would have treated her if he was still around?  Someone who will love his child?  Presumably T feels that OP is such a man, since they were good friends.  So I can only imagine that T would be happy, and that his memory is not tarnished in any way, by this development.


Now, if OP just had a one-night stand with A because he was able to take advantage of her vulnerable emotions, that would be reprehensible and disrespectful of T's memory (as well as generally shitty.)  But it doesn't sound like that at all.  It sounds like OP has genuinely come to care for A, and I assume her child, and there is the prospect of this being a real long term relationship.  I don't see how this disrespects T's memory.  I think, in fact, it sounds lovely.


If T was the sort of fellow who expected A to remain forever alone after his death, then T was not a very loving person and his presumed opinion doesn't matter anyway.  "
"Shitty irons are stress inducing. If he had ponyed up for a nice one, I would be a bit more sympathetic. "
I don't know why your wife thinks it's okay to just flat out ban things at will.
"Your boyfriend is kind of set up for failure in this scenario, yeah? He gets home from work and immediately starts to make something quick. In your mind this is wrong for two reasons - it doesn't include meat, and it requires very little effort compared to your curry. However, if he would have come home and spent two hours making something complicated, that would have been an issue because you're STARVING. So, lose-lose for the boyfriend. My suggestion is to make a menu. You pick seven meals, he picks seven meals. Sit down together and pick what you'll have each night of the week - that way you both know what to expect ahead of time. If you insist on meals of the two-hour-curry variety, then you should be prepared to be more proactive with the cooking. Prepare certain things ahead of time to cut down on prep the night of. Remember that your boyfriend can't read your mind. Also, you're 23, have a friggin snack if you're hungry."
"...it clearly would be a burden. you're obviously planning to get this dog now because you're moving in and planning on pinning the work on her. The ""little hobby"" shit sounds really misogynistic, too. 

I read the title expecting to be on your side, but it's crazy how you can't even see how you're just assuming it's a great idea for your gf to do tons of extra work every day just for something only you want."

"""I'm single and happy at the moment, thanks for asking. How is your life going?""

"This is what I was thinking. Some people are shy or whatever and have difficulty making friends, but other people basically see friends as someone to use when they need, so their friends tend to dump them after a while. She sounds like the latter. 

I'd honestly tell her money is tight (I feel, as a friend, she'd know about your situation already, even if not all of it, so wouldn't even ask) and, because I'm me, I'd tell her that it's great that we are friends, but a little more effort could be made and not just when she needs you. I know it's not popular, but I'd rather be without friends than have friends who use me. For me, makes me feel bad, like it's the only use I am to them, not me as a person. "
How is she not a normal girl and how is joining a sport not a normal thing?

"Totaled my car in a no-fault accident last year. Even went to the hospital to get checked out and everything, and ended up with a completely clean bill of health, save for a single bruise on my arm where the airbag deployed that was gone in like three days.

It's a lot easier than you'd think."
"From an outside view, this is obvious, and the implications of not telling is clear as day.

But the bio-mom/sister, is in the middle of this, has the motherly instinct to protect her child from anything and that includes protecting the child from the knowledge that she was abused. If this was Allison making the post, we'd tell her this and she'd probably ask herself how she could be so blind and tell OP straight away. But as it is now, Allison is not here, she's in the middle of this chaotic weird stuff going on. Not only has her son just found out that she's his mother and not sister, she's also dealing with the fact that her (probably) abusive father is coming into the picture. She's doing what she can to get OP to move in with her while still sheltering OP from the fact that she was abused by the guy. I know I'd have a hard time talking to my children (if I had any) about being abused (if I had been), even under normal and ""calm"" circumstances. She's also probably feeling a bit ashamed over being abused, even though she shouldn't, and on top of that, probably feeling ashamed for lying to OP about who she was for the first 16 years of his life. Add all that up, and it's not hard to imagine that she's not thinking completely rational in every aspect of this whole mess!"
What was her punishment for going to the counselor?
"You're going to hurt one or the other, that's the position B put you in. If you like A, keep seeing her, and let B work out her own issues."
"This man is what is colloquially known as a ""bellend""."
Keep blanking her - it's going to take time for the message to sink in. She's probably hoping it's a prank herself. If she's still harassing you in a couple of weeks - consider getting a restraining order.
I read this to my fiance. We were both wtfing. 
"Do you really not get a single day a year? Most adults have to make time for those days off. AKA do chores and other work in advance if they really want to spend an entire day doing nothing. Personally, I can't remember the last time I had one of those, and I'm sure I'm not the only one here."
"Keep a bit of emergency gas money in the glove box just to be safe, but id definitely consider leaving my money and credit cards at home.

"She can pound sand. You're right, you legally can park wherever you want on a public road, and she cannot reserve spots or prevent someone from utilizing valid street parking. Save the note, and continue doing what you're doing. If she starts escalating, get the police involved."
Seriously though OP need to get this shit into writing because Its going to get ugly when the parents die.  I have some background in estate law and I have seen families torn completely apart because they didn't get things in writing and keep them updated.
"Just wondering , when you speak do you speak enthusiastically and smiling occasionally? Sometimes I will get bored with a conversation if it seems like the other person is bored. Other times I will be super engaged when I see that the other person is passionate about what they are talking about."
"Talk to a lawyer ASAP.


Leave, do not sign yourself up to paying child custody. Talk about seeing him on the weekends to keep stability in his life. She might refuse - she might prioritise herself over your son - which would hurt like crazy. 


Focus on what's best for the kid, sure. But careful about her. You could contribute directly to an education/mortgage fund in his name, in lieu of formal legally required child support? That way she has no control over it."
"GET THE FUCK OUT! NOW!

Not tomorrow. Not later. NOW. You're not with him? Text him it's over. NO he doesn't deserve a face to face conversation. Your SAFETY COMES FIRST. Do not agree to meet up unless its a crowded public place with a friend of yours along.

Before you text him, make sure your parents, or more than 1 of your friends is over at your place in case he tries to come over to do sth funny if he knows where you live.

Fuck all the hotness and smart and funny you see in him. This is how abuse starts. RUN. NOW.

I was in your shoes. His attitude fits my ex's to a T. He ended up putting a knife near my throat while screaming for me to admit the cheating I never committed. Reading your post is making me panic."
"Yeah, it's the rope detail that's the worst. That takes it from ""I'm here to rob this place, a person at home might scare me off"" to ""I know you're alone, I'm here to hurt you, and I've brought rope to tie you up while I do it"".

At least part of him knew that's what you'd think, OP. That's why he chose to bring rope in the first place. The total want of empathy and common sense and care for you is staggering."
"You seem to have trouble wrapping your head around the fact that in your fiancee's eyes, this incident puts your brother into the category ""not safe to be around, under any and all circumstances"" for life. I cannot even fathom the idea of trying to be civil to a person who I know has casually roofied people.     "
"Honestly, I kinda think this was on OP if he knew that his friends were smokers. The friends probably assumed that since OP is 420-friendly, so was his girlfriend. At least, that's how it's been in every social situation I've ever been in that involved weed - people who don't smoke just pass the bowl, though, and don't partake, rather than calling the cops. "

"She told somebody that you will never be her ex... She basically said that you will never be good enough, and had she had a chance with her ex, you would be on your own. 

WHY are you even looking into other issues, when the girl is settling for you? Go out there and find somebody who loves *you* and not the fact that you are a ""good enough"" alternative when she cannot be with the one she really wants to be with?

If you think that you are safe just because her and her ex aren't likely to work it out, you need to realise that the fact that she has little love and respect for you makes her likely to fall for somebody else too. "
"This singer never replied to me though. She only retweeted those arts to her followers, and followed me back. No actual conversation has ever happened between us and I don't think it ever will. "

"I'm actually very worried for you, now he knows that you may know, which is not good. Do not act weird, different or say anything to him. Act as normal as you can, and fake it if you can't. If he did all of that he may track your phone or computer, please be careful. Try to go home for a visit as soon as you can, and get out of this situation. Things may be normal now, but clearly he has manipulated you in the worst possible way. "
"They spoon, rub each others bodies gently without humour, lay their heads in each other's laps, touch dicks...More importantly, you talk about feeling uncomfortable and your boyfriend sits there, aware of this, and let's his friend take multiple jabs at you, just letting someone rub his body in front of his gf. What the hell is wrong with both of them? 

His friend sounds more important and intimate with him than you. I think really, he was flouting it in front of you, daring you say something about how gay it is. Because he knew you couldn't do anything about it, and he's proud that he's #1. Your boyfriend knew, and sided with him when he stayed silent.

So this all depends on you. The answer to me is to gtfo, because of my sexual preferences. If that isn't a barrier to you, and it's simply a matter of having the right boundaries, then talk to him about it. But enter the conversation confident that whether something sexual or not is intended, that kind of intimacy is inappropriate for him to engage in while he's in a relationship with you. "
"I think he'd probably find a girlfriend if she had as nice a nutsack as your boyfriend has. Seriously though, all of this is ultra-weird. How exactly is it that you're sure he's not gay? Maybe because he loves to have sex with you a lot or something? Have you considered that perhaps he loves the pussy, but he also has a significant sexual and/or romantic thing for dudes?"
If I mock my friend's taste in music that's banter. Mocking disabilities is bullying. I do my best to protect my friends from bullies. That's what being a friend means.

"It's because women are constantly told to ""smile more"" and when we don't smike or are constantly ""on"" then people think we are unhappy or mad or sad. He needs to get over it."
"Plus, I wouldn't characterize standing at her door for half an hour and refusing to go away when asked as ""nice"".  

I mean, even if he had good intentions when he showed up with flowers, he expressly ignored her wishes she had previously communicated to him that she didn't want to talk to him again.  And then he stayed there even when she asked him to go away, and stayed standing out there even though she ignored him.  He only finally went away when she cursed and screamed at him.  He's not entitled to talk to her or befriend her or get back with her.  She's made it explicit that she doesn't want that, and he's ignoring that because he feels what he wants outweighs that.

She was probably scared when he wouldn't go away.  She might still be scared now that he has her address.  She might even be considering moving now because it seems like this guy will not take ""no"" for an answer.  

I mean she tried to stay friends with him, and he kept pushing for a relationship (I assume that's what dwelling on the relationship means).  So she had to cut him off.  I assume he has been trying to get into contact with her in other ways - usually showing up at someone's house when isn't the first step.  She explicitly did not tell him where she lives - unless you're completely socially inept that's a pretty damn good clue that someone does not want you showing up at their house.

At best he's just completely doesn't respect her feelings or wishes.  At worst he's a stalker.

And since he now knows where she lives there's nothing to say that this behavior won't escalate.  What happens if he decides to camp out at her house while she's at work so he can get her when she gets home?  What happens if he's now pissed and gets violent?

There is nothing ""nice"" about this dude.  If he was nice he would have done what she asked and left him alone.

(Edit: and I realize you're probably replying to a comment saying that this guy seemed like a nice dude and I know you probably realize he's not.  I just can't reply to the now-deleted parent comment and just can't emphasize to the people potentially reading this that just because someone is polite doesn't mean that they're actually nice or a good person.)"

"Hey fucked-up-butthole friend! I too have a giant, floppy leftover hemorrhoid that needs surgery! 

I DID talk to my husband about it, even though it was embarrassing. It helped to remind myself that to him, it's like how I feel about his one weird back mole, or the smells that come out of him after Mexican food. Aka it's not necessarily cute, but it's the reality of being this intimate with another squishy meatsack. 

I didn't get the surgery. My backdoor terrain is the result of pregnancy, and the timing was bad what with a newborn, and breastfeeding, and transitioning back to work. Would have been nice to knock it out since birth definitely makes you meet your out of pocket deductible, but that's life. Plus we're planning on one more, and what's the point of having butthole rejuvenation if some fetus is just going to go blowing it out again?

"It would make me sick to think my husband and brother got laughs from inciting panic from the general public. Hell a local school close to me was put on lock down because a clown was spotted in the area and making threats of violence against the kids there.

The clown thing will get him shot. Impersonating a police officer (other than a cheesy Halloween costume) will get him arrested. This level of immaturity is a deal breaker.

You've tried talking to him to just have your concerns dismissed by your husband and brother. It would be perfectly acceptable in my opinion to give the ultimatum of ""of stop all this immature clown or any other costumed prank or its divorce.""

If he brushes you aside again. Find a divorce attorney and get your stuff handled.

P.S As a mom from the South, creeping around as anything is a good way to get shot. 

Edit: If you do go the divorce route, screen grab from the DeviantArt account as evidence. Partaking in this behavior won't help him if he tries to sue for full custody. Also ban your brother from your house. "
"serious question: can't toys ""make up"" for the stimulation and penetration? you can have the warmth of his body and the exciting stimulation of the toy.

"Your siblings are all adults.  What's stopping them from leaving?  Mom?  She may have chosen a life of walking on eggshells, but that doesn't mean you all have to stick around and protect her from the consequences of that choice.  School?  Finances?  They realize there are on-campus resources that could help them find a new living situation and the means to pay for that, right?  If not, feel free to point that out to them (and to offer your couch on a temporary basis once you're settled, if you feel you have the means to do so).

Your dad has created this insular little fiefdom where he is king and the rest of you are serfs.  Unfortunately for him, there's a whole big world out there where things don't work that way.  Set an example for everyone else by breaking his hold over you and go."

You're not making any effort to cover yourself up and you know it.

"This pissed me off just to read so I can imagine how enraged and afraid your kids are gonna feel. Leave them alone. The kindest thing you can do for them is to leave them be to the (hopefully) happy lives they have managed to form despite having a narcissistic parent. It would be extremely selfish to stir up wreckage in their lives and devastate them all over again. Reading between the lines - 'there are considerable assets' - 'still fighting my demons to this day' - all you're likely to do is brutalize them again while holding money over their heads. 

You can leave them stuff without breaking their no-contact wish, but frankly it takes so much for kids to ditch a parent that I'd bet they want absolutely nothing from you at all. Consider leaving it to charity, or if you do leave them money and stuff, also leave a heartfelt letter that includes real, sincere apologies."
"I kinda thought about voicing myself but I feel like it would just hurt the school's reputation and other students if anything comes out of it.

"I think it's possible for someone to make a mistake that they'll never make again. On the other hand, your gf has a pattern of cheating. That's not an isolated mistake, that's who she is. If you start with her, she'll cheat on you. And she's a hypocrite because after cheating on her ex four times, she dumped him when he cheated."

Strangely enough, this is one of the few times when it's okay to give an ultimatum.  You can't live like this and you know, rationally, that he will continue to escalate without intervention.

You have the stay with me, get treatment, no contact with enabling friend, or leave talk.

Harsh, but without treatment and no contact with Tom your future is bleak."
"If you don't dump him (you should), you need to sit him down and flat out tell him, ""You have unrealistic and immature ideas about sex, and I will not be catering to them, period."" It is not a negotiation. He can learn and get over it (he's young, it's possible), or he can show himself the door. Most women need clitoral stimulation to get off. It isn't a judgement on his dick, it is simple reality. And basically all women masturbate. You have no reason to feel guilty, that's just an unhealthy and sad thing to let him do to you. For most women, learning to get themselves off makes them better able to get off with partners. Bottom line: it is YOUR body. If he can't respect that, he doesn't respect you, and it's time to show him the door."
"What do you mean by ""he has a temper""? What is he doing or saying while angry? What you describe here sounds somewhat understandable for the circumstance, since you *were* disrespectful by being late for an important dinner that he'd committed to for you, and you make a habit of being late. It sounds like it was the last straw.

Also, if you are pressing on discussing things when he is in a bad mood, and he says that he needs space and needs to discuss it later, *give him that space.* I realize that you have a need to resolve an issue, so at some point when you aren't arguing, come to an agreement that next time you have an argument and he gets too upset, you'll give him space with the understanding that you discuss the issue the next day, or later that day. He shouldn't put off discussions forever, but there are *many* people who really need a time out when they get angry. 

Now if he's attacking you verbally, getting physical or threatening, that is not OK, but that's not what you've described here. Is he behaving like that? I'm also concerned with his drinking and its connection to his temper. He should be able to handle keeping his drinking reasonable even while socializing with fellow students and colleagues. 

These need to be treated as separate issues. My FIL always said, and it's one rare thing he was right about, ""It's just as easy to be 15 minutes early as 15 minutes late."" If you're always late then figure out when you need to get ready, and start getting ready thirty minutes earlier. Make a sincere apology for being late, without making excuses, and make a sincere effort to be on time. 

*Separately,* bring up your concerns about his temper and drinking. Use lots of I statements. ""I feel like you've been increasingly in a bad mood and having angry outbursts, and that it  is worse when you're drinking."" and ""I don't feel safe or comfortable when you're yelling/on edge/whatever is going on. I need us to be able to solve our problems without yelling or anger."" If taking time outs in the middle of a discussion is what he needs to do that, let him have them."
"Ok. I never distinguished between here and real life, and I already said that I wasnt talking about desperation in relation to HER.  The desperation meaning this whole *i just want to meet a girl I don't know when I'll have another date this was a missed opportunity* thing you have going on. People like to be liked for who they are, not just because they are the right gender. Anyway, you don't want to listen to what I'm saying so that's fine, but if women get a whiff of that in real life (and YES, people can sense it even if you aren't saying exactly what you are here) they are going to run the other way.

Again, that's not what I said. We are talking about *whether I want a second date*. And it takes 5, maybe 10 minutes to determine that. If you can spend a few hours with someone but still can't figure out whether or not you want to see them one more time, that's a personal problem."
"It sounds like you often do little things to show appreciation, and in my experience doing small things often is better in the long run than doing a bigger thing but only once. Maybe a nice letter about how grateful you are to them, how much you enjoy their company and appreciate their help, and how you consider them family would be meaningful to them. Since they help you a lot, are there things you can do to help them too? Maybe you could set up a monthly dinner with them where you cook? Or maybe you could help with chores around their house when you're there? Other than that, keep them informed about your life and treat them like friends. Thank them when they do good things for you. I'm glad you have awesome people in your life :)"
"You're only seeing this from your perspective.  You were raised a certain way and you want to raise your kids the same way.  From her perspective, she was raised another way and wants her kids raised that way.

You're both healthy, functioning adults.  To each of you, it's obvious that the manner of parenting you grew up with worked.

This is probably going to require some compromise.  You might end up driving the kids to school until they are a bit older and then they can take the bus.  

Pick your battles, is this a huge deal to you?  Is there other things you want the kids to do that she doesn't like?  "

"It's not impossible for him to have downloaded it while out with friends for fun. Unlikely, but not impossible.

My boyfriend did this once, about 6 months into us being exclusive. He and his friends were out at a bar and bored, and they downloaded Tinder on his phone because it was the only one with service and started messaging girls with ""hysterical"" versions of ""Netflix and chill?"" Such as ""Hulu and relax?"", ""HBO Go and unwind?"", ""Amazon Prime and recline?"", etc (keep in mind, they were drunk, so this was undoubtably funny to them). He came home and, since he thought it was hilarious, he told me probably assuming I'd laugh. I was uneasy about it, and he immediately let me see the messages to confirm that he didn't respond to anything after the funny openers. So, is it possible to download Tinder for ""fun"" and not for hooking up? Yes.

That said, I then told him that I was uncomfortable with him having Tinder on his phone for ***any*** reason. Call me insecure, but that's how I felt and still feel. Not once did he tell me it wasn't a big deal or that I was overreacting because it was harmless, even though in this case it actually *was* harmless. And he didn't just delete the app, but he had me watch as he went into settings and permanently deleted his account, *then* deleted the app. Then *apologized*.

Your boyfriend at *best* doesn't respect your (valid) feelings and chose to go behind your back to download a hook-up app for shits and giggles. At worst he re downloaded it and refuses to delete it for ulterior reasons (such as using the hook-up app as a hook-up app).

Edit: a word."
"He's not doing anything wrong. Maybe he's taking pics to post on instagram. Maybe he's trying stuff on before he orders them online. Maybe it's just for fun. Maybe it's his lunch break and he's just trying clothes on.

He's not hurting anyone. He's not being disrespectful nor stealing. Yeah, I'm sure it's annoying to put clothes back, but that's kind of your job. Hell, I've gone in stores to try stuff on I know I won't buy just because. There's no problem here."
"You all don't sound like you're in your 40s..

If you're asking your female friends that you've hooked up with for relationship advice and your gf doesn't like it, then they should be up on the chopping block along with this friend of hers."
Nothing in the above suggests he is terribly compliant.  Are you just basing this on other more friendly humans you have known?
"Yes, OP prep yourself for when you do drop them that a few things can or will happen.

They may try to ""love bomb"" you to get you back into the fold. When that doesn't work, or if they don't do it, they'll go straight into ""you're a selfish brat and you should be grateful that we gave you x,y,z."" 

My best advice here is Ignore, Ignore, Ignore. Keep ignoring. When you reply, you agree to play their game by their rules. "

It's still a bit of a risky move if it doesn't correspond to a hobby, but at least it shows thoughtfulness. "
Honestly for valentines my boyfriend dumped like $200 on us going out and eating dinner. It was appalling when I found out. I was like baby in the future don't drop so much money! I can't imagine someone DEMANDING a $2000 gift. Like wtf. And is not something practical like A CAR. Or that fucking gorgeous table from pottery Barn you've been drooling over floor months. But  It's a fucking purse. I mean look I love expensive shit as much as anyone else. I love expensive shoes and dresses. But I WOULD BUY IT FOR MYSELF I would not pressure someone to put that kind of money in for me. Even then $1000 on one item is just so absurd to me. I could buy SEVERAL shoes for that kinda money.

"She should pay half of market rate rent for your condo.  All repair/maintenance/insurance costs are 100% yours.  Utilities 50/50.  I find splitting food costs 50/50 a bit unfair because men tend to eat significantly more, but this varies widely between individuals.

You might want to consult a lawyer about a cohabitation agreement and what, if any, scenario would give her claim to equity in your condo.

Also 6 months is way to soon to move in together."
"You handled that with poise and class. Good on you!

What is sad is that while there haven't been any formal complaints against him, it can almost be guaranteed that his behavior isn't new.

I'm a smoker too, I'm going to stop. When? God only knows. Eventually. Someday. Not today, not tomorrow, not this month. Just pen it into my calendar somewhere like ""maybe this will be the year"". 

His reaction is pretty harsh but some people really don't want to date smokers, and that's okay. If you want to smoke, that's okay too. But he's making it abundantly clear that having both him and cigarettes is not an option. "

"You're blaming your lack of discovery on your girlfriend when the only person you have to blame is yourself.

If you want to do all these things then do it - your girlfriend isn't holding you back, you are.

Tell Tom what's been going on. Then, confront John about his shitty behavior. You'll find that trying to force an eviction over this issue is a waste of time; it's neither illegal nor against your lease to be an immature jerk. You don't have to be friends with the guy to live with him. "
"Is it just that he is using newton and lowton as short hand for some town like that in that area?

Because chances are you'll be working in Manchester or Liverpool and it makes no sense to focus purely on two market towns within 30 minutes of those cities and not all of them.

Honestly you need to do your own research, have a look at jobs in your specialty in that area, have a look at the commute, have a look at the cost of houses in country towns in the area.

Put aside your relationship with your husband. Work out a firm idea of what moving up there will involve, what the advantages and disadvantages are. Have a look at jobs/houses in other comparable areas (small country towns 30 minutes from big cities) so you can compare to other options and come up with compromise suggestions.

And then once you've done that decide whether or not you're willing to move there and then once you've got straight, you can talk to your husband from a position of knowledge.

If your main problem is he's making big decisions without consulting you or considering your opinion, that's a different problem to whether or not you want to move.

Keep the two problems separate a) 'do I want to move and if I don't, do I not want to move enough to risk damaging my relationship with my husband'

and b) 'why is my husband ignoring my views on this and is that enough to damage my relationship with my husband'.

"&gt; Thank you for making me feel less alone.

No problem. Any time. 

I know being different in this way is tough. As I sit here, typing this reply, I feel that same affection bubbling up inside me -- that very genuine tenderness, as you put it, towards my fellow man -- and I know that the way we love is important and good. But then later, when my friends talk about their crushes and their dreams of getting hitched, the huge nothingness inside of me makes me worry all over again. 

I really do think that we're gonna be okay, though. I tell myself, ""if I grow out of this, that's awesome. And if I don't, there'll just be one more confirmed bachelor in the world."" Or bachelorette, in your case. We can still form meaningful relationships and make a positive impact on people without ""falling in love."" 

Anyway, good luck out there. 

**Edit:** Lots of people are talking about asexuality and aromanticism, so I wanted to add that I'm not asexual, just aromantic. Being ""just aro"" is even less common than also being asexual and aromantic, it seems. It actually made me feel weirder about the whole thing, because I was worried that I was some kind of scuzzball for occasionally getting the hots for people but having absolutely 0 urge to date them. Not sure where you fall, OP, but just letting you know that different combinations are out there."
"Took me a minute, but it's soon to be ex wife."
"&gt;After that, when we would have sex/do sexual things, he would get mad if I started touching myself. For example, sometimes touching my clit area during sex feels good for me and can help me get off; if I tried doing that, he would remove my hand and say ""no touching, this is mine"" (""this"" refers to my body) ... but then he also wouldn't touch me. If i do try to do this too often, he gets upset - ""oh, is my dick not good enough for you??"" I've tried to explain that I like the combination of sensations, but he won't listen. I do orgasm from sex, so it's not as though I'm not getting any pleasure, but I tend to have stronger orgasms from clitoral stimulation (I've told him this as well).

This alone is more than a deal breaker. Your boyfriend is controlling and emotionally abusive -- getting upset when you touch yourself during sex is manipulative.

Your boyfriend should want you to have the hottest sex you can. Honestly a partner should be *aroused* when he sees you rub your clit during sex. He should neither neglect touching you nor deny you the option of doing it yourself. It's controlling and hurts your sexual relationship if he doesn't ""allow"" you to have clitoral orgasms.

If you think this relationship is worth saving, sit him down and tell him in as many words exactly why his demands are inappropriate and that your sex life is going to be very different from now on. Non-negotiable. You will rub your clit. Maybe *he* will rub your clit. If he isn't okay with this, if he isn't *enthusiastic* about the idea of *you getting off better* I strongly advise you to end this relationship.

But honestly I think that it is unlikely that he can be this selfish, manipulative and controlling in bed without that spreading into other aspects of the relationship. I don't want you to fall for the sunk cost fallacy.

If you really want to stick it to him, show him this thread. People here are right to tear into what a shitty lover and possessive, insecure creep he is."

Ignoring just how inexcusably shitty a mindset this is for someone who's about to get married, this logic only applies for a few years. Eventually the kids get old enough for school and the nanny goes bye bye.

That being the case, you can eat  the nanny costs for a few years and end up higher on the food chain once your kid(s) become school age so that the two of you will be earning more than you ever have and recoup the costs (and then some) over the next decade and change and continue to be more financially successful.

You quit, save some money now and hit the reset button on your career likely leaving you earning tens of thousands less *for the rest of your working life* than you would in scenario A.

"I'm also suspicious of ""haven't got a reply back for several days."" Your wife vanishes off the radar for several DAYS and you aren't particularly concerned about that in and of itself? My husband travels a lot and we aren't a joined at the hip couple, but we get in a few texts or a quick phone call every day, minimum.

And this is where you went wrong in my opinion. Instead of telling him to get going with his agreed share of the duties, you just took on the role yourself, leaving him doing less and also not having to face the consequences. He stopped doing his work, you took up the slack. "
You can do so much better.

This dude doesn't care about OP or their child if he's willing to do this to their family while she's pregnant. "
"yes, only the most precious and irreplaceable thing in the whole house. "
"I'd go one strop farther and say she's just dumped one abuser for another one, there mail difference she highlighted seems to be that this one is more ""educated"" than her ex.  I'd argue that makes him just as bad, since he's more emotionally abusive in ways which are making her question her own sanity.  That shit wears you down real quick.  I had to physically move hundreds of miles away to save my own sanity in a similar situation with an ex, it was a nightmare constantly questioning if his stupid arguments might have any merit, and it's difficult to see if you're in the middle of it."

"First of all I'm not advocating a sunk cost here, what I'm saying is *something* worked between you two, you just need to (at least try) to unfunk the situation before nuking it.  Again totally my opinion, you can always break up with anyone for whatever reason you want.

It would be hard to hear something like ""I really love you and care about you, but you just don't seem to care about taking care of yourself anymore and it really effects how I feel about you‚Äù but I would imagine being dumped after 10 years with no explanation would probably be far more devastating."
"Write your sister off. She's chosen her family, she's chosen what you mean to her. Because this will not just be the wedding. Any family events she hosts be prepared for your parents to be told you  leave you at home.

Of course it's possible that you're just too much of an ""entertainer"" and she doesn't enjoy your personality. Or is worried that you'll steal her spotlight.


What have your parents said?"
It sounds like you're in this relationship to work through your parents relationship. 
"Keep doing what you're doing - block, don't respond or get drawn into any arguments &amp; they will move on to something else. Pretty much the only option if you didn't want to lock down privacy so randoms can't see anything about you. "

"&gt; she's made sure to tell all the coworkers that OP didn't give her a lift

Why do you assume Edith is being malicious? The woman normally gets a lift and then got attacked at the bus stop - it's not exactly some great leap of logic or something requiring of gossip for the coworkers to figure out that OP was the one on shift with her, and that if she was at the bus stop it means OP didn't give her a lift."
"No, he isn't obligated to give her a ride. But if he comes off as cold, uncaring, and somewhat abrasive, he should be prepared for people to treat him in a similar fashion."

"I really understand, and this honestly is all a bit ludicrous especially when typed all out and evaluated in such a way.

I understand that I'm privy to a lot of privileges, but taking a step back and looking at things in perspective is something I think is important to periodically do and I think that this is a jumping point for more reflection in my future. It's a bit laughable that I've known someone like this for 18 years and I'm just now better understanding this side of her, through a reddit post of all places but life's a funny ride."
Agreed. She had the time to plan an entire wedding (without her fianc√©e's consent!) but not to buy her a pendant? This takes selfishness to a new level. 
"&gt;We could not come to agreement.

This is so crazy because there is literally nothing for you and your wife to come to an agreement on. This is your grown daughter's name! She can keep her birth name, take her husband's name, hyphenate her name with his, or even make up or take on a whole other name entirely. None of these options are anything you and/or your wife have any control over whatsoever, so why you two would spend an evening arguing over this is ridiculous.

Tell your wife to ease back and if she can't get some act-right to keep her childish behind at home. If she rocks up on your daughter's wedding she needs to be escorted off, really. Unless and until she can truly apologize to your daughter for starting a fight where none exists, she needs to STFU about it and let her have a nice wedding day without spoiling it with her petty jealousy."
"&gt; Just clear up the question of PTO, and if it's not law that you get it maybe make your 2 weeks conditional on that.

Get it in writing because from the sound of it he will screw you over if you don't."
"Dude, you've posted this exact same question before. Either pay for her ticket or break up with her. It's not that complicated."
"&gt; I would hate for there to be awkward tension between families because of something that was meant to be a secret. 

It's only in dysfunctional families that things like a parent losing a job are treated as a secret. I know you've been brought up to think that Mom's emotional abuse and Dad's alcoholism have to be kept secret, but they raised you to hide what went on at home so that no one would intervene on your behalf. The shame and embarrassment you feel are understandable, but not because you *should* feel ashamed and embarrassed at this coming to light. You can love your parents *and* acknowledge their flaws. You can be angry at them and still love them. Honestly, it sounds like your boyfriend's parents are uniquely qualified to understand the complexity of human nature, and how people can be fucked up and still important to you. "
Sorry but you chose to have the abortion.  You don't get to decide ten years later when you regret it that someone else is to blame.
"What the actual heck. 

Leave him OP. 

Like seriously, who have sex with their co-worker( god knows how many times) and at the same time be worried about his relationship with you. If he wanted an advice on the relationship, that advice wouldn't have ended up with their clothes off. 

He's a piece of shiet. 

Argh. This makes me so angry that he can do this to you and even lie to you.

"To me, the issue here is less about infidelity, and more about respect.  Yeah, you guys never had the ""exclusivity talk"", but were calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend.

The fact that she actually had you hang out with the guy she was banging on the side - akin to cuckolding you - is what burns me up.  That's downright disrespectful, and I wouldn't be able to get past it.

Dump her and run."
"Does he know which friend(s) actually threatened you, and did he know they were doing this while you were broken up?

That, honestly, would have been the deciding factor in getting back together with him if you ask me. If he knew his friends (who are grown ass men) were verbally accosting his ex to the point of threats and didn't openly speak out against it and cut off the ones who took it that far, he wasn't worth getting back together with. This isn't high school. It doesn't matter who his clique is."
"If it were really that bad, I'd think she'd just not mention losing it at all.

Or maybe she lost it, suspected OP threw it out because he had dug into her past and she was testing him to see if he was actually the one acting inappropriately (snooping her past and throwing her things out?)."

"The number one thing is to keep contact. Even if she is not receptive to the ""your boyfriend is abusive"" stuff, keep contact. Cutting off contact will be one of the abusers goals. As many of her friends should keep contact as possible. Text her even if she doesn't respond(even just ""hi"") 

If possible for you, or any of her friends and family (make sure her family are aware of the situation) let her know that your home is open to her. 

During the conversation, mention resources in the local area that might be available to her if she needs help leaving (research before the conversation) "
"Resentment and differences in attitude/treatment when one person in the couple is not well, can completely tank a relationship/marriage if left unchecked.


I knew a couple where the man was chronically ill, wife started to resent doing all the house/kids stuff very quickly every time he had issues (also taking over running ""his half"" of their business. The flip side, and reason for growing resentment over time was that he didn't take care of himself at all, even when unwell (refused doctor's appointments, ate fast food and drank soda all the time - which aggravated symptoms - no attempts at quitting smoking etc)


Talk to your wife when you're both well (worst time is when one of you is sick), work it out and communicate.  She can make some adjustments, and you can too. If she's less demanding and more considerate of your needs when sick, you will be less resentful and more considerate of her needs when sick (not just going through the motions).

Hope it all works out."
You run away. Far far away.

"I agree that OP needs to get angry, but, she's still kinda in shock and going through a grieving process.   We are all angry for her, but to her it hasn't quite sunk in yet.    

OP, you need to think this out logically, though, don't let him explain this away or forgive him.  Keep your self-respect and leave.   Don't rely on your feelings, it's never going to ""feel right"" to confront him or to leave.  Try and think what you would advise a friend to do in this situation, and do that for yourself.  Healing will come with time and distance, the longer you stay with him in this state of indecision... it's not good."
"22 is young to marry, but you yourself pointed that out, you are clearly aware of that. But ""engaged sometime soon and having a relatively long engagement"" sounds risk-free and very sensible indeed. I see no possible downside in a long engagent from 22- ?25

"&gt;He is a very logical guy, I always say you could export his brain into an excel sheet. He always needs certain things met in order for him to be okay with it, and we just really look at things differently.

&gt;Things need to meet his requirements before he is emotionally okay with moving to the next step, in all aspects of his life. 

Regardless of whether or not he is putting you off with excuses, you do realise that you have to accept this side of him and learn to live with it if your marriage is going to work? 

It does sound like very difficult behaviour and that it might continue to be difficult to get him to make compromises and he might be a 'my way or the highway' type person. 

What if you want a baby but he needs to meet a list of 10 criteria first? Will you be happy to wait or will you end up disappointed? Or you want to buy a house in a particular area, or change your job? 

I'm not sure I could live with someone with this mindset. I would be worried that he would never met my needs. "

"I stand behind your sister 100%. You and your parents just seem to judge her and criticize her for every single thing. Her grades, her break with her bf, wanting to elope, not forgiving an neglectful alcoholic. Why would she want to include you in her life? What do you add other than guilt trips and criticism? Then your parents try to offer money to manipulate her into hosting a wedding *they* want rather than caring about her wishes? 


If my family was like this, it would only be natural to grow closer to my soon-to-be family instead. It sounds like her future in-laws are kind and supportive, which is the opposite of your family. Sorry OP, you're in the wrong."
"I would offer her half the cost of the repairs, or half the cost of the exact macbook, whichever is less expensive.  I'm not computer savvy, but I've been told that repairs can sometimes cost more than a new computer. I'd also demand estimates and receipts before handing over the money. If she refuses, she can file in small claims, and explain to the court exactly why she left it in a place where it could be expected to get stepped on."
"Indeed. OP is playing dual roles of GC and FM. 

Of course, no Nfamily is complete without its scapegoat; it's easier to get with the Nprogram and be part of the dogpile of abuse rather than refuse to participate (and often more beneficial).

god damn I hope this isn't true. People really get off on posting fake stories huh?
The thing is this isn't even a sexy person is it? It's a character it's not human it's not ever going to be human. It's not real. How can it even pose the slightest threat to a relationship? If she's that insecure that something that's not real is a threat to her then she needs to sort her own issues out instead of making her boyfriend take this down. 
"That actually does not sound like a good idea. 

It works for someone young who could easily get away but what is a 60 year old woman gonna do when she maces a dude in his twenties that already wants to assault her?"
"Yes, but his career is at stake now. He works in a very small office, and while he is right, he came off as a jerk, and then one of the worst things that could happen as a result actually happened.

In a small office like this, it's key that you have a good rapport with your co-workers. He might be good at his job, but he just moved to the top of the list to be let go next time there are layoffs."

"You said it yourself. You are his girlfriend, not his mother. If you want to stay together he is going to have to get his shit together. If he can't do this, and you don't want to break up, it does not sound like you should live together. When and why did you decide to move in? It sounds like you skipped over some vital conversations about living together before making such a big commitment. If you stay in your current situation you will simply grow to be resentful and bitter of him, and he will either become increasingly anxious and scared of you OR revert even more into manboy-ness. He needs to live by himself and take care of himself before he can have the capability to work towards the relationship it sounds like you want. "
"&gt; He is intelligent and knows absolutely everything about music, fashion, design, even life. The amount he knows people would call him a show off but he wasn't because he NEVER EVER said he knew something which he didn't actually know. He never lied. He always called people out when they did this. He had a tendency of making people feel very uncomfortable because of how blunt yet clever he was.

Ughhhhhhh, these dudes are the worst. NO one can UNDERSTAND how deeply they FEEL, NO one could POSSIBLY be as CREATIVE as them, they're just too PASSIONATE, and if you get bent out of shape because they've been cheating on you, YOU just don't UNDERSTAND the life of a ARTIST and how INTENSELY they have to LIVE IN THE MOMENT.

When you suggest that maybe he not get high or drunk right before brunch with your parents, YOU'RE not the kind of CHILL PERSON he THOUGHT you were, and what is it going to MATTER in 100 years, huh? You're being SO CLOSEMINDED!

OP, ""a tendency of making people feel very uncomfortable because of how blunt yet clever he was"" is a very kind way of saying that he's an asshole. You have this glittery idea of how incredible fame and popularity must be, and how incredible the creative life is, and what incredible parties they go to. 

How about how amazing it is to be intelligent enough to get into medical school, or how incredible and rewarding it can be to save the life of another human being? It looks grey and thankless to you because you're actually doing it. I daresay that Sasha and her friends have a rosier idea about what your life is like, just like you do with theirs.

Being with this man made you feel like shit about yourself, and your family, and your friends. The actual people who love you and have been supportive of you. He is toxic to you. You have a horrible, distorted idea about yourself and your self-worth, and I would seriously suggest you go to counseling and talk this all out to regain a sense of self-esteem."

"I so much want a good machete for my next birthday now. No one ever thinks to give women tools as gifts, probably because of blah blah gender norms. I moved out when I was 18 and quickly realized I lacked even basic tools. No hammer to hang up pictures, no wrench to fix my bike, not even a screwdriver for any basic repairs. So I started asking for tools for Christmas and birthdays and while most people have raised eyebrows, they have usually delivered. Of course the big difference between myself and OP is that I am specifically asking for tools. If someone had gifted me an iron or similar housecleaning supply, I would have been offended and have wondered what message they were trying to convey. Best rule is to always ask."

My point was that without the hatred he has for me and my friends, would he have so much disdain and anger in himself?

But at the end of the day if the person I love tells me that they enjoy talking on the phone with me, I will definitely compromise and work with them and call them regularly.

I think u/icebergmama has a good suggestion about hair color change. Change up your hair. It would be a good idea to change your last name, also. If you take those steps, you'll be less recognizable both on paper and in person. "
"I guess I'm not sure. Let's just say my bf is definitely not gay. Whether he might be bisexual - I don't know that with certainty. I guess it's possible? He's a loyal guy, though. Even if he were bisexual, that would be pretty disrespectful to act out on it with his best friend in front of me.

I totally agree it's excessive. I just wanted that reassurance before doing something about it. The thing is, I'm not sure how to pursue that conversation or what to even say. I don't want to shame him or make him feel controlled. No one likes to be told what to do."
"No, it wasn't a threat. I made my boundaries clear, and then left him to decide for himself. "
"Tell your friends to stop ferrying messages from him.  When they bring him up, be blunt: ""Actually, Creep and I are not friends anymore.""  ""I'm not actually interested in how Creep is doing.""  Please stop bringing up Creep.  I am not interested in hearing about him."""
"Everything you're asking here, I'd ask her. 

It sounds like you trust her, and she's good at what she does. I bet she'd have some guidance. "
"Girl. Please. Set some boundaries for yourself. This man is taking liberties with your body without your permission and, explicitly, against your wishes. Were you not married I'd say break up with him. It's your body and your life. Please don't let him determine it for you."
"I definitely understand that, but he could've called protective services over here and at least had me removed from the home. Even if he would've just said that, that would be fine with me. I just need some answers. 

I haven't ever ""harped"" on this. I asked once why he never attempted to see my brothers or I more, but, this is the first time I'm really asking everything else. I'm also not throwing around accusations not continually bringing this up. I just wanted to know why. "
"&gt; Every damn day with this shit from her and he's like ""I just want it to stop""... as if he couldn't end it in a heartbeat.

Given a comment he made about how Barbara would make his life miserable if he went without her, I suspect OP is strongly anti-confrontation. My dad was like that, avoided conflict at all costs, and his life was miserable because he wouldn't stand up to my mom."
"&gt;Holy. Fucking. Shit. The bullshit rationalizing in your post is disgusting.

THANK YOU!  I am glad this is the top post.


""I felt even more in love with my boyfriend as I walked back to my home, as if there was a greater part of me to give him now. I am not certain about much, and I am certain I will never cheat on my boyfriend again. I want my life with him. I have never felt this certainty and contentment about a human being before.""


That is the biggest load of horseshit I've ever read on this subreddit.  It's not freedom she's feeling.  It's guilt.


""Do I tell my boyfriend what I did, and risk causing him hurt, jealousy and trust issues, as well as the potential compromise to my relationship?""

Is telling him really going to be the compromising part?  Are you sure it's not the whole sleeping with your ex part that did it?


""What would you recommend I do?""

Tell him and then follow it up with ""I have a lot of soul searching to do to find out how I became this person.""

The don't date anyone until you find the answer to that question and come up with a solution.

P.S.
&gt;Give your boyfriend then chance to find the ""clarity"" about your relationship that you somehow magically found at the end of your ex's dick.

That was beautiful :)"
"Keep your chin up, there's someone out there who's right for you. If this girl is not that person, that is *no one's* fault. 

Good luck, man. You sound like a good person. "
"That's a stupid reason to break up.

I'm a lot like her. I feel very, very deeply. My relationships have always been 70/30 love share, but that's only because I have a condition that makes me feel on a deeper level than other human beings. She may have the same... why is it such a problem for you that you don't love her *as much*? Why not just be happy that you love her and she loves you back, regardless of ""how much"" love you have for each other?

You were happy, weren't you? and so was she? So why aren't you going back to her on your knees begging right now like you should be?

FFS GET YOUR ASS BACK THERE AND SWEEP HER OFF HER FEET! YOU HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE!"
"OP was a lot more clear this time. OP told her BF that she DOES NOT want to TRY to be friends with the other girl this time around. Thus, BF would never invite his childhood friend again. If it does happen, like OP said, she will break up with him."
"It sounds like you've turned this all into a huge problem in your head but have never actually pressed this super major issue in person. I bet he'd be astounded that you are considering leaving him if he doesn't propose because he probably has no idea you expect or want him to.

Communication is key. *Tell him with your words that you want to marry him* and make it clear (with your words) that you want this to happen sooner rather than later. Then discuss. Don't read in things he doesn't say, and listen to what he does say. "
"Why would you hide the fact that you jerk off?


Consider this, you are hungry, so you ask your wife to make dinner with you (or go out, whatever). She refuses for whatever reason. 
Do you not get off your ass, and go have a meal, proudly alone?


It's the same with sex, you have a need, both of you. If you need it fulfilled then go and have it fulfilled. You can fuck her if she wants, or you can fuck yourself. Either way the need is fulfilled. 


If she flips then just state your need. It's fuck me or fuck you."
My advice would be to not be in a relationship with someone you can't talk to about your sexuality. Just tell him. 
"I mean, for some this level of betrayal is enough to want to cut ties, and guarantee no access to potential future weddings nor potential future grandkids.

When put in this perspective, are they even family anymore? Who cares about calling the law in this context...

I'm not saying that's what I'd mean with ""I am incredibly disappointed and your word cannot be trusted"" if I can make do on my own and there is no other instance of it. But some people would.
"
Do her a favor and don't go out with her.
"Not only would I file a police report, I would make this incident publicly known at the church as much a possible. "

This sounds like a job for Child Services.  
She's very lucky to have you. 
"&gt;I don't know how to explain it, but I know he really finds ""extremes"" in people attractive. For example, a hispanic girl with booty shorts, and large breasts sticking out of her shirt. A tall skinny blonde with huge boobs. Overweight ladies with extremely small waists and large breasts. Very muscular/fit women. Women who dress up goth, punk, bohemian, preppy, etc. But it has to be taken to an extreme.

This is fetishization. He fetishizes your ""weirdness"" and that's why he doesn't want you to change. It's a huge difference between having a preference and getting off on the extremity of the stereotype. 

It absolutely sounds like he gets his jollies by being the straight laced dude with a wild girlfriend. Honestly, his love reads as almost inauthentic and completely conditional upon your outward appearance. And while it's fair that you can lose attraction to someone based on ways their appearance changes, it's usually in a context of that partner no longer taking care of themselves, and negative health effects. 

I don't know, fetishization (especially of ""weird girls"", because i am one) really gets my heckles up, and I just hope it's not the case here, OP. I'd encourage you to ask him what he loves about you that isn't tied to your appearance, maybe next time he gets weird about you wanting to make positive changes. Good luck &lt;3 "
"&gt; So in your mind OP should just remain chained to her husband and not leave his side even for a few minutes?

What I am saying, from personal experience, is that when someone  you love is dying from cancer, and their breathing turns into what we call a ""death-rattle,"" and you know that any moment could be their last, you're not going to want to drive twenty minutes home, take the dog for a ten-minute walk, and then drive twenty minutes back to the hospital. You're not going to want to risk missing your last chance to say goodbye.

What part of that is difficult for you to understand? Why do you have to twist my comments like that? Come on, have some integrity for a moment."
"I know someone like this‚Ä¶it's almost as if you described her exactly :P

These sort of people can be very draining to be around. It's ""their way or the highway,"" ""I just *can't* do XYZ, etc. I know you said you've tried to mention this behavior to her (and I know too well how that often goes) but if you really want to make it work, then talk to her, calmly, when she is in a good, rational mood. Make sure to phrase it so that it is not accusatory (you never do this, or you always do that) and so that it emphasizes that you would like to work on it together (I would like it if we tried‚Ä¶). If she starts getting defensive and acts like you're being the bad guy, even if you're being calm and understanding with her, then I think you have your answer. 

From your post, though, it sounds like you already know what you want to do. It doesn't sound like you want a life with this woman/girl, and the sooner you admit that to yourself and walk away, the happier you'll probably be and the sooner you can move on with your adult life."
"You are the most amazing man I've seen post on here in a long time. Continue to tell your sister you love her, and continue to tell your family that they need to stop the anger. They're only hurting themselves. I wish you all well. 

Edited to add: Give them time. There is a very true old saying, ""This too shall pass."""
"&gt;  low and behold most threads you had to REALLY SEARCH for the guys who were in support of the implants

FYI, I've had small boobs my entire life, and I've never dated a guy who seemed anything but THRILLED to see my boobs.  Seriously, this dude needs to fuck off and find a woman that fits his physical preferences."
"Yup. It's good advice to CONTACT a lawyer, but there seems to be this assumption that we all have someone on retainer. "
"Personally, I disagree. I don't think that it is selfish to not give an organ. I think that it is selfless to give it. And selflessness, imo, is never the expected default. If my brother refused to give a liver to save my father, mother, siblings or me, I wouldn't think an ounce less of him. "
"Idk, I guess I never considered she may be a narcissist? I've honestly had minimal contact with her. Like some, ""yeah my dad sucked growing up, how was he when you were married?"" stuff but nothing really life shatteringly serious. I thought a narcissist would talk about themselves more. I guess I considered her a mom who had her child ripped from her, for the longest time. (Dad had more money for the divorce, and apparently evidence I was neglected.)

But to hear i was born because she thought I would fix their relationship made me lose any sympathy for her. Even after growing up with stories about how she left my dad by leaving a note after his deployment saying ""welcome home hero.""

They're both super fucked up people. dad's dead so I can safely hate him I guess. helps me to not miss him. but it hurts that i hate my mom for being a shitty person too I guess."
"The advice I was given when I found out that my ex had cheated on me multiple times in the past and I found out:

You don't go into a relationship expecting something bad like that to happen, so looking back and kicking yourself, or looking back in anger is NOT going to change anything. You did nothing wrong, your fiancee did.

We don't expected to be cheated on in a relationship, so we don't look at the signs of cheating. But it does fuck with your head going forward.

I find it hard to date now because I wonder if this new guy I'm dating is lying about being single like my ex did (to me and to other women). Is he sincerely interested in me or is he just using me? I've had to peace out of drunken make out sessions because my head would start asking those questions ""wonder if he's married?"" ""wonder if he has a girlfriend?""

It's hard, and it's up to you to set the boundaries / expectations in future when you meet someone. For example: My expectation is now that by the third date I want to at least be added on his FB (no relationship confirmation, just we admit that we at least consider each other friends).

Within the first two months I want to meet some of his friends (especially a few female ones just to get a sense of what his friendships with people are like).

The above two are what I expect now, and I refuse to budge on them at all. I'm not asking for status confirmation right away, but I am asking that I am at least acknowledged even in some little way when it comes to the life of any guys that I date.

So figure those out for yourself and take your time and be patient, don't push yourself and don't let anyone push you.

As to herpes: so? It is LITERALLY not as big of a deal as everyone else makes it out to be. I was a health reporter for YEARS and I had doctors constantly tell me ""seriously, it's not a big deal,"" and I also researched WHY we actually make it a big deal.

Why is herpes such a bad thing? Advertising. Companies that advertise products to help cover/diminish/briefly send away an INCONVENIENCE make the most money by SHAMING us. Think of any commercial about Cold Sores. All they do is shame people. SHAME SHAME SHAME. Even though the majority of us got those sores in a completely benign way.

Check out the YouTube series called ""Adam Ruins Everything"" titled 'You Probably Have Herpes and That's Okay' if you want a brief overview. (Would link but not sure of policy)."
"I see a lot of posts telling him to get out ASAP, for what it's worth."
"It's also nice just to pay the lawyer to be the one to talk to the other person. It's hard not to get emotional or defensive, and they also know what's utter bullshit and what is legit.

Given the husband wants to move back to Michigan, things do need settling, like where are they going to file if there's a dispute over custody or child support (which OP should have be wherever she resides with the child). And the custody/parental rights situation needs documenting, or she's going to regret it later if he decides he wants to mess with her or something. Right now it looks like he wants to leave it all behind so he can start fresh with this woman, but he may change his mind later.

My divorce also started with me thinking we could do this the nice way, until my ex fired off the biggest wad of ugly lies in an attempt to screw me for custody. And then it devolved into a situation where he wanted to have a discussion about every last possession as to who got what... Stuff he'd never cared a whit about now had to be evaluated. It was childish to a ridiculous level."
"I agree, I really hope OP's daughter cuts them all out of her life once she graduates."
"I grew up with a similar martyr-when-it-suits-her mother.

What she's trying to do now is to shame you into apologising to her for daring to pass comment on her poor behaviour. Because trying to make the people around you think that you are better than then is REALLY POOR BEHAVIOUR. 

With insight, you can see what is happening, but for her, it's this thing she's never really contemplated, or it's what she does to get an ego boost and you commenting on it threatens to make her act better and lose whatever jollies she gets from acting better than other people by using a pretentious voice like Mrs. Hyacinth Bucket from a UK show (basically she acts like she's better than everyone else).

So, back to things - she's trying to use shame and guilt to get you to mend the damage and apologise/grovel/make it up to her. But you honestly don't need to follow along with her game.

Text her back, say ""If you're going to be uncomfortable and not even willing to be civil to me at this dinner then perhaps it's best if you sat this one out. We'll talk later in the week.""

Take control. This is all a test of will. She's been getting her way for a very long time (almost ALL of your life) so it's going to be hard for her to understand that her tactics are no longer working. She may very well escalate her behaviour to a wider audience, so she gets a kick out of being a martyr and you will be shamed by the church community and suddenly find people who you don't really talk to call you up and asking why you're such a terrible daughter.

I survived this stuff. My mother is on a very limited information diet. I no longer visit her or allow her to visit me (tbf she never made the effort anyway). She gets a phone call at Christmas but I spend it with my In-laws - who have never tried to shame me because I ""dared"" to thwart her will by making a completely reasonable request. Because that one comment that started all this? It was perfectly reasonable. She did over-react and now she's steped up the campaign to make you fall back in line. 

So sorry you are dealing with an immature parent. So many of us are :/"
I know what he's trying to recruit you for.
Are you sure that's your kid and she's not just using you for money to pay back her debt?
Thank you for providing honest insight from the other side.
Agreed with /u/hellogo55.   They must provide her with good service.  They don't have to like their customers just treat them right.  Leave it alone because it will spoil it for her.   
"Sounds like a difficult situation. Although it may seem that depression defines the person you're with, that's not her. I would sugest having someone to talk to about this, like a close friend, someone outside the relationship, because it can , as you've already experienced, drain your energy and turn what used to be an awesome relationship in something bitter and sad..
 It is overwhelming sometimes and the choice is yours to make, but if you choose to stay , I recomend patience and being comprehensive. That's why it's so important to be able to talk about this with someone who isn't her.
As for how to talk to her about this.. Careful and lovingly... Make clear that you want this to work and that's why you are doing this, tell her that you still love her and that you're gonna fight for this, but that you can't do it alone...

Good luck mate, hope everything works out for you and your wife :)"
"Definitely one of my top three 'moments' of my life. There were other crazy things that happened (like him casually discussing this weird Scottish poetry orgy thing he took part of!?!? And hobo masturbation stories!?!? Super freaking weird and inappropriate to discuss with a near stranger. )

Thankfully I don't have to see him often and I will very definitely try not to be alone with him.  Thanks for the feedback. "
Its hard to really tell if the parents are neglectful or normal. This is a sixteen year old girl with a sister about to run away. I am not sure who is more correct.
Money is my first thought too. I can't imagine two older people having an easy time handling a farm by themselves even if they are life-long and relatively successful small farmers. I think they want money from him.
"&gt; They said . . . 

*They* didn't say a thing.  These absolute shit storm of parents couldn't even be bothered to contact OP via the same means his cousin did and say anything.

And as a mother of five, I want it known that I'm using the word ""parents"" very loosely here.  u/disowned1, **families are made up of people who love you and care for you**, not necessarily people who birth you.  Stick with your found, loving family of friends and SO's.  

"
You moved a laptop too often which voided the warranty... That sounds stupid on so many levels.
Exactly. Or it's the Olympics. Or maybe that they're a Spice Girl.
"She's a dick too, though. She waited until the last possible moment to be like, ""oh, by the way I just assumed you'd do me a huge favor"". If she was concerned about it, she should have asked earlier. OP doesn't owe her a lie, excuse, or apology over it either. Does she even pay the coworkers who are dropping her off for gas? No is a full sentence. By the same token, OP was likely aware of the situation and could have confronted her at the start of the day, like, ""Hey, I know you normally rely on Coworker and that we're the ones closing up tonight, but I won't be able to give you a ride, so I wanted to give you time to make other arrangements."" But he didn't OWE her that. Regardless, both of their actions (and lack of communication) did result in a sad outcome. 

OP, if you apologize for anything, it should be about not communicating earlier and better. Not for not giving the ride."
I think it's clear when she says not much was resolved...that friend is history.
Saw the title and instantly thought the same thing. 
This is a really nice idea! Never thought about it. Cheers! :D
"I highly doubt Mark thought you'd get pregnant by another man when he said that. So, don't try to reflect what happened here back on him."
"If the women don't find you handsome, at least they'll find you handy!"
In addition to what another comment said about talking to a school counselor and your parents it sounds like your teacher from last year (who asked you to escort the younger student) could be a good person to talk to since you have a good relationship with him and he seems to have one with the teacher who yelled at you.
"I was just coming here to ask if you're Carib, as that sounds nothing like a domestic med school. That said, that doesn't mean you won't match; my husband's program has two from SGU and one from AUA, as well as an FMG. Bad Step 1 will hurt you a lot, but if you can nail Step 2, it won't hurt nearly as bad so keep your chin up. I assume you're going for IM or FM at this point?"
"You are both being cliche, to be honest."
"Seriously read this guys responses. I normally don't like to throw around psychology terms as the only psychology credentials I can claim are of the armchair sort, but I highly suspect OP is a sociopath. He has zero empathy for the victims and can't acknowledge how sick, deranged, and just plain *evil* his brother is. The only feeling he has is 'ZOMG I can't turn in my brother or cut him off, what kind of rat does that?'

 I hope and pray his poor fiancee opens her eyes, sticks to her ultimatum and DTMFA. I can't imagine marrying and having a family with someone who wouldn't at minimum disown this family member. His brother belongs in jail or a psych ward"
"Apparently, being a ""promise girl"" makes you four times as likely to perform oral sex, and twice as likely to have anal. I know of girls who have done it for the first time anally because they thought they were still a virgin. 

The poophole loophole."
This sums up my reaction to OPs post perfectly.
"I don't know why this isn't higher. If you have the insurance on it, report it there. You'll still have to pay the deductible but it's better than a whole car. And if it is shared insurance, just report it as whomever else was driving it and it will affect their record. "
How did she not see this being an issue when she moved in in the first place?
"but... *he didn't even wrap it*

:( Maybe the iron with a nice card and some wrapping wouldn't be so bad. OP's story just screams ""I put the minimum amount of effort in.""

And then yelling about her being ungrateful instead of trying to understand her feelings. *Sigh...*"
"I get why at 22 it seems very important to be perceived as a Real Adult^TM who should be treated with respect.  But would it really kill you to be one of the kids once in a while?  She is your sister, not your niece or your child; *of course* she sees you as someone on the same level.  I had siblings who were much older than me, and one of the things I really appreciated about one of my sisters was that she treated me like an equal, instead of talking down to me like other adults.  Maybe just take this as an opportunity to unleash your inner child once in a while."

"Part of experiences ""not turning out well"" if you don't do your due diligence of learning about the drugs you're putting in your body, is that you might damage your relationships with people around you. Honestly, that's one of the milder consequences he could have had.

Drugs isn't a get out of jail free card. Any further choices he made as a result of his original choice to do drugs, are still his responsibility."

33 and ghosting a 20. Not surprised you have to date girls half your age.
"This is really making me rethink doing my boyfriend's laundry for him...I really was trying to be nice (and he flipping needs it to be done!!!!) but you're right. I need to take a step back and let him wallow in his filth since obviously having me do his laundry is more upsetting to him than him not having any clean laundry is to me. And yes...he literally asks me not to do his laundry. (Sometimes, he's very relieved and thankful. But if I ever make a mistake, he's enraged!)"
"&gt;  I meant it would be nice for them to be around to support us emotionally.

you worded it completely different

&gt; We run our own business and having family around to help would be much appreciated

that legit sounds like you want to use them. not for emotional support."
"Yeah, you're done. This is the end of this relationship. Given your edit, you are not motivated to protect yourself, so you need to start protecting your child. Your husband has the kind of anger issues that you should never leave your child alone with. The best way to ensure he isn't left with your child alone/ that you get full custody is to start documenting violent incidents, and this is one of them. A violent incident together with documented psychiatric problems may be what you need to prevent him from being around your child. I know it's hard, but you need to get away and keep him away from yourself and your child. PTSD is NOT an excuse, OK? It's a description."
"&gt; You are not equipped to handle her and don't even like being around this poor kid. Leave her and your sister alone.

her sister isn't equipped to handle her or the four year old wouldn't already be intolerable."
"One thing to consider is that the intruders may have heard your husband's voice and then gotten nervous when they realized he wasn't in the home anymore. 
You'll never know at this point, but it's at least worth considering that him leaving the situation may have shortened how long they were in your house. "
Depends on what the behavior was.  Right now you have no examples of his shitty behavior.
"In defense of your bf, he probably thought you'd be thrilled since you said you needed one and he paid attention.  But I'd be pretty disheartened by a girl like that, too.  I think this is one of those times where you might have to walk him through what makes a good gift for a girlfriend, and what is something you should buy yourself, or get from, say, your parents ore someone else non-romantic. "
"Thank you for that. It really means a lot. I can't change what happened, my parents, or who I am, but at least I can take comfort in the fact that other people are more sympathetic (and empathetic) towards the situation."
"I can't believe you're 32 years old, lol."
"Im gonna just take a guess and say if he gave you his number, he's interested and would like for you to text him."

"&gt; Am I wrong?  How do I smooth over relations with my coworkers again?  Should I apologize to Edith?

Lazyaccount and PurrPrinThom both just gave you advice and answered your questions and it seems to me like you are purposefully being dense. It seems like you only want to hear from people who agree with you.

"
"I definitely understand why he doesn't want to.  That doesn't change how he went about it.  Or the attitude he's giving off right now.  It's not exactly a dick move on their part either.  Just from his account, it appears he's shown to be very uncaring.  I wouldn't expect my coworker to give someone a ride home, but I'd be pretty turned off if this situation played out in a similar manner.  "
"Haha I like how this woman got mugged and somehow you're the victim. 

Holy shit dude take a step back and look at what you're saying."
"As I have told other people about manipulation...she purposefully waited til you were vested in the relationship before she dropped this bomb.

She waited until the exact moment when she thought you would be incapable of walking away.

You have been lied to and manipulated since the very moment you met this woman.  She pretended to be someone she is not.  She pretended to love you when she didn't.  And why?  Because you made her life easier.  She knew all along that what she was doing was wrong and unfair...but she did it anyway.

She only cares about herself.  Now that may not be her fault because she grew up in a fucked up home...but it does not change the fact that she only cares about herself and nobody else.  And it certainly does not change the fact that your entire relationship up until this point has been built on a foundation of lies.  She may very well think she loves you now, but just because someone loves you does not mean having them in your life is what is best for you.

She has only been thinking about herself all these years.  Its time for you to take a step back and decide what you want and what you think you deserve.  If you think you deserve better, then brother, you deserve better

I wouldn't even bother talking to him about this. I'd just be done already.
"I hope any money that makes their way to the family from Chelsea is given directly to the daughters in a way that benefits them alone, such as college funds, or paying for THEM to visit, presents for THEM that would be no use to Emily or OP etc.

"He approached it poorly in that situation, no doubt about it, but that's not what I'm referring to and you know it.  You're making a specific accusation about his viewpoint on women generally, and it's a long leap from what he wrote to what you arrived at.  In fact, based on his response elsewhere in this thread, it seems that you're completely wrong:

&gt;I don't think I deserve better, that's not the problem. The problem is that I'm concerned about my current GF's weight and health. I also don't find overwheight girls attractive, that's just my feeling. I'm sure there are guys who don't mind at all and that's OK. 

As for whether it's healthy or not, there's no way for us to tell since there is so little information about it in the post.  You decided to fill in the least charitable possible interpretation and run with that, which is ridiculous.  If we're talking about a 5'11"" woman who gained 10 lbs of fat over the course of 3 years from a starting point of 130 lbs, then I 100% agree with you that he's out of his mind.  If we're talking about a 5'1"" woman who gained 50 lbs of fat in 6 months from a starting point of 130 lbs, then you're 100% wrong and there could be a serious mental or physical health issue that needs to be addressed (and I would say the same about a man who gained that amount of weight over the same time period as well).  It's *just not possible* to say with the amount of information we've been given, and assuming one way or the other helps nothing."

"&gt; Age and maturity are two completely separate things. When I was 15, I had friends in their late 20s and 30s, some of whom were more immature than people my own age. Maturity is down to personality, not age

You're absolutely right that physical and emotional maturity are different, and that a large age difference doesn't *necessarily* mean anything.

The problem, however, is that *everyone* thinks that *they're* the exception to the rule. (""Sure, I wouldn't want that for other people, but I'm different."") The reality is that we're often not good at seeing ourselves objectively; especially when we're younger.

My older siblings caused much more trouble and so absorbed more bandwidth.  Or, by the time I did something, I was the last one to do it, and where my siblings achieving this was widely celebrated, for me, it was just ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

(My favorite example of the latter: when the oldest child graduated college, it was a long weekend celebration that is still stuck in the family's memory for the opulence of the hotel we stayed at in the university town, as well as the many fabulous meals at many fabulous restaurants.  Mine involved me having to bail right after commencement without getting to say goodbye to most of my friends, because I had to drive home so I could have take-out Chinese and a sheet cake.)

To this day, if my siblings do something, then it's the coolest, bestest, most original thing ever.  The fact that I usually introduced the thing to the family is glossed over, or I get ""Jeez, stop trying so hard, Chasmosaur - what do you know about this?""

My family wonders why I speak them as little as possible these days, and don't share much about my life, either.  Because it has long been established that no one gives a shit - anything and everything my siblings do has weight and importance, and everything I do has little to no impact at all."

Your sister's home life is so unstable, but you also don't want to have to force yourself to be stuck in this awful situation.

Is there any way maybe Chris could drop your sister off at a park but NOT get out of joining under the guise of ""Sister dates/ girl time""? That way he has no excuse to talk with you. Sister gets out of the car and walks over to you and you watch her walk back. No talking needed."
"Besides him being condescending, and it being alarming that he thinks he can make a huge decision like that for you, he's wrong.  Even at $27k/year, your take home pay is likely going to still be more than the yearly cost of child care.

So take a deep breath and text your wife; ""my abuser just died in prison and the name"".

Get your kids some extra support and find a way to tell them that a bad thing happened to you and you have scars hurting you on the inside.  

You can beat this.  You have survived worse.  Think of this as an extinction burst.  This PTSD flashback is a sudden and temporary increase in the pain and memories, followed by the eventual decline and extinction of the past pain.  You dealt with the pain you could as a child.  Now you are processing the leftover parts you couldn't deal with then, because YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH.

"The thing that jumped out at me is that if you change your name, it's going to make people curious and lead to conversations you may not want to have with friends, coworkers, etc. If people don't ask, it would probably be because they surmised that it was because you had a very dysfunctional relationship with one or both of your parents and don't want to have the same name as them. Maybe that history is something you'd rather keep to yourself?

"Oh wow something I know about!

My boyfriend is a huge Magic player and a level 2 judge. Magic takes a lot of his time. I'm much like your wife in that I don't have a lot of hobbies or friends and I am a homebody.

HOWEVER, I love when my boyfriend goes out to play Magic on Fridays. If he has a tournament to judge, or another event he wants to go to, he goes. I'm not his mommy. It's nice to have some alone time. I get to be home with my cat relaxing. This makes our relationship so much happier because we have lives outside of our connection to each other. It sounds like you're right on target when you say you are your wife's hobby, and that's not fair to you OR to her. You are not selfish. Neither is she, really. She seems lonely and doesn't seem to have much to do or the best coping mechanism for dealing with your absence. 

You really need to talk to her about relationship balance. Explain to her that you love her but everyone deserves to have something they enjoy. Ask her if she would like to try something new as a hobby, maybe offer to pay for her to take a fun crafting class or like a ""wine and design"" or find a local meetup with other women for pursuing an interest she has. You are going to resent her eventually if she doesn't let you pursue something you enjoy once or twice a week. 

I feel bad for your wife because it's clear she's lonely and projecting. She wants you to be around because she is lonely without you. She feels threatened by your hobby because it makes you happy and she wants to make you happy since you make her happy. But her treatment of you is unfair and needs to be dealt with. Try to figure out what upsets her. Don't try to have this conversation if she is already upset about it.

"While I agree that taking out a loan for a wedding is a bad idea, I agree with your fiance on the car thing. You said your car is about to die. I assume you bought it used and cheap. If you buy a brand new car from a dealership with a warranty, at least your ass will be covered for a few years. Taking out a car loan is an incredibly reasonable thing to do. 

If she gets to the end of that car note and immediately trades it in for another new car, she might look to leasing vehicles instead as she'll likely save money in the long run... But it is absolutely normal (especially since your fiance can afford it) to get a 5 year car note. My first note was a 6 year note because I wanted lower monthly payments. "

"&gt; If we talk, what do I say to her? We don't really have much of a relationship, just because of our age difference. I don't want to think I'm helping and instead make her uncomfortable.

My little sister and I have about the same age difference. When she was outed by our Mum (Mum went snooping and found letters from my sister and her gf), all hell broke loose. 

Make sure that your sister knows that you love her and that you will back her up *no matter the cost*. For my sister, I gave her someone to vent to and engaged the broken record defense 'I don't think who [sister] is attracted to is any of your business'. That worked for most of the problematic family members. For one uncle, however, I had to very loudly call him out during a family party. Basically, I called him a pervert who was a little too interested in my sister's sex life for my comfort. Surprisingly, he and I haven't talked since.

Good luck to you and your sister."

I really think that you need counseling, perhaps along with your wife, to work through this.

Also, seriously read through that link to the AMA of parents of disabled children. I don't have children or a pregnant wife and those comments made my heart sink. ""I wish he would die already.""

"Yep, this sort of cheater?  The ones who serially cheat in a shallow, churning way based on keeping secrets (and then getting angry about 'snooping')?

They won't stop, though they might white knuckle for a while about the cheating while being angry about how they feel instead of owning it and working to change themselves.

"She's trying to bait you into talking to her. I understand your concerns and that's exactly why she emailed you. However, if this was legit, you'd be getting a letter or subpeona from a lawyer. She just wants to hear from you. This is the equivalent of her saying I'm pregnant with no pregnancy test in hand or doctors papers and you jumping to paint the nursery, her exact intentions. For now, say nothing and wait for legitimate means of communication, if they ever come."
"Everybody on here is telling you to learn how to have an adult conversation, but nobody is explaining exactly what that entails. I thought you deserved a more detailed breakdown. 

Here's what works for me: 

1.) Be with someone who shows you in some way, on a consistent basis, as in daily, that they care for you. A hug. A kiss. ""Thank you for being in my life."" Doing chores without being asked. Bringing you a drink or a snack. Suggesting something fun to do. You, too, should be doing these little things. 

That way, when you communicate, you feel like you're talking to a friend who wants the best for you. 

You should also want the best for that person. Did you notice that bit where she said that she had to endure her brother screaming at her over some dinner? Did you not question what that was about? Is her family abusive? Do they scream at her and bully her or pressure her to always make plans with them? That would be kind of fucked up, right? 

That doesn't mean that you should never make plans with your family or otherwise have your needs met, but that was a golden opportunity to show some concern for her wellbeing. 

2.) Arguments and conflicts are best resolved by both people getting something they want. This is true in every walk of life, from business to international relations. Why should it be any less true with an intimate partner? 

The two of you are so wedded to winning arguments and defending yourselves that every discussion is guaranteed to be a fight. 

As long as you enter every discussion with the number 1 priority being winning, it will be terrible. Then if even you give in, you will feel like you lost and you will hold a grudge. Meanwhile, the other person won't necessarily notice that you have given in; they will simply be relieved that they won that particular battle. 

Did it ever occur to you to negotiate so that you both get what you want? 

With the Thanksgiving argument, the problem is not even complex! Every couple ever has to work that out. Spend Thanksgiving with your folks, and then let's go to mine the next day or next weekend. The next year, do it the other way around. There, was that rocket surgery? 

I mean, what did you do when you were a kid and your friend wanted to play baseball and you wanted to play soccer? Didn't you ever work these things out? Usually kids learn how to make simple deals starting at the ages of 6 or 7. Let's play baseball right now until these other kids have to go home and then we can play soccer. You did that plenty, didn't you? 

Do the same with your romantic partners. If you find yourself with somebody who refuses to budge on anything ever, which you should be able to see pretty fast, then that person is not someone you can be with. 

3.) Don't use absolute language like always or never. These are sweeping and harsh, and put the other person on the defensive. (You two do that a lot) 

4.) Don't talk about things outside of the discussion. If you're discussing what to do this weekend, ok, you can talk about last weekend because that may be relevant. But don't talk about last Easter, every Thanksgiving ever, what somebody said yesterday, the tone of voice in which they said it, etc. 

You two also do this a ton, and that guarantees that every discussion will be about everything that was ever a conflict. No wonder you two argue nonstop. You could be arguing about which cookie is best and it's guaranteed to degenerate into a rehash of every argument ever. 

5.) Couch things in terms of what you want or how you feel--what psychologists call ""I-statements."" 

For example, in the issues you are having with her, you could have said things like, 

-- I don't feel like driving down to (whereever) this weekend. I feel like relaxing at home. 

-- I really want to go to a family meal with my parents. 

-- I'm tired. I want to go to sleep now. 

-- When you raised your voice (an action the other person did), I felt sad and angry. Can we take a break and work this out after dinner? 

That last one is a basic template to follow: 

A. When you (a thing the person did). Make it objective and factual, not, ""When you get manipulative."" 

B.) How you felt. 

C.) What you would like to see happen. 

You both are full of accusations--you did this, well you did that. That's why everything is a big defensive argument. 

I urge you, right now, to Google *I statements*. I really liked the explanation found on a site called Compassion Coach. Their first step is **active listening**, which is a whole other thing you should look up and which you need to practice in abundance. 

6.) You might be an asshole. 

Always be humble. Review your own actions to see if you're doing the exact same thing you accuse the other person of doing, or if you're being out of line. 

Sometimes the other person was being a jerk, but you were being a jerk, too. You need to take responsibility for your own jerkiness. 

7.) Be as gentle and chill as possible with others. 

In both posts, you are hoping that we will agree with you and condemn your girlfriend as being a manipulative person so that you have permission to break up with her. Maybe she is a self centered, manipulative person, but honestly it's hard to tell because you both have this toxic behavior pattern of accusing each other. 

Tell me something. In your life, have you ever seen someone accuse another person of something, and the accused person immediately rolls over and says, ""You're right! I suck! Punish me!"" 

Be honest. That never works, does it? 

Here's an example. Let's say someone cuts me off in a long line at the store. 

**Wrong approach**: 

Me: Back off, asshole, I was here first! 

Result: I live in Los Angeles. Do that in the wrong neighborhood and you would be beaten or shot. 

**Correct Approach**: 

Me: Excuse me, I was in line. 

They: Sorry, I didn't see you. 

Me: No worries! 

Look what just happened. I stood up for my rights and the other person was fine with it because human beings have a sense of fair play. 

**TL;DR**: Study effective communication and nehotiation strategies. Listen to and care about other people. Fuck winning and dominating. Tell people how you feel and what you want. Focus on the issue at hand, not everything ever. Be humble and polite. "
"Get off Reddit and tell your wife NOW.

You don't have to be accusatory, but she needs to know what happened.

Frame it as an ""odd"" situation that you need help figuring out. Then see what your wife thinks and wants to do."
"Most states insist upon joint custody except in cases of abuse or neglect, and if they have joint custody and she makes more than he does, he will get some (probably only temporary, as a three-month period of unemployment is not likely to be considered him being a long-term SAHD) child support. The purpose of child support is so the child's standard of living does not decrease going from one house to the other (or decreases only minimally)

edit: Ok, I just read OP's history, and he describes himself as an on-and-off heroin addict. So....I take back everything I said about him getting joint custody. I am an attorney, but not a family attorney, and I just don't know how likely it is for a former heroin addict to get custody. "
Because she didn't think it would be a big deal.  People don't normally feel the need to have a big sit-down with their partners to suggest going to the doctor for a routine purpose.

Grandparents, if they have the least intuition, have picked up that *something* is wrong after that last horrible visit.  Might as well tell them the truth.  Maybe they can help out your sister.

"OK. As a person who is into weird porn herself, age play does NOT necessarily mean your wife is a pedophile, in fact she is unlikely to be. that said, I understand your concerns. Talk to her about it. I think it will be OK. All of that said, there is absolutely no reason for her to veto that costume for your poor son and his grandpa, if she associates that show with her weirdo fanfic smut (again, I can say this because I also read weirdo fanfic smut, just not that genre or fandom) that's her problem."
"Paragraphs 1-4 and 6 are irrelevant, sounds like things are actually pretty good with that. If you think you have a problem because of any of that, your GF is right that you're being selfish and you need to get over it. But, in paragraph 5, the part that starts with ""On top of that"" is where there is a potential problem. You two aren't spending as much quality time together during the week. You didn't give us a complete breakdown, but having all weekend together is still pretty good foundation. But, if during the time you do have together, she (or you) aren't actively working on the relationship, then that's a problem. It won't just work out naturally, you have to make time to do active listening with each other, discuss what's going on in your independently busy lives, to maintain a healthy connection. It sounds like she's fine with the way things are, so it's probably up to you to initiate getting things back on track."

Thank you also for your ~~generous~~ wedding gift which really makes your love for us crystal clear."" 



##Fixed it for u/AwfulMIL 
(you'll need to fix the grammar, though :)

"
"Nope. This is all inside your brain, and that's where you need to fix it.

ANY SPORT is going to be full of guys with great bodies, OP. If she went into soccer, if she decided she wanted to join a rowing team, or _god forbid_ she began practicing a traditional martial art! And most sports and fighting arts have a badly skewed ratio of men to women, so even if you convinced her to, say, take up pick-up basketball instead, she'd be one of a small handful of women.

 Either you can trust her to be loyal, or you can't--and if you can't, then it wouldn't matter if she was boxing or not, because it's not like she goes to a women's college with only female students and rides a women-only city bus and shops at female-only grocery stores, is it? Does she have to go to the library that only women can get a membership for? Is it acceptable for her to attend a co-ed laundromat?

This is part of dating someone so much younger than you at this stage in your life, OP; she's going to get to try a lot of new things and have a lot of new experiences, and they're not going to  have a lot to do with you. And they shouldn't. She's building a life, and it needs to be a strong, vibrant one regardless of your place in it.

And of all things to choose, boxing is an excellent decision. Boxing will make her faster, it will improve her reaction time in dangerous situations, it will strengthen her body and give her better zanshin.  Starting boxing will make her more likely to be able to protect herself in one of the damn-near inevitable bad situations she'll get into in the future.

""Saying something"" would be your effort to stuff her into a smaller life.  And you need to be a bigger man than that."
"Maybe if OP and this girl were both 10. He's 25, that's just weird. "
I mean like what the fuck? Seven times and it's a 'mistake'? You 'accidentally' cheated on your wife seven times? The lack of self awareness is killing me.
For my sister's wedding I was maid of honor and my bf was a groomsman. We did not walk down together. It really is no big deal. Walking down is such a short small thing in the grand scheme of things. Stand your ground. If she refuses well pick someone new for your bridal party.
"It's time to quit doubling down. You are wrong on this point (that you can go and it'll be NBD), but even if you weren't... this isn't insecurity your husband needs to get over. 

It's a number of variables that add up to a giant red flag. He has a right to be nervous, it's *reasonable* to be nervous, and it's clear from this thread most normal people feel the same."
This word is ridiculously overused.
"Nothing is going to be different if you get back together with him. This is a guy who lied to you about who he was to make you two seem more compatible, and waited until you were deep enough in the relationship to start doing all the things he said he didn't do. This will be what your relationship is going forward: a guy who lies to you then calls you a nag when you confront his lies. Don't torture yourself by staying in this relationship."
"You are in the wrong century.

You say there is an unhealthy cultural movement around a series of fictional books written by a woman who has donated the vast majority of her income to childrens' charities... but you're OK with your husband hitting your child.  And would ground your child an entire semester at a time.  

I'm done here.  I just can't.  

ETA:  Leave your children alone.  They're way, way, WAY better off.  "
"&gt;  Why would you not have ever made it clear that you are monogamous?

A mistake I will never make again I assure you.  Honestly I've never had to do this with anyone I've dated before.  I guess I live in a fantasy world.

I guess I am writing this a little to emotionless.  This has hurt, its hurt more than almost anything in my life (minus death of pet and grandparents).  Believe me at first I did everything in my power to try and get over this but since I have found out every time I see or talk to her that is all I can think about.  I have not been physical (read, no sex) since I found this out.  I can't, all I can do is see his stupid fucking face every time I see her now."
I suspect something like this. My dad left when I was young. After a certain point he tried to have contact but we have never had much of a relationship. He fucked up in pretty serious ways but I'm not angry (probably because I was young when it happened). I think he's ashamed and I think he believes that I hate or resent him. I should call him.

"If you drink, it can make you a lot less sensible about whether to take an Ambien.

If you take an Ambien, it can make you a lot less sensible about whether to drink.

It usually isn't people soberly and consciously deciding to take them both at the same time, they're usually addled by one and *then* consume the other. It's the same reason people on Ambien sometimes take more Ambien while not really coherent, which can be really dangerous."
"This is why we have privacy. Your girlfriend is not obligated to love your mother unconditionally, and everyone needs to vent frustrations sometimes. She obviously couldn't vent to you about this topic.

I know she gave you permission to read her private things, but this should be the time you learn not to snoop. She didn't do anything wrong, but now you are both going to feel bad because you went digging and didn't like what you saw. 

Also, we see failed relationships on here EVERY DAY because a boyfriend's mom or a mother in law is being controlling or bonkers and the boyfriend/husband won't stick up for his partner. If your mom is controlling, you are taking your mom's side, and you're snooping (which goes hand in hand with being controlling) then we call that a ""boyfriend problem"". "
"Not all PIs are former police, and it isn't known yet if the local department even knows that this is going on.

"I'm going to break your post down into 3 big concerns:  You, your wife, and the thong.

1)  You.  You messed you hugely here in trying to use your income against your wife.  That was way more than a ""low blow""-- it's a potentially trust-destroying blow.  It's the sort of thing that, said once, can make her wonder, ""does he secretly not respect me and not value any of the childrearing work I do?"" for the rest of the relationship and pervade everything.  Honestly, if my husband said that I would seriously consider leaving him.

To fix this, you need to go back and not just apologize and take it back, but go off on some really long raves about how much value she brings in caring for your daughter and how you can't live without her.  Don't just say you didn't mean it, dedicate a lot of time to making her _feel_ like she's really indispensible to the relationship.

2)  Her.  Like everyone else says, she needs hobbies other than your daughter.  Support her in this.  Maybe encourage her to take a ""personal hobby time"" budget to explicitly use on herself and not her daughter.

3)  Thongs and makeup.  To me, both of you are missing the point of this situation.  Your daughter went out and chose a sexualizing garment for herself.  There are a couple of possible reasons for this:

a - she's young and has no idea it's sexual, she just thinks it would be fun.  In this case, I actually don't think there's harm in letting her play with it.  Thongs are super uncomfortable, she'll probably move on to another toy soon.  Emphasizing that there's something wrong/shameful/inappropriate about an innocent toy selection is the sort of thing that makes a kid feel uncertain and ashamed for no reason.  Especially when...

b - to me, the real problem here is that you're raising a little girl in a society that is obsessed with sexualizing and visually objectifying girls.  It's tragic that, at 8 years old, she's being pulled into the world of makeup and thongs by the commercial world, not just because she's ""too young for sexuality"", but because it's such a tender age to already be told that her body is for display.

If it's possible, I would bring up your concern with your wife from this lens.  It elides a ""you're being puritan"" objection through a feminist argument:

""I want daughter to be able to make her own choices about clothes.  But she's just a little girl, and she's already being bombarded by stores and media with ideas about what her body should look like.  And it's only going to get worse as she gets older.

""If she decides she wants a thong, I want to make sure it's because it comes from a place of her actual desires, and not because she's being influenced by what someone else thinks she should look like.

""As her parents, I think it's really important for us to teach her she doesn't have to listen to those voices telling her to sexualize herself.  I want her to be strong in her own self-image.  That's really why I'm upset."""
"Honestly, I'm more inclined towards the opposite. USUALLY both people have something they're struggling with and the answer isn't as black and white as this new story. The last post was much more believable in that sense. She was unreasonable with her expectations for the in-laws (things her family does but are totally over the top), but he had no family boundaries (especially with his mother). They both had to give and take to make the relationship work and the comments reflected that. Here he is completely reasonable on his end (has apparently done next to nothing to provoke her) and ""My girlfriend HATES my family"" (clearly an irrational reaction to his lack of provocation). It just fires me up because instead of taking real advice, he comes across as a guy that wants the world to point at his gf and call her crazy."
"I mean, as long as abuse is a problem it's probably a good thing that people are concerned and on the lookout."

"Most kids dream of being a sports star, going pro, and making a ton of $$$. It isn't impossible, but there are very very few people who actually will break into the pro scene and fewer still who will get rich doing it. Even getting onto a college team is a long shot for most kids. There was a great article on Chris Hogan (Patriots WR who barely was nail a roster spot) that I wish I had a link to for you.

My brother-in-law played HS football. He's 34 now and his knees and back give him all kinds of trouble. That's just from HS and earlier low/non-contact football. It's difficult to imagine, when you're younger, but persistent pain from damage in your earlier years really freaking sucks.

That's even ignoring the concussion issue. As you get older, memory problems get pretty damn scary.

"I don't think it needs to be forceful; I don't think it needs to *be* period.  Frankly I agree with the people that say he's rushing things, but OP is happy to ignore those posts in favor of people who tell him the things he wants to hear.

I just don't think this child should be ""made to feel"" anything.  He should have a father who attempts to understand what he's going through and the fact that his life is turning upside down and tries to support him through the changes.  I don't think he should be trying to manipulate his child into accepting the new situation for the sake of his own convenience.  

I would feel differently if the child's responses were unreasonable and the timeline were stretched out, maybe, but this is a kid who's only had a year since the divorce to adjust to a new idea of normal, and there's no telling how long it took for them to establish the current arrangement as far as custody and whether the whole ordeal was smooth sailing or more turbulent and traumatic for a young child.  Rather than spending the limited time he gets with his child bonding with his son, OP is bringing in the new girlfriend and her children, and we know he isn't doing that for the sake of his son or what makes him happy or comfortable.

If I went to visit someone I care about and arrive to find they'd be inviting practical strangers to join us on every visit in the future and I wouldn't be thrilled, and I'm a grown adult.  Introducing them and letting them bond organically is one thing if the relationship is serious, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the son's bonding time with his actual parent."

I think her bf's other behaviors indicate that he is *clearly* an asshole, and I don't think you or anyone else should waste time defending him and implying that OP's vagina (and her face, and her attitude, and her humanity) are the problem."

Some cats are carriers and are symptom free for years... then suddenly tank on you, while other cats/kittens die within a few weeks of contact. 

I can't link in this sub but Google feline AIDS/leukemia for more info. Although, like I said before, it could likely be more related to neglect/ adopting kittens that are too young."

If you are set on this guy, you need to lay down the law with your folks. 

Asian parents have a hard time letting go, and you need to assert yourself and demonstrate that you don't care about their feelings, you are out to get yours.

You can't allow it to be whether *they* approve of *your* choices; it's if they keep criticizing you and interfering with your romantic life, *you* are going to cut *them* out of your life. 

Once your parents know they have no choice in the matter, they might just become nicer to your bf just to help keep you around. "

"Not if your one and only son turns out to be gay and his father is in denial so his son just avoids his father all together... Like my brother and father. Even if he has a child  that is a male, that child can turn out gay and more feminim than all of his daughters. "

I find it hard to believe anyone would sincerely believe it is good for a 15yo girl to meet up with an 18yo man who she has been chatting with on the internet. 

Idk, sorry, OP seems like a nice and genuine person - I don't wish to suggest she would be in danger. But I think meeting at those ages is ill-advised. "
"This needs to be way way higher up. Despite one of the major political parties nominating a guy with a sexual assault ""how-to"" guide, in actuality peeping tom voyeurism is illegal in most states (perhaps all states). OP needs to recognize that she is potentially in danger. She needs to go to the hardware store right now and buy a lock for her door and curtains. Both are easily installed and she shouldn't wait for the family to do it. I'd go for a chain lock for the door, and privacy film for the windows. The brand at Home Depot is called glissan I think, and you just stick it on. I'd do that in addition to curtains. She should keep the receipt and make the family pay for it. 

she should also reach out to her local au pair coordinator for support. That's what they're there for. 

Edit: I misunderstood, she's American and now in Italy. So not sure how much of this is applicable but in her shoes I'd try my best to mimic it. Does Italy have amazon deliveries? Gotta be able to order stuff online even if she can't get to a hardware store. "
Your relationship seems like a hideous train wreck based on a foundation of lies and deception. Other than that it seems ok.

"I am a lawyer.  no lawyer is going to take this case for free (unless you find a particularly charitable one).  Thus you will end up spending more in attorneys fees and filing fees than what the camera is likely worth.  Criminal charges are going to be your cheapest and most effective avenue here.  No guarantees that you will get it back if you press charges but certainly more cost effective than filing suit for civil theft.  If you don't feel comfortable getting the law involved I would wash your hands of this pastor and her family and call it tit for tat (free housing when you were 16 in exchange for your camera).  It sucks, but I don't see any other effective legal avenue here.  

edit: I have no idea what state you live in and I encourage you to talk to legal aid or get a free consult if you can, but that's just my two cents."
"She's 16 and probably still has the idiotic idea that she's a girl, so she can hit boys whenever she wants.  She needs to learn that when you hit someone, it's fair game for them to hit back. "

"My guess is that OP and her sister and parents are all on one group insurance plan. In that case, the plan covers all of the cars and people on it. OP is 17, a minor , and her sister is 20 but has been driving her car since 16. So her parents having the policy they are all on makes sense. OP stated she pays half of the insurance ( I believe )so her parents likely pay the other half. 
I'm curious about the accident itself, if another car was involved or if the sister totaled the car into something. ( like a wall, or spun off the road) if that's the case they may have avoided the police by just towing the car, and possibly the parents don't want to claim it on the insurance since the sisters multiple accidents had probably raised their rates pretty high, or on the edge on cancellation."
"I can see both sides. If someone did that to me, I would be mortified.  I don't like for people to think that I live in squalor, but I'm also not much of a deep cleaner. I do enough to keep the health department away, but don't look behind my sofa or under my bed.  If my friends saw my house at it's worst, I'd feel very embarrassed. 

However, if I'd just got home from a difficult month away, dealing with a death in the family, and quite probably a dead cat, it would be so nice to walk into a clean(er) house. Having to wade through cat hair and dust bunnies would just add to the sadness. So, I guess I could be pretty happy, too.  

You stayed out of the private areas, so I think you'll be okay.  If they seem upset, maybe you could tell them you dropped a cup of coffee or tea or whatever and once you started cleaning that up, you just kept going."

"I married a ""laid back"" guy who also wasn't a big planner. I always felt that I had to lead the relationship emotionally, as well. Mind you, he was good at planning a few things - such as moving from one city to another. But other than that, he left it all to me. We're divorced now. I got fed up with his passiveness and submissiveness and his inability to take charge. 

I'm a take charge woman and from the sound of it, you are, as well. What you want is a guy who is more of a go-getter than the one you're with. Your SO is just never going to be that guy. You will either have to accept that reality and be happy with with being the one in the relationship taking on the role of the pro-active planner, or you will have to find another guy who will display more traits of what you are looking for. 

You can't claim that you believe in equal partnership if you're still waiting for him to propose. That's not how true equality works. You still want traditional behavior from him. Historically, you have been the one to lead in the relationship. So accept that it will pretty much always be this way, or find someone who has a more aggressive approach to living a life on a planned timeline.

"Since so many others have addressed the red flags of how he approached the conversation, we can move on to one of the eternal hotspots of the Mommy Wars: SAHM vs. Working Mom. 

Yes, childcare costs can be astronomical. In my area, they can indeed run more than $27,000 a year per child, but the decision to work at that point is best considered based on both the tangible and intangible benefits of working versus staying home. What's the impact on long term earnings potential for either course? Would that make a difference in your long term financial security? What type of setup allows you to be happy, healthy, and invested in raising your child (ren)? Where do you find fulfillment? It's likely you won't know the answers right now or even when you have a kid. For me, this was/is an ongoing dialogue.

Parenting isn't about racking up credit for attendance, it's about creating an environment where parents &amp; kids are engaged, happy, and mentally healthy (among many aspects, so don't shoot me for over simplifying things). A SAH parent can be burnt out, disengaged, miserable, etc. if it turns out that he or she do not find fulfillment or enjoyment in the traditional household role.  Kids will internalize this type of emotional  static and it will shape them during their critical development periods. Having other people that you can consider part of your team, who DO find fulfillment in raising children, can be invaluable to your child's future. 

Childcare in situations where it costs more than you earn can be considered an investment in your family either through increased earnings potential down the road or in helping you find that mix of internal drivers that lets you be the best parent possible. 

Having stayed home for a while and then returning to the workforce out of pure necessity (my lesser income was still better than no income,) it was very apparent to me that I am a better parent for committing my workday to a cause bigger than myself or my family. I'm doing my part to help better the world for my kids.

All that being said, I'd suggest pre-marital counseling before tying the knot because there are obvious underlying communication issues co-mingled with your conflicting expectations. These don't magically resolve themselves.

"Have you ever met any 18 year olds? Or another person at all, actually? She likes validation. So does literally everyone else. I'm not saying what she is doing is cool, but it's not out of the ordinary for her age group at all. To diagnose her as a narcissist because she  sends short responses back to a dude who awkwardly flirts with her via meme is a gross mischaracterization of narcissism. "
"Am I the only one who doesn't think it's an issue if she uses the TV? I think splitting the cost of a TV is silly as it is, because people don't always move out at the same time, and if they do, there's 4 people and only 1 TV...usually for a used item this is more headache than it's worth. But it definitely does keep the costs down.

When I roomed with people, I didn't want a TV enough to buy it. If someone else did, then they bought their own. If they put it in a communal space, it was implied we all had the privilege of using it, given that we all contributed equally to electricity costs. 

Honestly I think it's incredibly petty of you guys to want to exclude her from TV privileges (*especially* if someone is already watching something). It sounds like you just don't like this girl and people are looking for a pretext to punish/exclude/ostracize her. It's not like *using* a TV like, significantly *wears it out*. It's literally what the TV is for. I don't understand what the cost to you is of her using the TV. And actually, since she's paying an equal share of electricity, you're sticking her with a higher bill. The 4 of you should grow up and realize that this is not a battle worth fighting...and that making your roommate feel so shitty is really not worth it."

"He's told you already: he's afraid of commitment. What that means is that you have no guarantee of further commitment from him. There is no guarantee he will ever move in with you and there is no guarantee of marriage from him.

And he refuses to set a timeline for when he'll know.

So you'll have to ask yourself. Are you willing to wait? For how long? Because if you want those things (which are reasonable), you are probably not going to get them from him.

It's time to think about what you need long term. If you need to live with someone and marriage, then you should break up. If you think you can live without those things, then continue in your relationship."

"You don't have to explain why you don't want it. It's enough that you don't want it. Also, you need to be consistent in refusing.

You are not entitled to their love. Figure out where you fucked up and fix yourself before your remaining daughter axes you from her life, too. 

Quit harassing your estranged daughter. She wants nothing to do with you. She is allowed to have that boundary. If you continue to disrespect and harass her, she will hopefully go to the police and take legal action against you.

"I have cut off contact with my own mother for many of the same reasons that you provide here. Like many here, your post strikes a chord with me as I face the possibility of my mother passing away. 

I don‚Äôt know the details of your situation, but for me, a situation that uses illness or impending doom to manipulate me and create a need for contact is something I have dealt with before. Also apologies. Like many who have already responded, this history would make it difficult for me to receive a ‚Äúend of life, clear my conscience‚Äù letter from my mother without feeling manipulated, confused, sad, angry, etc.

So, here‚Äôs my honest opinion. If there is some value to you in a last-effort to reach out, apologize, and potentially connect, do it. At this point, you cannot control how they react. You‚Äôre doing it for yourself. Acknowledge that.

1.	Don‚Äôt pressure or beg them to see you/contact you. Put the situation out there without expectations or emotional strings and let them do what they want to do. I.e., ‚ÄúI have received X diagnosis and am told that I have about 3 months left. In the time that I do have, I want to express to you that I take full responsibility for the many mistakes I have made as a parent and apologize for the negative impact my choices have had on your life. These things weigh heavily on me as I look back at my life and I do not want to go without extending to you a final, sincere apology for the things that I have done which have caused you physical and emotional harm.‚Äù

2.	Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt belabor individual points, apologize for specific actions while leaving out others, or get into justifications, ways you‚Äôve tried to make up for it, etc. I‚Äôm not saying those things aren‚Äôt true or part of your own story of how you deal with your choices/life, I‚Äôm saying that I feel sometimes that ‚Äúpackage‚Äù can be so emotionally burdensome that it defeats itself.

3.	I would not discuss what property you are leaving them. They‚Äôre going to find out once you‚Äôre gone and it comes to them. If you include that discussion, it will feel like (and be) an emotionally manipulative strategy to get what you want from them and it will likely taint the gesture that you are making by leaving them your property.

4.	Personally, I hate the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of who you‚Äôve become, I will always love you more deeply than you can ever imagine, you were always such a wonderful child‚Äù shtick, but, I mean, only you know if you‚Äôve overused that in the past. If you feel like you really want to say something like that, keep it to your feelings. ‚ÄúI want you to know that I love you.‚Äù Not ‚ÄúYou will never understand how much I care for you.‚Äù Not ‚ÄúNo matter if you ever speak to me again, I will still love you deeply.‚Äù Just own your own feelings &amp; let them have theirs!

They are adults &amp; probably not totally dumb, so they will realize that this is their final opportunity to connect, forgive, or receive some kind of closure. If they want that, they‚Äôll be able to figure it out.


Last, but not least, I know it‚Äôs probably tough, but with this gesture, let it go. Grant them the autonomy to make their own decisions, respect where they are, &amp; know that you did what you could to clear your conscience by offering a final, sincere, no-strings-attached apology. That is all you can do at this point to make amends, probably. 
Fill your remaining days with meaningful things that don‚Äôt involve your kids. I have a lot of complex emotions when it comes to my mother, but I would want her last days, with or without me, to be filled with clarity and peace. I would want her to do things that bring her joy and to find ways to fill her life with beauty, even if I don‚Äôt necessarily want to be part of that.

Eventually I came to understand on my own that people have different priorities and interests amd just because I view birthdays as majorly important and I would make a big deal for anyone's birthday, doesn't mean that they feel the same way and will reciprocate. I decided that my friends were all around decent people whose lives are now different in comparison to mine (as opposed to when we were all in high school and had the same schedules, same homework and similar commitments), and now I just don't make too big a deal out of it. 

My advice to you is to stay out of it. Let her come to the conclusion about her group of friends on her own. Maybe your group is like mine, and are decent people with different priorities, or they are actually inconsiderate  idk. But that's for her to figure out on her own. Just be the good friend you already are and hang out with her when you can :)"
"Take care of the dog. It's not worth the risk that she might be neglected. Leave the asshole brother to feed himself. That is just ridiculous. 

Honestly. I'd have a long talk with your mother that you are happy to protect the dog from him but he's an adult and you are not his parent. So you refuse to parent a grown ass man. And don't ask again. "

"I think you're missing the point of my question, which makes me think that (as someone else mentioned above) you're probably missing the point of the conflict with him too."
"You had an argument that you even admit wasn't over something serious and you packed up your things and left? That would be a deal-breaker in most relationships. He may not be able to overlook how you were able to throw the relationship away so easily as though he didn't matter to you. Look into why you did that, what you were trying to accomplish and whether that's a healthy dynamic for you. "
"Without knowing your mate-seeking strategy it's hard to advise you. As a 20 year old girl (I'm a bit older now but I was 20 pretty recently) I had no problem finding guys who want a relationship. Guys around my age at that. The thing is I just don't meet people at parties and i never directly sought out relationships. I meet people in class or in clubs then I make friends with them. Guy friends. I hung out with them platonically and eventually one of them always emerges as relationship material (not all of them. If they bail after a certain time you know what they wanted from you. Some do stick around though, even when it becomes clear you will never be together. Those you will get to keep as friends) By that time we'd have the emotional connection down too. I never met any of them in clubs and I *certainly* did not have sex with any of them before there was an emotional connection (through friendship). So before we got together we already sort of love each other. That's huge.

I'm not saying mine is the only way to a relationship but it's one way. And watch out for ""guy friends"" who just try to get into your pants and aggressively flirt with you. They will never be open to true friendship or emotional connection. Cut them loose and move on. Lots of fish so to speak."

"Yeah, I think I should start with trying to get her to see the need to see a specialist for the sleepwalking. That might open the door to more conversations about her mental health.

I have looked her ex up on Facebook. He has pretty much everything set to private but then I found him on Instagram, which was public. He has a girlfriend now it appears, he seems to be busy with his own life, traveling, concerts, and... eating? (He is a huge guy, he takes a lot of pictures of how much he has to eat. Lol.)

So no obvious signs he's still hung up on and stalking Lilly, but if he is a stalker, he's obviously much smarter than posting anything on social media about it. So besides the insane waves of murderous rage he invokes in me because of what he did to Lilly, I found nothing obviously strange about him.

Thanks for the comment and advice!"
"Like a decorative bag? Because people definitely think those two are interchangeable and that's acceptable.

I don't know... a grown man should know that an iron isn't romantic. But I could easily be convinced that he thought it was thoughtful.

How else did he treat you on your birthday? Was it all about you? Was he especially loving? Where was his focus?"
"I agree with this in principle, but in this case it's clear her behavior upset all of her children pretty badly, and that's a problem on its face.


This might be how she sees it though, especially if she's only been drinking that heavily for a few weeks - she might be thinking it isn't a big deal, she used to get much more wasted in college, this is her way of coping with what's going on with her right now/having fun/whatever, and doesn't realize it's affecting her children as badly as it is.


If so it would be a good thing for OP to talk with her, and make her understand how upsetting it is for OP and siblings to see her this way. *They* aren't college kids or peers who enjoy drinking and routinely hang around drunk people and know how to handle them after all. And she isn't their friend or drinking buddy or someone you'd expect to help out when they're super drunk, she's their mother, the person they look up to to be responsible, to look after them, to be a rock."
It's funny you mention that because that's exactly what I was considering today! I think I will because they really are the type to waltz in any time and I mean any time! 
"Well, you can kiss that money goodbye. Obviously she's never had any intention of paying you back. I'd break up. But just never buy her gifts or dinner or anything until you reach that $500 mark. Every time she asks or gets mad, just tell her why you are doing it. "
"""Just don't have anxiety"" doesn't work as a way to stop having anxiety, unfortunately."
"I have similar feelings about my hair.

When I was small, I had VERY long hair. Like down to my waist. I always remember hating it.

ALWAYS.

I have Aspergers (not diagnosed til my 20s) and my sensory issues were worse when I was small. I *hated* everyone always wanting to touch and brush and braid My Pretty Hair ¬Æ. Often, it hurt. 

It was dry and fine and hot and I hated dealing with it. It never looked right and as a teen when everyone was getting cute bobs or layers, mine just laid there like a horse's ass, or was a frizz bomb, or if I used anything to manage the frizz, it looked like it hadn't been washed since I was 10.

I also just never felt it suited me. I was never the type of girl or young woman to want to spend hours on My Pretty Hair. It wasn't pretty to ME. 

When I was 19, I cut it. Short. Like short short. Boy short. It's been that way since. I am NEVER growing it out again. Ever. I finally LIKE my hair. And oddly, I still get told my hair is pretty, and I have a cool cut, and what a beautiful color. 

Not all people, men or women, will like short hair on a lady. And that's ok. Having a preference is ok. Whether it's skinny or curvy, or short hair or long, or brown hair or blue eyes. All ok to like a certain thing over certain other things. 

It's even fine to suggest a change, when possible. ""I really like long hair, ever consider growing yours out?"" ""No, I like it this way."" ""Ok"" AND THEN DROP IT. OR decide its a dealbreaker. It's not ok to continue to badger and manipulate someone to look how you think they should look.

I had a guy tell me once ""Maybe you would have better luck with men if you grew your hair out"". I said ""Maybe you would have better luck with women if you weren't an intrusive ass who gave unsolicited advice"".

It is YOUR hair and YOUR reasons. Your BF can fuck right off."
"Tell your parents. ""Mom, Dad, I am 14. I saved up and worked hard so I could afford Sister's wedding invitations as a gift to her. Now she says I can't come to the wedding because Fianc√© doesn't like me. That's fine, but I want her to refund me the money for the invitations. I bought them under the impression that one of those invites was for ME. Seeing as how they are not, I want my money back. I have no intention of paying for part of a wedding I am not invited to."""

"I think you got married way too young.

It's strange that you want to dump your *wife* over just 6 months of having a hard time because of her mental illness. It's strange to me that you did not anticipate that a person with a mental illness will fall into these negative spirals (you can literally read all about in on Wikipedia) once in a while, wherein being with them will become very hard. It's strange to me that your wife changing - we all change - comes as a surprise to you. 

You come off as the asshole here, but this is just one aspect and I won't judge. I will only say that, at 22, most people are not ready for the commitment that is marriage, and you clearly didn't grow into it either. I don't know if that's something I can blame you for, or your wife. More like, this whole thing has been a terrible mistake, and cleaning up this mess, especially from your wife's side, as this relationship is clearly affecting her self-esteem, will be a long and laborious process. I can only encourage you to have compassion for her as well as for yourself as you sort out where this is going."
"&gt; And isn't it common decency to not leech rides off your coworkers?

"My partner just received news he's gotten into the top medical school in our country with a huge scholarship. He's going to be an incredible doctor and it's something we worked together on for a long time. I'm unbelievably proud of him, and us as a unit for getting here. I know in my heart things will only continue to improve with him at my side, and me at his."
"&gt; That being said: If he takes on the lion's share of expenses, please, please, please show your appreciation to him. Thank him, cook him a nice meal every so often if you have the chance. You shouldn't feel insecure whatsoever, but despite the income disparity, try to contribute to the relationship as equally as you can

But don't become a slave to him because you make less money than he does.  Don't let him be the boss of everything because he has more income.  Money doesn't buy power in a healthy relationship."
"I don't see any evidence of him giving it a second thought. In any office I've worked in (even in larger departments), this would be all anyone talked about at the beginning of the work day. Everyone would express concern for Edith, talk about how sad it is, then get back to work. OP skipped that whole part and didn't seem to give it a second thought at all. I believe this response gave the coworkers the idea that he didn't care, which lead to the confrontation. If he had expressed any sympathy from the beginning, I'm confident they wouldn't have confronted him in that way. 

You're right about this only being one exchange. I can't imagine this is the only time OP has acted outside of social norms. That sort of thing is noticed. "

Yeah she literally said that's just how she feels and she's entitled to feeling that way.

"Did you remind her that this was one of your accommodations when  you asked for the extension? I get several of these letters every semester, and I glance over them, but expect a student to remind me if they want to take advantage of an accommodation other than extended time for tests, since others are rarely used. I've honestly never seen extensions for assignments listed on a letter, so it's possible she didn't realize this was one of your accommodations."
"Sorry, I could have used better phrasing than survive. By survive I meant that this could happen and our lives wouldn't change. 

To be fair I probably am pretty out of touch on most things (For example my son is obsessed with pewdepie and I honestly don't understand it lol), but I am aware that we are very fortunate, and I didn't intend for it to come off that I think we are struggling."
"That reminds me of a story my aunt told me about going to Rome when she was in college. She was talking to the innkeeper's wife one day and said something along the lines of how everyone must be very devout since they live so near the Vatican City, and the innkeeper's wife just sort of dismissively waved her hand and said, ""We have the Pope, that is enough religion for us."""
"&gt;I told him I thought we should wait maybe another 6 months to a year.
We have definitely, 100% talked about this. I told him my concerns, and he agreed and said he understands and its no problem

did you not read this part? yeah, she said she'd be happy with a baby but she also made it clear she does not want to try for one because its not the right time. Do you really think the husband is confused and thinks she actually wants him to impregnate her? Who cares what her stance was a year ago when they've had multiple conversations since then.

&gt;Like I've said in my other comments, she told him to pull out while she was ovulating

no she didn't. she said ""I suggested that for the time being, he should just pull out every time in addition to my likely monitoring when I'll most likely ovulate and not have sex then."". She wants him to always pull out, AND she wants them to avoid sex whatsoever while she's ovulating. She is clearly trying to avoid pregnancy, which she has discussed with him. And she says they are avoiding having sex while she's ovulating which clearly implies that shes keeping track of it, she doesn't need to explain every step shes taking. Idk how you can defend this guy. "
"&gt;a breakup can be used as grave consequences

What the hell?  She doesn't have a RIGHT to this relationship.  If she doesn't like it, she can leave. 

Edit - though I do agree that this relationship should die, because he _shouldn't_ trust her at all, rather than just setting the terms so that is a little harder for her to cheat. "
I cannot believe that you are putting equal blame on the child victim of physical and emotional abuse as you are the parent who tried literally **nothing** to protect the child from abuse they knew was happening. Sickening.
"She literally went to the doctor to ask if the amount she drank and urinated was normal and the doctor said it was perfectly fine...  
  Her bf had a urine play fetish kinda deal, there was no hydration tracker and she didn't drink too much water?"
"I'm not saying she's guiltless, and having an affair with a married person is a shitty thing to do, but I think the politician is much more at fault here.  He took advantage of a young girl working for him.  And interning for a politician isn't a sign of immense maturity--politicians are always looking for interns for cheap or free labor since they're typically not paid and do it purely to put on their resume or are paid very little."
I told him over the phone that I'm glad he's alright. Of course I'm glad that he's not dead... but i just feel so weird about it all that I don't know what to do.
"Husband problem, which is even worse :/"
"25 years ago I was him. My SO was you. 

Really, very similar indeed.

She left me. Politely, kindly, no screaming or blame, but absolutely final. 

I have never blamed her, she did the right thing. Bipolar is appallingly tough on the partner. Sometimes even strong love is not sufficient to make it work. Your mental health is also important. You are not a mental health professional, or a professional carer. This is not your job. Do not sacrifice the best years of your life for someone who may never appreciate it, or get better. Nobody can blame you for this. 

TLDR: Leave. You will get your life back. He'll survive. "
"No she doesn't know about my past insecurities about my weight. It was my first time meeting her when she said all that. She is also a dancer, so obviously in a very good shape (ego got bruised?)

My boyfriend told her twice to never make those tinder comments again. I told her once (when she did it the second time round). She was very sorry and promised the both of us to never do it again

Yes there will be other friends and relatives. However she is the only friend who got invited in their circle of friends

He has other female friends, all of whom i have absolutely no beef with 
"
"You're right, he's going to kill you. He knows perfectly well what he's doing. He does not lack self awareness. He's deliberately hurting you and it will get worse.

Take pictures of those bruises, and talk to a police officer. Filing charges might get you enough time to GTFO and be safely away from him. get a new lease somewhere else (don't forget that roommates are a thing) break the lease and don't look back.

Talk to your friends who have witnessed the abuse and ask them for their help and support during this time. It's a lot easier to get away from  a violent thug when they've got witnesses."
"I mean . . . sounds like you're having cybersex and maybe even mutual masturbation. He's pressuring you into going further, and dangling something you want (a relationship) out in front of it. Sounds like an asshole move and a person you don't want to trust. I'd cut contact ASAP."
"Most people miss this one - if something isn't working, try doing it differently. And talking about it. Lots of couples will keep silently banging their heads against the same wall until the relationship is dead and buried. Good for you for shaking out something workable."
I can honestly understand why he is pissed. Andy definitely could have picked a better time. Doing it right before his little brothers tournament is a little rude. 
"Well, she doesn't have nothing to lose. She obviously wants this move. Even if she is not 100% it sounds like she's upset at your attitude. Honestly from my perspective it does sound like you are being a bit dismissive. Maybe because you two have been arguing and you're already wound up... but you seem set on the fact that you're right and she's wrong. That might well be true, but that's only going to antagonise the discussion. Hopefully you are really listening to her, validating her. I do understand your frustration. At the end of the day this is one of those difficult roadblocks that couples come up against. Sometimes you just want different things. And even if she just considers this and then realises she'd rather stay here, it's that fully fleshed out consideration into the new option that helps solidify any decisions going forward. All the best."
It is cruel to give people hope and then take that hope away from them at the last minute at the expense of your own siblings life. 
I would not bother confronting Rita. Let the big bad police handle the investigation.
". Maybe it's the region I live in, because I've seen your question in this thread a few times..but my friends, family, former boyfriends we've all asked each other to watch X while we step away for a few minutes. It's very common here. It could be a southern thing? I've never had a problem watching an item for someone while they step away to use the restroom, it makes it easier for them. 

He doesn't talk about his job much besides just complaining about his work load and some of the people he works with. He doesn't go into much detail about why his work load is so high, and just complains that his coworkers are idiots, but doesn't talk about why they suck at their job. "
"I totally agree this is WAY overboard. Its not like you slip and get pregnant. As long as OPs girlfriend is diligent about the pill then it should all be fine.

Same with me -- Except for the first few months, I've only every used hormonal BC, never had a pregnancy scare."

"I think the point is that when asked if there was anything specific they might have said that could be conceived as crossing a line, they replied with a phrase that's shorthand for intentionally being an arsehole and theatrically not caring if it bothers anyone.

How did you go about telling her she was overweight?
"Please do not think that. Her emotional and mental health is her responsibility and hers only. Please don't ever stay in a relationship because you are afraid of what the person might do. That is abusive to you.

If you want to break up with her and you genuinely fear she may hurt herself, you are welcome to tell a close family member or friend to keep an eye on her. If she makes threats of hurting herself, **call the police.**

Until then, she needs to help herself emotionally. What is she doing? Does she go to therapy? 

People in relationships need to be a couple and an individual at the same time. She needs to have a life outside of you and find comfort in herself."

"OP, if you find yourself tempted to ""help him through this difficult time"" because ""you can guide him through his addiction"" or some equivalent codependent urge, I recommend reading the following books by Pia Mellody:

* Facing Codependence

* Facing Love Addiction

* The Intimacy Theory

I struggled for most of my young adult life (19-23) with heavily codependent relationships (including with an addict...but his vice was Rx pills, not alcohol). DO NOT GO DOWN THIS PATH. /u/rrrents is absolutely right. 

This advice goes for ANYONE thinking of/already in a relationship where they are saving a wounded baby bird from something (themselves, addiction, mental illness, etc). Please read the above books and make sure you have appropriate boundaries. Recognizing I was codependent and going to therapy to learn proper boundaries made my life so, so much better."

"The reason why he doesn't want to tell you, is because he is uncomfortable with it. Masturbation can be a very private activity.

There are soooo many other things that are important to be open about."

"Are you kidding? I married into a family that is literally WASPier than the House of Windsor (bunch of Hanoverians that they are), and my husband is Long WASPy Name IV, and our son is Long WASPy Name V. Technically, yeah, only royalty gets the Roman numerals and among the common folk, only the living people of that name are supposed to count (so my husband would be WASP Jr. and our son would be WASP III), but whatever. This is very common among a certain type and class of UMC boarding-school-attending family. 

You don't go around introducing your kid as James IV. ""This is our son, James."" My FIL, husband, and son all go by different versions of their common name and it is absolutely no kind of big deal at all. It is a total nonissue. 

He absolutely should have told you about his preference well before now, but I'm confused as to how this tradition eluded you. Also: if James wasn't a legacy name, would you have any objection to it? My husband's name isn't my favorite - actually, I'd have preferred James, but that's his brother's name and would have been weird - but it's perfectly fine, passes the Chief Justice test with flying colors, and is not a name that I disliked a lot for its own sake.

"&gt;I hate them both and everything they symbolises. 

Well, then, why the fuck do you think your sister should ask your  opinion on the matter?

Your sister is not you, and she's allowed to make her own choices.

Like it or not, son, these are your siblings.  Maybe you never have anything to do with them, ever. That's your choice, and the fact that I think your life will be lessened by the lack of them certainly shouldn't be required to have an effect on you. But you need to leave your full-sister alone about the fact that she wants to know _all_ her family.

&gt;I'm not happy and I don't know what to do

You stop blaming little kids for the fact that your parents divorced.  From what you're saying, your mom didn't even cheat on your dad!

Maybe you see about talking to your mom.

Certainly you talk to your dad, too, about how you're feeling, and what he did to get done being angry himself.
And honestly, see about getting some therapy.  This sort of rage is acidic, and will only eat you up.

As an afterthought...you hate everything they symbolize? What they symbolize, from this distance, is that there's life to be had even when what you thought was your forever-relationship breaks down.  What they symbolize is that people are capable of love.

Frankly, even if they were children of infidelity, what they'd symbolize then is that even something as nasty as cheating can have a silver lining.

And beyond all of that, they aren't symbols at all. They are people. They are the people who will go down in history as being your brother and sister, when the family trees are written in thirty years you'll be on them even if you never spoke to them face to face. When your great-great-grandkids are looking up their ancestors, they're going to see those names, they're going to wonder about them.  They're going to think _how sad, that Great-Great-Grandpa was so angry over something as common as his parents divorcing that he denied himself the chance to have more family._"

"I do think she's held on to this a bit long, but I'm going to go against the grain here and understand your wife's position. It's not really about YOU - it's about her security. It gives her a sense of control. She has no control over you or what you choose to do. She CAN control what happens if you do it again. If it were about you, she'd be holding it over your head, but I think the fact that you didn't even know about it shows that it's completely about her insecurity and needing to feel like there is something she can control. I think for the most part she probably does trust you on a day-to-day basis. She's worried she'll move on, get ""too comfortable,"" and it will happen again. She's afraid to let herself be vulnerable to that. That being said, she HAS held on to it for too long if the relationship is to last, and hopefully counseling can help.


How do you approach the conversation (which was your actual question)? You could try framing it as an attempt to give HER peace of mind, though she may deny that she needs any. You could approach it as a favor to you, something that YOU need in order to live in the ""new reality"" and she'd be helping you out by going, though that may only work if she's the sort of person to want to help someone (you) out. You could also ask her to go to learn how to manage your marriage for the sake of your daughter. Without knowing her and what kind of person she is it's hard to know what would work, but if she doesn't see the need for counseling, you need to get her in the door. The counselor, if s/he knows what's going on, can then hopefully get her to see that she needs to stay.


Good luck! I hope you both find a way to heal and move on."
"A lot of business school activities do revolve around alcohol and meeting up at bars.  That said, it's not that hard to drink in moderation or decline with the excuse that you need to stay sober for something later.  I think the bigger issue, as OP acknowledges, is that he didn't really want to be spending the evening this way, and the alcohol combined with frustration that he was doing her a favor and she couldn't even be bothered to show him the basic appreciation of not wasting more of his time than necessary.  Doesn't mean he could've tried harder to set it aside until they could discuss it sober, or that there's not a bigger drinking problem at work, but she should start by committing to change the things she knows are an issue on her end and go from there."

"&gt;I don't want him to get away thinking he did nothing wrong and that he did this for the benefit of our relationship. He seems to think if he didnt do it now it would cause problems later on when we started a family and how this was the perfect timing.

Okay so this isn't as big a deal as you think it is.

What I mean is, he *knows* he did something wrong already. You don't need to feel crazy and feel like you have to make him see reason -- he's not an idiot (or at least not that much of one), the only reason he's saying these things is because he's trying to *manipulate* you into believing the lie -- the lie that he did nothing wrong and that it's totally fair for him to do that to you. But he knows it's a lie. You're the one he's trying to trick.

I know the feeling of ""is this person crazy or not, I want them to understand that they did something wrong so I don't feel crazy too"" but seriously, he really does know. He knows how much it cost him and what he did wrong. He's just trying to manipulate and push his way back into your life again so he doesn't have to feel like a fuck up. If he didn't feel like a massive fuck up, he wouldn't have contacted you this way, or maybe at all.

You don't need to talk to him. It's been 7 months. Trying to talk to someone that gives *so* little of a shit about you and make them *see* just how much pain they've caused you... it won't work and isn't really worth the effort, at all. Think about it. Him caring now, requires him having empathy for you at all. But if he had empathy, he wouldn't have tried to string you along like that. Empathy is the prerequisite.

It's not your fault. It's not that you need to prove that hurting you is wrong. It's that there's something wrong with *him*. You can't explain him into being a decent human being. It's not that he can't see reason, it's that he doesn't care about hurting you. Which means it's not about you, but about how awful he is. You don't have anything to prove -- you don't deserve what he did to you, and the only way to prove that is not to talk to him, but to continue cutting him out of your life like you have been.

He thought he could get away with hurting you, and he just didn't care about your feelings at all. I'm sorry about how much that sucks. But just realize that truth -- he knew he was wrong, he knew it would hurt you, he knew it would ruin everything, but he didn't *care*. You can't talk him into caring now, he never had the empathy to care in the first place.

So take care of yourself and don't bother with him again. The kindest thing you can do for yourself is to not argue about whether or not his treatment was okay. It's not up for debate at all. Don't let him debate it. That you deserve kindness and compassion is a given. You don't need to convince him that it's true."

He doesn't know *anything* about how women's bodies work so I doubt the sexual encounter would be very good anyway.

"At 20 the age difference matters. Think of it like this. How would you feel dating a 10 year old? Even if they were really mature and grown up for their age? What if he was closer to your age, say 15, would you date him and go to his high school to pick him up? I hope you can see how it's weird.

I'm not saying you're immature or dumb, you are just inexperienced. You'll get that experience when you go through your 20's. 

Dealing with his daughter will be a problem. She may not be thrilled either. And if he is a half way decent person he will care more about what she thinks than what you think."

"First thing's first: It sounds like the two of you are fundamentally incompatible. Your culture is important to you, and given the nature of Judaism, there is some mixing of the cultural and religious aspects of your background. Conversely, your BF is staunchly against any and all things religious. If this relationship plays out, very likely one of you two will be unhappy: Either you will give up your Jewish culture, or your BF will feel forced to embrace Jewish culture.

That said, there is a bigger issue: Your boyfriend is an immature asshole.

Your boyfriend is perfectly entitled to be atheist. That said, there is a huge difference between being an atheist and disrespecting others' cultures. I'm sure you don't go around to non-Jewish people going ""Your religion is stupid. If you were intelligent you'd be Jewish like me."" That's exactly what your boyfriend is doing with his atheism.

Not only that, but he's shown complete disrespect for you as a person. Your cultural background is important to you, and he threw a tantrum because you took part in it. You had dinner and he threw a fit. Even then, if you did go to temple, why does it matter? It's not like you dragged him with you and he still was pissy. Furthermore, your boyfriend feels entitled to have you change who you are to suit his wants. If he doesn't want to date someone with religious ties, that's his own right. However, he doesn't get the right who does have those ties and demand they change for him. I highly doubt your Jewish background as a well kept secret, and he still started dating you expecting you to change to suit his wants.

When it comes to multicultural relationships, it's perfectly normal to come from different cultures and respect each other. I'm atheist and Asian, and I've been in relationships with people from other religious and ethnic backgrounds. I respect their beliefs and background, they respect mine. When it comes to the topic of kids, we'd discuss mixing the two and letting them figure things out for themselves. At no point in any of my relationships did we:

* Say that the other person's culture was stupid
* Disallow hypothetical future kids from partaking in our partners' cultural events 
* Throw tantrums because the other person took part in their own heritage

Dump the giant baby and find someone who respects you as a person."
"Exactly.

And you know what, even if it were a wash financially, and OP has made it clear that it is hugely important to her to continue working, and not just because of dollars and cents.

If you want to play this really sensitively, first of all make sure she is interested in a relationship, and then suggest you both jointly break it to his family in person, out of respect.   You could even ask for their blessing (nb: not permission).

But don't for a second believe T would have wanted you both to be alone and miserable for the rest of your lives.  This outcome will have him grinning broadly in the afterlife (if there is one)."

If he still refuses to talk about it then just say no worries but assure him that if he needs to talk about anything you'll always be there to listen. As a follow-up you could even suggest catching up outside of work on the weekend, or talk about something you're really looking forward to and would like him to join you for.

After this convo do what sofunny has suggested and act normal, and maybe invite him to more events/outings than usual. Letting him know that you noticed he was down and that you care about his wellbeing is important, not just for him but for you. I've certainly appreciated the gesture in the past and have had people say the same to me.

"Having friends over, hanging out with friends, or pretty much any plans should be discussed regardless of marriage.  I wouldn't say ""ask permission"" because that implies that one person controls the relationship.  I'd view it more as running it past the other person to see how they felt about it and to check for possible plans from the partner.  Gender roles are irrelevant to the situation, too, so it's not that the guy should always check with the gal or vice versa, but rather both should run such plans by the other person just in case there was a conflict of interest.  That's basic respect and courtesy."
I'm sorry :/ not all girls are like that. Hopefully you'll find a more mature woman next time. Also I commend you on standing up for yourself and getting yourself out. No one should have to be in danger from the person who's supposed to love them. I'm really sorry you had to go through that.

"Damn, that was one crappy romantic weekend.  If you and she make it long term, maybe in 20 years or so ya'll will be able to laugh about it. Maybe in a month or so you could plan a romantic getaway weekend that doesn't include double stacking up with either your family or her friends.  Or better yet, maybe *she* could plan a romantic weekend just for the two of you."

I don't think you should be worried. She just wants to have fun with other girls. It's perfectly normal. You guys are young and this is what some young people like to do. 
"That's how I have been trying to think of her. Honestly it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  But, like I said in the original post, I think about 'her' a lot less, see some of her faults that I refused to see in the relationship, that kind of stuff. And yea, she did not trade up or anything, this dude is a train wreck.

"Really, each person gets to choose what they are and aren't comfortable with. You can suggest it, and if he says no, there's really not much more you can do.

It's okay for your husband to be okay with only girls. It's also okay for you to be okay with only guys. I think this is a pretty common configuration in relationships, which resolves to no extra guys or girls joining in.

It's okay for you to want the rules to be open. If you two are going to have threeways with other women, you also want to be able to have threeways with other men. I think sometimes people get too preoccupied with whether something is 'even' and don't spend enough time thinking about if it makes everyone happy.

It's okay to hope that he'll become okay with bringing a guy in, but please realize that he might not ever become okay with that, and you need to make peace with that for your own benefit."

"My BIL did this once when I was visiting. He was really drunk and got out of bed and thought he walked to the bathroom. He really did think he was peeing in the toilet.

The next day he was mortified, it was out of character and happened after a really big night while we were visiting.

If this is the first time this has happened then it is really not a huge deal. Embarrassing and worth an apology to your mom for cleaning it up and he should get her a new handbag, but not something worthy of calling the police.

Why was your mom's first reaction to this to call the cops? It seems like a grossly exaggerated reaction if this is the first time this has happened.  Frankly it sounds like your mom is looking for grounds for a divorce that she can point to that no one will deny.

This is not that event."

Having said that, current gf is going over the top with such an ultimatum and its a red flag for your relationship dynamic. "

"You said ""I'm not having sex before marriage"".  He is refusing to see you to hang out unless you sleep with him.  That's pressure.  He engages in sexual discussions with you and won't talk about anything else.  THAT is sexual pressure.

He's 33.  He knows what he is doing, and he is deliberately pressuring you.  

If you don't believe me and you want to see what kind of man he truly is, tell him that you are interested in dating him, but you are not going to sleep with him, and in order to see if he values you for anything other than sex he needs to never bring up sex again. A man who respects you would either shut up about sex and date you, or be honest enough to say ""we're not compatible, we should move on"".  He's not a good man and he doesn't respect you."
That is great.  Keep the communication up between the both of you.  I made the mistake of burying my feelings and not communicating well with my wife.  Best of luck.

edit: I feel like this came off wrong and I sound like an ass. It's not that I don't want to hang out with her (obviously) I just don't want it to be something we schedule, I feel like that would just stress her out more and make our hanging out feel obligatory. "

There's lots of things to consider with career vs stay at home, and ""what are we going to do when we have kids?"" is a question that must be answered before getting married. "
"I am the fat daughter of a first generation Asian mother. Growing up, I was slightly large like you, I was a size 8 up to college, ballooned to a size 10 in college, and am now a size 12/14 in my thirties. Throughout it all, I was always compared to my thinner sister, and my mom never stopped trying to get me to lose weight, except for a brief period of 3 years when I was a size 6. The heavier I got, the worse the criticism. The breaking point was when my sister told her that she would lose me if she couldn't shut up about my weight, and she said that she would rather damage our relationship if it would get me skinny than have a fat daughter. I stopped talking to her except minimally for two years and our relationship was never the same. This was hard because I was her favorite child growing up (despite the weight). 

Eventually, she did shut up about my weight because I would immediately shut down when she brought it up. My confidence also improved, and I also started dating my thin fiance who turned out to be her kryptonite. She didn't want to point out that I was fat (as if he didn't have eyes to see it himself), in case he would figure out I was fat and leave. It made no sense, but when he was around, she would never say anything. Even when the comments stopped (both in front of my fianc√© and when I was by myself), my anger and hurt prevented us from having a relationship. Our relationship improved when my grandfather died and I realized life is short, so I've begun to forgive her.

Based on my experience, if she is causing you this much anxiety, I say take a break from her. Shut down the conversation when she brings up your weight and refuse to answer her calls for a while. She will get the message that if she wants a relationship with you, then your weight is not up for discussion. Either she values your relationship enough to pipe down, or she doesn't, meaning it's not worth it to have a relationship with her. Good luck, OP."
"""I asked her what she thought of me applying just to see what would happen, and she told me to go for it, but she wasn't moving.""

Great, so what's the question? She told you straight up, that you are free to do what is best for you and what you want, but that she's not coming with you. Why did you expect her to just change her mind once you got the job? Based on your comments, you just wanted people to tell you that you are in the right and she is wrong. Well you are in the wrong here. You couldn't pay me to live in Texas, especially if I was used to living in California."
Uuuummmmmm what the hell is wrong with your friend
"Agree to it... on the condition that she doesn't get pregnant before *your* wedding.

After all, you don't want her focussing too much on being a mother instead of your wedding preperations, and you don't want her to steal the limelight from your big day. 

Maybe that would make her see how ridiculous her demand is. "

"And don't let him tell you that you are overreacting/it's just Facebook/""I sent her a friend request, I didn't CHEAT"" etc.

"Bahahaha.

You're fine, hon.  Hold your line and do NOT budge for these people.  You're being incredibly generous by offering to let her live with you at all.  If she doesn't want to follow those arrangements then she can make her own.  Surely this flock of vultures wouldn't want her NOT making her own decisions, right?  Maybe you could point that out to them.  That if she doesn't want to come live with you, you can't force her, but that you can't give up your job and your life to care for her- that isn't your responsibility.  You didn't give birth to your mother lol.  "
"that...is fucking crazy. As I commented above, if something like this *accidentally* happened to me and my husband I would probably die laughing, but to do it on purpose sounds so unbelievably unpleasant."
"You don't sound like a good thing for either of these girls. You sound a bit judgemental, selfish and shallow.

You're emotionally cheating on your current girlfriend. If she really know that you've confessed your love for your ex and not only is she still dating you, she's actually posting online about how much she loves you, then she's probably quite vulnerable and will be damaged by the fall out.

As for your ex, you seem to be one of these dicks who think that they know best for their partner, and 'if only they live their life the way you've told them then all your problems will go away.'

Get over yourself and let these girls go. Do something that's in someone elses best interest for once. "
I can afford it myself as it is but I'd rather save up the money I'm making right now. 
"No. This is not normal. Your mom and sister are completely under-reacting. His behavior towards you was (from the very start) and continues to be *extremely* inappropriate. That is not ""fatherly love"" and if I were you, I wouldn't let him anywhere near your daughter. "
"I mean, she hasn't exactly shown good judgement. How much trust can you put in an unofficial handshake agreement that she is going to remain amicable forever and you will always get to see him?

You have been his father for 8 years. If you don't adopt him, you have zero legal rights. If he gets hurt, you have no rights to go see him in the hospital. She can leave the state, leave the country with him. She can simply unilaterally decide you can't see him anymore. If heaven forbid something happens to her, if she goes off the rails and becomes a drug addict, joins a cult, passes away, anything, you have no rights to take him out of the situation. 

If you adopt, as his legal father if your life is stable you will assuredly get 50/50 custody from the courts if you ask for it. If both of you are sharing custody and your incomes are similar, child support is not going to be much. If she makes more you might be the one getting support.

"I want to add onto this by saying that there are many things that OP could and really should do to reestablish trust and help him get through his hurt. These include things like being more transparent about her whereabouts, letting him check her devices if he gets suspicious, and being willing to discuss the infidelity and hear about how she hurt him without shutting down or getting defensive. She should also take full responsibility for what she did rather than just blaming the alcohol (which it sounds like she still is). 

HOWEVER...

Letting him finish in her mouth after anal sex is not something that she has to or even should do to try to fix things. Letting him turn their sex life into something that she doesn't like or isn't what she wants all the time isn't something that she has to do or even should do. They need to actually address this. OP isn't obligated to let him act out his revenge sex fantasies, and doing so isn't actually rebuilding trust or helping them heal his hurt. It's just feeding his anger."

"Seconded. If this had been a post about getting married at 22, it'd be a different kettle of fish - but a long engagement until you guys are 25+ sounds very sensible. You currently live together, are you in further education or do you both work? Do you live near your families, or are you at a respectable distance from them?

 What you might be starting to experience now is a twofold panic of friends and acquaintances showing their true colours. Obviously, it's normal for people who love you to ask if you are both sure if this is what you want, what your long term plans are, etc .... but friends, even family members who won't listen to you or come out of the corner swinging with ""you're too young!"" are just showing you that they don't want you to change because they can't/won't be able to take advantage of you anymore. And this can be from something so silly as ""stealing"" either you or your fianc√©e away from them, or even you two wanting to financially prioritise each other above other people (say, if you guys go out and buy the occasional round of drinks). 

I will say this, and maybe some redditors will be able to attest with their own experiences: something happens when you put a ring on your fianc√©es finger. People change almost overnight. Some overzealous friends, acquaintances and family members suddenly become more vocal about dictating what you should do with your lives and how you should do it - and often it's the people you just don't expect. It sounds like you both have healthy relationships with your families respectively, but as an example - my MIL revealed herself to be a manipulative, selfish and kniving person . She tried to take over the wedding planning, she tried to uninvite my family guests and she said and did a whole bunch of other innapropriate things. She was absolutely lovely before we got engaged but once the ring was on my finger - BAM! Monster in law. Some of my husbands friends were like that too ... they didn't like the fact that he has decided he wanted to focus on making a life with me and they started to behave in a really nasty way to him.

We had a year engagement after knowing each other for 6 years, and still people revealed their true colours the moment we got engaged. We had a lot of support from friends and family, but it was unnecessary stress leading up to the wedding that ultimately taught us who we wanted in our lives and who we didn't.

If we had had a longer engagement, as you two plan on having, I'm certain things would have been easier to cope with. 

OP you sound very sensible, and I think you and your fianc√©e should make your plans prioritising your life together continuing as you are. It sounds like the people in your life that matter are listening to you and supporting you, so it's probably best to take the panic criticism with a pinch of salt.

All the best x"
"Just a friendly heads up

&gt;after some issues it was open or leave

Opening up a relationship that's having issues is more-or-less universally considered to be an ""Oh shit, bad idea! Don't do that!"" in the swinging/poly communities.

"I disagree that this is *exactly* like refusing anal. They're totally different in my opinion. For starters, both partners can give and receive oral without much difficulty or preparation.

"My stepmom isn't half as bad as OP's wife and she's still managed to drive a bigger wedge in between my dad and I. Really, I don't like her.

My dad and I didn't have a stellar relationship before my stepmom, so for OP's daughter to still be so open with her dad means she must think he was a hell of a dad. He's going to blow it completely if he doesn't get his head out of his ass about how absurd his wife is being. He's risking a lot more than being uncomfortable at his daughter's wedding.

If Lydia isn't allowed over to his house then I'm guessing Lydia won't allow Barbara at her own home either. Where does he go to see her future children? Surely Barbara is going to throw a shit-fit when he tries to go without her. It'll be a bigger blow out when she realizes that Lydia isn't going to let her kids over with her unsupervised.

Polyamory shouldn't be a work-around to a problem. The core problem is one of communication and trust. With polyamory you have to be even better at communicating opening and honestly. He has desires that ultimately he should have communicated with his partner instead of sneaking around. Even after he was outed he continued to go outside of the boundaries of their relationship for gratification. Even opening the relationship might end up with him pushing boundaries that get set and continuing to spoil their relationship. They need to work on that aspect first - he can control himself long enough to get their relationship on track and discuss solutions to their long term happiness. It's not going to be a simple solution to open the relationship if this is still hanging over their heads. 
"Yes, good advice. Her reaction will tell you all you need to know and help you make up your mind about your future together."
"Follow your gut. There are reasons why you feel so uncomfortable around him now. Those feelings are valid and warranted.

OP, please tell your mom. She's there to protect you. If you feel uncomfortable doing that, then go to teachers, counselors, or coaches you trust. The worst thing you could do is keep it a secret."
Yup and can just use the crazy fan line when someone says he's cheating on fianc√© who he has already chose over op. 
Wow. Your husband is about as defective as it's possible to get. I would put money on him being the root cause of your anxiety.
"I did this to my husband for a while (then boyfriend), this was years ago. I had a lot of unsorted feelings about our relationship and a ton of personal issues (insecurity, anxiety and depression), and when I got drunk, they came out amplified. I usually either blacked out or only remembered bits and pieces. The next day I was always mortified.

After a particularly bad episode, and knowing that I would eventually ruin the relationship if I continued my behavior, I enacted two safeguards. First, I wrote a note to myself and gave it to my husband. I told him to give me that note if I'm having a drunk angry episode. It was basically me telling myself to chill the fuck out, stop taking my issues out on him, go home and go to sleep. Second, and more importantly, I stopped drinking for a while. I might have one glass of something occasionally, but I steered very clear of getting drunk or even buzzed. For about 2 years my alcohol consumption dropped off steeply. That said, he never had to use the note because after that point, I never drank enough for it to be necessary.

After around two years had passed, I found I was able to drink again without being abusive. I still engage in bad behaviors when I drink to excess- that hasn't changed (I get lost, I am totally helpless, I'm a complete idiot) so I avoid overdrinking like the plague BUT at least the abusive tendencies went away. 

It is hard to quit or almost entirely quit drinking when you're young and your friends drink, it's what everyone does to have fun, but it's really necessary. If she isn't willing to quit or majorly cut back for you, she isn't prepared to do what it takes to salvage the relationship."

"Yes, look for someone in administration to address this with. If he is the graduate coordinator and you won an award, he may have been sent the folder of photos from the photographer and been asked to help select one to use on a slideshow or in a brochure for a graduate event. If this is the case, he will likely have some record in his email of being asked or of telling someone else the date he would send them a selection by. 

Let's hope it is that nicer option and not due to an attraction. Either way, administration rather than peers or other professors are still the people best equipped to handle this. Find your school's Title IX coordinator; they are equipped to help students in any cases involving sexual harassment. They know the other administrators so they would be able to contact the proper people to find out if this has just been a misunderstanding, and if this is more serious, they would be the ones working with you."

Giving up is sooo easy, isn't it? I hope that you can have a heart-to-heart conversation with her and get her the help she clearly needs. 


All the things you described could be an indicator of depression. It sucks, but she is in it now. You have the means to help her, so do so!"
"It is very upsetting, but CPS and the SRO have been notified and will likely take action soon. I'm content to let the authorities handle it from this point. Thank you for your concern."
I don't see how my wallpapers are tasteless or cringey. I would agree if I worked in an office with other people but this is my personnel PC that I built for the sole purpose of gaming/programming that is in my home.
"I'm a straight woman so I may be off the mark, but to be fair, I imagine that no oral sex in a lesbian relationship is probably more akin to no PIV in a hetero relationship than just the absence of ""one sex act.""  Everyone is entitled to their own boundaries regardless of their orientation, but I hardly think this constitutes an issue on OP's part."
"I was wondering the same. I couldn't really tell, because she said ""he can still"" not that he does. So does she have them? Or he has them? Or she thinks they are at risk for them?

/u/ohneeei, can you explain what you meant? "
"This kind of ignores the fact that after therapy she has changed her behaviour. 

I don't know if she does love the OP nor do you. She says she now does and that before she didn't know what love meant or how to express it. Do we think real love is like in movies? It's not, there are doubts, problems and complications.

I think we all know real lasting love is different, that it's commitment to each other and takes effort. She failed for a long time but after therapy she has changed. I think we need to acknowledge that. I don't get the impression she is along for the safe ride and security anymore.

My advice to the op would be to insist on a joint therapy session. This needs to be worked on together. You need to communicate, she failed to tell you the truth for seven years, don't do the same. Tell her how this has affected you. Another thought exercise is that if she had told you then, what would you have done? Demanded therapy? What would have made you felt like she had learned to love you? Reverting back to how she behaved in the early courting days?"
"Everyone wants to work it out at first.

But seriously, this is a loosing battle. She WILL cheat again. This is way to similar to my ex-wife.

Best of luck mate."
"A ""few more rounds""? What is this a porno? Twice in three hours is plenty for most guys. 


I think you just need to explain that you not wanting to have sex 5 times in XX hours isn't you not being attracted to her. Some people connect you getting hard and being able to climax to how attractive you think they are, and it's a flawed premise. Sounds like you guys have an extremely healthy sex life, and honestly maybe offer to help her out in other ways if she wants to keep going? "
"&gt; However he is convinced that I take her word as law even though I asked him if I did take her word as law, why am I still sitting here?

That's what we want to know. Why are you still sitting there instead of packing your bags and calling for movers?"
"Anyone who could do that, idgaf about their problems "
Why is he so reticent to defend his own son's right to happiness?  
"hey, for the record i think half your income is crazy. but i work for a community action agency (working with the homeless) and the best things sometimes for us is private donors. for things that maybe we didn't get a grant for or for our big dream things, or more money for services that are in high demand. Our executive director and our financial department meets with these donors and basically say what kind of thing do you want your money to go to? We ask them what kind of a role they want to play (it's great when they want to be there at events where they can see all the people they're helping) ((and it's extra rare when those folks want to get their hands dirty too)). That'd be the way to go if you ask me! "
"If Bob and Gary are normal people without anger problems, Bob would laugh and say ""You wish bub!"" and they would sip their beers. "
"Just a reminder, this is probably the best way to go about it, but you will still end up hurting her quite a bit. I don't think there is a way to go about this where you won't."
You're her backup plan. You deserve better than that. 
"You do realize that access to abortion is actually super important, even for women who ""don't care at all"" about politics, right? Like, it directly affects us. You mentioned never wanting to get married, do you ever want children? Because accidents happen. "
"He's not dead, but the other guy he punched through a car window is. 
Think about that. The guy might've slept off his drunkenness in his car, he might've driven drunk and killed himself either way, but by going there and attacking him with two friends, your boyfriend ensured that he would drive drunk. And now he's dead.  

Dump him, what a thug."
"Tell them clearly ""I love my name, Katelyn, and I'd like to be called it. I understand you're used to calling me Katie and it will take you a bit of time to get used to it, but this means a lot to me, and I know you care about me enough to make that effort.""  

and then stop answering to Katie. Introduce yourself as Katelyn. If anyone introduces you as Katie, politely correct them. If anyone calls out ""Hey Katie!"", ignore them. People who care about you will listen to your preference and call you what you have asked to be called. People who don't care about your desires will be forced to call you Katelyn when you don't answer to anything else.  "
Is no one going to ask where the hell she is getting dead rats???
"&gt;so I think for an otherwise liberal guy he's got a pretty bad view of women and sex. 

Yeah, about that.  Liberal men can be--and often are!--just as misogynistic as conservative men.  They just know how to use the language of liberalism and social justice to pretty it up a bit.

Dump this motherfucker."
"You don't instill values into your children? You don't teach them what's right and wrong?

I wasn't sitting at the dinner table telling them liars are worse than genocide, slavery and global warming. Just like you weren't sitting at a dinner table telling everyone how you hate murders, and rapists. Some things don't need to be said so upfront.

How would they know? Because there were multiple ""friends"" of mine that I had cut all contact with because they had lied to me. When asked why, I informed them."
"So most people don't include things like the time it takes to get ready and commute in their working hour count. A 9 hour day including all of that is **light**. A 20 minute drive is basically the minimum commute time in my experience. I have many friends who commute about an hour and a half each way. Then a 9-6 job. Then cooking dinner after that. Then miscellaneous things like cleaning. That's a normal schedule where I'm from, and according to you, it'd be a 13-14 hour day. That's part of being an adult, there's really no avoiding it.

The reason that people are having trouble being on your side with this is that this is something we **all** deal with. No one wants to take extra time doing chores. The time you're spending on taking care of your household is a really reasonable amount. I think you need to accept the fact that you're an adult, even if you don't want to be."
"Damn dude, I guess nobody on Reddit listens to Drake lmao "
