"If having sex with other people gets you excited but having sex with him doesn't, I think his heart is going to break. I do not see a good outcome for this at all."
"You are a fool, especially for turning down the South Africa trip. She needs to go, and you need to live your life for you. She's as brat and you're enabling her. Why the hell does she expect you to pay for her flights? And you're 40 and can't leave your gf for 1 week?? Grow up man."
"While I largely agree with the other comments that this girl is not actually intentionally trying to ruin your engagement - I think there's probably a liiiittle truth to it. But what you should recognize is that most of it is not shitty behavior specifically directed at YOU, but just sorta like, everyone - imagine her as a shit garden sprinkler, okay? Poop in every direction. It hits everyone. So of course it hits you, and of course she's shitty to her own fiance, and I bet other people too - but it's not really specifically aimed at YOU. Even though her comments are indeed very hurtful.

Honestly - you cannot stop him. Especially because this isn't even your brother. Your fiance should tell his brother that you two have his back and that if he wants to talk about his options and what being in a healthy relationship is like, you two are here anytime - but you cannot MAKE him leave her, it just doesn't work like that. You in the meantime, keep taking the high road. Be polite to her. Be polite to everyone else in the family. 

Also, this is very important - don't tell her anything about the wedding and don't let anyone else tell her about the wedding. Keep very mum on the details. That way she cannot copy your and/or tell people your ideas are terrible. Just keep quiet, plan your wedding, support you brother-in-law, and learn how to deal with shitty people.  "
"An affair with a younger women who works under you is a common way to cheat.  He most likely is cheating in this situation.  

Sit down with him, and talk about it.  Find out if he's unhappy with your relationship, if he's lost romantic feelings for you, or if he just wants to sleep around.  Find his motives.  

You have been together 7 years, he may have lost feelings for you and wants to pursue another.  You need to decide if you still want to be with him, or you can give him a hall pass.  Your choice."
"All girls like teddy bears no matter the age. Shows empathy and that you care rather it be your sister/significant other! Go for it! good move little bro, maybe some flowers with it. Either way great job to be there for your sis!
"
"Mine too. I sold my WRX when I was pregnant with my second, and cried on the way home in my practical station wagon. I can't imagine what I would do if I had to trade *that* in for a family land yacht with no manual. Rending of garments, probably.

The last time I snuggled a newborn, however, I found a brand if car seat that claims you can fit three across the back of a Toyota Matrix. So I guess there's hope? And also, I shouldn't be allowed to hold babies anymore..."
"&gt; My husband however, thinks I owe it to them to hire them. M

lol, no, plus it is a really bad idea

your husband can start his own business and hire them"
"Clearly marriage is important to OP, and that's reason enough."
"Pffft, hiring friends, relatives, and/or neighbors is a minefield. I wouldn't recommend it if they were rockstars! What if his sister screws something up, how on earth are you supposed to address it without it being weird at Thanksgiving? What if your neighbor wants a raise you can't give and is bothering you about it while moving the lawn or whatever?? Dual relationships are a bad idea, full stop.

Asking you to put yourself in that position is super shitty of him. I would flatly state that you do not hire anyone with whom you have another relationship - it's not good for either party."
"Gosh, I really just can't figure out why women don't want to be around you, you seem delightful. Not subjugating half the population of the earth is not about getting you ""respect"" from women, it's about acknowledging that women are human beings irrespective of whether any of them are actively doing anything for you.

And I don't believe that ""respect"" is what you're after, given that you've already stated multiple times in this thread that women afford you basic respect already and you don't find that sufficient.

Why don't you work on becoming someone that women would *want* to spend time around, rather than an embittered, entitled boy, and see how far that gets you. Women are not ever going to want to spend significant time around someone who sees them as a walking pussy with no redeeming qualities. That attitude is your biggest roadblock. Stop focusing so much on what you want/can get/feel you deserve from women, and how angry you are about not getting it.

"
"There is never a time you ""should"" want sex. You should only be touched sexually with your consent. You do not need to feel you should want all sexual advances. You can even say no to your SO that you love if you aren't into it at that time. There is literally never a time I can think of that you are required to want sex or sexual advances. And certainly never against your enthusiastic consent. "
You must know some real losers if you think that's the case
"&gt; I'm really scared he might drive over to my dorm.

Send him one text message saying you need space. No more after that. If he does come over, call the police and tell them you are afraid of your angry bf and he's on his way over."
"Happy wife, happy life? I disagree. A wife's happiness shouldn't come at the cost of a husband's misery. If talking it out has failed, perhaps it's time to see a marriage counselor."
"&gt; Or she'll send me instagram stuff of food/burgers, but I would usually be like ""that's not how it's done"", or ""that beef looks completely dry"" or ""been there done that"", something like that.

LOL ok. I know some people are really super fucking pretentious but this sentence set off my troll alarm..."
"Have a cop explain that to her.

She is already old enough to be charged. 14 is well over the age of reason."
Even if it's just to say thank you for the support :) 
"&gt;I did not cheat or even come close but in his head, it is almost as if I did.

That's because IT WAS CHEATING TO HIM, that's what you don't understand. YOU don't think it's cheating but HE does. "
"Yeah, that's also completely different.  We weren't given the same things every single meal forever, and my parents were very aware of watching for allergies, etc.  Sorry you went through that."
"I'm not really afraid of 'losing' my wife -- I don't think what she did was acceptable, and she seems to agree that attempting to effect a reconcilitation on a Sunday morning. Who in their right mind would think that was wise? I get where my wife's heart is at; but, unfortunately, she had seemingly locked her brain somewhere else.

It's not like my parents or I have failed to tell her exactly what she's done. Audrey thinks that if I can get over this and move past it, that baggage won't affect out daughter and she can have the benefits of cousins that she (as of right know) will never get to know. 

I don't carry this around like a weight. It happened and I'm perfectly fine on a day-to-day without them in my life. The problem is, this has become intrusive and as much as Lisa is sorry, I'm not really all that sorry for her. I feel like my sisters attempting to get back into my life is more about them than it is about me and is a way for them to feel better about the situation. I am not a charity case and don't need friends because they feel some sort of misplaced guilt.  

 "
"The problem is that they didn't take cues from my parents. They didn't stay neutral, they befriended and were sisterly with Lisa -- they would do things together that excluded me. After the admission, my eldest sister went to my parents to get me to talk to her -- I think it was to help her cleanse herself of guilt, not because she had any real interest (at the time) in getting to know me. I feel like I've been an interesting person (I jointed the army, went to university &amp; law school, have an interesting job, etc) and only now is she at all interested -- which is fine, but where had she been *before* that? 

Can I forgive the other two? Sure. But, right now, I am the one who gets to be angry, and I get to decide if/when. They don't get to work with my wife behind my back. My older sister's visit was idiotic. Moreover, don't speak to me in my parent's language as a way to feign some connection. We're strangers who happen to share a genetic background. "
"Why do you keep saying boring.

She has a high libido dude, she's not a fucking XMen character."
I wouldn't hold anything against the BIL (yet).  Sounds like he came into the picture after the schism.  He may not know what is actually going on.  His wife (OP's sister) could have omitted a lot of details about why there is a divide between them.
"&gt; I'm sure Audrey was doing it from a good place

I politely disagree. Your wife assumes she knows better than you do about your own trauma. That's arrogance. She needs to sit this one out and support whatever you choose to do."
"It works with dogs, too."
"The other thing is that I KNOW my mom will never leave my dad. She is independent in her life and he constantly put her down if she buys ANYTHING (groceries, a new shirt, etc.), so she is frustrated a lot by him. But at the same time, she does not believe in divorce and believes that he proves her with financial security so he can treat her however he pleases. This saddens me to no end and I try to encourage/stick up for her as much as I can, but I never really get through. Also, I don't think they have sex anymore. They don't sleep in the same bed. "
"My sis was taken on a 3-5 day vacation *without* our parents when she was 3 and she was traumatized by that experience because she thought she was being taken away from her parents (my mom was against her going too but this was one of those insistent MIL situations). She cried and was upset/sad for a good chunk of the vacation with her aunts/grandparents.

Also I remember when my cousin's kid was on vacation with grandparents only (no parents) and he was upset missing his dad (he once mistook the back of my dad's head as his own dad, and when my dad turned around he burst into tears).

Taking young children away from their parents for even a week just seems too cruel to the child, who would rather be with their parents than on ""vacation"" with grandparents.

"
Cheaters are only going to cheat with someone willing. It always takes two. 
"Never too early for a kid to learn that you don't always get what you want.  Jane should be encouraging that lesson, not trying to encourage everyone else to spoil her daughter."
"Municipal sewer systems are really only meant to handle bodily waste and toilet paper, which is specifically designed to break down quickly. That's *it*. 

Tampons, ""flushable"" wipes, condoms, etc get caught on things and gum up the works all the time. "
Or just skip any sort of legal advice subs on reddit cause they're all trash and consult a real lawyer. 
He's a dirtbag and put instant gratification over your emotional health.
"So not yourself or your wife *personally*?

If you **made a promise not to tell** because it would be too difficult to talk about if it goes south (and let me remind you it did, five out of five times), are you advocating breaking a promise because you're ""so excited""? You honestly ""*don't see any problem*"" with that?

You know what, if the miscarriage did happen, at that point yes, I could understand the husband telling his family for support. 

That is not the situation here. He sent out a group text message to spread the news very early for the wife before they were out of the woods. 

But I'm soooo glad you know better than everyone else because you haven't actually had to experience it first hand. "
Buy better condoms and use them properly as the odds of them breaking twice should be near 0. Pills can cause a huge amount of side effects so get over your fear and dont be cheap. 
"&gt; It sounds like I only want to hear a certain set of answers, eh?

Yes. You are being incredibly selfish by not telling her. Cyber sex is also cheating. Stop. Right now."
"Yeah - don't go down that road. If your wife is talking about burner phones, don't indulge her byi going down the cold-war spy-novel lane, because that just feeds her paranoia.

Make it clear to her that you cannot prove a non-event. Also, don't give her permanent access to your email and accounts unless that was already your custom before, as it changes the balance of power in the relationship in an unhealthy way.
"
"she was not Islamophobic, she did not make any mistakes. "
"If this is how you think of women (and also of yourself), it's no wonder you've never had a date."
"Oh my goodness thank you. One of the more annoying parts of this sub is how often people are encouraged to break up over issues that are so small. And the advice is always like the above commenter, some vague ""this can't be the only issue, your SO is clearly insane."" There is no reason for you to be downvotes "
"Yeah, married. Sorry. Well done on picking it up."
"Google ""fantasy-prone personality."" Your girlfriend sounds a lot like my aunt, who also believed a lot of the woo-woo stuff. FPPs often believe the things they say because they tend to blur the lines between fantasy and reality. They're not crazy--my aunt was a successful, hard-edged businesswoman. She also believed she could remember her past lives, communicate with spirits, and a bunch of other wild stuff. If you could find it in the New Age section in the bookstore, she believed it. It's entirely possible your girlfriend is picking up this info by talking to people but also genuinely believes in her own psychic powers--that she's not doing it maliciously or to be deliberately fraudulent.

Nonetheless, I don't blame you for being pissed. This would probably be a deal-breaker for me. I just wanted to give you a different possible perspective on her personality and motives."
"Closure is a myth. Or, put another way, he needs to figure out his own closure, because you've already closed things. He's just trying to get back in contact so he can persuade you out of your own feelings and decisions. 

If you haven't already, send him one message through an email address he already knows. Tell him not to contact you again. I mean, he already knows this, but you're just making a paper trail in case you want to get a restraining order. Otherwise, be boring. If you pick up the phone the 100th time he calls, he'll call you 100 times to talk to you again.

None of this reflects on you. He hid his toxicity semi-well (aside from the test at the beginning, wtf) but after 4mos he couldn't deal with the blows to his ego. He feels like less of a man because you're better at taking down Joker's minions? That's his issue, not yours. And he's got some gross ideas about sex, too.

I'm also a gamer, and a woman, and I enjoy sex, and you know what? My boyfriend, who shares my hobbies, doesn't care how good I am at Overwatch or Mass Effect as long as we can have fun in multiplayer. And he likes that I like sex with him. Healthy people want to have sex with partners who enthusiastically consent! 

You are cool. Surround yourself with people who are happy you're who you are and don't want to mold you into some two-dimensional shadow of yourself that exists solely to soothe injured self-esteem. Your ex can get a body pillow for that."
"As a Dutchmen reading this I get incredibly annoyed by the boyfriend and this very American attitude of being so reliant on cars. 


I would only *start considering* going by car if the point I was going to was more than half an hour by bicycle (8km or 5 freedum units). 


Going by car for something within *5 minutes walking* distance? Absolute heresy in my book. "
That's not how regret works.
"Yeah, this shit happens to a lot of people regardless of when they marry. Earlier marriages may be more ""risky"" statistically, but marrying later is no guarantee. People can surprise you even after their brains are ""done."""
"I read somewhere that attempted strangulation is the highest indicator that the offending partner will kill the other. Best of luck OP, leave now and take care of yourself. There's better people out there that will meet your needs without hurting you - but the prerequisite is that they respect you and your safety.
Edit: just realised I'm echoing /u/KyrieEleison, I'm still learning the ropes."
"This isn't entirely true. 

There are Open meetings that welcome both alcoholics and non, but (generally) only alcoholics are allowed to speak or make comments at them. 

Usually these are larger meetings where loved ones can attend to show support early in recovery and sometimes celebrate milestones (coins) with the alcoholic. "
"Honestly, before giving an ultimatum about your relationship like the above poster said (which isn't bad advice, it's just no fun if you love her), I'd give an ultimatum about the booze. Tell her everything the OP said, but replace the end with ""if you continue bringing alcohol in the house, I'm going to start getting it out of the house and the only one wasting their money will be you"". Then buy a BB gun and use her unsolicited gifts as target practice if it ever happens again. Hell, invite her along, it might be a nice symbolic gesture for both of you, and it's pretty fun to shoot full bottles tbh. Hopefully that'll send the message the first time. And if it doesn't, then it's time to take a serious look at the relationship. 

Sometimes the only way to show someone they're being ridiculous is to do something ridiculous. Harmless and fun, but ridiculous"
"&gt; I have a background in IT and she doesn't know much about phones or computers so I know shes clean on FB/Text/any other apps due to me checking with her permission.

Do you really have her permission? Or does she let you send texts from her phone and leaves her Facebook signed in, so you just *assumed* you have blanket permission to snoop through everything whenever you want? That sounds an awful lot like ""I'm monitoring all her communications."" Or are you just reading her texts to ""check for viruses""?

Regardless - those types of test can be routine with a pap smear. Or maybe she's thinking about becoming pregnant. Maybe she thinks YOU are cheating on her. 

The job complaint thing isn't strange. They could have gone through some organizational changes recently that made her work life hell. "
"I can see that, until OP made it clear she found the accusations offensive.  

Now it is about him not being empathetic, caring or respectful of what that accusation *means to her*.



"
"Don't make someone else your priority when you are not theirs.  She wants to bang others guilt free, and you are causing to her to feel guilty because you are not participating."
My immediate thought was that he used some different kind of soap. Some of those generic soaps have a latex-y/chemical-y smell and taste. 
"This is what i was thinking. OP sounds pretty certain she correctly interpreted the noise he made, but he's denying that's what it meant. I wonder if in the discussions she's been trying to have, she goes in still telling him how he felt that night, instead of listening to him saying that he wanted her to go on with the threesome.

Of course, it's possible that he really was bothered by it, to any extent. But if he's saying she should've gone on with it, it's not unreasonable to assume he wanted her to continue still. It has nothing to really do with it being his fetish. She's insisting he wasn't okay with it, he's insisting he was."
"Op said in a comment that she only gets to see their common friends every couple years, on special occasions. Otherwise she's home with the kids."
"I'm just going to focus on this because there are enough people advising you on your main question. 

You dropped out of school so he could have somewhere to live? Have you continued your education in some other form? If not then, what? Did he pressure you? If he did then that's one of the most selfish things I have ever heard. It's not just shortening  an education, it's decreasing opportunities in later life. Opportunities as in actual jobs that you won't hate, that have a MASSIVE impact on your life. I just can't believe that you felt you had to give up something that is so important in he long term for something so small in the short term. 

A **normal** (not good, but normal) partner would encourage you to do what's best for you, not what's best for them. As someone 3 years older, he should know dropping out is a bad idea but did it anyway for personal gain. If he thought it was a good idea, he is an complete idiot moron."
"&gt; Any suggestions to avoid having this happen?

Don't invite her to your place any more. Meet for coffee in public or go to her place.

Alternatively, if you really have to invite her over, put plastic over all your furniture before she arrives."
"Would you feel you were being ""mean"" if you locked a poisonous snake outside? Took a rabid dog to the vet?"
He probably knows that it's where she keeps her money?
"I think you're ignoring or misunderstanding the actual question here. If his parents have money &amp; are paying for his wedding (traditionally the bride's family's responsibility), then they may be trying to ensure a big, impressive social event. Their friends will be invited, not just your friends. They have a class expectation to meet of what a wedding is supposed to look like. And your fiancé may or may not have a similar outlook on it. 

If this is the case, than this is a compatibility issue. The idea that life milestones should be big productions will extend past your wedding day. Best case scenario is that your future husband agrees with you &amp; you as a pair disagree with your in-laws. Worst case scenario is that he agrees with the in-laws &amp; this becomes an issue for every big life event. Take this seriously &amp; figure it out now."
"Yes, I've dealt with both depression and anxiety on and off for many years. It's more likely that it's a symptom of depression than that I'm doing it subconsciously to avoid sex."
"I agree grades aren't everything but guess what? He is paying he can set conditions. Demanding to see transcripts to continue paying for college and having to maintain good grades is exactly what a scholarship would require.
"
"If a guy is intentionally hiding that he doesn't want marriage or kids until the gauntlet is thrown, after you financially support and grow up with a person who you've expressed your desires to marry and have kids with...

It's fair to say at least *some* time was wasted."
"Honest talk. You need therapy. This negative self talk is so harmful. It's something I struggle with (and not because of abuse but that's just the way my brain is wired) but you have to work at it. 

You CAN do things. You are strong to have coped with so much. I promise you life can be so much better. "
"Telling you that you were unusually mature for your age is the oldest line on the book. It's what all pedophiles tell the victims that they are grooming. 

I'm sure you were mature and intelligent--but you were still 15. You had few years on thus planet. You never completed your education, held down a job, lived on your own, been through a couple of breakups, managed other people, supported another person, any of that. 

No matter how mature you were, you were a young adolescent with no real world experience to speak of. "
"&gt; Could she really be that evil to not give a damn about that only to spend 30 minutes a month with him?

Evidently so.  There's no way I'd take her back after cheating and then lying about said cheating once confronted.  It's not like she felt guilty and told you on her own volition.  It had to be pressed and pried out of her and only then did the grief and waterworks come out.  She's upset that she was caught, not for what she did."
"Oh, don't apologize. 

I think I woke up this morning even more pissed off so I may be coming across more aggressively than I intend to. "
"This, although op, if you're looking to keep peace, you can offer to help with a resume,  recommendation letter, moving expenses,  but short term, get them on their own feet help."
To add it his insurance might not allow him to let them in his beach house
"OP, my advice is to make an offer on the ring of, say, $40,000 cash with an expiration date of 30 days.  Then the offer becomes $35,000.   Just because the ring is appraised at $110k doesn't mean anyone is going to pay that much.  It's a chance you take that someone will offer her $50,000 but you've been without the ring for 10 years and even though loosing it will make you sad, you'll be happier imho for not giving into your sister's manipulation."
"So, if he had one flaw and the impact of that flaw on you was small, well, no biggy. But this is a bit like saying ""my fiancee is perfect, but he has ONE flaw: he's a drug addict"". Well, yea, it's technically one flaw but the repercussions on you are huge.

In this case, as FetchDogFetch states, ""this man has destroyed your confidence, given you severe anxiety, and made you resentful, paranoid and insecure about your appearance"". That's how is ""one"" flaw has impacted you.

I'd put a halt on the wedding until you guys got into counseling and this was addressed. My SO doesn't use porn; it's not as bizarre as people seem to make out if you're in an active sexual relationship and living together."
"I'd tell her... I'm growing my hair out again, and if you cut one hair on my head I'm gone. 


About cutting her hair is different. I'd walk around the house with scissors all the time, just eyeing her hair and smiling. 

"
Wow. Thats pretty cold. You and your daugter are separate people that should have separate relationships with your ex. He can still love and be a great dad to her without being married to you. 
"I'm so sorry it took this long for the asshole-ness to pop out. I'm a lady carpenter myself and when I was online dating, I shoehorned that into my username, my profile, etc., not just because I love my job, but because it got shitheads to show off their sexism right from the get go. Even the 'benevolent' sexism like ""It's nice to see a pretty lady who knows how to swing a hammer"" Congrats on the kickass job,  by the way!"
"Why do you care so much what other people think? If you were arguing that your fiancee doesn't realize the toll pregnancy will take on her body and you're worried about the stress I would be totally on board.

It's concerning you're embarrassed of her and that you are willing to put your relationship on hold because of what your parents think. Remember your fiancee is supposed to be your life partner and make decisions with you - not your parents. You are both adults and you should be able to stand up to your parents. If you tell your fiancee what you've written here I wouldn't be surprised if she left you. "
How old is your son? Can he tell you anything? Is he behaving any differently?
"Your ""friends"" can go fuck themselves. Horny and disrespectful assholes the lot of them. You are a good young man who did the right thing. Your friend is lucky to have you."
"Whatever you do, don't give him any nudes of you. Because when, not if, you break up with him, he'll fap to them forever."
"Oh god, yes, but not to my face. I know she really disproves of me as a parent and my family in general. 

We have way too much fun for her taste. Not kidding. There's been a few times my kid is being a kid... laughing and playing to boisterously outside before a family dinner, you know, like the little heathen he is, and she's *tried* to discipline him.

That ended very quickly. When I stopped her she got super pissed like a crazy person and we left. Had a good chat with my kid about people sometimes just having a no-good very bad day, and that he wasn't in any trouble at all, and lets go get some ice cream. And be silly. "
"It's not ""assume malicious intent from every man."" It's ""assume malicious intent from men who ignore boundaries and follow you to your car.""

Look, it's great that *you* didn't mean anything wrong when you were following around people. Generally, safe people don't follow women to their cars. They don't leave campus and come back looking for them. "
So? She should work and contribute. You are basically sacrificing yourself for her dream and in the long run that it unhealthy for a relationship.
He can't make babies. I don't understand how you can act like there are various options in this situation. You're either okay without having a baby or you need to be in a relationship with someone else. 
"So HIS feelings matter, even though he horribly insulted her and falsely branded her a cheater, but hers don't? And I'm sorry, but his concerns aren't valid. She didn't cheat or do anything wrong. For whatever reason, he felt insecure about her coworker. That isn't her fault, and isn't her job to make it right -- ultimately, she can't MAKE him feel less jealous/insecure because that's a ""him"" problem, not a ""her"" problem, and it's up to him to address. I'm insecure about some things that aren't rational, and no amount of soothing from my husband or anyone else is going to fix that -- that's up to ME to fix.

So yes, this is 100 percent about her feelings. If my husband told me he knew I cheated, but it's OK, I'd tell him to fuck right off. That would break me, knowing he literally has no trust in me and thinks I'm a cheater. I think cheaters are the lowest of the low and if someone claimed I was without so much as giving me a chance to defend myself, you're damn right it would be about MY feelings and not their irrational bullshit. OP's husband made a declaration that she did this terrible thing without so much as letting her stand up for herself. I've got to wonder if he's told anyone else about her supposed ""crime."" 

For your future relationships:
&gt; And talked about nothing but how I make her feel and how it is annoying to her and yadda yadda - everything was about her.

If someone is basically accusing you of something when you've done nothing wrong, yes, that is annoying. And hurtful. So yes, it is about your feelings. That doesn't mean your partner's feelings are invalid, but if he's using them to pick fights with you over an offense you never committed, you have the right to be annoyed. "
"Hahahahahahaha. 

That's an incredibly good point! I don't know if I have it in me to ghost him though. "
"Why does their sexuality matter in this case. ""Friends rock!"" would have sufficed."
"For me my ex was very physically affectionate (cuddly etc) but just didn't care about sex at all. I love cuddling, but by the end I had to just forcefully redirect my thoughts whenever I was getting horny because then there'd be so much anxiety about whether I should initiate, embarrassment and disappointment and hopelessness when I was inevitably rejected (as always) and sometimes a fight if she got upset... we had endless talks about what I could improve for her sake because I kept asking her, what turns you on? She claimed her libido wasn't low, so I asked the obvious questions about what I was doing wrong (and of course, if she wasn't attracted to me; she claimed she was but who knows, obviously). How would you like me to approach? etc and she kept claiming different (contradictory) things, like try being rougher, try being aggressive, try being slow, try being gentle, etc and none of it worked until eventually her advice was ""tell me in the morning if you'll want to have sex that evening and I'll get myself into the mood."" So 1. I had literally nothing to do with her arousal? wow. And 2. That never actually worked because then by the evening she'd be feeling anxious and pressured, and I'd be feeling anxious and pressured too (what if *I* don't feel like it? then she'd get *really* insulted because it was so unusual, and I'd blow my only chance at sex for the next long time). Usually it would just be a cycle of procrastination like it's a chore: ""maybe tonight,"" ""maybe tomorrow morning,"" ""maybe this evening,"" ad nauseum and there was always something trivial and easily changed in the way that was her excuse (e.g. she stayed up too late watching netflix). Anyway, by the end I had gotten so good at snuffing out my sexual response to her that any sexual things felt creepy and disgusting like if you were coming onto a sibling, or your platonic friend wanted to cuddle all over you during every movie; normal intimacy became *annoying* to me because I simply wasn't seeing her as a sexual or romantic partner anymore.

More than a year later I still have overblown fear of rejection and anxiety that other people don't actually want to have sex with me. The relationship took a huge toll on my self-esteem. But being with a partner who sees me and just *viscerally wants me* is so, so fucking amazing now.

Sorry to blab so long. I feel very strongly about this. Good for you, /u/TsundereNyx, for doing what you had to do. If you have any issues with lingering guilt or just the difficult sides of a breakup, /r/deadbedrooms is a good support &amp; also feel free to PM me if you need to talk."
Well if my 18 year old cousin said they were dating a 22 year old I'd probably tell them to reevaluate there choice because there is something wrong with the 22 year old dating someone who can't even buy a beer themselves

May I ask why you stayed with a guy who's this much of a jerk?

I personally think this is a lot better look for most men.  It's a nice clean look that makes it clear you are not trying to cover up your hair loss, but it is also a more 'normal' look than totally bald.  I don't have a dog in the fight, I'm a late 40s straight male, but a number of people I run into at work are around my age and have this issue, and I always think the ones that go cue-ball have an overly severe look.  Plus, the back of their head is often kind of lumpy and odd-looking, which would not be much of an issue with  close-cropped haircut.

It's the arbitrary rules and punishments that make someone an authoritarian parent.  There's plenty of good science out there showing worse outcomes for that parenting style.  
"Have you ever seen Dr. Phil!? I saw one where this lady basically was stalking another lady's Facebook for YEARS and stealing all her baby photos and posting them as her own. The stalker printed them up, framed them and had them hanging in her house. The family that was being stalked was terrified and had no idea what else the stalker was capable of. Pretty crazy, but I think it illustrates why you wouldn't want to have your children's photos on the internet."
"I had to look again at his age after reading OP's post, because I swore I must have read it wrong and the brother was 17...not 27 fucking years old! 

This is such a despicable and utterly selfish thing to do; especially when they have treated him so well and have done so much for him!  He 'repays' their love and kindness by sabotaging their chances to adopt! And all because he doesn't want to give up being the center of their attention and heaven  forbid, they 'miss one of his meets'. What the fucking *fuck*!? 

They should be told the truth and Matty should be kicked to the curb. He also should seek  counseling...because something is seriously wrong with him. "
Ya I can't believe he turned down those amazing opportunities because of the gf. Just a complete waste!
"Just remember that no matter what happens you're okay. Don't allow yourself to get lost in the ""We planned this, I did this etc"" train of thought. The beauty of dating is finding qualities in people that you like and dislike."
Another important thing is that the BF is also an actor who had intimate scenes with a woman in a previous play that OP watched. He's just being a hypocrite.
"I don't believe ghosts are real either,  but I have definitely been in houses that made me feel weird and just freaked me the fuck out before.  I wouldn't have said ""no, it's haunted"" but I'd definitely have declined if I got weird vibes from the place. 

He probably doesn't suddenly believe in ghosts, but maybe said that because he couldn't think of another way to define how the house made him feel?"
"Oooh yeah, leave the ring on top of the closed laptop and when he opens it it's on his email w your forwards at the top."
"Thank you.  Your comment seemed like one of the more rational ones I have read.

My doctor recommends I get one at my yearly exam despite being in a monogamous relationship and insurance covers it 100% so I always do. 
"...So let me get this straight...

You're policing when your boyfriend jerks off now? And nagging him about it?

You need to chill. Seriously."
"Well yeah, that is men for you. This actually isn't.... that uncommon OP. I have had 5 guys drunkenly confess their love for me throughout my life, and they got very upset when I rejected them. Lots of my female friends have had this happen too. 

And yes, it is often ""nice guys"" who do this. "
"Agreed. He is so desperately looking for reasons not to tell *his own mother.* OP shouldn't put herself out there like that, it'll sting badly when it falls apart because at this rate, it will. I say give him the ring back."
"He didn't describe her as having a weird fetish for wanting to be touched.

She was pretending to be sick when she wasn't sick so she could be babied. It IS weird. 

It's good that they've talked about it and understand the situation but yeah, her behaviour as described in the first post was not really healthy behaviour."
"&gt;I want my old loving, caring husband back.

That man was a fake, invented to hook you. He never really existed.

You have exchanged one abusive home for another. Thats why he moved in on you when you were still a child. His ideas of ""head of Household"" are medieval and barbaric, and no adult woman would have accepted it, thats why he chose a child - you.

You are in an abusive marriage and need to get out, fast. This will never work. Get out before you get pregnant"
It's not difficult if you train them appropriately. How else do you keep them from eating things that make them sick?
"I also have a feeling that she's not really flirty. She's just kind and courteous to people. Her husband has likely convinced her that that's flirtation. Furthermore, it's clear not just about this because he's keeping her from spending time with close female friends as well."
"Sister sounds like a real piece of work:  ""I was so distressed over my boyfriend's MIA status, I cheated on him."""
"Gotcha. OK. Good.

Still, she be crazy, and blaming anyone but herself for her own behaviour. "
"The police aren't going to get involved in this.  There is no crime being committed here.  It's a verbal dispute among parties.  She didn't physically attack you.  I understand you're upset, but don't waste the police officer's time on something this petty.  They aren't going to help you anyway."
"I like your apology ideas. It makes the gf having to elaborate on why exactly she got hurt and thereby opens a dialogue between OP and gf. 

Gf can be like ""no, I'm offended because you laughed at my injury"" and OP can be like ""actually I was surprised and caught off guard that you wouldn't go to the doctor with what appeared to be a broken leg."". 


Some wants OP to pick his battles and just apologize, but if he does that and she becomes a long term SIL, she'll just keep getting more entitled and you'll soon have to stay away from your brother and her anyway. 

"
In this situation I would do the wedding without a best man if there wasn't enough time to get a replacement.
"If they say it was ""just a joke"" you follow up with ""Explain how that's funny"". Because not only do they have to explain how the death of a family member is funny, they also have to explain their ""joke"" which ruins good jokes let alone horribly offensive ones."
"You are picking and choosing what you want to read.  No one said telling a friend that her fiance is cheating is crazy.  What they are saying is that masquerading as a stranger, coaxing a pseudo confession out of a third party and then injecting that information into the marriage of your friend in an effort to dismantle her relationship is crazy.  And I think you realize that or else you wouldn't be pretending that people are trying to paint you as crazy for doing perfectly normal things.  They're painting you as crazy because you're doing crazy things.  Which you know or at least suspect or else you wouldn't be asking for advice."
"You're not being treated like you're an asshole here, you're being treated like someone asked for advice and isn't listening/actively arguing against all the advice people are giving.

Honestly, women probably avoided you ""before you were misogynist"" (I put this is quotes because there are clear signs you were one before you realized) because you came across as emotionally needy and clingy. You state in your original post that women have given you nothing but basic respect; congratulations, that's literally all they owe you. No one is entitled to tell give you compliments or find you attractive, especially when you abhor their entire being because of their genitals.

You mention that vulnerability is important to you in relationships. That's great! But realize that being vulnerable with another person requires a certain level of intimacy that you actually have to work at and achieve rather dumping your worst fears and anxieties at the feet of someone that isn't ready for that. Women have a reputation for being the more feeling gender, and sometimes this results in socially awkward men baring their soul waaaaay too early in the friendship. Yes, we had a great conversation about an anime and have been talking steadily as friends for a week, but suddenly you're dumping every insecurity you've ever had on me and it's making me extremely uncomfortable because we aren't at that level of friendship. Do you do the same with male friends?

From what I've gathered from your responses, it seems like you used to put women on a pedestal, which is dehumanizing. Your tone also switches from ""Women have given me nothing but basic respect"" to ""But my emotional needs were never met, despite believing they were equal to me. Instead, they said I was selfish and entitled when I cut myself."" Wait, what? How did this switch from ""one girl told me I was selfish"" to an all encompassing ""they""? Why are you punishing all of womankind for one asshole (who maybe wasn't even an asshole, but put off by your inappropriate push towards intimacy that you hadn't earned)? You go from admitting that women give you basic respect and decency, to dramatically saying you're treated with hatred by all women and you just want basic decency and respect (which, from your original post, you say you already have).

So, what do you want us to say here? What kind of response do you want? It sure as hell doesn't seem like you actually want advice to get over your hatred towards women. And women will avoid the fuck out of you because your fury and desperation is something that most people can sense from a mile away.

I'm going to echo what everyone else is saying: see a therapist. Keep looking until you find one that fits. Preferably a female therapist so you can have exposure to a woman that isn't a family member."
"Spend time before the trip remembering your grandmother. Mine just passed away recently, and the funeral was nice and all. 

But the part that was the most important were the days before and the days after her death. Time spent with family reminiscing.

Funerals are for the living. You can be there for your dad and grandad before you leave, and when you get back. 

Who knows. Maybe on the trip you'll think about her and write a wonderful letter you can give your dad/grandad. Maybe not. 

Just go on your trip and enjoy t. "
"What do you mean by ""vandalize""?

I can tell you now, if it doesn't come from you, I can almost bet that one day it will come.

Better to come from you while you can make a sincere apology not rooted in ""keeping the girl"". I would also include her parents so you truly cover all your bases and understand the impact it had on them. This way, you can make an amend and ask them what you can do to make it right.

Be prepared though, you may have caused an unforgivable pain and may lose her regardless. I wouldn't think so, but I don't know the depth of your actions."

"I agree with this advice.  Give her the heads up and pick a new song.  It sucks and that was a pretty lame move for a good friend.  But make lemonade from the lemons. Maybe you guys can do a special pre-wedding date night, your last night as an unmarried couple.  Show her the video, present her the book and have your ""last dance"".  Tell her how you wanted to make this special, but don't want it to feel ruined by Kyle's choice to be a lame friend.  Then you can both jog through some memories and think of another special song that means a lot to both of you.  She'll feel good about being included in helping YOU solve this problem.  "
"You can't really be expected to take sleeping pills every night for *possibly* the rest of your life, though"
Yeah. Lots of stuff isn't sexy. Welcome to adulthood.
Your girlfriend is a homophobe and gay therapy is basically mental torture.  Teenagers typically date so waiting until he has his own place is an equally odd rule.  I would dump her at the speed of sound.
"I think it's pretty delusional that you used the term morals when your original plan was to break up with your girlfriend at work. As an avid stoner myself, I can tell you that smoking a little pot after a long work day doesn't keep me from loving someone or catering to their needs any less. However, being with someone who is judgmental and inconsiderate? Total blockage. 

In your original post, your girlfriend offered to get you an Uber. That's a favor! It's not her responsibility to get you a ride when your friend bailed... you're an adult. She did that because she was being kind. And instead of looking at her kindness, you saw her as debilitated by weed. 

I think the best thing you did for her was breaking up with her. 

I take that back... the best thing you did for her was bringing her Chick Fil A when she was stoned. Breaking up places second best.  "
"How often do you do something so terrible to your boyfriend that you need to come up with a detailed, scripted apology? Especially while having to guess what you did wrong because you don't know what you did? I feel like I have to make a big apology for a major fuckup to my wife like a maybe couple times a year at most. Probably not even that to be honest. The rest of the time a simple ""I'm sorry, I screwed up"" seems to do just fine."
This is true. I believe I'm experiencing that.
"Dude, it's literally psychological torture.  I pretended to be religious after losing my faith maybe two years into college (I live in the bible belt in the US and have an extremely fundamentally religious family).  I didn't come out to my family until I moved and was financially independent.  In the meantime I was extremely depressed by pretending I was someone I wasn't.  ""Conversion therapy"" is that on steroids.  Whereas I found a local group that met twice a week where I could talk about my problems, this kid is being forced to bottle up his feelings and they're trying to brainwash him to make him think he's straight.  This is really not good and it's even illegal in five states here due to the extreme psychological trauma it has on the victim."
"Congratulations to your ex for dodging the bullet!  You need some serious therapy, dude.  You're acting like a straght-up lunatic.  Sane people do not show up at their SOs workplace unannounced, they do not attempt to dump their SO while the SO is in the middle of a work shift, and they sure as hell don't *go to the person's house* after discovering that they're not at work to submit to your abuse on your schedule.  

Your TL;DR should say: Girlfriend recognized that she was too impaired to operate a vehicle, offered to call and pay for an uber, and I threw a ""kid getting dragged out of Disneyland after a week in the park"" level tantrum.  Please tell me how morally superior I am.

You're also a classic case of *that guy/girl*, who ""hates drama"" but is in fact the one causing most or all of it.  "
"Most Muslims dont expect other people to maintain their religious restrictions. Just because they dont partake in something, doesnt mean that I cant. If that means they dont come over anymore, thats also valid."
"Hey, I'm a police officer, verified on /r/Protectandserve. Basically how we handle out of state harassment cases is that we contact the local police agency and have them advise the perpetrator to cease and desist their conduct. We've had agencies from out of state contact us with the same requests.

Orders of Protection are enforceable in all 50 states. However, usually for an order to be issued, the perpetrator must be arrested for an offense involving you as the victim (at least that's how it goes in my state, I am unsure of other states). Go down to your local police station and explain your situation. You don't have to go into the whole story, rather tell them about the harassment that is taking place. They should be able to guide you in the right direction."
"Jenna and I didn't stay as close

I haven't seen Jenna since April

You are not her best friend any more. Your friendship is not a priority to either of you. Invite her out once and then let it go. If she wants to hang out with you she will."
By this he means just leave without her
"Story time.  Me and my girlfriend had a messy breakup. She was super needy and we did that thing where we kept breaking up and getting back togehter for like a year.  I was insecure and having a rough time in my life.

I finally reached a point where I was strong and independant, I finally didnt need her! I met some great friends! I was FREE!!!!  1 month later Intext a text ""I am pregnant"".

I died inside, or rather I would have rather died.  I cant explain to you how god damned upset I was. The dark feeling in my chest. I wanted SOOOO badly for her to abort.  I pictured my life so boring and shitty and dragged down with this god damned baby!  For 9 god damned sleepless months I fucking shit my pants and had nightmares.  Being tied to this needy BITCH whome I hated, for the REST of my life!

Ill never forget getting the text ""She is in labor"".  Walking down the corridor... coming around my corner and seeing him all wrapped up in his blanket. I had no idea how I would feel, but I didn't think it would be like that.  I wont try to explain it, but it changed me.

All my fears melted over time. And as he grew and I saw him evolve and change and develop a personality, watching him laugh, the feeling of him needing me, his lips on my cheek, his eyes and soon our inside jokes and questions and wonders of the world.  He just went to kindergarten just 2 days ago and it was a feeling like I would have never experienced.... and here I wanted to abort this.

The life before him seemed great. But in hindsight it was completely empty.  Priorities change and your hard wored nature takes care of everything.  You may not be ready, but lemme tell you. You won't ever regret your children.  You may regret who you had them with, but you wont regret them.  You COULD regret the abortion and likely will when you have another child.

No one is ever truly ready.  I didnt even like kids. Hated other peoples kids.  But I love this one :)

So I cant speak for you or tell you what to do, but I can tell you, whatever your fear is of a life dissPearing because of a child, well it might pale in comparison. But you are the captain of your own ship :) talk about it with wifey

Good luck!"
"If it feels sketchy, it probably is. Sure, no one has done anything like that for you... but he's not really doing what he initially talked about either. 

I feel like when you're really interested in a person you go through a lot of planning for the first meeting/first date, and you would be communicating about things like this. I think offering to cook you a meal implies he's hosting, versus if he had asked if you would be willing to host him and let him cook for you. Right now you're getting.. leftovers in an uncomfortable environment. Doesn't exactly sound ideal to me."
"Can you try telling them you're just uncomfortable being alone with him or that he makes you uncomfortable? That you'd like to continue tutoring but with someone else, maybe a woman? That's really not an unreasonable request for a reasonable parent to consider..."

I lived in a big city and am still working through a time that a man assaulted me for saying very directly to leave me alone. It made him angry at me. It happens sometime.
"I don't smoke. But I'd smoke if I was dating you. 




She's going to be better for this breakup.  I really, really hope that you take to heart what others have said to you in these posts, and become better for it too.  I hope you realize that you value control and entitlement over a give-and-take partnership, and that you will serve no one but yourself with that attitude.  You're going to either be very lonely, or emotionally hold any future SO's hostage, unless you change your perspective and grow some healthy relationship standards. "
"No. When she deliberately evades, she's giving reason for suspicion.  

I might tell my husband ""bye, I'm running out to the store"", or ""I'm going to this lecture on Thursday with a friend"" because I don't consider the detail relevant, and I don't think he'll care, but if he asks me ""oh, what store?"", or ""oh, who are you going with?"", I'd answer, because I'm not trying to hide the answer from him.  

If you ask, and she continues to refuse to answer, that's suspicious, and you're reasonable to be concerned."

"This is a pretty complex issue. I have some sexual trauma in my past but I really love kink that branches into ""consensual non-consent."" Not exactly the same as your situation, but... I could see someone being similarly reluctant. The thing is, even if my kink or your bf's kink are because of traumas or other weird things in our past, that doesn't mean we're actually thinking about them, like  your bf is not going to be thinking about his dad when he has you act in a daddy-dom way for his pleasure. Similarly I am not thinking about the negative sexual experiences in my past when my boyfriend indulges me by pretending to force me. It honestly doesn't remind me of those experiences at all because those experiences were not the same thing... those were bad things that happened to me, not me playing in a totally safe, consensual, understanding, and loving relationship. It doesn't look the same, it doesn't feel the same. When I remember those past experiences I feel sick, vulnerable, ashamed, and awful; when I remember my BF doing this kind of play with me, I feel loved and turned-on. It's compartmentalized completely.

But, I'm not your boyfriend. Definitely have a big talk with him about whether he thinks daddy-dom behaviours might trigger some bad feelings from his past. The most important thing is that even if your kink ventures into D/s or sadomasochism with a daddy theme, he must always actually feel safe. He must feel comfortable safe-wording with you and you guys should tip-toe into the practice carefully, and back off a little if you come across any unexpected triggers. For example, for me, oral sex can't be any part of that kind of play, and neither can slapping in the face. Those things didn't actually ever happen to me during my bad experiences so in some ways those triggers were unexpected, but the psyche is weird.

He might have been more attracted to you now than he would have been to you-at-20. That doesn't mean he ONLY wants you because you're older, it just means he looked across the bar and thought ""fuck yeah, that guy is totally my type."" It didn't mean that's all he loves or desires about you. We all have types and preferences about body-type, gender, gender presentation, etc etc etc, often we have 'looks' we prefer in a person. I think this is just the same as that. But you know what? Talk to him about that too! Don't accuse him, phrase it like it's your own personal insecurity (""I"" statements) and have a loving, healing, reassuring conversation together.

Since you have trouble talking I want to bring up another suggestion. Ask him in person: ""I really want to discuss the idea of daddy kink with you but I always clam up. Would you be okay if I wrote you my thoughts and you can write or talk in return?"" Ideally then you can use facebook or even just a text file to write him your thoughts and questions (or have it pre-prepared). Let him respond how he's comfortable and roll with it from there, continue in text or in person. My bf and I do this, because we both clam up when we're worried about hurting the other's feelings, and express ourselves better in written word."
"Reported. Do you know how much stuff like that goes unreported, or is reported but covered up? "
Could she be depressed? Suffering from health?  Anything that has her unreasonably drained? Other then if somethings legit wrong  I'd get feeling frustrated.  She is not contributing. If she hates cleaning maybe she should work while kids at school and then you can afford a cleaner?

My girlfriend and I managed to take her dining room table apart and move it downstairs by ourselves with no men or unprepared teenagers involved. They need to grow up and act like adults."
I do understand why she told people after you told her not to (seriously mate go see your doctor. Not eating for days isn't normal breakup behaviour) but you are well within your rights to go no contact.

"Yes, it's crazy. He's in a very different stage of life and dealing with cancer. Leave him alone. "
"&gt;But I can't really think of a reason why she SHOULDN'T come along if she's able to, either. 

You not wanting her to come is a perfectly valid reason. 

Tell her you want to do couple things with your boyfriend that you don't get to see very often, that you'll try to plan a trip where he can come out and visit them but this trip is for just the two of you. 

And if she argues be like ""mom I gotta have that dick"". "
"It sounds like the kids are exactly where they should be. With their parent who can feed them, clothe them, put a roof over their heads, and send/pick them up from school. At home where they have their own beds, their own toys, and friends.

I understand your SIL wanted to divorce but she can't stand on her own. In your own words she is a mooch. She doesn't have her own place, doesn't have a strong work ethic, and selfishly laid her problems on her sister's doorstep -- knowing your wife wouldn't have the heart to turn her away.

She needs to get out of your house. Stop defending her. Coddling her doesn't help her to become self sufficient. You and your wife need time to focus on your marriage and overcoming the damage. Ask your in-laws if the twin can move in with them. If not, help her find look through the roommates wanted ads.

Your nephews sound like they will be okay with dad. So let it be. Try to repair the damage by extending an olive branch. He's not going anywhere -- he's their dad so it would be best to stay cordial with him so you can remain close to the nephews."
"I'm insanely white, almost aggressively so. My whole family is dark - all dark Hispanic people with dark hair. I have been described as ""safely ethnic"", ""just *sorta* Hispanic"", and ""that white chick who speaks, like, **really** good Spanish.""

I might not tell my kids the minute I got the diagnosis, but I'd be hard pressed not to pull their asses out of school just so we could see each other as much as possible!

I think what made my partner even madder is he'd been sent away to camp the week before his dad's last week on earth. So he kicks himself, knowing he was away from home, goofing off, while his dad only had two weeks left. I have no idea why his parents chose this. MIL says they ""thought it best.""  I can't see how.

"I don't think she will be with you much longer at all, let alone ever trusting you again.

You 100% cheated on her. You need to start using that word. It means nothing that you were drunk, it means nothing that he's a guy, you cheated on your girlfriend of 7 years and ruined your relationship. "
"I think this kid deserves to know the truth. Though I cannot presume to know what you have gone through, I can understand Eli's behavior towards all this as a act of frustration. He has a RIGHT to know about himself, you are not protecting him by lying to him, you are just eroding the trust and bond that you have between the two of you. 

Your duty is to tell him the truth, in the most humane way possible and to hold his hand as he deals with it. I would advice the help of a therapist as to how you will present the information and the steps that you should take afterwards. Not knowing about your own self is a very specific kind of hell, do not do this to this kid."
"It doesn't matter who is right or if what you did crossed a line as defined by an outside party. You can't shame him or push him into seeing this from anyone else's perspective and it only takes one person wanting out to end a relationship. In his mind, you went too far, end of story. Apologize, assure him it will never happen again, potentially set alcohol limits for the future, and make sure he understands that nudity is all that happened. 

Your goal isn't to be right or to prove to him it wasn't a big deal, it's to save your relationship, so act with that in mind. Think of ways that you can ease his worries for the future and ways to make it up to him."
"Have you done anything to make this right? Your kid assaulted someone who was defenseless over a game. I have small kids, i don't know that i would want to be involved with someone who tried to brush off such an incident.
I hope you have talked to your son. There might be legal ramifications, you could help by getting him into some therapy, he should be made fully aware of the implications of his actions. 
Is this the first time he has gotten violent with small children. The fact that your sister is cutting off your family says that her kids might be divulging more information. This is the age for your child to be taking responsibility. I hope you are modeling that by showing him how an adult is supposed to act when a small child is harmed."
Lawyering up as we speak. :) 
"Combine this with buying a big bag of sunflower seeds and giving them to her. 

Heck, maybe she got like 100 pounds of peanuts from a food bank or something weird like that. When I was a kid and we got charity food we'd get some of the weirdest stuff. 

And when she says others have been doing it, ask her who, and assure her you're going to talk to those people. She might feel like she's being singled out. It doesn't excuse her behavior, but I try to think of every nice human gesture before going the legal routes. Especially considering the top comment. 

If you do get hives again, god forbid, and somehow it's not life threatening go and show her. I've only had hives once or twice, and it wasn't bad so if this isn't realistic I apologize for suggesting. "
"I also want to add this, something that resonated within me when it finally struck. It's hard to believe in the moment i know. But..

Everyone wants to believe that their love is unique and all knowing and that no one else can truly understand or see what they see. 

But it's simply not true. All these people, around you, on the internet, in school. They all have loved. They have been through things.. They have had passion and lust and the feeling that no other relationship could ever be what they had. They have yearned and ached. They have had sleepless nights. They have cried, they have laughed. They have smiled, and been happier in that moment then they ever were. But things change, things come to an end. And just when you've given up all hope after losing that love, you find a love more real then anything you could have dreamed. Whether it be another lover, a job, a hobby, a mind state. You find this love. This love that isn't what you thought or pictured or dreamed up. It isn't perfect, It just is. And everyone deserves a chance at that. Everyone. You deserve a chance at that. And I promise you with all my heart, that this. What you have right now. Isn't it."
"Holy fuck, she said jokingly what she actually ment. That he was more attractive than you and superior to you genetically. Uhh. 

I could try for a month or so, but ultimately, I think I wouldn't get past it."
"I could try this, but I'm still worried she'll be oblivious, or she'll realize what I'm implying and get crazy defensive about it.  I don't know.  I'm half tempted to be blunt at this point and tell her my true concerns."
"Hey there, I just had a baby myself. 

Sex has definitely decreased for the following reasons: 

1) I am breastfeeding and I just hate to be touched by anyone right now. Even my own infant at times. I'm so sick of being grabbed at constantly. I just want to be left alone for like an hour for Christ's sake! It's physically and mentally exhausting having a human being rely on me for life; I don't want a grown man basically doing the same. There's so much stress that comes with breastfeeding (in addition to the hormones!) and it feels awful to feel like you HAVE to take care of your baby and your husband. It stretches a woman's mentality of ""I have to be everything to everyone"" thin. There's nothing worse than being ""on call"" at night for both a baby and your partner.

2) My vagina has serious mental issues of its own. I say that because there's nothing physically wrong with it (I had a csection and I'm all healed up) and literally nothing came out of it during childbirth. But still, it hurts like a mofo sometimes to try to have sex and I have no clue why. It's frustrating, embarrassing, and takes me right out of the mood. 

3) I'm plain old pooped. 

4) As a previous commenter said, nurturing my baby makes me feel totally fulfilled. I have little drive for anything else. I try to show my husband how amazing, appreciated, and wonderful he is in any other way I can. I do try to have sex once-ish a week, but let me tell you, I have to work up to it. It sucks for me that it feels so forced right now, but we're both very understanding and patient as this is our second child and we've been through this before. 

With our first, it took just over a year to get back in the groove. Even then, it fluctuated based on how the baby was behaving/doing. Children change things! I'd be patient if I were you. Immediately prior to baby #2, we were back to a healthy sex life of about 4-5 times a week.

Another note- being nagged and asked for sex or sexual favors when you have PPD (which I have experienced, symptoms being anxiety and feeling like a failure to the point of tears multiple times a week) would be awful and make a woman feel all the more pressured, and thus all the more of a failure. That was my big issue the first time around- I felt like I was failing my baby AND husband for so many different things. He didn't put the pressure on me, but I put it on myself pretty hard based on how our sex life had been beforehand. Sex doesn't need to be one of those issues at a time like that. Thankfully, like I said, my husband never pressures me and we are just moving forward together, knowing that there is an end in sight (even if it's not a definitive end). Be there for your wife and try to make life easier for her. That's the most effective aphrodisiac for a woman ;)

My advice: don't take a mistress with things so out of whack right now. Wait it out and focus on your baby and wife's mental health.

Your obliviousness teeters on the thin line between enraging and charming. No small feat!
"It's called ""public accountability"". You know what's nasty? Sending a child a note like that, for his birthday no less. She's an adult, she can reap the rewards of her malice. The high road is a great rhetorical device if you want to wank to your own self righteousness, but there are too many reprehensible people who squeak by because their communities have never been given the opportunity to bring them to task."
"This is horrible. I don't blame you for not wanting to take in 6 children, financially that would be a HUGE burden, one that very few are equipped to do. I wouldn't take the kids in either. "
"Told him something twice and he ignored you.

The second time he did that, you should have set him down with your serious face on, got him to look you in the eye, took a deep breath, and told him again. 

""You get a small gift, some cake and your friends will buy you a beer. I'm broke""

You should have shut this down."

"Sounds to me like she is afraid of what the change might be like, or that she is in denial that you have a problem.

"Dude, I would really listen to your girlfriend. Seriously. As a woman, we pick up on shit that guys just don't sometimes. I have been in exactly this situation- feeling insecure, and the territorial female friend of my boyfriend would literally ignore me. In a group, she did not speak to me, only smiles chats and giggles at my boyfriend. Conversations were steered away from me. I was invisible. But it wasn't openly hostile and my dear sweet boyfriend didn't notice.

Now, like I said the situation made me feel very insecure. So I didn't bring it up for fear of really displaying that. It came out once or twice when I was drunk but I didn't fully explain until months later when we were much more secure in the relationship.

Women can be subtle, territorial, and quietly mean. Try and take your girlfriends concerns seriously unless her behavior escalates beyond just quietly getting upset."
Yes.
"Dude, stop being an immature asshole and actually face your girlfriend. Communicate with her. If you need more time apart, then tell her that. Right now, you're just being a shitty person. Confront your girlfriend and actually try talking to her instead of being passive. "
"bad idea, this can lead to unnecessary friction, just tell him straight no bullshit you will be dissapointed if you want something of this level. "
"Totally a troll. He sounds just like a guy who posted the other day about how his life had passed him by since he was now 25 and didn't go to college and women on dating sites were garbage and he couldn't do anything or learn anything, etc etc. A real sad sack act. I think the goal is for him to get to 100 down votes and then he wins or something."

Why should she share the cost when she is already contributing to the cleanliness of the household? 
"Yeah, sorry, your girlfriend is right.  She's making very good financial decisions.  She's got an emergency fund for the household, and she's maintaining work-life balance with holidays, AND she's maintaining a relationship with ""your"" mom.  If she's contributing her equal share of her full time job, and you are, then her extra cash is her extra cash.

Honestly, she sounds more mature and financially wise than you.  You can't tell her what to do with her extra money, especially considering you're getting a financial safety net, vacations and visits with your mom out of it."
"&gt; Does this mean she believes her partner is just permanently scarred?

Um, YEAH.

Circumcision *literally* leaves a scar. Not to mention botched surgeries where doctors too off too much skin so after puberty kid's full erection is constrained. (BTW, if you have hair riding up the shaft of your penis the doctor too off too much skin!)"

"Indeed. My aunt's friend was granted one because her husband cheated on her almost constantly, well before and after the wedding. She was able to prove that he entered the marriage with no intention of honouring his vows. It was apparently a long, drawn-out process, but to her it was worth being completely free of him and being able to remarry in the church."
"I feel like you didn't mean to come off this way, but please don't equate dom/sub with abusive relationships. Consent (informed consent by a fully capable adult) is key.

This relationship isn't dom/sub, it's just abusive."
"I understand. It's not fair, at all. It's emotionally abusive. You are not at fault here. You are 100% the victim.

In 4 years though you will be an adult. You can go to college anywhere you want and stay for four years! You can stay in that city for 20 years! Whatever you want. You will be in control then. It will be great.

Live today for the future. Study, take care of yourself."
"At 18 everyone is legally considered an adult. It's not a ""small stretch,"" it's a fact. She's old enough to know better."
"You indeed, 100% are a negligent, horrible parent. How in the world are you not focusing on the fact that your husband beats his daughter ? I'll reiterate:**He beats his daughter!!!** In a civilized society, one wouldn't even think about beating one's animal companion , let alone an offspring. How do you live with yourself knowing that your kids have no sense of security? This situation is the direct result of your neglect. If you want to fix anything, fix the fact that your kids dont have a safe place to call home. "
"From a financial standpoint I don't know if you are ready to have your own apartment without roommates. If one months rent is $1,500 then your combined monthly income should be at least $4,500 (rule of thumb is keep your rental cost at or below 1/3rd of MI). "

"I feel like if you were super duper iron man fit, and put on 5lb, you're still in good shape. It honestly looks like he doesn't understand the difference in body fat composition between men and women. 

Testosterone makes it so much more possible to be at a stupidly low BF% and have abs and muscles. That's why some female body builders (and lots of male ones I'm sure) take testosterone/anabolic steroids. 

Without those male hormones there's no way you guys will have the same lifestyle and be at the same level of muscularity and body fat. "
"To be fair, there is a bit of a difference between kissing/making out and simulating sex.  
I can totally understand not wanting to watch a play where some dude is thrusting his hips between your girlfriend's legs and kissing her. Particularly knowing they will have been practicing for a long time in advance too.  

In my opinion, she should definitely take the role, but I can't blame the boyfriend for having these feelings. Considering he wants her to follow her dreams, his mistake was telling her about how it makes him feel. Sure, it's good to communicate and be open about your feelings, but sometimes it's best to carry your cross in silence."
"When I was in Boston I lived in a place like that. It was a student studio apartment at BU. I went in and I was immediately creeped out. The room was dimly lit. A meter away from one of the windows was a brick wall directly facing it. The light created a soft buzzing noise you wouldn't hear unless you switch it off. Some days you see cockroaches crawling around and you wouldn't know where they come from. It was one of the worst terms of my life (I was doing a 6 week summer course). There were other oddities and occurrences (not supernatural; just weird) as well. 

The apartment drove me nuts. My food store basically consisted of corn flakes and yogurt. I stopped sleeping at night. I would stay up all night and play computer games rather than sleep then do an hour of homework if I felt up for it. Often times I'd go hungry at around 4 AM, so I'd walk half a mile to a convenience store for cheetoes. When my parents found out they freaked as I was a girl alone. My living habits went to shit. I'd sleep at 8 AM after the sun's up. Go to lunch at 1130. Go to class at 1. Get out at 5. Nap until dark. Eat dinner at the Chinese place next door. Repeat. 

Finally I had enough. I rang my parents sounding probably halfway to the madhouse and DEMANDED to move out. They got me a BnB for a week at great expense but I felt SO much better. I never went back to the flat except to do a quick clean up and retrieve the rest of my belongings and after I did I bolted out of there. I don't know what made the flat so scary. It just was. No one should live in a place that makes them feel like that. Haunted or not it made me into a living zombie."
"Yeah, I can't tell whether or not to be pissed off nobody told me until now or just be grateful he told me in time."
Everything you posted here is terrible.
"You said in another comment that your aunt has been selling her snark story to people around town.

Your parents are **going** to hear it from somebody.  It might soften the blow if it comes from you."
"It seems more like he found A culture than HIS culture. His personal connection to it is tenuous. He just liked it.

Of course your attitude towards him is much more appropriate for his wife to have, but as a British person who lived in the US for a decade, the ""my great great grandparents were from England so I'm British too wanna hear my accent?"" thing got old really fast. If a culture doesn't actually have an impact on day to day life, it's hard for me to consider someone as belonging to it."
Is it possible to mention to her exactly what John said? 
I dunno that a rational conversation will have any effect. It seems clear to me that this old chap is not in his right mind and not going to take no for an answer no matter how it is phrased. 
"&gt;Adding new partners to the mix doesn't mean that the relationship between the actual parents should break down. 

Things that do not cause a co-parenting relationship to ""break down"":  politely asking the other parent to check in advance before scheduling the kids for an activity on days he's supposed to have them, telling the other parent that after several years of you doing all the driving in the summer you'd like her to start doing half, saying that you'll need to check with your spouse before making a decision, your spouse posting pictures of her step-kids or referring to them and her husband as her family.

Things that DO cause a co-parenting relationship to break down:  sending drunk emails to the other parent about how much you hate his spouse, threatening to (try to) take away his time with the kids solely out of spite.

Seriously OP, think about that last one: *you want to take away a chunk of the time your kids normally spend with the father they love solely to get revenge for him/his wife ""disrespecting"" you*.  He's a good father and you have no complaints about how he's actually treating the kids, this is purely about the drama between the adults.  But you're not even thinking about how disruptive that would be to them, or how it would be hurtful to them to have their time with their father reduced and how much they benefit from having a close relationship with both of their parents.  Really, you're not thinking about *them* at all, just about how you could *use* them as pawns for a power play against your ex and his wife.  

You need to stop focusing on your ego and your ex's wife, and start focusing on what's best for your kids.  Is it better for your kids for you to just ignore the things that irritate you about your ex's wife, or for you to start fights with your ex about his wife?  Is it better for your kids for you to agree to check with your ex before booking something during his days with them so there aren't any scheduling conflicts, or for you to dig in your heels and keep booking stuff without checking so that your kids get caught in the middle of disagreements about scheduling conflicts and potentially miss out on things they could have done if both sets of parents had worked together to coordinate things?  Is it better for your kids to be kept away from their father for reasons that have nothing to do with how good a parent he is (or more likely, forced to be in the middle of a big custody fight where they feel like they have to choose sides or disappoint someone), or is it better for them to continue spending their normal amount of time with him and not be put in the middle of adult drama?

Giving birth doesn't automatically make someone a great mother any more than being a nurse does.  Putting your kids first and doing what's best for them, because you know that's more important than whether or not you feel ""disrespected"", is what makes someone a good mother."
"I agree. if he requires the kind of attention that comes from multiple requests for assistance per day, he needs to be in a facility that can manage that."
"&gt;this is extortion. Definition: the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats.

It's only extortion if it's blackmail. If he robbed his neighbors' house and OP said, ""Pay me $500, or I call the cops,"" then that is extortion. However, OP's nephew stole something from her. She is the victim. If he doesn't make it right (by paying her for the stolen goods that belong to OP), then of course she can go to the cops. It's the same as if he stole $500 from her purse, and she told him he has to give it back or she will report it as stolen by him. "
"She should not talk to the parents. If a report has been made to the school, that's a start. It needs to go to the district and the state education agency. All of these groups have mechanisms to deal with this. She is a mandatory reporter so really CPS is the first call she should have made. 

I hope something can be done promptly! "
"Then why would he want to be an in relationship with you?

Here's a little secret...he actually knows you won't do anything; but his own fears are so strong he needs to make you weak in order to survive.  Hint...it gets worse..."
"OP's family also clearly has never managed a business or hired people. I've done both. I don't give a shit how old you are, I only care about whether you can do the job. In fact, I'd probably like the older person more because they're probably more mature and better at communicating."
"This was stupid ""I feel very guilty about this, but I can't force myself to not think about it. I'm a man after all."" So because you're a man you have no self control? Ok, ass hole. 
Break up with her, you sound miserable."
"Legally the dog belongs to you. Veterinary records are in your name, the dog has been under your care for three years.

Ethically the dog belongs to you. You're the only home he's known. Three years is the entire formative years of his life. You are his family. He's not an object like a sofa that your sister left in storage. He has feeling too and would be heartbroken to be sent away with a stranger.

Tell your sister this isn't a conversation or a subject of debate. He's been your dog for years now, and there's zero chance that you'll change your mind, and if she brings up any more stupidity about it being ""cruel"" that he lives in an apartment, you can just laugh.

Does she imagine that after having had the life he's had for three years now, that he wants to spend all his time stuck out in her back yard? Because that's what she would do with him, once the novelty wore off.

Seriously, please don't even consider turning Hank over to this person. THAT would be cruel."
"Being a barista is my part-time job. My full-time job is as a translator for a major international publisher, a job for which a bachelor's degree is required and a master's degree is preferred. I was hired on the spot after showing a better than 99% fluency accuracy level between three languages including slang nuances and idiomatic expression. This pays the bills and more. I estimate that within two years English will be among my fluent languages and I will translate that, too. My employer says my English is excellent but I need more practical and applied experience in conversation to master slang and idioms, at which a translator must excel. My girlfriend is not Asian, she is White from European descent. 


Some of the best people I know I met working as a barista, both my coworkers and people I serve. I work as a coffee slinger for shits and giggles and to kill loneliness but those who do it for the money aren't losers. One of my coworkers plays the guitar for our customers and they love him. Others are great artists. It's sad not all talent is recognized or rewarded monetarily. From what I understand some of the world's greatest painters were monetarily hand to mouth. But they mattered. I think if you're happy you've got toes in the door of success whatever that means to you, whatever your bank statement says. This older gentleman who stops by every morning when I'm working, a banker (large triple shot nonfat no foam latte, 140 degrees two splendas), told me that coming to our cafe is one of the few times a day he smiles. Is happy or a smile success? I think so. In a way we're all doing what we do so we can smile and be happy."
"Yeah, that sorta changed the story.

Pretty sure ""work husband/wife"" is just a really outdated or colloquial sort of thing to say, like calling someone ""honey"". I'd just say, ""not a fan of the term, bro"". But the fact that he's ""obsessed"" with the idea... makes it sound like he's fishing for an affair or something, I dunno, or trying to reinforce an idea. 

A coworker of my SO used that term to describe my SO and a mutual other coworker. I hated it intensely and suddenly felt more jealous then I thought I could. But I had to just get over it, especially because the person that used this term basically used it to refer to any time any 2 people of opposite sex became apparently good friends or just hung out with eachother or even just had a certain kind of banter.

I would say to OPs SO that you acknowledge and understand his feelings, that you maybe should have corrected this behavior earlier but didn't think it was a big deal until looking at it from a fresh perspective, and will definitely set boundaries that will not interfere with work and the general status quo as it should be."
"&gt;""My insecurity stepped in because I felt men generally are attracted to the unstable. Maybe I'm too put together.""

But you're staying with your SO who has openly admitted he thought about cheating on you, and your reaction is to just go and cheat on him too, not break up with him.

If men you're encountering are generally attracted to the unstable, they aren't attracted to you because you're too put together."
"I totally agree. I lived in the Midwest for a year and had these two female roomies who grew up in Minnesota and never left. One of them would say so many racist things to me but after the third time, I wasn't even offended at all. It was just pure ignorance and, exactly what you said prof, a reflection of her living environment and culture. I never bit back. But she was also too dumb to carry on an intellectual conversation, so I didn't try to educate her either. We lived somewhat harmoniously and she thought we got along swimmingly. Some people are just a bit aloof. She talked about herself all the time, and had no interest in learning new things. Lol oh well. Her loss.
The other one was curious though so we talked more about culture differences. We remained good friends!!
Being in close quarters is so difficult, OP. I get how this has been grating on you for some time. If you can't switch roomies and can't communicate better with her, I would suggest just making yourself impervious to these kind of insults. There's no point casting pearls before swine. "
For you. It doesn't affect YOU that way. 
"&gt; She's still got a key, too.  

This is an easy one. Change your fucking locks. As for what to do beyond that...restraining order? Move out and don't tell her where you're going? Firmly cut off all conversation with her and call the cops when she shows up at your door uninvited? She's toxic and will only continue to make things worse for you the longer this goes on.  

&gt; The first time I broke up with her she threatened to OD on pain pills. Any time she doesn't get what she wants she threatens to go on a drug binge.  

I'm going to pull a phrase from the classic ""Drinking Out of Cups"" YouTube video (watch it if you haven't seen it). ""Not my chair, not my problem."" To be blunt, you have no reason to give a shit about her or her health anymore. Care about yourself first."
"Spending the money is important, though, because it signals that you're not looking for an emotional replacement, or a new partner, you're paying for a service.

If you don't think sex is something valuable enough to spend money on, what do you think that says about how much you value sex with your wife? 

(oh, and on the 'more adventurous' stuff, which I do NOT want the details on, I'm guessing it involves some accessories, toys, costumes and/or clothing, all of which cost money, as well as possibly requiring some preparation in advance, which also has a value to it. Again, if you don't think that's worth money, what does that say about how you view the people you expect to offer it to you for free?) "
"He did think the baskets idea was a good one, and he came with me to buy them. Yes they were mine in that I purchased them, but he agreed and he knew well what they were for and used them to the point of overflowing them.... So now he thinks they're annoying, even when I've offered to clean them.

He thought the suitcases were a good idea, he thought the shoe-rack was a good idea, I've asked him numerous times about how I can make this easier for him and I. It always reverts back to ""the floor (or table, or counter, etc) is my castle.""

The rest you are right on, but I have no idea how to ask him to do something he doesn't want to do (tidy). I seriously don't even mind doing it myself, telling him exactly where I'm putting each item, but he doesn't like it. 

"
"I think this is a good point. She may have decided to not mention it in case it made her bf mad... at her, and/or at her housemate.

"See if her coming to live with you is a possibility. Talk to your girlfriend about it. If you both agree to that, then contact your dad and let him know what's happening and that you would be more than willing to take her in and can provide a good home for her. "
"The ""don't ask, don't tell"" aspect complicates this. I would usually say that if you wouldn't be comfortable telling your wife, it would be a problem; but your entire system is built on not giving each other the details.

...that said, I think at this point, you do need to talk to your wife about it. ""Sweetie, I know that we usually leave what we do on business trips quietly out of our lives at home, but I've been keeping in friendly contact with someone I met up with on a trip. Is this okay with you, or should I cut off the relationship? I don't want to make you uncomfortable."""
"If he reacts to the feelings of care by throwing them into a deep dark hole instead of acting in caring ways, then for all intents and purposes he doesn't care. See also: if someone says they love you but they don't do loving things or act in loving ways, then it's really irrelevant what they feel inside them - there's no functional difference between them loving you and them not loving you."
"I get what ur saying and what OP is saying and I have worked a job like that with a commute like that. My question is what was he doing on the weekends? Does he work 7 days a week? Cuz as a ""single for the summer "" man who can't make that much mess has almost every weekend to himself. I'm assuming he still did chores but if money is that tight I'm assuming he wasn't shopping etc. 

Sounds like he was sleeping and drinking. No judgement. I still think his wife should take a part-time job for experience but the answer isn't at the bottom of a bottle. And it's an extra cost. 

Lay off the liquor OP!

That's assuming that she paid into obama care and that she doesn't make more than the poverty line in whatever state she's in
"I can see two sides to this. 

Firstly it's possible that your wife is just being an impossible brat about this issue and that you are being treated very unfairly by her. 

However your story reminded me of another couple I knew who had a similar problem. The wife was actually a pretty low key person but she was sentimental and wanted sentimental gifts such as homemade things or a card with loving words in it, that sort of thing. The husband was not this way inclined and didn't really care about gifts at all. He tended to buy her pretty cheap generic gifts which always felt a bit empty and thoughtless to her. Gifts was one of her love languages so when her husband bought her thoughtless gifts she didn't feel loved.

One day she decided to sit him down and tell him that she wanted something different, so she explained her feelings and that it was important to her to get meaningful gifts from him that demonstrated he had been thoughtful and that he loved her.

He balked at this, complained that it was too hard, that he wasn't that sort of person and so on. She was a little disappointed that he wouldn't make the effort but they made a compromise and she agreed to provide him with a list of things she wanted so that he could choose a gift from that. She also told him that she loved getting homemade cards from their young kids and it would mean the world to her if could arrange that too.

The next time it was her birthday it was clear that her husband hadn't listened. One of the items on her list was flowers. He bought her flowers, but it was the cheapest bunch he could get, a pretty raggedy looking bunch and he had clearly put no thought into it as he had grabbed them from the local shop at the last minute on his way home from work so she didn't actually get her gift until the evening. He had given her a card but it just had a generic message, no special words. He didn't attempt to get a homemade card from the kids until the day of her birthday, so it was late. 

Given her husband's obvious lack of thought and effort, the wife was disappointed. She felt that he hadn't made her feelings a priority and that his lack of effort showed he didn't love her. The flowers themselves were not the problem, it was the fact he had made almost no effort that hurt her. She also felt frustrated and that it was impossible to get her needs met by him as he didn't seem capable of listening even when she made the effort to communicate her needs clearly. It made her feel depressed about the state of their marriage and made her wonder if she was important to her husband at all. 

He couldn't understand why she was disappointed and felt really angry about her disappointment. In his mind she was totally un-pleasable. He tried buying her something himself in the past which she rejected. Then he bought something from the list and she was still unhappy! He couldn't understand why she was so upset over what in his mind was a small issue, it was only a birthday! He began to think his wife was rather material and a bit spoilt. 

In this case the husband's problem was that he wasn't listening. Because he didn't listen when she was talking about her needs he didn't realise that it was about his wife needing to feel loved and listened to by him and needing a demonstration that he cared enough about her to make some effort. 

So I do wonder OP if this is part of your problem? I'd love to hear your wife's side of things and I do wonder if in the past she's been clear about her needs and you just haven't listened?"
Tell her that her personal life is up to her and you don't want to get involved.  It's hardly your fault she went and hooked up with another guy and cheated on her bf
"If someone (of any gender) made a Facebook post about our friendship, I would take a screenshot. That would be nice to have saved. 

And then I would be extremely irritated if my partner, who I had never given a reason to distrust me and who I had constantly asked to tone down the trust issues, questioned that screenshot. I'd see it as grounds to end the relationship as well. "

"Wow. I spent $1800 on a bender in Vegas and regard that as the singular worst mistake in my life. This post made me feel about 10-15 better about myself.

Just so you know, that's going to take you YEARS to pay off. I hope those five days of fun where were the years of hardship your gonna face. I'm still angry with myself 8 months after my stupid stint in the strip club I blew so much money at. But wow you're in another league of shittiness."
"&gt; I would also be thinking that he's already predicting the relationship may not last.

Protecting yourself for the worst-case scenario isn't an assumption that it will happen. "
Don't feel the troll.
"I think the problem isn't even that he wants to date a previous version of her, it's that he wants to date an *imaginary* version of her. He wants a woman who works out 3-4 times a week, goes out to eat and drink, and has time to spend with him, while also keeping a body that only comes from a strict diet, working out 2-3 hours a day, and sacrificing all leisure time. There is no way to be both these things at once. "
"&gt; There's a distinction between punishment and consequences.

Yes. To me, the distinction is that *consequences* are things that happen because of what you did. *Punishment* is things that I do, because of what you did.

&gt;  Postponing the wedding until all this is resolved seems quite reasonable to me.

I disagree, because of how I expect it to play out. ""Resolving"" it should take less than an hour. If it takes much longer than that, I would simply call off the wedding.

I mean, if OP wants to spend six weeks working through her feelings, and oscillating back and forth between anger and forgiveness, and whatever else she thinks might make her feel better, then good for her. But postponing the wedding, unless it takes the form of ""I am no longer sure I should marry you,"" is simply punitive. And for most transgressions, including this one, it shouldn't take more than a day or so to know your own mind. "
It's time. It's past time. Don't delay it any longer. The longer you stay with him the longer it will be until you can find someone who truly loves you. 
"Yeah, I've known some girls from insanely religious families who weren't allowed to have the used menstrual products in the house/let their brothers/dad see any trace of them.

"Sorry to say this but she is engaged in an emotional affair with another woman, is completely disrespecting your marriage and trying to ""nice"" her back into the relationship is not going to work. 

&gt;I ask about her comments about divorce, and she says that things have not been great. I point out that for the past several months, she's been replacing her connection with me and investing all of herself into another person. I point out how negative she has been recently and clearly tie it back to the same timeline.

Do not let her blame shift you away from the above truth. Stand firm on this and repeat the above as many times as you have to before she understands that no amount of attempted gaslighting you into believing her bullshit will succeed. 

As long as she's emotionally connected to her affair partner there is no working on your marriage. This is important. Her ""friend"" has certainly shown herself to be no friend of your union and continued correspondence with this person should be viewed as a one-way ticket to divorce court. You should also demand total electronic transparency via full access to her devices going forward, and if she takes the affair underground then you know where you stand. 

I would see a lawyer ASAP. Yesterday would have been better. She may be putting you off while she plans her escape from your marriage and you should not apologize for taking steps to protect yourself. 

Remember that divorce proceedings can be stopped at any time, and sometimes getting served those papers is what brings the wayward spouse back to reality as it bumps them out of the affair fog. Having to face the consequences of one's actions can be a serious wakeup call when one has been hiding behind an iPhone. 

Good luck. Nothing about this is easy, but you really need to circle the wagons here.

"Saying ""no"" is not mean, but asking the son who you never financed to give shelter to the daughter and SIL you spoiled, when you probably know that they may take advantage and never leave the place, and when you know that you have enough space on your own house, and then calling him ""mean"" when he doesn't accept, is evil.

If you accept, you know the risks. And if you don't, be sure that you're not being mean, even if your parents try to make you feel guilty and manipulate you.
They didn't give you, their son, any help when you were 18 and now are calling you ""mean"" for not giving their deadbeat daughter (and her deadbeat husband) a place when they're already in their 30s. This is totally wrong."

"A year exactly here. On our one year anniversary. I had a big thing planned, I had friends stalling him at an event he was at......

"&gt;A couple of days later he tells me he knows an old email of his was opened from my computer between this girl and him because he left it open and logged on my computer, as found out from his private investigator. Sure, even if your private investigator has software in your email.. He definitely wouldn't find that out because it's not true, I logged out of the email intentionally.. I know it was logged out. Then he continues to accuse me of calling myself because I read his old emails and was jealous of this girl. Stating I should confess because he's been through my phone tons of times behind my back so he can relate. Okay, I'm sorry.. What now? The accusations were bold, lengthy and continued regardless of me saying they weren't true.

Wake up. He keeps throwing crazy accusations at you to keep you off balance and on defence, so that his epically shady behavior continues to go unquestioned. Nope out of this shitstorm. "
"Holy shit, I'm 23, I can't imagine being married and trying for a baby. You're still so young. You don't want to start a family with someone whom you don't completely trust. There's no way he was asking those women about sex advice. Google dot com can cover all your bases. Leave him before you get any deeper into this. Girl, it's not worth it. Love can overcome a lot of things but not with a baby in the mix. Hell, I've left guys for a while lot less. "

Let's review facts, as told by you

- He connects/relates well with young teens
- Boys don't interest him, but teen girls do
- He sends messages designed to delete after a few seconds
- He is in a position of authority over these teens and doing secretive things in his spare time with them

At the very best, he struggles with his maturity and has stunted decision making skills. 

At the worst, and based on this sub's luck the most likely, he is very attracted to these teen girls. 

The only different between the two is one of them lands you in jail. Both are career enders. 

My question is, when your gut is telling you this is wrong (or else why post here), why are you going along with it? Why is this acceptable to you?"

"October is a month away, if at all possible maintain your dignity and sweat it out.  Of course this is much easier said than done.  If you have equipment, know how and time to do it, record her making these threats, again this is easier said than done.  If possible, find a buddy or relative who can let you ""crash"" at their place for the next month, you don't need to be in that house.  The picture you paint, it almost seems certain the police are going to be involved at some point.  When that happens, w/o overwhelming evidence of her threats, you will lose.  I don't mean to sound preachy, but do not drink in the time you have left there.  As much as law enforcement favors the female in these situations, having even a hint of alcohol on your breath makes it worse.  All that needs to be written in a police report is ""appeared to be drinking"" or ""Smelled of alcohol"" and you are doubly fucked.  Do the best you can to get out of their unscathed, chock it up to experience and move on with your life.  Good luck!"

"Nope. I can see you're really struggling with this one. I'll break it down so far that even your three year old could understand it. 

A pregnancy is more likely to spontaneously abort in the first trimester, which ends around 10 to 12 weeks. Most women do not know they are pregnant for the first 6. Many women miscarry not knowing they were pregnant. 

Having suffered 5 miscarriages, OP is at increased risks for future miscarriages. Overlooking the fact that doctors actually advise for you to wait for the first trimester to pass, her request that he wait until they have reached a safer period is not only understandable, but medically suggested - especially for women with her medical history. And despite your oh so woeful, beset tune that men are so put upon and suffer oh so much at the cruel hands of women, demonstrating that you don't know the difference between logical arguments and logical fallacies by way of red herring is both transparent and incredibly poor reasoning on your part."
"If you really don't know what was wrong with you, then you should get therapy with a professional, who will diagnose you and tell you what it was that made you behave that way.

However, if you've already had therapy (as you said elsewhere), then you probably DO know what was wrong with you. The good news is, now you do seem to be functioning generally much more healthily.

What you're struggling with now is the guilt. 

What you haven't accepted yet is that that behaviour occurred as a result of mental illness and is not something that you need to carry guilt for, nor is it healthy for you to hold onto guilt. You literally could not control yourself.

The solution is not to confess this (which will only be destructive pointless behaviour which will cause harm to both yourself and to Jack), but to get therapy to eradicate this left-over guilt you harbour for behaviour you could not control at the time."
"The two of you see a lawyer for your legal options. 

Then see the lawyer separately for YOUR legal and financial options.

Breathe, hydrate, try to rest and try to be strong for yourself and your children. Later - when this mess is settled - I suggest you see a therapist for your own emotional support.

You have a lot to think about but you will get through this. Your children love you and you are there for them - that's the important thing here.

Your husband and his ex will have to work out the details of child support - just make certain you are aware of your own, personal legal and financial options.

I am so sorry you are going through this awful time.

You take care and I wish you all the best.  Take care of yourself and your children as best you can :)

"Hey, have you considered that Bryan just wants to fuck a hot girl, have a good looking woman to take into social situations, have a few kids, and isn't looking for something any deeper than a trophy wife?  I mean, you say Bryan thinks he loves her, but I think anyone that is intelligent enough to be that successful understands that when you marry a party girl, she isn't marrying you because she cares about YOU, she's marrying you for a lifestyle.  

As for your kids, I don't think that you are going to be able to hide the fact that some people have lifestyle marriages.  If she's a good aunt, let her be around them and if it ever comes up, you can explain to your kids why you don't agree with the lifestyle and why you think they shouldn't either."

"Good grief OP you sound like the villain from a Disney movie or something!!

In a nutshell, you're saying you want to convince your younger, more handsome brother to abandon true love in favour of finding someone who *is prettier and makes more money* than the woman he loves.

Meanwhile you yourself don't even have anyone to love. I'm picturing you in animated form, as one of those narcissistic, control-freak villains with the sardonic eyebrows, rubbing your hands together ingratiatingly as you whisper bad suggestions into your brother's ear after inviting him to your cold and gloomy, empty castle one stormy night.

Okay, sorry to laugh. Here's my serious advice on your question:

&gt;He knows I am not too keen on her which has caused us to grow apart.

It sounds to me like he knows as much of your opinions as he wants to hear already - if he wanted more he would ask.  And if, unsolicited, you tell him even *more* about how you are not keen on her you will grow even *more* far apart. Is that what you want to achieve? 

Or do you really think he is going to say ""ok"" and dump his gf on your say so? Because nothing you have said about him so far suggests that, and if it were true that he *was* so easily influenced by family that would be a much bigger issue for him than having a gf with some problems, so really you would be trying to avoid controlling or manipulating him, if you care about him.

Finally, here's my unsolicited advice on other issues revealed by your post: 

You need to accept that your brother is not you, that he is an adult who will make his own decisions and his own mistakes in life, and that genuinely wanting ""the best for him"" actually involves allowing him to be his own man, not trying to control him. 

Brother problem aside, you'll find you lead a better life in general - with less stress and less conflict - if you become more self-aware over these issues of control and anxiety about status, money etc from which you suffer. To address these issues you have to unmask and address your subconscious fear of the world.

"Tell Mark. You don't need to give him the full details of the conversation, just that Joe is in town, you met with him, and he's been attempting to contact you. He deserves to know, and it's his right to decide whether he wants to face his antagonist. 

What Joe did was disgusting. It's horrifying that the school didn't do anything about it. It's horrifying that the police did nothing. I'm surprised this never got publicity -- it should have been a PR nightmare for them. They deserve to be crucified in the court of public opinion.

You don't have to forgive your brother or your parents - but I would leave the door open a bit. Respond to Joe to tell him that you are still angry and disgusted. One day you might be ready to forgive him and your parents, but you aren't there yet. 

You might never be ready to forgive them. You might eventually forgive them after more time and some therapy. You might find yourself 20 years from now, with your parents sick or dying, regretting all the years you spent hating them. You might find yourself 20 years from now with no regrets, loving the family you created for yourself, which includes Mark. 

Whatever happens, you're not ready to forgive yet. And that's ok. But you should seek out therapy -- not because of the forgiveness issue, but because this was a massively traumatic event for you.

"There is no court of law for relationships. You can leave for no reason or all of the above. Personally I think you should stay far far away from this guy and tell a friend in case he turns out to be crazy. People who revel in animal torture are psychopaths. You're way too young to be dating this guy anyways, he is going after younger girls for a reason. Women his age are probably knowledge enough (at least I'd hope) not to put up with this fuckery. Really you can do so much better dear. Don't dump him alone, go to a public place."
"Hey OP. I love love love scary movies. I would NEVER do this to anyone. Your husband is an insensitive ass. Since he won't respect you in this I recommend showing  him this thread and the replies. This is NOT OK. You are so terrified and you shouldn't feel that way in your own home

"Your 'advice' might have worked for you but as someone who works in the service industry while going to college I can tell you that when people try to give me advice about how to run my life, I'll just smile and nod.

She has to be nice to you for her job so she can pay to go to school then get a better job where hopefully she doesn't get as much unsolicited advice. "

"He threatened to lock himself in his study? Is he six?

You know he's probably torpedoed his career in advertising, right? It's a small industry. He's not going to get another job like this. He's a proven liability. I'm sure he knows that too, it's why he's 'not ready yet.' Haha. 

You need to figure out how you and your daughter are going to survive, and pronto. Right now, he's fiddlng while Rome burns.

Do you have family? I'd go there, if I were you. You need a break, some distance, a chance to regain your footing. With a little perspective, you're going to realize how outrageously he's deceived you, stolen irreplaceable time and money from his wife and daughter, and then you're going to become homicidal. You should also get a lawyer, come to think of it.

You need to tell him that he's now in possession of child pornography that he could be prosecuted for.
"&gt; he said no that I can't go alone and that if I do we going to have problems

""Those problems will be nothing compared to the ones we'll have if you keep up this textbook-abuser control freak crap.""

Seriously, do not give into this, or he'll find more and more places where he doesn't think you should be allowed to go. His reaction, the threat of 'we're going to have problems' and his belief that it's ok for him to restrict your movements, are huge red flags. "

"&gt; I'm not an overly religious person at all

Well to me it sounds like you are pretty religious overall. I could call myself a Christian but up to the level that yes i do **want** to believe that there is something superior to me, name it God or however you want.

The way you talk about his relgious parent *""shoving religion down this throat""* makes me believe you think this is a bad thing (to shove it down his throat). Well to me it sounds like this is what you are planning to do. If you want to raise your children in church and Sunday school and teach them that God is the Father etc etc, you are pretty much shoving it down their throat since they will never have the chance to ""choose"" what to believe if they are taught like that since a young age. Little are the cases that it happens, and i happen to be one of them since the country i am from is fairly religious with an official national religion (Christian Orthodox) and pretty passionate about it i would say. But i had the ""audacity"" to question some things and think about everything in a more conscious age since i didn't like the fact that somebody tried to define from my very young stages of life what i will believe my whole life about something so ""important"".

Anyway, if you are so passionate about religion that this can cause a problem in your relationship, then you either need to find a middle solution and compromise or.... i don't know. I like your husband's perspective though; it's good if children chew something first before swallowing it, they usually end up being smart thinking beings. Don't get me wrong, i'm not telling you how to raise your children, none of my business.

Best of luck"

"When I was in school I had a creepy stalker. Well, not only me, but the three girls from my group of friends that went to the same college (none of the guys were in that college with us). This guy was obsesed with us, not as a girlfriend, but as a friend. He said that our group of friend was awesome, really close and funny, he wanted to be part of us. He would wait for us outside of class, tag all of us (including the guy) in Fb's post about friendship and would invite himself to events that we were going, saying that we'll see us there. It was sad, but also creepy.

In that stage of my life I was scared of acting too harsh and danced around the issue for years. I never told him straight up that he was annoying, and I had to deal with that paranoia for too long. Now from time to time he writes me in Fb and ignore him.

This was 5 years ago. 

6 mongs ago I went to an event and met a couple of people. Here in my country we're not that uptight with personal space, but when one of the guys poked me in my belly 5 minutes after meeting him I knew that he was THAT kind of guy. 20 minutes later he was rambling about how edgy he was, how he doesn't have a girlfriend because of darkness that he has and how good he was reading at people because he saw a few youtube videos about psycology. 

If it was the me of 5 years ago I would have danced around the issue, give hints to please leave me alone or endure it for the rest of the night. But the me now? Freaking no! I looked him in the eyes and said ""I don't care about what you're saying. Go talk to someone else"". He was in shock! The crazy thing is that he tried to keep talking and I just keep repeating myself until he finally got the hint and left. Then he went to talk to my husband... probably about the crazy chick that was rude to him and how all the girls are stupid or whatever.

Op, don't be afraid to be direct. At your age is normal to feel like that, but be aware that this kind of people don't go away unless you're direct. And propably the reason why ""all the girls that he knows are obsesed with their boyfriend"" is because that is the excuse that they all gave him so he would leave them alone."
"My BF is great friends with his ex partner of 13 years, going on 10 years of friendship now. They had both checked out of the relationship, basically, she met someone else, life goes on. He was just as much to blame, if there's even blame to be placed. I'm good friends with an ex, going on 20 years. We made an awful couple but great friends. It's clear the romance is OVER on all sides. Not all breakups are bitter."

However, I can see how you feel like she's just along for the ride when she's spending your money the way she is having done so much less of the work. She's immediately taken your money and turned it into ""ours"" without discussion, from the sounds of it, which I would say is kind of odd for most couples (even if they've dated for 2 years).

""AND he was just joking around!"" is the bullshit way to get out of that), but at least the manager did handle it. 

Yes, he will know that you reported him, but if it impacts his care of you in any way again, do not hesitate to *report him again*. I'm serious. If you go back to the clinic in a few weeks and he's a jerk or makes snide remarks or what have you, call the clinic manager back and tell her that apparently you two just don't jive in a patient/caretaker capacity and you'd prefer a different ortho tech next time. If there is no other ortho tech available, ask if you can switch your care to a different facility. Thankfully for a broken toe, you won't be going back to the same clinic for years to come. Hopefully a few more appointments and you'll be done...

"What does he do for a living? How is he able to constantly miss work to talk to you guys? When does he spend time with his boyfriend? If he avoids your fiance, why is he inviting himself over so much? Do Trent/fiance work opposite hours? 

The problem is that it seems like you have not yet actually told Trent that he is making you uncomfortable and you want him to back off. That is the first step. Don't approach his boyfriend until you've actually been direct first. 

Next time he comes over in the morning to try to talk to you while you are on your porch, say: ""Listen, Trent. I'm not a morning person. I'm not up for conversation right now. I want to just sit quietly, drink my coffee, and smoke my cigarette.""

Block him on Facebook and social media. 

Have your fiance keep trying to tell him to back off. Next time something happens, send your fiance (or go together) to knock on his door and tell him, ""Hey - you seem like a decent, friendly guy. But we need some healthy boundaries. We'll be happy to hang out occasionally at neighborhood events, give you a cup of sugar if you need, and all that -- but you are starting to make my fiancee and roommate uncomfortable. How about we give each other a little bit of space for a while, ok?""

One thing I learned in /r/legaladvice is that if you have crazy neighbors, you **really** need to invest in some outdoor security cameras. Shop around and find some decent ones in your price range. Front and back. "
"&gt;That kind of irritated me but, I got over since I won't be in the apartment much longer.

&gt;I was a little upset but I had never placed the plates off limits in the house so I couldn't be furious

&gt;All I asked was that they remember to being them back after. 
I reminded them again to remember the plates and they kind of brushed me off. 

&gt;My boyfriend and I are going to go to the park 

These people, especially Mark, are just irresponsible assholes who treat your stuff with no respect, and you have caved when they do it, presumably because you don't like confrontation, which is the excuse of everybody ever with low self esteem. When they do things that are totally beyond any expected natural boundary, you don't castigate them for it, so they just move on to the next boundary. 

I think you need to establish some self esteem, and understand that you are worth losing your temper for occasionally, especially when people treat you like shit. Stop accepting poor behaviour as your due, you don't deserve it. They should be going to the goddam park to find the plates, because they should be caring more than you do about the fact that they LOST YOUR HEIRLOOMS! I'm mad as hell about what they did, and I think I'm actually showing more anger over their disresepct of you than you do. 

The fact that they, or at least Mark, are shitty disrespectful people, the fact that they treat you and your possessions with disdain is down to their selfish lack of respect for other people, and you're allowing them to do so without fighting back. Thei attitude is not your fault, but your lack of standing up for yourself is something only you can do anything about.

"It sounds like you're looking for some gratitude and acknowledgement. When your wife graduated, I'm sure she got a lot of congratulations coming in, while you were essentially ignored. You're getting beaten down by the daily grind, need a vacation, maybe need to shake things up. 

I think you realize that you've made it through the hardest part. Your wife didn't go through all this trouble to get a degree so she could sit on her ass at home. In the meantime, with her at home, you can save up your vacation days so you can eventually take a real vacation. 

Do you live near family? Friends? If not, have you thought about moving to live near family? Is there any way you could drop the kids off with someone for a few days so you two could have a mini vacation -- not Paris or anything. Just a quick roadtrip or camping or something. 

&gt; There is part time work she can do in her field making some money but she feel that it would be a waste to spend 8 hours working when daycare is going to take 1/3 of what she makes.

I'm not sure this is the best idea. She would still get to keep 2/3 of what she makes. And if she's just starting out in a new field, she needs to gain experience - whether through internships or part-time work. It depends on her field, but lots of jobs don't only want a degree, they want some time spent actually working and gaining experience. It certainly doesn't look worse than a giant gap on her resume. Does she still have access to career counseling through her school?

I don't think it's wrong to want a little credit and appreciation. You've been working super hard. It sounds like you are long overdue for a vacation and some R&amp;R. 

I would sit your wife down. Tell her you're burned out. You love her, you love your family, but you're feeling overworked. Ask her to help you budget and plan for you both to take a long weekend away. Start with a night out. Trivia night at a bar? A movie? Do you have no friends in the area where you live who are willing to babysit for a night? The couples I know who seem to have the best work-life balance have a bunch of friends or family nearby who can help out (in fact, that's where I was last night -- babysitting a 7 month old baby so my friends could have a night out). 

And, finally, think of something nice you can do for yourself on a regular basis. Maybe it's really simple, like taking a relaxing evening walk through the park. Or going to the gym a few nights a week. Maybe it's going to see a movie by yourself that your wife wouldn't want to see. Do you have a hobby you've neglected? 

Better yet, are there community classes in your area? Like, if you've always been interested in painting, you can find a community class that's like every Tuesday for 5 weeks and costs $20. 

You're feeling resentful because you give, give, give. Now, start asking. That's ok to do. "
"I agree with everyone else's comments here about how his comments are very homophobic and you need to deal with them.

I don't really see anyone touching on the aspect that he's the only boy though. I'm wondering if maybe your husband is really excited about having a son. Maybe he's had all these ideas of father/son activities he wants to do when he has kids. And then he finally does have a kid and it's a girl. And then it's another girl. And another girl and another girl. And while I'm sure he loves his daughters completely, he's probably been sad that he may never get to raise a son. And then you guys finally do have a son and he's really excited and now he's worried that he still may never get to have these experiences because what if his son isn't interested in that kind of stuff. He's imagining teaching his son to play catch (but what if he doesn't like catch?) and teaching him about girls (but what if he doesn't like girls?) and having father/son hiking trips (but what if he doesn't like hiking?). 

I'm not saying his reaction is okay. But I'm wondering if it's more than homophobia, and is a lot more about fears that this dream, of being the guy his son really relates to, might be dead."

"Alright let's lay this all out.

- He didn't ask what he was being accused of
- He didn't seem overly concerned that he was essentially being accused of rape. If you weren't guilty, wouldn't you be blowing your top that someone was going around accusing you of something so terrible?
- You've never met any of his old friends/family and he moved far from them
- If Ava was a lying stalker/obsessed with him don't you think she would be much more aggressive in her campaign? One message after years of you two being together and this is the first time you've heard from her?
- People who lie rarely add dates and specific details that can be so easily verified
- He kept his supposed stalker as a friend on facebook. You really can't be that negligent

Honestly Ava's story, from all this information, sounds likely to be true. I think it's time you start asking questions. Ask the police for the report, ask his family if it's true, ask his old friends if you have to. Your comments suggest you think he's innocent, but don't just accept your 'gut feeling' and actually search for answers. Because despite what he did in his youth, it's his actions now that matter. And right now there's a chance he's lying to your face."
"Phone her. Find out the true story, and find out where his relatives really are."
"Well not that innocent. More like hurt a child while underage drinking and wandered off without checking to notice a cut so bad it required stitches. But yes, say something. Expect the kids parents and siblings not to like you anymore. "

"This is only an issue if she says she is Columbian for the purpose of preferential treatment. From what you have said, it doesn't seem like your girlfriend is doing that. She identifies as Columbian because that is the culture she was raised in and not for a nefarious purpose. So no, it isn't an issue."
"In her own words she has a hot temper. And usually the conclusions she arrives at are that I don't love her or that she's not good enough. I tried handling this with a lot of patience but it's not working. I think that's the source of her neediness, the fact that she's very insecure.

I would personally enjoy if she comes but I would feel guilty because I obviously won't be spending as much time with my parents."

Why are you dating someone your kid doesn't have good feelings about? How long have you known this man? You're comfortable leaving him with your child alone? There's a lot of things that could be going on here, but it's not unheard of that men date single moms for access to their kids. I'd seriously reevaluate everything and tread with caution."
"The decision to be in the Army has already been made.  Our decisions have consequences...some good, some bad.  One consequence of your decision to join the Army is that a new relationship will almost certainly not survive.   She's doing the prudent thing for both of you...this can't go anywhere right now.

It's bad timing, accept it, and embrace your future."
"Yep. It's the fact that she doesn't want him that is going to end it.

It's not her libido like she mentioned..... it's this:

""but no matter what I do, I just can't get in the mood for him.""

She is going to absolutely crush him.... actually he is already crushed and this is a last ditch effort to hold onto her. He is going to see her excitement at the prospect of other lovers and ask why not me.... It's going to eat him up inside... throw in the fact that she is going to have a much easier time finding partners (and I will bet he feels like shit and doesn't even want others) and I don't see this relationship lasting longer than five minutes after he is sure she has gone ahead with it and fucked someone else. 

I feel bad for dude.... this is his first real relationship... his first sexual partner. This is going to fuck him up tremendously and is going to have lasting consequences going forward. He will be damaged after this.... If she really is not attracted to him anymore then she should just break up and move on... it's way more kind than this.... it's going to blow up spectacularly."
"Can he still be sorry? Sure, maybe, though the fact that he waited for her to find out from his mother doesn't make it sound like he's doing well so far. But I think he missed his chance to be empathetic when he didn't empathise with OP's pain and prioritised his own excitement over it. 

My beef is mostly with this idea that he didn't understand because he hasn't been through a miscarriage. That's an awful excuse. Something like this isn't an honest mistake, it's a major and deliberate transgression. If he honestly didn't understand, he's got larger issues. "
"I'd be furious. He promised you something, he knows you have damn good reasons -and even if you didn't he still *promised you*.

And then he group-texted everybody. Seriously, he *group-texted* them! I could actually understand if he'd told one or two people that he was close to (in a ""don't tell anyone this, but I really need to share this with you"" way-- he may have had fears of his own that he didn't want to burden you with.

But he group-texted them!"
OP mentioned they don't have money for this added expense. 
But she needs to know that you haven't been. 
"You don't. He's 50+ years old, he's not going to change this. You turn around and walk away, because you don't deserve to be treated like shit so you're not going to be there to be treated that way."
"Hmmm. The toilet is installed. You didnt sneak this into the house without her permission. She doesn't have to use the features and can instead use toilet paper, right? If that's all true, I'd have a 5 minute talk wherein you highlight all of these points and ask her again if there's some other reason she wants the fixture removed (on the off chance she has an unusual fear or something). If there's nothing but a vague apprehension, I'd say this is one of those situations where she probably needs to just use the toilet but not the bidet feature or, if she's unreasonably freaked out by the mere existence of the bidet, she has the option to use another toilet. This is an odd one but not a dealbreaker in my book. And look, if you guys have the money to replace a brand new fixture just because- well that's an option too- it just seems to be a less rational one."
Stop dating high school students and educate yourself about birth control. 
"After reading the comments so far, I feel like I've totally overreacted. I'll move on, and I will definitely appreciate that he pointed it out with good intention. He makes blunt comments often about my overall appearance so perhaps it bothered me more than it should have. Thank you for the advice! :)"
Thank you! It's nice to hear from someone who knows about adoption. I will definitely take what you've said into consideration.
You are a fool. Calm down.
"Come clean. Explain that you fucked up. Get another job devoted to paying it back. **Even if he pays it off for you**, make sure you manage to replace that money into his savings and more, about the amount that he would have paid for you and your friends to go on that trip. Not saying he will pay it off for you, don't get your hopes up.

Grovel to him without expectation. You fucked up big time.

EDIT: As other people have said, cut up those goddamn cards for the love of god."
"And be sticky.  

Everyone hates things that are sticky.  "
"&gt; As for husband, if he would choose money over you, you wouldn't lose much and gain your freedom.

Well, as much freedom as a person with a part-time job and $20K of credit card debt can have.  

And that's not exactly a fair way to characterize that hypothetical decision by her husband.  It's not unreasonable to choose to divorce the kind of person who goes on a booze and drug-fueled bender in Vegas and drops 20 grand.  "
"I dunno, sounds like he got off easy. Others aren't so used to crazy violent people. You might find he gets further punishment simply to try and help you out, if your home life is becoming public knowledge."
"It was a lot of pressure to be by your side with your cancer scare. I'm sure it was even harder being the only support you seem to have.
Ask your doctor or hospital if there are any support groups in your area for those battling cancer. I'm sorry you are having such a hard time, but not everyone is cut out to be that support person.
It's not at all the same, but I was once broken up win when something tragic happened to me, and in a way it was a blessing, because he showed me, explicitly, who he was and what he was capable of emotionally with me. If he hadn't, I would have assumed we were on the same page with out feelings and forged ahead. At the time it was hard, but you can do this. You should do this for you. You should never live your life or fight your battles ""for"" someone else. It's for you, always for you, and people can and will be in your life, but you absolutely need to do what is best for you at all times. 
Good luck with your fight, I hope you can find some support and hope for yourself, soon."
"I think you should make this break a permanent thing.  First, he started your relationship by making you the other-woman.  I don't know how you feel about that, but I personally wouldn't stand for it.  

He totally disregarded your request for space multiple, MULTIPLE times, even though he knows you have something big coming up that you need to focus on.  I mean...he is really, truly sending you snaps of him crying?  Ugh.  Either you are dating a 15-year old stuck in a 33 year-old's body, or he has some mental issues that are not going to lead to a healthy relationship.

"I do this, too, but since I have (TMI) super-heavy flow, and paranoid about smell, I usually wrap my tampon in my used pad, or the pad covering you take off a new one, then shove it in an empty toilet paper roll, then put that in a scented doggie poo baggie (Walmart sells a box of 200 for about $2) and then into the bathroom garbage can."
"&gt;He's alluded to the fact that they married for money and not for love. 

Aaaaand there's the kicker. I'd be surprised if they haven't physically cheated given that statement. I get the feeling this is a situation where she tells him she can't leave husband right now, so he finds a girlfriend to maintain appearances and keep his bed warm in the mean time. But his true loyalties lie with her.

Walk away ASAP with your dignity intact, OP. The more you fight this, the shittier you'll feel when you inevitably pull the plug.

"I feel bad for her, but she's really not worth it.

"Oh, then it's totally okay!  He should use his complete lack of medical knowledge to secretly treat all of her medical problems in the way that he thinks is best."
"Well there's more to this than she's saying.  So you have to get her to open up about it.  While i know it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind, she gave you her employee referral number.  She wished you good luck the day of the interview.

So have a calm conversation with her about this.  Tell her you need to understand this.  You asked her if it was ok and she said it was.  She gave you her employee referral number.  she wished you luck.  So You were following what you thought were her wishes.  If she didn't want you to work there there were plenty opportunities to tell you to stop.  So what's the deal.  Open ended question.  Don't speculate or ask why.  Have her tell you.  

Then decide whether it's important for you to have a relationship with her.  This is a bit controlling.  And it's not like you're going to see her while you're working.  Or is that the point?  Once again don't speculate but if she's that important to you then ask her if she truly doesn't want you there.  Then don't take the job.  But really it's her behavior that;s put the mark on your relationship.  "
"Ask him what he wants out of it. It's perfectly alright to just want casual sex from someone, so there's nothing wrong there... but if you have feelings for him, you probably shouldn't do it.

"My mum did this with me. She told me she didn't care if I left. And it really screwed me up to hear her say something like that. And it wasn't just her who I remained mad at; it was my dad too for being 'on her side' so to speak.

If he can do stuff like that just get him to start writing bits and pieces he can give to music libraries to generate SOME income. In the meantime find jobs in music industries that are admin or for the love of God, teach some kids or adults. He plays trombone, which is excellent, he's not lost in a sea of guitars. If he wants to be a huge song writer he absolutely needs to be in the right place, geographically and socially. "

"I am so so sorry to hear about the loss of your mom. My mom passed away in December, so here is the advice that I've gotten/that has worked for me 

1. don't try and shut down your emotions. I was tearing up constantly and it felt like if I let myself cry fully, I'd just be crying all the time (and I work in an open floor plan office). My therapist told me to let myself cry, go to the bathroom, find a empty conference room and just let it out. It helped so much. I found that if I let myself feel my feelings they didn't seem as overwhelming
2. not the most PG, and not sure what your access is in rural Ohio, but I've started smoking weed to help me sleep (I was having the same issue, constant nightmares and inability to fall asleep). It's honestly made such a difference
3. grieve selfishly. if you want to stay at home and watch every episode of deadliest catch without moving (did this), do it, if you want to go out, do that. There is no wrong way to go through this, just do what helps you. Also, don't feel burdened by other people and their requests/needs. 
4. I mentioned therapy above, I went to a therapist a few times, but honestly haven't found it that helpful. I'm a problem solver by nature, and my struggle with this loss is that it isn't a problem with a solution, it just is. The other piece of advice my therapist gave me was journaling, just write whatever you want for 10 mins per day
5. rely on your friends. I lucked out and have a stellar support system. Find a friend that you can say ANYTHING to. Even if you just need to call them and say what the fuck this is so unfair

Finally, specifically for your ""how do i fully embrace and accept this as real"", you likely won't be able to for a while. I still haven't and its been almost 9 months. What I can say is just take it one step at a time, deal with each event (birthday, holiday etc), one at a time and don't allow yourself to get overwhelmed by thinking too much of the future, at least not right now. 

I really hope some of this helps. 
TL;DR, grieve however you want for now, in the short term do whatever gets you through, and worry about the long term later. 
"
"You're looking for people to say you're right and provide anecdotal evidence to prove it. 

You know what you're doing isn't conducive to a healthy long-term relationship, which is why you posted here. I'm engaged, and I didn't have to post here for validation because nothing felt wrong to me. The fact that you made this post tells me that you know deep down you need to wait.

I get that you're excited. What wrong with a long engagement? Get engaged in a few months and then get married in 2018. That won't set you back at all. And you can be even more sure that this is right for you and for him. Breaking an engagement is a lot easier than divorce. You'll still have quite a few childbearing years ahead of you."
"The problem is that he went behind her back and completely circumvented her wishes. And now rather than take her feelings into consideration, he's doubling down and recruiting her parents against her. Why not try to persuade her instead of going behind her back and putting her in this incredibly awkward position?

That doesn't say ""good man"" to me, it says  ""disrespectful and creepy."""

"Here it is. It has helped me as well. It is truly, a beautifully written piece about grieving.  

""Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.
I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.
As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.
In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.
Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.
Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."""
"I agree with you. There are so many reasons why one wouldn't share it yet. It doesn't mean he's not serious about OP as the other suggested. Telling the story of a trauma often leads to reliving it in that moment and maybe he has a rule for himself that he will only relive that pain at the three year relationship mark or something. I don't know. 

I used to tell my partners at around a year but breakups happen. It is such a painful memory that I hate reliving it over and over for relationships that end. It's happened three times and each time I feel like they have a part of me with them and it hurts because that's a big thing to reveal. 

It doesn't mean trauma victims are not serious about their partners. People are acting like revealing it is free of memories that come with it. Some people wait until the first serious talks of marriage occurs before revealing it.  "
"I wonder what happens when she dies though (sorry, OP), but if these are 'family heirlooms' it's likely she'll have put them in her will... So what happens when that Aunt who never *really* liked OP has inherited this grand ol' clock, and it is nowhere to be seen?

Lying about this now is only likely to actually cause family Armageddon in the future. 

Say: you don't remember it, you've never worked with clocks before and it's not something you would have agreed to have worked on. It's not with you, so where did she put it?
"
How is that in any way shitty? 
"OP, I can relate to your circumstances entirely; you've allowed/chosen to become entirely dependent on this guy to support his career choices and that demands a significant level of trust. He's betrayed that. You can't leave immediately - I get that entirely. 

The fact that you haven't kicked him out or reported him, and are going to counselling suggests you're probably going to stand by him. So I would suggest the following: 

1. Decide for yourself (because you seem unclear) what your boundaries of fidelity are. You seem to suggest that this is just a porn habit and that physical contact is your deal-breaker. That's fine, if that's your perspective but you need to be clear about those boundaries, and you need to ensure he is clear about your boundaries. 

2. He needs to understand this is a potential deal-breaker. Separate beds and no sexual contact. He needs to realise how serious this is - actions speak louder than words. He's broken your trust and he needs to start from scratch to rebuild it. Use counselling to work through your emotions and help you decide if/when he is welcome back into the marital bed. 

3. Get your life in order. Sort out your finances. Get in the best shape of your life. Retrain if needed - do whatever you need to do to enable you to become independent from him. Do this quietly and calmly. It may take months, it may take a couple of years, but you can do this. 

4. Decide whether your marriage is over or if you're going to give him another chance. I'm sorry to say that I think he has cheated on you, and if that is the case, you will catch him again. If this is the case, and he does do this again, you have a royal flush - boundaries were agreed; counselling was sought; your finances are in order and you have the security of knowing you can walk away and support yourself. 

Right now, it seems you're stuck between a rock and a hard place - you want to walk away, but can't. So make an exit plan and execute it. "
"That is an insane thing to do, and it counts as like fifteen separate red flags"
"She took two years to consider whether she was going to come clean, it's hardly too much to take two months to consider whether you can cope with this and move forward, or not.

I wouldn't make any sudden moves.  If you're willing to go to couples therapy, it might help you clarify what's freaking you out here (other than the obvious ""Eskimo brothers with my recently deceased brother"" part) and give you a framework to put the conflict in.  

Also, a couples therapist would draw her out about how *she* was feeling then.  She may have been feeling frightened, trapped, etc.  By your math, you'd been living together a year — perhaps she was under some personal pressure, or feeling like the relationship was ending without her control, or whatever.  The sexual encounter might have been a one-time thing due to some external factor of hers.  It's cheating no matter what, but her argument in extenuation and mitigation might persuade you to try to rebuild.

I would suggest the couples therapy regardless, as you'll want to avoid bitterness and commitment issues if you do break up, and it might help you with some of those things."
They're just teasing you because you have a hot stepbrother and friends sometimes like to give each other a hard time. I really don't think they can be serious. You can them to quit because it grosses you out. Or just joke right along with them -- do any of them have brothers?  This will pass soon.

"Yes! It occurs to me he might know she found the email, but think ""Elle mistakenly thinks I got cheated on her (physically) with Jen, but she's wrong! I'm falsely accused!""  ...like somehow that degree of shit-talking couldn't be a leave-able offense."

You couldn't chip in for the gas, or the dinner we bought last night, you stressed about M spending $X on breakfast, you couldn't pay the entrance fee, and now you need me to pay M back $120, when you know it's for a contract I didn't sign, where for years you'd been benefitting from what should have been my upgrades on it. Are things that bad for you?""

"You have nothing to apologise for. He was very obnoxious to demand to be your plus one in the first place, and you're probably right that he would've ruined your enjoyment of the wedding. Perhaps a long with a few other wedding guests. Let him wallow for a while and try him one more time, sans apology. If he still blanks you, write off what has become a toxic friendship."
"This was so helpful, thank you. I don't even have the words to express my gratitude. It really helps to see what other people have done in this situation. 

His age was the primary reason that the other doctors disagreed with the bipolar diagnosis, plus he didn't really show a history of other symptoms. Based on what my BIL told me though, the psychiatrist that my husband is seeing is going to explore any and all avenues. I think I'm just impatient because I just want to know what caused all this, but I know I need to be patient.

"I don't get it. If your neighbour is already cleaning up the shells, why can't you just disinfect the table and chair you want to use? Even if you can't do that, why can't your boyfriend just go ahead of you and do it? It would take like 2 minutes. Shit. Even if your neighbour didn't clean up the shells, your boyfriend could do it for you in like 5 minutes. Your neighbour is kind of a jerk, but isn't it also kind of your responsibility to handle your own allergies, especially when the solutions are so simple? Peanuts can be anywhere... what do you do if you come across peanut shells/packaging anywhere else? Just do what you do then."
"Yep. The fact that he's having such an extreme overreaction and that he's actually considering divorce tells me that his wife was onto something. 

Also, dude, you didn't notice that ANY of this stuff was gone for an entire year. You do not need this stuff. "
It's also pretty clear his wife doesn't want that to be *the* name. So calling her that would probably be off the table
"I agree with you that the term is thrown around a lot, and isn't always used correctly, but *man* did you pick a bad example to make the point. This is almost a textbook case of it--he's lying and denying things they both know to be reality, and for what purpose other than to make her doubt herself? How is it possibly useful for him to make statements only to retract and categorically deny making them? It's one thing to lie about doing a thing if you believe the other person doesn't know the actual truth, but this is another thing altogether. "

For me I can handle vacuuming everything, but not vacuuming everything and then also putting clothes away, or not making food and putting clothes away, etc. Usually I slack the most on feeding myself and I have an incredibly hard time motivating myself to exercise or really to GO anywhere. But I could also just be stir-crazy (unemployed right now) or something. I have some serious ""executive dysfunction"" and self-imposed deadlines or structure have zero effect."

You acted in anger and are feeling the consequences that's not something she did to you that's normal. You intentionally hurt someone you care about you feel guilt no one is making you feel that way. And you need to be prepared for your sister not accepting your apology or not goin back to normal after ""I'm sorry"" forgiveness isn't a given its a gift.

That's an interesting point. I think maybe that's what I was getting at when I said that I feel that people in a relationship have a responsibility to remove themselves from a situation that might not be good for the relationship. Expressing my feelings about it and then letting him make a judgement call is a good way of doing that together.

That being said, maybe OP's bf has the sweats and just can't understand that some people don't have the same issue."

I feel like ""Roxanne"" is much, much worse in that respect. It's a nice name, and it sucks that people do this, and if they both loved the name, I'd say go for it. But his wife isn't comfortable with it. I think both parents should have veto power. If she says no, that should be enough for him. What if she picked a name he didn't like (for ANY reason)? He should be able to say no. A child's name is something both parents should agree on. Ex: My dad wanted to name me ""Shawna."" My mom liked the name until she found out it was also the neighbor's dog's name (weird name for a dog, if you ask me). Is that a silly reason to reject a name? Kind of (and I actually think it's a nice name). But it's as valid as any other reason, including, ""I just don't like it."" OP is being stubborn and unreasonable here."

No kidding. I grew up in Southern California where Spanish is very useful. Chances are any children I have will grow up in England and I damn sure will still teach them Spanish. I could be in the middle of Italy and I would teach them Urdu if I knew it. ANY language no matter where you are is an advantage. Not teaching Spanish in America if you have the opportunity is nuts to me.

Her developing a bad attitude and resentment of the dog situation (which does impact her and does communicate a lower value of her and that you dont respect  her time/life)  is natural. People portraying her as psycho are pretty off the mark.

Be more responsible about scheduling and the  comments will go away."

"Before you cut things off with your sis, try establishing formal boundaries, and laying out the consequences of her breaking them.

Maybe she's a narcissist.  Maybe she's just a normal but awful person that you shouldn't make plans with in the thunder-y months.  Or maybe she has trouble understanding emotion.  Who knows?

Tell her 'I do not want to ever hear you suggest I put down Rover again.  If you do, I will immediately leave/hang up/kick her out and you will not have any contact with me for 1 week/2 weeks.'  *Then follow through on your consequences.* Start hanging out with her again.  If she does it again, make it a month.  

Establish boundaries in other situations as well.  If you're uncomfortable with how she talks about people, address it using 'I' not 'you' statements.  'I'm not comfortable criticizing Jane's new curtains, lets talk about something else.'  If she continues, leave/hang up.  Consequences.

Or you could just go no-contact with her.  But if you want to try to preserve the relationship, try boundaries first.  If she still acts like a dick, then you are free to dump her."

The question I would ask yourself is this: is there room in your life for a boyfriend currently? Genuinely think about it.
"I think the above poster is spot on, on both points. 3 1/2 is still super young and she needs a lot of attention and care from you. I'm a step mom, and never had a child of my own, but I came into their lives around that age. Mine are now 11 and 14 and in a lot of ways it does get easier - they start developing interests of their own, they have friends, hobbies, school. Just the hands on time commitment on your part will be less, and they will be able to have rational and actually interesting conversations with you. 

My mom has said she liked us better the older we got and I totally see why. My mom was depressed most of our childhoods and if she were raising us today, there is NO way she'd be doing all that dumb Pinterest shit. Honestly I see that on my Facebook feed and roll my eyes too. But she took great care of us and that is what mattered. 

I guess my concrete advice is, find things you love to do and see if you can begin sharing those with your daughter, so you have stuff you love to do together. And try to stop comparing your feelings to other moms."

"The age of their brother takes a normally uncomfortable situation and makes it really inappropriate. I think you need to make it clear to your roommates and your sister that she will not be spending anymore time around their brother. As for her visiting the apartment in general, that may or may not be something you allow to happen in the future. You have to decide what her intent was and if you can continue to have a close relationship with someone who has those intents. Personally, as a educator of kids in that age range, I'd be really reconsidering my opinion of her and setting new boundaries until it was clear that she was either purely joking or just oblivious that adult women should not sexualize teenage boys and made behavioral changes to knock that shit off. We have a bad habit of being blind to women as ""predators"" (think of all those ""hot"" female teachers who had a male student ""lucky"" enough to be their boyfriend or sexual partner) but, if you do a gender reversal, it becomes way clearer what a logical reaction would be. Perhaps this might be a topic you discuss with her to get a better understanding of her viewpoint. "

&gt; He will eventually hit you in anger if you stick around long enough.

I wouldn't say it's a given that he *will*, but I completely agree with the sentiment. OP has to see this as an attitude he has toward *other beings*, not just his cats. People don't compartmentalize kindness - for the most part, people who are capable of being unkind in one scenario are capable of it in many scenarios.

He has shown that, if he thinks he has reasonable cause, it's okay to hit another living being. He almost certainly understands that he's causing his cats pain. He's prioritizing his own anger and his rules (a rule that doesn't even have anything to do with protecting the cat's safety or any other practical consequence, besides getting a little hair on the couch!) above the happiness, safety, and psychological intactness of a cat.

Do not expect this attitude to be limited to cats. This is not about the cats, it's about his view of *himself* as entitled to behave this way towards other living creatures. This is not okay and it has serious implications for OP's safety."

"Using the other bathroom is not a passive aggressive stunt. She is addressing her own problem successfully.

She may *also* be passive aggressive, but her choice to shit in a bathroom where she is comfortable and happy is 100% legitimate.

Except, it clearly does affect her, or there would be no question here. You, and OP, may feel it shouldn't, but it clearly does.

In a small way, because she is not comfortable with it, never agreed to it being there, and now uses a different bathroom to maintain her own comfort—which apparently annoys her boyfriend to no end! That's a rather small impact, and she has adjusted her behaviour to cope successfully with it.

The much more serious impact is that it's an obvious and present example that her partner doesn't give two shits about her agreement when he makes a rather large and impactful purchase for their home."

Walking or taking public transportation is often a huge hassle and it takes three times as long to get anywhere. A good chunk of the people who take public transport or walk are doing so because they can't afford the convenience of a car. The city is simply set up for driving, not walking. 

Maybe the boyfriend grew up in one of these places. Maybe he got picked on for not having a car as a teenager. Maybe he's been stranded somewhere and had to walk ten miles to the next bit of civilization. Having a car means freedom and security to some people, and giving that up can be hard even if it makes more sense not to drive. "
"To piggy-back off this, my folks had a similar issue and solved it in the following way:

My brother was notoriously picky as well. In our house, we would have main meals and snacks in between. My brother found the loophole that if he didn't eat dinner, he'd just eat more snacks. 

My mom put a stop to this by making him ""clean his plate"" in the following way. If he ate only a small amount of his dinner, she'd put it in the fridge. If he came around later asking for snacks, she'd pull the plate of food out of the fridge. Rinse and repeat until the food is gone.

To clarify, we did try to stick to foods he liked (hated carrots but liked beans, etc.) so it wasn't mean. He just no longer got chips and dip as his snack. "
"No, he's not the kind of asshole that expects his wife to make dinner and clean house, he's the kind of asshole that expects the world to revolve around him."
"It didn't work the first time, so let's try it two more times!


Yikes.  "
"My best guess is this... this has nothing really to do with it. It's just that she's been with you since she's 21 and she wants to try someone -- practically anyone -- new. So the big allure of this guy isn't that he's hot or interesting or even good in bed... it's that he's new, he's into her, and he gives her the thrill of falling in love (or lust or whatever) all over again.

Sadly, that's probably all it comes down to."
"Well, Kiara isn't an Indian name.  It's an Irish name."
"I feel so sorry for you and your past and I wish it could have been better. I know this may sound harsh but can't you just leave him or tell your other siblings to take care of him? You tried getting him treatment in rehab and he is refusing so I would be done with him. 

You need to look after yourself first and make sure you are both physically and mentally safe before you look after anyone else. "
"And free childcare would definitely be contributing a lot. So she either doesn't get paid for childcare and doesn't pay rent, or she pays rent and also gets paid for childcare. "
"Ok, first off, you did not cheat!  Being on a break doesn't mean time freezes.  You have a life to live. Nobody gets to dictate someone else's life like that.

Second, what exactly has Madeline been doing these last six months, on the break she insisted on?  Probably fucking or at least trying to fuck other guys.  
She probably only reached out cuz she heard you were possibly dating somebody.  This whole ""break"" BS is an incredibly selfish demand on her part. I get needing a week to get one's head straight, but SIX MONTHS?!!  Fuck that!

In all seriousness, dump Madeline.  Even if things don't work out with Jean, you are better off without her and her selfishness.  You deserve better than Madeline.

"I have a couple friends who live right by DisneyLand. One of our favorite things to do is go to DisneyLand, hang out all morning, and then at lunch duck out to go to the closest alcohol-serving restaurant in Downtown Disney, right outside the gates. 

We pound as many drinks as we can and then head back into the park. It's a blast. "
"He was kinda cheating on you. Flirting with a girl, saying he wanted to give her a massage, almost meeting her multiple times. That's cheating. That's an affair

And him mentioning polyamory? That's him wanting to be able to screw her without feeling guilty. 

You're not paranoid. He's been thinking about and kinda planning on cheating on you for probably your whole relationship "
"Sorry, but most of the comments in this thread are absolutely horrendous. People are actually encouraging you to be a shitty friend? Wow.

This is what you do: you sit her down and have a frank discussion - you explain what you've heard from her coworkers and bosses, you tell her you've worked extremely hard to get where you are and that if you were to recommend her, your ass is on the line as much (if not more) than hers. You'll be doing her a favour in the long run.

'Little white lies' like the ones people are suggesting always have a way of revealing themselves. Plus, you're saying she desperately needs the job, I don't know about you but I'd have a difficult time looking her in the eye if I'd lied about something like that."
Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew. They go to the same uni!?  Wtf!?!?!?!?!  Dude come on. Your kids are just trying to keep their dad around youre deluded. 
"He most likely won't pay, especially since his mother isn't forcing him to, but you need to stop allowing him into your house and around your kids."
"This.

Main reasons I want to leave:
People call the cops on me for mundane shit.
Racism is seriously a problem and I deal with it everywhere.
The biggest benefit I thought of moving was the privacy, but I had more privacy in NY.

Secondary reasons:
I also miss the night life, the parties, the fun, the fact that you used to do more than just sit around and gab with the girls at your book club (I would NOT use those exact words).
"
"This was a second date question for me.  Luckily my wife felt the same way (child free).  19 years later we are child free and very happy with the decision.

If having kids is a deal-breaker for you, address it ASAP otherwise you are wasting her time and your time."
"&gt; I chickened out at the key moment.

I'm confused by what this means? Every moment is a moment to tell him. Tell him now. Hotels/motels are open 24 hours, not just at breakfast time :/"
"OP's husband is still being really immature about this. He said he ""died inside"" and his daughters are corrupting the son.

This was done once, at home. "
Girl I could have answered the question before even reading the whole post just by looking at the age difference.
Yeah seriously. I expected OP to be like ok give me a second and maybe take 5-10 minutes to finish but an hour? Jfc
"I have a daughter and another on the way. Would I like for them to become lawyers, engineers, doctors, etc? Sure,  if that's what they want. But I won't be disappointed if my girls decide to be homemakers. I want to see them happy. That's the beauty of being a woman this day in age.. we can CHOOSE to do what we want. ""Aiming high"" and ""becoming more"" are great but the traditional feminine roles are still perfectly fine. As for being a role model, by being a good aunt/sister/SIL, she is showing your kids that family is important and to be kind and help others. Those are great things for them to see! 


The kids don't need to know the details about their aunt's marriage or her partying lifestyle anyway. They're too young to understand it and it's also not their business. Unless there's any concern of her possibly harming or neglecting your children in some way, I'd leave it alone and welcome your new brother-in-law to the family."
"Youre young, admit you fucked up and move on."
"Seems to me like you guys were over as soon as you kissed someone else. She saw it, you tried to talk to her, she told you to kill yourself, she left with and fucked her friend, and now shes not returning your calls and is supposedly dating her friend. Sounds to me like she's done and at that point she can do whatever she wants. Doesn't sound too harsh to me tbh."
There's no chance that the person who runs the group's Facebook page is the same person that is OP's boss. 
How was Burning Man this year?
"You tried to back out knowing what was going to happen but then decided not to. So you chose your team over your husband. 

You chose this knowing the consequences, and knowing you would be put in a situation where you had to say no... and then you didn't say no.

You chose to put yourself in this situation, and then you chose to go through with it. "
"Your boyfriend is trickle truthing you. I would give him one last chance to tell the truth, but do not reveal to him everything you know. Let him tell his version of the events and then compare it to the information you know and look for inconsistencies. If you tell him everything you know, you give him the opportunity to come up with a story that matches those facts. Whatever he's doing, it sounds shady. Trust your gut instinct.

As for the lease, most landlords will let you break the lease if you give them two month's rent, but both you and your boyfriend would have to request this since you are both on the lease. You can always choose to leave the condo by yourself, but you will be liable for any unpaid rent or damages. Talk to your landlord and see what your options are. You might be able to make an arrangement where you pay half the remaining rent directly to the landlord and avoid your boyfriend altogether."

"Don't regret, the wedding hasn't happened yet! If you invite them for sure he'll cause a scene one way or another. If you uninvite then there will also be some hell to pay but at least not on the exact day of your wedding. My sister made the mistake to include our (equally shitty) dad and he made it the Nelson Show (names changed obv) all things Nelson and also go eff yourself everybody. Please please please reconsider their invite. You deserve to be happy on your wedding day and nothing is set in stone yet."
"&gt; He brings his fiance and this is the first time I'm meeting her.

To be honest, this is probably it. Had you ever expressed interest in actually meeting his fiance? You guys seem to live within driving distance of each other, no mutual friends, and you just recently met his to-be-wife.
"
"&gt;. There’s nothing stopping us from buying a house here and finishing out our decent careers where we are, but I feel like that’s just going through the motions and then dying off when we get old.

You sound like you are mourning the life you think you should have instead of enjoying the one you do.

I am not sure when you guys made these ""life choices"" but I can tell you that you can't just decide something when you are 20 and stick to it your whole life.

Situations change and so do the choices you make.  The good news is that these current choices aren't permanent either.

Once her sisters start having kids their time to spend with their child free sister will dwindle.  Over time she will probably tire of her job.

Are you actually unhappy right now or just impatient?"
"Thank you for putting that so concisely.  OP's sister has some really dysfunctional behavior going on, and him not letting her slide is the first step toward a healthy relationship."
"He *did* act entitled to something here. He *did* get mad at you for not agreeing with him. *He did* try to embarrass you into doing what he wanted done. He **did** get so mad that you were almost *scared of him*.

That's not one event. It's multiple events. It's a pattern of events. It's a problem. Then, to prevent him from having any more control or influence over anything, *you did something incredibly nice with the money*. You didn't spend it on some 9000 dollar dinner for yourself. You didn't do something you wanted with it. You freaking donated it to charity. You literally couldn't manage to be bad even when you tried to be bad. In your 'worst' moment here you did something 'vindictively' *nice*.

Put aside the feelings for a moment and really think about the just the actions here. What your boyfriend did was rude and mean. Now you're scared to tell him because you're afraid he's going to be mad again that you didn't do what he wants. That's a **huge** red flag. You should never feel that way about a good partner. "
"It's not a matter of being angry, it's that forgiveness doesn't have to come with permission. 

If the debate was ""should I treat her politely,"" I'd take your point. But forgiveness can't come until a person is ready,  and it doesn't have to mean opening up your heart and mind to someone with neither remorse nor ability to consider the perspective of someone else, not even someone they were married to.

I can only be friends with people I trust, and there is no sign of trustworthiness in this woman. Beyond the substance of what you wrote, the implications are that not only should OP forgive,  she should embrace and welcome into her life a person who casually and without remorse destroyed two families. 

This woman probably wants to befriend OP so she can validate her actions and sweep them under the rug. Can you imagine what the ex-SIL would feel? What about the relationship with OP's brother's existing children? 

I agree, that OP should seek to forgive these people. She shouldn't carry around anger or resentment. But there are other factors also in play which cannot be resolved by her participating in pretending the betrayal and upheaval never happened, or that it is okay. "

"I've heard that kind of shit SO much that my default reply is ""Good thing I'm a Woman. I've never claimed to be a lady."" 

It sounds like you need to upgrade, sweetie. :( You're only 6 months in, so it's not like you've got to worry about child support and alimony or whatever, but you get enough disrespect from the people you work with who are supposed to be on your professional team. Don't put up with it from your own bench. I think the best way to put it to him is your own line from above: ""That's the type of sexist bullshit I have to deal with all the time at work, and now my boyfriend is spewing this shit in front of people.""

He either loves and accepts everything about you exactly as you are, including the job you love, or he doesn't. And you deserve someone who does."
"As you get older your own tendencies to hoard will get stronger and harder to control. 

Hes clearly ok with hoarding.

If you marry him and have kids; the two of you will be forever in a terrible mess. Two unorganized people who struggle with hoarding plus a busy life equals bad juju.

"are you trying to insinuate that your son is blowing this out of proportion, because that's the impression I'm getting.  (I figure that's why you mentioned he lifts)"
"Tell her everything, just as you wrote it and as it happened.

They're trying to see how far they can push you. Stop it immediately by showing them you won't tolerate it. I am so incredibly sorry about your father, dealing with these shitheads probably isn't making it much better. "
"&gt; She has always prioritized living life to the fullest and experiencing new things. I just feel like I threw away so much of my life and the person who I want to be my life partner doesn't want to make the same sacrifices.

Why do you say you ""threw away so much of [your] life""? It doesn't sound like you want her to find her own success; you sound resentful that she wasn't miserable like you were. Are you even happy with *your* career choice?

There's nothing wrong with wanting an equally ambitious partner, mind you. Everybody has different priorities re: what they expect or hope for in a partner, and professional identity + income is a common one. Maybe find yourself another doctor if career and exactly equal financial footing are supremely important to you (but be aware that time commitment wise it may be difficult to actually spend *time* together when you are both in such demanding occupations). Also be realistic and understand that most people outside of medicine, or the upper echelons of law and finance, aren't going to make as much as you.
"
"&gt;Yeah, so now you want to make him work even more. Who wants to be told that after supporting their family for 8 years, their reward to is to start doing housework?

You don't see the hypocritical bullshit in this....?"
"So... If you buy a house, will you only allow her to use 10% of it? If you go on holiday together, will you send her home after two days whilst you enjoy another three weeks abroad? When you go shopping, is she only allowed to eat 10% of the food bought?

Honestly, what the fuck are you going to do with all the money you're earning? You can't buy back the decade you spent to get qualified. Are you going to take yourself on fancy dinners, holidays, adventures, but leave her out because she didn't suffer for that money like you did? Are you going to live in a crappy apartment for the rest of your life to spite her for suggesting you move somewhere nicer?

Or are you going to dump her for someone who's earning a comparable amount? You'll never see this spouse because she'll be working just as hard as you are. You'll have to hire staff to cook and clean for you because neither of you will have the time. And when you do spend time together, you'll have no idea what to say because you'll both be too tired, and you'll have nothing to talk about except work. 

Life is made to be enjoyed and to be shared. If you don't want to enjoy it with her, then dump her. "
Exact same thing happened to me while I was overseas. She had also been sick for a long time and family insisted I not come back for the funeral (they would have been pissed if I did). I visited the grave-site upon my return to pay my respects. 
You won't be able to do *anything* for *anyone* if your company is run into the ground because of bad hiring decisions.
I think this whenever I use this site too.  I figure I am probably less critical of other bodies.
Not enough to complain on the internet to strangers.
"Yeah, I think so. How else would you stop her? Why should a parent get to make unilateral alterations to a child's body, purely for the sake of cosmetics?"
You hit the nail on the head. I feel just like an accessory. This is not the first time. I've told him in the past it seems like I'm his safety blanket. When I wanted to move an hour away for school he told me we would have to break up because he can't handle long distance relationships. I'm there to make him feel like he always has somebody but he can't treat me the same in return. 
"I think you do not have a grandma problem, you have an anxiety problem because this sounds exceptionally minor.  I would switch your focus to that."

"Neither of which are his fault, both of which are a pretty serious betrayal of him, and both of which could have had lasting effects on his viewpoint toward engagement and marriage."
This isn't normal or okay on any level and will only get worse. Your boyfriend is being controlling and mentally abusive. You need to leave and get your life in order and let him deal with his own issues.
"OP, I agree with this. Your stepfather might have better resources to fight your mom than you will. Don't give up hope, though. Please keep fighting for your brother."
"Well said, well written.  I have a feeling OP isn't going to like any of these responses.  "
"Your mother gave birth to a child, regardless of the circumstances, that is her child. 

Do you have any idea how deep a mothers love is? Not seeing him every day must be so hard for her. That woman has every right to see him and I think it's disgusting that she has to hide it at all. I realize she messed up, she had an affair and that sucks, but she has to hide the fact that she's seeing the little boy she gave birth to from your family? That's shameful."
"This isn't true. OP, please only take advice from lawyers. "
And his parents will love him again. It's the perfect crime
"""Counseling"" is like the knee jerk reaction for /r/relationships - I swear we should just have a bot come by and post that - but you guys are great candidates.

But *not about the stuff* - about your 5 and 10 year plans, and where you see yourselves in the future.  In other words, is this JUST about tidying up? Or is Chelsea going through a process of ""rejecting"" the life she may feel that she's forced herself into?  WHAT'S BEHIND her compulsion to throw out stuff?

Two friends of mine used to work excellent jobs and they each lived in nice yuppie apartments. When they got to talking more, they realized that they both shared a common fantasy - to give *all their stuff away* and travel the US in an RV. But not for a summer. For life.

So about five years ago, they sold it all and took to the road and got married. She is a writer, so she IS working, and he works odd jobs on occasion. 

I also know two families with children that did this for a couple of years. Both families are teacher families, so they homeschooled for 2 years.

It would be good to know if something like that is behind Chelsea's minimalist streak.
"
"Agreed. And it needs to be a good reason not to talk to her anymore. Not ""I'm leaving for x place"" because you don't want her hoping for him to come back etc. It needs to be a reason that he doesn't want to talk to her anymore. Like he's in love with someone else. It'll hurt her but not as much as it would if you tell her the truth. 

Don't catfish people anymore, regardless of good intentions. Let this be a lesson to you."
This is not your problem  Go no contact.  He has to want to help himself.
He wants her to apologize for ruining his fantasy before he'll talk to her. Not for saying she knows what he's feeling. She should not apologize for shutting down the threesome because she was uncomfortable. 
"&gt;p.s. And you're writing this on the 15th anniversary of 9/11. Oh, the irony.

"He is blatantly abusing you and your family. He probably does the same to her. She refuses to see reality. She is in a severely emotionally abusive (possibly physically in the future) relationship.

You will lose her. You *want* to lose him. Mark my words, he will start isolating her from her loved ones one by one, until nobody really talks to them anymore.

Sounds like you've already tried to talk to her (and him) and neither one is willing to face reality. That is all you can do. If she refuses to accept help / advice from her own family, all you can do is do your best to minimize the damage from his presence in your life by ignoring him, and not engaging him socially where possible. 

I've been in this exact situation (with a close cousin who was my MOH; we haven't spoken in 2 years) so I feel for you. It's not easy and it's not clear-cut. But as long as you've made your feelings clear to you SIL, you can do absolutely nothing."
"First off, find the condom size that fits you. It either breaks because it's too small, or because there is too much friction. if it's friction, use lots of lube, it smoothes everything out. 

Birth-control pills are not a guarantee of not getting pregnant due to the fact that a lot of people eventually forget to take one or more at some point.

And, lastly, having raw sex 1-2 days before period is NO different from having sex on any other day before, after, or during period. You still have the same chance of getting her pregnant.

To get into the habit of using the condom, and finding the right one, start masturbating with condoms. No, i am not joking. Use different sizes, with different lubes etc, until you find the right ones."
"I think he's getting downvoted because OP already disclosed that she was fine with a 60/40 split, so she probably knows that he needs a little more, but unless their size gap is very big 80/20 seems rather unfair. "
"Sounds like she has a competitive streak.

If its making you uncomfortable, its time to have an honest conversation about what you both consider acceptable levels of pda."
"Well, 18 years is a whole generation if we are being honest, he could be your father easily. All I'll say honestly is that he may view you as naive, what woman wouldn't want an older man. That kind of shit, already being possessive and worrying where you are. It sounds like a slippery slope, surely there is someone who would treat this whole arrangement better than he has before it's even begun. That's just my two cents."
"Just have your mom tell him he has one.  They talk about uncomfortable stuff. This is uncomfortable stuff. 

Then he can decide what to do. "
"Yes but if you say that you are absolutely fine with guests staying over, I think she will struggle to see the difference (seeing as she didn't see any reason to tell you in the first place, I'm not saying there isn't a difference). Let her know that you're all paying X amount of money to stay there, that you all agreed to live with 6 people not 7 and that it is unreasonable to have someone else practically living there while free from responsibilities."
"First off, it's very, very unlikely that this ring is worth anywhere near 100k to anyone who would buy it. It's likely *insured* at 100k, but it would have to be something amazing to be worth anything close to that as described. Your sister is asking *you* about it which means she hasn't had it appraised, or worse, has and is trying to get more than it is worth out of you. I would find out what it will really sell for, likely far less than expected, and work from there. Worst case, she sells it, and for the low cost of a family heirloom, you get someone who is kind of a tool out of your life."
"No, the request to not share photos is not a red flag.  

the fact that the couple turned out to have other issues does not mean that that random bit was a red flag for it any more than the fact that they drank milk is a red flag.  

You are allowed to request whatever you want, *and people who aren't the parents must comply*.  MIL is allowed to find requests as odd as she wants, but that's completely irrelevant. finding them odd does not excuse her from the requirement to comply. There are no blurred lines here. Parents gave a direct order, she agreed, and she lied and did it her way anyway.  Such a person does not get the right to see the child.  "

He risked his unborn child's health and safety by cheating on you. A lot of STI's can have terrible affects on fetuses and babies.
"Shit, I was gonna say like find Pope Francis or something."
"Ew, that's obnoxious. Sounds like you dodged a bullet."
That doesn't really answer my question. Why is it such a bad thing? If they keep to themselves for the most part then why are you getting so angry about it. If you can't keep your emotions in check then that's on you. That's not your roommates fault.

"Seriously, this is how my oldest kid felt when his brother started going to school too...It was not his own private special place anymore.  

But he was seven and he got over it real quick.

"When I was in my early 20s, I was staying at my sister's house a couple of states away and a FWB that I had feelings for (I know I know) and who lived a couple towns over had agreed to come over for dinner. I planned out what to make, went to the grocery store, etc. etc. etc., I was SO DAMN EXCITED, and then when the time came for him to come over, he didn't show. Just straight up stood me up. I holed up in my sister's room out of embarrassment and frustration.

A while later, our friend, her housemate, who was about a decade older and wiser than me, came upstairs, knocked on the door, came in, and tossed a big bottle of lambic on the bed and said, 'Who needs boys when you've got booze?' and left without another word.

Just what I needed at the moment, nothing more, nothing less. 10/10 friend."
Maybe don't send sexual snapchats if you don't want your partner to check and see if you've carried that over to other avenues.
"I'm operating on the assumption that she's not too bright/maybe a little desperate and is only getting her information from him about his behavior. Maybe some willful denial in there too. 

And shit yeah, wtf does that guy do for a living that he can keep flying to Europe so much and take 50 day vacations?"
"I can almost hear him telling her this. ""I love you and value this relationship, so I'm really upset that you decided to break up with my by cheating. But I guess I have to respect your opinion and leave."" "
"So your girlfriend has a job shes very serious about but you don't respect. You made a joke about her competence in front of her boss and you're surprised she's pissed? 

You describe everything as you being the right everywhere, up to even talking about your 'right' as a client to talk to her boss. I don't think what your gf did in response was particularly helpful but you can easily avoid it in the future by staying the hell out of her workplace as she so clearly wants. "
"Seriously. If anything, give ol dad $500 smackaroos and call it a day.

Don't really do that, OP. Tell them all to fuck right off."
"That's.... not ok. He's an adult, he should pay rent. He's using you, whether both of you realize it or not. 

This entire situation is fucking ridiculous. He needs to pay rent. He's 24. I just can't wrap my mind around the fact that you let him live with you for free."
"Look! A man in this sub who actually has some game and knows how to get laid. Nothing will make me feel cheaper and less sexy than ""So, are we having sex?!"""
Are we seriously recommending giving a spare key to a bf of 4 months? I don't see anything wrong with giving a boss that you're close to a spare key for emergencies. It's the rest of her relationship with the boss that's weird
"I think your brother are more ""razzing"" you than trying to be really mean to you. That is how a lot of guys bond with each other. I don't think this is them really trying to make you feel bad, just trying to joke around. 

Have you ever said something like this to them:

""Listen guys, I am actually a little insecure about my eyes, so I'd appreciate if you didn't make fun of them. It's making me more self conscious, and it's making me not want to be around you guys.""

It's kind of an awkward conversation, but it's worth bringing up. If you have that conversation and they keep doing it, then it is absolutely okay to lean on your sisters more. This behaviour is usually something people grow out of as they head to their mid 20s, but apparently not for your bros. Might still happen though.

"I think it was mostly that I stayed with my ex out of convenience and managed to justify my cheating somehow because the relationship may as well have been done anyway?

I write as a hobby, hang out in some online writer's forums and the like, and people like this (wanting to be successful authors but have no idea how to go about it) are *extremely* common. I think a good chunk of them are young teenagers, but I've seen older people think like that too. Mostly ignorance, though there's also appeal in the concept that you can get rich and famous without putting much effort in. Hell, there's a whole business of fake publishers made to make money off of these people... Which makes me realize, /u/throwaway829zba, keep an eye out for her falling for scams. Modeling scams are so common, and your wife is the perfect candidate to fall for 'em. (rule of thumb, if they ask you for money upfront, it's a scam.

It's really irritating in general when someone else acts like they know how a person *feels* better than they do.  I'd nope my way out of a relationship over just that one issue.

It's okay that you don't like it, but you cannot tell her its effects on her, because you don't know that.

Since she smokes every day (and pretty much has since you've known her) you have no clue whether she's more or less action when not smoking.  

She may be in the process of distancing herself from you, from the sound of it.  Your dislike of weed has been clearly stated, you both have decisions to make."

"Yep I was gonna say the same thing. This sorta attitude about people from the younger brother, is what's going to land you later on a really good partner down the line.

As for older brothers you may not be able to get them to back off becasue they are morons who don't understand how to show basic care. Talk to the younger brother and let him know that you're proud of him and that older brothers have no idea what they are saying/doing. I'm surprised they are acting the way they are. I'm younger than them by a year or so and even i'm rolling my eyes. "
"I totally agree. I didn't want to comment saying this for fear of down votes for using the race card but I'm really afraid OP's gf's motive was partially that. ""Oh he's from a subservient, caring culture, surely he'll do this for me!""

Also the age gap. I wonder if this could be equated to the ""older man, younger woman"" trope. Maybe she's with a younger man because she couldn't get away with hr manipulative, entitled behavior with men around her age?

Or it could just be extreme cross-cultural miscommunication and I'm just projecting way over the line here."

"&gt; Hasn't offered to pay for it yet.

She might be banking - literally! - on you waiting for her to offer to pay you back anything. Stop waiting and just tell her, ""hey, the ticket for the bus and half the room is €X, could you have it for me tomorrow? Thanks!"" and add in that the ticket for the tour was €X - but you might have to concede that one. Think of it as the price of learning how shitty a friend she is and that you need to stop paying for anything that isn't for you only.

"Ah, but actually, the case establishes that the house is haunted as a matter of law: 

&gt; Whether the source of the spectral apparitions seen by defendant seller are parapsychic or psychogenic, having reported their presence in both a national publication (Readers' Digest) and the local press (in 1977 and 1982, respectively), defendant is estopped to deny their existence and, as a matter of law, the house is haunted.

""As a matter of law, the house is haunted"" is my favorite line ever. 

However, the judge (justice?) takes your point:

&gt; From the perspective of a person in the position of plaintiff herein, a very practical problem arises with respect to the discovery of a paranormal phenomenon: ""Who you gonna' call?"" as a title song to the movie ""Ghostbusters"" asks.... [T]he notion that a haunting is a condition which can and should be ascertained upon reasonable inspection of the premises is a hobgoblin which should be exorcised from the body of legal precedent and laid quietly to rest.

"If you want to try this, go blonde, not brown. Brown will absolutely look like you're trying to hide, and you're going to look like a redhead with brown hair on top.

"I didn't really get that vibe from him at all, I instead had the impression that he was just trying to set the scene of how fancy this all was.

"I don't think this is that wrong. I'm a 21 year old woman and i don't really see that this is any different to a man buying you a drink in a bar, for example. You didn't ask him to, but it's here now and it's free. 
You mention repercussions - what repercussions? Worst case scenario (similar to the man in the bar) is that she gets asked on a date or maybe he gets innapropriate cause he thinks she's more into it than she really is. It's probably safer for her behind a screen anyway. 
Essentially, I think it's fine as long as no actual harm is coming to her. Sometimes men do dumb things to attract female attention, and being showered in video game things is better than being showered in rohypnol."
"He was in another room and when I came in to check on him he woke up. So, no, I didn't."
"Sometimes the original intent doesn't matter. ""He eventually apologised"", according to OP, and at first he didn't seem to think anything wrong with it. Even after she (rightfully) blew up about it. 

REGARDLESS of intent, if you do something your SO reacts that strongly to, you should immediately acknowledge your mistake. Because regardless of intent, at that point it has become a mistake, because you're hurting the person you love. The fact that he doesn't seem to be able to comprehend that, makes it more than just one mistake. The fact that he made multiple mistakes, makes it malice. And that, for me, would be a dealbreaker.

1.- She doesn't want sleeping pills, but I'll give them to her anyway...

"Seriously. I visited a friend recently for a long weekend. She and her (third) husband are also very pleasant to each other, and it was obviously not for show. Her first two were terrible, just terrible. She took a decade off between them and worked on herself, then found someone that treats her with respect. I left there just marveling at how well they worked through making plans, minor disagreements over the order in which to do things, etc. They listened to each other's sides, then considered each other's position, then compromised. It was very nice to be privvy to. Like, woah, there ARE reasonable people out there!"
"Wow. If I were your friend of 17 years, knowing you, having your back, only to be dropped like hot garbage as soon as your fucked up husband decides you aren't enough of a servant to his needs... I gotta say, I'd be pretty hurt. I'd be concerned about you. By the way, you tried to plead the case absolutely wrong. He didn't want you to go because of the friendships, not the event.

Reach out to your friends. Tell them about this. Watch the horror on their faces when they realize how entirely and completely you internalize your husband's horrid behavior and insecurities, as if somehow perfect, model behavior on your part could heal his wounds. You say during your first months you weren't sure you would even last because he'd project all his insecurities into you... and then you never mentioned how you got over it or whether he ever stopped. And sounds like he didn't... sounds like he just tries to control his emotions by manipulating you, which is unhealthy and a cause for concern.

The fact you love your husband doesn't mean you should agree to whatever bullshit he concocts in his head. It's the ol' ""If your husband told you to jump off a cliff to prove your love to him, would you?"" Don't. Love is not enough. Love is *never* enough. It's crucial, but it's not enough. Your husband lies to you, takes his frustrations out on you, tries to control you. Your relationship is far from stellar. You can overcome these things of course, but first your husband has to realize that he will need to cooperate with you, not just boss you around. And he will need to start respecting you. Sadly I'm not confident either of these things will happen. 

Go to your husband and tell him you've re-considered his request and you won't be removing your friends from your life. Re your need to grow up and no one has friendships like that - uncalled for and blatantly false. People have friends, close friends, friends that have replaced their family in a lot of cases. Also no matter what other people do, your husband is out of line to suggest you should cease your harmless contact with your friends.

You're being a bit too enabling to his insecurities and unhealthy behaviors, and in that sense you're a bit unreasonable (unrealistic). Otherwise nothing you want seems out of the ordinary."
"I do understand that he is stressed, but we are all stressed to some degree. It's a rare person who has a stress free life so we all have to learn how to handle it appropriately. 

Nobody expects your boyfriend to be perfect, everyone loses their temper from time to time, but I'm really concerned about how your boyfriend spoke to you. Calling someone a dirty slut is a pretty big thing, even if he did apologise afterwards. His behaviour towards the neighbours is way over the line too. 

He does need help, he needs help to deal with his anger and he needs to learn some methods to deal with his stress appropriately. 

The problem is that nearly all of this is going to involve counselling of some sort and if he is opposed to that because he feels it's 'unmanly' I really don't know where you go from here. "
"&gt; Shane is secretly his long-lost little sister and he's super protective? He knows some horrible secret about the dude Shane is dating? 

Specifically the type of update I was mentioning.

If you haven't read it yet, you should go check out the story about the boyfriend who made his girlfriend go to the doctor because she peed too much. ...and then read the update about how he has a fetish for exactly that, and right before he disappeared for a vacation for 3 days, he sent her the porn he watches - and then radio silence. 

I half expect it to be that sort of update, but I'm also aware that **realistically, he's just in love.**

Edit: The update post I was talking about got removed. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50zl7q/update_my_26f_boyfriend_30m_of_11_months_is/

But you can still view the original. The update basically said she went to the doc, he said she was 100% fine and normal, boyfriend freaked out and said get a 2nd opinion.

Then right before going on a little camping trip for a couple days, without his phone, he sends her a ton of links to videos of ""watersports porn"". Specifically girls who are being forced to pee, at doctors offices, etc. All he sent were the links, there was no subject to the e-mail, there was no text in the e-mail. Just his way of saying ""oh, btw, I have a pee fetish, that's why I'm treating you so badly. See you in a few days!"""
"Made me smile,  thanks. "
"I used to be like this... if she's like I was, she it not good at recognizing her real feelings, and hence can't communicate them. If she used to be nicer, and this developed over time, it might be an indicator of built-up resentment in the relationship. Because things aren't the way she wants them, and she either doesn't recognize it or doesn't feel she can tell you about her disappointments, she ends up finding tiny things to nag about. 

My suggestion is ignore all of the little behaviors and try to initiate some bigger conversations, of any kind, to see if you can get at some real things that are bugging her. Does she think the two of you are good roommates? That would open the conversation about the housework. But you could bring up way more. Is she bored in her life? How does working part time work for her? Does she have enough money to do things that she wants to do? What does she want to do? Does she miss you because you are working all the time? How is her social life? How is your social life? Talking like this makes you a team. You won't be able to solve all the problems that get listed out immediately, but at least you will be on the same side."
She should also take these to the police before dumping him. Usually this behavior escalates

This means that when you moved in together, you knew you were moving in with a cat that pees everywhere. I do not think it's fair or wise to suggest getting rid of the cat. Instead, I think you should have a serious discussion about how to solve the problem. Maybe your vet knows a cat behavior specialist you can hire. Maybe you can get yourselves on ""My Cat from Hell."" Whatever the case, it has to be a solution you come up with together. If he suggests re-homing her, then so be it."

"You are the only person who gets to decide how big a deal this is.  I think what you're feeling is completely logical, but I also don't think that even matters, really.  To me what happens next will depend a lot on how your husband reacts--if he's anything but abjectly apologetic, and ready to clean up his mess, I'd be outraged.

So first, I think you are entitled to a complete and sincere apology, with no hedging or excuses and DEFINITELY no blaming you, calling you irrational, or citing your hormones.  Then HE needs to be the one who runs interference with his relatives, and he needs to be crystal clear that this was HIS error in judgment, and he needs to be ready to defend against any pushback--no ""well, now the cat's out of the bag, so. . .""  And he needs to defend you 100% if any of his relatives suggest you are being unreasonable/selfish/cold whatever.

You absolutely should not feel you have to talk about your past history at all if you don't want to, and I think you should make it very, very clear to your husband what your boundaries are for him discussing it with anyone else--and if he fucks up again, there's no excuse. (It may be that you would be okay with, say, his mom knowing but don't want her to bring it up, but don't give him any wiggle room.)

Finally, I may get some flack for this, but it's my opinion you get the deciding vote on all matters related to the **pregnancy**--who to tell, what to post online, how many details about your progress you want to give out, who can be at the hospital, what doctor you see,  what diet/exercise/whatever you do.  (I'm not talking about the **child**--pregnancy is not a 50/50 endeavor.) I think this is pretty much true across the board--the person going through the pregnancy gets a bigger say, but in practice obviously you hope most of this is mutually agreeable.  Your husband already fucked up at his first opportunity to carry out a plan as a team.  He absolutely not only needs to distinctly confirm that he will step back to respect and support your experience and needs over his own right now, but that he will have your back completely at any unwanted interjections/suggestions from his family.

"This is so right! I went to therapy with my abusive ex husband. The therapist looked him in the eye said told him what he was doing was abusive and validated that I had every right to be upset.

Here's the thing, he isn't the person you need him to be, assuming you're not exaggerating, the shit he did is uncaring almost to the point of cruelty(you had to wait for him to finish a video game?). So you need to ask yourself, do you really want to have to try to make him give a shit? Is he great in every other respect? Cause this is a huge issue that won't be easy for him to change, he can change but do you really wanna deal with it? Are you just with him out of routine at this point?

A major thing that people learn from failed relationships is to not take your partner for granted, and he's doing this hardcore. I personally feel the only way to learn to not take someone for granted is to lose someone you care about. I don't think you can have the necessary perspective mid-relationship to make that kind of change, at the very least it would take a Buddha level of awareness to do it. 

Go find someone that actually cares."

If this is true then one thing you could do before giving your answer to the family is get fertility tests for both you and your husband. If your both fertile then that concern is greatly diminished or if either of you have issues then you will know it's a valid concern. 

I'm not in your situation but for what it's worth if I were I would turn it down as there are too many easily-to-happen scenarios that could damage the relationships of everyone involved. Although I wouldn't legally adopt I would offer assistance in taking care of the child to the best of my ability. 

I hope it works out for you and good luck in having your own child!"

&gt; Newsflash folks, someone may want to date you current hook up. When the happens it's a perfectly fine time to have a discussion about your relationship. If you can't handle that, don't date

If they had no talk about exclusivity, OP was completely within his rights to date and fuck someone else. The problem is that he drooled out this tactless pile of shit you might or might not actually call a ""conversation"" and basically just treated the whole interaction like a contract negotiation between six year olds rather than a legitimate human adult relationship.

"I can understand where the in laws are coming from OP, and I'm pretty much a step parent at this point. They aren't unkind to your children, you said they still get nice birthday gifts (although not as extravagant as the bio kids) and pay attention enough to acknowledge achievements of theirs.

Your wife taking her biological children to visit her family for a day/weekend once a month isn't unreasonable at all. Have you considered inviting your in laws to a day trip to your house?

Your wife treats them like her own kids outside of the interactions with her parents. That's what matters.

I think it's unreasonable to expect total equality in this situation, and you have it pretty damn good. If my situation was reversed I'd expect the in laws would ignore their non-bio grandchild completely if I were lucky. And my parents will never treat the kid like they do their own biological grandchildren and I don't expect them to either. They don't have the bond with my step kid, hell I don't. You have a good thing going OP, love your family and try including your wife's family into yours instead of expecting your family to be included in theirs."
No that was an exaggeration. He talked to me and just made empty promises about the future and getting married. 
"Call the fiancé. Explain that you've been dating her for 7 months, you have texts and messages to prove it, and he can even ask her mom about you. Give him the information and let him make his own decision."

My first thought. Something bad happened there. Why else is this place gorgeous and priced to sell and just sitting?!
"No. Just, no.

Look, having your mother live in your house taking care of your child, even if you get her to see the light of day and run the math for an equal exchange of hours of her time vs cost of rent/maintaining the household and come out on an equal equation, is just not going to work. It isn't. She'll override your parenting and cause conflict in your relationship."

So basically, fuck 'em. And congrats on your engagement! "

"You seemed to imply that there are other Filipinos in your workplace. Can you talk to one of them (putting it nicely, of course) about Meena, and try to get them to handle it? Or especially, as /u/NonStandardSteve suggests, suggest that she be paired up with another Filipino?

Assuming Meena has any kind of education, the reading names should *not* be this much of a problem. Filipino uses the exact same alphabet as English. Either she's genuinely illiterate (which I assume would be a legit workplace/employment issue), or is not making the effort to read, or as you mentioned is just not very bright.

Again, my personal tactic would be to talk to another Filipino in the workplace (one that you can communicate well with, so preferably one who's very good at English and/or you have a particularly good working relationship with) about the various problems, starting with the non-language ones (e.g. washing machine/dryer mess-ups), then the ones that are only partially language issues (e.g. the name labels, since they're written and don't involve Meena's accent, just Meena's ability to read the Roman alphabet, which is ^mostly the same in English or in Filipino), and leave the accent/spoken-language issues for last or don't emphasize them as much as the previous issues which are more clear-cut IMO.

(P.S. The gender pronouns are a lost cause, I'm afraid. Your guess is right that Tagalog doesn't have ""he"" vs. ""she"" or ""his"" vs. ""hers."" Highly fluent English speakers still regularly fall into this trap and produce sentences like ""John took off her cast today."")"

I mean, maybe the gp would've told me to take an otc medication first but don't you think it remains my decision to make regardless? "
Yup. This is why it needs to be drawn up by a lawyer too. What is unconscionable is a matter of precedence and most people won't know what the precedence for something being unconscionable is. A lawyer doing up a cohab agreement/prenup should.
"She knew things hadn't been going well and still chose to rip blankets off of him to engage further in the argument once he tried to get to bed. It's not victim blaming to point out what a stupid decision that was with the information she had available, nor is it assuming all drunks are violent.

Hell, I'd be livid if my husband ripped my blankets off me to engage in an argement further even if I were sober."
"You can think I'm overreacting but don't make shit up. I didn't dump my problems on him, I asked him to make me a coffee in the morning *once*. And I have been helping myself - cut caffeine after 4pm, going for a walk in the evening, no screens an hour before bed. I've been researching sleep hygiene and following the advice. This isn't a long-running problem, it's been a few weeks and is probably because we moved house so our bedroom is different and my routine changed. It's not like I've been a cranky asshole living on 3 hours sleep for a year and begging him to help me. 

And even if it was like you imagine it, it'd still be wrong for him to give me medication without my permission or knowledge. Again, tell me I'm overreacting and what I should do now - fine. I'm getting useful viewpoints from people here. But making up a bunch of stuff that isn't true just to have a go at me isn't helpful or kind. "

"Yes, but he's 8. That's what I mean by saying wait until the appropriate age to discuss. I mean, if you really wanted to go all in, you could discuss good touch, bad touch and explain he broke the law in the bad touch way... I completely agree he did something abhorrent. 

However, I can't imagine trying to discuss rape in terms my 8yo son would or should comprehend. You're going for simple, truthful explanations until he's at a more appropriate age, which isn't for a few more years. I'm looking at this from a parents perspective with a son the same age as the child in the OP. I can be wrong, this is just how I would approach it with my son. "

"this is honestly pretty ridiculous. ""work wife"" is a common term these days and it doesn't mean anything sexual/romantic. I think it makes sense for OP to tell her co-worker not to call her that if it bothers her. "

"While you were right to end the situation due to your discomfort, I have a hard time with the idea of people doing things ""for my own good"". If you're uncomfortable - absolutely stop. If you think I'm uncomfortable - talk to me, don't just assume you know how I'm feeling.

Despite that, your husband is reacting frustratingly / not super maturely so I can see why your first thought in the moment wasn't to have a conversation!"

"He lied about the beginning of your relationship. If he cheated on her and waited so long to break up with her for you, that says to me he's the kind of person who is always looking for something better. Chances are he'll do the same thing to you. If it were me, I'd dump him."
"You don't think he cheated on you, but he was still with his ex for the first few months of your relationship? Sounds like he played both of you. "
"I am so scared. I'm scared to be with him and I'm scared to be alone. What you've said is exactly it - he doesn't see me as a person. I don't know why, maybe because I was so young when we met, maybe because of my past, maybe because I am so psychologically messed up that he can't relate to me. Whatever it is, he no longer cares when he sees me hurting. He doesn't feel the need to explain what he's doing seeing other women beyond criticizing me for making him look astray to begin with. He slammed my wrist so hard against a table I was terrified it was broken and he didn't care, no hospital, no going easier on chores, yelled at me for getting things done too slowly and trying to ""make him feel guilty."" It was like he couldn't see that I was a living person in pain, he was just frustrated with the inconvenience of me being hurt. We do things he knows I detest in bed. Why? It doesn't matter, it's what he wants. What I want couldn't matter less. I don't think he knows I feel pain and have desires and hopes and fears as much as he does."
Lots of people have to do that. I did. I'm now in medical school. At least you can make friends. You need to talk to an adult in your life about this.
"hoo boy this thread is a doozy isnt it? My life feels like somewhere between yours and OP's daughter.  my mom loves my goody-two-shoes older brother and couldnt care less abt me. Dad treats us the same-ish. Lots of this thread hits close to home ahaha. 

OP needs to make sure his daughter knows that hes not okay with how moms treating her. 'dad doesnt care enough to interfere'  *IS* a thought that i guarantee *she has already had*,  that only *maybe* can be fixed. 

TBH i doubt mom and daughter can salvage this relationship. Not unless Mom changes tune 100% and makes it clear that she loves her. Not just the words, either, but actually *show* it. Something tells me thats not likely to happen soon. 

In my case my brother sees how bad our mom treats me and we stand up for each other, but if OP's daughter doesnt have that, then shes probably not in a good place. She needs people to show her that shes not making shit up and her mom isnt behaving like a parent should. OP should at the very least encourage her to spend time with her friends who support her, so she doesnt feel isolated. Ideally he should stand up for her and make her feel loved himself.

"This definitely isn't the popular opinion, but...

It's not necessarily wrong to love two people... The only problem is if he doesn't love ""Bestfriend"" and is only with her to be close to OP. 

Unreciprocated love is always awkward, and the situation does suck. But, I think it's important not to think that by him loving someone else, he can't love her. 

I've seen endless negativity towards Guy, but he may just be in a really hard position. He made some bad choices, and did some manipulative things, but nothing so ridiculous as to suggest he is a bad person. In fact, for three years he's been known to be a generally good person. We all make mistakes.

I don't know Guy, but, if OP thinks he actually loves Bestfriend, then she shouldn't tell."

"My wife has done this with some of my stuff, and at first I was upset. But I've come to recognize that I have some hoarder tendencies, and I really do like a clean, open space to live in. Much more than my videotapes from 1988. 

Reflect on your attachment to these things. Is it really more important than the woman you promised to have and to hold, til death do you part? A clean space makes her happy. Work with her on this.

I've found that getting rid of my junk is a process. Every time I go through it with her, I can let go of about half of it. Slowly but surely we've reduced our possessions and created space and happiness in our lives. Take your time, do it together and show her how much she means to you."
"I really think it is her prerogative to decide not to help you this time. 

Your mistakes are your own and you need to take responsibility for them, part of that is to respect your cousin's stance. She does not owe you anything. 

I think you are somehow transferring the blame of the mess that you are in on her and yet you are the one who made all the decisions that put you here.

I also think that it is unfair that you are labeling her as unreasonable to the rest of the family. Her heart was really all out for you the first time, but you sort of broke it. She was fair to you and honest, now she is just following through with her word. "
"Yes, don't underestimate what /u/redwineandspindles has said about having complementary personalities. My boyfriend and I of four years are both pursuing master's degrees currently (him in classical music and me in engineering, so very different), but we are both very ambitious and type A personalities. And we clash All. The. Time. We love each other like mad but because both of us feel the need to control, plan, and analyze a lot of aspects of our lives big and small that more easy going people don't, we clash a lot and have subsequent fights. And they can last a long time because we both articulate and analyze our points before we even begin to start coming to a consensus. It can be draining sometimes but we love each other a lot and are huge supports to each other as well as having a lot of other complementary personality traits, so it works. If you're looking for someone with a really similar outlook on career and ambition as you, beware of the type of relationship that could potentially come with it and see if that's what you want out of that relationship. I myself grappled with this for a while and ultimately came to the conclusion that I would rather be with someone I butt heads with but have similar outlooks on life. It all depends on where your priorities lie with your relationship and it sounds like you don't quite know yet. You don't want to have kids, so there's biological clock ticking to rush you to this conclusion. You seem to be happy with everything in the relationship besides her ambition. If its a big enough personality different to break up over, its totally fine. Just know that you may never be as happy with the other parts of your relationship if you find someone more ambitious because super ambitious people (as a generality, not all obviously) tend to not be really easy going and have the time or effort to support you as much as you need because they have their own big ambitions to worry about and attend to. Best of luck!"

"Something doesnt cease being violent abuse because there is much worse violent abuse in close proximity.

Throwing things is ABSOLUTELY violent abuse, and in this case its particularly concerning because it escalated a purely verbal argument into a physical one.  None of this excuses HIS actions, which mark him as a disgusting asshole who needs to be in prison, but to imply OP doesnt need to address her own behaviour is ridiculous. "
"**save the text, email, and voice mail** back them up. Print them out. Forward them to your lawyer. Get a lawyer *now*. Start the divorce proceedings *now*. 

Your husband is a piece of shit who deserves nothing, be ruthless. He made those children with you, he made the choice to have them then said he didn't want to be a dad. Having a kids is hard, but after knowing them for years it takes a special kind of asshole to nope out like that. Keep the everything, get as much evidence as possible. Do not reply to her at all, not even ""thanks for telling me"". Don't talk to him anymore, don't argue, don't say anything. Anything you say can be used as fire to fuck you. 

Go straight to a lawyer and get everything in place. Start the proceedings. If you want to ask him one thing, ask him if he wants to sign over his rights to the kids. If not, go for child support. 

The nerve of him to bring another woman around your child. "

"What's really striking though is that he carried this on when Alan was no longer there. 

I mean, it would be one thing for him to ask Alan, get rejected, claim it was a joke, and then go home with OP and say ""damn, my plan didn't work, sorry I threw you under the bus there"" but instead he's actually chosen to try and re-write history to OP."
"There's nothing for your boyfriend to press charges for, so I'm not sure why that would factor into your reasoning. You can't press charges against someone for telling someone else she thinks a person committed a crime. There's no crime there.

Look, here is what strikes me as odd about this. Ava is NOT the person who was allegedly assaulted, and yet she is taking it upon herself to track people for YEARS and reach out into their lives to people she DOES NOT KNOW about an event she DID NOT WITNESS and has no first hand knowledge about. She is not deferring to the wishes of her friend even in Ava's version of events. To me, this makes Ava an untrustworthy source who seems to enjoy stirring up trouble and perhaps likes the attention. Or maybe she is the type of person who wants to be a vigilante for a particular cause, in this case college campus sexual assault. Sometimes well intentioned people can see issues where there aren't any when they are overly passionate about something.

Frankly I think that groups of boys can make incredibly stupid and predatory choices when drugs and alcohol are involved. So can girls. At the end of the day, the actual alleged victim here said she didn't even remember what happened and she also said she was around NUMEROUS men that night, not just Cam. There is no first-party physical or testimonial evidence to suggest that Cam roofied and raped this girl. She came home upset and unable to remember things and then Ava suggested she had been roofied. There's just nothing there. Its also hard for me to believe that Ava would know about any civil monetary settlement, as there certainly would have been a non-disclosure agreement, so part of me wonders if that is speculation on Ava's part.

Now the bigger issue is how to handle this in the context of your relationship. He owes you a serious and detailed conversation about this, but then you just need to choose whether you believe him or not. Just know that he is likely going to take offense if you take the word of a stranger (who again is NOT even the alleged victim) over your partner of several years, and he very well may leave you over that.


ETA something I put in another comment that I think sums it up: If a guy came onto R/relationships and said ""in college I hooked up twice with this girl and then never texted her. apparently she felt really guilty about having sex because she was religious. I guess one day she came back crying after we'd had drunk sex and a friend of hers convinced her I must have taken advantage of her. The friend used to spread nasty rumors about me on campus, saying I take advantage of girls. The police even got involved, it was scary and humiliating but they confirmed there was no evidence at all. I basically just put it behind me and moved on. Now, five years later, the friend is messaging my SO and telling her I did all these horrible things I never did. Its insane. How can I get this crazy person to leave me alone???"" Seems really different from that perspective."
Years of this?  Y'all need to fix your fundamental lack of communication. Some marriage counseling is highly recommended for starters.

But you're already almost 30.  No one is going to look much better after this.  

Stretch marks are simply nature's scars.  Heck, even if she had burn scars, it's still totally acceptable.

I think you should really consider that this has been thrown upon you and expectations are very quick.  I doubt that your loss of erection had as much to do with her appearance than it does with all the other things that weigh into this.

I'm not of your culture, so correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't every arranged dating/marriage have high hopes of getting an attractive person?

What are the chances of that?

IMO, you won the lottery that you connect on a much better level than physical attraction.

Because the truth is, no one is going to get any ""hotter"" at this point.

"Let's get real. You've been in Egypt for less than 3 months. You haven't even seen what working in the Middle East is like, and you're saying you'll tutor in a war-torn country with a man you knew for less than quarter of a year. The effects of your decision will not likely be reversed so quickly.

To answer your question, there is no easy way to break it to them. You just have to be honest and say ""Mom, Dad, I'm thinking of going to Benghazi"". You are not an asshole, its your life to live the way you want. But consider a friend telling you the same story you told us. Would you encourage her to travel?"
"Okay, it's gotten to the point where you're expressing interest in opinions that only fit your wants, not what the majority agrees on. As a young-person, I know this song and it would be the first thing I thought of when I hear the name. Younger children who I babysit know this song.

What ISNT healthy is your reluctance to see the opinions and suggestions of others as valid because they don't agree with your desired outcome.

This isn't about what you want, this isn't about what your wife wants, this is what is best for your unborn daughter. This is the name she is going to have for the REST of her life. This is the name your wife is going to be calling her daughter till the day your wife no longer walks this earth. If the association bothers your wife, finding a compromise that works for both of you is the best fit. Compromise works on both ends, and yes, in this situation it would mean giving up the name, but that's how life works sometimes. Why not use it as a middle name? Or call her Anne? Or even just Roxie?"

"It means for abortion because if he doesn't end up compromising I will not want to carry his child anymore. It's a horrible ultimatum, but why should I be the one giving up on my culture and not him? You are right that it's a huge obstacle but from my point of view it's just so ... simple, all he has to do is not mutilate a child and pick a somewhat common name. As I said, he is not religious, he just has to get away from his parents pressure, which is of course much harder than it sounds in this particular culture."

"Here's your $120 and the money for the snacks.  You need to get a hotel tonight and I need my car for the rest of the week so you should get a rental.

Or, salt the earth: present her with a bill for her stay.  Deduct the $120 and snacks from half the cost of the meal, gas, entrance fee, and hotel cost she saves by staying with you (with a 10% family discount).  Add a caveat that she can only stay in the future when that bill is paid in full.  You might also refuse to pay the $120 unless she proves that you agreed to enter that contract.  Show me the text.  Tell me when I said yes.

Or really keep the peace: Pay the $120 and suck it up for this vacation, but separate all finances and never let her stay with you again.  Let her know that you feel taken advantage of (by not getting upgrades or compensation and stuck in a contract without your consent) and you will not allow that to continue."

"The military life is a bit out of the norm. There are frequent get togethers in attempts to keep moral up, so you can only expect more of them. Because your spouse is fairly new to this lifestyle, it is possible he wants someone just as new to it (you) to experience it with. It may be coming off as clingy, but you should look at it as a positive, that he can rely on you to give him piece of mind; bring him comfort in a new setting. Have you told him how you feel? It is possible that you can tell him after going to an event or a particular coworker's get together once or twice, that you aren't comfortable going again.  It could also be that he simply wants you to meet more people. He could vary well not enjoy 100% of the company but feel as though he has a role to play and he would like you to fit into a role as well. For some spouses, it is enjoyed to  be ""the wife"" and go to spouses events, or picnics, etc. but for others it is furthest away from what they want. Ultimately, you'll both have to find a balance of time ""out of the office"". I think it is completely acceptable to not attend every event your husband invites you to, but it may also raise some flags if you never attend any, at least from his higher command. As your husband continues to gain rank, the spouse is often expected join the military member at event, buuuut that isn't for a while so no worries with that. "
"Another idea that won't save you right now but can get you out of there two years ahead of schedule: early college. Google early college and look at Simon's Rock especially. There are a few schools which exist for teenagers who are unhappy and who are ready to leave high school 1-2 years early and go straight to college. You would need them to write an essay for you, though; there has to be a parental essay. And you need to be good at school.

"OP said it wasn't just a DVD. It was multiple items totalling hundreds of dollars. He initially discovered it because a DVD was missing, and it escalated to her eventual admission.

"She has taken personal responsibility for her actions in the past, but as much as she's done that, I am reminded that I basically had to hide from her from the ages of 5 to 16. I couldn't have friends over; I couldn't be in public in the vicinity of her and her friends. There's a part of me that could easily hate her for life. We'll never be close, that I know. I feel like if I meet her in a public place, it's just an invitation for me to sit there and stew, not saying anything because I hate big public displays of emotion. 

My other sisters are 7 and 9 years older than I am, so during the era of abuse and torment, they weren't really around. My oldest sister left for college when I was 9 and the other sister left when I was 11. I think they feel guilt about the fact that when they were around, they believed my sister and would exclude me from things. When my sister admitted everything, it came crashing down that during summers and Christmas they would do things that specifically excluded me. My oldest sister invited me to her wedding (even asked me to be a ""bride's man"" and has sent an invite to every birthday, christmas party and event for the last couple of years; but, I've rebuffed her. She has children &amp; a husband and wants me to get to know them, but part of me thinks that we're veritable strangers, so what does it matter?

I could see myself getting to know my other sisters, but I just finished school and am starting to work. I don't have a lot of money, and with a baby, there's a lot of stress. The stress of having to get to know my other sisters just isn't what I want to be doing right now. As for Lisa, I'd eventually like to tell her what a rotten person she was, but she knows it. It kind of takes all the fun out of it. I just don't have the strength right now. "

I will not see them again, until such time as I'm ready and reach out.  I cannot stop you from contacting them or vice versa, but that will not help us in our relationship; I'm 100% firm on this and in no way discussing my decision to defend myself from both past and possible future injury.  I'm hoping you'll help me.""

"I disagree with the horse trading approach to compromise in this situation (one person ""gets"" naming rights over a slot in the name in trade for naming rights over another slot). Honestly, I think parents always have veto power over a name, and you shouldn't name a child over the objection of either one.

Having said that, I disagree with other posters and think your ""accounting"" is off. He's not ""getting"" the last name: it's just his last name, which you both agree, without conflict, is what you want. Set it aside; it's a given.

In most of the English-speaking world, the middle name is essentially a non-entity unless the child chooses to make a statement later by using it.

I believe that leaves you with the obligation to compromise on what the first name will be. There are many problem-solving, consensus-building, negotiation and decision-making techniques you can use here, and I suggest you develop some because this is one of the easier things you will have conflicts about as co-parents. For example, try taking the other side and practice insisting on an Irish name: pick you favorite ten, and your husband picks his favorite ten Indian names and argues as hard as he can for them. Table the discussions when you can't agree."

Basically it takes on the feeling of a business transaction instead of a romantic one and while in this situation your concerns make sense no one likes to feel judged like that.

Well, I did.

&gt; telling him that she likes her alone time, are not remotely the same as directly saying to a guy ""I am not interested in being friends with you."".

Certainly telling someone you *need your alone time*, so please leave me alone, is telling someone to leave you alone. Assuming English words have meaning to you, I guess. She's absolutely made herself clear, here, there's no ambiguity about what she wants him to do at this point. He just doesn't *care* about what she wants enough to listen.

&gt; Ideally sure, but in reality if a female student goes crying to the dean saying that she's being stalked, then he could easily end up with an arrest record at the very least.

An arrest record from the dean? How do you think that works, exactly? The reason to go to the dean is that the *dean* will talk to him. That's where it starts, *talking.* It's abundantly obvious that she's too scared to tell him to fuck off, because she's frightened by how he'll react. And good fucking reason! This guy walks right through her boundaries like they're not even there.

Well, this *is* the dean of students' role - mediating problems between students. OP has a problem with another student, and therefore she absolutely should avail herself of the options her school has set up *precisely* for this purpose.

&gt; Please, tell me, why do you think that OP shouldn't talk to this guy first?

Because she already did, and he treated her boundaries like something he doesn't even have to pretend to take seriously. Therefore the next step is to avail herself of someone who can affirm those boundaries on her behalf - the dean of students, whose job this is to do for her."

"The problem is that you put on a ""stand up comedy routine"" in front of someone who signs your girlfriend's paychecks. Every normal person knows not to do this.

You also say that your friends dislike her for not having dinner with them. Why should she have dinner with people who dislike her? This seems like you're treating this poor girl terribly for what could be social anxiety or just a preference.

That you have friends who gossip about how they dislike someone for not drinking coffee is really embarassing for you. I would see that as horribly immature and I'm 5 years younger than you."
"I create written transcripts for companies when they do their quarterly earnings calls, present at conferences, things like that.

Sometimes we do foreign calls as well that are interpreted into English.  I have serious mad respect for those interpreters.  Not only are they having to translate from another language into English (which might not even be their first or second language) on the fly, but they have to process what they're listening to in order to translate it, and some of these calls get seriously termy or jargony."
"His reluctance to commit to marrying someone with whom he has six hour arguments, a four month breakup, and with whom he has only lived together for a year seems perfectly reasonable to me.

You say ""We get along the majority of the time."" That doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement of the relationship.

Your desire to marry a man who you think doesn't love you and with whom you have regular arguments lasting up to six hours seems rooted in wanting financial security and wanting to live in the US, and that's not a great basis for a healthy marriage.

"Be honest: are you giving 19F money or buying her stuff?

"You literally said ""don't forget, this is important"". Not sure how much clearer you can be. And it sounds like even the day of when you explained how you were feeling, he still brushed you off. It seems like he understands, he just doesn't seem to care."

"He didn't say, ""your fiance is The Tits.""  He said, ""does the tits like Chinese food?""  There's a difference.  The first one is ""your fiance is awesome.""  The second is him calling her after her body parts.    "
"He lied to you for weeks about his plans to do something with it,  never did.  You told him straight up get it out or its gone,  he didn't,  it's gone.   Yet you're untrustworthy.   OK"
"Tell him its also unmanly to call your wife names, especially unprovoked."
"Agreed, he sounds really controlling.

Like, I actually would not want to date his gf either and would not date a pothead (not for condescending 'moral' issues but because I'm just not into it and would find it unattractive). But neither would I date someone knowing they did a lot of pot, try to control or change them, blow up at them when they smoke pot on their own time and I happen to call (how is she supposed to predict he'd call her?! how is she supposed to be at his beck and call 24/7??) and so aggressively force her into having a conversation while she's at work. Maybe she was trying to avoid you, OP, because you're intimidating and aggressive, and maybe she was impassive because she didn't want to give you the satisfaction of breaking down. Good riddance - on her behalf."
"The only possible explanation besides that he has a thing for Shane is that when you were talking about her new boyfriend, you talked about him more favorably than you talk about your own boyfriend. Maybe you mentioned how good-looking and/or fit he is, and your boyfriend is super insecure?"

"No offence to op, but a fit conventionally attractive 25 year old women probably wouldn't be posting this."
"I am generally a big fan of this approach because it either highlights how blindly the other person is just seeking ""one big happy family"", or it forces them to stop and think about why they really want that."

"Imagine how uncomfortable she feels to have had a breakdown in front of people who would never have otherwise had to see exactly where her illness takes her.

And it really does come across like you don't like her or are going to choose not to be her friend because it's easier than having to empathise with someone you don't understand."
"Yeah but the comment you're replying to is talking about what will happen if they don't divorce and OP's husband keeps pulling stuff like this. 

Also, as a general point it's worth remembering that stuff very young kids don't remember can have an effect on things like how they regulate emotion as adults."
Can I ask you if you are from a racial minority and did you have a racist roommate?
"Quite slim, sure. Do I suspect that the average human might cheat? Yeah sure. Do I suspect that the average human might commit arson? No.... That's way into crazy town and I would also be wondering why I am assuming my bf set his house on fire, when his brother and best friend are inside, instead of facing a breakup."
I love reading all of these and seeing how for once when everyone jumped to conclusions there was an actual emergency...
"I'm sorry for him, but this is hilarious."
Thanks for the advice. I'll do that and see if I can't get an estimate of how much it would cost and bill them for those. Won't be the same but at least I'll feel a bit better.
"OP already said that she was expecting 60/40, the BF was only leaving her 20% of the food.

"Red a-fucking-lert. These are textbook controlling behaviors. The kiss of death being that he refuses to hear or discuss your concerns. If this is the life you want to live (and worse, it'll definitely get worse), by all means continue. But if I were you I would've been out the door ages ago. 

Wonder why his first marriage ended?"
"If you take your father in, you might as well break up with your boyfriend, because that is the inevitable outcome. 

Alcoholism is a disease which destroys not only the alcoholic, but all those around them. 

You cannot pull your father up, but he can pull you down. 

He has to decide that he wants treatment. You cannot control his alcoholism. You cannot save him, or any other person for that matter, from himself. 

You can look around for rehab situations. You can try to hook him up with a doctor who can prescrib Antabuse. You can investigate what social services are available.  

Your father had a long path, spanning decades, to get to this point. They say that an alcoholic has to hit rock bottom but for some people, sadly, no bottom is rock bottom enough for then to get them to change. 

I suggest that you look for some Al-Anon and ACOA meetings for yourself. 

Edit: I realize that it's one thing to tell you not to let him in, and quite another to cope with that conversation. Here are some things for you to write down and have in front of you when talking to him: 

-- It is against the terms of your lease to have anyone stay over (check your lease; I can almost guarantee there is a clause about overnight guests, or guests staying mire than a couple of nights). 

-- You are not a rehab. You are completely incapable of helping him stop drinking. 

-- It doesn't matter how many promises he makes about not drinking; if he could have controlled it on his own, he wouldn't have lost his job. 

-- You are willing to help him find social services, including rehab and disability. 

Here's what you actually say. Do not JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, or Explain). Alcoholics are experts in kying, justifying, and manipulating. So don't give him anything to hold onto. Do not discuss offering your house unless he point blank asks. If he hints or implies, ignore it. 

If he directly asks, tell him that would be impossible. Do not say anything more than that. If he asks why, say, ""That won't be possible and it's not up for discussion."" 

If he badgers, manipulates, guilt trips, or gets mean, hang up or walk away. 

If he acts sad or pitiful, offer to help him arrange social services, rehab, go to the doctor with him, etc. 

That's about it. Don't allow the conversation to get long, don't allow him to abuse or harangue you over the phone, and don't allow him to get wallowy. 

If he is willing to take some specific, positive step with you, such as meet you at a social services agency at 9:30 am Monday morning, or let you take him to the doctor's, arrange that. Otherwise, end the call. The longer you are on the line, the more likely you will be to feel guilty and promise something that is a bad idea. 

"
"Wow, that sounds really awkward for her though. She would probably prefer to avoid you, and your parents are sending you into her house? How old is she? Is she really ok with this arrangement or is she just agreeing because your parents are her clients?"
I don't think I'll enjoy it if I'm just forcing him to do stuff though. 
"I'm not crying, you're crying!"
"A child, especially an only child, being the entire reason for living, and complete center of their parent's universe is just as damaging in some cases. 

One of my 'mommy timeouts' is an evening of not cooking. We sometimes do fend-for-yourself-Friday. There's plenty of leftovers in the fridge, ingredients for a sandwich, cereal and canned soup in the pantry. If they really want to go all out, they can make a pizza. 
And you know what? They love it. I get to be lazy and just read my book, while they learn some independence skills and make their own meal. They even get to decide whether they eat at 5, or 6, or 7. It's all up to them. My input is only there to not let them burn the house down while experimenting and making eggs. Plus later in life I can go out for the day without a 17 year old calling and crying when mommy will be back to feed him like my neighbor....here's looking at you, Kelly! "
"Do me a favor and Google ""women killed for refusing dates"" since we can't link in this sub. Then in the future, maybe accept that a woman who is afraid has been socially trained to placate the man she is afraid of and that she knows that telling him to leave her alone could cause him to escalate. In an ideal world she could tell him and he would take her 'no', but if she is too afraid to do so, she should involve someone else so that he does receive the message."
"&gt; No matter what medical condition you have you can overcome it

You are detached from reality.  

There is a big difference between ""her fault"" and ""nothing she can do about it"" and you seem to be conflating them.  There is plenty she can do about it.  That doesn't make it her fault.  "

"I would let her have the larger room, and try to keep things civil while you quickly and quietly secure a new apartment and someone to sublet the smaller room for you. Find your new apartment first, then tell her you're leaving and you'll be happy to find someone to sublet.

The thing is, this relationship is already doomed before it's started. She's going back on her word, ignoring you, letting you do everything, and has proven herself to be completely unreliable and untrustworthy. If you take the larger room, I'd be worried she'd intentionally make your life hell. Messing with your things, damaging the apartment and claiming you did it, being an all around terrible roommate, etc. Believe me, you don't want to try to ""win"", because you won't. You don't know this person or what she'd be willing to do if she feels like you screwed her over. 

You'll be better off being the mature, reasonable adult, and getting out of a bad situation."

"He knows she doesn't love him. She shows a difference in how she treats. This poor little boy knows he is not wanted by his own mother. Children sense these things. They are smarter than adults definitely in this situation. This little boy didn't ask to be born you gave him life you are suppose to love and protect him, which you have failed. You should be ashamed of to call yourself a mother. You need help and you need to get your son help if you can't love him like your daughters and your husband can't accept him you need to leave and give your son a chance for a loving home environment."

"For what it's worth, I work at a Fortune 100 company and people coming straight out of MBA school start at around $50,000 depending on what department and skills they have. It will be a long time until your gf is making six figures.

You're allowed to be annoyed with him, but really, just let it go.  You don't need the drama right now."
Thank you. That's a nice way to look at it
"They say that if you want to know how a guy will treat you, look at how he treats his mom and sisters.

"Agreed.

Discussing marriage and life events and things like that are normal. 

When it comes time to the actual proposal, I feel like there shouldn't be any hesitation on anyone's part. 

She should know by now. I can understand if they had been dating for just a few months, and she was hesitant, but 5 years and multiple proposals? She doesn't want to marry OP, but she doesn't have the heart to break up with him either because she does care about him. 

OP. Time to tearfully break up with this girl. It'll suck and it will hurt. We've all been there, though. You'll find someone who you love more than you realized you could love, and she'll love you the same. "

"Honestly, just give them the money if its charity. We did the opposite; hired family to help. It was a nightmare and no easy way to break the ties. Almost cost us our 2nd largest contract because of her horrid behavior, not to mention family was even more pissed when we had to ""fire"" her. So, relationship not saved, money lost, it would have been better if we had stood our ground and said we werent hiring. Never again. Sad too, we just wanted to help."

I don't control my friends' lives. I don't ""let"" them do anything. I can express my opinions but if they continue making terrible decisions (even if for understandable reasons) and that stresses me out, the only thing left for me to do is remove myself from the situation because *I can not control other people*. Yes, that means I ""let them make mistakes."" Sometimes those mistakes are really, really shitty and involve abusive relationships.

"&gt;That is not the worst thing guys say about their significant others behind closed doors. The way guys talk, if their wives/girlfriends could hear them, would get them ALL dumped.

"&gt;I thought it was fairly decent considering the circumstances surrounding our relationship. We barely ever see each other, and she is the most insecure person I've ever met when it comes to herself and physical connection

Well, this is off to a great start.

&gt;We've had sex once since we started dating (for multiple reasons) and when I start coming on to her trying to get intimate, she doesn't respond because she feels ""obligated"" every time I see her (which is very sparse at best) and feels really bad. 

Oh boy

&gt;The solution we came to (the only one we could come to with our situation) is for us to move in together soon, and I'm simply not okay with that because I don't think I could support that financially or emotionally. I feel like I'm being rushed into something I'm not ready for, and I'm just ready for something to go right. 

Ok you know what, I'm not going to keep quoting your post, because it's unnecessary.

Abandon ship. This isn't working. Moving in is *not* going to magically solve your problems. You're too young to be having these kinds of issues, and you're too young to be moving in together like this.

Your gut is right that you should leave her. So do that."

"I live in Canada's most expensive city, in an area that is known for wealth and opulence (and I am poor, sadly). Once I change jobs, I'll get benefits, but I really haven't had great therapy experiences. It isn't one gender or the other, I just find all of them lack a certain empathy when dealing with guys. I even asked one once what she'd say if I were a female client and she just stammered for a second, said ""I guess, you're..."" And changed the subject. "
"His wife was absolutely and completely wrong. He made himself abundantly clear that he did not want this.  He went as far as to send a cease and desist letter.  He made his boundaries crystal clear.  Though it may have been from a good place and she thought she was helping, she chose to ignore all of those things in favor of serving what the rest of the family was asking for.  She disregarded his needs for others.

She should feel guilty because she made a huge misstep.  It's damaging to his trust and shows she is willing to place others above him.  "
"It's rude of her to ask, and even ruder and weirder to be so insistent about this. I would simply say no and be firm about it.

As an aside, it surprises me that she would even *want* someone else aside from her spouse to take such a young kid on such a long and probably logistically complex trip without her being there. Coincidentally, I was discussing almost the exact opposite issue regarding my own daughter (we also live in NC, and in this case, the issue is a family member asking if they can take our daughter to Disney World at some point). And personally there is no way I'd want that to happen until she's at an age when she can pretty much almost be responsible for herself on a trip like that. Whether you fly or drive, going from NC to Orlando with a young child and then spending a bunch of time there is a huge hassle filled with a lot of potential issues. It's not like coming over and taking them out to the playground for an hour."
I'm so curious as to how much he paid you.
"&gt;I am concerned about the effect a divorce could have on my child. 

- Your son will not grow up thinking it's ok to scream at mommy.

- Your son will not grow up thinking it's OK to control, belittle, demean and harass mommy.

- Your son will not grow up thinking it's OK to cheat on mommy - SO OK that dad brings him along when he does it. 

- Your son will not grow up thinking emotional abuse is normal. 

He's only playing now because there's real consequences for his behavior. Make no mistake, this wasn't about cheating - he was trying to punish you. He wanted you to know, wanted you to feel worthless, like he ""settled"" and that other women were on stand-by to make up for your deficiencies if you stepped a toe out of line. He was and IS incredibly controlling and a month of therapy hasn't fixed that. 

&gt;he seems genuinely appalled by his behavior.

Or appalled that it didn't work. 

You're doing the right ing by divorcing him, OP. It's normal to miss the good side, and romanticize the person you thought he was. But he isn't that guy. He's the guy who took your son along while he titty fucked a woman he's at the very least ALREADY been having an emotional affair with, and then rubbed it in your face in the most hurtful way possible. People who love, support and respect you don't do this to you. "
You are absolutely correct
"You've been down this road before with an abusive boyfriend. How far do you want to follow it this time? 

This man already strangled you. That's a major risk factor for being murdered by your SO. He's both physically and verbally/emotionally abusive. Your own behavior is problematic, since you threw a bottle in anger (though that in no way made you deserve his abuse). You may want this relationship to work, but it won't, and you're in danger while you stay.

Get away from him. Today. Now. Get yourself safe, and get any trustworthy family and friends lined up to help you. Once you're safe and the initial dust has settled, then get yourself set up with a therapist. That way you can work on your ability to recognize, set, and enforce appropriate relationship boundaries, as well as how to deal with anger appropriately."

"My guess is that you suck at putting on condoms. You're probably not pinching the tip. Watch some YouTube videos about it. When I was younger and less used to putting on condoms I experienced a lot more breakages -- now it's been years since my last one. 

If you're hung and using normal sized condoms, that could also be an issue. Also, if you used oil-based lube, that would have dissolved the latex and caused breakage. Use something water-based. 

If you're still anxious, pull out in addition to using condoms. Pulling out is nearly as effective as condoms when done correctly, so the combo should keep you very well covered. And if all else fails, the morning after pill exists. "

" That's how this works. Abuse usually starts out slowly, as the abuser pushes more and more of our boundaries. If you don't notice at first, it means that he's good at what he's doing. It's like a frog in boiling water-- if you put a frog in boiling water, it'll jump out, but if you put it in cold water and slowly turn up the temperature, it will never move. That is how abuse works."
