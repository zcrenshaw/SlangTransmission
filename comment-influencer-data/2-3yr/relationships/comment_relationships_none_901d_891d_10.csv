"His anger about watching a loved one hurt himself for years might be valid, but I don't think there's really a way to justify directing it at OP. He should be venting to a friend outside the situation, not his wife. "
"This subreddit is for asking questions about relationships. Not venting. It even says ""make sure that it's a question"" in the sidebar."
"I am so sorry. You will need to end this relationship. He did something creepy. If it were an accident, he would have told you immediately (source- my husband went to my sister's house to drop something off, and saw her walking through the kitchen topless- she was running to get clothes while he was pulling up her driveway. He called me from the car, too upset to go into the house. Sister and I laughed because he's a nice man, apologies were made, he tries to bleach the image from his mind, all is well).

So now, even if you forgave him- which you shouldn't since you know only because someone else told you and he would have kept doing it if he didn't get caught- he's still someone who was super creepy to your sister and was looking at her sexually, and is therefore not someone you want around. 

You're not a bad person for missing him at all. You miss the person you thought he was. You loved that person. And now they're gone and that is very sad and worth mourning. "
"&gt; A month ago she stopped taking her pill

A pill for what and why did she stop taking it?"
"It depends where you are and what field you're in.

My ex-bf went from beginning his PhD to getting a fellowship in like 6 years. 

But I'm telling you now... Academia doesn't pay well. Even when you're tenured, the equivalent skill-level and effort could earn you multiple times elsewhere in a non-uni career.

You may have to move around a lot to fulfill post-docs, not to mention the research, conferences, meetings, pure stress of writing and maybe even teaching.

I'm not trying to put you off. Honestly. My current bf is 2 years into his PhD and he works insanely hard, he also travels a LOT (less than he used to). But he's also worked a lot and got loads of experience. And even then - tenure is never certain."

"Wow, your post has a lot of great advice, especially the marking off the calendar and talking to my teachers seems like the best option at this point. I'll start taking things one step at a time, before finally talking about it with my mom. ""Focus on what you can change"" is definitely something I'll try to think about more. Thank you for the insight! :) "

"You do realize they're real people, not pets, right?"
"Yeah! I kissed the girl I'm dating near the end of our second date. On our first date, I wasn' sure if the interest was reciprocal. Women often feel more vulnerable and uncomfortable in a date, so I worried about not invading her personal space, or unintentionally making her uncomfortable.

But at our second date, from the conversations we were having during the week, I felt much safer, and I was pretty sure that the interest was mutual. And during the date I was 100% sure, and that's when we kissed. Sometimes, for the sake of respect, someone may not take action without being sure that it is what the other person wants.

I would say that by the way of things are going, the kiss will happen soon! Do not worry too much, OP, and enjoy!"
Sounds like he did his best to ruin her holiday. I'd be pissed off too.
"As someone who often makes serious social errors with no ill will, this makes me sad. We're obviously very different people so I feel compelled to ask, out of curiosity: why do you have so little empathy for an annoying but obviously very lonely person?"
"Dear God I hope not, since its very likely that our children will reach 6' and over..."

"So I think I've identified how things can get better.

- Stop focusing so much on race, it's unatractive. 
- Stop being a fucking judgemental asshat too. That may be the main problem actually. "
"Congratulations, you just got played and used like a doormat. Angie is not going to leave without a fight, now. It is not your responsibility to take care of a 30 year old who cannot care for herself. You need to stand up for yourself, she is 10000% taking advantage of you. 

If she knows anything about tenancy rights, she'll know you now have to formally evict her through the courts. Welcome to growing up. "
"Smarter people than you and I have fallen for worse scams. You have nothing to be embarrassed about. He’s the one who should be ashamed. Just keep your head up and go about your business. 

Also, there’s some sketchy advice going on in this thread. If he does have compromising videos/pictures of you then ask him to delete it. Not a lawyer and don’t know the legality surrounding this, but it’s probably not a good idea to take his property and delete it yourself. However, you should go to the police if he threatens to release them. "
"Maybe you're leaving some details out, but I feel like your husband is overreacting. 

It's not like you committed to anything. All you have to do is see the place, and you don't even really need to do that. No decisions have been made without him. If my girlfriend did that, I'd probably just be like ""cool, I dunno if it'll work out given what we've previously discussed, but I'm happy to see it!""

Is there something else bothering him? It just seems like something too small to get that upset over. "
I cannot stand passive aggressive.  You come off as insufferable in this story.
"There's probably quite a bit being said in the statement he made. He's probably frustrated that he has to pay for everything and will have to for the foreseeable future. Just because you don't have a degree doesn't mean you can't make a good living for yourself. I make 170K without one, so it's certainly possible, but you seem like you're okay earning a low wage forever. You can still move up in fast-food and retail establishments, have you? At face value, he was asking you a straight-forward question. I'm curious as to whether or not you live with your parents still? "
"""Nutritionist"" isn't, but ""dietician"" is -- and a lot of people don't know the difference, which makes things hairier. "
"Don't keep seeing him romantically - whatever the truth of his situation this isn't ""separated and getting divorced soon"" which would be a whole other thing. He's still living with his wife and going on family vacations! How do you see this working out in the medium term? He's not separated, he's just in a loveless marriage, which is *not* the same thing. 

So step one would be him telling his wife he's seeing someone. If he's not willing to do that then essentially he's cheating on her with you, and a divorce lawyer will have a field day. No matter the connection between you, you can't have a real relationship with this guy while he's in this situation. And that sucks for you both, assuming he's not just stringing you along as a woman on the side, but it's the way it is. He either needs to accept that his marriage is over and move on, or commit to working things out, because if he thinks that this half-assed option is in any way healthy for the kids he's a fool."
Well you got the answer you wanted.  Threads over guys lets go home
"Dude, don't ask these questions on r/relationships. Every time someone does the comments become a jumble of random correct and incorrect facts about STI testing and incubation times and symptoms. Find a reputable website which explains these things, or ask in a more health related sub. I'm not bagging you out for asking, just saying that the answers you get here are usually not that accurate. "
exactly: he's a stranger. Since she had to look him up using his id they might not even know each other's names. What is he going to do to her exactly? And what is her family going to do? Excommunicate her for sleeping with an asshole or for having the guts to let somebody else know what their beloved fiance and father of her children is doing in his spare time?
Pretty sure he did that already. It is not on the OP whether or not to destroy a family. Don't put that on her. 
"I mean I've been the Shabecca and I've been the lrose2. When you're the Shabecca you ice out guys that approach you except to sing your less attractive friend's praises or talk up your imaginary boyfriend. You also pay attention to who your lrose2 likes and double ice those ones. When you're the lrose2 you let the Shabecca sort out the ones who really like you from the ones who don't, and if the Shabecca turns her full shine on all the guys to the point that it significantly impacts your romantic life, then you wish the Shabecca the best and withdraw from her orbit."
"Normally I'm thick skinned and all for turning the other cheek. I would normally advocate just walking away with your head held high. This thing is so repellent that I'm actually furious on behalf of an internet stranger I'll never meet, but more than that, I don't think you can let this go. I really think you should make your side of the story known on Facebook or whatever. 

Something like ""So turns out my loving boyfriend who I've been with for five years has been outright lying me for months, claiming I make him sleep on the floor, throw things and scream at him, that I had student loans he paid off for me (I had a full scholarship tyvm) even down to sending pictures to people of food I made claiming he made it for me and I was horrible to him about it. When I confronted him, he said it's because he likes the female attention he gets when he tells girls he stays with me because I'm such a mess I'm incapable of functioning without him. 
Well honey, let me relive you of that burden. Dumped.""

Honestly if I was one of those girls he's been spinning lies to, I'd want to know what a pathetic, amorphous, sack of lies he was. If I was his friend, I'd want to know so I knew exactly how far to trust him. If I was his family I'd want to know so I could get him into therapy. Seriously. "
"Hey, man. If you need someone to talk to, my inbox is open for you. Try to see if you can eat something-else, literally anything. See if you can even change the show to something-else. Any small victory. I went through a similar thing 4 years ago that had a serious impact on my life and ended up developing an eating disorder because I didn't take care of myself. Be careful what you do, I'm sorry for your loss."

"You feel ""trapped"" at home.

He won't let you use the car to go to the interview.

He won't let you have any access to ""his"" money that he earns...

This sounds like it's the beginning of the slippery slope to financial abuse. 

You need to have a Come to Jesus talk with him. You NEED to ask for:

1.) material support for working part time

2.) access to a joint account in which he deposits an agreed upon percentage of his paycheck

3.) freedom to goddamn leave the house whenever you want to because you're a grown up human being and this isn't 1800 when husbands could control their wives like this

Otherwise, I would *seriously* consider leaving/a separation."
"It sounds like you need to absolve yourself of your responsibility for his behavior. He was a manipulative selfish person. 

You did nothing wrong and his desire for sex outweighed his respect for your well being and resulted in abuse. 

Any decent person would have communicated their sexual needs to you in a respectful way based on their appreciation of your needs. The correct approach would have been to try and compromise or understand each other's needs or realise you weren't sexually compatible, not everyone is and trying to force it will never work. 

I hope you can use this experience to gain more confidence in setting your boundaries and better equip you to identify red flags and avoid toxic selfish people in the future. 

:Internet hug:"
Stop working on him. Use your limited time and contact to be warm and friendly instead of stressful and harping. 
"Where does it say she took a pass at his friends?


Also. No it's not normal to flip out at someone over their sexual past, wtf. She hasn't done him any damage. He never asked about her past.



If he wanted to pretend she was some virginal flower that's hardly her problem."
"TL:DR of comments in this thread.

OP gets rekt."
"&gt;Why do you bring in all the money AND do all the chores?

Presumably because he's working 70 hours a week trying to get a business up off the ground.

Frankly, it sounds like OP is making the sacrifices that are very typical for partners of someone trying to start a business; the business-owner needs to put in a lot of extra work so the other partner picks up the slack for the meantime."
"I'm sure you could buy something. I don't think you need to rent from her for fifteen years. Other ways of doing it could include: (1) You buy a house together, she rents the current house out, and uses the rent for the daughter (school fees etc). (2) You buy half the house from her and become a co-owner. Your purchase price goes back into assets quarantined for the daughter. There are probably other options as well."
"&gt;Ehh... this may not have been your GF's finest hour, but I also think sucking it up and acting nice towards your SO's annoying friends/family members is something you've just gotta do in a relationship sometimes. The ""I hate your friends"" conversation can be a VERY touchy one, particularly when it's a 10-year friend in question. So for some people, they just make the calculation that they might be annoyed by a particular friend but not *so* annoyed that it's a hill they want to die on with their SO. 

Hit the nail right on the head. Unless she's got a secret drinking problem which OP has said he thinks is unlikely, I really think she was just doing what she needs to do to keep things kosher. And OP blew up on her anyway. Poor girl can't win."
"WHeres the compromise though?

She doesn't want to pay him childcare (despite him taking on a significant part) because they're 'becoming a family unit' But she wants to take rent. She also wants to charge market rate for rent. 

She wants everything to go her way. How can he compromise if she's not willing to?"
"Hooking up. But I'm not sure it makes much of a difference, beside the sister risking to have her heart broken."
if you're this upset this quickly into a new relationship then you should just end it. You're crying over smoking for Pete's sake. 
"I think this sort of long, drawn-out breakup is the most painful. Basically, she's done with the boyfriend, but won't admit it to herself or him and so she keeps him in agony (crying alone) while actively cultivating her relationship with the other guy. I understand she is generally a good person in other areas of life, but that's a horrible way to treat someone. Also, if she is buying into the philosophy of a ""living in the moment"" guy who is actively blowing up his relationship with the mother of his child prepare for her to become a worse person. This new guy is actively selling her on his belief in selfishness.  

That said, I don't think texting her was the right way to go. What you were trying to convey to her was too complicated for that medium. The kind of advice you were trying to give is tough for people to take, no one wants to think they are treating someone unfairly, and is best given in person. If you were talking face-to-face, you could sandwich your advice with reassurance (""I love you, you are wonderful person, but..."") and she would be able to tell from your tone of voice and body language that you aren't harsh or judgmental toward her. "
"Sorry, but you are just going to have to move. She is not ""forcing"" you out of the apartment, you just don't want to be there under those terms."
"You've only been together a month. Are you completely sure she no longer makes videos like that? If she does, are you cool with that?

It could also be a case of a past partner uploading it without her knowledge unless it comes from an actual porn studio. I'd tell her just to get clarification on it and to make sure she's aware that it exists. You might be doing her a favor by telling her.

Just say something like ""So, I could be totally wrong, but I found a video with someone who looks exactly like you and while I'm totally fine with it, I just wanted to make you aware of it."""
"FWIW, Joey sounds like more of a real Myrtle Beach kind of guy instead of Charleston."
"Yeah if I'm holding a purse as well as two blown glass pieces of art, you better believe I expect the other person I'm with to offer to carry one so we are each responsible only for the safety of one piece. Same goes for shopping. Divide and conquer. "
"No! This relationship sounds very unhealthy. Neither of you should be laying your hands on each other during arguments, period. Don't stay with him just because it's been 2 years, this kind of interaction and fighting is not okay. It's abusive, and you need to leave. "
"I totally get that. And I'd be willing to sign a prenup and I told her as much. Although it my state it wouldn't ever become my house anyway. 

That's basically what I'm trying to say. We're acting as a family unit. I don't actually want her to pay me for child care I'm just trying to make the point that we're both contributing in different ways."
"If I can add a constructive 2cent contribution to this pile-on: I think it's pretty common, especially for younger people, to think that by acting as a go-between, we have enough personal power to smooth things over between people. We want to do right, and we trust our own powers of persuasion to convince others to do the right thing. Unfortunately, in the majority of circumstances, this instinct is flawed. We get sucked into enabling bad behaviour because we want to believe the best in people and in our own capabilities as peacemakers. (I've been here, for what that's worth)

You aren't going to fix your friend. You aren't going to make things right between him and the object of his affection. He hasn't even been honest with you about the extent of his harassing behaviour despite how close you are. He has told you what he wants you to hear to enable him further. If you continue to aid him by intervening with your mutual acquaintance, you will only hurt everyone involved. This is the time to set up boundaries. You probably can't have any contact with the stalked party, so I'd send her an unqualified apology for your role in this, a promise to not contact her in the future, and offer to corroborate her story if she goes to police. [EDIT: if she hasn't totally blocked you from social media and her email inbox.] I'd push for your friend to get professional help and to not protect him from investigation.  Finally, rethink your own capabilities as a negotiator in light of the outcome of this situation. It's not that you sound like a bad mediator, it's just that people are often worse than we give them credit for, and you cannot change someone's capacity to do bad things just because you like them as a person. "
"Agreed. The thing is, people seem to hit their late 20's and get discouraged because they ""have a string of failed relationships"" behind them. But that's how dating works! Relationships fail... until they don't. Every individual relationship is astronomically more likely to end than last forever. It is not a unique experience, or something to feel bad about.

I will say that it's really hard to forge a deeper connection if you're unwilling to be vulnerable with someone... and given your history and anxiety, that may be a thing for you. But there are plenty of people who don't date, don't marry, and live happy, full lives. Still, no need to make any grand sweeping pronouncements about the remaining 3/4 of your life you likely have ahead of you."
"Hmm, so I *want* to say that she is rejecting you, but then you said the following:

&gt;She told me that deep down she knows that I do not have feelings for her 

&gt;she told me that she doesn't believe anyone would truly like her

&gt;Both of us have never had a boyfriend or a girlfriend before if that helps

Honestly, is this an online friendship or have you met in person? 

If you really like her and want something more, you should initiate that conversation. It sounds like you casually told her you see her as more than a friend *in response to a comment ~she~ made*.

If you're ready to bite the bullet, you could just outright tell her:

""[name], I really like you and would like to date you. Would you like to go out to -"" and pick a date spot, like a restaurant.

If she tries to say things like ""no, you don't REALLY like me like that"", she has a lot of deep insecurities. Doesn't mean she isn't interested.

You could always counter it with, ""that's not fair to me; you can't read my mind and you don't experience my feelings for me. I mean what I am saying: I like you and would like to be more than friends. Would you want to? It's OK if not"".

Good luck!"
"Fight or flight reflexes are that - reflexes, not a show of character.

... the fact he drove off, didn't answer and didn't come back for long enough to involve someone else, *that's* bad, yeah. But even that could be one rational explanation away - dude might've wanted to get help, maybe he didn't have cell reception and didn't find his way back immediately(no clue how remote ""remote cabin in the woods"" actually is). Maybe he is extremely sleep-deprived.. he's only been a dad for 2 months so far, people have forgotten their new-borns in lesser circumstances than this. Not really anything we should be concerned with, though.

OP fucked up(you don't prank someone like that when they've got a small infant with them IMO) and apart from saying sorry there's not much he can do. The divorce is the wife's decision, not anyone else's."
"What OP did was childish, yeah, but I'm sorry, are you putting this all on him? 

Playing a prank on a mate when he's taking care of a newborn is stupid. Being the childish mate who always plays pranks until your friends decide to get back at you, and then *leaving your baby behind*, not answering your phone, and just never getting back to pick it up? 

OP made the situation, but there was plenty of time there to go back and pick up the baby. He didn't. His mate just fucked up. "
"This right here. Call her ""dad"""
"It isn't going to be just six months, though. OP's dad is going to live there and start a business. She has basically just learned that she is being completely abandoned by a husband who is taking all of the retirement money for himself and leaving her with nothing. I think I'd be pretty pissed off, too."
"If you are splitting it based on income, then she IS helping you with your loans. Because if you weren't, you'd be paying the bills all by yourself which would leave you with a lot less money to put toward your debt."
"&gt;Today she reveals that my father wants to invite me to his 60. birthday and she got pressured into asking me for my address.

The term used for people in this position are ""flying monkeys"".
Sometimes they don't know they are being used as such, but she did.  She could have been straight up to you and let you know the pressure she was under and let you decide how to approach it, but she didn't.  She threw you under the bus to save herself.  Remember that she had a choice, and she chose wrong.  She'll make the same choice again later, just remember that.

He will send more flying monkeys, so information diet for everyone else.

Your father is stalking you and not respecting your boundaries.
   Let your neighbors, landlord  and work know that your father can ""nasty"", and is highly manipulative, and not to give your personal information out.

He will show up at your front door.  If you are living with anyone, come up with a nice lie, like :""Oh yea, I just moved here a month ago.  Sorry, I don't know anyone by that name""

"
"OP, please find some resources about what ""gas lighting"" is. It sounds like he's gas lighting you by using your history of PPD as a way to invalidate your concerns and make you question their validity. "
"You are a nice guy for sticking through her mess, for sure. Now, I'm not trying to be unsympathetic to her - but she has been this way for at least 3 years. She dropped out of high school. She lives with her mom and doesn't help around the household. Blames you for neglecting her. At some point, she needs to take responsibility for her life, you are not responsible for her. She is not yours to fix. She is the captain of her ship. 

However, you seem like you have a lot going well for you - in college, works hard, likes to help others. It would be a pity if she dragged you down. Plus, you are only 23 years old, in my opinion, you don't need this type of stress on you. You can find a nice, hardworking, ambitious girl at your university who can lift you up, not bring you down. "
"&gt;""what can I do, sister is strong willed. Just let it be and it will ride over.""

Tell him that next time she does it to him. 

I would refuse contact with her. Report the post to FB, take her off your fb will a single comment, ""what I do with my periods is my business and you have no right to discuss my sanitary habits. Besides, I bet the amount of washing and detergent you use to wash them is no better"" 

"
"oh jeez-wha a weenie.

Joshua when you get weepy over my not wanting to watch a movie multiple times it feels very manipulative and unsexy to me.  Im drawing a boundary now that I will NOT watch a movie twice in the same week -Im happy o be in the room working on my own project while you watch it so long as you show me the respect of not interrupting my work on my project.""

Dont coddle his itsy bitsy feeeeeeeelings."
"This whole argument is stemming from her fear of your reaction to the text conversation. She hyped herself up the whole day thinking you were mad at her because she fantasizes about other people. Then you come home and stand off to the side so she can feed the cat. She interprets this as you being distant and mad. So she reaches out for affection from you. ""What about my kiss?"" This is where things start to go really wrong. Her insecurity about it, and your aloof behavior confirmed her irrational feelings about the conversation and exacerbated it until she had to physically remove herself from her anxiety by fleeing to her room. 

The fact that you did not pursue her to calm her down only further confirmed her irrational thoughts. Now she is feeling so much fear at losing you over this thing that she is displaying secondary emotions like anger in order to protect herself. At this point you have two options, you can immediately address her fear by saying

 ""Honey, I really don't mind if you fantasize about other people, it is not something so important to me that it could jeopardize this relationship.""  
 or 

You can let her go."
"&gt; I found another job opportunity cleaning an elderly woman's house (church member, no excuse there) weekly and my mom seems to be grasping at straws for a reason for me to not take that job either. 

I say go for this. It sounds like she can't actually come up with a reason to stop you. 

&gt; What can I do to convince my mom that I should be allowed to work or at least gain some independence? 

To be honest, if your mother is as uncompromising as you describe, there is no convincing her. She has her own ideas about how the world should work and how her daughter should behave, and she is not changing from them. So, as best you can, you need to work within the perametres she's setting. Cleaning for an elderly church member is a good idea. If you do well, maybe you'll get other clients from the church as well. My only concern is that your mother would try to convince them to not pay you, or will insist that you do this work ""out of the goodness of your heart"". 

If you think your mother is reasonable (and she honestly doesn't sound like it), have a talk with her and explain that you will soon become an adult and you *need* experience in the world in order to become a self-sufficient independent adult. But honestly, you may get more mileage out of toeing the line until you're 18.

Honest question, what kind of punishments do you face if you ignore her ""enforcements""? Does she yell at you? Guilt you? Hit you? You've described your dad as being onside before, could you get him onside again?

I mean, if the worst she's going to do is sulk at you, by all means, go get a job. But if she will make your life terrible, toe the line, scrape whatever money you can, then make an escape once you turn 18. Luckily, it's not that far away.  "
"As terrifying as it may be, if she spent the last 10 years resisting the urge with her long-term boyfriend, and you spent the last 10 years enjoying the company of several different women... you might just not be compatible with the girl of your 13-year-old self's dreams.

Just tell her. She's asking directly because she wants to know. She is perfectly aware that it's a small town too. She knows what she is asking.

Quite honestly, unless you think you can *perfectly* keep those names from her forever (and you can't, that's not realistic) then just tell her now, and be upfront and transparent. 

There is no guarantee of success, but that is your safest move by far."
"Hey, I used to work for the teachers union and dealt with the public schools in Philly A TON. I know principals and school staff in a lot of places. Also we have a kiddo who goes to a public school in Philly. If you need help finding a good school, PM me and I can help you."
"Number one... you don't get to have a BF for 3 years, feel horrible about the relationship, then find a new guy, and two weeks later you're already at a ""cross roads"" where you're thinking of dumping your boyfriend and making something happen with the new guy... and then call that ""poly"".  Lol.  That is *not* how poly works.  What you're doing is called ""looking for a new job while I'm still employed at the old one"", and its not the same thing as poly.

The big mistake that you're in danger of here, is that without even realizing it, you're taking your BF for granted.  Now, hear me out.  I'm not saying he's a good person, or that its a good relationship.  What I'm saying is that your boyfriend is sort of like a comfortable old pair of shoes.  The thing about an old pair of shoes is, they start to look old and worn out, and you think about replacing them.  You think about how much nicer a new pair would look, etc.  But, what you never realize until you actually buy the new pair of shoes is, breaking in a new pair of shoes is a dicey proposition.  You can think they look great in the store, but get them home and suddenly you hate them.  Or they maybe look great, but they don't really fit your feet quite as well as the old pair, so you're super uncomfortable in them for a few weeks.  What I'm getting at is, right now with your boyfriend, even with as much as he's NOT giving you that  you need, one thing he is doing is grounding  you and giving you a sense of security and stability, and alot of your happiness comes from that sense of stability and comfort, even if its boring most of the time.  

What can often happen in situations like this one, is you dump your boyfriend, then find out the new guy was waaaaaaaaay more interested in you when you were attached than he is now that you're single. When you were attached, you were just someone he could chat with and date once in a while.  But now that you're single and he's got to do alot more of the heavy lifting, he becomes way less interested in you and he backs off.  Now you're single, and the new guy is slowly ghosting you, and suddenly you look back on life with your boyfriend and realize, shit, I left him for the first flash in the pan that came along and caught my eye with its shiny flashyness, and in the process I walked away from a pretty good thing that while not ideal, was probably fixable.

So, my advice would be, stop worrying about the guy you met two weeks ago, who is, you know, basically not much more than a complete stranger to you.  And, start worrying more about trying to fix the relationship with the guy you've invested about a tenth of your life in.

Sit down with your boyfriend, tell him you feel unfulfilled in the relationship, to the point where you've considered leaving him.  Then, list for him, the specific reasons you're not happy with the relationship. Then, list for him, the *specific* things  you'd like to see him do or change, in order for you to feel fulfilled in the relationship.  Then, give him a chance to do those things.  

And if you're going to start seeing every guy who steps into your life for 20 minutes as being a potential replacement for your boyfriend... at least do him the favor of being honest with him about that, instead of hiding behind the curtain of ""poly"".  Poly means you love both of them and are in simultaneous relationships with both of them: It doesn't mean you pick which of them you like better and dump the other."
"I agree with the other posters but want to add one thing- grief counselling. Even if she thinks she doesn't need it right now, it can be a huge help.

My grandma died 3 months ago and my mum and I nursed her while she was dying. I thought I had come to terms with it (I wasn't crying every day, I got to say goodbye to her, and I was able to return to work right away), but I started going to grief counselling anyways because I haven't experience loss with trauma like that (the way she died was horrible to watch). What I wasn't expecting was the flood of grief and overwhelming guilt I started feeling *last week*. I thought I was ""over"" her death/how she died but really I had been immediately thrown back into a bad work situation and buried everything under work stress.  Once the work stress was over and we had grandma's little interment, I turned into a complete wreck. Like, breaking down in tears just sitting at my desk.  

 So whether she uses you as a sounding board or a grief counsellor, sometimes it just helps to *talk*. It helped me immensely to know that my feelings and reactions are normal (seriously, who starts breaking down 3 months later? I thought I was alone when I wasn't).  But I also found other people kind of overwhelming, so just be supportive if she needs to have some quiet time alone to process everything."
"I'm sorry OP. I agree with you; if he has a girlfriend then why is he still studying how to pick up women? Even if he hasn't been physically cheating, I wouldn't be surprised if he's at least been flirting with other women. If he's so into this I think it would be naive to think that he's only be studying the theory and not putting it into practice."
"Pretty shitty of you to kick her out when she's not done anything wrong except not return a crush on your end. It sounds like you were getting on okay, you got too close and offended her with the GED question and now she's pulling back. All normal behaviour, now you need to find a way to deal with your awkwardness.

The GED question was rude and condescending. In general, if someone hasn't done what you perceive to be a 'normal' educational thing (finish high school, go to college, finish college, whatever), there's probably a reason for it and it's rude to offer your opinion unsolicited. Do you think she doesn't know it's beneficial to get a GED? Do you think no one has ever brought it up with her before? I suspect that your attitude in this post combined with the fact that you're ten years older than her probably made you come off as extremely patronizing. 

This is just one of those times in life when you need to suck it up and accept the consequences of your own behaviour. IDK if this is your apartment or if you have any power to actually kick her out but it would be an incredibly immature move to evict someone who hasn't done anything just because you can't get over an unrequited crush. Date outside of your household. "

"But puppies are the worst.  Yes they are adorable, they have to be because they are horrible little creatures.  I grew up with dogs too but nothing prepared me for raising a puppy on my own.  Getting up at 1 AM, 2 AM, 3 AM, 4 AM to take her out to the bathroom.  The housebreaking in general sucked.  Taking her to training classes because she was a puppy and didn't know how to act around other dogs without being a little jerk.  I wouldn't trade her for the world but I would also not get another puppy, ever.

"Hey OP, I see by your edit that you have it figured out, but I want to throw in my 2 cents...

I was addicted to League for a couple years and completely killed my relationship in very similar circumstances to yours. I didn't want to stop playing or talking to my friends. But I spent *so much* free time doing it. Even when I said ""I'll only play X times a week"" I would end up going back to it. My relationship had other issues, but man did I make it 1000x worse. I eventually quit League for good (though like a year afterwards) and honestly my life has improved tremendously. 

When I say addicted I'm not joking around. I played for hours a day. All my hobbies fell to the side. My mental state and self-worth was so tied up in my rank. It was awful for me and my relationships. Even now I still get the urge to play it and go back to that lifestyle and it takes a lot of willpower to resist.

You may be able to balance it with your life, so power to you, but please don't underestimate how serious of an issue it can be!"
"&gt;will be turning 18 in about two weeks.

No need."
"&gt;She doesn't seem to realize that I want to move out once I become 18 and by not even letting me get my feet wet I don't feel I will be as prepared as I would like to be.

She does realise it. She knows it very well. She's doing all of this in order to control you and keep you at home and under her full control forever. 

Just follow what this marvellous Redditor said:

&gt;I was in your shoes. I never did get the OK for the job so I did two things.

&gt;First I started planning. Making budgets. Make a resume that included things like babysitting and volunteering and my grades. Gathered my papers like birth certificate and as card. Find out how it works having health insurance when you don't live at home. Research jobs and how to interview, etc.

&gt;Then I found a friend who would let me live with her for cheap rent. This was to help me to move out sooner.

&gt;The moment I turned 18 I got a job and was able to move out three weeks later. I didn't make much because it was part time but it was a start. I gave my friend $200 a month, ate frugally, save save save. Be on top of those bills. Get a bank account and a bank card. Make it happen.

There will be no negotiating with your mother once you turn 18, either. She's going to clamp down on you and try as hard as she can to make it impossible for you to move out. Because regardless of what she says, this is not about her love for you, this is about her need to control you. She will say things to try and manipulate you and guilt trip you and make you feel like a selfish or bad person for wanting to move out and live your own life (which IS NOT selfish!). I'm guessing she already uses guilt trips and emotional manipulation to turn things around on you and make you feel bad for wanting your basic human rights. Don't let her do it. Don't continue to be her prisoner. Start putting a plan in action now, so you're ready to move out ASAP because if you don't, it will never end. I see threads on this sub pretty often from young people as old as their 20s who have allowed their controlling parents to keep them at home, with no job and no freedom. You don't want to become one of them. Your life already sounds insufferable, and it'll only get worse the longer you remain at home.

Freedom is not granted, it is seized."
"You don't approach it. She has a boyfriend. Keep it casual and focus on other people. If at some point she no longer has a boyfriend, then feel free to go for it. "
"This will be hard, but your relationship won't last unless you are honest. Because it's already breeding resentment, and where there's resentment, there's avoidance. 


&gt;My boyfriend wants to be with me 24/7 and doesnt give me space. 

This is really unhealthy. Look up ""codependence"", you'll find a lot of resources. The antidote to codependence is  *setting boundaries*. And it's really hard. Because

&gt;I feel it's difficult to tell him that I need a little space some times without him being offended. 

Yup. As soon as you set one little boundary - ""I'd like to go to the gym with a friend"" - he will act hurt, offended, and angry. He will pout and stomp. He will be passive-aggressive (or just aggressive). He will act as if your normal, rational boundary is a stab in the back worthy of argument and blame. He doesn't WANT you to set boundaries. He wants what he wants, and if you don't give him what he wants, he will act out and make sure you KNOW how unhappy he is, and he wil punish you and make you feel like a monster who hurt him deeply and damaged the relationship. Why? Because it's effective. He knows it will work, and if you feel bad, he can control you again and get what he wants. 


&gt;How can I occasionally make small plans (ie going to the gym with a friend) without having to have him tag along all the time?

1.  Set boundaries. Be assertive and clear. ""I will be going to the gym with my friend today. Just us.""  Him: No! I want to go! It's not fair! Go at a different time, when I can come along, you're really making me mad."" You:  (calmly, NOT apologizing, NOT defending, NOT justifying:) ""We'll go together another time and right now I am going alone with my friend, and that's the end of the discussion. Goodbye."" 
 
2.   Be honest. Tell him how you feel, and call him out on his guilt trips and manipulations. When he says ""You're going out without me? I want to go too!"" be honest. ""No. You're not invited. I feel like it is very unhealthy for you to assume that we have to do everything together. I don't want to do everything together, I want time with my friends.""  Him:  ""Oh, so you're saying you don't want to be with me or spend time with me? Fine, maybe you should just break up with me!""  Call him out. ""You're trying to manipulate me, and I don't appreciate it. It's perfectly reasonable for me to go out and spend time with my friends.  If we are going to stay together, you have to know that I can't handle this level of clinginess from you."" Him: ""If you think I'm this clingy, then go then. I'll just sit here all alone, by myself. It's what I deserve. You think I'm terrible."" You:  ""Again, you are trying to manipulate me by pulling a guilt trip. This relationship won't work if you do that, because I will just get SUPER resentful. So enough with the guilt trips. I get that you want to spend every moment with me. What I am telling you is that I DO NOT WANT THAT. So we need to come up with a solution that works for us that does NOT involve us spending all of our time together, because I am burned out.""

3.   Be prepared, after setting boundaries and communicating honestly, to see that you might not be compatible. This is the hardest thing. Because you might really love each other. But if he NEEDS a partner to be by his side 24 / 7, and he absolutely cannot or will not compromise at all, and you NEED a relationship where you have a little independence and autonomy, and the thought of spending 24 / 7 with your bf makes you feel resentful and angry every time you think of it, then you are not compatible."

Seeing you two, who were both not  fans of this guy, get together and lead happy lives is a head trip for her, because it shows you both have your lives relatively together, and that functional people and relationships exist. Then she has to confront the fact that she stayed with this guy and has multiple kids with him, so no, no matter what, he has a permanent place in her life. Sometimes misery loves company.

"Unfortunately, it's not up to OP whether or not Nicole has an abortion. Especially if Nicole does go against the abortion and has the baby after OP tried to convince her not to.

Realistically, an abortion is the more reasonable choice at that age, but we have no idea what Nicole's beliefs or family situation is like.

It's not OP's place to, either. That's for the actual guardians in this situation (Nicole's guardians and their aunt). Their aunt and Nicole's parents/guardians need to be informed asap because this is a time sensative issue. OP can lend her support to her little brother and Nicole, especially if things start to go south, but she should not be the go to here, especially in regards to Nicole.

They go to the lounge where everyone works and sit next to each other on the couch with their shoes off and their bare feet inches apart. They do their own responsibilities when necessary (they have some separate classes, but one together), but always find each other afterwards. She is in his office very frequently, sometimes with the door closed.
I literally overhead two other grad students talking and saying, ""What's going on with Bob and Alice?"" The time they spend together and their constant flirting is being noticed.

This is the bit I was referring to;
&gt;Why this has been making me especially sad is because Bob almost seems like he is purposely trying to spend less time with Brittany - he used to make a point of always being home early (by 7pm) so they could spend the evening together. It was almost a running joke in the department. But over the past few weeks, he has stayed, shoulder to shoulder, with Alice on the couch in the lounge, until 9,10,11 at night. Sometimes they sit in silence working on their individual work. Sometimes they very very obviously flirt. But whatever they are doing, they do it together. All the time.

etc."
"&gt;going into sunk-cost fallacy mode

So glad you know about this! Being aware of it is the first step to reasoning your way out. You know this already, but just to put it concretely into words: Those 2 years are over no matter what you do now. You can't change the past. All you can do now is make the choices that will give you the brightest future. 

Another way of thinking about it I saw once that I really liked is this: People sometimes forget that a bad relationship is WORSE than no relationship at all. A single person is one step away from finding a great relationship. They just have to meet the right person. Someone in a bad relationship is two steps away: They have to get out of their bad relationship before they can get into a great one. 

Take yourself one step closer to greatness!"

The stress of weddings makes a lifelong commitment extremely difficult, even if you're with your perfect mate (and this is coming from someone who had a $2000 wedding). EVERYONE has doubt, just to varying degrees. The hard part is figuring out whether that fear is justified or not.

That said, I don't think OP should get married. I'm just saying that in general, nervousness about getting engaged/married is 100% normal and should be expected."

Ultimatums rarely work well, but it sounds like she either has to agree to open the marriage (which may not work out in the end), agree to cut contact with her friend and probably attend couples counseling so you both can understand what she was getting out of this new relationship and how to repair your current one, or you move forward with a divorce."

I have to stop my hobbies, cancel my gym subscription, stop gaming.(which are the only things i do to relax)
She doesn't stop her hobby (the horses) since they are mandatory.

"Plus it's not like it'll be a one time thing, unless they are very very lucky and fertile. It could take years before she gets pregnant, doing it the ""natural"" way is absurd. Imagine the strain on the relationship that doing it the ""natural"" way could cause. Yes artificial insem. through a clinic is expensive, but so is a kid and so is a divorce.

*edited to add I think OP should tell his parents, even though he is an adult; this is a really really strange request that could land him in a lot of trouble and doesn't seem terribly well intentioned."
"I wouldn't quite trust that ""working late"" thing, either. Selfish people tend to be selfish in more ways than one."
"Hunger Games was also a book series before it became a movie, and most definitely complex enough to take on Star Wars."
"I'm going to try and phrase this a little nicer... I think you do like him mostly, but that there's a big quirk that even you have a difficult time over looking. 

From your original post and your comments in the comments section, it sounds like you're a nice person, but also that your relationship is still in the early stages where you're still figuring out what you like and what you don't like about each other. It also sounds a bit like you want him to change his humor or his behavior around it. 

To be blunt, it's generally not a good sign when you want to change someone you're in a relationship with (unless it's something like alcoholism, but then you might need to just walk away). 

Maybe you should take more time to get to know each other before you throw in the business of other people? Good luck!"
"I'm with you man, I see this as harmless fun, a little bit of ribbing with your work mates.

The only way I could see this being a ""downside"" would be if you like, stole someone's shit, lied and said their child was kidnapped or did something sexual in nature. Like post a bunch of dick pics in her cube. lol"
"Yeah, if she doesn't want to give him up and she doesn't abuse him, her losing custody is almost impossible. "
"I mean, women are funny in that we're all different. I would ADORE if a man brought me at least flowers on the first date, especially since it seems you two are flirty and crushing a bit already. And knowing about her favorite chocolates? Again, personally, I would swoon. It would be weird if we were a blind date or had met online, but you two have a rapport already. But anyway, again, that's me.

My point being, don't overthink these things; just focus on having fun and being yourself. Come back and update us! :) "
" Because ultimately, his willpower highlights her failings."
I mean I'd tell my wife first...but either way I'd do both ASAP.

This is kind of beside the point but at no time in the last 50 years did anyone make a copy of that information?
surprised I had to scroll so far to see this. you don't make another person's animal sick and let them foot the bill; she should be paying it herself!
as are many NYC schools. you need to figure out where you would be purchasing and what the district would be like before you make that decision. 
"You are working SO hard to justify cheating with this dude. Cheating isn't wrong because of the possibility that someone will find out, and other people doing something wrong doesn't make you doing it less wrong.

I took a look at your post history and I think you're feeling such a strong pull to cheat because you're not happy in this relationship. Your boyfriend is immature and directionless.

I think you need to leave your boyfriend altogether and certainly do not sleep with this other man. Do not be a participant in destroying someone else's marriage."
"Thanks. I think we are both selfish, and stubborn, which is why we work well together - but part of the reason I posted this is because maybe I'm being too selfish. It's hard to tell whether this is the right move, but I'm going with my gut, which is telling me that I'm not happy with the status quo."
"&gt; Some other points struck me in your post: you haven't lived together before and you will be buying a house together soon after the wedding, and you fiancé is now going out at night with friends rather than talking to you. The former makes me worry about how you will adjust to living together (particularly if his solution to problems is to make ultimatums which will force events to go his way) and the latter suggests that he will deliberately avoid communication with you to the detriment of your relationship.

Yeah, that's terrifying. In a year, she'll be legally and financially tied to this guy and totally fucked.  Heck, I can just imagine how house-shopping with this jerk will go.  

And general note to the world: purchasing a house as your first experience in cohabitation is a *horrific* idea.  "
I know. My job is quite demanding and there are nights where I don't get home till my kids are in bed. I have talked to their doctor who claims that the kids are healthy and there's nothing wrong with what my wife is doing.
"I personally don't see anything wrong with that, but she claims it's 'extra food' and that it'll lead to obesity."
"Hi! Thank you for your reply! I would like to wait until late June/early July to start my project, so the baby will be a few months old. This project is in no way a long term project. I plan on making a design and projecting it onto the wall so I can cut the time I work on it to maybe 4 or 5 days. This mural is in no way 'fancy fancy'. Maybe some cartoon vegetables in tennis shoes, haha! "
"Plus, if I report the snapchat thing, it gets Jessica in trouble too. Soooo... UGH. "
"Personally, I'd find it hard to cope with because I do have insecurity, but I would try to become good friends with Elle myself and then make it so when she is around, you can be close to her too and it could be more comfortable. If you're going to be a part of Robert's life forever and plan a family with him, you're going to be closer to him than her. But if he has her around a lot, then you should endeavour to be as close to her as possible, like really befriend her is in your best interest, and hers too. "
"My young kids (all under 6) eat more than that most days and they're all at very healthy weights with no excess fat...

Also, that all sounds very low fat. Kids NEED healthy fats for their growing brains (nuts, dairy, coconut oil, whatevs.)."
If it's that bad why do you keep him around? Why not find someone else?
"there is a pretty large age gap between kids, with her being about 9 years older than the brother.  In many ways she may consider him her 'kid' , and be weirdly protective of him as a result. She may not have a real relationship with the youngest sibling due to the bigger age gap and may have been able to dismiss it like it happ Ned to
Someone else.  "
"Yeah, agree with this. "
You say he writes sometimes and gets paid via paypal and amazon - this makes me think he could be making his money from either writing or drawing on commission. Paypal is a pretty typical way to pay for commissioned art of any genre &amp; I know some people self publish ebooks on amazon. Maybe he won't tell you because he finds the subject matter embarrassing?
"Marriage is an active choice to stay together. When that choice stops, the marriage ends.

Cheating is a betrayal. That's the problem. It's not the right way to handle the choice to end a marriage."
I wouldn't call a parent buying a kid a toy to make him happy awful. Maybe misguided or inexperienced but not awful. 
"Yeah you can. That's what dating is, figuring out which imperfections are tolerable in a partner and which aren't. "
"Something along the lines of ""my dad was at such-and-such a place and came across a pic of you and James from years ago hanging on wall""??"
"You said she had a Spanish accent but her parents were European - idk I took that as you thinking that wasn't possible (I'm tired it's been a long day) 

Did you tell her that? She might have been more upfront if she knew how you felt. I still think she just got a bit freaked out by it. "
In what world is it a normal thing to tell your parents about your SO's dating history??? Maybe she didn't tell him because his parents are over involved weirdos and she want to deal with it getting back to them. 
You are an adult.  You do not need anyone's permission to do anything  you choose to do.  It is YOUR life.  
"She still thought it was ok to drink at least 6 beers while watching the kids, and lying to you about it.  How would you feel if a kid got injured under your mom's watch? 


Your mom made the decision to drink, so she loses access to your kids.  


If you want to save your marriage, and possibly your mom, you have to have your mom move out.  It's not your job to find her a place; it's her job.   


If you want to help her with her alcohol addiction AFTER she moves out: google NPS and alcohol addiction.  Research shows that this addiction is due to a chemical imbalance in the brain.  Can be treated by meds, but most US doctors aren't aware of this treatment. "
Did you even read the post? They were together for years before hand. It's not like they just met. 
"My SO and I have the same issue where work often throws last minute things at him, and dinner goes cold. I used to do the same thing where I'd wait for him or expect a text, and because of how his work gets, it became painfully obvious he wasn't always able to text me to let me know. We resolved this by planning separate meals - I no longer cook for both of us, and eat when I want to. If he comes home on time, he'll text me ahead of time (since that's much more rare) and I can make enough for both of us. As much as I want to eat dinner with him, it works much better for us this way, and I don't have to feel less appreciated when the meal goes cold. 

Also, be the bigger person and stop being so passive aggressive. Instead of putting the food away when it was clear he wasn't going to come home on time, you chose to make a dramatic act out of throwing the food away and washing the dishes. Both of you obviously didn't react the best way, but I've been through the exact same scenario and it takes much more to be the bigger person and stop the argument before it has a chance to begin. "

"Yeah, I think that's a good assessment of it. "
"Since she feels that you shouldn't go into a relationship trying to change people, my answer would be to end the relationship. If she (a person) can't see the ignorance in that conversation style, without they're being a mental disability present, I couldn't deal with it. She's telling you that she's not going to change, so you have determine how much this bothers you."
"That's all correct -- she packed everything for my dad's relatives, then flips out.

My mom told in me in the hospital that she wants to return everything. She still has the reciepts.

We don't know what exactly triggered her to want the luggage back. 
"
"Another lady here. I've cried after sex with 3 different SO's for various reasons. Usually it's either a serious rush of endorphins and feeling loved and happy after a particularly wonderful love-making session, or  as serious period of stress has be an emotional ball and an orgasm is an incredible release. Like your girlfriend, sometimes the tears are just little trickles, sometimes it's a full-on crying session. My fiancé will notice when I'm about to start a sob fest and will stop (even if he's close to orgasm himself) and hold me tight to his chest for after-care to help me ride out the emotional wave. He's wonderful. 

I've also read somewhere that there is a small point in the vagina on the upper wall near the cervix that, when stimulated, can basically cause the release of emotions. I also have heard that a women who do yoga can sometimes have a serious emotional experience while doing particular hip-opening poses. So, it might be a physiological thing, it might be psychological, could just be good sex. Whatever it is, just love on her while she cries and talk to her."
"It may not just be jealousy-- it's also a way of proving her worth in the group, that she's necessary and valuable and has a certain amount of social credit. It's probably also about control and about how nice it is to feel like the caretaker, the one that's bigger/older/stronger and looks after the others. 

Either way, a flat, ""yeah, that's not happening."" and move on. Don't let her pull you back into the conversation, if she says you're jealous, say, ""no, I don't think that's what it is. I don't want my friends to think of me as their mom, I want them to think of me as their friend."""
"Once you've apologized for things that are reasonably your fault, there's nothing more you can do. If your partner asks to be left alone, leave them the fuck alone. You don't get to decide how to resolve the issue for him. 

He's asking for space and you don't give it. I know that if someone's in my face, trying to tell me how I feel, there's no way I'd be able to communicate effectively. Your partner is reasonable to be resentful.

It's okay to put a conversation on hold to finish later. My SO and I do this all the time. If it becomes too heated, we take a break and finish it when we're in a better head space. The next time your partner wants space, you say ""okay, I'd like to finish this conversation later."" and drop it for now. Later, if the timing is good, you say ""can we talk about X problem? I'd like to finish our conversation about it."""
"&gt; First off, stop labeling her intentions and desires as heteronormative. She's a gay woman too. Deciding in your own mind that she must want to emulate a straight couple is pretty disrespectful.

I didn't know how to say this from the position of a straight man.... but you're right. This is going to boil down to one or two things, or a combination of them: taking a name, and ""is this wedding gay enough?""


Both issues can be talked through... if OP tries to do that."
"She does seem to have the skill for it, but making your hobby into a career can take the joy out of it. Maybe she could freelance for law enforcement. That's totally a thing right?"
Here lies the issue. The not responding to your text straight away means very little when he's done all that. You really need to rethink your relationship. Do you see or even want a future with this guy? 
"Like I said, your boyfriend isn't going to change. Are you happy staying with him if he never changes? Or are you with him because you've ""seen the man you know he really is inside""? Because OP, I have some news for you: the asshole who doesn't help out around the house and disrespects the work that you put into the house **IS** the guy you're dating. There is no hidden prince charming that'll show up. Either be happy with what you have or move on because your boyfriend won't change, at least not for you."
"Once you broke up with your ex, she no longer had any obligation towards you. Thus, while probably a poor personal choice to sleep with someone immediately after breaking up, it is her right to do so.

Your best friend is supposed to be loyal to you. Sleeping with an ex (particularly a very recent ex after a long term relationship) is the height of shittiness. That is grounds for a friendship breakup.  Packed belongings and no contact once someone has moved."
[deleted]
"I'm not talking specifically about OP. OP doesn't have much choice because of her apartment layout anyway. I'm talking about the characterization of room sharing parents as clingy and anxious, which is a common and harmful view. I don't want other non-parents reading this and agreeing and going on to judge people over it, and I don't want new parents reading it and feeling like they're doing something wrong."
"They will keep taking your money until you put a stop to it.

Do not worry about your mother in law. Her situation is not your problem and you will not change her.

You and your wife need to get on the same page. If you stop lending/giving them money this will cause conflict down the road. You need to talk to your wife FIRST, persuade her that it is time to put your own marriage/family first, and that her father will not change as long as what he is doing continues to work for him. Your wife probably feels responsibility to her parents but in the long run it is better for everyone to let them learn from their mistakes.

Once you and your wife are in agreement, do not lend money, do not use your credit card, and be very clear that the loans/gifts are over. Stick to it and your father in law will find another person to take advantage of."
"Your kids are at the age where you will be forming your own traditions as a nuclear family.  For example, you'll probably want Christmas to be at your house where ""Santa can find you"".  She needs to get with the program and accept that if she wants to join you for holidays, she needs to be flexible and either be willing to come to you or let you 4 have some space to grow your own traditions."
There was a girl in one of my elementary school classes whose parents just *made up* a name for her. Basically just mashed three syllables together. It was very weird and substitutes always asked her about it. She always had to explain it and clearly did not like it.
"Sounds good to me. If you want to add a tiny carrot to the stick, you could also tack on something like, ""It's regrettable that you are hurt by this but it is not up for discussion. If you are feeling better by [date], we would still love to see you for [future event].""

Then refuse to respond to any further guilt-bombing about the subject. Just ignore her until she figures out this type of behavior won't get her what she really wants. 

If she escalates, continue putting off seeing her. ""We've decided to take a break from visiting until you start respecting our decisions. We still love you but this is important."""
"Stop calling it stalking. She isn't stalking.

She is researching strangers in depth, which is a really weird and time consuming hobby, but it's not stalking.

She is using public information, but digging it out more than the avg. person would. That's it. 

It's only stalking if she harasses them, or invades their privacy. 

I hate how people think that fb and reddit should be ""private"" and anyone who figures out your identity and reads all your comments is ""stalking"" you. Not how the internet works folks. "
"Never say never. He's been abusive to you, he could be abusive to them. Please don't be that parent who thinks that a relationship with an abuser is more important than not being abused. "
"&gt; She says that the guy she cheated on me with wasn't what she wanted, and that she made a huge mistake. She said she didnt connect with him, he had major temper problems and just in general didn't want to be with him anymore.

She told him the good news that you broke up and he said no thanks. She rejected you then he rejected her and she had nothing so she came back to you. If he would have taken her she would have stayed with him. He had major temper problems yet 2 days earlier she had feelings for him. You were Plan B. You swept it under the rug 11 years ago but it didn't go away. Rugsweep it again and you can bet it will come back up."
"I guess I understand that, it's just not something I would've consider doing unless I had been told prior. It's something she should have communicated beforehand (""I wonder what the baby's gunna get me...""). To have a wonderful birthday ruined over this is a little ridiculous. "
"Ahaha! Was he a virgin before you guys got together? ;-)

Seriously, though, it sounds like 1. he'd like you to initiate more often and 2. he's getting his advice from PUA websites (i.e., negging you by saying you're not a normal woman if you don't seduce him several times a week). If your relationship is otherwise OK, I'd try to get to the bottom of where he got this weird idea and then go from there."
"If my sister told - not asked or discussed, but *told* me that she was using the same name as a baby I had lost, I'm pretty sure my reaction would be the same as OPs. Even with the mother connection I cannot fathom why or how the sister thought that this was acceptable or okay. It's incredibly hurtful - almost spiteful, to be quite honest. "
"This is a pretty common problem: when an unreasonable person and a reasonable person argue, people tend to try to convince the reasonable person not to escalate regardless of who's in the right because they believe that there's no point in trying to change an unreasonable person, since they can't be reasoned with.

What they ignore is the emotional toll it takes on a reasonable person to constantly be forced to bend to someone making unreasonable demands of them. I would explain it to him that way - it's not about changing her, it's about supporting you. He doesn't support you when he chooses to avoid someone else's anger because it's too inconvenient to stand up for you."
"This is definitely something that some people are perfectly fine with, and for some people it's simply a dealbreaker.

I would suggest giving it another week or two. If you feel weird having sex with him or find yourself unable to view him as a sexual being anymore, it's time to dump him. It's completely normal to be turned off by someone your sibling has essentially ""had"". Just remember you're only 3 months in and there's literally a billion guys out there that haven't received a lap dance from your sister. "
"So your dad took a picture of a picture on some wall and then sent it to you?

How does he even know it's them? How do **you** even know it's them? 

edit: unless this picture was labeled with their names, then realistically your dad has absolutely zero way of confirming it was her (or him). Maybe your dad isn't a huge fan of her (or him) and had some sort of motive by sending it to you. Or maybe your dad likes drama and just wanted to stir the pot. Who knows. 
My gut tells me that it could be her, or could be him, but it's highly unlikely that it's the two of them together. In any case, the past is just that, and it shouldn't have any sort of bearing on your life today. "
"&gt; Fyi nobody i know knows one of those people...

You shouldn't say things like this out loud."
"That sort of stigma against marrying outsiders is a way to preserve culture. If too many young people marry outside the culture and raise their kids in either a mixture of cultures or without Hawaiian culture, then eventually native Hawaiian culture will fade away. His parents don't just want grandkids, they want grandkids who are Hawaiian and who carry on the family's culture and traditions. 

All that being said, Kane is an individual. He gets to decide to his priorities and who he marries. I think you should just be there for him and keep talking to him. Don't pressure him to choose you, but make it clear you do want him if he'll have you. Tell him you'll give him space if he needs it, because you understand this is very difficult for him, but don't do it unless he makes it clear that's what he wants (if you just give him space without being asked it could come across as rejection).

If you two do marry and have kids, carefully consider together what part Hawaiian culture and identity will play in you shared life. Will you live in Hawaii? How will Hawaiian culture be a part of your family's culture and the lives of your children?"
Because he's still comparing himself to high school jocks while everyone else grew up
"Your girlfriend sounds like an immature jerk.  Seriously, she's 32 and she's popping off about stuff even most 16 year old girls wouldn't. You don't need that kind of person in your life. You should just leave her alone."
"You need to move out.  Your mental and emotional well-being are more important than the ability to buy a house.  Get an apartment and get out.  Even if it takes another year before you can afford a house, that's okay.

BTW, there are a lot of other expenses involved in buying a house beyond just the downpayment.  You'll need to pay a house inspector, pay loan fees, transfer taxes, fees to have the deed recorded, surveyor (if desired), prepaid property taxes, and homeowners insurance, to name the expenses I can remember off the top of my head.  These can add thousands of dollars more to the cost of buying a home.  So make sure your savings goals reflect those expenses.

And if your husband doesn't want to rent, he can start doing more of the cooking and cleaning."
"&gt; you're living in her house, eating the food there, using water and electricity, etc.

You haven't actually responded to OP's point at all. OP doesn't say he doesn't want to pay for food, water and electricity. He specifically says he thinks they should split all bills and expenses. His point is that he doesn't want to pay an additional amount for ""rent"" when his girlfriend isn't paying a mortgage."
"well, it sounds like you'd be ok paying rent if she still had a mortgage right?

(using simple numbers, ignoring insurance etc)

So if her mortgage was $1000/mo, you'd be paying 500/500 each (maybe 600/400 or whatever, doesn't really matter), and you wouldn't be getting equity.

Instead you're wanting to pay 1000/0, with the same end result of no equity for you. If the mortgage was 10months, that puts you $5000 richer, her $5000 poorer, and that's assuming she wasn't going to rent it out.


Now, if you guys do end up getting married, it's a wash, you would combine finances anyway. But if you break up (shit happens), in scenario b she's out a lot of money, and you're up a lot.

I don't get why scenario a or b should be paid differently,they're effectively the same thing. It's just shifting if the nest egg is in cash, or in the mortgage


Edit:

Also,out of curiosity,do you know if she was renting (or planning to rent) the other parts of the house if you weren't moving in? I think that matters a lot,too."
"Stop hanging out. Stop talking. Don't get your families together.

He's your ex for a reason."
"I normally don't discuss it at all. When the bill is dropped I pull out my wallet. The guy either insists on paying the whole thing, or we split it. I've never brought it up before hand, nor have any of my friends. "
"That's one thing I really struggle with tbh. How much to put my girlfriend and her daughters needs and wants above my own. It's a very hard mix becuase I do love them but we aren't married. And if we broke up I would have no right to ever see her daughter again. 

It's extremely tough to find a balance. "
"I can't for the life of me understand why you would start a relationship with someone who smokes if it's a ""deal-breaker"".  "
"I have difficult parents and it's a challenge.

The thing is, you want to have this conversation with them so that they can acknowledge that they were wrong and do better in the future.

Your wife knows better.  She knows that this conversation will never, not in a million years, turn out that way.  She knows that what will actually happen is her parents will double down on their complaints, justify their negative behavior and refuse to accept any responsibility for anything.  Far from resolving this situation between you and them, it will actually make it a thousand times worse.

See.  She's their daughter and she's made a choice not to remove them from her life because despite their behavior she loves them.  You hold no such attachments.  

She's scared you'll get more pissed with them and cause problems with her maintaining a relationship with them in the future.  She knows they're unreasonable and you can't reason with someone who is unreasonable."
[removed]
"Yeah, he needs to be very firm and maybe add a bit of shame, ""Why do you keep touching me?"" but a lot of people think that adults have the right to touch kids. Reacting too strongly will actually be counterproductive."
"Quit trying to defend her. She cheated on her boyfriend in whatever measure and then went back to the other guy for comfort while he was left on his own. That is not a good person. Nobody would do that to someone they cared about. The correct thing to do would be to either recognize she was catching feelings and cut the other guy off from the get go or tell bf and break up with him. 

Just because she is guided by emotions and this that and the other doesn't excuse her shitty behavior and she very well may have messed this guy up for a while. I know I had trust issues for a good long while after I was cheated on. Nobody deserves that."
"Why?

Why are you putting up with the lazy, rude, dirty, cheating, drama llama?

Seriously, if you had friends they would be having an intervention to get you out of this mess.  You need some serious therapy for being vulnerable enough to stay this long.  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!"
Unless it's a one party consent state and then you don't have to disclose if you are party in the conversation. 
"The above is great, I'll add in that I was your daughter's age and these things might also help:

* I was so glad it happened. My mother was a very toxic person. Don't be surprised if your kids are relieved, **or** carry resentment about one or both of you because your marriage made their lives as kids shitty. 

* Don't get rid of shared memories/items until the kids say so, even if it means storing it. There was furniture I was attached to, Christmas ornaments, photos, etc. Just because it brings bad memories to you doesn't mean it does for them. 

* It will be unsettling for the kids to see you struggle a bit to get your shit together. 

* Wear condoms/get snipped. Don't give your kids a ""miracle"" half sibling. I literally told my dad that no matter what his dates say, wear a fucking condom because I didn't want a half sibling. 

Good luck."
"Also listen to your gut! We don't know this guy, you do. So if he's giving off the vibe that he's rushing into things to sort of lock you down, or starts being weird and controlling in other ways pay attention to those things. We have seen time and time again where older men seek out younger women who aren't experience in dating as a way to sort of mold them into what they want. Just be observant and keep your bullshit meter with batteries in it. "
"So to summarise :

- you were looking after your sisters kids

- you went against her parenting decisions 

- now you are confused as to why she's upset


Have you apologised instead of rationalising your behaviour? Havr you accepted responsibility? 

If you are too lazy to look after your niece/nephew then say that when she asks you to look after them instead of undermining her as a parent. "
"&gt;  if she's not careful she'll pass those issues on to the kids

Sounds like she's making damn certain she passes them onto her kids."
"Shit, she can have mine. Lol"
"Yeah, ages are right. Not a typo. I thought the daughter was from another father, but mom corrected that thought."
"This is all very strange. He's entitled to have his hobbies and it's great that he's such a movie buff.  But you're not, and that's okay too. I don't really understand his logic in forcing you to be a movie buff too. That's not really how it works, nor is it a reasonable request. 

Is it typical behaviour for him to ""act out"" when he does not get his way? 

It's almost as if he thinks that, unless you value his love for movies, he doesn't have much else to offer. Would you agree with this? If so, what can you do to make him feel valued in other ways?"
"My thoughts exactly. This has to be a troll post. If not, I feel so fucking bad for this chick's husband. "
"This should be higher up. I suffer with anxiety. It makes me miserable and controlling and convinced that my plan is the only plan that will work. And it fools me into thinking that if I can just have complete control, that everything will be fine. So I am on Prozac. And far more pleasant.

She still responds to her acute anxiety by controlling. She doesn't realize that marrying you won't actually make her feel better. Next, it will be buying the perfect house, making babies, raising your kids in whatever manner she thinks will mitigate the anxiety. And her anxiety isn't going anywhere."
"&gt; You've already lived through divorce once successfully so I have to imagine this is an issue of how you're being seen by society?

I agree and I know it must be hard for OP to understand this at the moment, but just from this one line: 

&gt; He is currently texting me a barrage of shit about how the failure of my first marriage was my fault, too, and that I deserved to be hit by my first husband.  

People are going to say, ""She's made the correct decision twice now""."
"Great response, I hope OP takes this one to heart."
"Everyone is saying you shouldn't snoop but this is your wife of five years not your girlfriend and she's acting weird and not communicating with you and you've barely seen her because you work insane hours. I'd love to know what kind of voodoo mind reading these people would want you to do. So, you've snooped and have info so what do you do with it? Counseling. This isn't about you she's just blaming you because it's easier. She needs help it isn't normal to sit around in a filthy house with dog shit on the carpet or to be unable to hold down a job longer than a month. That's insane! She needs therapy."
"""he called me a slut""  that's all I had to read to know he's a bad boyfriend  
Edit: read the rest. So your bf just watches you get molested and does nothing? Wow. Here's what you do. Send him one text ""it's over""  then delete his number, block his number, delete him off social media, block his accounts, and don't contact him because you can easily do much better. "
"My boyfriend and I have the same height difference. He said he likes it because ""I don't make his neck hurt""

He also likes it when I wear heels when we go out because it's easier to hear me talk 

OP: don't let anyone make you feel insecure about your height. Embrace it!!"
"Firstly, the case at hand. He has brought an illogical fear of yours to the surface - through behaviour that sounds a lot like ""negging"". Since you doubt yourself, I think it will help if you start to look for external clues about what the reality is. 

So here's a quick exercise: get a piece of paper and divide it into two columns. In the first column, write down a short description of your style and list a few other people who have a similar style to you (they may be co-workers, they may be models, it may even be the brands) and what you think about them. Next, in the same column, write down all the evidence to support the fact that you look nice and professional. Write down all the people who say so and write a brief assessment of them (eg do you trust their judgment, are they professional, are they sane). List as many compliments or approving looks as you can remember.

Finally, in the other column, write down this guy's name and a description of the clothes *he* wore.

Then weigh the two columns against each other. Ask yourself what it would mean if someone like him thought you looked good - it would probably mean you looked like you were wearing ill fitting clothes from the early 90s, right? Basically if he ever says ""you look great"" you'll know you've really messed up!

Your fear about seeming inferior to this guy is not based in reality. He pushed your buttons and made you feel so fixated on pleasing him that you forgot to notice that pleasing him isn't your goal. Whenever you find yourself doubting that, pull out your list and take a look.

Secondly, the bigger issue. It worries me that you put up with a workplace bully acting inappropriately to you for so long. His behaviour was incredibly creepy and offensive, and it has had a lasting effect on you. You need to take steps to make sure it never happens again - find out about how to spot bullying and harassment, and how to deal with it effectively. For this I would suggest maybe reading a few books on workplace bullying (I'd also suggest The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense, which is an old but good one).

I wouldn't be surprised if you have trouble setting and maintaining boundaries in other aspects of your life, too. A therapist might be able to help you with this, but even just becoming a bit more aware of it yourself will be a good start.

"
"You can put OP up without putting her down.

Little hypocritical of you to call her a monster whilst vilifying her for also having her own preferences. "
"My dad is 6'4"", my mother is 5'1"". I'm comfortably in the middle zone 5'9""

She would joke that she put a bucket on his head and swung from the handle. "
How did you not see this before you got married?
"&gt; My wife does not considerate it cheating because the relationship is female/female,

LMFAO.  The person cheating doesn't get to choose what is cheating.. and what is not cheating.  If you are not 100% OK with this.. she's in the wrong and needs to figure it out.
"
"&gt; Do not give an inch on this issue.

Yeah. I think there's an argument that somewhat more than an hour of screen time per day is fine (not unlimited, but more than one hour). However, given how ugly this fight has gotten, I wouldn't even open that door. If OP's husband wants to do research and see what actual time limits research suggests are reasonable, that's fine. Until then, OP's should stick to her one hour rule. "
"I drive a 10 year old pickup truck. I have money and could afford to drive in a luxury vehicle, but I don't because it's a depreciating asset and that money is much better served growing in an investment account so I can own a home, travel, and retire someday. 

You can still indulge a love for cars in cheaper ways (car shows, taking an auto mechanic class, etc.). "
"I'm a landlord and you can easily be an annoying asshole within legal rights. 

As soon as rent is late you can send notices and file for court as soon as legally possible.

You can not renew their lease if given notice.

You can exercise your right to do inspections of the property and appliances with notice.

After the dog is there it could make noise, resulting in noise complaints, which starts the paper trail showing that the tenant is a nuisance to other tenants.

While none of that stuff is that bad, I wouldn't want to live somewhere where I know I have no wiggle room and the management doesn't like me."
"Also, your therapist will not care if you lied before. They aren't judging you. They are there to help you. You are literally paying them to help you. You weren't lying, your point of view has changed. That makes a huge difference, OP."
[removed]
"Leaving someone you love when they're bad for you is one of the hardest things we have to do as adults. Giving up on hope is harrrd. 

I suggest you get into personal therapy. Not couples counseling, just you. Pose questions about what kind of life you want for yourself, what kind of partner you want. Then start thinking about what you need to put in place to get it. One step at a time. "
"&gt; I'm not even sure how to address this with her since she seems to just shut down so quickly if the discussion isn't going her way. It just gets to a point where anything said that may be potentially negative towards her is 'insulting' and she 'shouldn't have to live like that'.

^^ That does not in any way, shape, or form sound like a relationship that was ""on solid ground."""
Exactly. He's living the good life. Why anyone would want to change is beyond me.
"On the behalf of 26 year olds and younger everywhere, it's downright insulting that you're insinuating that OP's sister would choose vacation over family in distress due to her age and not due to her outstanding lack of moral fiber."
"Call your parents. Call the police.

Take pictures of your face and nicoles text messages. Save them in an additional place than your phone."
"Unfortunately, OP, I think you're being a bit overly dramatic and have unrealistic expectations for her. She is very young, a good amount younger than you, and is (rightly, in my opinion) trying to work on her professional qualifications to set herself up for long-term success with a career she enjoys and can excel at.

It doesn't mean as you say that she 'doesn't really care for your relationship', it probably just means she is realistic and grounded about the fact that it wouldn't be very responsible to forego important training and career advancement opportunities *right now*. Doing so could leave her somewhat stunted professionally which would make a big difference in her ability to support herself and have a stable career over the course of her professional life. 

I do feel that if she was more committed to the relationship, the nature of your conversations would probably be about how to make a LDR work and what a long-term plan would be for her to get the professional development she needs and for you to be together ultimately. On that note, it is fair for you to have a candid conversation but steer clear of guilting her or presenting absolute statements like you do here. Simply say you want to know whether she sees a future with you and if so, how she is thinking you'd reach that future together given her career needs. If she says she doesn't, it probably is best to break up. If she does but you aren't up for the LDR thing, it is probably best to break up. "
"Compromising on whether or not to get married in the next *several years* does, in fact, lead to resentment. Not sure what you're getting at here. Obviously there are compromises WITHIN a marriage, but there should be no major compromises ABOUT a marriage and its foundations.

Seriously, I'm not sure what my marital status has to do with this, it's basic logic. OP really, *really* wants to get married and has already waited longer than she wanted to. Thus, if she waited *even longer*, she would be resentful. OP's boyfriend seems to really NOT want to get married, and if he were to give in and marry several years sooner than he wanted to, he would be resentful. So I'm not really seeing what is wrong about my statement here."
"Second this OP.  Get Ron's ex to screen grab all the messages and file for an RO.  Tell her (and then do it, go with her to the police if you can) that you'll back up her story of what Ron was saying about her to others.

Also if it's not already clear, you should dump Ron and get away from him.  Guys who do stuff like this are unstable: it's only a matter of time before you end up receiving the same treatment."
As a parent this is making me so fucking sad. You're spot on that the parents feel like they need their whole family together regardless of whether the daughters want to be together and I COMPLETELY get it. I cannot imagine going through this
You are supposed to feel a very deep emotional connection. Are you even capable of something like that? 
"I got tired of a guy at my job a few years ago throwing his trash ""for fun"" into my car.

I put condoms over his wiper blades. His mirrors, his turn signal indicator, and his shifter.

He told me he didn't even notice until he went to grab the shifter.

No more pranks from him since.

Good times."
"&gt; So you get to splurge on whatever jewelry you want, but he has to save for the wedding? That $5k could go a long way to a wedding (think venue + food for 100 guests), and you didn't even let him know that you had the money but were spending it on yourself.

We hadn't seriously talked about saving up for the wedding. So I didn't know I was supposed to be saving, because he clearly wasn't saving.

No, I really don't think he was saving up for the jewelry. I suggested that I wanted it as a graduation gift and he avoided it."
"Is this about smelly trash? Or is it about how hard it is to deal with your father being so sick he needs adult diapers?

If it's about smelly trash then how long are diapers being left in it before being taken out? Is there a better way to seal them up so the smell doesn't build?

In other words, rather than lecture your brother about how he should feel or act, model grown up behavior by troubleshooting the problem with him. 

If it were me, each soiled item would be put in it's own bag and sealed up. I'd also take out the dirty items to the outside can asap instead of leaving them in a trash can in the house for hours. 
"
"If you'd rather do drugs than be with your girlfriend, you don't deserve to have your girlfriend. Point. Blank. Period. Find another drug addicted girlfriend to enjoy cocaine if it's that important to you. Otherwise, buck up and be a responsible adult."
That's your opinion. And a pretty shitty opinion to hold about someone you claim to love.
"&gt; The problem is, we will go for weeks in a blissful, loving, passionate relationship and then out of the blue, he continues to bring up the dinner with Anthony and subsequently ""punishes"" me in the form of verbal attacks.

I don't know why you've kept John around enough long enough for the wedding to be an issue.  He's not going to get past this.  He's not interested in trying to get past this, no matter what he claims in his calmer moments, or the cycle wouldn't keep repeating.  Stop punishing yourself and call it quits already."
That's is so incredibly gross. How would you feel if you found out some random guy was jacking it to your Facebook pics? Your BF is that guy.  
"Forget scheduling. Buy him a good set of head phones and an adaptor to plug into the amp. He will love your thoughtful gift and you get the gift of silence. 

Edit: I just saw where you said it is an acoustic. Get him one of those insert things that cancels the noise a bit. I don't know what they are called. They basically plug the hole."
"He's the one looking at it though? 

Also he might want to know he looks fat clean shaven.

Most married people I know want to be attractive to their SO"
"Call the police and stop being so passive. Everytime he pulls something you go for it. If he tried to stop me, I would have locked myself in the bathroom, called the police immediately and told them he was keeping me hostage and explain the situation. They will escort you out, watch you get your stuff, and help you get a restraining order. 

Once you are out, you HAVE TO GO no contact and keep all info about where you are and how to contact you secret."
"While you have a point and 10.000 is a lot of money for most people... the way you phrase it and your reaction is a bit strange. You pointed out that it's her fault but honestly, shit happens. Most people have done something stupid once while driving, like not seeing a stop sign and be lucky enough to be the only person in the area at this moment. Unless she did something completely irresponsible like driving while wasted or she is always having accidents, you shouldn't be that hard on her. And yelling at her for something that she didn't do on purpose is useless. Hopefully the kids weren't at home at this point. You have every right to be upset and make her find a way to pay for everything on her own. The thing is, anger and acting aggressively is never justified. Yes it's hard, but it's money. You shouldn't have to waste it, but again, shit happens. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but if you know that you have anger issues, you need to fix it no matter how justified your anger might be. And there's nothing we could say to help you work it out, you need to see a specialist."
She's made it pretty clear that she does do that.  She's currently doing way more housework than that because of her fiance's refusal to pick up after himself.
"This would make anyone extremely uncomfortable. It's pretty fucked up that you're being emotionally blackmailed about a basic human function. How are you supposed to form a long term serious attachment  and build a life with someone who almost has a meltdown when you take a piss? 

How are you EVER going to feel comfortable around someone like that? This goes way beyond ""walking on eggshells"" and the more I think about it, the worse it becomes. This is not a odd quirk. This is not cute or funny. This is deeply concerning on a fundamental level.

This needs to be resolved immediately or you need to bounce. He's either got some sort of neurotic phobia or he's the one of the most immature and irrational people on this planet. Either way, that information you need to know NOW."
"Nobody thought you were intentionally and maliciously strutting him around the apartment or making out in the common area, but if John has advanced beyond the concrete operational stage of cognitive development, the point still stands. "
"I would push farther on this issue. I wouldn't be okay dating someone who acts so weird about the bathroom. Try communicating with him be assertive and call him or on his past behavior. Push the issue if he says ""it's just weird"" keep pushing and say ""no it's not, I'm a human being who needs to relieve myself. It's not normal to be so bothered by someone using your restroom so why are you getting so bothered by this"" if he refuses to give any answer TBH I wouldn't keep dating him because this isn't a sustainable behavior long term. It's not like you're ever going to stop needing to use the restroom so he needs to come to terms with this. Is it OCD related? Is he heavily in denial that girls use the bathroom? Is he embarrassed by the state of his bathroom? What is it? If he won't identify and work on that then there's no point in continuing the relationship. "
"The one thing that gets her hooked is that she thinks the possessiveness is romantic. She doesn't express it in quite so many words but she sort of brags about it and treats it like a good sign. I want her to see that that is his insecurities.. not romance. But that one is hard to convey.

I do try to ask her if she is happy though. So far she has been saying yes.."
"&gt; They could have been somebody who knows OP's daughter, found it because they were looking at escort services and wanted the family to know so they could help her.

Okay...so why didn't the contact the daughter and tell her she should consider being more discreet for her own safety? Why did they go to the father of a grown woman and say ""hey, your daughter's a sex worker?""  Why didn't they contact the father and say ""I'm seeing that your daughter is going through some stuff, how can I help,"" without needing to specify the way they've been hearing?

I mean, it's basically just not OP's business, at all, and it's creepily paternalistic for someone to think that it is."
"No, the point is that he called her shallow when she told him how it made her feel to get afterthought flowers. This is not about expectations, this is about respect."
"Holy shit girl, get away from this abusive piece of shit. 


You have literally described a relationship I was in for 3 years. It culminated in him raping me, and it nearly destroyed me. "
"When the death happened it was at Adams moms apartment. The son &amp; mom split the rent and Alyssa pretty much lived there as well. Alyssa left her truck there and all her stuff when it happened and since it was a crime scene. She recently was able to get her stuff. She discovered someone had broke into her truck, cracked the window shield, went through all the stuff in the dashboard, threw trash around. She had a blanket in there someone put in mud. I mean who the does that? I was heated. It was probably some of adams family... "
"""I felt like I got hit my a freight train. I couldn't breathe but when I came around, I saw my boyfriend scrambling off me."" And that sounds like a full body slam with no mention of the ball so who knows if he touched it first. We can't actually know exactly aggressive her bf was being so I can't keep arguing."
"Imagine, for a moment, that you ask your doctor why you're so energetic and can't concentrate at all. The doctor checks you out and says, ""You have ADHD, take this pill."" (Not how it actually happens, but I'm trying to demonstrate why this is bad.)

Then a friend says to you, ""Hey, I'm energetic and can't concentrate, do you know what's up?""

Instead of telling them to ask a professional, you say, ""Oh, you must have ADHD. Take this pill.""

Two months later, you're doing better in life. You're not so fidgety, you can concentrate, and everything is great. The same two months later, your friend has an amphetamine addiction because you decided you were a professional when you're not.

Now let's pretend you're the doctor instead. You find out that your patient has been claiming to be a doctor, and their family who are also your patients are supporting this."
Drop him like the douche he is..
"Moving out might not be an immediate option. Seems like they're in a house by the way it's described. OP left out the most critical bit of information - do they rent or own, and who is on the lease or note?"
"Right? It's perfectly okay to respect someone else's values without sharing them. If she feels compelled to enforce her values on her roommate, then she needs to find a roommate that shares her values.

I think OP can politely tell the roommate to fuck off - that while she is happy to ensure that their shared space is comfortable, it's her home as well."
She wants all the attention to herself.  She is a queen bee and you stole a drone.
"&gt;He said that I just wanted to make his mom feel guilty

This one is especially egregious.  The other two are just your run-of-the-mill conflict avoidance where the husband knows his mother's in the wrong but doesn't want to escalate the issue.  This is siding with his mother *over* his wife and using emotional manipulation to try to make his wife relent.

God forbid the MIL's ideas of raising children go against OP's.  Wonder what kind of tricks her husband would pull out to try to keep OP from doing anything about that.  "
"Do you go to a religious school or something? I went to a hyper liberal undergrad and I'm not sure I heard a single person talk about wanting babies when I was there. A lot of discussion about booze, coffee houses, and getting laid, but uh, not so much babies. "
"""Even for your taste""...he's saying that he expects you to be okay with these jokes. If you're not, tell him!"
[removed]
No!  This is horrible advice.  The mother will lock her down even more.  Do not tell her!
Gum chewing is an actual deal breaker for me. 
"I'm very sorry I don't have any advice other than to ignore her but not do anything to piss her off, and to try and keep anything party-like on the DL. And also be careful with molly of course, you don't wanna end up in the hospital or dead or anything, not only because your mom would explode but because, you know, dying isn't a great scenario for you either. I'd just keep working hard at college and at your job until you can move out and if things get too crazy, ask to crash with a friend or something for a little while"
Probably because she wrecked hers already.
[removed]
"It could be something that's so obvious everyone misses thinking about it: what if OP's man has lost flexibility, gained weight, or a combination of the two? 

If he's perfectly fit with this issue, I'd lean more towards bringing up seeing a doctor. 

If he's at all overweight and/or mainly sits in front of a computer all the time for work, he may just not be as able to fully reach around back there to clean. If this is the case I'd recommend some butt hair trimming (OP can help!), some stretching exercises, maybe some baby wipes kept by the toilet for those squat &amp; gos, and a rinse down in the shower after involved poops. 

I'm sure he would rather take ANY of the above steps as opposed to knowing his wife has to wash poop stained sheets on the reg. "
"wait. so you're taking out your anger on someone because someone else rejected you? hold the phone, because what the fuck, man. "
"Also! Fuck his comment about teachers. To be honest the most influential person in my life was my high-school science teacher. Without her encouragement, patience, and understanding I would never have pushed myself the way I do. Or learned to value myself the way I do. Literally her presence in my life was one of the few things that kept me ALIVE when I was struggling with severe mental health issues exacerbated by a terrible home life. 

Teachers are some of the most important people in society. And what your husband is doing is projecting his own insecurities onto teachers. Rather than accepting his poor learning skills he probably chose to blame teachers. 

He sounds like such a classic narcissist. "
"I'm sorry--this sounds like a dangerous path. If he is already nervous about healthcare in his country, and his parents put this much pressure on him already, I can only imagine this could open a very dangerous can of worms. At the very least, it could lead to him being pressured into unneeded tests or procedures, only to be exposed for the lies. I can't imagine his parents would react well at all.

I know OP is in a desperate situation, but this could make things much worse."
"Your wife is abusive, full stop. 

Also ""guys should love overweight girls""? What the actual hell? Would you expect her to be attracted to you if you gained 50 lbs? Humans are generally attracted to people within a healthy weight range - that doesn't make you anti-feminist. Body positivity is great but the ""body positivity movement"" is total bullshit and actively denies science. 

If it were just the body positivity thing, it might be something you could wait around and see if it blew over. But she is violent several times a week and threatens you with bodily harm. Dude.. is this really what you want for your life? "
"yeah! i dont think it's unreasonable for a therapist to say ""maybe she is anxious about _______"" and husband to be like ""SHE SAYS YOU HAVE ANXIETY"""
hr. Hr. HHHH RRRRR. EYYYYYYCHHHH AAAAAARRRRRR
"I'm not a lawyer, but I believe your husband is correct when he says you can't throw him out.  Otherwise, abusive partners could just throw out or constantly threaten to throw out their victims, or landlords could put their tenets out on the street without notice.  There is a legal process to remove/evict someone from the place they have been living that allows them enough time to find new accommodations. 


I would suggest speaking to a family lawyer about your options.  Your bankruptcy lawyer has said you shouldn't file for divorce yet, but that doesn't mean you can't prepare for divorce or legal separation in the meantime.  As another poster said, if you are concerned about your safety your can file a restraining order, this is another thing you can discuss with a family lawyer to see if there will be any consequences later to the divorce.  

edit: spelling"
"I had this once.  Just stop giving excuses as to why you cant go, and CERTAINLY dont give a maybe.

""Do you want to come to a music festival in Sunday?""

Then pleasantly reapond with: ""No thanks :)""

People might wait a bit in silence waiting for a reason why not.  It might feel rude and unnatural, but it isn't.  There is no obligation to go and there is no reason you should hang with someone you don't want to.  Keep this up and offer no explanations as to why you are saying no.

She will stop, beleive me.  Train her you will say no to EVERYTHING. Dont entice her by saying ""maybe""."
"Agreed, MIL is crazy. Your response would work well with a  
 -reasonable- person. "
"YES!! ""Just being honest"" is a fig leaf for ""I have a really offensive opinion and will preemptively shut you down for calling it that"". Nope, nope, nope. So disrespectful."
I'd be mortified every time I ran into her.  I wouldn't be able to live it down even though it wasn't my lie. It would become mine by association. 
"We'd eat about 100k if we sold our house. It takes several years for real estate values to catch up with the cost of building.

We could rent it out and make a profit, especially during the summer. That's why selling it doesn't make sense.

I agree that it's not an easy problem to fix, but the onus has been entirely on me. That's not fair either."
"&gt; You can start by asking your mom what she sees for your future.

Oh! Oh! I wanna play!

OP is going to stay home, being a good, devout Christian girl, helping out around the house and volunteering at church, until Mommy can find a nice, good Christian man for her to marry. After that she is to be under her new ~~owner's~~ husband's control, being a good, devout Christian housewife and ~~baby incubator~~ mother until she fucking withers and dies.

OP, please have the conversation and tell me how far off I was."
"Not a boyfriend, more like consistent FWB?  He thinks it's out of control.  They didn't speak for months last year when she blew up the first time.  He has tried to talk to her and her husband about how strange this behavior is.  The husband doesn't take it seriously either, because it's so effed up."
So he hangs marriage over you like a carrot but won't give you the necessary information about himself to form a healthy marriage? Nope. Move on.
There a popular picture meme on the internet of a girl that gets sent to me once every few months asking if that's me. Even had my husband fooled. Dopplegangers man. Dopplegangers.

"&gt;""you need to respect your elders"" from my husband.

""I don't know about 'need'. But I believe everyone *should* be treated with respect. Including myself. If your mother can't treat me with respect, I'll respect her from a distance."" "
Yeah being cruel to a 13 year old boy about being adopted is so attractive and not at all an indicator that that guy is a immature ass in other areas of his life. Ridiculous a girl didn't want to stay around for that! 
"I think you're being unreasonable. 

At the extra $70k over 20 years, the most you could be talking to is $70 a week. If you've calculated with interest savings, you might be talking to closer to $50. 

In having a friend rent from you directly, you're saving in property management fees, as well as any advertising costs or costs for time spent vacant. But you also have the peace of mind that someone is taking good care of your investment. Between the two, I think this could be worthwhile. Just my two cents. 

EDIT: Also, it's unlikely in 20 years you'll still be renting to this same friend., so it's probably not reasonable to calculate for such a long period. "
"I've been in your situation before.  You don't have to be angry about tonight. But you can be angry about the pattern. 


Here's what you need to do: Reclaim your time back - you need to respect your time even if he doesn't.  This will show you if he'll start to respect you and your time, or if he's not the right guy for you. 


Make solid plans with him just one day a week - sat or sunday.  And keep any other day for yourself or if you're free, then you'll might up.  See if he can honor that one day.  Then, see if you want to add a second day.  

--------------------------
In my case, my Ex couldn't even commit to one day a week, and wanted to be ok cancelling if his friends wanted to meet up. I was pissed.  So, I said, no more planned dates, and he was really happy.  He assumed that I would be at home waiting for his calls.  For the first three times he called me to meet up, I was busy each night (even if I stayed at home watching tv).  He finally figured out that he had to give me advance notice to respect me and my time.    We broke up because his lack of respect for me showed up in other areas, and I didn't want to train him.


Good luck"
"Couple quick questions:

In the 2 years you two were 'together' before this, have you ever tried to ""surprise"" him with lingerie or sexy outfits before? 

I'm guessing the two of you have had sex prior to getting married. I'm hoping the sex was OK, but is there anything... peculiar or particular about the sex?  


I'm also assuming you look just fine in a micro-kini, and will pass on asking for pictures. 

This dude might have a serious case of Madonna-Whore complex going, where it's OK for you to be a sexual, attractive woman *in private* but in public he thinks of you as this virtuous, pure woman. Seeing you as a sex object *in public* would have caused those two images to collide at full speed. That stuff is 100% therapist work, *for him*. 

EDITED TO ADD: while I'm thinking about it, let's talk really quickly about fantasies and reality. Lots of dudes have fantasies; they look at swimsuit models or porn and it's all really quite... stylized? Unrealistic fantasy? I absolutely applaud you for trying to make one of his fantasies come to life! That's a wonderful thing to try, and I don't want to quash that urge. **BUT**, fantasies are sometimes fantasies because they're not tied to reality. Not every fantasy *works* in reality. Sometimes the appeal of fantasies is that they *aren't* real. So while I'm 100% behind the desire to make your partner's fantasies become real, I think the next time (with this partner or a different one) it's important to *talk to your partner first*. Say things like ""how would you feel if *I* dressed like that swimsuit model?"" and see if we're talking about a fantasy that could feel real in a positive sense, or if it's something that appeals in part because it's disconnected from reality.

"Low self esteem is a horrible thing.  The only thing that trumps it is high self esteem.  That is built through building *you*.  Quit dating.  You are OK without a man.  But you have to believe that.  Build something on your own.  You go a year without dating and can manage to be happy, then maybe you are ready to make better choices in men.  You need to get to the point where you are able to look for the man you want, rather than needing the man you have."
"I'm also Indian (in an interracial relationship):

Your boyfriend is an asshole for not telling his sister off at dinner. There is no ""cultural reason"" for you to be treated like this. "
"Personally I'd dump that person and depending on how I felt may even sue them for the vet bills/medication.  

While it may be an accident he ignored your wishes and treated the dogs as his own.  He didn't care for them as if they were yours.   

I have two dogs too so I know how pissed off you must be. "
Would you like a lollipop? People are different.
"I don't think that is necessary.  As fancyfreecb said, it's most likely the parents who want to have their family together during this tough time.  I still think it's important to let OP's sister know he doesn't mind but I don't think OP should pressure his parents into not caring just because he doesn't mind.  "
"It's all there in the OP.

Sorry, but if you're having to be reminded to take basic, routine safety measures after 3 years, that really means you don't care to, not that you're forgetting to."
"Whatever happens, vaccinate the kids."
"&gt;Believe me I'd love to find a girl who also enjoys video games, sports, being active and spending time with friends as much as I do

This is the lowest bar ever. Most of the women I know like all of these things. I'm a little skeptical at your ""I've met a lot of women in my life"" statement. Honestly, it sounds like you might look down on women a little and that's why you're not attracting any independent ones. A smart independent woman would stay far away from someone who thinks all women have limited interests. 

Yes, relationships require some compromise. Maybe you'll play sports together but she doesn't want to spend a lot of time playing video games. That's fine.  But no one should make you feel like you have to cut off pieces of yourself to fit together, or require you there at all times to keep her entertained.

"Baby steps.

Next time someone knocks on the door, open it."
So blow off your family and just do his. It feels amazing to give yourself permission to do what you want for the holidays. 
He punishes her emotionally for stepping outside the bounds of his control... That is abuse. 
"If you actually don't believe in traditional gender roles then why is that such a ""major red flag""?"
"But it really isn't his family, is it? It's you and your kid from a previous marriage, your ex husband and his kids, the kids your stepdaughter had..and then your fiance. The family set-up entirely revolves around your connection to your ex and his children, that's the family, your current fiance likely feels like an outsider and I can't really blame him. Even the house he lives in is entirely yours, he hands over money to you like a dependent.

It sounds like he's having a hard time being a part of a big family that you already established with another man. Obviously you're going to be close with your kid and your child needs to come first and I doubt that'd be an issue to him, but he has gotten like this since you've fallen back into the role of wife/mommy to these people that have nothing to do with him. You're entirely right, it's like he has become a housemate, and that's not entirely his fault. You can have a life and be active in many ways, and you can be on good terms with those people without going to this extent. Him being good friends with your ex-husband in no way implies he couldn't be jealous of the dynamic you have going. He's your fiance, after your own child he should be coming first.

I don't think more blackmail or you v.s me is going to help. Your kid is one thing, expecting him to pretend to be family with your ex husband and his children is entirely another, and in all honesty I'd tell you I want no part of it in his shoes. Instead, tell your husband how you feel about him, assure him you still care about him, do some things as a couple and re-ignite that spark.

"
But you didn't break his trust - you did not cheat on him. He never redefined your relationship so whether he trusts you or not has nothing to do with you joining tinder. The fact he is still somehow making this about you 'supposedly' cheating is concerning. What is also concerning is you are accepting a level of responsibility for his feeling of betrayal. 
"Duh.

Children who don't have the chance to form attachment with a parent/caregiver, will act like that.  Ask any foster parent.

He needs time to feel secure and relax and be a child.  Butt out."
"Have you thought of going to couples counseling to help re-frame your relationship? 

If you're absolutely set in divorcing, then consult a divorce attorney first."
"It's completely fair to dump someone if you're not attracted to them. That's a big part of a relationship.

That being said, ANY girl you date is gonna want to take off her makeup and put on some frumpy, cozy clothes sometimes. You can't expect someone to dress up for you every day."
So what happened when he saw your rearranged room?
"&gt;I pretty much said that I would only live there if I could have a single room

And now they think you're going to change your mind, I guess? That was your condition for moving in there. If they had similar requirements, why didn't they speak up before now?"
It was her idea for me to do a lot more with childcare with the idea that we were becoming a family. 
"He is doing this to hurt you. She needs to know that. Will she listen to it, though? Maybe. "
"I agree.

&gt;Of course this is all after the time she spends despising you for trying to tear her apart from her one and only true love.

Par for the course with a lot of people in very early adulthood."
"Yeah, they need to buy a new matress."
"Thanks for clarifying, you sound like a good person who deserves a better friend. Good luck."
"I notice you keep defending yourself against ""being emotional"" when in fact you are the one who is not being emotional.  He is, by popping the balloon in anger, destroying or discarding toys in anger, basically upsetting the child being punished as part of the punishment.

Emotional upset can come as a result of the punishment, but it's not the point of punishment.  This is emotional sadism, unfortunately a very common kind."
"What, why would you speak to her parents? You are both grown married adults. "
"Take a look at a book called ""The Sky is Falling"" by Raeanne Dumont. It's about phobias and OCD, but it describes a lot about what's going on with people suffering from hoarding and other things. You mentioned you ""froze"" when going to clean your room. That reminded me of some of the things these people deal with. OCD doesn't mean you're going to be obsessed with cleaning things and it can be the opposite and having an overwhelming feeling when faced with whatever it is that bothers you. Also, don't try to do things alone. Recruit a close pal to help even if it's just talking about how you feel about the situation. In a lot of situations, sometimes people just need a friend and it's okay to ask for help. "
"&gt;  I really don't see him as a violent person

You STILL, today, don't see him as a dangerous stalker even though you know he is still actively stalking this woman, and has been doing so for *seven years*; so why would you think you could correctly identify him as a violent person in time to stop him from hurting her?

I don't know what you're protecting yourself from by refusing to see this situation as Very Bad.  Your friend is a stalker.  You condone his behaviour by remaining friends with him when you know he's still stalking.  You attempt to excuse and soften his behaviour when you say things like:

&gt; I acknowledge the possibility [of violence]...

&gt;  I don't think she's quite as scared as everyone assumes... I don't know.

&gt; what seemed like a heartfelt apology...

&gt; I think it's a little extreme to assign this name to him...

It's all wishy-washy, half-committed thoughts that don't come off as sincere in the least.  It means nothing.

&gt; ... because that would make me not much better than ""Elliott.""

Is that what you're worried about?  Being ""better"" than Elliott is a really fucking low bar at this point.  He is a stalker.  You are really good, close, long-time friends with a stalker.  You are protecting your stalker friend-- and your own status quo-- because it's easier and more comfortable.  Better is subjective.

If you want to help your friend, go to the authorities.  He's proven that he cannot stop stalking her on his own.  Get him real help before he escalates even further."
"My biased, and humble opinion is that he's doing that ""just friends"" thing where he slowly begins dating another girl as he lets your relationship fall apart. It may not even be that he likes her a whole lot more than you, he simply doesn't want to settle down and is going to chase positive attention wherever he can get it.

I personally would put a boundary up and see how he responds."

"You can be addicted to many things. Some of those things are not naturally addictive, but your body can be conditioned to react to them as if they were."
I'm not sure why he would feel intimidated by you since I assume he is still taller than you even when you have heels on.  Does he hang around anyone who is even close to his height? The only thing I can think of is that he's lived most of his life being significantly taller than every person he's met so when a taller person comes along and makes themselves comparable to his height with heels he just doesn't know how to feel because it's something so new. 
Ladies with dwarfism deserve better partners than this asshole. The problem with men who need to feel superior to women is that they do it by making women feel inferior. 
"&gt; often when women are in these situations that's the sort of harmful thought process they go through: 'He's a good guy, he's never hit me or anything'

...which then can escalate to “He’s a good guy, he’s only hit me once” and then “He’s a good guy, he only hits me when he’s drunk and is very sorry afterward” and then..."
"""It's just not working anymore; we're over. How soon can you be moved out?"" Don't ask him to move out; ask him when he's moving out. From now on all conversations should treat his eventual departure as a foregone conclusion. That's kind of a general life tip - step one of ""how do you get someone to do something"" is to have conversations that take it as given that they'll do it. (That's probably how he moved in with you in the first place.)"
"I really want to know what actually happened between your father and his colleague 2 years ago.

"So much this. $700 a month total towards vehicles is beyond insanity when you are 10,000 in the hole and have no savings. BF is nowhere near ready or mature enough to get married.

Yes the race women will have to be the first one to get the furthest away from your toxic attitudes. 
"Reverse the roles for a second and see how it feels.

Say you did something iffy and your BF called you out on it. Most of us (decent people who care about our SO's feelings) would apologize. Even if you justified your actions and your BF was mollified enough to let it go...if he came back and said ""I've been thinking about this more and it still bothers me""...
Would you be even more angry? Or would you be like ""damn, I feel like a jerk- this is something that's really bothering someone I care about""?

I've had some on-the-edge-of-abuse situations in dating and turning the tables almost always clarifies who is in the wrong. You should be able to talk about things that feel uncomfortable with a partner who cares enough to listen openly. Your bf sounds like a jerk."
"It's ultimatum time.  Him or you, and make it clear that if she does pick him, the kids will pick you."
"I think he MORE than made up for what he said.  And his actions have truly shown he's sorry.  His actions are also showing you that he is honestly just tired from switching to night shift.

I think you need to just let it go.  Distract yourself when the thought comes to your mind."

"There's no point:  she simply tell him what he wants to hear.

And once she's had a kid, she'll do what she wanted to do from the beginning and there's nothing the OP will be able to do about it.

"As a former alcoholic who's been friends with lots of clean and using addicts: OP, what your guy has been doing is ~~almost~~ textbook for someone who's gone back to using drugs. The stuff he says he's doing for/with his friend doesn't make sense, and in your heart you probably know that.

In addition to getting him to take a urine test, I recommend that you go to NarAnon or AlAnon. You'll get tons of support and information there that will help you make decisions going forward. The format of the meetings might seem odd to you at first, but go to at least three and preferably six meetings before you decide it's not for you. 

Good luck. Loving an addict is painful. Tying your life to one is a nightmare.

"
Yep no doubt. Sounds like a mid life crisis.
"OP listen to this. You do NOT date a single parent if you think it's unfortunate they have children. A single parent will be a package deal. You can't have just them and not the children. And if they're willing to give up their children for you, they're not a good person.

Dating a single dad is hard. It's challenging and sometimes confusing. But it's par for the course. You accept it all or you don't do it. There's no middle ground. A stepparent role is a HUGE deal. And you have to take it seriously. Because the children don't deserve any less.

"I'm going to be honest and it's probably going to earn me some abuse here. If my wife was so upset that she was smashing dishes and tossing stuff around I would step in. If her actions were a clear and present danger to either of us I would step in without a second thought. 

Specifically, and I'm trying to view this situation through the lens of the person who's side of the story we don't get, I get home. Late. I'm pissed off because I was walking out the door 4 hours ago and got called back in. My phone died and I didn't get a chance to charge it. I know she's gonna be mad so I come in the door already apologizing. 

""Well I don't think you're really sorry."" 

I stop. I am right on edge and I don't want to say anything. She's right to be upset, so I take a second to cool down and manage to hold my tongue. 

For some reason this upsets her even more. 

I approach the table and sit down to eat. Suddenly she's clearing everything off the table and throwing out perfectly good food. I'm willing to let this to, I'm starving but again I don't want to get into it, up until she starts violently throwing the clean plates in the sink. 

I run over and put my hands over hers. Honey, please stop. You're going to hurt yourself. You're going to break something. She ignores me, she just keeps doing what she's doing. I retreat. From the living room I can hear her continuing to smash and crash and bang things as she ""washes dishes"". I'm now getting angry at this. It feels like an attack. 

She comes in the room and I call her on it. Again I'm ignored. She goes to just sit on the couch and continue being quietly angry. I put my feet up on her side and insist that we have to talk about this. Finally she relents. We're getting somewhere. Then she sits down beside me. 

But I don't want her there. I'm worked up. I'm just as upset as she is. I stand up because I don't want to be close to her right now. I tell her to just stop trying to move up on me. Stop jumping around. 

""Don't you **dare** tell me what to do."" 

I try to tell her that wasn't what I was trying to do, but the damage is done. What's worse, she determined that my attempt to stand up and retreat, to put some much needed space between us, was an attempt to intimidate her. 

----

Now I wasn't there. This is just how I visualized this. I could be all wrong. I just always try to remember that we're only getting one side of the story. "
"Unfortunately this is so common (boys building up ideas of what their real father's are like and then being dissapointed) it's a common trope in media now. Fresh prince of  bel air had an episode that was really emotional. Basically, there's a reason he wasn't in your life until now. Good men, no matter the circumstances would have made an effort to be in your life. Relationship with your mother non withstanding. "
"That is excellent insight, Thank you. "
"She's 27 years old and acts like a high schooler. If I was you, I would say good riddance. It's beyond exhausting to try to be friends with people who are that passive aggressive. Does not make for healthy friendships. "
"&gt; This is unfair. She's obviously NOT a spoiled brat in general, from OP's description. She worked, saved money, did well in school full-time, and went and got the exact job she wanted

On one hand, you're definitely right. It's not like her rich parents just gifted her a couple million bucks and she wasted it away until she had to work a normal job. On the other hand, getting a 6figure bonus from a *nanny* job is.. not common, and probably not *that* much in relation to her actual work load. Now don't get me wrong, being a nanny can be exhausting, especially if maybe the parents are difficult people(or the kids or even both), I've worked in a kindergarten myself. Getting a job travelling the world as a nanny and getting that huge of a payout on top of it is.. not just common, but unimaginably lucky, though. Like ""0.1% of people get such an opportunity"" lucky. And that's something she's gotta realize.

You can be hardworking and still spoiled, and it seems this applies in this scenario. What she earned was incredibly disproportionate to her actual field of work. How many students do you know that don't have to work, can graduate debt-free, do luxury things like getting her nails done at a saloon and *still* contribute to the household on top of that? Do you have any idea how many people can afford to just *not* go working for **6 years**? While getting a complete education including a masters?"

1) go find some other dessert that fills the hole of cookies that they are okay with

2) stop being with them.

Fyi if your relationship doesnt normally include huge gaps in taste and self-acknowledgement, and choosing the ring is still more important than it, then don't be together IMHO   "
"Saying ""I'm not *unhappy*, I'm just dissatisfied, frustrated and feeling trapped in a life that I no longer feel like I want and I constantly long to be doing other things in other places"" is kind of redundant. 

You're not ""sad"", you're unsatisfied.

The point of life is not to feel ecstatically happy all day long, because that's unobtainable. The point of life is to feel satisfied and content as much as you can.

You're 31. You've got a lot of life ahead of you. Whatever the reason, you've reached a point where what you have now and what you have planned isn't what you want anymore.

Whether it's the hormone thing or not really doesn't matter. It's not what you want.

Staying in a relationship because ""It isn't bad, it just isn't what I want"" is a *terrible* idea.

Imagine if you found out that your finacée felt this way about you. Would you be thinking ""I'm glad he's decided to marry me and spend the rest of his life with me, even though he doesn't find me attractive, doesn't want to have sex with me and dreams of having our home to himself""?

Would it not be a better idea to break things off and go and seek someone who you can have adventures with, and let him find someone that is passionate about him, rather than doom the pair of you to spend the rest of your lives in a relationship that is merely adequate?"
This is the best suggestion that i read on the thread.

"This girl just lost her dad and her boyfriend was away for 9 months. Plus she was honest. If that's not a reason to forgive someone then holy fuck you must think of yourself as absolutely perfect (not directed at OP, more towards anyone suggesting that he just dump her). 

Personally, given all that's been going on in her life right now, I'd be inclined to try to make it work. But, OP, that depends on if you honestly think you can do it. No one is going to fault for you leaving someone who cheated on you. 

My advice - Don't make any rushed decisions. Take the time to both be by yourself and be around her and see how it feels after some time has passed. You've been away for awhile, even if you do choose to forgive her, you might find that you're both in totally different places right now. What if you tried taking it slow and dating her again? I think eventually your heart will tell you what you need to do. "
"Sexting when you explicitly told him to stop is reason to break up with him.  If he can't control himself to not send a text, how well do you think he can control himself in other aspects of life?  He's blatantly disrespectful to your wishes.

"Fellow PhD student here. My supervisor would never ask me to do something like this.

You need that time at the break to network. I would point that out. ""I'm happy to plug your book wherever I can, but there are some people that I really need to speak to tomorrow.""

He probably hasn't thought about it because senior academics (particularly male ones, sorry) are often not hugely clued in to the way the supervisor/student relationship works today. "
You don't think it's inappropriate that her teachers are asking about him in a way that makes her uncomfortable?
Seriously? You don't know who Pol Pot is? Or Jeffrey Dahmer? Do you even know who Eva Braun is? He's not calling you that because you can be direct sometimes.  And if you can be direct sometimes why haven't you directly told him to cut the shit out?
"5 months in and you've taken out a loan together? BOTH of you arent right. id guess she is a codependent who is ready, willing and able to be a prison wife. and you are someone that is willing to move forward with a relationship even at a cost to the other person. idk. this is so weird "
"""Awful"" is a bit hyperbolic. Dude bought the kid a toy cause the kid wanted it. . . 

A lot of people when they live together or get serious do expect some help to raise the kid. I have had boundary issues in relationships before where I allowed the kid to do something and the mother did not want it done. Most of them handle it well and just tell me ""hey, in the future lets try not to do X"", you pull some shit like ""it's not your kid"" or ""you aren't his/her parent"" and that's a cord to never try again IMO. 

Point is, I think she is overreacting a bit but he does need to respect her wishes. "
"He's just super lazy. Relationships are give and take no matter how much you work. Yeah he might work more then you, but he should still be ""chipping"" in in terms of house work. I used to work 40-60 a week and still found time to make supper every night as well as do the dishes and take care of packing lunches for the following day. I would also vacuum every 3 days. It wasn't much, but it's what I was able to do.

No matter how you dice it, you shouldn't be responsible for ALL the cleaning. That's bullshit."
"Was she happy? 

OP, it may actually be that you're unfortunately not compatible with your wife. If she wasn't happy with the previous sytem and that system was the only thing that works for you, you either need to compromise or the two of you aren't a good match. "
"No, I think, at least the ones I read, were giving reason to his feelings behind his behavior, probably because she said she had no idea why he was doing it. But they still were telling her no way should he be doing that. Reason is not excusing. 

Now that OP had made more comments about her husband, his temper and abusive tendencies are coming to light and his behavior is likely an extension of that with the grief being the reason for his feelings, not his behavior. 

I haven't read all the comments, though, so I very well could have missed one saying she needed to be sympathetic, and I'm not defending those comments whatsoever. "
"On the flipside, if sucks to have a partner who thinks they know better than you what should or shouldn't be a dealbreaker for you and takes the decision out of your hands by lying about information that might cause you to reevaluate the relationship. "

"Honestly I have no idea how it must feel to be in your situation. At the same time though, 10 years is still a lot of time to pursue what you want to do. I really think having someone to talk to like a therapist or psychologist about your feelings and how to handle them more positively could be really good for you.

If you want to go for a relationship then you should go for it. It's always better to have tried and felt than to have never tried and felt at all imo. I reckon just being upfront with your date before becoming serious would be the best way to go."

I'm a guy in a long distance relationship, so I'm going to call out your argument of the driving force of reproduction as a valid reason for utter lack of control just complete bullshit. 

So at this point, I have no other choice to be blunt with you. Your friend made a bad choice that defined her and you are going to have to learn to accept that. You also have presented yourself to have a poor judgement of character by how far you are willing to grasp at straws to defend your friend.

"You need to start putting your foot down. As of now you've just let him think this is pretty much fine for the last 5 years. ( I cannot believe you've put up with this so long.) You need to sit him down and explain that this has nothing to do with him and everything to do with you needing perfectly healthy and reasonable alone time. If he starts getting offended tell him to stop making it about him. Tell him that all your asking for is a little space, which is perfectly healthy in a relationship.

He also needs to understand that what he is doing is not healthy. 

I would actually suggest that you go to a couple's counseling appointment to bring this up because he will likely use the excuse that all his friends are like this too! You need a neutral 3rd party to be with you to enforce that what he is doing is not healthy, while simultaneously enforcing that you wanting that time to yourself is perfectly healthy.

You really need to schedule some time for yourself at least once a week and then put your foot down and take it for yourself. And don't let him make you feel guilty about it either. You are your own individual human being entitled to not have a bf hanging off of you 24/7. Frankly it's off-putting and weird, especially for a couple in their early 30s. 

ETA: the fact that you don't want him to cone home and you are walking on eggshells are a couple of really good indicators that you are checking out of the relationship btw. I don't blame you at all. This relationship sounds exhausting. If he doesn't respond to couple's counseling or want to fix the issue (or if he denies there is an issue at all) the relationship is over. At that point it would be obvious to me that what he really values is his comfort and doesn't really care about yours as long as he's getting what he wants"
"I'm saying this to help you, not to be mean: your insecurity is going to ruin your life. It's not going to stop without your intervention. From what you have described, this Julie chick sounds like she doesn't have malicious intentions. 

I was insanely jealous and insecure before. I was always negative and would focus on the flaws of my bfs (female) friends' personalities. Not too healthy, right? The gym really helped me, along with learning a new hobby. I know it's cliche and generic, but you need to find something that makes you remember that there's a reason why Adam is spending his life intimately with you and not Julie. It's way easier said than done, but I hope you do find your peace! "

"Of course where the money comes from is important. But when we budgeted for school, with his full support and encouragment, we allocated that money for school. So although we dont have that money, it is now invested in my education. And the money is not the issue here. That is one aspect I have always worked with him on and compromised. 

And I am not sure what else I could say for you to understand how I feel disrespected by what he said. Perhaps you just dont feel what he said is disrespectful. But it does sound like you two may get along well. "

"Actually, I don't know if I would call it selfish of her to issue an ultimatum. 

If marriage with him is what she wants, but she's not willing to wait any longer for it, I think she was in the right for clearly communicating that to him. It's possible that she didn't issue it to pressure him into marrying her, but rather to let him know that that's the timeline she is willing to operate on, and he can either shit or get off the pot.

Granted, from the OP it kind of sounds like she has been dictating the progress of the relationship since day one. And personally, I think her timeline is unreasonable (provided there's no external factors we're unaware of), but that's neither here nor there. She's put the possibility of breaking up on the table, so she shouldn't be blindsided if it actually happens."
"because you could just as easily have gone back to sleep by saying to the ex ""No, that's not right. you can stay, but it has to be on the couch."" 


Seriously, I can't believe I've only seen one person in this thread say something similar. Your excuse just...isn't one at all. Saying it was a lapse in judgement is *generous* . Imagine if the roles were reversed and it were your gf in your shoes and she gave that same bs ""excuse"". I mean it. Really and truly try to imagine walking in to find her in bed with her ex and envision your reaction to her saying she let him do it because she was too sleepy to say no. The grandfather being the hospital isn't relevant to the ex being in bed with you whatsoever, so obtaining proof of that is pretty worthless at this point. Your shit story just doesn't add up at all, and I hope she finds someone who's capable of setting boundaries. Jesus."

"I really wonder about the safety of the mother, too, though. If she's the bio mom of all those kids, that means she became a mother at 20 with a husband 18 years old than her. She's likely been with this abusive, (very possibly towards her as well) significantly older man her entire adult life. Just seems like a bad situation all around."
You can't bring a baby into this toxic relationship. 
"Two ways:

1. Raise issue with parents, this maybe the high road but you're an adult, so it might indicate that you're a push over.

2. Stand up for yourself. ""Listen here you brat. This is *my* home. You're a guest, and as part of this *home*, you're subject to a series of expectations. One of which is respect. You want to live here, play by the rules. If you want to start shit, I've got 3 years over you; and unquestionably, I can come up with better ways to make your life hell over mine.""

If that starts shit with your brother, fire right back. Then involve your parents. 

4X Strategy: Explore, Expand, Exploit and should the situation demand it, Exterminate. 

She's impeding on your life choice as well as your family's personal space."
"&gt;  I wish she would accept an open relationship...

The marriage is already half open anyway.  Her definition of cheating needing to be opposite gender is utter and complete bullshit and it's a justification/excuse she's using to convince herself that it's OK for her to be with someone else sexually and require that you be faithful to her.   I'd bet a bunch that if you ""came out"" as bisexual and said that you are going to start having sex with a new guy friend, that she'd freak out. "
"This actually says a lot about how he handles conflict. Maybe he realized he forgot the soap and was embarrassed when you pointed it out, so he petulantly responded ""you didn't TELL me to"" to cover it, which is a really crappy way to act. Another possibility is he legit doesn't understand laundry or see things that are in front of his face, and in that case he needs to be willing to learn if he's gonna cohabit with you. Believe me, this stuff does not change in a relationship unless the dude wants to get better at it - how many of your friends' parents have the dynamic of lazy ass man and woman who cleans up after him?"
"One thing I might do would be to tell your roommate that you're not sure who did it, so you're going to the police, because that person has nudes of you, and the police officer you ""talked"" to said that that is enough information for them to trace it back to whoever did the catfish.

You don't actually have to go to the police, but it might scare the crap out of your roommate enough to either confess something, or delete the nudes he has of you. 

I'm not sure what else you can say to him. For now, I might just avoid him, and act as if everything is okay if I'm forced to interact with him, until I can move out of there. I'm so sorry this happened to you."
I'm surprised you trust him not to let the cat disappear outside or something. Has he at least fixed the door by now?
"This right here!

Yes many kids grow up neglected and develop a sense of how to act but not all do.  I think your brother is in the latter category. That doesn't make his actions right, but I think it is far more complicated than him just being ""entitled"".

I do think you have gone above and beyond in helping your brother.  Having him to live with your other brother would probably be best move right now.
What does he plan to do once he is 18?

"You never found the full details of the affair. So you never healed. In other words, you rugswept her affair away which is the biggest mistake you can make in this situation. 

It could be residual effects of cancer like people are saying or people in affairs keep piking up fights with their SO's as to demonize them and justify the affairs. Or  combination of both(her cancer and affair).

Who was the guy she was having the affair with ?  You just let them get away with it. You should have atleast told his gf."
"You don't get HER... find someone that you will get and that gets you.

Think of it this way, she has saved you lots of time and effort. Move on, she just wasn't feeling it and you didn't know her well enough to notice.

Or she only figured stuff out afterwards. Regardless its pointless to try hack out the details and figure out whats up with her.

Move on."
No!  This is the worst advice possible in this situation
"You need to tell him. Hiding it won't make it look good. He will end up knowing at some point anyways.


Then about the 28 vs 19. I think this is mostly your loss if you go on with it. There is a good chance you loose your friend who might not be happy about his 19 year old sister dating a 28 year old. Then there is the issue that she is not at the same stage of life as you are. If you want to settle down and have a family, she might not be ready for that for a long time. During that long time she will grow up and not be the same person she is now. That has a good chance of her leaving you when she knows what she wants. Then you will be much older and finding a partner becomes trickier business."

"Wow. This speaks to either a massive insecurity on his part, heightened possessiveness, or a puritanical streak. Like you, I've been involved in fandom since my early teens, and I'm a grown and accomplished adult now who still writes. I've known other people who have set boundaries on their fannishness with their partners, but the lines have made sense: no RP, for instance.

Your SO is making extremely false equivalencies. Either he doesn't understand what fanfiction is, and how it's a multi-faceted endeavour beyond writing sex - not that that's porn or cheating - or he doesn't want to. Personally, I'm writing a story right now that yes, has sex in it, but also has politics and revolution and a distressing amount of historical research into post-Napoleonic France under the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy. I'm a PhD student and I've spent my time off doing archival research into printing presses and pamphlet wars between 1816 and 1848. Want to know about Montagnard secret societies? Police spy networks in 19th century France? The rise of cartoon satire in that period?  Silk worker strikes in Lyon? The art of lithograph? Divisions and advances in medical practice in 19th century France? It has nothing to do with my own research period, but I'm fannish about Les Miserables, and I'm passionate, and writing fanfic in which dudes in cravats bang to the sound of grapeshot is an act of creativity and love that brings me joy in my downtime. I'm a lesbian; this isn't sexual in the same way my personal life is. There's a line between sex in the head and the sex I have with my body. One is impersonal and the other is not. If a partner wanted me to stop writing in the way that's made me happy since I was a young teen, they would have to drop that demand or be dropped.

If you were a romance novelist, if that was your job - would that be cheating? It's the same thing, and I bet romance novelists' husbands don't regard their partners' work as cheating."
"''She mentions that she spends money and time on him and his family ''

Ok cool.Did he force her or something i do not get why you mention this.

''is off-put by his reluctance to even go 50/50 on an account because he doubts it'll last and sees no benefit.'' 

 No the guy saying something most people would,we are too young not engaged/married and there is no benefit in opening a common bank account.

'' so much as the gesture of unity and confidence in their relationship lasting,''

 Sounds a great relationship,having to re-assure you love your GF by being guilt tripped into having a joint bank account,very romantic re-assurance lol.

''but if she does care about the money, it's because she thinks your relationship is financially one-sided and wants you to contribute.''

 Aum all her arguments were how she spends money on him and his family by HER OWN WILL!!!How is that one sided??She does things she likes,or is she doing them to ''buy'' his ''reassurance''?


OP doing the right choice given their situation."
"By not ending it you are making him stay with someone that's repulsed by him, and not giving him the chance to meet someone that craves his touch. That is unbelievably selfish. "

1. We know nothing about their finances and 
2. it sounds like she has a home office and therefore a job.

"I'm sorry, I must have missed something.

How she spends *her money* is your business how exactly?

That she bought something she wanted, and that she likes, with her own money makes you upset because... why? 

&gt;I thought it'll give us things to do rather than just talk to each other for hours on the phone

So, talking to her on the phone is not fun for you? You don't like talking to her on the phone? 

&gt;In my opinion this just means that she doesn't care at all about my opinion or spending time w me.

Right now, she **has** to visit to play games with you, and you're unhappy she didn't get a system that would let her **not** visit you and play games together? It's it nicer if she's, you know, physically there with you?

If she asks you your opinion, then makes a different decision, that doesn't mean she doesn't care about your opinion, it just means *your opinion isn't the only or most important thing to her*. And you know what? That's OK. If you think your opinion should be her law, then you've got bigger problems than gaming systems, sport."
"If you're taking over duties that she's currently paying someone else to do, then it is a fair enough point that you should owe her a bit less than you would be had you been moving in and she was childless."
So how come you aren't spending your money on the switch to spend time with her?  
"Yes, but refusing to escalate this as necessary is asking for them to keep trespassing. You know how people say that insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result? You need to start being realistic here. This crazy lady with her shit parenting is *never* going to listen to your kind requests. Read back over this and put someone else in your shoes, change the situation up a bit. She had some children over to *your backyard* for a birthday party! Who even does that?! 

Inform her that you are absolutely going to call the cops on her if you see her on your property again (especially since you *already* have cameras backing this up). Have your lawyer draft up a cease-and-desist letter documenting this. This step will help protect you. Hopefully that threat will be enough to scare her off. If it isn't, you need to be prepared to follow through.

If you *do* catch her or her kids (in person or via camera) on your property again, *follow through* and call the police non-emergency line. Report a trespassing situation. It's seriously not a big deal at all; my workplace (a bookstore) has to trespass customers every month or so for thefts. The cops **will not** mind at all, it's not a hassle, and *it's what they're there for*. The police are there to uphold the law. Your neighbor is not only *repeatedly* breaking the law, she's throwing it in your face at the same time! Keep repeating this.

It's okay to have anxiety. It's okay to be uncomfortable about this. But you need to protect your property, your pets, and your assets from injury and liability. Doing anything less than that as a homeowner/pet owner is just foolish."

"I think the most hurtful part of it was that she was fully aware of what I had been through and the extent of his cyberstalking--after I continued to block him when he would make up new profiles and message me, he friended someone I knew from high school and then stole all her pictures to make a copycat profile and added me, just to try to get access to me. I figured it out because the profile had like five friends, and none of them were mutual. 

To find out--after all of that--that someone I considered a friend was sending him screenshots all the time was so devastating.  I found out who it was after she admitted it to a mutual friend.

It makes it hard to trust people, unfortunately."
"As someone who is marrying a foreigner with visa issues, and is around your age... I don't think you have any idea what you're getting into. Not just relationship-wise; but if you're having problems in your relationship now, as your post history indicates, the stress of the immigration and spousal sponsorship (or whatever your country's equivalent is) is going to wreak havoc on your relationship and lives in general. My fiancé and I have been dealing with this for *years*, it is insane. I'm not saying you two for sure won't work out, but I think you need to take a long, hard look at everything you're going to be going through -- it's not all sunshine and roses; the immigration processes, weddings, etc. they're all potentially super stressful events. Add in the family and relationship issues you're having, and it's going to be *incredibly difficult*, not least of all because you don't have a solid support system. 

And as for your boyfriend's immigration status? I'd contact an immigration lawyer; expensive, but worth it. More often than not, there's another option besides ""get married or go home"". "

If you continue to cancel plans on people, you are gonna lose your friends. And that won't be their fault, it'll be 100% your fault.

"You go about this situation by dealing with the actual issue: your insecurity and anxiety. Do you have a reason not to trust her? It's normal for folks to have friends of the opposite sex, including single people. Especially in your early 20s. And in a healthy relationship, you should be able to trust your partner. Sorry man, this is your issue, not hers. "
"If he acts like a kid, treat him like one. When he does anything like that immediately look him in the eye and say ""Stop doing that. I don't like that.""

But really, the point where I'm treating my boyfriend like I'm his mom is the the point where I realize we're not a good fit."
"I guess I'm not doing a good enough job painting the picture of what's been happening.

He is spending his days - from 7am to 10,11pm, with another woman on campus. Brittany has mentioned how uncomfortable she is with all this, and how she feels abandoned.

It's awful to see, because I AM seeing Bob flirt with Alice, practically cuddle on the couch, share intimate secrets about their fights with their SOs.... it just feels wrong. If Bob was my SO, I'd be crushed.

"would you consider that more of a universal boundary? or is it a personal boundary for you?

I have received massages (that i pay for) from a woman i also met through work (friend of a current coworker, and former employee of the restaurant i work). The situation there did not cause any disagreement or even bring up a discussion about boundaries.

Frankly, i can accept that his personal boundaries are different, but  bringing it up the way he did last night makes me feel as though he does not respect my opinion or decision about it. I would understand that more if i crossed a universal boundary. 

"
"Personally, I think you are being unreasonable in your boundaries and he didn't do anything bad. You can be your man's best friend, but you don't own him and you can't be his only friend. His ex told him he's a bad listener and she also cheated. Maybe he's understood she was missing something and he wants to improve himself so you're not also missing it. I think that's pretty commendable from a self-improvement standpoint. Who better to get some dating feedback from than someone you dated? 

But you should definitely not get married yet. You clearly have some things to talk about before you agree to forever. "
I don't get the point of this post. He understands that. Everybody understands that. He's looking for options on how to deal with this practically.

"this is so weird! i had a friend that did this exact same thing; she was super insistent on bearing the label of ""mom friend"" (she still is from what i've seen, though we don't talk anymore). this was a symptom of her otherwise super controlling and patronizing mentality. as the ""mom friend"" she felt like it was her place to tell her friends what to do in their lives as though the very label made her wiser and more mature than she was. i think she clung to that idea of being the person who everyone turns to as an authority figure, one they also love and respect deeply like family.

unfortunately for her it just isn't reality. it's just a symptom of her endless insecurities. i think maybe your friend is the same way."
"I have 3 kids and found that it was actually cheaper to hire a full time sitter/nanny than it was to pay for daycare.  We have had both college aged students and moms who are looking to supplement their family's income as employees.

We've never had trouble finding good employees and the flexibility that we get over daycare is awesome.  Maybe something to explore."

"I've been in this exact position. I was best friends with a girl for close to eight years before I realized my feelings for her. Same thing as you guys, we touched and held hands all the time cuddled up while watching movies and such. Even went as far as sleeping in each others bed together from time to time.

Early one summer she invited me to be her date to her mothers wedding. At the wedding the same type of thing happened, her distant family kept asking if we were together. After the wedding that night we were driving home, and she got quiet. I looked over and she had fell asleep all bundled up wearing my jacket. Something about that night and seeing her all wrapped up in my jacket peacefully sleeping made it all click for me. I truly loved this girl.

Fast forward a couple of months, and I called her up and told her I couldn't stand it any longer and I had something I needed to talk to her about. We met up for dinner, and I just went for it; I told her everything I felt. To my surprise she told me she had the same type of feelings and that she was too scared to say anything. She didn't want to ruin our relationship if I didn't feel the same.

We dated for 3.5 years, best years of my life. Although we had a ton of fun while officially dating we ended up deciding we worked better as friends then anything more. 

Here we are, a year and a half after we broke up. We still hang out all the time. Just now her new boyfriend comes along as well, and we all get along great together. Its nice not having mixed emotions in-between us, and constantly wondering what if. 

Knowing what I know now, would I change anything at all? Absolutely not. I know If I never said anything, it would have just kept eating away at me. Then If she found a boyfriend I know I personally would have envied their relationship and it would have ultimately destroyed our friendship. 

So man, do what you think is right. But take it from a guy who has been in that exact spot, its worth taking the chance now. Because we both know not knowing what would have/could have been is going to kill you inside."

"You are not trying to measure up to an experience from some badly planned trip. You are the girlfriend. He is not dating Elle. He's dating you. She's one of the buddies that had his back once. You are the one who has his heart now. If you try to make him to limit contact with his close friends, he'll get more distant from you. I don't think he sees her in a sexual way, she's a trusted friend who didn't let him die and he didn't let her die. It's good to keep people who don't let you die around. Try to see her in that way. Maybe try to imagine it was you in your boyfriends spot. Wouldn't you want Elle to be your friend forever, despite not being sexually attracted to her?"
Gonna need an update on this!
"As soon as I saw he was a nurse, this was my first thought as well."
"I think there are some initial steps you can try first. And while *she* hasn't earned respect/civility, it can make things go more smoothly. 

Sorry this is super long, I have a bit of personal stake in these types of issues! 

I think she is likely hooked on that feeling of 'being helpful' and 'being respected'. And so she's not acknowledging her lack of qualifications. I get why you are angry. As someone who works in medical research and does online/in person education/support stuff, and who goes out of their way to communicate that I am *not* a doctor/their doctor, I know what you mean about the legal issues and the frustratingness of it all. I never try to give 'do x get y' advice, particularly for those I don't personally know. I've worked in medical research for about 8 years now, that doesn't make me someone's doctor, and I make that very clear (my main focus is sharing medical information/research in layman's terms, with references). It's always 'research shows this' or 'these are questions you can ask your doctor'. My background helps me be aware of how little I know and I always acknowledge that--it could be easy otherwise for me to feel overinflated from the thanks and questions I get. 

But I've seen people get seriously addicted to a feeling of 'being helpful'. And they just don't realize/acknowledge the consequences of inappropriate medical advice. They don't think of legal consequences or mortal consequences for those they 'help'. 

I've seen similar shenanigans and it's crazy how shortsighted they can be. In one case, in a QA setting, a woman was talking like she was a medical expert and gave the impression she was a nurse. But a lot of her terminology was inappropriate/contradicting. And she seemed far to eager to give personal medical advice. A woman asked a question, including a mention that doctor said they 'could not x'. The pseudo-nurse (not understanding the terminology of the doctor's instructions) gave very 'medical sounding' advice that *directly* contradicted the woman's doctor. The pseudo-nurse very obviously was not familiar with the drug treatment and thought the two treatments were different. If the woman had taken her seriously, she may have pushed for a treatment that might have killed her. 

It's hard not to get angry when you see people giving dangerous advice. Even helpful advice should be stated in general, non-exclusive terms (because no one online is anyone's patient).

 I think it could be helpful to try to approach *why* it's a bad idea, rather than the betrayal or cheating of it. You can't 'prove' that SIL is unqualified, as she has convinced herself that qualifications aren't relevant. So focus on consequences. E.g., she can never know a 'fan' as a patient, and thus can't know if there are physiological contraindications to advice that she gives. But if they *trust* her, based on her front, they might just follow her advice. And that can lead to serious harm. If that happens, not only does she have the moral consequences of her inappropriate advice, she would also face possible legal consequences for misrepresentating herself. 

As you yourself are aware, medical professionals do not give personal advice to non-patients. Even the most qualified doctor can't give medical advice to someone they aren't treating. Because medicine is complicated, and individual background *matters*. But a lot of lay people aren't aware of this. Desperate people are especially vulnerable, such as those who are chronically ill or struggle with weight. They are eager to trust and try things. As someone eager to share advice, it is *her* responsibility to communicate how qualifications matter and be upfront about her own. **Otherwise, she is misleading people because it is more important for her to feel praised/respected/helpful than to *actually* help others**. 

Maybe give it a shot to talk to her about appropriate ways to share nutrition info. Sharing research, bringing attention to studies, maybe even pursuing proper certification. Because it's unfair to those that trust her, to do otherwise.

Have similar conversations with the family. They support her because they don't understand the risks. And if you are focusing on your personal injury, that is what they will assume it's about. If she doesn't respond to the appeal to consequences, I think you should report her, but I would honestly try other routes first. Because Facebook won't care about her qualifications, and those who will care *will* have legal consequences. And even if that's best, it will make family difficult. If you can try another approach first, or get the family to help you, it would be better. Sort out your feelings after the danger is handled.

"I dont think you being goofy is the problem here. You just need to be more aware of where and when being goofy is appropriate. You said that you being a generally happy positive guy was what attracted her to you, so completely ridding yourself of this goofy/fun trait wouldn't help.

And you do have to understand, maybe she feels annoyed because she thinks you dont take things seriously, and just like to goof around in life, ignoring real life problems. 

So basically, there's a time and place to be goofy, learn to figure it out. "
"I think I would argue that a guy who has never made his wife orgasm before realiy, really, really should not be having threesomes "
I guess ultimately even if I do think it's strange it's not worth fighting over if it makes her happy. 
"&gt; Your husband is deciding that his mother's comfort is more important than the dog's health and that is not okay.

THIS PART IS REALLY IMPORTANT. Particularly when you consider--rightly!--that this foreshadows any parenting disputes. She thinks she is doing a nice thing to make him like her, spoiling the dog the way a grandma ""should,"" when in reality she is hurting him."

"&gt; Should I let her pay if she asks, or is it still more polite to pay?

Offer to pay. But if she insists on splitting the bill, then let her.

&gt; I’ve been reticent to tell people for fear it’s one of those big warning signs that women talk about in dating.

It's a bit of a heavy topic for a first date. Don't bring it up unless she asks why your relationship ended.

&gt; I have breath mints, a pressed outfit, nice shoes and had my hair cut. I honestly don’t know what else I would need to do to prepare.

This is so cute! :) Good for you, man.

&gt; Should I be doing something different or not at all?

If things go well, call or text her the next day to tell her you had a good time. Don't wait too long to make contact again."
"Staying in this relationship is a horrible idea. If she wants to sleep with someone else (her ex of all people? Seriously?) and you are not okay with that, you will end up very hurt if she follows through. Break up and tell her she can go fuck her ex now if she wants. Remove her from your social media, block her, stop talking to her so she can't beg to get back together. If she gets suicidal, you can contact her friends/family about it and get them to handle it. "
"Agreed! Surprised I hadn't seen this mentioned yet! As someone who's had a person invent sexual encounters involving me it was so distressing and disgusting to have my agency taken away and to have to ""prove"" or argue that I never knew him in that way. Please don't overlook this component. I understand where everyone is coming from with 'it's a silly lie told out of insecurity"", but I bet that's no comfort to Leah. She shouldn't have to defend herself against this. He's fabricated a whole physical and emotional history that she did not consent to. "
"It's good that she's working on her mental health. She isn't being passive in dealing with her mental illness and that's good.

That being said, it's time to have a ""come to Jesus"" talk with your gf about her friendship. This guy is not a friend to your relationship whatsoever. He doesn't respect you or your role as her boyfriend. Make it clear that you're not comfortable with her friendship with this guy and that something needs to change. Remember, that change may need to come from you by leaving the relationship. I would not recommend staying in this relationship if your gf can't set up boundaries with this friend. "
"If she is already 34, just be prepared for her to potentially rush the relationship a bit. i would try to find out her timeline for starting a family. If you guys date 4 years before getting married, she will already be 38. Fertility issues may or may not come into play. You guys are both old enough to have this conversation and decide if your timelines are going to be compatible. Best not to waste either one of your time."
"Yes! I get where he's coming from because we do have these arguments all the time, and I sympathize because I can see the frustration, I just don't know how to express to him ""I'm listening to you"" without being defensive though."
"Ahahaha, I forgot about that!"
"Don't waste your life being sad. You only have one life and it can be whatever you want it to be. I know it would be painful to let go of your marriage, but think of the life you could have with someone who really appreciates you, or on your own free from these pressures. "
"Do you think telling him would fix him?

Because here is an example of your problem; he's trained you to believe that everything that's wrong in your marriage is your fault and therefore your responsibility to fix. But that's not true; you can't fix what's wrong because you can't do a thing to change him.

It is totally out of your control.

You can't change him. There is NOTHING you can do to fix this."
What would you tell a girl friend or sister who had a boyfriend who acted like this? 
Thank you thank you :) 
"Why in the world is she showing you random dick pics. Lol. 

Look, her sad little posse of exes is okay with this behaviour. She probably gets off the jealousy and attention. Don't join their gang but break free from her circle completely. You're doing yourself no favours hanging around with drama llama who only wants attention."
"In my city at least, it feels like meetup is suuuuper group oriented, that's the only reason I suggested a more one-on-one type thing :)"
"This is kind of bad advice.  If OP leaves and doesn't tell his mom where he's going, she can call the cops on him for running away and he could get put in jail for that.  He needs to get CPS involved."
"What you're describing is a lack of respect in his thoughts/feelings towards you, which is made manifest by the way he treats you. That's still really bad! 

You're the best judge of whether this can be fixed, but a solid predictor is what the majority of your relationship is like. If this is a one-off, go to therapy. But since you call it a ""vibe"", I'd say that there isn't much here to salvage."
"Can you go to someone else's house? Is there another activity you can do that doesn't involve tv, like games? "
"Honestly, it's probably the overwhelm. The more people respond the more I'm wondering"
"Seriously, OP, what about her is the same person you fell in love with five years ago? 

It sounds like she's undergone major personal changes, which you're not on board with. You can't expect her to just stop one day and go back to the person she was. It doesn't work that way. "
"I know you have a gym routine and all that, but can't you go to the gym with her a couple times just for fun? Or maybe she'll take it seriously. 

The point is your girlfriend wants to spend time with you and do something new with you that you two haven't done before together. That's something that builds relationships. 

You don't have to work out with her every single time you go to the gym, but it wouldn't hurt to do a couples work out once in a while. "
"I think you're being obtuse really. 

There was no need to contact her dad. They contact her! 


I was literally ""economically forced"" into prostitution but it wouldn't make it right for someone to expose something like that to my parents. If they're worried about me they can contact me or fuck off. She's not a child. She's not underage. She's an adult. "
She didn't learn anything if he pays for the lesson.
Can't she get it retroactively?

"I screwed this up with my wife.

I dated a girl very briefly. Then broke up and we became friends. A year later I started dating my wife. My wife and this girl became friends. After a few months I told my wife.

She was furious and rightly so. I learned my lesson. You tell your partner if you are around an ex."
"Eh, them making a grown woman give them her work schedule (per another comment of OPs), and driving by to see if and when she's home, is beyond empty nest syndrome. It's also beyond bizarre.

I'm an only child and had to wean my mom off from texting me so much when I went away to college, but while my parents have always been somewhat protective, they've never actively stalked me. "
Bisexuals represent :D 
"No, not if she has myopia (near-sightedness).  It's fairly normal for vision to get worse from puberty until about 25 then stabilize until about 40.  It's frustrating to get new glasses all the time, but it isn't unheard of.

At least, this is what my eye doctor has been telling me for ten years."
"You've only known him for a month. I personally think your expectations are unreasonable, and a bit clingy, but if you are looking for someone who responds right away even during the first month, then maybe this isn't the guy for you. "
"I wonder if you're actually having more of a trauma reaction to being sexually assaulted by O than to the bullshit from your ex. Obviously the bullshit was at a really bad time for you and compunded what you were feeling. But you froze and had the ""out of body"" trauma reaction  before that part even happened. 

Your ex is great at making everything all about him and looking for attention. But maybe this isn't about him, he's just vampired up your attention, when your attention needs to be on yourself, and recovering from the assault and feeling safe in your body."
"You do realise that he expects you to give up your career to have children,  right?"
That was pretty harsh. He didn't say that anybody owed him anything. He was asking for help getting through it. No need to kick a guy while he's down.

"In my family we ""just got money for doing nothing"". If it was related to anything it was to age; a 17 year-old and 9 year-old will obviously use money in different ways, hence different allowances.


I can certainly understand tying allowances to chores, grades or other such externals, but I don't find it particularly shocking to give allowances just for the kids to have some spending money. After all it is generally considered normal for kids to get food, clothing, shelter, birthday presents, etc ""just for doing nothing"". The line between which things a child gets because they're a child of the family (or because the parents think it would benefit the child to have it) and which things they need to work for or deserve will vary between every family."
"Yes, I can. I followed all the HOA requirements as well as city zoning regulations and such. :)"
"&gt; hid kiddo in his secret den and locked myself in the bathroom to play loud bait to keep dad distracted.

"You're not wasting their time :) they are there to help people like you, in shitty situations! Please be brave and call them (I'm also an introvert so know how hard it is).
I am in shock that these people think it's ok to trespass on your property! I would never dream of doing it myself! Entitled assholes!"
"I could be wrong, but I can't think of a single other reasonable way of interpreting the fact that the roommate said that since OP is dating now, she needs to distance herself so she doesn't get hurt. What possible reason is there that your friend dating someone would mean you neee to distance yourself so you don't get hurt, other than you being in love with your friend?"
"That's ridiculous. The *child* itself isn't a chore, and he didn't say that. ChildCARE obviously is a chore, just like cooking or cleaning- you either work out who's going to do it, or pay someone else to, or a combination. "
"I am also a zombie when I wake up. I get up, let the dog out for potty, I pee, let him in, and then make the bed. I had read somewhere that making it immediately after sleeping in it adds to the odor/dust mite problem because you're trapping whatever sweat, oils, etc. between the sheets instead of letting them air out.

So maybe you get up, pee, make coffee or take a shower, then come back and make your bed. Or you make the bed before you leave the house for the day.

Leave post-its or notes taped to your mirror about making your bed. (Or whatever task it is you want to start habitually doing.)

Adjust your sleep schedule so you don't feel so zombie-like in the AM. I set my alarm 30 minutes before I truly need to be up and moving so I can kind of space out and wake up on my own terms. It's made me much more productive during the day."
"It's possibly she's only hearing the ""when I'm ready"" part and ignoring the ""July"" part -- she's also possibly concerned that even if you get to July, you may still decide you're not ready and change the timeline on her. "

I'm sure her BF would have said some very similar sentiments as well. I wonder if he feels the same. Clearly you're not as invested as he was in her but I think that would almost highlight what most of us are saying in this thread. 
"I wouldn't completely rule it out.

Source: Similar experience in my family."
"But don't you see? None of that is your issue! She's a grown woman, not a child or someone so elderly and infirm she shouldn't be left to fend for herself. You seem to be so conditioned to appeasing/caretaking that you're trying to take responsibility for what happens to her. *She* made the choice to get drunk while watching your kids. *She* made the choice to lie about it. Why isn't she doing the legwork to figure out where she'll go and how she'll live after this? Why are you taking that on as though it's your job?"
"&gt;That's why they're an ex. You should believe him.

Unless he's the shitty ex. Which, considering the shit talking, he's dating an 18 yr old, I'm not inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt."
"&gt; the famous youtuber do it too 

The famous youtubers do their best to avoid revealing personally identifying information. Lots of youtubers and streamers have had problems with stalker-fans finding out their address and showing up at their house, or doing things like 'pranking' them, harassing them, or swatting them (that's where you get a SWAT team called to someone's address to storm their house), sometimes forcing them to move.

I don't know if this is a bigger or more realistic concern than some pedophile kidnapper. But it might seem more relevant to an 11 year old if you describe it in those terms, since they probably don't really understand what a pedophile is, and the threat of kidnapping may seem like an adventure. ""How would you feel if a bunch of trolls found out your address and phone number, and started calling you to abuse you every night at 3am? Mom and dad would be pissed. Pewdiepie does this to stay safe from his haters, so you should do it too.""

It may also help if you go through some of his videos with him to point out just how much information you can learn from them, and from his youtube profile and any social media links. ""Here's the suburb where you live, here's the bus you take, I can google that to figure out where you live, here's where you go to school, here's your name, I used that to find your Facebook, and here's google maps where I can see which way you walk home every day at 4pm."""
"Context made this obvious lol. Buying your kid flip flops the first time you meet them might be a little strangely specific, but it isn't off-putting per se. "
"Call the cops if he lays hands on her. I know you love your mom but she is doing you kids a doservice by staying with this guy. This is not how normal healthy, happy relationships should work. Can you imagine ever acting that way to your future wife? Your mother also should have gone through the proper legal channels to get child support money from your father, but won't. It sounds like you have irresponsible parents on both sides. Is your father interested in you kids at all? You could ask to go live with him if things get bad."
"You don't have to be into the same stuff as your husband. Mine loves all kinds of fitness activities that I hate - dodgeball, running, rock climbing, hiking for hours with a weighted pack in the backcountry in the middle of summer (seriously WTF). I do calmer activities that I enjoy more, like hot yoga &amp; Pilates, flat water kayaking, hiking in established trails, and lifting on my own - not the powerlifting/Crossfit in a super-hardcore-extreme-metal-yelling-Paleo gym kind either BTW. We don't shame each other for our lack of interest in the other person's activities - although I do sometimes tease him about needing to be ""walked"" more than I do.

There's enough common ground in our relationship that we can enjoy our own fitness activities independently. We don't have to do everything in life together as long as there are always things we *do* enjoy together. And occasionally, we do try to make compromises on fitness too. We will hike together sometimes when there's a trail we are both interested in, and he'll come to my yoga classes with me sometimes as long as it's not a hot class.

There must be some old hobbies from your old life that he still enjoys doing. Similarly, there must be some physical activities that both of you are willing to do. What about taking walks together in the evenings? Going to Zumba classes? Doing yoga videos in the living room?"
"I'd say it's more of a yellow flag.

On one hand, it *could* be seen as a **negative** for potential prospects because it could signal:

1. You don't enjoy the idea of sex/you're not interested
2. You might be overtly religious (I put this under negative because it limits you usually to people within your faith only, but being religious is by no means a bad thing)
3. You lack confidence

The lack confidence is a negative because this type of attitude:

&gt;I just sort of gave up on it, accepted that I was unattractive, and decided I'd be alone all my life

is the type of low self-esteem attitude people want to avoid.

However, be that as it may, your past doesn't have to dictate your future, right?

So now that you've met someone that you like, the best thing you should do is come to a level of acceptance:

**Rejection is a possibility for everyone and it's just the way of life.** We ALL experience rejection, from jobs to families to relationships. WE ALL EXPERIENCE REJECTION. You should not avoid taking chances in life for fear of rejection. Really the worst that will happen is you get a ""no"" and then you move on.

By not asking her out, you run the risk of developing an unhealthy level of obsession - and not just of her, but of outcomes *that you can't predict*. You start doing the whole, ""Ah, well, fuck it, I'm not gonna ask. She wouldn't go for me. Why bother? But I really like her....no but it'll be horrible. She'll be so annoyed and I'll be so fucking embarrassed...."". That's anxiety talking. You start taking things out of proportion and spinning some weird perspective.

Ask the girl out! So what if you're scared? You should be PROUD when you take the plunge, even if it doesn't result in a date. Practice makes perfect!

As to an actual date: DON'T bring it up on the first date. In fact, until you guys start having real *heart to hearts*, don't just casually throw it out, like ""I love that type of music as well, oh btw I've never kissed a girl and I'm a virgin...so metal, awesome music, amirite?"".

Good luck!

"How old are your boys? 

How do you feel about the possibility of them going to daycare part time and with your MIL part time? I do the same and see it as a best of both worlds type situation in that my daughter is not stuck in daycare 40-50 hours a week but is still there enough to get the socialization/learning aspect of it (she is almost 3) and also gets the nurturing experience of being able to spend two days a week with her Nona.  "
Yep 12 years together and have really fought maybe once or twice. It doesnt solve the problem and it always has to be followed up with loving calm communication. The only reason we ever fought was because we were feeling extremely stressed and helpless and took our anger out in an incorrect way. It should never be acceptable communication. 
Biting on the inside of your lips? Do people actually do that?
"There are two methods you can do.  Wide-mouth with lips stuck out.  (You just have to be very aware of your teeth, and it's not as tight) Or tight with your lips pulled over your teeth.  
   
Try with a banana or something.  Lips-over-teeth is fine unless it's going for 40 min and the guy can't feel anything without you applying a ton of pressure.   
  
If a guy has death grip the open mouth method won't do anything for him "
"Be careful with choosing facebook though because they've changed their settings so that non-friends who send messages get filtered into another inbox that's much tougher to see (i.e. you have to specifically seek it out, vs the messages that pop-up/notify you when you log in). I'd consider twitter or instagram in order to really ensure she gets the message.

"I'd feel uncomfortable, too, with a relative stranger (the girlfriend) being around my child. Particularly as she appears to have no concept of boundaries, and he seems to be having difficulty setting/enforcing boundaries for her."
They are at the bottom. I see them. Perhaps you have your comment threahold set differently than the rest of us?
"With a gap like that, you're probably always going to feel like a 3rd wheel.  She's going to have friends half your age, and that's going to be absolutely normal for her.  You've made it this way and aren't entitled to be bothered when they've got very little in common with you."
"I wonder she's kinda experiencing a ""grass is greener"" thing. Being in the work force can be really draining-  every job has lots of time spent on meetings, memos and stupid minutia. Given the ages listed she's hit that point where ""yay! Job!"" has been replaced by ""I can't believe I have to keep doing this for my paycheck."" Dropping out of the workforce to take care of a cute little baby sounds soooo much more attractive than doing the daily grind. It's an idealistic fantasy but it's also being fed by the fact her friends are already popping out kids so her social media feed is all baby, all the time now with added Instagram life filter. "

Are you sure he's ready to be married? My SO moved in with me when I was 32, and I couldn't have cared less about what goes where. I had more important shit to worry about, like working. Hell, even video games were more important than what she was throwing on the wall."
You need to really work on getting over him if you still have feelings for him this far out.
"And my mom and through menopause at 45. 

We're just sharing anecdotes. And you can't know when you're going to lose fertility. If you want to have a family, it's best not to bank on being able to start in your 40s. The average age of menopause is between 40 and 60."

These are his true colors. This attitude will set the tone of the entire relationship. I'd definitely consider it a red flag"
"I think ""liar"" is a pretty fair characterization, actually. He didn't tell her he had a change of heart or ask how she felt about staying prior to their agreed-upon deadline. Instead he made a unilateral decision that reneged on their agreement, and he's trying to force her hand by implying he'll stay whether she wants to or not."
"Like 70% of people have HSV-1 and a third of people have HSV-2. It's not a death sentence. Most people don't even know they have it. It's not a ""risk to your long term health"", as you put it. You won't die earlier or be more susceptible to any more diseases. It's not even that big of a deal.

Talk to a doctor. If you're interested in her, wear condoms for the forseeable future and you'll be fine. If you get more serious and want to risk it later on, then you can make sure she's lesion free and avoid the anal area. But for now, wrap it up and see where this goes."
"&gt; Any advice would be really helpful.

So she wasn't drunk or impaired in any way, she went to this party, willingly flirted with this guy, willingly went with him back to his or her/your home, willingly removed her clothes, and willingly had sex with him in bed. Doesn't sound like it was a ""moment"" thing honestly. It sounds very much like she didn't care about you nor the relationship, and just went with it. Because afterall, asking for forgiveness is easier than asking for permission. Because you were coming back, and she probably felt this was her last chance with adventure. It's unfortunate that she lost her dad, and maybe it contributed a bit to her decisions. But the mark of a good and trustworthy partner, is that you don't willingly throw your body at the first warm person you meet the moment life becomes hard. Most people don't cheat on their partners when they're in mourning.

.

Avoiding alcohol doesn't do much if she's making poor &amp; selfish decisions at her very core. This is why if you decide to stay with her, expect the same thing to happen again in the future. If I were in your shoes, I'd almost certainly walk. Getting married and having kids, you can have that, but preferably with someone more trustworthy. At the end of the day though, this is your choice. Try not to have kids with her."

Not all weekend dads are jerks.  Mine worked 60 hours a week growing up. And not a desk job. Legit manual labor. He busted his ass to put food on the table and a roof over my head. It was something I understood at a very young age. I know he's grateful I could see things from his perspective. 
"It sounded like maybe a little much to me, but if you break it down it's $25 a day for each of the 20+ workdays in a month, and that doesn't sound like all that much to me for someone you trust, depending on how much time they're spending and what kind of care they're giving the dogs.

"There's a difference in complexity where geek shit usually has a lot more worldbuilding (because geeks do not like or feel comfortable in the real world) while ""girly"" shows work within more realistic, albeit inaccessible/insane settings but focus more on ridiculously complex social interactions. I'd say that Pretty Little Liars and Gossip Girl can be much more (sometimes needlessly or confusingly) complex than shit like superhero media because of scheming upon scheming. The difference is that it's less about knowing backstories of all the mutants and more about a gigantic chart of different people lying to each other at all times. 

Honestly, I bet these people would get winded at the prospect of trying to chart out half the lies/truths/motivations that happens in ""girly"" shows. "
"Ughhhh.

Okay, let's start with this - Your *husband* messed up *his* job. Not you. He was the one that, despite being told he was on thin ice, insisted everything was okay and he was going to be promoted instead of searching for a new job or improving his performance. He insisted that you put your career and life on hold to accommodate him, yet refused to accommodate when push came to shove.

On top of that, instead of dealing with the immigration issues like he should have before he even moved (which is honestly pretty damn simple), he just didn't and expects you to *give up what you've worked for to accommodate his bad decisions *yet again* *.

You are finally happy, healthy, motivated and on track in your career and you're going to throw *all* of that away because... your partner can't even sack up and pick up after himself? He can't even call a goddamn immigration lawyer or expert to sort out things? This is a man who won't even put in effort to save his relationship with you until you figuratively have your finger hovering over the nuke button over the marriage. He literally cared so little about you, your career, your feelings, *everything* until you got to the point where he would actually have to take responsibility for his actions.

Let him go. Enjoy your life as it is. Divorce him and send him back to Central City. You deserve someone who loves you and wants to make a life *with* you, not at your expense. "
"You keep saying ""this is the only thing that he does wrong really"", but you have listed so many kinds of abuse and disrespect that I don't understand how you can lump them together as ""the only thing."" 

For example, how does refusing to go to the movies you like and insisting you go to his stupid movie fit in the same category as peeing on you? Those are different things. 

Also, you listed several physically abusive behaviors, incl. but not limited to tickling you past your consent, urinating on you, and putting cold water on you. These are ABUSE. Cold showers and tickling someone past the point of comfort are physically abusive. Pissing on you and getting butt stench/butt germs on your phone are mentally and emotionally abusive.

Just gtfo of this relationship. It isn't going to get better. Abusers tend to ramp up their behavior."
"The point that is being made is that your girlfriend still made the effort to go out with you and your friends. What would you have done if she told you that she didn't want to hang out with your friends? Would you have still gone? Would you have dragged her along?

Just sounds like she made a compromise with herself. If she was drinking only straight vodka on a hike, and you only noticed the booze **3 hours into the hike**, then I can't imagine she was so drunk that you had to call off the hike.

So to answer your question, yes, you're making it a big deal, she's obviously trying to reach out and apologize to you and it's not a **huge** breech of trust at all. This can absolutely (and definitely should) be worked through."
"I'm sure OP is fully capable of getting acclimated by herself in Australia.  The problem is the disrespect here.  She's moving thousands of miles away from home to be with him, to only be left behind.  If the trip had been planned prior to her plans on moving there, it would be more understandable, but that's not the case here.  You have to think about the sacrifice she's doing to be with him.  She's leaving family and friends behind, and he doesn't have the decency to wait until she's fully acclimated?  "
"No, you aren't being too picky for not accepting people lying to you. If they are willing to misrepresent themselves for the first meeting, what will they lie about if you choose to date them? They are the ones who are being unfair, not you, because they aren't giving you a chance to make a choice based on a true image. For me, if it had ever happened to me, I wouldn't even go on a date, since I'm not willing to waste my time on people like that. I used to use tinder (before i met my boyfriend there) and it's never happened to me, so I wonder if it happens more on other sites. From the movie, ""the perks of being a wallflower"", they say; ""You accept the love you think you deserve"". Maybe ask yourself what kind of love you think you deserve and how you would like it to start? Once you know, don't let other people influence you on what you want :) "
"You were drugged. Go to the police. Now. 

I'm not from the US ( are you?) So I don't know how much there's still to be done , but if s.o. has some resources for OP who was clearly drugged!!!!!

Edit: reading your friend hasn't answered is a probable sign it was him. Maybe he'll answer you if the fucking police is standing in front of his door.

Edit2: also, if you had been blacked out because of the drinking you would at least remember drinking mire than one beer. Alcohol needs some time till it gets in your blood. Especially if you haven't blacked out before it's not likely that this casual drinking situation made that happen. And if alcohol would've been the cause and you would've puked, you could maybe remember something aftet puking. That is not uncommon. But a direct total blackout after one beer.... I am almost 100% sure alcohol was not the cause."
"&gt;how ***they*** are

no evidence here the wife believes this of everyone. I'd say it's likely she was raised by these people, and knows they're crazy, having dealt with them her whole life, and thus doesn't see the point in dying on this hill when it's a waste of time. "
You still been in contact and continuing the emotional affair with this guy since 2 weeks ago despite what everybody told you before? And obviously you did not take the advice last time and confess your emotional affair to your poor boyfriend have you? I think you're just really here hoping that somebody would tell you you're ok and you're not being disrespectful selfish immature. So will change up the advice a little bit this time. Go ahead and run off with your new boyfriend and blow up your family. I'm sure everything will be just fine. But please try to find a little bit of dignity and tell your current boyfriend everything before he gets too much more invested and what he believes is a good relationship and potential marriage. Unbelievable that people keep coming here we looking for advice and yet continue down the same path despite.

"Girl. 

Carrie Fisher's character in When Harry Met Sally is a serial ""date married men"" kind of woman and there's a running joke about the man not leaving his wife.

Carrie: I don't think he's ever gonna leave her.
Meg Ryan: NOBODY thinks he's ever gonna leave her.

Nobody here thinks he's actually separated from his wife."
"In what way would that be casual? 

""Hey buddy I know we're pals now but check out all these super emotional letters I wrote but never sent you, isn't that neat? Yeah, that one there is a heartbreaker. I keep these in a shoebox right under my bed. Anyway, want to get lunch?""

It has been a few *years* and you only dated for a year to begin with. If you aren't interested in reconciling, why do you still have these letters let alone feel the need to share them with him? It seems very weird to me you'd still have that urge if you're fine being platonic friends. Either talk to someone else about it or get rid of the letters. Don't be strange."

Kinda irrelevant. He certainly should have. 
If it is that important to have space and she is resistant  perhaps it is time to seek marital counseling so you can negotiate with an impartial party this way it isn't your idea or hers per se so there is no need to be defensive.
"I'm sure some people can make it work, given the context of this post and their relationship I'm not quite sure how that's going to work. 

His wife apparently expects a certain life style, according to OP he's done the math and he would need to pull in 60k right off the bat. I'm not even sure how correct that number actually is, especially if they move out west. Add in the fact that he's only expecting to make 40k a year for the near future then I'm positive this solution will work for them. We aren't living in the 50's, it will be hard/impossible for most people to support a family of 4+ on one income, especially if you plan on retiring at a decent age. 

Most of the time both parents need to work to be able to meet their goals. Based on OP's post, I would say they fall into that category. Just because you want to be a SAHM doesn't mean you can afford to be a SAHM. It's all about making compromises and sacrifices, which a lot of the times means putting your wants/needs on the back burner for your family. Which in this case means, she's going to need to get a job, especially if they want multiple children. I don't think she's actually thought this through. Good luck retiring early or being able to pay tuition for multiple children when you only have one annual income of 40-60k. OP might think he's ready to work for the rest of his life now,  if I assure once he gets older he will change his toon. No one WANTS to work well into their 60s-70s the mass majority that do are doing so because they HAVE to. "
"You're right, I could do that.
However my concern is that, like my wife said, she hasn't really crossed the ""friendly"" line. She would most likely just deny it, and I'd look stupid. If she crosses this line I would confront her. 
At this point I feel the problem lies with me, I can't stop thinking about her.
I always wear a wedding ring, have photos of my kids at work. And often talk about my kids. "

"I don't think you're a shitty friend at all.  People do this in relationships all the time: they ignore their friends to spend time with their partner and then when that relationship meets its ultimate demise, they expect you to pretend like it didn't happen.  In reality, being tossed aside like that is extremely hurtful and, of course, that kind of behaviour has consequences.

Based on what you're saying, it doesn't sound like you're all that interested in maintaining the relationship. You are just a good person and feel morally obligated to support her.

To that i say: Fuck.That. The only person who is gonna look after yourself is you. DO NOT sacrifice your personal boundaries (ie, standing your ground and saying no to protect yourself from emotional/physical/mental harm), for someone who would not do the same for you. In other words, have this kind of conversation for her...
""I can do this...but I can't do that"". An example being, ""I can meet you for coffee on this day at this time, but I cannot respond to every text you send me, every second of the day"".

Boundaries are key for dealing with needy people like this.  Otherwise they will suck the life out of you and then you will both end up crazy!"

"I'm not sure I agree that he would have to have behaviours like the ones you describe for porn to be a problem in his life.

"I have a similar problem to your girlfriend. After lots of therapy, we realized that it's actually a control issue and a form of passive resistance. It's like I'm making myself a parent of myself, which I then have to rebel against. It's exhausting, honestly. (And if your girlfriend is anything like me, the very last thing you should do is put yourself in that parent/coach role.) 

However, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) has helped me a fair bit. Also, my therapist frames it this way: everything is a choice. Just choose to do the thing, whatever it is. Choose to go running, choose to clean the bathroom, choose to study, etc. it takes all of the ""motivation"" out of it. You make the choice, and you don't have to be happy or excited about it."

"My mom would do a list of chores (daily and weekly) and assign a value to each chore. You got paid for what you did. I later learned the highest value chores were ones my mom hated doing. For example, we had three flights of stairs in the house, with fairly sized landings on each floor, I would get £5 a week for hoovering them and the landings, my mom hated doing the stairs. I, however, as a little kid absolutely loved doing it and using the stair vacuum (little red thing with a monster face on it).

He's actually warning you off from him more than from a career you're interested in, work you're more than capable of, in a field where there's always opportunities.

Bad habits are things like chewing with your mouth open or hitting the snooze button every morning. Stimming is related to OCD, specifically compulsion. It's way harder to break than a normal bad habit because it's something that relieves anxiety by sending oxytocin to the brain - it's chemical. For example, I have OCD, and one of my compulsions is picking. I pick at my nails and skin when I'm stressed or bored, and it keeps me calm. I've tried to quit for the last 20 years, but my brain is actively fighting me on it.

"I think in that case, the most fair would be what you would pay if you were single, but (heavily) reduced.

So if market value is $1k, but you would get a $750 dollar place: the rent would start at $750. That's the starting point.

But knock it down depending on how much you're helping with the kid stuff. That will really vary, so we can't give too much advice here- if you're just picking them up, that's not much. If you're getting close to SAHD status, then it should be significant reduction.

But i think it's important to be slightly higher than just expenses. Maybe in the ~$200 something range- that will cover general wear and tear. Not all of which will show up in expenses- if you use the dishwater for 2 years more often, maybe it breaks in 8 years instead of 10, but if you broke up after 2 years, then you would never see that cost. That's the sort of thing rent is designed to cover.

That way, you're still saving a ton of money (for a nicer place than you'd get normally, to boot)"

I get that, but you're not the only one in the marriage. He doesn't want things back the way they were, and he wasn't as happy back then. He feel better now, is happier, and enjoys doing these things. And his needs and health matter, too, right? 

So you can either leave him - which is a perfectly valid thing to do if you're not happy! - or you can be supportive of his fitness. But changing him isn't an option you have, so complaining that you want things back the way they were isn't helping you. "

But it's not healthy and I know it, and I can stay like this, or I can push myself to work out a little more and eat better so I look and feel better. If you don't want to, fine.

And now people are encouraging op to play the blame game on the mom, but that'll look childish and tacky. When an event has your name on it, people consider it your responsibility.

There is no such thing as a friend zone and please stop calling women females. Also stop pretending to be someone's friend in order to get closer to them.

"Hi, abuse doesn't start out with punching you. It starts out with eroding your boundaries. Abusers also have ""reasons"" for what they do. They're anxious about you leaving, so they hide your keys so you can't leave the house. They're anxious about you making them look bad, so they tell your friends that you're crazy. They're anxious that you're cheating on them, so they call you names when they think you're dressing too slutty. Anxiety doesn't excuse abuse. Mental illness doesn't excuse abuse. ""Needing help"" doesn't excuse abuse. None of these things make an action not abusive. "

"&gt; I've been feeling extremely isolated. I feel like I am confined to my house. I have to ask his permission on everything. I have money from my tax return from my job from last year but as soon as it runs out, I know I will have to rely on him and that is something I do not want to do.

My shoulders are up around my ears and all the hair on my neck is standing on end.

This is BAD.  Please start planning to flee this awful situation, before it gets so, so much worse (and it will.  Oh, it will.)"
"First you accuse me of being ""super easy for jocks"" and then say ""i rejected guys like him"". 

This thread is specifically about how i didn't reject a lot of guys ;)"
"Yes, I agree. If the landlord has no easy place to store the unused furniture, you're putting her in a spot to either have to get rid of the furniture, and have to pay to replace it, or pay to store it."
I mean that's very true. But dumping the kids with a friend and then not telling them anything isn't cool at all. 
You can't fix a rapist. This is someone who gets gratification from raping people. The fuck are you doing condoning his behavior by associating with him?
"""Don't try to use my period as an excuse when you're being a bitch""

""Or I just have healthy, normal, legitimate feelings.""

""I'm sorry your period has caused you to be a bitch, but please don't project on to me.""

""Your menopause is causing you to be irrational.""

Also sometime try sitting her down and explaining that your feelings are legitimate and what she is doing is rude and dismissive.  "
"I make a lot less money than my SO, moved into the place he owns and we plan to marry later this year... So by your standards, he'd be making a huge mistake if I didn't sign a pre-nup?

Would you bother to check which of the two of us is cooking the meals, managing the social calendar, taking care of our home to allow him to have enough time to have the high-paying, stressful job? Would you care that I'm the one who makes him feel better at the end of a long day or that despite whatever disagreements we might have, I am always in his corner? Would you want to try to like me and learn what my interests are? Or would I be seen as the enemy from day 1 for stealing your brother away from you as we form our own ""actual"" family?

The difference between his situation and Pat's is that my in laws have always treated me with respect and have seen their son/brother as an adult since he, you know, became old enough to have that high paying job and own the house you're so worried about. Get your head out of your ass and apologize sincerely to Pat and Nat before it's too late... Because the true outcome of them having kids at this point isn't that he'd be ""stuck"" with her, but rather that those kids will likely grow up without knowing the cruel relatives who tried to tear their family apart."
"Your mum going possibly downhill really can't be your priority. If she was drunk once imagine how many times she could have been drunk before and looking after your kids. What if there had been an emergency? She would not have been able to respond. She is an adult and responsible for her own choices/actions.

I am completely on your wife's side. Yes, I understand that the kids love their grandma. But you as the parent need to decide what is safe and best for them. They can still have contact with her.... If she's sober (or whatever scenario you create/deem acceptable) but your kids probably also like junk food but they probably aren't allowed to eat that 24/7 because you as the parents decided that it wasn't good for them. 

Right now, you and your wife need to get on tue same page. If you pick your mum over your children/family it will cause issues in your marriage. 

"
"I think that's really being too harsh on OP? Having a high school degree is the most basic of educational qualifications required to have a job, and while you get genius college drop outs like Jobs and the like, they generally coasted their way through high school and college and only dropped out when they figured out the time they were spending at uni was actively hindering their career. Are you trying to argue that dropping out of *high school* could be taken as a ""smart"" move in any way? "
"Yeah it was legal to drop out here at 16 too... with parental consent.  High school was awful for me,  but my mother would NOT consent to me dropping out so I graduated.  You are his guardian;  you would have to sign off to allow him to do out as he's still a minor.  Send the entitled twerp to your brother's.  I had a hard time with my parents and lived with my sister and her husband for a while in high school... I did ALL of the cleaning in their house out of sheer gratefullness that they let me stay with them.  He's taking advantage and it needs to stop."
Unless they are really stuck up and judgmental like you are.
The baby is going to jam those in his mouth when he gets mobile. He needs to get into significantly better habits before crawling. 
Yeah she sounds like a sociopath 
"If you want to stop something and can't, that's a sign that it's gotten out of control. Don't listen to people here that are telling you there's no problem.

If this issue is bringing you some pain, you might consider cognitive behaviour therapy - it's often used to break habits or addictions. You can get a referral from your family doctor at your next appointment, or just ask about what to do. "
You're not listening to the OP at all. Happy for you that you could apparently afford stuff your whole life; some can't.
"Are you really friends with this woman? You said you moved on while she sees you as her best friend... I get being a broke student but I mean, even with the short timeline, you surely knew and understood your financial situation. Your loans are on a schedule, you know how to look up the price of a bus ticket... 

I think instead of looking at whether this is the right or wrong thing to do I'd think about whether you want to be friends with her. That'll help make the decision clearer IMO."
"My birthday isn't for another month. I told him all I want is to be woken up with with a nice cup of coffee. But yeah he is broke. He shows love through gift giving, but not usually on the actual date. Like I got a new phone for Christmas....in October. :)"
"No I know it isn't, it never was. To begin with it was meant to be something adorable for my husband. Instead it's something sinister and life changing, nobody appreciates this fact more than I. 


I just don't feel I have the capacity to appear as if nothing is wrong. I wish I did, but the reality is that I do not. I also feel that it would do our relationship harm for me to withhold the information. "
"Two examples, say my name is Julia. Since my niece Jessie was born my mom has called me by her name 3/4 of the time. Growing up she called my brother by the dog's name all the time (Mike/Max). It's just a thing people's brains do. "
"No, she should be having them in her own room. They're her kids. I don't see how OP has to not to be able to live properly in her own home because of another person's kids. It's the mother who should have made sure that's ok. She didn't say anything and now pushes her needs through on OPs cost. Not okay. I don't think it's OPs responsibility to assume everything here. "
"I think it's a little out there to be sad and pouty for more than a week over a patently absurd (a 5 month old baby supplies a gift for someone's birthday) without expressing that expectation first, yes.

Apparently there is, however, a cultural norm that has shifted that I was completely unaware of."
"So why the hell would they let a *guest* treat their daughter like shit? This girl is biting the hand harder than anyone.  I'm all for respecting your parents, but this is unreal."
Same.  This is entirely unheard of for me.

"I was in a very similar situation for over 8 months and I did what you did, just smile and stay positive and do my work.

Turns out the bullying group have been watching my every move and criticizing me to my boss and trying to get me fired. 
I had no idea this was going on till my boss asked me privately what was going on and I finally told her every thing that had been happening and how disrespected and devalued I felt in this working environment.

She was furious and immediately told me she would shut this bullying down instantly. She had a talk with the lead guy. Then that lead guy came out crying. And he apologized to me. 

Now they're all trying to be surface level nice to me. And that lead guy and I hardly speak. 

I don't give a fuck anymore what they think or what they say. I'm glad I told EVERYTHING to my boss. She was furious and she said she felt something was off and she would escalate this to HR if that's what I wanted. 

I decided no not to escalate to HR, see If it can be handled within us.

Either way, all seems okay from now. I'm sure they're still talking shit about me with each other and to our boss. 

I'm sick of the drama and gossip they're creating. I have only ever been kind to them. So fuck it.
I'm looking for another job. "
Because your experience is not universal. 
I'm honestly confused as to how the church leadership hasn't stepped in already. Multiple participants in the youth group have stopped coming because of physical violence from another member? Rumors are being spread about the youth group leader dating one of the girls? The pastor should have started dealing with this long ago. 
It's because OPs husband is afraid to stand up to his mommy when she stomps on boundaries. The solution to the puppy issue is secondary to the real problem.
"It was only up briefly.  Her MIL had been begging to babysit so they could go out for a date night.  Mom had told her repeatedly to not change the baby into overly warm clothes, no blankets or pillows in the crib, etc.

They get a call from FIL to go to the emergency room.  Paramedics reported that they found the baby DOA dressed in oversized hot clothing, wrapped up in a large fluffy blanket.  Baby had suffocated.

It was heartbreaking. Two months later the husband was asking her to reconcile with the MIL and forgive her.  Mom was thinking about divorcing the husband, because she believed that the MIL had committed murder by disregarding the parents safety instructions. I agree with mom and I hope she got away from those people."
"She really should have brought the side trip up with you before making the plans. That way she would avoided any embarrassing moments with cancelling. I'm a pretty open person, and this situation would probably make me a bit on edge as well. I think discussing future communication strategies is in the cards for you as a couple."
"I'm usually anti controlling husband. But yea, you'd never drive my car again. "
"Yeah, I would definitely be questioning whether I wanted to have a baby with this guy. He obviously holds his mother's feelings in higher regard than the welfare of living things. "
"Then he should tell her he doesn't want to get married so they can break up and find people more suited to them, as she obviously wants marriage after 6 years, which is more than reasonable."
"I'm not sure what your question is?  How do you make things better?  Well, you might not be able to.  Give her some time for now to process everything, but she ultimately may not want to continue the relationship and you'll need to accept that.  "
She got into a relationship with someone a month after he left his pregnant ex and she's talking about marriage. That screams naive.
"Do it. You've clearly wanted to break up with him for years. Yeah you cheated, but it seems to me that you did it because you wanted an iron-clad reason not to get back together with this guy. One that'll make him upset enough that he won't try to rekindle the relationship. Definitely don't visit him. That'd put you in prime territory for him to talk you back into starting your awful rocky relationship cycle over again. Maybe do it over email. And don't give in if/when he tries to pressure you into giving it another shot. 

tl;dr: Break up with him now. Don't visit. Don't get back together with him under any circumstances. Enjoy feeling free."
"Actually, no, they shouldn't be getting counselling together. He's controlling, manipulative and emotionally abusive. His type doesn't respond well to relationship counselling; either they claim the therapist and the spouse are ganging up on them and they halt the counselling quickly, or more insidiously, they twist the counselling to their advantage to further manipulate their spouse.

Since he is one of the dumbest abusers I've ever come across on this sub, it's more likely to be the former. In any case, the OP should push for them to get individual counselling if she really wants to save the relationship. Personally I think she should walk."
"You should be really skeptical of this. Therapists don't diagnose people who aren't there. They don't speculate on people who aren't there. That doesn't sound right at all, it sounds like he's twisting it, or even making it up, to get you to do things."
"Right here. I posted above about my ex putting me and my career down, and I think a lot of it stemmed from his insecurities. I think he had insecurities about his self-image and I was pretty secure in mine so he needed to knock me down a peg. 

Your husband seems to be putting you down for getting a degree, most likely because of his insecurities about his lack of formal education, how he fell into his career, etc. I have seen this behavior from people who did not succeed in college and fell into high paying careers.

 I have a brother and cousin like this. It turns out they both had undiagnosed/untreated ADHD, making school very rough for both of them, though they are both extremely intelligent and have self-taught many things (though the lack of classroom education makes them the worst to debate or discuss things with!) They each struggled to finish HS and hold down jobs initially, and college was out of the question. 

My brother became very successful,  falling into a financial analyst job and makes way more money than I do with my Master's--but he's much more limited in his job opportunities. He pretty much has to stay with this company and relocate when they say, because he doesn't even have an HS diploma. If he went to another company looking for the same position, he most likely would be turned away due to his educational level. 

My brother and cousin have often put down college, and until I found out about their learning disabilities, I could never figure out why. Traditional school can be very unforgiving to people with undiagnosed learning disabilities--it actially makes me so sad and angry now. This makes more sense now--they appeared to reject the institution, but really it had rejected them first. 

I don't know that this is your husband's core issue, but I suspect some sort of resentment or jealousy that you're succeeding in college. Talking others out of college or saying it's a waste of money, it's a luxury item you should sacrifice, etc., is the classic line I have heard from people who actually didn't do well in school."
"1. She's right, you absolutely need to wear condoms if you two have sex.

2. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, if this ends up happening it'll be a private thing between the two of you that's nobody else's business. From the sound of things though, she might either be embarrassed about the arrangement or maybe not super comfortable with people knowing the two of you are FWB. It's entirely up to you whether or not this part is a dealbreaker. If you're cool with this being a secret, go for it, but if you don't feel comfortable or feel condescended to, you can respectfully decline."
"Lots of rape victims don't want to call what happened to them rape. It's a shitty coping mechanism. I had a friend like  that. She made excuses. Oh well I didn't say no. Oh well I did tease him earlier that night. Etc.  

You know what happened? She got raped again. And STILL couldn't face what happened to her. Years later she had a meltdown because she lived so long with this inside of her. 

OP NEEDS to talk to someone. His feelings don't overrule the TRUTH of what happened. "
I think you should ask the doctor to lie about being a match and pretend to have you signed up. Tell him/her the whole story about how your parents are threatening you. Has your half brother said anything?
"Who’s child is it? Yours. Who gets to decide? You and your husband. MIL can make suggestions, but you shouldn’t feel pressured into naming your child with a name you’re not really into. Maybe you’ll come around maybe you won’t, but DO NOT name your child based on what your MIL asked. That’s so dysfunctional.

And just so you get my meaning here, the sticking point isn’t the name here, that’s pretty much like colors and taste, people will like what they like. The bit that bothers me is the fact that she’s pushing it. It would have been veeeeeery different if it was your husband that said “hey I’d like to name him after my father, what do you think?”.

As a personal tip, if you’re just tired of her pushing it onto you, just say “yeah yeah. i’ll think about it. we’re not there yet”. Whether you actually do think about it or not, that’s up to you.

Also, Earl Grey is just … dear lord the cringe."
"He brought home a magazine, his wife burned it. His wife then told him that he should never bring similar things back to their home and broke a door jam. 

If genders were reversed abuse would have already been claimed. Forget his comments, the OP itself showed something was wrong with the wife in this situation."
"Get a lock on your door, or move out. That's really all you have the ability to do here. Invest in good headphones or earplugs as well. "
"But she's a mom, so as far as /r/relationships is concerned she isn't held to an adult standard"
He's been gone on a work trip most of this week and returns today! I've cleaned up most of the apartment and did a ton of laundry while he was out so this weekend we can do some relaxing and not have a ton to do before we have visitors next weekend. I can't wait to see him tonight!
"They likely pretended not to know each other when first ""reintroduced"" and then it never came up again. Not that unbelievable. This is hardly some great secret that his friend and wife were harbouring and obligated to tell him. 


If OP goes into the conversation saying she ""lied to his face for 4 years"" and other dramatic shit without first hearing her explanation, he's going to make the situation worse."
"Take a page out of the other DIL's book and stop talking to her. You're never going to win and you're just going to cause unessisary stress to your life until you figure this out. 

Cut her down to very low contact like the other DIL. "
"&gt; Also, she definitely looked hispanic and had a Spanish accent. However, she said that her parents were of European.

The use of 'however' makes it seem like you find it **strange** or somehow nonsensical that she looked hispanic/had the accent, but her parents were european."
The idea that wearing a thong and spending time with your gf and her friends is indicative of your maturity as a person is ludicrous. Get off it.
"He is your co-worker not your underling or your boss so it isn't that drastic to date him, might make things a bit uncomfortable if you have a horrendous break up but that is just what rolling the dice is.

&gt; At the same time I want someone to tell me it's okay to like him

It is ok to like him seems a good guy

You don't say whether you think he likes you or not?

Don't go all out on him just ask him if he fancies going for a coffee or lunch or something and if he says yes go and have fun. Take it slow because 'don't shit where you eat' is actually a thing bt lots of people have great relationships with co workers. Go for it why not life is short. "

I don't usually have strong emotional reactions to  r/relationships posts but this shit made me fucking furious. You are NOT overreacting. Get out. 
"These are big explosive negatives. He is emotionally and verbally abusive. This will escalate (very likely) to physical abuse when you feel you have no way out. Relationships that start with ""love bombing"" (very intense in the beginning, lots of talk about commitment etc) can end up abusive because they are setting you up to have an extra strong connection of the good times for when they start to manipulate you to destroy your self esteem and make you isolated and feel completely alone - that way you have no-one to help you leave. "
"One person doesn't speak for the entire profession, nor does stating that veterinary school being more difficult means that they're hating on doctors.

How can I take you seriously and not complete BS if you can't even spell veterinarian correctly? You're a joke lmao

If you want statistics, they're easy to google. Average applicant for veterinary school is required to at least have 200 hours of veterinary experience (different from animal experience) and most competitive ones need 1000 to 3000 hours. Medical schools usually /recommend/ about 50 hours, not even required.

I know veterinarians who have performed surgery on humans for colleagues, but medical doctors specialize in human medicine for a reason. "
"This brings up another point...many real doctors recommend MMR boosters/up-to-date immunizations for anyone that is around a baby. This includes the whooping cough vaccine. So, her family will probably be unwilling to comply with that recommendation. Hell, your GP may be unwilling to treat your child if s/he is unimmunized. "
"This was the kind of passionate response that will hopefully resonate.  I essentially said what you wrote out in broken up forms throughout our discussion last night.

"Yeah this was in the middle of our argument when I told him I felt humiliated, and he showed me all these messages as proof that people are laughing at it, it is just a prank, I should take ""a chill pill"" "

As for the health issues see if there is a school nurse to talk to or a free health screening somewhere. Maybe even look up healthcare hotlines.

"Of course you are deeply in love, deal crap hasn't hit the fan yet and you are in the honeymoon phase. Everything is new, lust is ruling etc. no one is telling you not to marry they are saying it's to soon. 

You are saying he MAY get deported? If so then why not stay together and deal with that in the future or do you think your relationship can't handle that? - if that's the case your marriage won't work either.

"Dude you're married, it IS inappropriate to be hanging out in 19 year old girls dorm rooms. It just is. It's not even about you cheating necessarily."
"The thing is I don't even know why I have so much stuff. I halved my clothes/possessions last time I moved house. Looking at my floor it's all stuff I use regularly - my workout gear, a book I'm reading, all of my paperwork/bills, vinyl player, shoes, etc.

"Dissociation is a common response to trauma, and it can read as inappropriate casualness or a flat emotional affect about a situation. Read closely:

&gt; That being said, I haven't found those underwear since, which scares me but I'm trying not to think about...Honestly want to move on and pretend this never happened.

Mentally ""looking the other way"" is an incredibly common response to being involved in something traumatic that you *intuit* is likely to disturb you, so as a kind of self-preservation mechanism, you think about something else and try to laugh it off. This woman isn't an idiot who doesn't know how serious it is to mysteriously blackout after a single drink then discover your underwear is missing and you've been cleaned up. She's clearly terrified by how serious this is; it's just that like most 22 year olds, what conceivable mental tools does she have for dealing with that?"
"OMG seriously. As someone who married VERY young, I had to revisit the top of this post to see how old they really are when I got to the part about her daily tears over not yet being married. She has come to prioritize the ring and the status of being married over having a healthy and fulfilling relationship and enjoying the day to day. How sad for her. It's fair to want those things in life and to want a partner who wants those too but when you find yourself pulling your partner along behind you just to check the box, you have really messed up your priorities. "
"&gt;Could I be emotionally abusing her somehow without telling at her, calling her name's, criticizing her or... Anything?

Yes. I'm not saying that you ARE doing that, but you definitely CAN. 

- Being cold to her.
- Ignoring her. Blatantly not listening when she tries to converse or connect with you. 
- Stonewalling her. If you clearly have negative feelings towards her but just stay clammed up and cold about it. 
- Avoiding her. Spending as much time as possible away from her. 
- Contempt. If you show by your words, opinions, comments or even facial expressions that you have contempt/resentment or even hatred for her. If you roll your eyes when she talks or glare at her when you arrive at home. 

Any of those sound more familiar instead of yelling and namecalling?"
That's noble of you but not necessarily fair... offer to do sex-positive couples counseling and work through this 
Good idea! I will do that

You really can't imagine why someone would find this kink repulsive? I mean, I love my SO, but if he had a diaper fetish or anything else involving fecal matter and/or acting like a child we'd be done. Not because I'm disgusted by him, but because it would kill my attraction permanently. I would never be able to look at him the same way again.

"&gt; their ""pick up"" skills (which is all lies, no truth behind it).

That's not quite true. It's not that it doesn't work. It's that it's dehumanizing and abusive.

If they didn't work, no one would stay in an abusive relationship. :/"

"If you want to report her and think it will be too obvious to do so anonymously, there is a way you can report her while seeming innocent of intent to cause SIL harm, which should significantly reduce the blowback. 

Say that you called your practitioner's board (or whatever it is) to ask if *you* could get any trouble for giving second-hand advice, because you've just found out a family member has been passing your advice on to her Facebook friends. Say it never even entered your mind that *she* could be in trouble since she's not a member (or licensed, or whatever). But then they called you back because they started digging and found her Facebook, and started asking more questions, and that's when you realised she could be in trouble too. 

This is a story you can tell quite openly (and I suggest you tell it ""confidentially"" to the biggest gossip). I mean, people who don't understand the issue will still be annoyed with you, but it won't have the same malicious feel about it. It will blow over a lot more readily than the story ""OP deliberately reported SIL and got her budding career shut down."""

"I would probably tell him that I wasn't willing to mediate between them. If he wants *advice*, then sure (the advice being: get help for his drinking and the anger/financial problems that come with it), but not passing information. Or acting as therapist for relationship problems in general, really - if he tried, I'd suggest talking to someone whose job it is to do that and can probably help him better. Putting up that big boundary and not talking to him when angry would be my minimum requirements, I think."

Maybe he doesn't need to be inconsiderate and could participate in her hobbies. 
"&gt; What should I do?

If you can't get over it, then there's absolutely nothing wrong with ending it right here and now. Clearly not on the same page and all. Lots of folks have this option available to them yet never take it, and they let insecurity and pain plague the early start of the relationship because of it. Sometimes, it's just easier and painless to not pursue things any further, and simply find someone else."
