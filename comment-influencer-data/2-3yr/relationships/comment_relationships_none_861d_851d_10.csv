"They didn't just sleep together, like it came out of the blue one day. They had an ongoing attraction and intimacy that they fed until they felt comfortable sleeping together.

When bf said ""they remembered you"", I think he spoke the truth more than you realize. I don't know how well I can explain, but for me, the most important part of a serious relationship is being on the same team. Knowing what the other person knows. Knowing that the other person has your back. Having information that you need withheld by the people closest to you is betrayal.

In no part of their budding relationship did either of them have your back. And I mean Relationship. In your little circle of three, you're not in either the ""best friend"" or ""husband/wife"" relationship. They are. They're on the same page, sharing information, emotions, sex, working together to figure out what to do with you. Isn't that rightfully *your* place?"
"I did this afterwards - my boss said she would tell him to stop harassing her employees if he showed up at my work again, and would also call security if he shows up again. I've notified my coworkers as well and they've been told to say I'm not at work if anyone asks. 

My coworkers have been angels too, they walked with me to my car after my shift because I was parked pretty far away. "
"Haha exactly its not like they won't be able to get away from us if they want to, its in a fucking huge open space. 
The only reason im not inviting the other girlfriend is because shes heavily pregnant so she will either be ready to pop or have a tiny newborn by the time the festival comes about. I have no idea why she would be upset about other girls going anyway as she obviously cant come herself. And if she doesn't want her boyfriend going thats between them, nuthin to do with me. "
"Captain Awkward or Dr. NerdLove would be good places to start, OP! "
"True, I know some kids who dress really well. Their clothes fit them and they aren't all old and worn out/stained. "
"She's clearly deeply damaged, but she's also aware enough of it to avoid situations that will cause her to act irrationally. That self-awareness could be a sign that she's in therapy and coping with her problems in a (somewhat) healthy way.

These are yellow flags, and they are super early. So if you'd rather avoid the risk you should go. But it doesn't sound like a bright red flag.

"
"*Sizzle* 
That straight fire right there.
"
I hope you guys had a great time together on your DATE.  Way to go!
"What can you do?


Dump him. "
"Here's the thing, his opinion isn't the only one whose matters in their relationship. He may not consider it cheating, but she may. Either way, you're still getting involved in their relationship. If you continue this relationship with him it will most likely become a point of contention in his future relationships unless he can work out some sort of poly/open relationship. 

Though question, if a third party were to find out, would you be comfortable with others knowing? It's likely to happen sooner or later. Spouses/Partners who suffer infidelity can end up vindictive to both the cheating partner and the person they committed the infidelity with.   

Is all the possible drama and outcomes worth it?"
"UC DAVIS REPRESENT

and fuck you, you are going to get zero advice on this sub how to be a scumbag and fuck a girl that has a boyfriend."
Yeah they don't have similar life goals at all! She's stuck in purgatory.
"Maybe she had second thoughts, changed her mind, got cold feet. But then thought about it more and decided to go for it. It's not necessarily inherently shady. I'd say he should go on the date, try to get to know her better. But be on the lookout for any signs she might be flaky. "
"It's hard to explain, but people tend to assume that you can learn about other people from their homes. When you go into someone's home, you look around and go ""oh, this is who they are."" When there is nothing on the walls and a mattress on the floor, it's like, ""who is this guy? What am I supposed to look at? Is this actually where he lives, or does he have another apartment somewhere else? Is he Ted Bundy?""

Edit: I dated a guy for a bit who had an apartment like yours. I gave him some landscapes because it felt like I was in an insane asylum or something with the bare walls.  "
"Honestly, it doesn't sound like there was an expectation that you hadn't seen the material before. 

If it comes out, volunteer to be tested again with another piece of code. You can do the work."
"Um yeah, this one is pretty much a no brainer. You deserve to be broken up with. She was uncomfortable with the trip but sucked it up because it meant a lot to you, then you go and screw it up by being cozy with the other girls. Not much can be said except I hope you learned your lesson as to save the next gf from this same heartache. "
"Can confirm - I lease a horse twice a week.  I can theoretically afford to own one but don't really have the time right now.  

Buying two horses as a rank beginner seems like a terrible idea.  And it sounds like one of the horses wasn't even trained?"

"I feel bad for him. It's obvious that he's looking for validation from you that he is actually a person with all these traits, because I think he's secretly afraid that you're right and he gets an easier time and he's not the hard-working person he wants to believe he is.

Insecurity is normal. I would stop focusing on his looks completely. People focus on his looks all the time, I'm sure he's dealt with that his whole life, and you're his partner so look deeper. Start complimenting him on the traits you love about him. Is he thoughtful? Kind? Goofy? Creative? Friendly?

And one day, if you're in a both healthy place and having a good time, try to have a conversation about what would make him prove to himself to that he's the person he wants to be. If he wants to prove to himself that he's hard-working, maybe he can train up to a race. Or whatever, you know. Help him define goals for himself that support the person he wants to be, and help him meet those.

I see this with kids a lot, they receive so much external validation that they have trouble trusting their own senses of self-measurement. If you just tear him down, there's nothing left to support a sense of self so they get defensive. Instead, you have to help them figure out how to build their own emotional core and you just listen, probe, and support."
"Being in a well paid job would actually give you more resources to help them as they get older. You'd be in a much better position to help them as I'm sure as they get older they will only need more help. Having the money to pay for extra equipment and home help can only be a good thing. 

Getting out and bettering yourself is the responsible thing to do even if your mother can't see that right now. She's only thinking of the short term view and not what will be needed in the future."
"Ok. Does she ever get a break? Do you take the baby on weekends and/or nights sometimes so she can have some peace and quiet too? Maybe she's sitting and eating ice cream because she's a stay at home mother who has a screaming, needy, poop machine attached to her all the time and needs a break every once in a while. 
Why would you spend so much money for her to lose weight but not consider counseling?? Her losing weight IS NOT going to fix your problems and you need to realize that regardless of weight, beauty is going to fade anyway. For BOTH of you. You're both going to get old and ugly whether or not she (or you) gains weight.
I understand that you're frustrated, but you need to be thinking about how she must feel in all of this as well. Do you realize how boring and exhausting it is to take care of a baby all day, every day? I'm not a mother, but I have done a ton of babysitting. Children take a lot of work and it's exhausting. Do you do any chores around the house? Those responsibilities should be shared. You may work all day and not want to clean, but she's also working all day and won't want to clean either. As a father it is your responsibility to take care of your child, and help with the household chores. You shouldn't have gotten married or chosen to have a child if you didn't want to do these things.
Have you talked to her about any of this? A relationship can not survive without communication."

"If there's a phone in your hand, get off the road!

So many claim to be okay with the phone glued to their ear while driving, while statistics and studies show otherwise. I'm sure it's all too common here; people have stories enough of nearly being hit, seeing drivers veer out of lanes, bump other vehicles or pedestrians. All because of a phone against the ear. But does this persuade drivers? No! It's always ""someone else"" who has problems with mobile phones when driving, never somebody confronted on it, they're just fine. Bullshit. They're also a statistic waiting to happen.

Even if you had no anxiety condition, you have every reason to be anxious!"
"He Ted Moseby-ed you. It's fine. He's young. He doesn't know how this shit goes yet. Just don't say it back if you're not ready, and he'll drop it probably.

I did that to a gf before because I was dumb. I'm thankful she didn't hold it against me. We stayed together for 3 years."
"&gt; Like stated above, if it wasn't agreed upon and just assumed 

I have no idea what you're talking about. 

We're not talking about housework or anything related to their relationship, here. OP and Wife have separate jobs, at separate businesses. 

OP earns his salary by working 30 hours a week. Wife earns her salary by working 40 hours a week. What is there to be irritated by? If one spouse in a relationship is a teacher and the other isn't, should the non-teacher be irritated that the teacher doesn't have to work during the summer? That's preposterous. 

&gt; I do all the farm work, the house maintenance, volunteer in two organizations, etc. Ten hours is a huge difference in my life when I am the person doing everything in my household.

And it sounds like your life has almost absolutely zero relevance to OP's issue. Why does your life situation matter in this instance?"
"Oh God that breaks my heart. I feel bad too because I didn't even think of mental illness. Nothing is diagnosed in her family but her mom is a narcissistic nut, dad was verbally abusive. I don't think I let her walk all over me. We used to have civil disagreements where I could say no and stand up but I've just been rolling over lately because I don't want to make her cry or yell."

"I think it would be a real ""accident"" if he hadn't targeted such a young and unsuspecting victim. What he did was just plain stupid and needs punishment so he can learn to never do that again. He's also old enough to get a job and pay it off. "

"There are ways to be active in her life without requiring her to switch houses every other week, though. You could keep coaching her teams. You could have dinner with her one on one on a regular schedule. You could start up an email correspondence with her.

I'm divorced, I live less than a mile from my ex, and we split custody 50/50, one week on, one week off. The thing is, though, the kids will reach an age where we will not be able to force them to do things. If, when our children are teenagers, they decide they don't want to spend the night with one of us, there is nothing to stop them from using their feet to walk to the place they prefer to sleep. At that point, if it were my house, I would want to have a serious talk with the kids about what they need to do to stay in touch with their other parent (""you need to email your dad at least two paragraphs every day, take his phone calls, and have a meal with him every X often""). If they prefer to stay with him, that is what I would want him to insist they do for me."

It can fuck up your teeth as a child when you're still growing and everything is flexible. It's completely fine as an adult.
"What I don't see in your post is the context of these questions. If she gave them to you so that the two of you can sit down and discuss what you BOTH think about them, that's a good thing. If you are expected to answer like a test, then no. If your ""discussion"" is her testing you and sitting in judgement of your answers then no. 

"
"The double standard is a little concerning given that you sent that picture in a private message and he's behaving like you're whoring yourself out in public and threatening you with ending the relationship if you send another picture that could be remotely interpreted as vaguely sexual.

I'm concerned that he may have a Madonna/Whore complex going on that may have disastrous consequences should you ever have children with this guy."
"Given the general lack of Caps and punctuation, I read that last bit as:

"It would have been super weird if that were on the posters, tho. "
"It absolutely is abuse. He doesn't have to actually hit or punch you to be abuse. Grabbing you and forcing you around is abuse, holding your mouth shut so you can't talk is abuse. Don't think that just because he was that the he is awesome."
"Whipping out your phone during social interaction is usually seen as rude. Unless you're specifically asked to google something, of course.

Imagine stopping someone in the middle of a story going; ""I'm sorry but that was in 1882, not 1884"". It doesn't matter, the social interaction matters, it's a meeting of brains, not computers. 

Make a mental note of a topic and research it later if you have to."
"You absolutely were manipulated into this. OP, there are very few schools these days where the students do NOT have to sign a covenant stating that they are responsible for their own work and that they understand that the consequences can include expulsion. This extends beyond just plagiarism, and your assistance (and her ex-bf's before you) falls fully under that umbrella.

If she can't or won't do the work herself, exactly what degree is she earning? This diminishes other people's actual efforts, as well. Not to mention that if she doesn't actually learn the material herself, she's not going to be much use if she works in that field later on, but either way, this is very serious and could not only get her kicked out of her school, it could make it very hard for her to get into a different decent school."
"Following a stupid diet you found online and worrying your boyfriend thinks you're fat doesn't mean you have an eating disorder. If it did, then I've had  one, and so have virtually all my female friends. Some of the male ones, too. "
I thought I misread your ages and your bf was 19. A 29 yr old man doing this? Gross. There's a reason he's dating someone 8 yrs younger. And you're STILL more mature than him.
"Fun fact: Eating disorders can't be *caused* by having someone mention your weight gain, but they can be triggered and worsened by it. I know they can't be 'caught like the flu', but I also know that underlying issues can be worsened by indelicate handling.

Your post history shows that you post on pro-ED and anti-fat subreddits. I think that's a relevant context for your comment."
"Dude you are absolutely making the right choice. It is a tough decision and I'm sure you're second guessing yourself, but I guarantee you will be thanking your lucky stars you made this decision in a couple months or so."
"Actually, quite a lot.  There is a huge suite of legal and social benefits that come with marriage.  That's why the fight for gay marriage is such a big deal.  OP wants to get married, her boyfriend knows it and has *promised* her and now is reneging on that promise.  That's important.  You don't want to spend your life with someone who so casually disregards your needs. "
"Not OP, but can tell you it's a very don't ask don't tell kind of situation. They know it's happening but it kind of takes a back seat."
"In the various Sims games I've been married to: My best friend, my mom, Optimus Prime, my boyfriend, and a humanized version of my dog. Some times I don't put my fiancé in the game cause I know I'll want match us up if he's in it, and I want to see where my ""me"" sim ends up organically.

"Logic has very little to do with healthy communication and fighting in relationships. Fights aren't about who is right and who is wrong. If you view conflicts that way in your relationship, you will break up or be miserable. ""I'm right, you're wrong"" doesn't work in most fights, because both answers can be right. Where should we live? You can have multiple right answers. One of you is not god, the holder of the objective truth, on any issue. 

Empathy has to win. You have to be able to see the viewpoint of the other person and why they feel that way. 

Your fiance's approach is very flawed.

"Why do you keep reposting this? No no no no, the answer is no. Unless you're really interested in being petty and immature, and resetting whatever progress you've made in your recovery from the breakup, this is a stupid idea.

&gt;Part of me wants to shock him and ruin his birthday after what he did to me, but not look crazy or desperate?

Trying to ruin his birthday is crazy and desperate in itself. Leave him alone."
This doesn't matter. You shouldn't cultivate friendships with bad people. She talks to you about it. Does she talk our of guilt? Does she brag?
Thanks for the recommendation. I really don't think it's a mental health issue but I am aware that because of this being personal maybe we don't see it? Do any conditions come to mind for you?  I also don't think he'd agree to see a psychologist at this point and it would probably offend him a lot to mention it. I don't mean to make excuses though.

"As you've already mentioned, this has nothing to do with attraction, so when (yes, WHEN) you have a serious sit down about this, it shouldn't be as hard of a talk as many here wonder about because their SO's weight issues are related to attraction.

This is literally about health.  The biggest problem seems to be he's drinking too much alcohol, so that's a no-brainer.  He needs to cut back A LOT.  2-3 CASES week is completely insane.  That's alcoholism, and he really needs help with that.  

If he's not a picky eater, and is mostly eating a lot when you eat out/get take out, then just make sure you guys aren't doing that frequently.  Spend more time cooking at home, cook together, and continue to have healthy options-ESPECIALLY snack wise (since you mention he's got a late night munchie problem).  "
"Your bf wont move out of his parents house because he wants to save up $10,000 for a TRUCK? What the fuck?

"He needs to stop using your chargers. Period. It would be one thing if he actually returned them in working condition every time, but it sounds like he has lost or broken multiple phone chargers. How is that even possible? I've lost a few over the *years*, but now I do the same thing you do so that I *don't* lose anymore. 

I keep a charger by my bed, at my desk, and in the living room, plus I keep a cable in the car and one in my purse with a battery pack. I kept forgetting to pack a plug each time I traveled, so my husband bought me an extra one that I just keep in my backpack at all times. 

I don't know how he breaks chargers. If he's losing them, maybe he needs a system too of keeping one charger at each place of frequent use. Then he'll stop needing to borrow yours. "

"I guess I'm confused with what you're asking. You were broken up with this girl but continued to sleep with her/be friends with her. She asked to hook up with you one night and you said no, she could find someone else because you were both single. She finds someone else and now you want her back/try to make the relationship work? 

Do you want to date her, or are you jealous that she's trying to move on (like you told her to do)? You have to decide what you want, dude, this is not helpful to either of you."
"That's because you confessed your feelings - after blatantly ignoring every attempt she made at trying to communicate to you that she wasn't interested.  

She clearly knew you were interested, and she was shooting you down left and right, and you just were just trying to bull through it for some reason.  

Eventually find a back door - she forgot to block you somewhere - and try AGAIN.  She's tired of your shit, the fact that you're basically stalking her and not picking up on the most obvious of signals, and she gives you the whatfor.  

Bro, if people aren't interested in you, persistently chasing them is NOT something they're generally good natured about... "

My closest friends and family may drop by to give me something, or to say hi, but they'd never expect to be invited in or entertained unless they called first.

Maybe you need to stop assuming women are crazy, so you can actually stand by your legitimate boundaries and find some friends-who-are-women who aren't so rude and selfish? She doesn't 'have a talent'. She's just rude, and you have had a tolerance for it. "

They're a smart animal and they need constant care and interaction.

"Op, your father is an abusive, addict garbage person. He has abused you (not a little, A LOT), shamed you, taken advantage of you, and neglected you. He has failed you as a parent; don't feel guilty about the money he gave you for school; I guarantee he received way more in the life insurance, and you are due part of that money as your mother's daughter (maybe not legally but morally). I wouldn't be surprised if you were supposed to get some part of it directly and he stole it. He spent many times what he gave you trying to drink himself to death. 

He's unlikely to change, and he's made it clear he doesn't care about you. You don't owe him anything, it's not your responsibility to rescue him from this oubliette he's made for himself. You are not your mother, you didn't pick him, you were stuck with him. I know you feel responsible for him, like she left him to your care when she died. But it doesn't work that way. You see this all as a symptom of grief; he's like this BECAUSE mom died. But this isn't grief; this is him. He was like this before your mom died, but he probably kept it together better when she was around or just hid it better. He didn't care enough to hide it from you. 

You need to move on, and accept you can't fix him. "

"Can you move? That sounds like a dangerous situation and you are an adult now, it would make more sense for you to move than to try and stop this friendship from continuing.

"Woman here. I've read all the comments and  your responses and I've noted, op, that you seem defensive about how you store these pics on your pc. You can set up certain folders not to sync if you don't want them on your computer. Your husband going through the pics? Well if it were my partner, I wouldn't feel angry or insecure. I'd admit the pics shouldn't have been in the computer in the first place. He's a man, he saw a folder that made him curious, and he looked at the pics. I would have done the same! Even if it were one of my partner's friends in the pictures. 

I feel that you are sexually charging this issue as if he were leering or masturbating to them. I don't see that is what happened, as after all, he started out looking for your kid's pics. This isn't the mountain you want to die on. What happened sounds harmless to me. "
"Fun story - I was part of a 5 member group for an English project.

3 out of the 4 other members did not show up on the day of the presentation. The person who did show up didn't do anything for the project. I told her, ""Look, I know you don't know what's going on, so here's what we'll do. I'll take over all the analysis section, and you'll be in charge of summarizing the novel to the class. This way you'll be speaking and get marks too."" She agreed.

During the presentation, I said, ""And now X will summerize the novel,"" and she said, in front of the entire fucking class, ""Oh, I didn't read the novel, so I don't know what it's about, haha."""
"So the person with the username ""MAXIMUM FARTING"" is rigid and uptight? Huh. "
"So, nothing, then? You think you are so much better than other people, but you aren't. 

You have no idea what other people have faced in their lives. How hard they've fought, what the stakes have been. You have no empathy or compassion for others. Seems like your ex made a good decision to take a break from you. "
"I wonder if she worries about her parents' relative lack of social life, thinks your parents ""adopting"" them is a solution, and because this isn't panning out she's getting defensive. Maybe ask her why it's so important for both sets of parents to be friends? Plenty of people just don't click together - you can't force it, and nobody ""owes"" anyone else their friendship. It's not a matter of respect. That said, it clearly is to her, but it isn't to you / your family, and she doesn't get to set the rules of social engagement for other people. "
"Aside from this the whole ""finding herself"" bit is her way of saying that she's not looking for any kind of commitment or attachment right now. It was kind of her to say this up front, and I think it's important for you to respect her wishes, OP. As much as it sucks it sounds like the two of you are just at different points in your lives. "
"He wanted to see you without makeup on... you didn't listen.

He broke up with you... you're not listening still.

Do you care about this guy at all? Truly, unselfishly? No, you don't. You don't listen to what he wants or needs. You lied to him about the makeup. And you're stomping all over his boundaries again by trying to get in contact with him now.

STOP IT. Get help for your rampant insecurities. "

re: your questions

1.  You should really ask your wife.  Hey, this seems really important to you, why?  Why is it so important that our parents be friends?  What would happen if they were cordial and polite but not friends?  Are these your expectations or your parents'?

2. Ask what they think of your inlaws and if they seem fun or interesting to be around.  If they don't give you an answer like ""oh we have been dodging their invites because we hate them"", why not invite both sets of parents over to YOUR house for a sunday roast or bbq or something?  It's probably weird for both sets of parents because the only thing they have in common is you guys.

My parents have only ever been to my IL's home twice.  Once for an engagement party and once for a holiday party.  And my ILs have never been to my parents' home.  Married for 7 years.  Do your wife's friends and family have super close inlaws or something?

"I'd say you need to take this on a conversation by conversation basis. Don't by any means bad talk one parent to the other, but when talking to your mom show the upmost support. When you speak with your father give your upmost support. Even just repeating to either ""I just want you to be happy"" can work out nicely

It's very difficult when your parents divorce. Mine divorced when I was fifteen but unlike you I was quite thankful the whole tumultuous thing was over. It might not be bad idea to seek therapy to get through the issue of your ideal relationship falling apart. The other best advice I can give is take the portions of their relationship you did see and admire and stick with that. As much as I cheered when my parents divorced there were things about their relationship I still find myself wanting in my own relationship. Like my father's patience or my mother's forgiving nature. "
"Honestly, if someone I know would come to me and ask for my opinion on this, I'd tell her to divorce so you won't be saddled with the financial loss that he WILL cause sooner or later. He is not reliable at all and that he's gaslighting her is despicable. He does NOT sound like a person that will ever see the light."
"FWIW there was a certain amount of ""overlap"" with my previous relationship when my SO and I got together. I can justify it up and down with how unhappy I was, but that's not really the point.

It's not a foregone conclusion. "
"I take issue with the word ""knowingly"" here. He could be doing it habitually or instinctively as much as deliberately. Kids can show those parts of their personalities surprisingly early.

"Stop bringing it up, and stop talking about Thailand altogether. If other things are good you can move past it; eventually she'll embrace that you've changed and are a different, and much more mature person now.  

There are things my GF did before me that I think are morally  reprehensive (cheating and never telling her previous partners being the big one). If it were to come up regularly it'd be harder to brush off, but after a few months (since learning that this happened) I've happily embraced that she has changed and is a very different person. 

We all have our baggage  - that's part of life. Howevre, if she can't get over it, or if you can't get over the feeling of her judging you, you should end things. "

"When I struggled to find a good job after college, my dad was really great about saying things that made me feel better about my life choices. He would tell me it made him happy to think of me doing exciting things that he'd never done before (at the time I worked in a bike shop and a vegetarian restaurant). When I started taking drum lessons, he'd tell me it sounded ""really neat"" and would ask me if I'd explored any new places in the city lately. If your son pulls a rickshaw, I'm sure he's had a lot of unusual experiences that you couldn't imagine! If he's not a talker, don't pressure him to share stories, but let him know you think it's cool that he's leading an interesting life and experiencing things unknown to you. That always made me feel good about my life."
"Do you tell your girlfriend about this, and does she do anything about how they speak regarding you?

I understand better why you'd feel put off by them, but you can't change others thinking, only yourself. The ultimate, ""fuck you"" to them is being the best person you can be. You're already doing it right by being polite and respectful to them, despite what they say about you."

He's 36, he is more than old enough to recognize that his behavior is shitty. He just doesn't want to because he doesn't care. If you've tried having discussions about this before and he flat out refuses to even have a conversation about it, there's not much else you can do other than leave. "

Sounds like he's on meth. The mother was probably taken out to the hospital for an overdose or some sort of drug use. People on meth revolve their lives around meth. Be careful to lock up your pawn-able possessions, private info/documents, and any electronics if your dad lets him come over.

Can you get out? As in, move out and live somewhere else, get a job, start a life independently? Maybe you should make plans to, or ask to stay with a relative? 

"
"No, you shouldn't. If anyone should talk to him about it, it should be Jessica. You doing it will likely only make things worse, especially because it's not really your place to do so. Only 6 months into the relationship though, with her school money on the line, I think you should prepare yourself to not get what you want this time. "
If you don't take medication against it he probably has it already. Herpes can be transmitted even without outbreaks through skin-to-skin contact. He needs to to get tested.

"It sounds like Alex has some sort of attachment disorder based on his homelife, which can develop into all sort of issues such as conduct disorder. Which can then turn into a personality disorder later in life. 

If he is getting that manipulative and violent with your son, he definitely shouldn't be allowed in again. Children with these issues have also been known to show violence towards/and or kill animals at young ages. I've studied cases of children with attachment issues and if not treated, the outcome is not good at all. 

Despite him being 8, what you have wrote here gives off major red flags. Him having a parent possibly doing drugs and suffering some sort of abuse at home brings him at a greater risk. I would call CPS and report the issues you've stated. Establish firm boundaries and dont let him inside. 
If he keeps knocking on the door, tell I'm to leave and don't give in.  Over time he should hopefully respect your rules, if not, anything should be reported. Also keep an eye on your dogs... I just don't get a good feeling. Best of luck. "
kick her out of what seems like the mother's house. stop caring for her kids. she's an addict who ignores her kids when the opportunity to do meth crops up. why does she deserve a modicum of trust?
Absolutely. I think this is the only way to make sure they don't come to the hospital during the labor. 
"he went to cover his tracks. that way he can say he's 'getting help' INSTEAD of apologising to you and actually fixing things. his texts show avoidance; possibly he's trying to avoid incriminating himself in writing. if you texted him laying out what he did, when it happened and what injuries he inflicted on you, what do you think his response would be? admittance of guilt plus pictures equal proof for a police report, that's what he's thinking. 

leave him or he'll eventually kill you. he's already given you what sounds like a concussion and those by themselves can be deadly. you could have died last night and you need to get the head injury checked ASAP."
"Oh, girl. I think you know this has nothing to do with the TBI. Let's look back. From the beginning you have a lack of honesty- he hid his drug abuse from you. You have a lack of respect- he moved in with you, a much younger person, knowing he was coming with a huge huge problem and secret. Clearly didn't care about fucking up your life. Then we have financial abuse and stealing from you. Another giant red flag about how he has no respect or love for you. This recent behavior is the same old thing. He's continuing to lie to you about his contact with his ex. He has no respect for your stated boundary. This may be the first time you've confronted him, and so he hurt you. Not once, impulsively. Twice, stopping only when it shut you up. That is intentional. He has had no attacks of rage at his home, or his job. Once he realized what he had done, he went to bed. If this were a true impulse/TBI thing he would have been aghast, appalled at his behavior and would have done anything to help you. It's not. He meant it. It was effective in ending the confrontation and controlling you.

HE FULLY MEANT TO HURT YOU. 

He has been clearly telling you and showing you who he is. Nothing to do with the TBI. 

You deserve so much better. Run, run, run. Consider assault charges to really burn that bridge so you're not tempted to go back across it. I saw in your other comments this is not your first abusive relationship. I am so sorry. You deserve so much more. Get yourself some therapy so you can learn the signs and take care of yourself like you deserve. Best of luck and internet hugs to you. "
"Are you being objective here?? They were together for 3 years! Its been only been several months since her health detoriated. If the relationship last this long and is based on love and respect, it is the most natural thing to care for the partner and not to run away because he or she suddenly became a burden in your life."
"&gt;Sex usually starts with him trying to use my vibrator on me, and then me trying to tell him where to put it and where to put pressure in order to feel good, and then him letting me take over the vibrator, then me feeling bad that he's not being touched so I put the vibrator down and give him oral and then we have sex, **and then after he's done, I go back to my vibrator while he gets on Facebook or watches tv.**

Wow.. sheesh, that's *bad*. I'm glad you included a description of this, because it makes it easier to give some advice!

Okay, sounds like sex starts when you're in the mood. He ""tries"" to help you with the vibrator which counts as doing foreplay for you in his view, but you don't like how he does it so instead you're sexual frustrated by his participation and move on to performing sex *on him* until he's satisfied.. How about switching up foreplay for you?

When a man jerks it, he knows all the right spots that feel good. His woman can provide awesome hand jobs but she won't hit the same spots. Similarly, when you masturbate with the vibrator it's going to be difficult for him to wield it just as good or better than you can. *So what if he does things you can't do for self?*

* **Oral sex** (cunninglingus). What if he goes down on you for awhile? Give him feedback while you have him mouth the alphabet, etc. 

* **Frottage**. He rubs the tip of his member across your lips, clit, etc. You both feel pleasurable sensation.

* **Grinding**. Humping without full penetration while making out.

* **Fingering**. Instead of focusing on ""in and out"" penetration, I would suggest 4:1 ratio of him using his fingers to tease your clit and then teasing the opening of your vagina.

* **Erotic back massauge**. You're naked and lying on your stomach. He's naked and massauges your back while his erect cock is gliding between your legs..

When it comes to PIV, depending on how long he usually lasts have him pull out completely and return to foreplay (oral? fingering?) a couple of times. Interrupt it, so you get a different sensation and he has to build back up his rhythm which makes overall sex more of a build of pleasure for *both of you* instead of simply dividing it as ""her turn-his turn-she finishes herself alone"".

*If he cums before you do, don't let him walk away and watch tv!* New rule is he stays in bed, holds you, strokes your breasts and kisses you while you use your vibrator. But depending on what you like, you work up to phasing out need of the vibrator because you've already climaxed before he did.

Good luck!"

"Holy. Shit. 

She's extremely unflexible, stubborn, and controlling. Absolutely unreasonable.

And honesty, no mentally healthy person in a normal, stable relationship would claim that you taking 2 hours to go to dinner with your mom on mother's day makes her unimportant, or, for that matter, tell you not to come home over it. Even if you guys had these plans well in advance and you changed last minute, yadda yadda. You say this is the second time in two weeks-- why did she do it last time? It seems like she just wants to get her way 100 percent of the time, and maybe she's just looking for a boyfriend that will do that.

There is no reason something like this should have turned into a breakup worthy fight. You guys should not be together.   "
His excuse sounds sketchy to me.
I agree with your agreement. Take engagement off the table.  I am also really wondering what will/would happen if you chose to stay mad or pull back from the relationship.  Girly is gonna flip some tables...
"well viewing from your previous comments and her mom not calling on her birthday, or even bothering to visit because of foster kids. That hurts. I would recommend seeing a therapist, not because she is crazy, but because she is sad. And all her happiness and connection now depends on you. And that is a lot of weight to pull. Justifying of living there only for you, and making her happy and connected. You could ask her if she would be willing to address aforementioned feelings and if you can join or not? It is up to her what is best/more comfortable. She works limited hours, so she has not a lot of things to do. Did she make many new friends? Next, to the limited hours, does she have any hobbies? Any way to spend time that is not dependent on you? Dude, you have a lot of weight to carry. I understand her perspective, but it must be really heavy lifting for you as well. "
It is probably a parent plus loan.  Only the parent is liable for this type of student loan.
"I once went to an ombudsman for a serious issue (a year off school mandated for something very much not my fault). They listened to my outrage right up until they heard my faculty was engineering, and then just immediately dismissed me with a ""yeah we don't really mess with those guys.""

Barely needs to be said but this university has a perversely subservient relationship with their very own money-faculty."
"So you aren't in the wrong, but you need to take this VERY seriously. 

Go to the school administration or principal and explain to them what happened. Tell them you wanted to inform them yourself to avoid any implications of impropriety and to make sure this is handled appropriately. Hopefully they have concrete suggestions for you. 

I would also see if you could get another teacher (this student's homeroom teacher or the English teacher or even the principal) to approach her privately and explain why what she did was inappropriate. First of all, it will help make sure she doesn't have any false hope. Second, what she did IS inappropriate. In any other setting, ambushing someone with a declaration of love in front of their partner would be considered incredibly rude. Sure, she gets a pass because she is a teenager, but she should still learn why what she did was wrong.  "
"Or as Ron Swanson says, ""Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.""  Whatever you're doing at that time, make it a 100% effort.

I've used this on my husband as well.  Like, I get you want to do a project and that's fine, but the project isn't done until it's finished and you've put away your tools and cleaned up your stuff.  You are a grown-ass man and I should not have to hold your hand, basically!"

..or you dated an ex-army drunk who makes up stories to get men?

&gt;A breakup does not happen after one fight!

Yes it does.  All the fucking time.  Especially three months into a relationship with someone delusional.

Run."
"I gave my advisor the names of the 2 problem-makers and described why they were problematic, but she didn't seem to care that much, at least based on how she sounded over the phone. Her attitude was more like, ""Oh, OK, I understand you have a problem, why don't I give you a little more time to work on the paper and get back to me when you have your shit together."" So I'm not sure how much support I'd get if I tried to run this up the flagpole."
"So...you married a compulsive liar and now you're upset he's lying to you?

 I'm not sure what you want Reddit to tell you. He's a liar and he lies to you. You don't get to change him, you only get to decide if you want to stay with him or not. "
"No, not really. But I do think the person who is reporting all of this is acting like somebody who doesn't want to be in a relationship anymore. "
"Nope. In the real world, results are what matter. We both know what kind of results that idea would've gotten 7 years ago. And it's not even difficult to grasp that there'd be a very poor response to such a venture. I don't underestimate stupidity, but in marketing, money talks. They wouldn't get the real world equivalent of a B for that idea; they'd get poor yearly reviews. Unless of course they managed to get to the top management level and then I guess they'd get a multi-million dollar bonus while they fleeced the company and then left it high and dry in a couple years xD.

Lucky for me, I wasn't a marketing or management major. I just took the class for fun as an elective. I never had to work with any of those tools. "
"Gonna throw it out there, looking at your posts and replies you certainly don't talk like you're on his side. From your posts you really make it seem like you've chosen your mother and want to justify it and that your husband is in the wrong tbh."
"No steady job, living with your parents, pursuing your education. People too often see these things in a negative light, but no drama here, simply the indication of transition you are going through in life as you prepare for bigger things.

But they are good reasons not to get married yet.

These are not ultimately obstacles. But you have only been with her for a year and she's already seeking that lifelong commitment. You're not ready, she's not ready. She's moving so fast and somehow expects you to keep pace? No, that's not how these things work. Drag your heels if you must!

But as for something to say? That's harder. If she's at the point of getting upset with you simply for not being ready, will anything you say have much effect? That's an unreasonable expectation, let's call it what it is. When you finish your degree, get set with a career, actually establish yourself, no question you'll be ready then. Push it now, and you throw so much tension of marriage and marriage preparation into your schooling and jeopardize your education again. Don't go there. Besides, ""making it work"" is just a euphemism for blindly feeling your way, and wholly ignores your situations.

You love her madly, but keep your eyes open. Understand that she may try stronger tactics. She's been a bit manipulative about it already. She doesn't need to get married now any more than you do. It's not a need. It's a wish on her part, one that doesn't take reality into account. It's an outside chance, but if she pulls the nuclear option be prepared for it. Know what you'll do if she demands you get married immediately or it's over. You want to pursue this relationship, but can't do it wholly on her terms.
"
"&gt;Being that she is born again we haven't had sex yet because we want to wait until marriage, but she HAS slept with multiple people long before giving up her past to start her new life. Obviously this is intimidating for me.

Either she's withholding something from you or you're both wanting to share something you've built up in your minds as special until your wedding night, which was YOUR CHOICE as above.

You can't play it both ways."
"&gt; If your school has a counselor I would take advantage of that. They will know how to help.

Meh. Maybe. It's worth checking out. In my personal experience high school counselors are:

* 20% of the time overworked beyond all belief
* 20% of the time are incompetent beyond all human comprehension
* 20% of the time trying to deal with ""real"" problems like violence, abuse, pregnancy, addiction.
* 39.9999% of the time are all of the above
* 0.0001% able to help with ""ordinary"" problems like issues with teachers, parents, or classes.

I'm not advising OP to not try, but I am concerned that OP may experience more of the same kind of behavior from school counselors."

Well ultimately this is entirely on your mother. Why she didn't just book a bigger place or invite you along for no charge when they booked this place is beyond me. Your position is reasonable and you made it clear to her early enough for her to prepare. Don't let her emotionally blackmail you into doing what she wants. 
"My husband and I did two years of long distance while he went to a grad school about 1,000 miles away and in a different time zone. We had been together for three years and I was terrified about losing him (especially since I had my sights set on him since 6th grade!) and thought for sure this would be our death sentence. 

We had a lot of talks about our plans for the future.  I wasn't going to let him go without some kind of commitment. Eventually, we agreed that he would go and complete Grad school -- and we'd see each other only every few months -- but once he was done, he'd come home and we'd get married.  Ten years later, we spend all of our time together and we're stronger because of our time apart: I know I can live without him, but  my preferred state is as close to him as I can get.  

It comes down to goals and open communication - what are both of your goals for this relationship? If you want to spend your life with this girl, what's 18 months of long distance? If you both want it, long distance sucks but it doesn't mean you're doomed to break up.  

If you do end up doing long distance, be sure you set your communication expectations -- do you want to talk by phone every day? Twice a week? Text every day with a once a week Skype call?  Set these expectations before she leaves. It's strategies like that that prevent the kinds of misunderstanding that are a pain to solve from a distance. 

Just my perspective.  Good luck, OP!"
"I'd offer her $150 and go on the vacation. That's $600 divided by 8 people, times 2 (you and your husband.) That's more than fair. (Actually, pretty generous given the circumstances) they need to start getting a bigger rental! I live in a beach town and there are plenty of large houses. They cost more, but if 8 people can start chipping in, it's doable."
You abandoned your daughter at a traumatic time and now you are treating her like a possession.  You are the one causing the problem - not your ex wife.
"YES! He needs the wake-up call that he is very close to being fired and has been reported multiple times. Surely he's not aware of that, and the info might scare him into behaving."
"There is no mocking. You, yourself, in another comment say things are FINALLY looking up and you want to destroy all them again. The irony in that statement juxtaposed to this thread is palpable. "
"But what if at some point Cary was like ""hey Ryan, does OP mind that we cuddle"" and he's like ""no, she hasn't said anything, it's fine"". I am more inclined to blame the boyfriend than the other girl, cuz other girl doesn't seem like she's trying to be a homewrecker. And if it's a boundaries issue, BF should be putting those in place to respect his relationship, because ultimately OP's in a relationship with him, not his BFF."
"He *is* definitely being manipulative but he might not be doing it evil calculatingly on purpose. He might not realise how unhealthy it is, or that his feelings of hurt are stemming from super low self esteem and a skewed view of what a loving relationship looks like.

If OP can get him to look at himself, learn about what he's doing and why,  understand how it affects her (and everyone in his life), and decide he needs help, yay. But it's on him not the OP and she shouldn't stay with someone who continues this way.
"
"You didn't explain anything about the friend other than you talk to her.  What is the dynamic there?  Is she reasonable in this?  EG do you text her all the time, do you flirt, do you hang out together, have you been gushing to your gf about how great Camila is?  

It's possible you've crossed some lines without knowing it, but for the most part these issues are usually caused by insecurity on your girlfriend's part.  "

"She's right, everyone in the world is wrong except her.  Go find one of those people."
I mean.. How fast would SHE break up with you if she found out you had a one night stand behind her back?
[removed]
"Where is the money coming from for these trips and how much do they (honestly) cost on average? Thousands, I would imagine. Do you make significantly more than her?

If you have all of this disposable income for trips, she should either be taking unpaid leave to join you, or the two of you should go all-out for the two weeks of vacation she's afforded and you should do small trips with your friends. And/or consider using some of your vacation time to add to your lives, doing work around the house, getting things taken care of that are easier done during the day on weekdays and then spending the remainder of that day drinking beers and dicking around.

It seems like an unpopular opinion, but I think it's unfair that you get to use your (presumably, as you're married) joint funds to finance elaborate trips while your wife is working. A few days somewhere in the country, sure, that's reasonable. Two weeks twice a year, international travel? Not cool."
No. Just this. 
I don't think that is feasible at all. Indian weddings are huge events and divorce is even worse. 
"People can argue this isn't technically cheating. It's completely irrelevant how you want to call it. I wouldn't want to be with someone who after a date with me coldly went and had sex with another person. Same views on fidelity are very important to some of us, and not something we want to have to ask for. "
"Word. My dad watched his dad beat his mom his whole life, so it seemed natural for him to hit my mom. He never touched any of us, though. In fact, when my mom left him I never saw his angry drunk side again. Just the quixotic drunk side, of crying one minute and making my siblings (5 and 3) cry, then snapping out of it and wanting to go drive to get ice cream a minute later. I (7) was always the bad guy when I refused to let us get in the car. 

It's interesting though how different people rationalize their behavior differently. "
"OP... you know this isn't ok. 

There's only one solution here."
"&gt; they have NO EXCUSE for being garbage people.

 They really are too, no concern whatsoever and then to respond with, ""then they remembered he was my fiance and her my best friend and had a rather abrupt oh shit moment."" Seriously, what kind of person says that, a garbage person!"

"I'm so sorry you're in this situation. You've just had the rug pulled out from under you and I can't imagine how you're feeling right now, but I promise you'll look back on this relationship in a few years' time and be thankful you came to this realisation before things got more serious between you. He's not worthy of your time and love, believe me.

Stay strong, OP; you're going to be ok."
Someone who's willing to do that over you (out of jealousy) is most certainly willing to do it to you. Please stay away from both of these dudes.
"&gt; But when I was around 12? he touched me inappropriately on 3-4 different occasions while he thought I was asleep. 

WHAAAAAA? NO, you don't have to let this go bc he ""saved"" you! He didn't save you, anyway. Without him, there could have been someone else or a different circumstance. He doesn't get to hold that over your heads.

Anyway, he sexually abused you! There is no possible thing that he can do that would justify ignoring this! I don't care if he rescued a bunch of nuns and orphans from a burning bus, he doesn't get a pass for sexual abuse! There is no amount of exclamation marks that I can use to  adequately emphasize this point!

Let your step father get mad. Let your brother disown you. They are both bad people."
"You're not missing it. You're going. You will regret it immensely if you do.

It will be hard, probably one of the hardest things you do in your life, but if you do not go then you are not only dishonoring your grandpa but also probably closing the possibility of ever being close to that side of the family again. You're not going there to reinsert yourself, you're going for your grandpa's memory. 

You need to go."
"Ugh I hate this. I wouldn't want to have to give someone an ultimatum to marry me.. I'd want them to do it because they want to not because I forced them.

Edit: why is this getting downvoted? How many of you had to give an ultimatum to have someone marry you!?  "
"You ARE in two different stages of your life, however. He's a mid-level professional, you're about to graduate college and start a career. Work demands will be different for both of you, as well as overall general life goals. Are y'all on the same page about kids? Finances? Future? A 32 year old is probably a little more concerned about those issues than a 21 year old. 

That aside, if his company is in some sort of turmoil, it's very likely that you've never experienced the amount of stress he's under. As a professional, I'm more stressed out regularly than I ever was as a college student -- even when I thought writing my senior thesis was the most stressful thing of my life. Stress is a hell of a drug. It's entirely possible that once the turmoil dies down at work he could go right back to normal. Or not. "
Because there's a reason THIS guy is dating a younger girl. Correlation does not mean causation. Some older dudes date younger girls because no one else will put up with their shit. But that doesnt mean every older dude dating someone younger is like that. 
"&gt; For the others, this phrase: 'I am not responsible for the poor choices other people have made.' Repeat as necessary.

I'm going to go against the grain and just suggest not even engaging with these people in the near future.  They're all grieving, too, and they're looking for SOMEONE to blame.  OP is the easy target.  None of this is his fault.  Hell, it's entirely possible friend dies sooner if OP never gives him a place to stay in the first place.

OP doesn't have anyone to grieve with because they've all turned on him-so yeah, therapy/counseling is a given here, but for the time being, I personally wouldn't recommend having anything to do with ANYONE who blames him for these circumstances.  They're hurting but that doesn't excuse them blaming OP, but when emotions are running high, he's not going to be able to reason with them.  "
"Seriously, husband is clearly saying some really bad shit when OP isn't around to hear it."
It sounds like he has some unspoken hang-ups with the way he views gender-relations. I would suggest that the next time he brings this up you ask him why it bother him so much. Getting to the root issue would be helpful.
"Have you asked him to stop?  Dad, I know you love to flirt, but I have a request, please don't do it when we're together, it makes me uncomfortable.  If he says no, then you have a choice, to either endure his bad behavior or only see him privately.  "

"Wow, that's a tough one! Sorry that you're going through this.  

First: I'd like to point out the possibility of an annulment.  I'm under the impression that this is a clean/fast way of dissolving the marriage and basically says that the wedding didn't happen, saving you from having to go through proceedings associated with divorce.

Next: I'm sure that in this thread you will receive advice mainly saying to dump him ASAP.  That advice will be based on each commenter's own criteria for breaking up.  What I advise you to do is spend time, however long you need, to decide for yourself what is your criteria.  

Lastly:  My personal criteria would dictate that this is an irreparable offense by both parties.  I understand that there are instances in life where a man and a woman make a mistake, only to become aware immediately after that it was wrong to have done so.  Then there is an understanding of that mistake and a lesson learned to never make it again.  Sometimes the cheating is indicative of what more to expect in the future.  What you need to decide is whether the mistake will be only his cheating, or will it include having gotten married to this man.  As far as your friend goes, you need to also decide if she meets the friend criteria.  Do you think this behavior is something you can accept in a confidant? Many will agree, neither of these two respect you enough to not keep it in their pants. For those with self esteem, that is enough to cut them out of their lives forever. "
"To be honest, I think it will be hard to address her addiction without first addressing the developmental/social delay. It's quite possible she's feeling depressed because of them (being different can quite isolating and lonely) and overcoming addiction when you're depressed is super hard. If she gets the support she needs, she just might feel happier and more confident in addressing her addiction. "
Crushing on a boyband isn't that big of a deal as long as she doesn't try to contact them.
I'm not really sure that what your brother names his son is any of your business! And he has just as much a right to your father's names as you do.

If it's her parenting style, it's wrong in so many ways. Growing up in this environment can't be healthy. Do you know how Daddy is parenting? Is he loving, caring, plays with the baby, talks in a nice voice?

I was very young when I had my kids and I never talked to them like this. I wanted them, I wanted to give them a loving home where they feel safe so they can grow up to happy and confident adults. This is how i wished I had grown up. "
"&gt;  He is callous and selfish enough and having a good time while it lasts.

"This is sexual harassment. A lot of people miss this because the target is a male, but sexualizing people without their knowledge is not ok. I suspect these girls don't even realize it's harassment, but ask them to imagine this scenario with the genders flipped and they'd be shocked and horrified. Report this to the dean of students. All the participants in this group need a stern lecture, their parents called, and probably some sort of warning/probation. Do *not* confront them yourself or I imagine they'll think of it as a joke gone too far and not criminal behaviour. I'm sorry you experienced this."

"A few things here. I'll be blunt, but I'm not trying to be insulting. 

One, it was inappropriate of her to go into detail. There is no reason at all for her to go into graphic detail. It's also inappropriate for you to ask who her past partners are. Her past is her past and she is under no obligation to disclose their names and other things to you. This entire conversations was just not handled well. 

But this:

&gt;I liked it when she was all mine, but now she isn't and never will be I guess.

This is unhealthy.  She doesn't belong to you, her sexuality doesn't belong to you, her past doesn't belong to you. I am confused by the ""never will be."" She had a past before she was with you, which you later state doesn't bother you, but now you are holding it against her? It's a bit contradictory. 

&gt;Hopefully I don't come across as too much cringelord, rather an emotionally immature boy who doesn't know what to think or feel

I think that's fairly accurate. It is normal to be bothered by someone telling you graphic details of their past, but I do think you are taking it to far with the ""Now she isn't all mine"" and changing how you feel about her when you look at her. It's an overreaction. 

&gt; I don't mind that she has a past, we all do, I just didn't want to hear about the details.

This is a fair statement. 

&gt;I'm bothered when she tells me that she enjoyed it and its a shame it didn't turn into more than a one nighter

It's also honest of her, though. She had feelings for someone before you were together. That's normal and human. She has enjoyed sex before you. This is normal and human. Going into detail about it sounds like she has some maturing to do emotionally. You are both 20. You will both make mistakes. You will both mature, hopefully together. 

Sit down and talk. Don't make her feel bad, don't shame her for enjoying the past, ect. She has no reason to feel bad about that. She has apologized for sharing details, so explain your boundary on that. 

She was inappropriate to go into detail but you are overreacting, which is making you be inappropriate. Sit down, accept her apology, apologize to her, and discuss how to handle future conversations. She did nothing wrong having a past and enjoying her past. You are not wrong to not want to hear the intimate parts, but you are wrong to hold it against her for enjoying something and are wrong for considering her ""all"" yours. You need to see her as her own person, who makes her own choices, who has decided to share her life with you, and with it, parts of herself, the same as you. Emotional maturity comes with time and grows with how you handle situations. 

You are both still young, still learning and still exploring who you are. Work together on boundaries, understanding, respect and communication. 

**Edit**: Added bits and pieces. 

**Edit to your second edit, because apparently my comment isn't long enough yet**:

&gt;A lot of you seem to misunderstand when say I want her to be all mine, I mean sexually and romantically.

Monogamy doesn't mean someone belongs to you. But it is something that 20 year old seem to think. There is a difference between putting someone on a pedestal and claiming them rather than recognizing independence with trust and loyalty. 

But this is what people are talking about:

&gt;I liked it when she was all mine, but now she isn't and never will be I guess. 

This is the toxic mindset that people are pointing out to you. She was never all yours. She is her. She had a past before you. She's liked and loved and sexually enjoyed people before you. That fact that you think this means she isn't ""yours"" anymore is an alarming mindset. Instead of blowing it off and letting your age show, think about it for a while, reflect, and use what you learn as a way to grow. Consider why you would not longer hold her in the same light. Consider why knowing she has a past -just like you have a past- somehow makes her less now. Think about it. And examine if your viewpoint is rational, fair, or holds a double standard.

"EDIT: This was OP's reply to me on a post

&gt; I stayed the night, showered in the morning, she was awake and even told me where she kept her towels. We talked a bit that next morning after my shower then I took off for work. I dont buy she doesn't remember.

It's embarrassment, plain and simple, and she chose a childish way to go about it.


&gt; It makes no sense to me sense for her to have concocted an elaborate scheme of not remembering just to mess with OP.

What? I never said it was to mess with OP. I said she could be embarrassed about it and might have decided that deny, deny, deny, or at least playing it off like she doesn't remember, might be the most effective response. Maybe she's worried he'd tell someone in the friend group? 


Like I said, I'm not saying she definitely lied to OP, but I'd give that a better chance than the opposite... again, just my opinion. Especially since they finished drinking, he THEN helped her clean up, which she remembers, implying she wasn't blacked out at that point. She also ""remembers going to bed alone,"" which is quite literally impossible, since that isn't what happened. Plus, her going to bed is *after* she asked OP to stay, so if she remembered the events directly before *and* after she asked OP to stay, how does she not remember that?



Like I said, you're correct in that there's a chance she really doesn't remember."
"I think that at the very least you should email it to yourself (a bit like this post but with more detail) so that you have a contemporaneous record of who did what, what dates, etc.

"Breastfeeding. Had too make milk. So I had to eat. Everytime I dieted I would start my period and my milk supply would tank. After consulting with my obgyn and lactation nurses and 3 periods in 6 weeks, it was best for me not to cut back on calories.

Also sleep and hormones have a big effect on weight loss. Two things that a postpartum mom has very little control over. I wasn't getting sleep. I had to eat to maintain my milk supply. Hormones we're crazy. The only thing I found optional was working out. I eventually did stop breastfeeding because of antibiotics. "
"In some cultures it's a religious thing, in others it's a commitment. If you don't want to make that commitment then that's fine, and as you say it's up to her whether she wants to stay with someone who won't get married.

Same with kids; some people are in relationships where one wants a kid and the other doesn't and a decision has to be made. That said, a kid is a bigger issue. This is just about your insecurities regarding your personal possessions.

From her point of view, she feels you're more concerned about your money and material values than her feelings."
"I understand your point, and I agree for the most part.

I think my reluctance and annoyance stems from being... ehh how do I word this... removed from the decision-making process? Or having the choice or option handled for me? It's an ego-harmer.

Not to mention, I'll have to pay for the things she picks out, hahaha.

Thanks for replying."
"Your girlfriend is allowed to be offended that you let a girl you were romantically involved with kiss you while she was standing right there, and you are allowed to think that a kiss on the cheek from an old friend who you dated in middle school and is currently dating someone else who was also standing right there is an appropriate greeting.  I don't understand why all of these other comments are so black and white that you are in the wrong.

I think the childish reaction from your friends was the real impetus for this, though.  Do you think your girlfriend feels like they are ""our"" friends or are they definitely still ""your"" friends?  If they are ""your"" friends, I can promise you that she *did not* ""have a good laugh"" about that.  That was a joke from people she barely knows about her boyfriend cheating.  "
Talk to your therapist about this too.
But you used him to cheat. That makes him feel like shit. 
"Hi OP, I don't think that's a sign it's over. You don't know (unless you just didn't mention it) under what circumstances and with what tone she told that to her friend. She may have just had a passing moment of doubt that is not indicative of any deeper problems between the two of you. If she hasn't given you any indication that she feels any differently than the very effusive praise she *has* demonstrated directly to you, I don't think you necessarily have anything to worry about here. 

Given how forthcoming she has been with you (and I recognize this may be a stretch), I wonder if there's a way to interpret her comment in such a way where she *does* love you tremendously but feels like she struggles with finding the adequate way to express that to you sometimes. I'm just trying to throw out some possibilities that will help you see this from a few different angles, without knowing more about this specific situation. 

Does any of this resonate with you? 

Also, how well do you know this friend and how trustworthy do you think he is?

Finally, if the comment still bothers you after you've reflected on it some more, I'd suggest finding a way to bring it up to her. This might sound like, ""So and so told me this. That confuses me because you seem to feel strongly about me. Can you clarify?"" "

You are over the top about this.  You say you desperately want to save the friendship and in the next breath you want to ruin her relationship and get her fired.  Those things don't line up.  You either want her friendship or hate her and want to hurt her.  Which is it?  Cancelling an outing isn't great but you are way too butt hurt about it.  You wrote about this before and months later you are still upset about cancelling a movie outing.

"The easy solution is let him read what you just wrote. It gives all the background and the fact that at the time you were indeed angry (which is something he wants), but his honesty in the texts allowed you to still trust him.

"I don't think this is fair.  IMO, if a partner breaks your trust in some way, it's fair to have some sort of restrictions in place for a little while so you can work on your relationship and rebuild that trust, but if things are at the point where your husband feels you can never interact with men in an appropriate way again and won't trust you to do that, he should break things off.  I wouldn't want to be him, so worried about you cheating that he can't stand you having male friends; and I wouldn't want to be you, either, the object of this mistrust that is likely no longer warranted.

Have you ever talked to your husband about this?  I feel like I'd ask him straight up if he trusts you around men.  If he says yes, then I think he should trust you to be friends with guys.  If he says no, I'd be wondering why he even wants to be with you.

EDIT: my comment is assuming that you two have already done the work of moving past your indiscretion - discussing why you acted the way you did, you coming to an understanding that you were wrong and shouldn't flirt with people while in a relationship, etc. - and that the ""no guy friends"" rule isn't just a Band Aid covering up larger problems.  If that's not the case, you need to do the work to rebuild trust."
This is pretty much exactly the way some girls have been lured to be wives of isis fighters. As soon as they get into a muslim country they lose all rights. If she is super serious about it she should get him to come to your city and get him to at least meet you and yojr father.

"&gt;I guess I think you should trust him. Like you do any other adult. Stop assuming that he has a problem when he doesn't do what you want or expect. Ask him about himself instead of telling him about himself.

This applies to the relationship I have with my mum pretty perfectly. Every time I visit she will always make very direct comments and assumptions about my life. Each interaction makes me dread the next one even more. I have told her countless times how I feel about her comments and that I am happy doing what I am doing but it never changes. It has gotten to the point that my mind completely shuts down and out of the conversation almost the instant she starts speaking. I am expecting negativity. 

As of right now, I haven't spoken to her in a few months (blocked her number also) and it just feels so good not expecting my phone to flash up a passive aggressive, emotionally manipulative or just downright insulting text just because I haven't texted or seen her in a while."
"I guess it's a matter of perspective. I think 22-29 is a much bigger age difference than 17-22. True the 17 year old brain isn't fully developed but a person at 22 is just entering the world and should be looking forward to making new memories and new experiences with new people. I was a MUCH different person at 22 than I am at 32 and that's due to living in the real world for a decade.  Anyway why doesn't your fiancé like women his own age? And what happens when you turn 30 and no longer look like a woman in her early 20s? Are you freaking out about the other age difference because you are really wondering if he's capable of committing to a woman to ""grow old with"" when he has a pattern of chasing much younger women? "
"Um... Why do you bet it's only legal 16 years olds to sleep with someone under 20? In Canada and many other countries, 16 is the age of consent full stop. Like they could sleep with an 80 year old and nobody would get arrested. "

"You sound like a pretty good deal.  You're a maid who pays him and puts out!

If you think someone is using you, then stop doing his laundry and cooking for him, duh.

Have an adult conversation.  Make a damn chore chart if you have to.  This guy is 30 and needs to grow up.  Be very clear how serious you are.  If he doesn't want to pitch in, he can hire a maid.

That said, he is 30, and I wouldn't expect him to change, especially with how disrespectful he is to everything you do.  Is this really what you want to be married to?  Someone who is stingy with his money and lets you do all the work?"
"She's going to need to put her big-girl pants on and be firm with her father about getting a statement. She is 31 and should know where her investments are. If I were her, I would approach it from a ""I am doing a portfolio review of my accounts with my financial advisor and he wants to see a statement of all my investments"". If her father just thinks its better for him to manage the account, then maybe that line of thinking would persuade him to relent some control. If he still doesn't budge, I think she can start to assume there are more nefarious reasons for his secretiveness and she should be more aggressive."
"It doesn't matter if it's a bird, cat, dog, or whatever.  What matters is that it's totally undisciplined, and has never been trained.  She has treated it like a baby, and given it unlimited freedom, and I don't think you can fix that, since she's disinclined to.  Keep in mind that how she handles the bird is likely to be how she handles children.

I wouldn't open a window.  The bird doesn't realize it's being a jerk.  It's just doing it's untrained bird thing.

But, that said, I think that in a healthy relationship, you should each come first with the other.  You are playing second fiddle to a bird.  I think that once you're in a relationship with someone more sensible, you'll be glad you got out."
"OP, you're completely entangled and enmeshed in whatever his issues are. Bottom line is that his reckless behavior is putting you in harm's way (what if one of his friends decided to come up to your bedroom after everyone else had left?) emotionally and psychologically.  You're preventing him from experiencing the fallout from his actions by being there, making dinner, paying bills, and checking up on him. None of this is good for you, and right now nobody has *your* back.

He also doesn't want to change, at all, right now.

If the roles were reversed, how long do you think he would have tolerated this behavior from you?"

There's no need for the huge narrative you just gave us. Just say ""no, that isn't going to happen at my house."" That's it. "
"Honestly, I think you did the right thing. You're going to miss him. Spending four years with someone and then being completely isolated from them is hard, but if marriage is not something that you can sacrifice for the sake of being with him, then there would be no point to stay. 
You both agreed upon the fact that you would propose, then marry at a set time, etc. And he did not follow through as planned, that is a waste of your time, and is not fair to you as you could have spent it finding someone who would have been more invested and mutually decided on marriage. 

If he were to propose now, it would not be genuine IMO. It would be more of an attempt to get you back and less than a genuine want to marry you. Thing is : He had all those years and then some to do this when you were together, but he did not. Now that you are gone he is valuing you more than he did when you were together, and that is not a good thing, it means he'd have taken you for granted and now would want you back so he can feel comfortable again. The issue is that he may just take you for granted again if you were to say yes later down the road, and be generally shitty at keeping promises, deals, etc.

"&gt;  People change their mind or feel different.

Then he should have said this out loud like an adult instead of continuing to agree with her and insisting he was going to do it.

&gt;  maybe these agreements were said without thinking it was a binding contract?

If you have serious relationship discussions, repeated multiple times, about serious life and relationship milestones, and then come away thinking ""Well yeah but I mean she probably didn't mean it all that strongly, just like a vague approximation, right?"" then you have more serious issues that I know how to describe.

&gt; Do you want to tell your grandkids/friends you got engaged because ""well, we dated for three years and then on the deadline day he popped the question""???

Seems better than ""Why aren't nanny and granda married?"" ""Well kids, nanny has always wanted to get married, for the last 40 years, and granda says he definitely will some day, so maybe he will soon!""

Also everyone here constantly talks about how important it is to communicate with your partner when you want something... but for some reason marriage is some exception where we're supposed to feel grateful that he's willing to be anywhere near us and we aren't allowed to have our own desires even if we communicate them clearly and openly compromise multiple times?"
"I went through something eerily similar a few months ago. Cute dude I was attracted to had been dating one of my friends and he told me they'd broken up. He took me home from a party. I was pretty pleased with myself. 

The next week I go in and she pulls me aside and asks if I knew that she and her ex were not entirely all the way broken up and if I knew that she had asked him not to sleep with any of her friends until they were emotionally done. Oops. I didn't know. We talked it out and it was fine. We're still friends. 

You need to talk it out with Sadie. She might be really angry at first, and you will have to accept that (even though what happened really isn't your fault). Ideally you and her will both come to direct the full force of your anger at her shitty cheating (ex) boyfriend."
"&gt; Why dont you start by giving options in your questions

My guess is because the answer is still the same...

&gt; ""do you want to go out, or do you want to stay in""

I dunno.

I'd start not giving options, but leaving an opt-out clause that requires an affirmative response (rather than just a passive I dunno).  Something like, 'unless you have any objections, let's go and do &lt;some activity you want to do&gt; this weekend'.

Likewise with sex, change the way you approach it so that asking for consent doesn't end up with ""if you want to, go ahead""."
You should consult a lawyer. You shouldn't stay in this marriage a day longer than you have to.
"Ok, then part of a real apology would be acknowledging that you have a drug problem (&amp; believe me, if it takes up enough of your money that you start stealing Gran's money to pay for it, then it's a problem) &amp; finding a support group to join so you can work toward sobriety.

""Sorry I did it"" is only part of an apology. If you can't also offer the ""And this is what I'm doing so it won't happen again"" then it's kind of a hollow apology. "

"Exactly this. You don't owe him your ""training"" to make him able to fulfil your emotional needs. And ""its just the way he is"" isn't a valid argument either - plenty of people are total assholes, and ""its just the way he is"" doesn't cut it for them!

"**Taxes and having no plans to move back to the US are not good enough reasons to give up her citizenship alone**- especially since her foreign-earned income, up to $100k plus, would be exempt from US taxes. I had a big reduction on my Dutch taxes just because they knew I was also paying US taxes. I'm not 100% sure where it all balanced out, but I was not losing a ton of money through double taxation- I was still putting money away for retirement and in my savings account.

Citizenship is not like residency where you can just give it up and apply for a new one as life goes on. It takes a lot of work and commitment (ex: applying for Dutch citizenship is at least like a year long process, requiring language and cultural examinations). And giving up your US citizenship is no easy thing either- it costs money, time, and a lot of paperwork. You really need to think long and hard before starting into this process.

Also, there are way more benefits to being an American citizen, even while living abroad, that she would lose. There is no guarantee that another country could offer those on par with the US- especially Russia. **Please talk to some tax, citizenship, and immigration lawyers (in the US at least, but maybe also in France and in Russia) with your daughter before she does this!!**"
"she's being inflexible because she did exactly what you wanted (got hobbies; stopped nagging) and worked on meeting you half way. but when it comes to the miscarriage, you aren't meeting her half way. you're being inflexible about how quickly she should get over this, i.e.: ""we hit a very rough patch back in january, but i thought we were over it."" 

also, family stuff is NOT time spent with her, too--especially if you expect her to rearrange her schedule for impromptu visits that feature your pregnant sister. when your family comes to visit do they even ask your wife how she is doing? are they being as repressed about the miscarriage as you are?

I think when you're flippant towards body image it just becomes harder to understand why getting a procedure done is important and getting one just sounds really extreme. That's why he's asking you to look at therapy. For him it just doesn't seem like a healthy or normal reaction to a body flaw because he can easily shrug his own imperfections off. Maybe a superficial part of him is concerned he won't be attracted to you anymore if the change is too drastic.


Even though my views are more in line with your boyfriends because I'm an impartial viewer I do think the nose job will probably be beneficial for you. This is something you've thought about since your were ten. I don't think you will be able to make peace with it especially since the procedure is so accessable and everyone and their uncle is getting it done."
"Finances are so relative, Achieving your goals and seeing your current lifestyle versus the fantasy you had in your head can be difficult.

Instead of talking to your wife about numbers, perhaps talk to her about what kind of lifestyle she wants to see to feel secure (x amount of days off, a savings account of x amount, etc). I'd also urge her to address her anxiety as well - it seems like she's taking the loss of income from her job switch very hard, and it's contributing to sense of loss of lifestyle she thought she'd have right now.

"So first off, a slight caveat: the native and foreign languages need to be sufficiently different in their rhythmic properties for newborns to distinguish between them^1. So, for example, newborns aren't able to distinguish between English and Dutch (although they can by the age of 5 months^2). But they are able to distinguish between, say, French and English, or English and Japanese^3.

These kinds of experiments are logistically pretty difficult to pull off. You need to get mother and newborn in the lab, and it's hard to get lots of subjects (it's not on the top of most new mothers' priority lists!) and practically speaking, at least half the subjects you manage to get in will not complete the experiment due to crying, sleeping, etc. So the earliest we have conclusive proof for is 4 days old. At 4 days old, we know for sure that infants can distinguish between languages with different rhythmic properties ^1^, ^3^, ^4^, ^5

However, we also know that the language input received by infants in the womb has a direct effect on perception after birth ^6^, ^7. So it's reasonable to assume that the results found for 4-day old infants are also true for full newborns - it's just logistically impractical to test them before they're out of the hospital.

I would consider reframing the conversation.

* When you make promises, you keep them. You're not going to promise something before you're able.
* If you buy a ring/promise ""forever"" before you're ready, she's going to doubt that you're doing it because you truly want to and will resent it.
* If you buy a ring/promise ""forever"" before you're ready, you're going to resent it.
* Constant arguments about your readiness for marriage increase your anxiety and decrease your comfort in the relationship.
* You guys need time to establish roots before you make that commitment. If the soil's too shallow, you won't survive the storms ahead. Her constant pressure to get married (4 months in!) is eroding that soil. Give yourselves time to ""bloom"" (she sounds like someone who likes metaphors)."

"This is a frequently repeated question in this sub. No, you didn't cheat or do anything wrong by ""the rules."" You didn't have an agreement of a relationship or exclusivity to cheat on. But human being's feelings don't work according to strict rules, and a lot of people would feel hurt that at a time when they felt they were building a connection, becoming more intimate, and heading toward a relationship, the other individual was sleeping with someone else. Even without breaking a rule, that seems to indicate a different understanding or a different feeling towards the relationship than they themselves have or had. It's not uncommon to get hurt or upset. He does seem to be taking it very hard.

I would not agree with him that you cheated just to keep the peace, but you also don't have to agree that you did something wrong in order to listen to him and acknowledge and not dismiss his feelings. Of course, that means he needs to be open to sharing those feelings. I would make clear that you do want to talk further about this, whenever he's ready.

I see why you're objecting to sleepovers in the circumstances you stated, but I think you have a much better argument if you allow sleepovers when they're arranged in advance, not spur of the moment decisions, and making it plain that if they abuse the rules they'll get grounded for a while."

"Idk my sister says shit like that to me, like ""you're totally dateable, I'd date you"" like I said in another comment, and it's not weird. We've both dated girls in the past so I guess it's like oooooOOOOO maybe so, so inappropriate!!! But it doesn't feel like that to us. I think people in here are underestimating just how different family dynamics can be while still being healthy and normal. I talk about sex with my siblings and parents in much the way OP does with his sister. ESPECIALLY with my siblings, we discuss that shit graphically. It's never the slightest bit weird to us. Anecdotal evidence doesn't work here--I'm reading all these comments that are like ""my siblings and I are close and we don't do that,"" which is like SURE but you're also not OP's husband's family."
"I've totally seen siblings cheer each other up by saying ""I'd date you if I weren't your sibling."" He didn't say ""fuck"" and didn't make it sexual. It was about cheering her up. None of this is weird to me at all."
Can you please link to some proof of that. AFAIK babies under a year cry because they have basic human needs like affection and food. That is not manipulation.
What's wrong with that?

"No, she hasn't said anything else about it, and is mostly acting normal, if a bit more shy, I assume from embarrassment."
"&gt;And the problem is his insecurity yet he always makes me feel like the problem is me.  


This is known as Gaslighting. He is manipulating you into believing that you have done something wrong when you haven't in order to wear down your resistance to him so that when he tells you that you are wrong, you stop fighting with him and immediately back down. It's dangerous. It's abusive. It will escalate.

"I posted to legal advice a few minutes ago. I'm super worried what will happen with the kids, but she had stormed in about an hour ago saying if I told anyone that she would take the kids and be gone. Obviously it might just be a threat but I don't know how these cps reports work. "
"Have you been to a college lately? Literally, the EXACT same story happened to me in school. It was a regular thing to be honest. During group projects I always took the lead to ensure that every thing was done correctly. There have been numerous times I have caught plagiarism in my group work. It is rampant today in college, they are maybe not the majority of students, but probably at least half. "

I believe u/scarocov was referring to OP as ""she."" OP was still high and not thinking clearly. "

I had a dream about your boyfriend being a giant dumbass.
"First, if your boyfriend isn't with you get him there now. My SO got me through many times like this with my own Nmom. That kind of reply from her would set off my panic and I'd worry all day about getting screamed at until I cried. I get it. Hopefully your Bf gets it also and will get there. 

Second, sit down and try to take a few deep breaths. Remember that you are an adult in your own place.  Once they bring you want you need then they can't hold that over you. Make a plan to go low or no contact. 

Third, can you tell them you have something planned at a specific time?  Like at 3 you have a make up college exam, or you promised your best friend you'd pick out a dress. Or heck, can you get a friend to call you hysterically with an excuse so you have to leave?

Fourth, after this you need to get into therapy. This will help you immensely because the way your NParents treat you and how you react WILL filter into your every day life. If you become a parent you will want and need a healthy background to guide you. And it will help with your anxiety. 

Finally, remember that they aren't moving in. They will leave. It will be over eventually. "
"He is the one allowing his mom to affect your relationship by refusing to assert appropriate boundaries with her. He is basically showing you that he finds it more acceptable to allow you to be verbally and possibly even physically abused by her than to stand up to his mommy. 

You aren't the one making him choose, but to be clear, he IS making a choice every time he minimizes her behavior, and he isn't choosing you.

You need to stand very firm on this, and if he is unwilling to see things for what they are I'm sorry to say that this might not be the guy for you. "
He can't really reevaluate. It's a duty at this point. 
It's his way of tying you to him. Run away girl 
"Do you have any hobbies? Maybe you're stale in your sex life because your life is surrounded by kids? Do you ever get out with friends? You shouldn't just be a mom, you're a person too. "
"&gt; So try to think of it in the way you might think of an item that you might buy to help you do your favourite hobby, or an expensive car. Nobody really needs an expensive car. A good second hand Ford will take you just as far as a top range brand new BMW. It doesn't make financial sense to buy the BMW, but people do it because it makes them feel good.

When you put it that way I understand completely. Yep. I made a mistake... "
"Hate to break it to all ya'll, but this is actually completely normal and very common. Your hormones after having a baby go through a radical change, and even small shifts can cause big effects. Especially if you are nursing.

Anyone familiar with the female hormonal cycle? Basically, right before you ovulate (the first 2 weeks of your cycle generally) your hormones peak and make you horny, so you want to conceive. Immediately, I'm talking the day after ovulation, those hormones plummet rock bottom. Many new moms (or old moms, moms with toddlers) are in a constant state of low-level low hormones, never quite getting back to the peaks that they were at before. Breastfeeding, especially breastfeeding that prevents the return of your fertility, is a particular culprit. 

There's nothing ""wrong"" per se, she's probably perfectly healthy.

My advice, OP? You have got to get out of the house. Do you do date nights? Do NOT underestimate the mental exhaustion you are experiencing from being mom 24/7. DO date nights once a week. Get out of the house without your husband or kids as often as possible. Take a yoga class a couple nights a week. 

I have absolutely been there, and I thought it would never get better. It DID!!!!!! But it took years, and pressure (from my husband, from myself) did not help. You are stressing yourself the fuck out and building a ton of negative associations around sex that you do not want to have to work on later. Just relax, agree to take a break from trying to be the same person you were before babies, go on some dates, have some drinks. DOn't worry about the sex. 

Side note. Have you ever been away from your child overnight? Is he sleep trained?"
"&gt;That one was recommended to me after I got out of a relationship with a sociopath who tried to sleep-deprive me into killing myself because he thought it would make a great story to tell other people he wanted to fuck.

The fuck.  I'm glad you got out of there!

&gt;And that the only ""this is how sociopaths are dealt with"" anecdote she gave was the possibly-apocryphal story about the Inuit method of sending a sociopath out on a solo ice-fishing trip, following half a day behind, and then when they go to sleep for the night, pushing them through the ice.

I don't remember this part, but it sounds like a great story.  I'll have to reread that book sometime."
Sounds like she made it super easy for him ....
"Okay, so imagine you're living with three males [23] for the summer to finish up your degree. They're really tidy, and they all have girlfriends. Picture this in your mind. Imagine how you interact with the aforementioned Males who you don't know particularly well, but are now sharing a space with.

Now interact with your female roommates exactly like that."
The baby was born 3 days ago so I promise you they are not having sex. I would believe him on this. The couch with a baby monitor would be better.
"She sounds like a pretty nasty person, and for as long you stay with this guy, she is gonna be a major part of your life."
"Do not ""take some of it back."" She would damage her own credibility and trivialize the issue. HR would start questioning even more if OP's story is inconsistent. Definitely try talking to someone higher up about the possibility of sexual harassment training. But this issue to affecting OP to the point that it is interfering with her work and mental health. It needs to be resolved and OP needs to grow a backbone. If OP doesn't want to deal with it at all, then I would suggest looking for another job."

"Obviously we're reacting to you saying that a woman who won't take a man's last name isn't committed. It's not a bad thing for a woman to take her husband's last name, it's a bad thing for it to be the expectation and to look down on women who want to keep their name and/or pass it down to the kids. "
"You will indeed never know what ""a girl"" wants because every person is different with their own likes and dislikes, and this of course includes girls. 

This whole fake persona and extreme obsession with appearance is not attractive and very few women want to be put on pedestals.

Just be yourself and approach girls like the individuals they are, and you will eventually find someone that you click with.

Also, please try to avoid referring to men and women as males and females; it sounds douchy."
"OP mentioned it would possibly be less weird since her SO didn't ""go to school"" meaning she's probably in high school. Also I did go to college in freshman year for an elite charter school program in California, moved every year of my life so was pretty used to instability and change, had the highest standardized testing scores in all 4 of my high schools, dealt with an abusive step-dad and a lot of real mental issues. I cooked, cleaned, shopped, had a job and as soon as I graduated was working full time on a military base (as a civilian.)

 I also thought I was smart shit dating a 28 year old at 15/16 because I was *~sooo mature~* and now that I'm 20 I can't imagine dating a 15/16 year old, I can't imagine how extra that feeling will be when I'm 24.  And I know that just because I was academically successful doesn't mean that I was ready for an adult relationship, same with the fact that I had traveled a lot and dealt with unstable living situations. Just because I had adult responsibilities didn't mean I was an adult. Even if she felt ready he should know better. Neurologically it is impossible for her to genuinely be ready. She still was a 15/16 year old teenager, and simply put should not have been in a relationship with that man, regardless of how ""cool"" and ""mature"" she seemed."

"I vote just let it go. You see the negative impacts of snooping (like spoiling a surprise) on someone who has done nothing but earn your trust. Use that to ensure it doesn't happen again, that you've learned your lesson.

"&gt; an asshole who likes hurting others for his own amusement.

They didn't claim messing with people always makes someone an asshole. They stated hurting others for your own amusement makes a person  an asshole."
"&gt; This got me in trouble at college for lewd e-mails...I fall head over heels once they show true kindness and have a hard time with rejection. 

Reading between the lines, it sounds like you fall in ""love"" fast and lash out at the women or ignore their boundaries (e.g. lewd emails) and press for a relationship with them despite them showing no romantic interest or outright rejecting you. You feel because you've put forth effort being ""nice"" that the women should want a relationship with you.

Step One: Realize and accept that no other person *owes* you a relationship, let alone because you are ""nice."" Nice is the bare minimum qualification for a potential romantic partner. In addition to niceness, women want someone they're attracted to, someone who makes them laugh, someone who shares hobbies and interests, someone get's along with her friends and family, etc. You've got to do more than smile, open doors, and listen to them when they have a bad day. Ask yourself this: Do you fall for every woman who is ""nice"" to you or just the ones who are nice, pretty, smart, etc.?

Step Two: Acknowledge that you are't really a nice person.  You may think you are nice, but a nice person doesn't feel entitled to another person's affection. A nice person does not send unwanted lewd emails. A nice person listens when another person says ""no.""

Step Three: Stop trying to date and work on yourself. Find a new therapist. If you don't already go to the gym, go to the gym and improve your confidence. Find your self-worth. You don't have to love every single thing about yourself, but you need to learn to be comfortable in your own skin. Not everyone will want to date you, and *that is fine*. If you learn to enjoy you're own company, then being single doesn't feel lonely. When you aren't lonely, you aren't desperate. When you aren't desperate, being rejected is a lot easier to accept.

Step Four: Practice asking women out. Don't try to be their friend first. If you see a woman you find attractive and want to get to know her, ask her on a date. Use the word ""date."" If she says no (and statistically you probably won't get a yes right out the gate) say ""Ok"" and *move on*. Ask another woman. Keep asking new women until you get a yes.

Step Five: Remember that a ""yes"" from her does not equal ""I love you."" Hell, you may even decide *you* don't like *her*. Not every first date leads to a second. Not every relationship leads to marriage. Just have fun and see where it goes."
"I dwelled on it because, like I said, sorry is easy. It's a little flip of paper in the wind, and it doesn't actually *fix* anything. He said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again, and that didn't actually make me feel any better, because my feelings were hurt. It's like the good ol', throw a plate on the floor and say sorry to it. Did the plate magically unshatter?

My boyfriend and I let this pattern (me bringing it up, him saying sorry again, but he didn't think I should be making a big deal of it, we would fight and drop it, nothing felt fixed) go on for MONTHS until we had a huge, blow up fight. We almost broke up. I had gotten to the point where I didn't feel special, and he admitted he felt really emotionally disconnected from me because he would get defensive every time I got offensive. I would really encourage you not to get to that point.

Doing something nice is a step in the right direction, because it will affirm to her that she is *your* girlfriend and you love her. Someone else mentioned letting your ex know, kindly, that you would like displays of affection like that to stop between the two of you. Leave your girlfriend out of that conversation with your ex. 

I think you do need to talk about it. You need to find out exactly why it bothered her: did it make her feel threatened by the ex? Did it make her feel as though affection between the two of you wasn't special? Was she cheated on in the past, and this really triggered her? What was it? Go into this conversation with an open mind, and seek to understand why she's hurt so you can help her not hurt anymore. Ask her what she needs from you. Doing this, rather than going in armed to fight, will be a lot better for both of you. Don't try and prove who is right and who is wrong, because nobody will win that and it's not the problem. The problem is your girlfriend is upset and you don't know how to fix it. You're a team, and you need to work together to find a solution.

Sorry this was an essay, but I really hope it helps."
Her reaction is not okay.  I would either demand a reasonable explanation for her abusive behavior or walk away.

"Lots of people have all sorts of ""boundaries"" in relationships. Some don't want their SO having any friends of the opposite gender. Some dudes want to decide what their girlfriends wear.

"In this case it's true.

She says she doesn't mind him being over, it's her parents who have a problem with it. And the parents are the authority.

If he loved you and was considering marrying you, do you think him seeing you for about ten or fifteen minutes every night with a bit of redness or dark circles would make a difference? It's sadly ironic that your efforts to look constantly presentable to him was the thing that turned him off in the end.

We really don't ever debate on preferences. There is no ""right"" preference. That is why it is called a preference... This guy is just bringing you down for kicks. Honestly, I find that a bit sick.

doubt prenup would help much here unless OP is not planning on getting married till after her parents pass away and/or she gets her inheritance. Prenups protect what you had going into a marriage. If she gets inheritance 10-15 years into her marriage (which is likely what will happen since her parents are in good health and are probably going to live well into their 80-90s) prenup wont do much

"&gt; I haven't taken this suggestion very well, as it would be a non-exclusive break without a defined end, 

Ummm.... that's not a ""break."" That's ""breaking up."" 

""Breaks"" in general are bullshit, but tell her that you're okay with the break, so long as things stay exclusive (*for both of you*) and that there is a pre-determined limit. Otherwise, she's putting you on hold while she ""figures things out"" by dating around. 

You did the right thing by saying ""nope, that arrangement is unacceptable to me."" Now give her an Option B."
"It sounds like the family overall did try to follow standard advice for this kind of situation, which is to have other close adults step in to help with parenting-type duties if the bio parents are focused (arguably by necessity) on a very sick kid. The aunt, uncle and grandparents covered some vacations and school events, which is actually pretty good and in line with recommendations. It would have been worse to have no one turn up at school at all. But, I do understand that OP was still left feeling like a lower-priority kid: this situation shows that even when other adults do step up, it can't fully replace the bio parents if a kid is being ""parentified"" themselves in this kind of inappropriate dynamic. I think the parentification of OP towards his sister is specifically one of the unhealthiest things here: he wasn't able to just be a kid. :( "

You think most people completely replace their sex toy collection each time they break up with someone?
"Is your GF religious, or did she grow up in a religious or conservative home? Do you know if she's had any past abuse, specifically sexual?

How do these horseplay sessions end up not being sexual toward the end? You say you've touched her breasts, how did you end up there? Like, are you deliberately not escalating because you're nervous, or is she stopping you from escalating (like saying ""no"" with body language, stopping your hands, rolling away, etc)? If she's not indicating ""no"", then you just need to escalate. I'm not saying whip out your D in her face, but rather let your hands wander a bit more (grab her butt, run your hand up her inner thigh, etc), or do a bit of dry humping/grinding.

That said, you should also talk to her about it. I know she asked you out on the first date, but she's probably scared/nervous about you finding her sexy and wanting to have sex with her. My only advice here is to not talk to her if you're feeling frustrated about not having sex (like, if one of the horseplay sessions ends anti-climatically and you're not feeling great because of that). Start by telling her what she means to you emotionally and then just come out and say that you're ready to have sex and take it from there."
"That had better be a hell of a story. Any decent parents would move heaven and earth to help her out of a relationship like this. 

She has to find a way. It sounds like it'd be too emotionally risky for everyone for you to be the one to take her in. And she has to be *sure* she wants out. She can borrow someone else's phone if she's too afraid to use hers. But she needs to be the one to make the call, to a hotline or a shelter or both. No one else can do it for her, however tempting it may be."
"Not being familiar with MS and the difficulties it presents, is it reasonable that she could just go to bed earlier and wake up with more time to prepare?  If I'm too groggy to ""insert early morning verb"" on a regular basis, then maybe I should think I'm not getting enough sleep and adjust my schedule accordingly.  If it takes her a half hour to be at the point where she can physically walk her kids down, then maybe she should just get up a half hour earlier.

I'm half venting half asking.  Again, I'm not familiar with MS and its differences between people. "
"So, she cheated on you? That isn't a gut feeling. She just cheated on you. Why are you staying with her?"
"Not really, in most states, and certainly in mine, once a shelter has confiscated a dog and waited the minimum number of days prior to adopting it out, there is nothing legally the previous family can do.

He legally adopted the dog from a shelter.  It's his dog."
"It was the girls who asked if I'd consider returning her, but they also seemed almost content that she was looked after.

I'm certainly not even considering it until an adult comes by, and even then I'll have to think about it for a day or two, check with the control center for legalities and really examine if returning her is actually the right choice."
"I'm sorry dude, but you knew this girl since she was a 15 year old kid and you were still a grown man, then you got with her despite the ten year age difference and your history just recently. That's a bit much. The fact this was the most ""intense"" relationship of your life is not a good thing.

Pretending the circumstances surrounding you two aren't weird as fuck (they are) and that you don't need to find someone closer to your age (you do) I still think you need to move on from this because of the drama she has in her life. Never, ever hook up with someone who has a ""kinda-sorta"" partner. It speaks volumes about their character, and you'll likely always come in second place because you simply fill a temporary void until they reconcile. You're better off without her, and now you can finally focus on a healthy relationship with a *woman* you should be with.

"
"The best tactic for this is to say something along the lines of ""I found out everything.  If you do not tell me the FULL truth, if you grab your phone, if you walk out of this room - then you've made your decision to end this marriage.""

They will try to ask you questions to dig it out of you.  You have to stay strong, it's really tempting to answer sometimes.  They are digging for your info and trying to compile a way to weasel out.  Some example questions:

""Did you go through my phone?""  
""Is this about [womans name]""  
""Is it because I've been staying late at the office""
""Are you mad because I went with the guys to watch the game?""
""This is out of no where, why are you so angry"" - etc etc etc.  

Simply reply something along the lines of ""I'm not the one needing to explain any of this, you are.  It's your choice to be truthful or not""

Are bare minimum you should be waiting to hear what you already know - WITHOUT giving any clues or hints whatsoever.  Then press for a while longer.

Advance tactic would include eventually saying you give up, send him to the couch, you keep his phone, and see if he can ""think more clearly in the morning"""
You're now showing a pattern of taking things personally that are not about you. This is not slander. It is one random internet stranger making a comparison based on what they have seen. I think you should relax a little.
"&gt; Because most people take it on the chin

No, dude, that's a beard."
"Dude I love and support my partner. She's overweight. If someone even looked at her funny for it, I can't even tell you how ballistic I would go. "
"&gt; If you are still having trouble understanding his hurt, ask yourself this: ""if all I wanted was meaningless sex why couldn't I have done it with this guy?"" Pretty much any answer you can come up with is going to make him feel bad.
&gt; 

What if the answer is that she only likes having sex (meaningless or otherwise) with someone she's known for more than one or two dates? 

I mean, I get jealousy and some people expecting exclusivity and emotions being irrational and her boyfriend being hurt because of all that. But the way you phrased makes it seem like there's no answer to the question you posed that could do anything but hurt him even when looked at totally logically, and I just don't get that perspective. I think it's totally normal normal for someone to put ""new person I just started dating"" and ""long term FWB"" into totally different categories when it comes to how comfortable they are jumping into bed with them.

(Again, that's separate from the issue of ""when should you start refraining from having sex with anyone else, even if you are not yet comfortable having sex with this new person you're seeing?"" But I definitely think there are plenty of good reasons someone wouldn't want to have sex with someone they just started seeing while still being cool sleeping with a FWB.)

"You love your wife, and if it was just you then rolling over and letting her idiosyncrasies dictate the terms of your relationship would be fine. Not the choice I'd make, but it would be your life.

But it isn't just your life. You have children and a responsibility as a father to protect them. Your wife's issues are harming them, and you know this. For their sake counseling is a must."
"Okay, sure he has those qualities when things are hunky-dory, or just a little bad. But when things got very bad, when you broke down and had a full-blown panic attack in front of him, he handled it horrifically. I'm not gonna debate whether or not what he did with the grabbing was abusive, none of the people commenting here were there, none of us saw it happen, only you know if it truly felt abusive or if it was totally non-malicious and you just had a bad reaction to it because of your history. 

However, he handled the rest of it absolutely horribly and that's the problem I think you really need to be focused on. You said you've discussed your history of abuse and panic attacks with him at length, and when confronted with you having a panic attack, his reaction was to do absolutely nothing to help you except ask you what to do and then when you couldn't help him help you, he screamed at you and left you crying in the street. And then he came back and fucking snarked at you about the situation. Even if the whole, ""I'm just a scary guy I guess"" thing was meant as a self-deprecating statement, it was still totally snark and totally uncalled for and inappropriate and not how you talk to someone you love. That's an attempt to make YOU feel bad for being scared of him this one time. It's shitty, it's manipulative and it's something you need to take a long, hard look at. There's some quote that goes something like, ""when someone shows you who they are, pay attention."" You said you've never had a fight before that escalated his badly, this is who he is when things are really bad. He's showing you who he is, he's someone who snarks at his girlfriend and tries to make her feel guilty while she's having a panic attack in the street. Personally, I wouldn't continue being with someone like that without a serious discussion and a serious behavior adjustment, but that's for you to decide. You seem to just be posting here to have people tell you it wasn't really abusive and you're being a little crazy so you can justify staying with him, so you probably won't really even read this, but I hope that you do and you think about what I said. He's shown you who he is, only you can decide if that's the kind of person you want to be with for the rest of your life. "
"I don't see why he can't just be like ""I agree this stuff should be talked about but I feel a little hurt/awkward how you proposed it."" Actually it looks like he did say that and she said ok, we can do it like a discussion. So what's the problem?

She obviously just wants to identify their parenting styles in a bunch of different ways which is actually EXTREMELY sensible. Maybe if he's going to be upset about it being so structured, they should do it through a counselor, like pre-marital counseling but pre-kids counseling. "
"I'm not going to defend what he said but from what you posted it seems to me that you lean on him pretty hard to help you cope with your issues. As you said yourself, this is finals week so both of you.. even him.. are stressed to the max. Nowhere in your post do I see any real appreciation for the extra stress you put on him with your expectations when you need him. Is it so hard to see that when you wanted him to drop everything and come serve your needs that you maybe have pushed him over the edge?

Both of you need to learn how to communicate better. That's pretty obvious."
"The first year is the hardest, especially when you're broke. I went through it only a year ago. Follow the advice on your thread, try your fucking hardest for your family. Take it day by day. You are most definitely depressed, stressed, and tired. Keep pushing through! You CAN do this. I never thought my SO and I could come out of it alive, and we were living in a broken down RV for a year and a half with a screaming infant with no help from anyone. It was fucking hard. 
Start by communicating with your wife. "
"I don't know about the temporarily part. My niece is blonde (not extremely light, but definitely blonde) and her mom let her use Kool-Aid to dye the ends of her hair red two summers ago. Her best friend did it too. In about a month, the friend's hair faded; my niece's was still bright red. It lasted the entire summer with barely any fading and, since her school prohibits ""unnatural"" hair colors, in August she had to chop the bottom few inches off her (admittedly pretty long) hair. She was a little sad about it because she loved the length. She tried so many things to get it out, too (including washing her hair in dish soap, which makes me cringe to think about).

That probably won't be a big deal for a 3-year-old, especially if he has short hair, but just a warning for anyone with light hair thinking about doing this."
"&gt; You just tell him she is required to come.

Yeah and you can also explain that the other kids aren't there so they won't even know. I don't think you should necessarily teach him that they matter enough that if they *were* there it would make a difference and he should care, but I think - just as a temporary measure to ease any anxiety he has - this might reassure him while you figure out a better plan of attack."
"God I hope not, that's weird as hell."
"I was also a ""reject"" by my parents.   I believe in reincarnation and have found peace with the thought that my parents did me the favor of bringing me to  life on this earth.  The people who raised me, brought me the Joy in this life.  I choose to focus on the positive parts of my life.

"the longer you live the more you realise that cult behaviours can manifest anywhere, in any social group or family group. "
"&gt; I can not believe the audacity of your dad to imply he expects you to support him after he assaulted you.

Assaulted her *and then* send an email reaffirming that contact was cut. I mean, it's like an employer firing you, physically kicking your ass out the door, but still expecting you to keep showing up for work indefinitely. It's *ludicrous*."
"Your husbands comment is insane. I've gotten angry at my boyfriend for not letting me know he's okay when he's out at his gaming tournaments for 15 hours. I do not expect him to text me the entire time. I trust him enough. But he needs to let me know he's OKAY, and not dead when he hasn't texted in a few hours and it's late. 

I do have trust issues. They have put strain on our relationship in the past. But my bf has enough goddamn respect to shoot me texts messages so I know he's okay and that my mind can be at ease and he can enjoy his time out. 

Basically your husband will NEVER be that happy with those standards/boundaries. It sounds like you guys just need to part ways. I'm sorry, it must be a rough situation. My own personal opinion (and I know this is touchy and everyone is different) if your husband absolutely forbids your access to his phone, computer, etc. he's not trust worthy. He sounds manipulative as fuck. My last ex obliterated my trust in people and I couldn't so much as look at his phone he always threw it in my face ""if you trusted me you wouldn't ask"". Big red flags. Again my bf is completely open and lets me have access to his phone and tablet any time. Guess what I never have the urge to do? Look thru his shit bc he's so open with me and communicates with me. Bless him for putting up with my anxieties and walls in the beginning of the relationship. 

Anyway I'm rambling. Find someone who will respect you enough to realize it's rational to be worried that you haven't heard from them at 2am. Jesus Christ. "
"If you black out and drive drunk, are the cops victim-blaming you when they pull you over and arrest you? No. Because you're still responsible for your actions. Alcohol isn't a free pass to be an idiot. Presumably, if she hadn't consented to the kiss, her friends would have included that part as well; otherwise we have to assume it was consensual."
"&gt; This isn't an issue I feel angry about or anything but he is extremely delusional to think this and I don't know what to do. I do not want to break up with him at all. but what do I do?

Why do you need to do anything? 

Do you want him to admit privilege? Why? Is he mistreating anyone? Is he using anyone?"
"Normally, I don't immediately advise telling the cheated-on spouse of the affair...but in this instance, I think you absolutely should. If you have any easy and direct way of contacting his wife, give her proof of the situation. "

Gurrrrrl..."
And why in the world does that matter in the face of someone abusing her? 
"If people (close friends and family) are asking for money, just tell them that it's all tied up in the business and your accountant has everything else in all these various confusing types of brokerages....basically, throw a lot of jargon around until they get the idea. "
"&gt; But it isn't healthy stress release. If she hates her job and is unable to be social or act like an adult outside of work, then she's working too hard. Forgetting you have guests?

Just pointing out, the BIL and sister are there for four weeks."
"I don't blame him one bit. It's incredibly disrespectful to him to string him along on dates while you're getting your sexual needs met elsewhere. If you want to be single and have FWB, that's fine, but if you're looking for something long term, you should act like it, and that means not sleeping around while trying.

Basically you told your BF that he's good enough to take you on a date, but not good enough to fuck, and that hurts. I think you did something wrong, and I'm not alone."
"If we had a nickel for every 18-25 year old guy who can't deal with their partners sexuality before they dated, this sub would reddits #1 profit center.  

You're right that this is your problem and not hers.  However cut out the self-flaggellation and come to terms with your feelings.  I think these feelings originate from a bog-standard Madonna-Whore complex.  Sex and nude photos are dirty, especially when you aren't directly involved, women who do it are whores.  Your girlfriend ought to be sexually pure and chaste, your love for each other is higher and more meaningful than lust and carnal pleasure, she is like the Madonna.  This conflict between your two conceptions of her create this tension and anxiety.  If you truly can't reconcile them, and see your gf as human being entitled to her sexuality and all the nuance and experience that entails, then a therapist is definitely a good move."
Yeah I really don't know what the sister is freaking out about. What's weird about comfy pajamas and a blanket??
"Thank you for reading what I wrote, and writing me a thoughtful response back. I also am worried that he doesn't actually want to be with me any more, but can't move past the religious angle to actually...initiate not being with me any more. 

At this point, after reading everything today, I'm going to set up therapy for myself, and then talk to him about therapy for us as a couple and him as an individual as well. Whether it's with a religious figure or a trained therapist, both of us likely should be talking to someone. 

Thank you :)"
"I don't think I'll get very much push back, but I do think my final submission will be marked down this year (the professor is the one with the plagiarism issue) and also the reason why I wanted to remain anonymous.

But if it escalates, you're right! I think they want to keep this as hush-hush as possible and will leave me alone tho"
"Wait so they are disabled and your parents want you to care for them your whole life?

RUN

They are using you as cheap labor. They want to go travel in their age and leave you with them, they don't want to get proper care ofr them cause they have you. And you won't gt pay. 

YOu won't have a life kid. Go. It is not your responsibility. You were not born to take care of them

There is a German saying:  ""Du bist deines eigenes Glückes Schmied"" You are your own lucks Smith, you forge your luck so to say.

You can stay behind and wither away. Then you parents have effectively disabled another child. Or cou can leave and be happy, making your own decisions, living your live, loving, your own family."
It's disrespectful when he's doing this when you are by his side
"Absolutely :)

I'll also throw this recommendation considering that, the book ""Why Does He Do That?"" By Lundy Bancroft. It's written specifically for people in relationships that have grown toxic/abusive/etc and are wondering what's going on. 

Your partner also doesn't have to be an abuser to get good info from the book. The author uses the term ""abuser"" as a kindof catchall for anyone who's angry, insulting, disrespectful, etc to their SO. He talks about physical/sexual abuse too, but it's still insightful if you don't believe your partner meets the definition of an abuser. Its organized into sections so you can skip things you don't feel are relevant and can focus on the topics/questions you specifically are looking for. 

One of the reasons I recommend this book is it has a good sized list of resources at the end, including resources for women with children, custody, etc. 

It's on kindle and things like that, but there's also a free PDF file online. Google ""why does he do that pdf"", it should be the first result if you choose to look into it, even if it's just for the additional resources :)"
I would do the opposite and send a picture of a ring you (or she) thinks is ugly and say it's super expensive. 
"It's a family name, and your nephew is going to be part of your family. Your family already knows how to navigate having 2-3 people with the same name in it.

Say nothing and keep the peace. Compare the worst possible outcome (your brother breaks all ties with you and your mom takes his side), with the best possible outcome (a kid is named Brian instead of Mike.) Is option 2 really worth risking option 1?"
"God, I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds it so embarrassing. And it's so hurtful, it really dents my self esteem in a big way. When I've brought it up with my boyfriend he just tells me I'm imagining it. So as little test I ogled every hot guy I saw for about a week last summer - usually tanned runners on the beach - and quickly he grumbled about 'vain' men who work out in public and how they're 'full of themselves'. Pathetic. "
"Oh sorry he definitely wouldn't cosign. When his mom asked he told her no and hung up on her. He hasn't spoken to her since. He has always been extremely supportive and has always been in my corner when it comes to his family. 

He did express to them that these are his decisions. He has three siblings and they are all in very unhappy, almost abusive relationships. He is also the only one who has a career, owns a home and is married. I believe  jealously may be a factor in the family dynamics. "
"That's so cruel and arrogant of them. They wouldn't allow you to make this crucially important decision about your own life -- to marry or not marry -- with full information. 

I don't always think infidelity has to be a deal-breaker, but if I were in your position, this particular infidelity would be for me. It would destroy me to stay. 

I'm so sorry. You don't deserve this. Please be kind to yourself and do whatever you need to do right now. Can you take a crazy singles vacation?"
"I wouldn't be okay with this.  There was a time in the beginning of our relationship that his ex-gf was always calling him or texting him, wanting him to come work at her house, or help her son, etc.. etc.. etc... and he'd say, ""We're just friends!"" I grew very tired of it fast and I guess I gave him an ultimatum, but it wasn't done lightly.  I told him if this other woman is going to be so central in our life, then we are not a match.  It was more about taking care of myself then telling him what to do, I know other women don't mind their SO having a woman best-friend, but I did mind.  

Anyways, it says a lot that after 4-years you think he would choose her.  I need to be number one in a relationship. I don't think you are being unreasonably jealous considering he puts your comfort and feelings second, I think you are being human. You have a choice to continue being second, or find someone that will put you first."
"Don't. Even if his intentions are ""good"", you're too young for him. I would seriously, seriously doubt any 21 year old guy willing to date a 15 year old. Not only is it illegal / pathetic / sick / etc, there's nothing you two could have in common besides him wanting to have sex with a minor. 

If you still feel this way in a couple years then tell him, but for now you should look for a boy closer to your own age. "
"&gt;What I want to do is leave and never look back

You totally have the power to do this. You could do it today. You could at least start making a plan today, and I think you need to. 
  
If you reread your post, is there a chance, ANY chance, that maybe you are not the sole problem in this relationship? Do you think that maybe there is a chance that your husband is NOT perfect? 

If you had a choice: 

*  Sit and watch Scrubs with your husband and fight over how unfair it is to white men and what a bitch Carla is until your husband storms off and blames you for smoking 

OR

*   Sit and watch Scrubs with your husband and laugh at the antics of goofy J.D. and his best buddy Turk and the amaaaaa-haaaayzing Dr. Cox as they sling insults and goofs, 

Which would you have chosen?
 
Which one of you starts fights? 
 
It sounds like it's your husband who wants to fight, and you'd prefer to just enjoy a TV show...

So how are YOU the problem in your marriage? "
"Ending a rant about how it's bigotry that women are upset with men being patriarchal with ""fuckin blow me"" undercuts your point."
"Here's the problem, you met the guy, had a few interactions, and told yourself a story about him.  The story you told yourself was that he was a nice, wholesome, family man, non-threatening and even effeminate.  Probably never swore at anyone in his life, loved by his kids, and has wholesome hobbies on the weekends like volunteering or golf.  (Or whatever the story was).

You made this story up almost entirely from thin air.  Maybe parts of it were composed from things you heard...from HIM.  Or from other people, who heard them...from HIM.  

And now when you have *actual evidence* that the story isn't totally true, you're refusing to believe it.  

It's important to identify these stories in life.  You say you are sheltered, consider this experience with this guy to be a really, really cheap life lesson on why you shouldn't trust your first impression, but should supplement it with ongoing experience."
"I really doubt this isn't a troll, but just in case:

That is a really gross contamination of the shower, and even without addressing you losing weight or getting a stronger toilet seat(since both of those have been addressed at length by other comments that you took issue with), at the *very least* you should be willing to compromise by removing your shit from the shower rather than stomping it down the drain (which is terrible for your plumbing), and then every single time scrubbing the absolute fuck out of that shower/tub/drain with bleach. 

Honestly if your girlfriend is putting up with this then she's either got her own mental issues, or she's incredibly in love with you. Actually even if she's in love with you, she's got to have mental issues to live in that situation herself. "
"Well, BIL himself had asked for advice, so at this point it is personal. 

Frankly this guy is off the charts and it means unusual measures. 

I agree with people saying he should be given a link to r/niceguys and/or this post. Also r/creepypms might be a good one too. 

This guy needs a serious kick in his social nuts."
"Oh yeah no definitely, like the fact that everyone started wolf whistling makes it super inappropriate. Like, i'm mexican, i'm used to greeting with a kiss on the cheek, but that's just weird. "
"it's not just the 13,000. 

The extra $250 *for saving*, wasn't. "
It doesn't sound shady and you're really inferring a lot. 
"Well, in all honesty, one of the reasons that he ""owes"" you so much money has to do with the fact that you expected him to pay for half of a luxurious lifestyle, when he was previously not living that way. It really is not fair to just expect someone to suddenly be able to afford the same lifestyle as yourself. In a relationship, you have the choice to either live on the budget of the person who earns less, or subsidize the person who earns less. You don't have the choice to try and demand that the lower earner suddenly earn more and pay half--that will never work out."

"Rather than being about logic and emotion, it sounds like you and your partner have different values when it comes to choosing a bank. You've given a good accounting of yours, but I imagine she would also be able to give several reasons for her own choice. At the very least, it sounds like she values loyalty and trustworthiness in organisations - you haven't said if she's been with this bank for any length of time, but if she has, and is happy with how she's been treated, is it logical to risk moving to a bank with objectively better rates, but may provide worse service? Likewise, she may value having a personal connection to workers at her bank - and there is logic behind that! Aside from feeling more comfortable herself, *they* are more likely to provide her with good customer service and accountability if she is the daughter of the Winters, that the teller plays bridge with once a month, rather than a name and social security number on a computer screen.

It is important to recognise that people can have very different values, and their logical decisions follow on from those values. *People can come to very different conclusions about the same matter, and both be logical*. If you want to, say, argue with someone that they're objectively wrong about preferring cats to dogs, or living in the city rather than the country, you're it going to get very far. If, instead, you accept that their preferences are as valid as your own, out can start finding common ground for a compromise."
"Ok, that's a good point, didn't think about it like that."
"Just wanted to tell you that you are a strong person for supporting yourself and studying all on your own. I admire this in people. You don't need a person like that in your life. You don't *have* to make this relationship work. If he doesn't value you, support you and make you feel better when you're together,then he's no good to you, and if he's acting like you're beneath him, he thinks you're no good for him. You can have a happier life by dumping his unappreciative and unsupportive ass. You don't owe him to be his girlfriend. You can deal a whole lot better without him!"

"&gt; OP is getting off too easily here. You knowingly participated in this girl's emotional cheating, well before the so-called open relationship period.

Thank you for this. 

I don't understand the people that are defending him here? OP **actively** helped her cheat, which makes him as bad as her. "
"I don't think PootieTang ia even remotely discouraging OP from dumping the guy. The appeal being made here is entirely inappropriate.  OP has a sour taste from the way local military personnel act and treat her - which is fair enough, but she should be careful to not write off *all* military personnel because of that.

 It'd be like me deciding to be a misogynist because some woman sexually harassed me - I can understand the association and bad experience, but there are a lot of good people in the world despite thay. That may be a high content analogy for some. Anyway. While marines definitely have a reputation for being assholes, there are some really great fuckers out there, and I think the petition is just that OP shouldn't automatically write them off based on an annecdotal scale of evidence. "
"&gt;I dont buy she doesn't remember.

But...why? I see no logic supporting this claim at all. Obviously, she knows you slept together because you were there. That doesn't mean she actually remembers the sex. And if she doesn't remember it, yeah, she's going to be weird. That's kinda common sense.

"Op genuinely believes her parents will beat her to the point of being unable to call the police if she joked back in kind.

Yeah there's back story she left out."
"No.  It's your wedding, and your choice.  If she doesn't like it, too bad."
"I don't think this is the best approach, because OP has set a precedent of allowing her coworker to talk to her while she is on the toilet. If she suddenly swings 180 while on the toilet, it'd be far more confusing and likely to go wrong than if she talks to her away from the bathroom about how she doesn't feel comfortable."
"&gt;Am I the bad guy here?

You are very, VERY close.

If you're serious about your current and every future relationship you're ever going to have, then you're gonna to have to cut off Sally. Her behavior is complete and utter bullshit and completely unacceptable.

While Cammie is accepting of things the way are now, sooner or later she's going to get sick and tired of Sally's behaviour towards her and it will get to the point where you'll either have to pick either Sally or Cammie. 

If you don't I easily can see Cammie walking out of your life, you'll be just as much to blame as Sally and not one person with an ounce of sense is going to blame Cammie for leaving you."
"Some people want to be married and some people don't. Both are totally valid  but those people should not be in a relationship.

"I don't think any of us on here can tell you what's best for you- long distance can certainly work, but only if you both want it to. Hard decisions like the one you guys will have to make in a year will always be on the horizon, no matter where you live or what relationship you're in.

I would spend this week thinking through the realities of the situation and your stance on them. How exactly would the logistics of seeing each other work? Will you be able to afford to meet in the middle someplace, or will one person have to make the whole long trip so you guys can stay at one of your apartments? What, ideally, would you both like to do once you're both graduated? Does the area where you're currently in have job opportunities in both of your fields?

Then sit down this weekend and talk things over with her, as calmly as you can manage. Hash out a vision for how a longer-distance future would work, and then think about if that vision is enough to make you happy. A year is not that long of a time if your relationship is worth it to both of you, but if one of you has serious doubts then it won't work."

Where did I say that? And where did I say it was a joke between us? 

It's a game. That's literally it. Marrying anyone in an offline, single player game that is literally designed for you to do anything you want has nothing to do with OP. 

Is everyone here actually so insecure and controlling that they can't handle someone playing a game the way they want and actually doing something on their own? "
"Sit him down and tell him this. While fully clothed, in a neutral space. Even show him this question, not because you want to hurt him, but in an attempt to be completely clear about what you are experiencing. 

Because if he can't hear you and respond, the relationship won't last. It's not a threat, it's just a simple fact of the universe. If his touch is uncomfortable and unpleasant for you, the relationship will end!

If he still wont stop, dump his dumb ass."
"I really appreciate hearing this, especially considering he kept telling me that I was over-reacting. He claims he would ""never want to insult my intelligence!"" but yet, he did, severely. "
"&gt; I as a anti porn woman find it interesting that as human beings we seek to make a very clear line between porn use and regular sexting of women. Isn't that basically saying naked women in porn don't count because that have no value as human beings but regular women online do count because they still retain their value on the basis of being regular women and not porn stars?

No, I think it's because with porn, there is no interaction, whereas with sexting, there is some sort of real connection. Even if it's just to get off, it's different because there is a back-and-forth, rather than just looking at a video, where the person you are looking at has no idea you exist and never will.  It's the same reason many people are OK with their SOs using porn, but not with them using a cam girl. And the same reason many people who are OK with their SOs using porn would NOT be OK with their SO DMing their favorite porn star and having a sexy back and forth.

(Not saying you have to be OK with porn, just saying I think there's way more to it than ""naked porn star = OK, naked other people = not OK."")

"Yes, of course you should leave the 21 year old you seemingly adopted.

Lady, you moved him in WAY too fast, he isn't paying any rent, and he's definitely too young (maturity wise) for you to consider marriage and babies. 

If you want a mature, financially responsible man, don't date guys right out of college who live with their parents and work part time. Date men your age/slightly older who actually have their shit together. You are too old to wait and see, because no one should take on a project. You buy a car, a house and date a man AS IS. Not a fixer upper. "
"My sister is incredibly flaky. She doesn't have the same issues your sister does, but she tends to get ""sick"" at the very last minute when she's made a plan she decided she doesn't want to keep.

It's not worth it to yell at her anymore, really. I just make fewer plans with her, and the ones I do make, I don't depend on her for. For example, if I want to make a plan to see a movie or take a class with her, I ask myself if it is something I wouldn't mind doing by myself. If I wouldn't do it by myself, I don't make the plan. If I would, I do, because it's not unlikely that I will wind up doing it by myself when she gets ""sick"". You can't depend on  your sister for anything, so the solution is not to depend on her."
"For your kids, yes. They are super young. Later they can do it themselves. For now you have to because setting them up to be normal and healthy takes priority. Once they are older you get to step back."
"&gt; He doesn't have to work around the clock, he chooses to do so.

That's not how these things work in Silicon Valley startups, which is what OP seems to be talking about. You either work what everyone else works, or you get dropped and your team resent you because you've made their lives even harder.

&gt; If he was promoted, that means he supervises people,

Also not the case - there are many stages in tech careers that don't involve supervising and don't allow for delegation

&gt; He should also be putting his resume out there on the basis of his promotion. 

Yeah sure, with all that free time he has to polish his resume, research and talk to companies, and do interviews...

&gt; Also, if he comes back at 9:30 there's a possibility he's already fucking the ""homewrecker"", and not really at work. 

Again, this is far from unusual hours for SV tech startups and absolutely no reason to believe he's cheating. It's shitty, and toxic, and I wouldn't go to one of those companies if you paid me a million pounds a year, but some people love it and some people get sucked in when they don't love it.

That's... not very flattering to men. I suspect there are a good many men who would not consider ""getting physical"" for any reason, including suspected cheating. 

And fuck everything about trying to convince women that this is remotely acceptable. Even if it's a one off, better for her to break up and be safe (and for him to get his temper in check) than to risk the alternatives. "
"Yeah, I had a 3.8 in college and received two scholarships based on grades alone. Each was $500 per semester. While that's nothing to sneeze at, it was really only a drop in the bucket compared to how expensive tuition is at state universities. 

Unfortunately, OP's parents income likely affects if he's eligible for a scholarship at all, even if he has a great GPA. If his parents can afford to contribute to his education, in the eyes of the college, OP does not need those scholarships. I know I had that problem. "

Also, OP, a lot of what I'm reading does not pass the sniff test for an HR sexual harassment complaint. For example: 

&gt; This guy consistently teases me or belittles me in front of other employees who usually laugh, join in, or are neutral. I don't think a lot of them realize how frequently I experience this, like on a weekly sometimes daily basis, or why I might find it denegrating - because at face value these things mostly appear as harmless teasing, like how an older brother might tease a younger sister.

Welcome to being the new kid in almost *any* job.  You're 22.  You're gonna get your chops busted a) for being 22 and b) being the new kid.  It's happens.  And like you said, it's like brotherly teasing, not sexual. It will pass when you show that you can handle it (which you obviously cannot) and start to give back, or someone even newer comes along to be a target.  

&gt;I also notice he'll sometimes monitor what I'm working on and/or criticize it

You're kidding.  This is a *supervisory responsibility*.  Even if it's not directly his project, if he sees you are mishandling someone else's project, he's gonna damn well notice because he doesn't want you screwing up *his* work either.  Again, in no way is this sexual.  This is ""new kid on the block"".  I don't care who you are, at 22 you have not proven you're capable yet.  You're a professional now, act like it.  Your work has an impact on many other people and you're acting like your should be above reproach because ... why exactly? Because you're a woman? *That's* sexist.

"Imo, this guy has already cheated on his wife. His behaviour towards you surprised you and grossed you out because it crossed significant boundaries. Now imagine how she would feel if she were to learn of all that has transpired between you two. How would you feel in her position, your husband lusting after a younger student of his for years, and pursuing contact with her along those lines? "

"Firstly, congrats on the baby! I'm sure you both are very excited. Secondly:

&gt; I'm willing to bet they come crawling back after the baby is born.

This this this. That's EXACTLY what's going to happen. And let me ask you OP, do you really want someone this emotionally abusive to have access to your child? Whether or not you choose to end contact completely is up to you and your wife, but if you choose to stay in contact, I wouldn't let them be alone with the baby. People who are emotionally unstable like that aren't gonna make a good babysitter."
"Just a heads up, don't give your money to your mom directly. If you go away, you don't know if your sister might pop back in the picture and be hounding your mom for money, now that you're not there to keep an eye on the finances. Be careful OP and good luck."
"The sex thing is a confusing example - it's not clear what you want.  Do you want her to pretend to be turned on even when she's not and have sex with you even when she isn't in the mood so that your self esteem isn't hurt?  As a matter of biology, she can't really force herself to get turned on.  It seems like she's made it clear that that's not going to magically change (and how could it?), but you keep bringing it up.  What is the goal?

If she can't get turned on unless she's independently in the mood, then your options are to work on your insecurities so that your self esteem isn't affected by that and embrace that she instigates sex on her own, or to leave her. 

I agree with the other commenter that it's hard to tell whether you're raising these things in a critical way or using soft starts.  If you're being critical, of course she's going to be defensive and get flooded and need time to cool off.  Especially if the example used in your meta-discussion about communication was the sex example, I could see where she's feeling like she's being attacked for not caving to your repeated sexual demands when she's been clear about her boundaries rather than feeling like you're genuinely open to discussing communication issues.

If you can both agree that you struggle with communication you should consider seeing a counselor to work on communicating with each other."

Kids with attachment disorders are cunning and manipulative? That's quite a bold statement. To me, rather, it sounds like he's a neglected child and wants what's not in his life: a parent who cares. Most kids with attachment problems come from troubled homes, and there's no reason to demonise them all as 'cunning and manipulative'. Also, his behaviour just sounds like the start of developing anti-social and narcissistic traits, possibly from feeling jealous of OP's kids.

"I never saw the movie ""Ride"" but when I saw the trailer for it, this moment stuck with me so much. (Can't link on this subreddit so Youtube search ""Ride trailer"" and the first link, go to minute 01:26 to see it.) Over-bearing mom Helen Hunt stocks her son at college, but meets Luke Wilson and seems like she falls for him and starts to leave her son alone. In the preview scene, Hunt asks Wilson **""you were once a 20 year old, what did you want from your mother?"" he replies ""for her to want nothing from me.""** That stuck with me so much because it was exactly how I felt (at age 30) about my own mom at the time. Just leave me alone for a minute, please!

I bet you all this son of yours wants is nothing from you. No expectations, no obligations. No phone calls, no lunches, no dinners, no forced obligations. Just let him be. Leave him alone. Let him cut the apron strings, stretch, and just be on his own for a minute without family obligations. Then he'll come back. Because nothing tore you apart - just his need for independence. So he'll come back and be with the family again soon enough - just as soon as you can let him go. ""If you love someone, let them go."" "

There are affluent black families who have been given far more opportunities than poor white ones and vice versa, upper class America is not a fair representation of the rest of the world.

There are also programs, grants and incentives available for minorities that are not available for whites. There are schools that would sooner take an under qualified Jamal to a higher achieving Scott in the name of diversity. So I ask you, why is privilege only considered a privilege when it results from whiteness?

If a store owner decides he doesn't want to hire a minority, that is on the store owner, not ""white privilege."" If an Asian owner doesn't hire white workers, that's on him as well. There seems to be this general mindset that white people as a whole can just coast through life doing the bare minimum by virtue of being white when it is demonstrably untrue."

"&gt;She really hurt my feelings.

You feel the way you feel and no one can tell you how to feel, just like she feels the way she feels and no one can tell her how to feel, but something caught my attention;

&gt; ""You wouldn't take 15 minutes to do something for me, so why should I take 15 minutes to do something for you?"".

This kinda tells me that she feels like you are not there for her. Notice I say that this is how she appears to *feel* not that you really are not there for her. I acknowledge that you took time off to assist her, so, I am just trying to present her perspective, because you already have your own perspective. 




From her perspective, she feels like you do not do enough things for her but appear to be demanding more from her than she feels she should give. I suspect that there is some frustration on her side, perhaps even resentment that stems from your history together. Now, it could be that there was one huge incident where she felt like you were not there for her, or perhaps it has been a series of minor incidents that have added up over the years, where she feels like you are not supportive of her. She does not feel the incentive to go out of her way to do give in to your requests, just like she feels like you have never really gone out of your way to assist her. It is also possible that she feels some resentment towards you in regards to how you were raised. Were you favored over her? Have you been bossy? Were you two always close but somewhere down the line, your relationship became distant or you have never been close? In any case, of you want to go deeper as to what could be going on here, these are just some of the things to consider. If you want to remain on the surface, then just wait till things have cooled down, be the bigger person, apologize and ask for her to just take a photo.

"How long have you been dating your girl, dude?

Your girlfriend's sister makes a point to say watching football is better than watching baseball and you are upset by that? Are you serious? She is ribbing you (and I can't stress how gentle that teasing is) and the best thing to do would be to verbally spar right back, engage in a little back and forth and they a) might actually respect you and b) lay off the comments because now they know you are willing to play (foot)ball. My in-laws tease me plenty, I throw some playful barbs back, and I am a whole lot more integrated into the family than the other white in-laws too afraid or offended to get in there and mix it up.

I'm pregnant with my first, due in August, and I can't imagine having to deal with this stress 8 days before my due date.  You can contact them in a few weeks when things have settled down.  For now, just ignore them, keep doing what you're doing, and focus on your new little family.  Remember, this is a time when you definitely don't need stress.  Congratulations!"

"What are you even supposed to think? First of all, get a clue. You knew how your brother/family would react to you dating someone outside of whatever your race is, and yet you still exposed your man to that. Did you even warn boyfriend? Think of how you would feel if your man brought you around his family and his sister behaved in the same manner. Your brother and family are straight up embarrassing. The fact that you are even questioning who should be mad at is crazy. I wouldn't be surprised if your man dumped you for not having his back 100%. If you don't understand racism, prejudice and the racial inustices that people all over the world suffer, maybe an interracial relationship is not for you. Also, you should apologize to your man (if he is still your man), take him out for a nice dinner and tell your family that if they cannot respect the man you choose to love that you cannot be around them.

"Bingo. Yes, she had serious health issues, but that doesn't change or excuse what she was doing. She knew enough not to pull that shit around witnesses, which means she could control her behavior. 

Look, I do think you would benefit by searching for a therapist you really click with. Carrying all this around must be so heavy and exhausting for you. The right therapist can be a godsend. That said, you are under no obligation to have a family member who was emotionally abusive to you in the past attend your wedding. Health issues or no, it was wrong and horrible, and it doesn't sound like anyone has ever acknowledged what you went through. You were a child made into a caregiver and whipping boy, while being given little or no emotional support.

Your sister is an adult who can't be trusted to not derail your wedding in a bid for attention. You can't apparently trust your parents to rein her in. There is nothing wrong with you not wanting her to attend, or wanting to have a special day without having to constantly fear she'll act out. I really hope you'll be very honest and open with your fiancée about your past and your feelings. She may want a big wedding, but will she want it at this cost to you? Perhaps you could elope and have your own special day/honeymoon together, then have a big reception with family and friends some time later. "

"You cheated. You didn't murder her family. The relationship isn't working. Eat some dinner tonight and then explain that you want to stop wasting each other's time. Yes, cheating is wrong, and you shouldn't lie to yourself - either you were okay with it happening, and allowed it to happen, or you were raped. If it's the latter, then take steps. If it's the former, take responsibility. It was wrong.

You don't have children with her, you two will both be able to get on with your lives. But not until you face the facts that your relationship isn't working.

"&gt;  before i put it in he said, ""dont put that in, it will go lumpy a bit like rice pudding"" i told him to ""go away im cooking and flour thickens it out and doesnt make it lumpy"", as soon as i added the flour it turned out exactly how he said, lumpy. He didnt really care and ate it anyway.


&gt;  i started to ask him what the most poisonous snake is as the documentary didnt really mention it and hes into his reptiles, he said only one or two snakes are actually poisonous and venom and poison are different, we argued about the difference until he said""i dont really want to argue so here"" he brought up multiple searches and articles on the difference which turns out there is a big one.


&gt; I called him over to help me with my computer which was acting really slow and taking ages to respond, he felt it and asked how long it had been on for, i mentioned 2 days and he said ""its probably just being worked to hard and over heating a little bit, turn it off for 30 minutes"" i started to say that all ive been doing is watching videos and playing some scroller games and surfing the net, he said ""well its hot and its been on for a while so thats my only advice"" i told him ""go if your not going to help"", later i turned my PC off and waited for a bit after he left the house and it started working fine again.


The problem isn't that your boyfriend is right all the time. The problem is you like to ask for help on things and then proceed to argue points that you don't understand until you're in a fight. Then, it seems like you get proven wrong more than he gets proven right. Hell, half the time he's like ""I'm exhausted, here's proof or why"" and you're just deadass wrong, yet you say rude shit to him all the time like ""you're no help"" and ""go away I'm cooking here""


Just be happy he hasn't dumped your rude ass yet. I'd start treating  him with respect. You don't, and you should. For fuck's fucking sake, don't say ""I asked him a question because he's an expert in ___"" and then proceed to argue with him as if you didn't just ask him for info on something he's knowledgeable on.



You're just ignorant and bratty. That's really the only problem here."

"&gt;I suppose I'm asking if I'm just a butt hurt liberal and this isn't that bad, or do I have a right to feel insulted? 

Sounds like he's purposely antagonistic (or was in previous encounters). So it makes sense to feel insulted - he was trying to insult you.

That said, I highly doubt he'll be that way at the wedding because he will be much too busy. Plus the election is over, so it would just be weird for him to keep taunting you about Hillary Clinton. Unless politics are somehow coming up at the reception, I think you'll be just fine. If you're worried then just avoid him as much as possible.

&gt; Is it worth it to not go?

Do you support their marriage? Are you able to afford going? If you say yes to both, I think you should go there. 

&gt;What's a good excuse?

If you are really worried about it, bring up your concerns to your cousin. ""Hey, your fiance was really aggressive about politics before. Are you sure my being there won't spark some kind of confrontation? I want to support you, but the last thing I want to see is another political rant because I showed up."" If this really is an issue, your cousin will know and hopefully provide you an excuse to decline the invitation.

&gt;What do I say if this happens again?

Nothing. Step away, don't engage. It's their wedding, and you're the bigger person for removing yourself from the situation if he starts to rant and rave. If that happens, EVERYONE will know it's him with the problem and you who took the high road."

Sounds like you guys are with each other just to be with someone... you sound like you resent him for how he's acted throughout the duration of the relationship so rather than end it you just keep calling his bluff.

"He didn't even directly say he was cheating, just to check with her before getting too into the idea of proposal. The way he did it certainly indicated something might be wrong, but it could just have been that he knew she wasn't on the same page yet. It has nothing to do with arrogance, and it is something that anyone would do for a really close friend."
"I'm on board with everything else you've written here (OP should help her access domestic violence support resources), but I want to say that calling a victim of abuse naive is 1) failing to understand how much abuse fucks up a person 2) cruel. "
"Do not worry about being accusatory, if it is something that you are sick about it's something that needs to be brought up. Ill advised would've been talking to a girl who was 16 for a few hours, not dating them for a year. Just because it is legal does not mean it is ethical. You need to find out as much as you can because when you are dealing with age of consent issues, if she was a minute underage when they had a relationship the law can come after him if the girl decided to go after that. 

If you explain to him your worry with him and he is open and upfront with you answering everything and leaving it all on the table then you have one answer, if he is defensive about it you have another one.   "
"Because all of the info you just gave could be a lie, or only partial truths. Because after he kidnaps her, he moves locations, or he was never in the location he said he was. Unless you have 100% verified proof of these things (aside from him just saying these things and telling you this woman was his mom, and not someone who is in on a kidnapping scheme), it's so, so easy to fake this information. 

You can, right now, make a new Facebook with a fake name, say you're from wherever you want, that you live wherever you want, that you go to whatever university you want, that you have whatever job you want, that you were born on whatever day you want, etc. "
"You say that you don't see having childhood toys as an adult to be immature, but that doesn't really ring true, since you say a few sentences later that you see her as less mature for it. I'd like for you to try and deconstruct why you are feeling the way that you are.

Why is it immature to be an adult and interact with a soft toy? What is the difference between that and, for example, playing an RPG? Are you feeling that it's odd because her playing with it is odd, or that you do not often see it and it is out of the ordinary? Are you feeling that it is immature because you associate soft toys with children? 

Her hesitation to share this with you indicates that she believed you would react negatively about it, or that she has received negative reactions in the past. 

Ultimately, what is the impact of her playing with this toy? Are you experiencing a lack of something due to this behavior?"
"Those aren't your friends.  They might have been your GF and friend's friends but they aren't your friends.  Pay them no heed and don't let them get in your head.

You can simply reiterate what you said here if pressed.  She cheated on you, and he broke your trust in the worst way.  You are fully justified in removing them from your life the way you did."

"Just tell him you are uncomfortable with it and he should be fine with stopping the comments and that should help abit.

I mean there always going to be hotter people than you. Tis life. Just remember that he is with you and not someone else."
"Did he agree that he's the one breaking/taking them?  If so, I'd say, ""Dude, chargers don't grow on trees.  You need to replace them.""  If he refuses, I think that that's a bad sign."
"This man will kill you. Let's say this relationship continues. Could you picture having kids with this man? Would you feel safe leaving them alone with him?

He pushed you into a bathtub and you blacked out. You are lucky you are alive. 

You need to leave this relationship. You will need to seek out information about how to leave an abuser. The period following a breakup is dangerous. DO NOT for any reason go and see him alone. 

I know it will be scary and hard to leave. But, you must. This man left to get high and wrecked your car and damaged his own brain. He is reckless. He was an ass before his injury. Now, he just has zero control.

He also has zero loyalty to you. He obviously still cares for his ex. 

He started dating you when you were 20. He targeted you because he knew he could control and manipulate you. Abusers can smell out their potential victim's insecurities.

Now. You are not weak. You have survived being abused in the past and you will survive this. You need to channel that strength and courage and leave.

You also need to seek out counselling. Please sign a contract with yourself that you will not date until you know your self worth. 

Sincerely, I wish you the best. Life isn't meant to live in fear. "
"This guy is working on your insecurities and self esteem issues and he is succeeding.The next time he makes a smart ass comment just reply ""If I was better looking or smarter I could get a better boyfriend""

If the man wanted to be in your and your son's life he'd be there. He doesn't because he isn't. File child support and move on with your life. Raise your kiddo best you can and when he gets bigger explain to him that his biological father must not have been ready to be a dad. 
"The issue isn't the actual number of past sexual partners. It's his terrible attitude. Commenting that you want to fuck other girls whilst out with your girlfriend is a huge red flag. This guy only sees women as sexual objects and deep down you know this which is why you aren't into sex with him. You shouldn't be trying to get over this, just get out of this relationship and find someone who values you for you."
"I've got a friend who ended a 2 year relationship because her boyfriend refused to say ""I love you"" because ""She knows it otherwise I wouldn't be with her"" they lived together and everything.   

She got out and so should OP"
"''. She reassures me I don't have anything to worry about, that her coworker just doesn't have anybody to talk about his open marriage with, and that I'm her ""Number one priority "", etc.''

 She flat out lied to your face without any problems. 

''So I confront her, and she's very remorseful and promises to never do it again.''

But later on you find out 

''they have been sexting and talking about their fantasies with each other again. I've also found out that both of them are in a closed Facebook group dedicated to sharing nudes, with both of them having posted their own pictures''

So she again lied to your face and felt nothing about it,not only that you find out there's more to it,sharing nudes on a facebook group.

''. My girlfriend knows she's toeing the line''

And she knows you are the type of person that takes her back every time she lies. 

''How can I begin to trust my girlfriend again? ''

You cannot and should not,she lied to your face again and again and STILL doing it,she has no respect for your relationship and she feels no remorse or guilt thats why she keeps doing it.

Wake up and stand up for yourself,why you wanna stay in a relationship like this?She is not worth your trust.Its your own life and here on reddit we do not know you or your girl personally but really in your case it  does not matter,run away from this woman man.

Good luck to you."
"Most people, judging by literally every thread about this sort of thing, would like to know if their partner is cheating on them. The very rare suicidal case doesn't change that, especially since they'd probably find out anyway.  

Besides, being told about cheating after (for example) one year is a lot worse than finding out after five years. "
"Yes, because beating your children is clearly the superior parenting method.  /s"

"...yes? I know? If she's miscarried before, it's possibly her preference, maybe they've even *discussed it!* &lt;gasp&gt;"
"I mean, I wonder how you're talking about it?  I don't usually brag about my kendo nidan, I don't go around saying ""I've been asked to be on my federation's team for Nationals again!"" to anyone but close friends or in conversations where it comes up organically.  And then my partner is a kung fu instructor of *real* skill, not my ""ten years practicing, going for my sandan again, nanakorobi yaoki!"" nonsense, and I have never once heard him refer to himself by his rank in polite company (nor does he ever say ""East Coast champion,"" nor does he say ""practicing for twenty years,"" or much of anything else at all unless there's a reason to be discussing martial arts in general.  The most he'll usually say would be ""Well,  if it's on Saturday I'll have to be late, because I have practice"").  

So while martial arts are a huge part of both of our lives, and our shared life together, and I only even *met* him because he's a martial artist, and he was interested in me in large part because he knew I'd understand where he was coming from...well, we've got a lot of other stuff to talk about, when we're not around other martial artists, and in meatspace we don't make a big deal about our practice even though between us we're in the kung fu school or dojo six or seven times a week.

&gt;It seems in the last few years, interest in martial arts has taken on an almost like ""nice guy,"" ""neck beard"" or even ""white knight"" association and it's just not cool to be involved with them.

I'd only agree halfway. *Obsession* with martial arts has been that way for a long time.  But actual practice?  Most of those guys are backyard samurai, cutting down their mama's weeds with their newest Final Fantasy wallhanger. Are you coming off like one of those dudes?

If you're talking about it like ""I'm lethal!"" or ""I've gotten in a lot of fights!"" or bragging about it, that might be a turnoff.

It might just come down to dating other kendoka, or other martial artists at leaast."
"I think a lot of people fall into that trap. I'm in a stem field, and lived on a student stipend in NYC for years. When I got my first job and my income doubled, things went a bit crazy. (I don't have two horses, but I have a cat, a three year old car, and a scuba certification.)"
"He's definitely being a guy lol. 
But he's also being more than a little inconsiderate. 

If he tries doing the titty fuck thing again, grab/stop him and ask him what he doesn't understand about you saying NO to something sexual? He's probably just in the moment and wants to act something out that porn has made seem really appealing, but he CANNOT ignore your lack of consent! That's a no-go. 
Optimistically, it sounds like he was trying to support your boobage to the best of his ability, but got a little too carried away with being honest. 🙄Pessimistically, it sounds like he's a real asshole and poking fun at something he knows you're insecure about. Like, boarderline ""negging."" Be direct with him about it if he says something similar and ask ""How do you think that makes me feel?"" Make him think about what he's saying.

He could just be clueless about how much his words/actions are affecting you, but if he continues after you get more direct about how he's making you feel, then it's time to. Move. On. "
"&gt; Because she's inexperienced and should be free to have sex on her own terms, without some horny dude pressuring her into it.

If she doesnt want a sexual relationship, she should break up with him.  Why does that make him a douchebag? Why is his position unreasonable?

You a projecting big time here. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting a relationship to be sexual aged 17.  In fact, being realistic, no relationship at that age will last long term, so the MAIN reasons for being in one are emotional and physical intimacy.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with his position or approach, nor would there be anything wrong with OP breaking up with him over it.

Seems really weird to me that for you, he isnt ""allowed"" to value sex in a relationship or be open about that, or that expressing a dealbreaker is ""being a horny dude pressuring her"""
[removed]
"He's NOT PRESSURING HER. He said that if she's sure she doesn't want to do it, they should break up. Just because she might try to pressure HERSELF into having sex with him to keep the relationship, doesn't mean that he's wrong for having sex be a deal breaker. It's almost as if you didn't read anything else in the comment aside from that. Their age DOESNT make a difference. Whether she's 16, or 26, if she's not ready, she's not ready and shouldn't be pressured. He also shouldn't feel pressured to stay in a relationship that doesn't meet his needs for fear of being ridiculed as some horny asshole. "
"Be prepared for him yo be so wrapped up in his superiority that he dismisses all the comments, accuses you of writing a biased post, etc. But it's a good Hail-Mary ""is this salvageable"" litmus test, I guess."
"Haha, yea, I'm just speaking to the ""ownership"" aspect. They're broken up. She can decide what's appropriate to keep. What he considers ""shared"" just isn't between them two anymore. I probably shouldn't have gone there though. Just making a point. "
"I agree. Personally, if someone who is very frugal about their own items bought me a gift that expensive I think I'd feel guilty. OP has no reason to feel guilty, of course, but yeah. I don't know if I could wear a $2k ring while my love wore 2nd hand clothes, even by choice. The anxiety over losing or damaging it would be awful. "

"Some of what you said here is irrelevant leading me to believe we might be having a misunderstanding.

Boyfriend is not horrible, but his actions that day were. There are consequences for doing horrible things. Part of the consequences are that OP no longer trusts his sober words, and constantly replays the event in her head over and over. Therapy might help push the replays to the back of her mind, but she will never forget. That memory will always be there. That pain will always follow their relationship. There is nothing either of them can do to change the trauma that he caused."
"Well, then I suggest you suck it up and do what he wants, because he will not change, his sexual desires won't change, and this is what the rest of your married life is going to be, because you refuse to leave him.  You can't change him, he's 46, he will not change.  So I guess all you can do is follow his orders, or deal with his anger.

I mean, you could stand up for yourself and leave him.  But you won't do that.  But luckily he'll die well before you, so you'll have some years of freedom, probably in your 50s or 60s."

"&gt; My brother will obviously never turn himself in. My sister tells him to go abroad and then give the money back and confess, so that I can use that so solve my situation and he gets to be in my shoes with respect to not being able to come back.

Well your family has a choice then.

If they want their non-criminal family member to be a part of the family they can turn the brother in a fix (to the extent it can be fixed) problem.

Or they can shun their non-criminal family member for a criminal family member and excommunicate you to Europe.

Their choice.  (And obviously it seems like they are siding with the criminal).

Other than they, you really have nothing to discuss with them.  They sided with your brother.  Every time they call, make that clear.  Fix it.  Then hang up.

"The only time I've seen a PI suggested is when the couple is actually married, and the idea is to get evidence for a divorce. The suggestion is usually rebutted with the fact that most states are no fault, and evidence of cheating won't affect the settlement or child custody. I don't agree with those suggestions to begin with, but there's some justification there for people unfamiliar with the legal system.

However, OP isn't married. She doesn't have kids with this guy. There's not even a sliver of acceptable reasoning that could justify needing to hire a PI, which is why it's much more unacceptable in this case. "

"I think there is a higher likelihood of failure for relationships started as affairs, but your relationship isn't doomed to failure. 

Instead of obsessing about his ex-wife, I think you should focus on the things that could cause problems for your relationship in the future. When Aidan's previous relationship went through a difficult period, he didn't handle it in an honest or healthy way. It sounds like your relationship is doing well now, but you will eventually hit a rough patch or dull period. That's inevitable. When that happens, you want Aidan to handle it better this time. To work with you, communicate honestly, and stick around. On your side, you also had some issues. You talked yourself into doing something you don't believe was right and you did so because of the period  you were going through in your life. How can you develop healthier coping mechanisms so you don't justify poor behavior to yourself the next time you go through a difficult part of your life? 

As for your guilt, you need to find a healthy way to deal with it. You did something you believe was wrong. At this point, it sounds like you can't really make amends to the person you wronged because she likely wouldn't welcome that and it would complicate the co-parenting relationship. Maybe deal with the guilt by (1) working to fix the parts of yourself that allowed you to do something you believe was immoral and (2) doing some good deeds in the world. "

Third you now know that your gf doesn't consider your investment in time in searching worth anything. 

Lastly, you just learned that she's willing to make life altering choices without any real thought suddenly. That sort of rash reckless behavior is a massive red flag.

No, this needs to be worked out between you, your mother, and the other person paying/coordinating the vacation.

"Thanks!
Everyone is different, so if/once he starts asking questions you're kind of on your own. 

Honestly, I see nothing wrong with a high number of partners, but that may not be the case with him. 

I'd spin the answer a little rather than give it to him straight. Something like ""How many do I not regret? About 3. Most of the others were the result of too much vodka and me desperately hoping I'd be happy with myself if someone thought I was pretty enough to take home."" 

One key thing with all this is no war stories with friends. If you're going to say you're embarrassed about your past, then no laughing along when a friend tells a story like ""Oh my god, remember when we went home with that guy who had the hot tub and he came out wearing a beer box for a swimming suit???""

Also, prepare for your fiance to see you promiscuous past as increasing the possibilities of a sexually adventurous future. There may be some jealousy of ""You had a threeway with some random dude and your friend Sara, but you won't even consider it with me? Why does this asshole you say don't even like get three ways and I don't?"" 

There's pretty much no good answer for that because the truth is, while you might have been miserable, some random dude got to do crazier things with you than your fiance did. (I assume) All you can really do is stress how miserable you were and how much better your fiance makes you feel."

"&gt; Regarding the bruising, that could be a big deal or not. 

Are you serious?  I bruise easy too.  I will wake up sometimes with bruises and wonder where i got it........but like i said:  I HAVE NEVER BEEN BRUISED BY SOMEONE HELPING ME. 

You keep trying to normalize the BF's behavior for some reason and its disturbing.  Look at the story OP paints - this guy has massive anger issues and has now escalated to the point of physically taking it out on his GF.  "
I made that mistake before. Bacon hurts.
Maybe she's just being ridiculous and sometimes it's okay to point that out. This being one of those times. 
"Please believe this, OP. Your BF is abusive. He isn't sorry. He thinks he was in the right. He thinks that injuring you is justified, that you deserved it because you did something he didn't like. This is a dangerous mindset--the mindset of an abusive partner. He needs serious therapy, but he also needs to not be in a relationship with *anyone* right now until he fixes his serious issues. Right now he isn't even acknowledging that he has issues, so he has a very long way to go and may never take responsibility and get help. *You* need to get yourself out of there. There are healthy relationships out there, and you deserve a healthy and loving relationship. "
Move on? There are more fish in the sea.
Yeah and that's why OP's analogy to braces makes sense. I think it just scares the boyfriend because he loves her the way she is and he's seen all these horror stories about people who can't stop going under the knife once they start.

And if she were here asking how avoid this in her next relationship, I'd tell her to bring up her thoughts about the future earlier. But again: She's not. OP is. 

And sure, OP can continue to date women for several months and then drop the bomb that it's not going anywhere, if he's cool with blowing up one relationship after another. But it sounds like he's not super thrilled with the way this went down, so I'm giving him a pretty solid way to avoid repeating it in the future. "
"People say nothing in life is black and white, but once you get out of an abusive relationship, you learn that abuse truly is black and white. It is a deliberate crossing of another human being's boundary and it is done in a way that looks crazy. It's something Lundy Bancroft talks about in length. Most women (if not all) say that the abusive episodes were always so crazy! He was yelling and he was all over the place and it didn't make sense etc. etc. They'll say it was insanity. After multiple incidents they'll wonder if he's undiagnosed bipolar. But what people who study abusive men and work with abusive men will tell you is that it's not crazy in the least. It's always methodical and with a purpose. And it starts with insane incidents like this because it's so easy to chalk it up to him just having a moment. My ex husband's first two episodes of yelling at me were over 1. a missing glass in the cupboard from a set of 6 glasses and 2. the dishwasher having soap remnants in it. It was crazy insane yelling that seemed just sooooo intense but really incredibly wild and out of character over things that were so asinine. It was SO EASY to forget about the incidents and move on especially after he would apologize because hey, who doesn't have a bad day once in a while? But like I said, while most things in life aren't black and white, abuse is. And once you get out of an abusive relationship, it's so clear when someone is just ""having a bad day"" vs. when someone is starting to show their true colors. Please be careful. I fear he is starting to show his true colors. Set your boundaries in stone and do not let him cross them. "
"&gt;A couple paid a LOT in different cities and he wasn't comfortable with my making that much more than him and got upset (communicated this to me, knowing it was irrational).

So he's sexist too? What a catch! He has basically made it known that he doesn't accept the idea of a housewife OR a woman with a successful career, where does that leave you? Your husband is supposed to support you being the best you can be, not weigh you down and stifle your potential."
Exactly this. Get a notebook and write it down each time she calls you with as much detail as you can remember. Or you can email yourself after each call with the same information. Keep multiple backup copies in safe locations. Stay two steps ahead of her at all times.
"For what it's worth, perfectly straight teeth is very, very localized to the Americas. Its popularity is starting to spread, but, like, much of the world doesn't really care too much if your teeth are a little crooked or yellow. A lot of kids are forced through unnecessary pain and their parents through immense expense for braces that often just aren't needed. It's worth problematizing, I think."
"If she was a good mom she would say 'im proud of you and we will be fine.'

She sucks and is trying to blame you for her sucking.  You dont even know who you are yet, because you havent started living yet.  Just school &amp; chores for years.  You fought for every second of free time, every book read, every moment of peace.  

Talk to some friends, ask them to help you get these plans made.  Reach out to people who respect you."

"I have been doing a bit of that.  I am sometimes suddenly busy when she invites herself to a group outing. And I was vague last night when I was describing the class - I wasn't sure if I would sign up, and I wasn't sure what night it was, and I didn't know when the class began.  That sort of thing.

"This happened to me with Woodstock '94 and my bf at the time wanted that *boys* weekend. In retrospect, I should have told him to piss off because I missed a great line up of some of my favourite bands. It's something I regret.

If you want to go to this festival, go. You're going with your friends and you don't need permission from anyone to do something you've been wanting to do since last year. Besides, your campsite will be elsewhere on the grounds. It's unfair of him to expect you to miss out on an opportunity you were also looking forward to. As for his buddy being upset with him because Sarah is going, not your problem. It's Sarah's ex-boyfriends problem and they're making it yours. This isn't a boys night out bar crawl, this is a music festival that happens once a year. You're young... Go out and have fun, live life on your terms and have no regrets!

You've been with this guy 8 months. Trying to establish a relationship with the child's mother is beyond inappropriate. You probably shouldn't even be in the child's life on a daily basis at this point - it's way too early for that and very irresponsible.

She's made it clear that she doesn't want to communicate with you. Stop trying to force it. You're already forcing too much."
"You and your friends sound like a good group of kids, but there's a strong chance here that you will eventually have to cut your friend out of the group. I know you all are trying to do the right thing by being his friend, but there are some battles than can't be won. 

I hate to be this person, because I wish I could believe that everyone can learn and change and be friends with each other, but there's a reason why you guys were his last resort for friendship."
"Oh come on, don't do this to yourself, seriously, don't.

Did he hit you?  Did he manipulate you?  Did he purposely make you feel badly about yourself?  If yes, then it was abusive.

It doesn't matter why he left.  Maybe he had a bit of clarity and saw that he was being awful to you.  Maybe he got bored and went on to find another victim.  Maybe he found someone 10x prettier than you.  Who knows, who cares?

Sounds like you already had enough evidence to warrant a restraining order. File a police report and go to the courts and get one. Don't wait cause it's likely to get worse.

"First off, you're a great sister for considering this. And it's totally a no-brainer that your brother would be better off out of that house.

However - without meaning to denigrate your intentions or abilities - I really don't think you're equipped to handle a mentally distressed teenage boy all by yourself.

Before you agree to this, make sure you have some kind of a support system in place. I expect your brother's teacher/school would be willing to work with you, and could probably point you toward other resources as well.

Also, finances: could you swing this on your own earnings if you have to, or would you be screwed if your unstable mother suddenly cut off all financial support? Remember that looking after your brother is probably going to cut into your bartending.

You might also want to consider partial solutions, for instance he stays at yours x nights a week.

It's commendable that you want to break him out of that toxic situation. But if you don't lay the groundwork, you're probably setting yourself up for a massive fail that might even leave him worse off than before.

tl;dr: sometimes due diligence is the highest form of love."
Have you guys considered hiring a doula for the birth? It's going to be difficult for you no matter what given the circumstances and maybe an additional support person who is focused 100% on your wife and knows the circumstances would be really helpful in getting through in the most positive way possible. 
"What on earth are you talking about?

I didn't keep her - I surrendered her to a legal shelter to be claimed. She never was, so I adopted her rather than let her sit in that shelter. I paid for necessary medical procedures like spay and vaccinations that the owners hadn't done. 

Your reasoning breaks down considering this is an animal we're talking about. It's not my personal standards of care that are a concern - we're talking basic, minimally necessary procedures and medical upkeep.

*If* I decide it's in the dog's best interest to go back to her previous owners, yes, it would be right for them to reimburse me. It's not comparable for me to pay them for previous care if I decide to keep the dog. I wasn't responsible for her then - they were. If I decide to surrender my responsibility of the dog back to them, I should be made whole for the costs I shouldn't have incurred if they had taken care of her correctly. It's not a hill I'd die on if it came to it, but it is what's right."
"Your comment that she feels you only want to see her for sex is sticking out to me. I wonder if she is frustrated/resentful and truly thinks that is why you want to see her.if it's truly how she feels and not just a 'in the moment' for that conversation feeling than that feeling may be killing her mood more. 

She also sounds like she has a lower sex drive, the other thought was maybe it's not doing it for her. Is she open with you on what she wants/likes? What 

Those were my original thoughts but after that paragraph I think when she said that to you that is the main problem, she feels that's the reason you are with her. Did you talk in depth about that? Ask why she feels that way and what would help her feel like you want her and not just for sex?"
"This may be my only option. I don't love the idea of it, and the boundaries on times have been pushed time and again, but it may have to be the solution. "

Don't out your son to your bigoted husband. Dump your bigoted husband. Be there for your son. 
"&gt;Do I tell my husband as he has a right to know, but risk him ostracizing our son completely, or do we keep it from him, but our son will have to lead a ""straight"" life in front of his dad, and if he ever finds out he'll never forgive either of us?

Leave it up to your son how he wants to play it. Support his decision either way. Your husband can know when and if your son is willing to tell him."
"I gave my friend hell for going back to her horrible ex. Straight up said, ""You are being a FUCKING IDIOT"". I told her I'd be happy to see her and talk, but I didn't want to hear a damn word about him. I don't want to hear a complaint or even an anecdote about ""their"" day. And he certainly isn't welcome any place that I happen to be in. 

It's worked out so far. We chat, I don't have to hear about him. If someone wants to slam their hand repeatedly in a car door, I am under no obligation to watch. "
"&gt; They didn't impose, we were just talking and it got late. I feel like I'm in Bizarro land here. Does everyone here need formal invitation to hang out with their family? Because that sounds ridiculous to me.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It's not mandatory or anything. It's just a causal family hangout, you know, like normal people have.

And she just casually went to her book club. If your family dropping by like that is sooooo casual, then I really don't see any problem with her going to her book club. Everything being so casual and all, you know, like normal people do. Or are you implying she should conform to your family when they casually drop by and change her plans on the spot? Seems bizarrely, to use your words again, too casual to be forced to change planed out activities like that.

I mean, there is an easy solution. If you want her to not have plans and go to activities when your family ""casually"" (ugh, sigh &gt;_&lt; ) drops by, then maybe, just maaaaaybe, visits need to be planed out in advance. "

"Do you have a financial planner or anyone that helps you manage your money? Because another business isn't an exit plan, and when you're making as much money as you are, it almost always helps to have another set of eyes on it."
I don't think the pictures really matter. It's the emotional blackmailing that's coming with you not giving them. He shouldn't be whining about feeling unloved or whatever. He's just trying to manipulate you.

"Wanting quality, especially in a product that you'll use every day, isn't being materialistic. And I don't think shelling out a couple hundred bucks for an important purchase is going to fund a trip either. People can travel and have experiences while also owning nice things, it's not an all or nothing type situation. "
"OP has no idea if she's actually uninformed though. He can't even bring up sex around her but is surprised that she would say she had a ""strong feeling"" instead of saying she was wet or turned on. Especially if sex is taboo in her house those are terms she's probably too shy to use.

I doubt anybody would assume that a dude with a boner has no idea what's happening. I really doubt this girl has no idea what's happening. Cause and effect is easy. Girls understand it too. We don't need a body part to stick up like a flagpole to be aware of it. 

I also have no idea what OP feels he needs to explain. From his post it really sounds like he wants to tell her that her ""strong feelings"" means she's aroused. If that's what he wants to explain- why?? "
"But her failure results in shit for OP.

If he leaves the trash there, then he lives in a house that reeks of garbage.  If he leaves his jacket unironed, then he's the one wearing a wrinkly jacket.

If being fired isn't enough of a consequence, then nothing will be.

And who the hell doesn't feed their kids?  

I'd divorce yesterday."
"It's not the wrong answer for everyone. OP needs to talk to his wife again but surely if she's saying she doesn't want anything, he should respect that?

A friend who had difficult pregnancies and a couple of miscarriages also didn't celebrate anything until baby was safely born. OP's wife needs to decide, and OP needs to go with that"
"If she has ADD or ADHD it's still no excuse for this kind of behavior.  Most employers would've nipped this problem in the bud right away even if she started coming in only 10 minutes late every day.  ADD or not she's still expected to be responsible, both at work and at home.  She is allowing the TV to distract her from life.  Unacceptable.  Does she need the TV removed like a child?  

Honestly it sounds like ultimatum time, but I'm not sure how with two kids in the mix.  She sounds like she needs to live by herself for a while, with no one to rely on but herself.  She's supposed to be a partner in life, but she sounds like nothing but a drain, and now she can't pull her weight financially, either.  You can't fix her unless she wants to be fixed."
"Oh yeah, I know it's much harder for some people than others - true of nearly everything, right? And being high functioning in some ways (whether you have depression, ADHD or anything else) can be as much a curse as a blessing because you can prevent people, including yourself, from realising something is wrong until you burn out completely. 

And OP's wife may not have ADHD, but it seems likely she's got SOMETHING."
"If she seems indifferent she probably has depression. Either way leaving is probably best, you can't force someone with depression to get help. Losing her job should be a huge wakeup call."

"Two points, from where I'm looking at things:

1) Your mother waited until the last minute to ask you if you were visiting her for Mother's Day. At this point, had you already either actively committed or implied to your girlfriend that you would be spending the day with her and her friends on Sunday? If so, I agree with your girlfriend that backing out of the plans you had with her and her guests is unfair. Had you wanted to spend time with your mom on Mother's Day, you should have made that known well before. 

2) Your girlfriend severely overreacted, based on the information you've provided. This is an entirely different issue. I personally wouldn't want to be in a relationship where arguments got so intense. 

If I were you, I would address each issue separately. How you do so is dependent on how you want to proceed with your relationship. "
"This is a great comment, thank you. My kid is only young but thanks for pointing out actions speak louder than words, so true, it's easy to think you're doing the right thing just by saying it but reactions to everyday stuff probably mean so much more. Good to keep in mind. "
"You need to seriously upgrade the quality of the dude you're trying to fuck. This is a non-issue to an actual mature adult. These douchebags didn't deserve to be with you.


Also, own that shit. Make a Hunger Games joke about it. ""Literally the Girl on Fire"" would make a great online dating headline."
"From what you've said, it doesn't really sound like you want to work on rebuilding a relationship with your sister (which seems fair to me, imo, after reading your OP edit). To be fair, you did kind of bury the lede -- i can see why people are responding like this having not read the edit, it makes the situation a lot clearer. 

It sounds like you came here to ask whether or not you're a bad person for not wanting to invite her to your wedding. That was my reading, anyway. I don't personally think you are, she does seem to be committed to being the center of attention to the point of ruining your events. "
Then you need to stand firm though her being emotional about it and actually find out why she won't and then decide if it is something you are willing to live without
"This! Supporting change in a relationship is healthy, expecting change is not. You've gotta love him for who he is. 

That said, his diet is weird and not really healthy. Suggesting he try a bite of your food every so often to see if he will branch out is a good idea. BUT make it a light suggestion, don't insist, and don't be upset if he refuses. 

He sounds like a good guy otherwise, so maybe if you want someone to go to new restaurants and try new things with, you could go with a friend? That way he's not ordering food he doesn't eat, you don't have to eat breakfast all the time, and you get to discuss your awesome meal with another foodie type."
"Then ASK her, dude. This is your WIFE. You need to know things about her career. For example, my wife is a lawyer. For a few years, she had a high-paying, high-stress job at a law firm. After a while, the stress started to wear her down more than the pay was rewarding her, so we sat down and figured out how to make it work for her to have a lower-paying but less stressful job. I agreed that more of the household expenses would come from my earnings, while she agreed that she would do more of the work around the house since I'm now working longer hours than her. There needs to be a give and take like that in any relationship."
"The fact that she missed her exam last time is her problem. 

Her coming down immediately, when you are in a highly emotional frame of mind, instead of a few days after to give you some space is also not good. 

Break up with her. If you move near her, she'll have more control of you and you'll have less of an escape. If she misses her exams, again, that's her problem. Why are you letting her put the fault for everything at your door? "
"Yes, I'm thought about that aswell. I'm even willing to date her while she is still working as enscort. Maybe that's weird, but I can live with that. It does not bothers me.
It would bother me if she did not tried to get out of it. Like, if after year of dating she would still work as an escort. After that I would be prepared to propably end it because of it. (But talking with her about it of course)

She even has to accept me as I'm right now. She works as en escort. And I visited an escort. She will have some doubt thoughts about me aswell... Like, he did it once, will he do it again? etc. I'm prepared for that.

Thank you for the advice. It really helped me and it gave me some confidence. I'm prepared for that she will refuse. But as you said, I have nothing to lose. And one last question, if you don't mind. Do you think that it will be better to tell her everything? Like that I already have some strong feelings for her etc.? Or will it be better to keep it to myself, and just tell her casualy that I would like to ask her for an date? 
You propably cannot answer that because every woman is different, but thoughts are running in my head and I feel like me few years ago, when I asked the first girl for a date...

Thanks"
Thank you! I think that's the part I'm dreading. Actually saying no to my cousin and my family because it's not something that I say often enough.
"To me, this sounds like you guys have a relationship (you're emotionally close and you're fucking). Now he's got another relationship on the side, and that sucks.

What do you want? Do you want a girlfriend? Or a boyfriend? Would you want to have an out relationship with the guy you're with now? Would he even be down for that?

To me, it sounds like you are hung up on this one guy and he's keeping you from meeting other people who are willing to have a more full relationship (or even better sex). Leaving this relationship may mean changing your own image of your sexuality, but you'll need to if you want to be more than this guy's side piece."
"Not overreacting at all. This guy is a narcissist. No empathy, puts himself  first always, no sense of understanding. These things won't change. You need someone there unconditionally and this dude is there for himself. 
I'm sorry. It might be good to live with family whom care and love you. "

"Days without communication shouldn't be acceptable in any relationship.

I can understand needing space for a few hours, but I think going days with out communication is pretty extensive 
""space"". You wanting to talk more than that is **not** clingy.

I think you need to sit down and talk to him about this issue. Tell him you're willing to give him space sometimes, but going that long without talking o him at all isn't something you're okay with. If he isn't willing to compromise, he's telling you all you need to know."
"I would question anyone who *wouldn't* break up with someone who not only intentionally got them sick (it doesn't matter if it's not cancer-grade illness), but thought it was funny.  He derives pleasure from her suffering.  If he punched her in the face and laughed about it, everyone would tell her to leave.  This is no different."
"Do whatever you can to prevent this. Setting aside the possible implications of her leaving the country in the future, it's not smart, sane, healthy or even safe for her to go through with this. It also sounds like fraud may be involved if he's from out of the country, and they plan on getting married but not living together.

I had a high school friend who nearly threw her life away doing this (moving across the country to shack up with/marry an internet bf she barely knew), and fortunately, her parents were able to convince her to wait, and have him move in with them. Turned out, once they got to know each other in person, he was an abusive, videogame addicted jerk who refused to work and planned on making her support him so he could spend literally 10+ hours a day playing minecraft. He also had some bizarre fetishes I won't go into that he tried to make her act out, even though she was uncomfortable.

Fortunately, because he was living with her family, when he inevitably cheated on her with someone as fucked up as him, she hadn't thrown away her college career, her family connections etc. Had she moved across the country and been with him when this went down, idk what could have saved her.

I only elaborate on all this to say that, even if it's not a worst case scenario where something illegal or shady is happening, this is likely to go SO, SO badly. You should never marry someone you don't know in person. It compromises your safety. Do whatever you can to save your sister from this, and if she goes through with it, have an action thing with her for what to do when things go south. This may involve some money, a passport, and an escape plan."
"You can suggest that your mom make new friends by joining a club or meetup group. You can't make your sister be closer to your mother. She's already aware of that desire on your mom's part and she's choosing not to be your mom's best friend, and that's sad but it's okay. 

You seem to have fallen into the role of being the family ""fixer."" I've been there. It feels comforting to think you have the power to keep your family together and happy, but nobody has that power. You gotta let people make their own decisions. As for you, maybe do some self-reflection on why you've assumed this role and what feelings of your own you might be suppressing by managing everyone else's feelings (and ways of coping with your dad's death) instead."

You think YOU cheating on him will make things better?

Unlike a lot of people on r/relationships I believe some relationships can survive infidelity.... A partner gets drunk, fucks up, and feels terrible and tells his/her partner about it immediately, BUT that is NOT what happened here.

he hid it from you and would have continued hiding it if his ex didn't contact you. how can you possibly ever trust him again?

Please break up with him. Your relationship is going to end anyway, so please don't drag this out longer than you have to... You've already wasted 2 years with this man. I'll bet you $20 in a year from now you two will no longer be speaking with one another."
"&gt; I don't feel a moral obligation to pay it 

Lol too bad moral obligations aren't legal obligations. Like do you think everyone feels morally obligated to pay taxes?

If the kid is born you're paying. That's just the reality of the situation. You took the condom off, you fertilized the embryo. 

Your best bet is a paternity test and a counselor to help you make the major mental shift you need to gain some personal responsibility. You're not a victim, you're half of a cause. 

Lawyer up. Get a paternity test. Get a therapist. Start owning your actions. "
"*Does your sister want to never get a car from your dad? Because this is how you never get a car from your dad.*

The fact that your sister is trying to ruin something beautiful for your parents because of her own selfishness must be incredibly frustrating. If your sister doesn't apologize to your dad, she's never getting a car from him.

If you think she'll listen to you, then I'd give it a go - remind her that she isn't entitled to a car and if she ever hopes to get one (or help for buying one from your dad), that she needs to apologize and remember that the world doesn't revolve around her. That she should be happy your parents are still so in love and made it this far together after having you two so young.

If she tries to ruin this by telling your mom, I'd suggest to your dad that he move his timeline up a bit. It will be crushing to both your parents that your sister is behaving this way, but that way they can still have a nice moment. Offer to run interference with your sister as much as you can, if you feel comfortable.

"I'm sorry, you were drunkenly, loudly fighting in a restaurant where your wife threw up a couple times and then injured herself, and hysterically cried at the table?! W. T. F. If that's how you both behave you have bigger problems than what her family thinks of you. And frankly, that isn't going to change, no matter what you say or do. Family doesn't want to believe the ugly side of their daughter/relative. And that's pretty damn ugly. Easier to believe you hit her, tripped her, made her want to get away from you and she fell, etc rather than she's an embarrassing drunk who should never step foot inside a restaurant again. "

"I can totally understand being asked to pay.  Paying is not the issue at all.  The issue is that I told my mom what I wanted in return for paying our share, and they went behind us without asking what we could afford or giving us any choice at all, and booked exactly what I told her we would not pay for."
"My father is the one that tells them these things.

When I feel comfortable, I have them meet my family and it's clear that we have wealth (several homes, new vehicles every couple of years). Then the comments/questions start after we leave. Over time, I get proposed to (I've been proposed to over 5 times and stupidly I accepted most of them not realizing sooner that these men were not genuine), and when they have ""the talk"" with my father the money seems to come up.

So I fixed the problem... My current husband didn't have the talk with my dad- we just eloped. And did so after I knew that the potential of money (because it's never guaranteed) didn't mean more to him than I did."
"My ex wanted to do the mommy/daddy thing and it is really awkward. After the break up, I found out he was actually was sexually assaulted by his mother. I'm glad the night we broke up, I told him he needed help because he had mommy issues. I never knew it was due to a sexual assault but I am glad I got that out of the way. 

It is a lot of stress and at 18, that is something you definitely don't need. You need to let him know you cannot handle this and he needs help."
"&gt; It got to the point where we deliberately sabotaged his pictures just to make him stop

I never thought of this, or at least acting on it due to (perceived) fear of having the process start all over again for a redo. As a kid it was easier to practice saying ""just take the picture!"" through gritted teeth and a forced smile for the entire time."
"You're justifying cheating... The thing is, a _lot_ of people believe they are actually in love when they cheat on their SOs; it doesn't make it right.  It doesn't make it less hurtful to that other person, it doesn't make that STD go away, it doesn't get rid of the secret pregnancy, etc. Cheating is selfish, and nobody deserves that."
"When you text her, she replies. Correct? You, however, want her to take the initiative instead for .. reasons.. even though you are the one who really cares about the morning text thing. Correct? 

You are being unreasonable if I read that correctly. "
"This is something you need to talk to your father about, not Cynthia. Maybe your mother can help too. Sit them both down, without Cynthia, and explain your feelings."
he doesn't even beat her!
"That's a very nice way to put it. I think Jake has a very healthy relationship with his money and how to spend it. I agree that he obviously loves me and wanted to express that. 

Yeah you are not the first person in my life to have said that actually. Or even like, the fourth person. I don't know. We were at home, sitting on the couch after a lovely roast dinner he made for me, and he said ""okay are you finally ready for your present?"" Then he shoved the little box at me and watched as I opened it (upside down lol, no ones ever given me a ring box before!). Then I stared in shock at him, then at the ring, then back at him until he asked if I liked it (yes) and said ""I wasn't sure about a diamond ring... But I wanted to get you something that you'd really like"". So I don't think it was an aborted proposal. "

"As others said, do not wait. You need to call this very instant, every single second you waste is time that this kid does not have to spare."
"Sorry that I wasn't clear on that. I had put a note beside ""flu shots"" but have now made it more obvious. In NZ they're usually all lumped together.

**That** is what I'm upset about, that he's putting his mild dislike of needles above the health of those around him. I understand that he gets to make his own medical decisions, but that doesn't mean they can't be for selfish, ignorant reasons.

He does not believe that vaccines cause autism, though he seemed unsure when we met. When I explained that one is born with autism, so it can't possible be caused by vaccines, and that the person who said that made up their data, he understood.

One of our problems is that he sometimes has opinions on things that he knows nothing about, and can be stubborn about accepting knowledge I have a better understanding of.

I will ask him those questions. Thank you for bringing them up."
"As a oldest kid, I can tell you that a lot of the time this stems from your parents putting you in that role when you are younger. From the time my younger siblings were born, I was changing diapers, putting on their shoes, helping them with their homework, etc. Your parents ask you to be helpful, and you want to be a good kid, so you do.

You also get held accountable for the things your siblings do wrong. You should have stopped them, you should have told me, you're older and you should know better. 

To your siblings, you become a parent who can't punish them. They come to you with their problems to solve because they want help, but they know they won't be in trouble. When you're an older sibling, you always have to choose between your loyalty to your siblings and your loyalty to your parents. 

My sister once told me to stop acting like her mom (not that I don't understand that this wasn't an easy position for her, either). It was hard because she still expected me to make her dinner, help her clean her room, help her with her homework, do her make up when she wanted to go out, etc. My brothers still come to me when they get into trouble, or to iron their clothes before job interviews, or to borrow money when their cars break down. 

Now part of me knows that I shouldn't do these things for them, but I love them so much and it genuinely makes me feel good to help them.

Anyway, my point is that your sister doesn't do his because she is a controlling person who wants to run your life. She feels responsible for you because that's the role that your family created for her. Your family created a role for you where you are the baby and need to be helped and supervised. 

It's a really common family dynamic. Talk to your sister about it. But first, consider all the things that she has done for you over your life. I bet its more than you realize (a lot you might not remember from when you were a baby). Don't feel guilty about it, just use that to have a little compassion when you do talk to her. Somebody put her in this role, and I bet she was just doing what she thought was best based on her role in the family dynamic.

Just say to her, ""Thank you for everything you have done for me, and for being there for me. But I feel like I have three parents and it is putting a lot of pressure on me.""

My sister said something like this to me, and even though we still fall back into our old dynamic sometimes, it's much easier to fix now that we've spoken about it. 

Because she was so nice about it, it didn't damage our relationship and we're closer than ever. 

Every birth-order kid has their own burden to escape from because of it, and I know it's not any easier to be a younger kid in this dynamic. I just hope you try to be as kind as possible to preserve your relationship. When you get older, your siblings are often the most reliable and trustworthy people in your life and I want that for you in the future."
"Trust me, he'd move out now if he could. He doesn't have the finances for it right now, but he is going to be moving in September. That's a long time to wait for this situation to develop.

And I completely agree with you the money needs to be spent. That doesn't address the issue at all of his parents not even acknowledging the seriousness of the issue. How can we convince them to spend that money when they don't think it's a problem?"
"&gt;I feel the same way. I caught myself holding back while I was with friends last night

If his abuse is so bad your personality is changing, please, please, please leave him."
"Some dudes are just Bachelor dudes for life.  They don't like girls picking off their bro's.  Sounds like your BFs friend/roommate could be this dude.  I wouldn't waste my time trying to win his approval or disapproval.  Don't let the friend become the center of your relationship. 

I'd just express this to your BF. Express that while your not happy your best friend doesn't like you, you'd appreciate if you could stick up for me, but past that let's have the relationship about us, not him. "
"&gt;If it's Lync/Skype for Business, it can be awkward to ignore people if your status is ""available."" 

It's awkward for her to discuss religion with her 50 year old coworker, too. Just because you're ""available"" doesn't mean you're sitting at your desk twiddling thumbs. 
"
"&gt; Granted, I'm polyamorous and so in a different demographic

This is not meant as an attack on you, but these comments show up on this sub all the time and it seems really obvious to me that your perspective as a poly person is really, really not relevant to somebody pursuing a monogamous relationship when the topic is *specifically* having sex with other people. "
"From my experiences around that sort of element, it's kinda a lot like being a civilian around military people. You don't get the references or the jokes and the *culture* can be really foreign. Yes, by their rules, Jimmy paid his dues. Does not work that way elsewhere and it can be super jarring. 

They KNOW you are not from or familiar with their world. They are using it to tease you. It is fair game to tease back. They start talking about drug dealing, you go, ""I'm meeting a financial adviser to discuss 401K options! ... ... Sorry. I have no idea what to say to drug dealing stories... Oh, one time I took more than the recommended dose of the pills they gave me after my wisdom tooth extraction?"""
"So, in the past, she would be upset if you were gaming and she asked you to go out on an unscheduled spontaneous date night with her and you didn't want to miss your gaming session? And now, you're upset because she didn't miss a planned yoga session to go out on a spontaneous date night with you? 

And you don't see how when you say ""now, when I'm trying, she's being inflexible. It feels like a double standard"" sounds hypocritical? "
"&gt; why not just give him a list of things you'd like that he can choose from?

If you read the post it says she has an Amazon wish list. "
Yeah - things like that are rarely actual jokes - their either warnings or boundary tests.
"So, she is a high stress person who drove herself over the brink with work, and now she wants to drive you over the brink with work.  I think you need to set up some simple procedures and boundaries to both calm her and prevent her from stressing all over you.

1. Limit the times when finances can be discussed.  No more multiple daily inquiries.  Once a month, once a week, something like that.  She does not need to discuss it more often than that.

2. Pay yourself a steady ""salary.""  You have variable income from your business, so you should pay yourself a steady amount every month.  Leave the excess in another account, either your personal account as a reserve, or a business account, depending on how you do recordkeeping.  Lean months, flush months, doesn't matter - you get the same monthly draw.  Periodically, maybe once a year, review and adjust your draw if the business has improved or worsened.  Include your wife in these reviews.

3. Have a discussion about life goals and financial goals with your wife - where to live, when to retire, what to spend money on.  Supporting family? Traveling the world? Going back to school? Buying a vacation home?  Retiring young?  Figure out the cost of these goals and how long it would take to save to achieve them.  When she sees how achievable the goals are, and how long it will take, maybe she will feel more confident about your financial situation.

Your wife cannot obsess for unlimited amounts of time about money and work.  That is not healthy for either of you.  But you cannot lock her out, because that just makes her push harder.  Set specific times to talk, set reasonably specific goals so she can see how much progress you two are making, and pay yourself a regular draw so she doesn't get fiscal seasickness from the volatility.

In addition, I should comment that you might consider investing more of your time in financial planning.  For example, overpaying your mortgage might not be to your advantage, since you are likely paying AMT and a limited mortgage interest deduction is one of the few deductions available to you under the AMT.  If you put effort into learning and understanding your personal finances, you can be in a better position to explain to your wife, in full honesty, how well managed they are."
She's self-centered because she is holding out hope? Ok.
"Tell him that every time he mentions your weight, you're going to go eat a full cake. If you're at a meal and he says something, start shoving food in your mouth the second he mentions it.

Perhaps he'll stop if it has the reverse impact of what he wants it to."
"&gt;I don't the relevance of your gf or her friends financial situations.

Right??? Also, lol to the ""rich people do brunch"" bit... dude, my boyfriend and I are by no means rich and we do brunch all the time... it's an excuse to be lazy on the weekend and not deal with cooking breakfast until a bit later. Also: mimosas. "
"&gt; I feel like this is partly or maybe mainly my fault that it got like this. 

Remember this in the future, if you're tempted again to meddle in other people's business. You never know what kind of damage you cause. Imagine how you'd feel if he'd killed her. 

&gt; I had no idea that Daniel was a violent person in this way - I had never, ever seen that side of him

Men who beat women don't tend to brag about it to their buddies. Your friend has a hidden life built on violence and secrecy. There's no reason to think you would have known."
"Thank you for your response. 
I will first try to stop thinking of it as an STD (as a lot of people are telling me lol. My bad.) and second.. Does this mean that I should have a bigger conversation with him about why he thinks his roommate gave it to him?
I'm not sure if this means I should be less concerned with the herpes and more concerned with how he got it. 

Not jumping to conclusions, just curious."
"She may just want you to be emotionally supportive and thinks that abstaining from the activities she can no longer participate in you'll be able to be there for her on a deeper level.  It may be inconvenient, but it's not like it's forever.  Maybe consider complying to one or two of her requests just to make her feel better.  If the requests aren't coming from a rational point on her end, then refusing may just cause much more drama that is worse than just putting up with inconveniences for 8 months "
"Jesus, how do people get this hamster wheel mentality from? If I could earn even half of what this guy is earning on 30 hours a week, I'd sure as hell be doing it. Why should he work more hours? They're earning nearly $200,000 between the two of them! There's no actual reason why he needs to work more hours, and it's probably best for his mental and physical health that he has this mid-week break to deal with personal matters like errands and cooking nice meals.

The guy is living an awesome life, earns lots of money at a young age (okay, if he's in Silicon Valley 130,000 might not be bank, but in the midwest he'd never have a want at that wage), and deals with odds and ends around the house on his off day. 

I don't see a single reason why he should work more hours. His wife doesn't even want to work less hours! She just seems to want him to work more (which wouldn't even necessarily lead to more income)"
"I guess if you look at it that way, you're right. I think of it a little differently, but it didn't take 4 dates! I broke it off after our second. I would never continue with my arrangement after our second date, where we did kiss and made a third date right at the end of it. I knew things were going to go somewhere, so I broke it off right after."
The only Real Abuse is Other People's Abuse. It's one of the few core beliefs that is universal among abusers. 
"Unless he is in the top 10% of his class at a top notch law school, he is not guaranteed to earn bank. My husband is a self-employed attorney and a very good one, at that. Attorneys pay him to write important briefs for them, including briefs to the Supreme Court. Even so, he has good years and bad years but he has never ""made bank"". "
"Your relationship has been burnt to the ground and you're still trying to rebuild it out of the ashes. Sorry dude, I don't think that's going to happen.

So, my boyfriend and I used to be poly. I had a second boyfriend, he had a second girlfriend. His second girlfriend (whom I didn't like very much because she was manipulative and unstable) realised her relationship with our mutual boyfriend was on the rocks, so she booked an overseas holiday with them both (to a location he and I had planned to go to) and essentially ""forced"" him to go with her. 

It's a long, complicated and utterly stupid story, but the only reason I didn't break up with my boyfriend over that trip (and trust me, I was very close to doing so) was because we had been together for two years at that point, trusted eachother, and he was taking every effort available to make me feel better about the situation whilst he was over there (reaching out to me as often as he could).

Had this happened one month into our relationship, there is no way we'd still be together. There's only so much strain you can put on a relationship that new.

&gt; There were actually way more selfies of the two of us than I can actually remember. She posted such a majority of those pics that it actually looked like we were a couple. 

You're talking about this like it was an accident. Trust me, this was exactly Ashley's intention. She wanted to torpedo your relationship from afar, and she succeeded.

You can claim ignorance, you can say this wasn't your fault, that you couldn't predict this would happen, you can say whatever you want. But I don't think your budding relationship from Chloe could recover from this. If you really really didn't want to lose her, you shouldn't have not gone on this trip with an ex-FWB. Even though you didn't cheat on her, even though you didn't know it would end up *this* bad, you should have realised that going on a week-long overseas trip with an ex-FWB (who seems to still want to claim ownership of you) to an exotic location sends a pretty clear message that you don't have room in your life for a new relationship.

Better luck next time.

"How did that conversation go?  It wasn't a one-sided hour-long monologue was it?   

From your posts so far it doesn't sound like it but hey you never know.  If it's something you're passionate about you could be rambling on to an uncaring audience which will get you ditched no matter the topic.

If you mention it and the response you get is lukewarm, drop the topic and move on.  If you do that and they disappeared anyway, so you are at your most charming and didn't do anything wrong, well yeah maybe they just weren't into the martial arts but that's bad luck.  Plenty of women will be.  If you have this problem five or six times in a row that's not likely a coincidence but this could be.

Edit: final thought, also even if you are stating basic facts, if you are bringing up those three black belts in the initial conversation that is probably too much.  You start with ""my main hobby is martial arts, I do a variety but have just started Jiu Jutsu"", and if she doesn't ask questions you leave it at that more or less.  If it comes up naturally sure talk about it.  But I can see this being a particularly fraught topic where you need to be more aware of impressions than some other hobbies."
"You should probably spend half an hour learning about Islam before you go round for tea.  If you search 'Islam basics' the top two results are both really good primers but the BBC one is a bit more accessibly written. Apart from that, just be polite (and probably don't wear anything too revealing) and respectful - it sounds like this could be a two-way learning experience.

I wouldn't overthink it, honestly, this is a great opportunity to do some cultural exchange and make friends.  "
"It's actually not that uncommon. My dad's boss was an electrical engineer and couldn't install a simple geyser. People can be weird, it's not a big deal. "
"&gt; First off, maybe this is the slightly-old-man inside of me, but drugs and drinking ARE bad, mkay

Does understanding that reference make me old too?"
"How do you know for a fact that what he said about his wife is true? This a 40 year old man preying on a young woman, cheating with her on his wife and leaving her behind with their two children. Don't be so quick to believe his words"
"In addition to Narcissism, it might be helpful for you and your wife to look into ""borderline personality disorder"". It's extremely similar to narcissism but as the child of a parent with untreated BPD, it's strikingly similar to my parent's (BPD mom and enabler dad) behavior. "
So he had an affair in response?
"Actually, you might want to get some sort of liability policy because of the way he behaves. With the random screws, it's not just tires - it's feet - and it just looks trashy, honestly. Point out that you like having *nice* things, but if he just leaves his tools out to get rusty in the rain, he's gotta buy replacements.

Seems like he likes the idea of rugged masculinity or something - so it might be a good idea to tie this to *competence*. Like, ""Okay, rah rah, you're doing your big manly thing by building a deck or burning the trash or whatever. That's great - but could you try to emulate Ron Swanson a bit more? By that I mean, not just be some guy who half-asses a project and leaves trash strewn in his wake as he drives down the road, and has rusty screws studding his yard. But be a guy who's *competent* and actually does stuff in a skillful way. This isn't hard, but it requires some concentration. Put away your tools. Watch your fires. Pick up your trash. Don't trush air bubbles to keep things in the bed of your truck - which we both know doesn't actually work. In short, be a grown-ass adult who deals with the consequences of his actions, rather than leaving them for other people to deal with."""
He's planning to leave you. Time to look up a lawyer
"If you were him, wanted to have sex with your girlfriend, and wanted to communicate to her that you weren't prepared to wait a long time into the future for that part of a relationship, how would you do it? How would you be more respectful, more considerate, and more mature about it without playing games? That is the hard question to answer.

It isn't perfect, but it is a hell of a lot better than most of us do at 17. Context matters."
"Something doesn't feel right about this, so I understand your doubts.  The main issue being that she isn't respecting you or your feelings at all.  Just thinking about doing this to my SO makes me feel dirty.  If she REALLY cared about your feelings, she'd request that you be able to go.  These guys, if they are reasonable at all, would understand that she should want her bf on a trip like this.  If they say no then something's up.  And if they would be fine with it and she's the one preventing you from going, then something even worse is up.

If you feel strongly about it (which it seems you do), I'd go ahead and tell her you are not comfortable with it and that if she follows through then you cannot continue the relationship.  This may seem extreme but she's not respecting you and even if she does love you, her needs are very different from yours.  "
No im saying your girlfriend wants to travel more. She's not asking you to pay her half from your edit. So she's got her budget taken care of. Your concern is spending more money. If you have a conversation about what each other needs are you can do LAN your budget accordingly. 
"From her description she's hung up on who he pretended to be. The kind and caring partner was an act the whole time. He was planning on dumping her for someone younger the whole time. 

This guy was always rotten at his core, he just hid it really well up until he broke up with her. "
If she's being completely honest about not sending them to anyone then she may believe you were the one who leaked the photos since you were the only one who had access to them.
"Maybe it's not so much the price, but the style she is disappointed with.  I really don't think buying an engagement ring should be unilateral because she is the one that has to wear it forever.  "
"I agree re: therapy, which is why I didn't recommend therapy. 

Your point is valid in the same sense that advising someone to stop being OCD is valid. If just not being ""insanely jealous"" was an option, OP wouldn't be here. He should just tell her. When in doubt, communicate. Knowing ""a bit"" about his family isn't enough for someone who had a great family to intuit OPs feelings here."
"Seriously for a guy concerned about getting bang for your buck it doesn't look like you really did any proper research AT ALL! You realise some (none chain) jewellers will have second hand stock (and will self select for quality pieces as opposed to whatever comes their way). You can buy diamonds at cost price, and get a nice setting made for relatively little. 

My husband is also super frugal (he grew up incredibly poor) and when I mentioned the type of ring I liked he rolled up his sleeves, found a decent jeweller and a gorgeous diamond that could deliver what I wanted at a FRACTION of the price. It took him a year. It speaks volumes that I was more impressed in some ways by the price tag he got it at then the ring itself. And it's freaking gorgeous. 

My ring cost 2 grand and looks like it cost WAY more then that. 

Edit: I just read below and you didn't get her a diamond or stone even though you were aware she might have wanted one. Not even a lab diamond which are pretty damn awesome :( And as far as I can tell the only real reason you're upset is because she's not as proud about your budget band as you'd like her to be? It's like you're a cat that brought a dead bloodied pidgeon into my bed and wants to be praised for the effort. 

You sound like you're trying to make it right though. That's a good sign - all the best."
"Wow. 

The title of your post is your concern for the love of your wife. But your post is *ALL* about how much you care for this other woman and how sad you are that she didn't leave her family so you two can magically elope and live happily forever. 

Kind of pathetic of you. 

You should not be discussing your feelings for other woman, without talking about them with your wife first.

You two are a team and she is there to help guide you in times like this. Crushes happen sometimes. Pretty people are everywhere. 

Get your shit together man. 

Do your wife a favor, either talk to her about this or leave her because you think you can do better. "
"I have a 3 year old.  Running away is normal.  You can try to tell them ahead of time to stay with you but it's a toss-up, especially so early on.  You did the right thing taking him home.  If he runs away in the park, he goes home.  If he runs away in the grocery store, he goes in the cart (ignore the other customers as you gently but firmly wrestle the writhing, screaming child into the seat).  If you take him out in the yard and he runs away, back in the house.  He'll learn that he needs to stay with you or the fun will stop.  

He's probably in shell-shock now with the change and is trying to figure out what he can get away with.  It will improve.  "
I had my spinal surgery in 2010 too! Mine was done with keyhole style so I say I got caught in a bear trap.
"Your boyfriend is really the one with decisions to make here, I think. It's going to be hell if he wants to think about marrying you, knowing you're from such racist stock. But, how you decide to handle this may sway that decision. 

Provoking a fight in my house is one of the things I remove people from my life over. I have a list of relatives who are never allowed to set foot in my home because all they do is start shit just to sit back and watch other people react. It's *my* home, *my* space, and *I* say who is welcome and safe here. My own racist relatives? Unwelcome in my house and completely unaware of where I even live. But I have a family I've chosen of all kinds of people-- straight, gay, kinky, vanilla, all different races and religions and ethnicities-- and they all realize I've got an open door and a couch to crash on if they ever want or need it. Most of my blood relatives don't even know what state I live in.

Your brother walked into your boyfriend's space and (verbally) attacked him. Keep in mind too that your boyfriend probably gets shit for dating a white girl from other sources you may not even know about. There are even divides within the Black community based on where someone is from according to my Caribbean friends. 

If he decides to stay with you in spite of this horrific behavior from your brother, I think it should go without saying that your brother becomes a very small-- if not entirely non-existent-- part of your life. It wouldn't be fair to force your boyfriend to socialize with violent racists because he cares for you. "
"Congratulations on your part. I hope you ""break a leg"" and have a great time with the performance.

You bf is a jerk. Sorry but being a partner includes an element of support your partner. He is not able to do that and in my book you need to think about whether he actually has any relationship with you or is it all one sided. 

My advice is don't force this issue or argue about it. Just end it. "
"He actually really likes Fullerton after visiting the campus and is really excited to attend in the fall, so I won't be encouraging him to do the transfer process just to appease my mom's ego.

Thanks for sharing your experience! Hopefully my mom will mellow out about ""status"" after he graduates as well."
"At this stage it's really Chris who's in the hot seat.  Because of his personal relationship with OP's GF, any sort of discipline (or lack of) he enforces with OP would come under stricter observation because of the conflict of interest.

I've no clue what advice I'd give OP really.  He's already dating a co-worker.  That co-worker had a pre-existing personal relationship with his manager.  

That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if Chris is already aware of this conflict of interest and has another manager he refers issues with OP to - it's about the only way you can ethically handle these convoluted conflicts in a quiet way. "
"Clearly you don't understand how DV works either. When a person is a victim in a situation like this, you don't take away their choice by getting the authorities involved. She's already had her control/choice taken away by her abuser - she needs to be in control of what happens next. Do some goddamn research about this - there's a boatload of information on the internet. "
Lol that's what you're mind jumps to? That she's probably faking? 
"I agree, I just think she will get farther by asking her dad to say something.  It's his job to stand up for her, not to sneak around to appease his girlfriend."
"... Really? He was a 24-year-old who thought it was appropriate to date a girl who was barely old enough to have a driver's license for a *year*. And he doesn't seem to think that's strange. That's not just an age difference. That's an adult dating a child, which is *gross*."
"&gt; What a strange recommendation from your therapist

This is actually a very common recommendation, lots of shrinks &amp; doctors are big on accountability. One of my friend's doctors gave him a 10k daily step goal and his wife holds him accountable, she checked daily in the beginning but now takes his word for it. It's caused a huge health turnaround for him."
"Oh my God, every comment I read from you is more and more terrifying. The only reason you aren't running away screaming already is because you have been with him since you were 18 and probably think this (and other stuff you haven't even mentioned here yet) is totally normal because you have nothing to compare it to. 

This is all really bad. This is not how healthy relationships work. This is exactly how relationships work when an older man seeks out a teenager to control her and feel superior to her. I'm not saying he is a villain twirling his mustache seeking to abuse young girls--he was/is probably unaware of why he needs to have control and dictate things and has all these justifications for his behavior. And of course he has probably done and said sweet and wonderful things because no one is 100% evil all the time and even the worst abusers are wonderfully loving much of the time, or else they'd never find a partner to stay with them. 

But this is objectively a bad and unhealthy relationship. If you were my sister, cousin, or friend, I'd be worried sick and doing everything I could to help you leave, and help you realize that you *should* leave. "
"Oh, sooooo boring, so dull and impotent. "
Gonna have to invite her. I really have no choice. It is a terrible feeling having somebody in your life who is so negative. Not a long time ago she sent me a picture of our mutual friend's baby with the comment that the baby is ugly. That was the day i realized I want nothing to do with her.

"&gt;My dad had a really rough childhood, and a lot of the manipulative and inappropriate behavior he witnessed as a kid has sort of stuck with him.

So your father is manipulative.

&gt;Then he made a point to guilt trip us since we all either had work or didn't want to go (I'm finishing college, my younger brother is starting college and my sister is going into her senior year in high school). Then he told us that his girlfriend said that ""it'd be nice if your kids would take off work and do something with you once and a while"", which pissed me off because I don't even know this woman and she's already making assumptions about me and the relation I have with my dad.

So your father claims his new girlfriend said something that makes you feel bad, in an attempt to make you do what your father wants.  Do you actually know that his new girlfriend said this, or could this be your father manipulating you?

&gt;She isn't dating anyone and I know it really bothers her that her abusive ex husband is out having fun and that her kids are out having fun with her abusive ex.

So your father was abusive to your mother.

&gt;Anyways, I just hate how he treated us all like shit our entire lives and then acts surprised when we don't want to be involved in his life. I also feel like I've got my own life to worry about right now and I just don't want to deal with it anymore.

Fair enough.

&gt;TL;DR - I don't want anything to do with my dad's girlfriend

I really don't understand where your dad's new girlfriend enters the picture here.  It seems you don't want anything to do with your father, and you have every right to completely cut him off if you want to.  It seems like the whole 'I hate his girlfriend' is just an excuse, though."
"Another idea is to try to get a job.  To do that, your mom will have to give you your documents.  You can get them to make a copy at work and hide them.  At work, you can meet all kinds of people.

You could also talk to your minister, if you think you can trust him.  Tell him you need a friend, and ask for his help."

"I don't think her request is weird at all. That being said, your comment history makes it clear you aren't over him, and this post sounds bitter. I'm not judging you - it must be stressful to see someone you love happy with someone else.

So block him and his wife, stop trying to be friends with him, and move on. It's the best choice for everyone involved."
Selfish teens don't care what their parents think. What makes you think she would care about our opinions? 
"&gt;Maybe you should let the FBI, CIA and NSA know this. Those agencies use them regularly as investigative tools.

But they do not use them as reliable indicators as to whether the person was telling the truth. ""Investigative tools"" is accurate, but that's because even if the test doesn't work at all, having a test that monitors stress and that people believe can be reliable or important is still useful to getting you information. The placebo effect can be a useful tool. 

Polygraphs are basically just ways of measuring people's responses under questioning. Scientifically, there's no basis for saying these responses will correspond just to lying, rather than nervousness. People can reliably beat polygraph tests by just controlling those particular reactions. Most of the test is subjective based on the perception of the examiner, and so isn't better than a non-polygraph trained examiner simply trying to guess based on your face and voice if you are lying.

And even with that said, it's also true the FBI among others has been criticized for using and even firing people for failing them, while also as an organization admitting they don't work for determining truth and that they should not be used as evidence of truth. Courts to not allow polygraph results as evidence of truth or falsity for that reason."
To start this commenter didn't even read the post thoroughly. That's usually a good thing to do before giving criticism here. 
"Been there, done that, and I was also in a lesbian relationship. I was fat, or at least felt fat, had a low self esteem, and kept looking for reassurance even though I didn't believe any of it. Fucked up, truly, living in a body that you hate. I asked my then girlfriend how attractive she though I objectively was out of ten - the dumbest question you can ask, haha - and she answered I was a 4.5. That stung, shit! I'd been looking to lose weight for years back then and nothing had helped. Being told I was ugly didn't help, either. 


You know what did help? Learning the science and mechanics of how to lose weight. It can often feel daunting and frustrating when you're fat and you don't understand why it is so, and why your trying to lose weight doesn't work. All you have left is trying to cope with your self-hatred. Few people are capable of finding self-worth within their selves, we usually look into others as of into mirrors and view our value as if reflected in their opinions. Your girlfriend probably hates her body but tries to find some value for it in your acceptance. My girlfriend back then accepted me and actually seemed to like my body herself, but asked about an objective opinion, she painfully complied and let me know that I wasn't conventionally attractive. And, well, I AM quite conventionally attractive if you look at the things I can't change - I have a pretty face, eyes, alright hair, a curvy figure (as in - nice waist hip ratio, pretty breasts). It was just weight and fitness holding me back. She subversely acknowledged it. 


What is my advice to you? I have no idea whether you should let her know you find her less attractive just now, that depends on how many more pounds she'd have to gain for her looks to become a dealbreaker. I think you should have her back, though. Being a healthy weight is good not only for your physical health, but also your mental health - one could argue if it is because when thin you fit in better and not have to feel bad about your looks, or if it is because of your body, your brain included, performing at its top potential. Why not push her towards becoming healthier? Before you inadvertently hurt her by acknowledging that you find her less attractive, I think it is worth it to try to get her to understand how simple the mechanics between weight loss and achieving the basic level of fitness are. If you want to discuss it further, feel free to pm me, as I've been through that. I can answer your question or redirect you to some resources. Good luck! "

"If OP is being accurate with timelines, getting pregnant was 4 years and nine months, cheating was 4 years. Not sure how you'd want to have sex right after giving birth, but for all we know, it could have also been an emotional affair.

"You're getting a lot of suggestions for ""no it's not"", but if you're really uncomfortable saying that, you don't have to. Just keep responding as though your version of reality is what's going to happen. If she never gets a reply from you in the bathroom, she'll wise up.

You: lOh, I'll be out soon and find you""
Her: ""Don't worry, it's ok, what do you think about xyz""
You: ""Don't worry about it, I'll find you!""
Her: ""It's ok, well just do it here""
You: ""It's fine, I'll be right out.""
Etc. 

Whatever you do, don't make any constructive comment while you're in there. You want it to be a waste of time to talk to you.

Then, just get the house and have your bother over a lot. Have all the kids over a lot, and and just let the older ones stay over night occasionally at first, tell your mom you miss hanging out with them. Let her know there's no drugs or staying up late and that home work will be done but you all want to watch a movie after etc. And then just let it happen more and more.

Not a perfect plan, but it might at least offer a respite for your siblings when home is too much. "

"They are definitely not close, they are across the country. I know there is a lot of resentment towards her mom about the foster kids. Like, it's a very noble thing for her mom to do, to raise hundreds of foster kids throughout her life. My gf is her mom's only biological daughter and she has one biological brother. But my gf has had to come along for the ride sharing everything she's had in her life with foster kids who are transient in her life. Most of her biological family wants her mom to stop doing foster care to focus on her family and her dad is in his mid 60's and probably doesn't need little kids running around the house every day for the last 30 years. But he supports his wife in continuing because she feels that is her calling in life and would have no purpose without foster care. My girlfriend wants her mom to be able to spend more quality time with her and she feels like her mom chooses foster care over her for her whole life."
"You don't owe him the opportunity to make amends. It is hard to see how he has been impacted by this - though you'd think he'd be debilitated with guilt - and he doesn't deserve to get off so easily when you are in hell. You worry about yourself. Having a relationship with him because you 'share a common bond' wouldn't benefit you, so don't do it. Either ignore her and him entirely or tell her you will never have a relationship and don't appreciate her contacting you, and that she and he should never try to ever again. 

I am so, so sorry. I cannot imagine what you have gone through. You may always be angry and if so, that would be very understandable."

"Your dream guy is someone who physically abused his wife? You should dream bigger. This seems like the definition of too much baggage: long distance, not fully divorced, abusive. Also keep in mind that it is extremely easy for someone to present a very edited version of who they are in a long distance relationship. You don't know him, as much as it might feel like you do. I say this as someone who was in a two-year long-distance relationship that lead to a long-term, in-person relationship and a happy marriage. You don't know someone until you interact in-person. And this guy has so many red flags, it's not worth investing time in. "
"A friend of mine who was caught up in a similar situation gathered up all the things he'd left at her place, including a few pairs of boxer shorts, and put them into an open topped cardboard box. With a friend acting as getaway driver they drove to his house (kept engine running) and rang the doorbell. When the wife answered my friend asked for the husband, and on the husband appearing thrust the box into his arms with the words, ""I'm returning these. It's over.""Last thing she heard was wife turning to husband and saying, ""Who is this woman and what's she doing with your underwear?""

Apparently it was enornously good for self-esteem."
"Differences in sex drive can be discussed and compromised on (within reason) in mature, loving, understanding ways. That's not what your bf is doing. He's using guilt and fear of conflict to just force you to have sex you don't want. His behaviour is absolutely not okay. Honestly it's abusive. I'm not surprised you want even less sex as a result - feeling pressured, tense, and constantly on eggshells about sex is not going to turn anybody on."

"OP knows very well the trauma his sister suffered, because he saw it first hand. He knows she didn't have a fun life; he even describes that in his post. The point of his post was about his own pain, which he is allowed to have and should be allowed to process without this kind of attempted guilt trip. He doesn't need to hear yet another person invalidate him and tell him to think of his poor, suffering sister. He's heard that all his life. There's always someone suffering more, in any situation where we find ourselves. That doesn't negate our suffering. "
"He's in college, with that tuition it would make no sense for OP to be financially independent until he graduates, which sounds like the plan.

Doesn't sound like the right strategy in his case, especially since it seems like his mother is Bank rolling the operation."

"&gt;What kind of fucked up person starts questioning a relationship over something as mild as eczema?

Honestly? Depends on what his definition of ""medium-high"" severity is. That's about what I'd describe mine as and I used to be so bad I oozed, people always asked me if I was contagious, and I'd have nights I couldn't sleep because everything was so gorram itchy and I just wanted to claw my skin off. I've learned to manage it since then, but depending on how severe/controlled his is? I can totally see somebody thinking ""I don't want to do that to my (grand)kids"" or even just thinking ""her health is bad enough, she needs somebody with a good immune system to balance her out"""
"I can't speak for all Autistic people, or all disabled people, but I will say this as an Autistic person who also knows a lot of other disabled people who feel the same way. Please, do not take someone under your wing and be friends with him just because he's Autistic and doesn't have any other friends. Autistic people need to learn that not everyone is going to like them, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for stupid reasons. Part of growing up as an Autistic person is learning to adjust to that reality in your own way, and it's confusing and hurtful when people are ""friends"" with you in spite of not liking you.

Now, if you all genuinely like the guy and enjoy his friendship, then it's perfectly fine for you to be friends with him and accept his difficulties. If you like him, that'll make it much easier for you to be patient with him when he makes mistakes, and go out of your way to tell him to fix them.

Now, I do agree with others who say that this is more of an entitlement issue, though I do think it's exacerbated by his Autism. Tell him directly that you're not comfortable with him verbally attacking people who have girlfriends, and explain all the reasons: it's hurtful, it treats girls like trophies to be won, it makes people worry that he may try to hurt them, etc....and explain to him that you would rather not hang out with someone who behaves this way. Encourage him to talk to a therapist about this issue rather than his friends.

And I agree with the others--don't use the ""you'll get a girlfriend someday"" argument. For an Autistic person, there is never any guarantee that that will happen, and we KNOW it when you say this to us, and it comes across as dismissive. I know you're trying to be helpful, but to an Autistic person, it may register as ""they're lying just to shut me up"" or something along those lines. It's often better to be honest, even if you think what you're saying may be hurtful."

She's being very level headed and careful about planning for the future. She loves you and wants to discuss these questions to make sure the children you have will have their lives well looked after. Some of these topics may be difficult to discuss but it's good to think about them before you may encounter them.

Youre manipulating him. You almost sound like a predator. Stop that. Encourage him to move. Find a new room mate.
"Okay, thanks. Maybe that will work."
Have you ever actually talked about this specific issue with him?
"I agree that's definitely the right approach, but in what way is that not an ultimatum?"
"&gt;Not really. Nothing out of the ordinary.

So... why aren't you staying home and doing the daily errands/chores/cooking that you could get done because you have the vacation time?

Again: Why should your wife get saddled with all the chores and errands for 2 weeks so you can take international vacations with your friends? Do you think it's fair that she has to do all the cleaning, cooking, errands, etc, on top of work during that time because you don't feel like staying home?"
"Oh god, *thank you*. There are like 10 upvoted comments in this thread giving this """"advice"""". The only time something like that would yield positive results is if the guy desperately *does* want to get married, but either has some sort of specific anxiety around proposals, or isn't sure if the girlfriend is on board. Neither is true in this case.

If OP proposes to her boyfriend, best case scenario is he'll begrudgingly say yes, they'll both stew in resentment, and the relationship will fall apart a year later. Worst case scenario he says ""no"" and the relationship is over."

Before you make a decision you should really bring this up with your therapist (if you're still in therapy).  This is a lot, a whole lot and you need to make sure you are making the right decision.

For example, riding a motorcycle is a high risk activity and she may be thinking along the lines of, you know, not wanting her kid to have a dead father. Likewise she may want you to regulate your sleep habits so you're in a better position to help out with night feedings etc.

Stuff like alcohol seems less relevant, unless you drink to excess.
