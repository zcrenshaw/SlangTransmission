"&gt;As devastating as it may be, OP can no longer lean on her sister for emotional support or advice. She can no longer share her innermost self with sister because sister has violated that trust egregiously.

That's the big thing, I'd say. While it's possible that OP can recover some bit of her relationship with her sister, if her sister realizes that she's been fucking up and wants to change. But even then, that trust has been very damaged. At the very least, OP should distance herself from her sister simply because she cannot trust that anything she says to her sister won't get back to her ex."

"If this was all an innocent misunderstanding, why did the two of them act so shady? Why did she rush him out rather than introduce her friend and her boyfriend to each other? Why hadn't she mentioned to you earlier that a friend was visiting from out of town? Why did she take an hour and ten minutes to call you back and then suddenly have a somewhat more credible answer about movie times?

She has decided to lie to you after cheating on you. Break up with her. "

"&gt;I can't help but wonder if there is some issue or event from your own past that is triggering you to such an extreme emotional response

I was thinking this as well. The fact that OP was so quick to label her son as a sexual predator, and jumped to cutting ties with anyone who said he wasn't is alarming, and can't be a normal or healthy response to this situation. "

"Just imagine she is addicted to heroin, not food. I doubt anyone would allow her to order it online or drive to her dealer. You should treat it like any other life threatening addiction and act accordingly. 

Ultimately, OP, just like with a drug addict, if she doesn't want to change there is nothing you can do. It is incredibly painful to watch a person you care about wreck their own life. But you shouldn't feel guilty, because whatever you do and as much you try, you cannot possibly fix her if she doesn't so want. You can only support her if she makes the decision herself. But you can certainly place some hard ultimatums as it sounds like that's one thing you haven't tried so far. 

"
gross. That's horrible and you were so wise to cut contact.
"For some people shaving/waxing/depilatory is a hard limit. I am one of those people. Will not do it. 

Reasons: I'm very prone to (painful, unsightly) ingrown hairs, I hate the look of a waxed (even with landing strip) woman and don't want to sport that look myself, and the hair provides me some protection down there which I prefer.

I DO trim it neatly. I keep it trimmed out of courtesy to my partner. After my first relationship, in which this exact disagreement was a dealbreaker for both of us, I made sure to only date men who are happy with my downstairs being trimmed. Like I would literally ask them early on while dating them how they felt about it. I understand it's not for everyone. Some guys of our generation require a waxed or shaved woman.

If you're just repeatedly telling her, especially in ways that are angry, accusatory, nagging, or whining, it's no wonder she's not interested in sex or making an effort to please you. That's exactly what happened for me.

If she's not doing it, it's because she's unwilling to. End of story. 

If that's a dealbreaker for you--which, again, was what I discovered with my ex--then it sounds like divorce is a valid path for you."
"There are many women out there you could be with but if you fail this class or do poorly you are compromising your future. 

Your girlfriend is showing you how she handles stress and competition. Imagine a lifetime of unreasonable demands. 

Do well on the tests and see if she is capable of acting like a decent, supportive human being or if she follows through on  her threat. It will tell you a lot about her."
"No, I called him everyday that he ignored me. Usually before that we would trade on and off. But, I think your right in that it was a communication issue. We both struggle with that. "
"I feel for your girlfriend. That situation would scare the shit out of me. You have to think of it from her perspective too-- you completely forgot about her. So here you are rushing ahead and being pursued by this guy and you're leaving her behind. She doesn't know WTF is going on. For all we know she could've quietly been trying to calm you down but you were zoned out and didn't hear a word she said. That would strike me hard. Plus there are hundreds of other people around and shes probably fighting her way past people just to try to keep up with you. Not to mention, shes seeing all the people that are turning and looking at the altercation..  I'd be embarrassed, scared, shocked, everything. On top of that you used a slur, which for all you know the person could've had a gun and shot you right then and there. 


So, your question, what do you do? Nothing. You can't do anything. You can't make her see that ""wasn't the real you"", you can't prove anything to her. Honestly, your obsession over it is probably freaking her out even more. 


Take a step back and breathe. You've learned something very important and next time will hopefully react more appropriately. 


But it is all over. It happened. You can't go back in time, you can't change things, you can't fix it. You need to move on. And when you start to act normal, she will start to feel more comfortable. "
"Yeah I am going to go the opposite direction on this one and say you are doing something that you are not letting on in this thread.    It is not normal for girls or even guys for that matter to have random men wanting to fight them especially sober. If it was a one time thing I would agree with the thread but if it happens a lot its probably you.   My guess from your past and the fact that you do Krav Magra that you are asking for a fight even if you are doing it subconciously.  You can do things to escalate or descalate a situation.  

I would also point to the physically imposing people getting into fights as a example.  Being physically imposing doesn't make people want to fight you,  if anything its the opposite because other people don't want to get beat up.  What is more likely is that physically imposing guys are more confidant that a fight will go in their favor and are more likely to escalate things to cause things to lead to a physical confrontation.  I am an ass and especially was one when I was younger and have never gotten in a fight I did not want to be in even though I pissed tons of people off like literal shit tons and I was not nice about. (also I haven't been in one since high school but that was because I wanted it) 

 I am guessing that the type of guys that you are getting into it with are also the type of guy to escalate a situation, of which you probably are also escalating leading to these events.  "
"The world isn't so black and white, in my opinion. There's a lot of context and shared moments that were completely real in all that time, true love. When something really hard like this happens I don't see why it should completely invalidate everything that has happened. Provided trust exists and is rebuilt. "
"Your friends live in their little bubble. They assume that their experience in life is the same as everybody else's. They are too immature to realize that people in different life circumstances are going to have different experiences. 

Worse, by you staying silent about this stuff, they will take that as agreement. They will run around saying, ""I said Black Lives Matter was a bunch of whiners and my black friend totally agrees with me! 

The fact is, no matter how ""suburban"" you feel, there are things that will happen to you on account of your skin color. There will be people who treat you differently and make all kinds of stupid assumptions about you because of it, and none of this will go down in front of other white people. 

Actually, the brave thing to do wouls be to call your friends out. Naturally you are reticent because you are afraid of losing your deiends, and for goos reason. Your friends will probably not like hearing that they are not hilarious and worldly. They may get mad at you, tell you to shut up, tell you to stop being a &lt;insert slur insulting your manhood&gt;. 

I know it's easy to tell you to make new friends when you are stuck with these guys, but ideally, if these guys cannot stop insulting you to your face, you need new friends. "
"Yeah... He got tested, but some STIs take awhile to appear in a test. Did he wait weeks to have sex with the OP to confirm he had no STI? I kinda doubt that."
"So, before you moved in together he promised you you'd be partners for the house stuff. He lied. I think that's quite the biggie here."
"dang dude, i feel that"
That's a pretty good explanation 
Yes it is worth it not to be a doormat and to not enable this behavior in a person who will continue unleashing that the type of bullshit to the rest of humanity for the rest of her life. The reason people act shitty is cause countless people let them and they learned they can get away with that behavior. Stop helping great shitty people in the world just cause you're afraid of the smallest of confrontations
"I think that's understandable. And you should take as much time as you need to decide. For me, the biggest problem here is why did he tell you now. Why you should you believe *this* story. You'e already believed his lies for the last 3 years, how can you be sure that this is everything and not just the start of some trickle truthing.

I don't have any answers for you really other than to ask as many questions as you need to, and take as long as you need to figure this out.

I cannot spot the pretentiousness.  Perhaps you are just not used to polite disagreement.

"She needs a job.

The first step toward independence is going to be employment. She's in a super abusive situation both emotionally and financially. I'm assuming your dad works. I would encourage her to try and get a part time job while he's away, and deposit her earnings into an account that he doesn't have access to (or knowledge of). That one little thing will probably help her to get to a place where she thinks she can make it without him. "
"Have you been totally honest with your girlfriend about what's going on? I mean I can't speak for every woman, but for me there would be a huge difference between a guy who mysteriously can't keep an erection, avoids sex and is vague about why, and a guy who's like ""look I'm attracted to you and want to have sex with you but x, y and z issues in my life are making it difficult for me to get back on that horse, I'm working on it in a, b and c specific ways."" Especially if he was also willing to go down on me, not going to lie."
"WTF?  

1.  Your grandma might have money now, that doesn't mean she'll have it when she dies.  Old people care is horribly expensive and whatever she had saved could be gone by the time she dies.

3.  You're in no way entitled to any of that money.

4.  Don't even ask."

"You say you compete at the highest collegiate level and you're 22, so I assume you don't have more than a single season of high level competition remaining.

"&gt; I told him to eat out himself if thats the case and I'll handle myself but he doesnt want to do it without me.

Here's how it is: If he wants to eat with you, he does the dishes. If he wants to eat out and not do dishes, he doesn't eat with you.

Honestly, make your own breakfast, lunch, and dinner and let him whine for a while. Maybe he needs the pain to get his head out of his butt."
"I think she has feelings for you and that's why she acts that way. 
- She is possessive and jealous because she likes you. She kinda marks her territory in her mind.
- She is ""disgusted by gays"", something many closeted gay people are/say they are, because they either internalized a hate for gay people and therefore themselves or don't want anyone to find out they are gay so they overcompensate.
- She sleeps with a lot of guys because she wants to convince herself she isn't gay, and cheats on her partners (which makes her an asshole) because she has no feelings for them anyway. 
- She stole your vibrator because she is into you and I don't have to explain why she wants it ... this is very violating, she involves you into her sex life without asking you and steals something so personal from you. That would be the last straw for me; honestly. 
So IMO, she is both gay and in love with you, and a bad person/friend. The best thing you can do for yourself and for her is to cut contact and explain to her exactly why. "
"So at first I thought, oh he's a slob. Then he became a jealous slob, then he became a jealous insecure slob. He's a grown man and needs to learn to take after himself, and if you can't tell him so in a frank conversation without him bursting into tears then he has much deeper issues. If you stay with him and don't fix it this will be lifelong. "
"Cheating is still cheating, even if it's someone of the same sex. This guy doesn't respect you or the relationship at all. Why are you still with him?"
No I laughed a lot and asked him how he expected me to walk right if he can't do it himself and he never brought it up again.
"How do you know that doesn't make your female roommates uncomfortable? Especially because your boyfriend doesn't technically live there, he just stays over....walking around in boxers just seems like a little bit much."
This is pretty standard for children of conservative Indians. Most younger people do not talk about dating at all. Parents dont want to hear about their childrens partners until they are ready to get engaged. 
"&gt;I will never abandon my son

You're making the right choice. It's going to be tough but you can get through it.

&gt;I'm scared to ask for help because I feel if I talk to friends/family

What about professional help? You'll obviously need a lawyer to deal with all of the issues about finances and the house. What about a counsellor so you have some emotional support? 

&gt;I still feel like I'm being mistreated here. I really don't know what to do about this. We've just bought a house, months of preparation, us sinking our savings into it and then just recently spending 4 or 5+ days solid, morning to night, packing, cleaning, loading, moving, unpacking, setting up - only to finally sit down and have this put on me on the first night.

You are being mistreated. She waited until you did all of this work and all of this effort to combine your lives because she's hoping you'll pick the ease of not having to do it so you'll stay. Just remember your son is worth the effort.

Also, has your son had any professional help? Not saying he's a 'demon' but having an unfit parent and now all this change sounds very difficult for him.

&gt;Do you think there's much hope?

I would be more optimistic for your chances to have a life as the four of you had she sat down and discussed ways to help your son be less difficult rather than 'we need to dump him'. It's always recommended to suggest couples counselling but I wouldn't bet on her agreeing to go since it's sounds like she's already made her choice.

&gt;I were invited to move into her house about 3 or 4 months into our relationship

Awful decision. Did you really think your son would be able to adapt smoothly moving into a new house with a woman and another kid he barely knows? Do not make this mistake again."
I'm just surprised that no one has mentioned that OP has been miserable at her job for the last 3 years and that hubby might not want to uproot after seeing how draining her career has been.
"This is what is getting me that people seem to not be recognising. The dog let go. She didn't want to maul the kid, she wanted to stop being tortured and OP wasn't doing anything to stop it so she reacted in the only way she could. 

If the dog wanted to inflict serious harm, she would have and OP would be in a much worse situation. "
"He wants her pregnant AND working a job doing hard labor?

He's not just abusive, he's totally clueless."
"His mom made things extremely awkward. He must be so close to her because unconditional love, but that would be a huge deal breaker for me. I wouldn't mind taking  a break from my mom after that. 

Eat that somewhat stolen chicken happily. "
Seriously?  You just mad because after four years with this guy you finally came to the realization that he's not gonna leave her for you. You invested all this time and have nothing to show for it. So now you're feeling burned and you wanna burn him too. Move on with your life and forget about him. 
You are totally fine if you're not interested in a woman who doesn't share the same sexual values as you. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise or make you feel guilty. 
"First of all, she wouldn't be setting him up to fail. The fact that he's failing is entirely because he sucks at planning. Second, she wouldn't be giving him shit for it. She would be expressing her disappointment that he didn't follow through on something that he said he would. Perfectly reasonable. If OP's bf goes into a depressive spiral because of that, then there are much bigger problems than his lack of planning"
"&gt; But in almost all of those scenarios I've seen with my own eyes it was the guy in the relationship being unwilling to be honest and forthright about what he wanted/when he wanted it/not wanting it at all that led to years of the women feeling like she had to ask repeatedly for clarity or some sign of eventually getting a commitment.

I totally agree. I hate that stereotype because I've never once seen it play out--it's always the guy who's being elusive and shady and avoiding saying outright that they don't want to marry them."
"He has some health issues as well as mild autism. Some days he shakes so badly he can't even hold a pen, we're still busy trying to find out what exactly it is and why it doesn't respond to medication. Parkinsons and brain tumors have been ruled out."
This is the best advice here.
Why on Earth would you discuss something so sensitive *over text*...*while he was at work*?
Tbh if this comment doesn't shock them into the seriousness of this situation idk what will
"Moving sucks. I give it at least a year before deciding if I like a new location. 

Have you tried getting involved with the community? Building ties helps invest you in the area. "
"Well I think that you shouldn't HAVE to explain your financial decisions to her. 

If you need other gift ideas, just say ""Hey girlfriend, I was actually looking to spend something more in the [$] price range. Is there a different concert you'd like to go to? Maybe I could buy tickets for that.

If she says ""but I spent so much on your birthday"" you can just say ""and I really appreciate the thought you put into the gift, but I just don't think it's a good financial decision for me to spend that much right now. I still want to give you something you'll enjoy, I just can't afford $300 concert tickets right now"".


But yknow, if she spends irresponsibly on you with the expectation that you'll then turn around and spend twice as much on her, she's not being a very good girlfriend. The point of gifts is not to give them so that you can expect something in return. If someone throws a fit over a gift you give them (or don't give them), they probably are too immature to be pulling their weight as a partner in other ways.

Also, I think a $350 birthday gift is insane especially at your age. Work on saving up and continue making good financial decisions.

"
"You didn't ""probably"" overstep boundaries, you definitely did, repeatedly, to the point where you seem obsessive and borderline stalker-ish towards this woman. If Amy were posting this from her perspective people would be telling her to document everything and to be prepared to seek a restraining order.

You need to learn to *listen* to people when they tell you things. When someone says ""I want space,"" that means they want space--it doesn't mean you get to say ""well okay BUT here's a wall of text about why you're horrible and me being sad is your fault."" You should show your therapist this thread in its entirety, including the texts, because if they knew the extent of your behavior, I doubt (or hope, anyway) they wouldn't have recommended writing a letter. "
"Absolutely yes! If she was getting anxiety about YOU in general she'd just cancel totally or keep making excuses not to see you. Just keep it chill and you guys will be fine. When it was me feeling a bit like things were moving too fast, as soon as I got into the swing of things, ironically it was ME that wanted things to get more serious."
I'm a woman with long hair and my least favorite part of long hair is pulling strands out of my butt/between my legs when I'm in the shower. I'm like how tf did that even get there. 
"Gay person here. I don't eat at Chick-Fil-A, partly because of the owner's funding of anti-LGBT stuff and partly because I don't care for the food. But I'm not mad at anyone who chooses to work there, certainly not someone such as yourself working an entry-level, minimum wage job there. It's no big deal to me. You're just there to make some money at a part-time job, not a political statement. (I would be somewhat annoyed by someone with more employment options who chose to pursue a full-time, long-term career there.) If you don't take the job, they'll just find someone else to do it. You quitting doesn't actually hurt them the way boycotting their food does.

IDK how your parents will take this but, if you think it might help, tell them an actual gay person on the internet doesn't care. I appreciate their concern.

"My dad is in his 50's moved to a new house 6 years ago.. His neighbor is his best friend they met the day he moved in, probably the best friend he has ever had.  It's never too late."
"I know what you're saying, but the thing is that most parents never abuse their children regardless of how they do academically. My parents never laid a finger on me growing up, and everybody I know (except for my SO) had similarly unabusive parents.

What your mother is doing is wrong. This is HER fault, not yours. You've done absolutely nothing to deserve the treatment you're getting. I can say that because there's no acceptable reason for a parent to beat a child, even a teenager.

It doesn't matter if you cuss, stay out late, drink, do bad in school, or whatever. There's zero valid excuse to beat your children. Good people use words, kindness and love to influence the change they want to see in this world. This is actually Jesus' message, something your religious parents would do well to realize.

I would reach out to your relatives - if they are the kind of people to take in an abused child, they may understand your situation. If they aren't sympathetic, you still need to call CPS. I know it sounds like a long time, but when your sister is old enough to move out, you'll be able to be close with her without living in fear of your parents.

This kind of thing isn't easy, but good things in life seldom are. This will be a long and difficult road, but in a few years you'll be able to live the way you want, without anyone telling you otherwise. It's something worth fighting for, my friend. To be free."
This reminds me of the time my mother found lipstick in my dad's car. Turns out one of **my** friends lost it under the seat and the situation took a while to diffuse because it's been a while since I've driven it and I had trouble finding *which* friend lost it.

"If her marriage fails because her legs got hairy, it wasn't very solid to begin with.

The words that actually came out of his mouth were intended to shame her into compliance, without even discussing her feelings and preference. You don't call someone ""sasquatch"" because you want to have a mature and respectful discussion as husband and wife.

"I mean, I know the world is a pretty safe place these days, but inviting a stranger into your home is just asking for trouble. "
"&gt; Except a lot of people like this aren't worried about upsetting their SO, because they love them and will always be there, and will forgive them, right? So they'll coddle a random dude selling kirby vacuums, but totally ignore the most important people in their life's feelings.

Damn, you articulated something I've never been able to put into words."
"I have to imagine that your boyfriend would be sharing a bed with the bridesmaid, unless they're only open to lodging arrangements that would offer a private room for the couple as well as hostel bunks for your boyfriend &amp; the bridesmaid, or unless the couple is also staying in dorm-style lodging. I can't imagine your boyfriend &amp; the bridesmaid would choose to pay more for separate bedrooms from one another. To be fair, most ""double bed"" rooms we encountered in Iceland were actually two twin beds pushed together that could easily be separated, but I still wouldn't be pleased with the arrangement as the girlfriend.

"Winter is the best time to see the Northern Lights and go glacier hiking! :)

I am currently trying to decide if it is. I really love him, but this eschews so many of my feelings and outright invalidates my emotions. I understand he's going through a lot, but this is hard on me, too (and I'm also going through a lot, as are we all.) "

He doesn't value you enough. I wonder if it's you or if he'd be like this in any relationship with anyone. 

I would seriously view this as a dealbreaker. You're so right in that you should be having adventures and traveling now, although also saving. "

Only do this if you can be curious and open to suggestion, not just snidely excited to rat Dave out. 

Other than that, make a project of behaving as professionally as possible around Dave, even if he doesn't deserve it. Ask for support when he isn't providing it. Be polite but immovable. Listen to his boring internet stories for a little bit and then cheerfully let him know that you need to get back to work. You probably won't end up liking him, but you can let go of feeling like you need to, which is its own kind of freedom. "
"Why would you say yes to such a bizarre request from your SIL? There was no need for a baby that's not eating solid food to try the sauce. How recently had your SIL washed her hands? 

This seems like poor judgment on your part. That said, your wife's response was abusive and unacceptable. You two may want to consider couples counseling because you're not communicating well or understanding each other. I saw you dismiss another person's suggestion that you wife may be under stress. You may not be the source of the stress, but she's probably feeling ""not good enough"" just the same. It's a pretty common societal refrain for women, especially working mothers."
"I think he sounds more frustrated. It sounds like your relationship has a big communication void. Hes not communicating with you about how he feels and you are not communicating with him about how you feel.

My best friend doesn't make me feel like crap.
"Some people don't want to wear safety equipment because its a reminder they could get hurt. Even though theyll get hurt a LOT less with it and are safer overall. Some people see a person with a face mask to block germs, and they freak out about that person getting them sick. Even though they're LESS likely to get sick than if the person's face were uncovered. 

So it may be a reminder that you almost had cancer and feels like you're sick. When you were uncut, even though you technically had a timebomb on your chest, you *looked healthy*. Now even though you're objectively safer, you *look ""sick""*.

It's not rational. 

If that's the case, he needs therapy. Reconstruction won't bring your breasts back you'll always look like someone who had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. If your flatness is a constant reminder of your mortality and the fragility of human life, your husband needs to get to a therapist and work on that. 

Wanting to play with your boobs or liking how you filled a dress or missing cleavage are all, honestly,  a bit healthier. He needs to be aware of what you'll actually have, bwcause they'll never be natural breasts. You shouldn't do it just for him without careful consideration.

"This more than anything else. Please be prepared to stand up for your sisters in the future if you really want to do this. Simply writing an apology letter and standing mute when they go through abuse again will not mean anything, both for them and for your daughter too. If you standby doing nothing, the message your daughter gets is that she will be treated the same and her father won't do anything about it."
"Basically your wife said 'weed makes me horny so I'd never put myself in a situation where I make myself horny with people who might take advantage of me' and then you freaked out. This screams overreaction to me. Is the something else going on in your relationship that this is a symptom of a greater problem? Like her wording is clumsy and it's a random thing to say, but like, she's high. 

I'm trying to think of an equivalent thing that my fiance could say that I'd be angry about... ""I don't get super wasted with women anymore because who knows what could happen!"" I guess I could see someone getting upset because you shouldn't go after other people, drunk or not... But that's the whole point, isn't it? That drugs and alcohol can make boundaries blurry, and responsible people don't put themselves into that situation.  "
"Right. I don't know about cheating but the ignorance and lack of empathy is concerning.

One of my friends had an easy pregnancy followed by a rough birth and she still can't have sex without debilitating pain 1-1.5yrs after birth (not sure if the problem is ongoing now, hence the range). Is he going to think she's just whining and all women do this so why is she having such issues? Etc. And you make a good point, what if she can't have more kids because of birth trauma? "
Not being into BDSM is not the same thing as being vanilla.
"That is a lot to handle, especially at 23. I'll be honest, she sounds like a huge dbag imo.

When it comes to her actually loving you or not, I believe that she did at one point. All those moments that you had were most likely real (it's pretty hard to fake that type of stuff imo). But just like anything, sometimes love fades and you realize you don't have the same feelings you have with a person as you did once before.

Telling your parents/family should not be an issue. Trust me, if they realized and hear the situation/how you feel about it, they'll get over it. You're their son, she is a girl that happened to come into the picture a few years ago. Don't worry about it.

You are not on some blacklist for dating, trust me. This isn't the same situation at all, but I got a DUI a few weeks ago. I thought my life was over, that no one would ever hire me, or even want to be friends with me for that matter. But like anything, people are understanding. Someone might at first be taken aback at it all, but when you explain it, no one is going to have a problem with it. You're young and you make mistakes. It's better than staying in the relationship and being miserable.
 And on the amount of time it'll take to get over it and fix the trust issues, it all depends. Might take a year, might take a few years. I would focus on myself for a while and keep doing think that I love to do. Pick up a new hobby, perfect a skill, whatever you have to do to help yourself grow and get your mind off it all. 
Talk to your friends about it when the time comes. They'll be a great support system for you in your time of need. I would move on from it all and break free from the relationship. If the feelings aren't there, they aren't there. Don't fret, there are literally billions of people out there, you'll be fine. And this was your first relationship, now you have learned a lot from it and can make better decisions in the future. 
"
"Ok, I'll give you my honest opinion. 

For you, yes, you have every right to be upset that she's having an abortion. You've been married for 15 years so every decision should be a group decision. That being said, it is her body and her choice. You can not force her to have your child. If she does choose to have an abortion, it's your choice if you want to stay or not. Personally, I think it's stupid that you're reacting to something that's not even born and if you're truly that infatuated with the prospect of having a third child, feel free to adopt a child from an orphanage. It'll help them out and help you out. I understand how people can have their personal beliefs but the bottom line is that it's her choice and not yours. "
"I dunno man, if for some reason I asked my girlfriend if I was the best she ever had when we were watching a movie and instead of just tossing out an affirmative she paused what we were watching to ponder all of the other sex she'd had in silence for a few moments I'd probably be kind of taken aback lol.

He's obviously fishing for an answer, just toss the poor guy a bone and move on, as long as this insecurity isn't something that bubbles up a ton in their relationship I don't see a problem with humoring him on this. This should be a no brainer, just don't even entertain the notion that someone from the past might have the edge on him on this one lol."
"What's the age of consent where they live?  

If it's 16, then he's all clear.  

If it's 18, then... this will blow your mind... but both he and his girlfriend _can be found guilty_ of distribution/possession of child porn. I know it doesn't make much sense, but that's just the way it is. Legally speaking, taking those photos and saving those photos were illegal _even back then_, when they were both kids.  

If you're asking from a moral perspective: Sounds perfectly normal. "
Then you're probably better off leaving him anyway
"They work just about the same amount of hours, so she really isn't working a lot. She works 36 hours a week and has 4 days off,  whereas he works 40 hours a week and has 2 days off.  She needs to quit being lazy and childish about taking the trash out. "
I'm amazed that many people think keeping animals locked in cages on a regular basis is okay.

Very good suggestion. Adoption: a) you may not know the medical history re mental illness and b) you may not be able to adopt with your medical condition.

"It's eerie because there's another thread going on right now about another woman who is a total pushover:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6sqy37/me_32_mwith_my_wife_28_f_she_cant_say_no_to/

But at least this woman only blew a couple thousand dollars on a stupid vacuum. Your life is in danger from a guy who literally threatened to harm you. 

&gt;Why is he even with me if he doesn't even love me and would get satisfaction out of physically hurting me? He says he loves me all the time but I honestly wouldn't threaten to kill someone I love no matter what.

The answer to your question is that some people are really fucking messed up. They have something deeply wrong and twisted in them that equates ""love"" with hurting their ""loved ones"". It's inexplicable to you and me and other sane people because why would someone want to hurt the people they love? But people can be really twisted and ugly inside. 

You may not be comfortable thinking about this, but please open your eyes and realize that your partner is a bad person."

"Eh, high school age siblings still sometimes get physical with each other. It really depends on what happened."
"Nice to see an actual empathetic comment. As I understood it, OP asked her bf for help going through things to get rid of, not cleaning. It's not like she's expecting him to clean her room for her. And while that may be too much to ask of someone given her anxiety, which he is not equipped to deal with, it's miles away from ""asking someone to do her chores for her"" like others are implying.

I thought it was fairly common knowledge that hoarding is a mental health issue, not a laziness/immaturity issue. Really surprised by the reception here. At the least people could've been kinder."
"I can guarantee that on 25,000 a year, no one is actually going out and enjoying that stuff. My family lived on slightly more than that growing up and my underwear literally had half a dozen holes and Arby's was my birthday dinner. It still costs money to do things like camp and hunt, shop at those decent amount of stores, and to commute to a job. Even if the household is clearing, say, 50 grand, that's still really easily eaten up by kids. "
"She also started immediately on the defensive, and then called him fat. We get one conversation in the OP, and in my opinion they both handled it poorly.  She put words in his mouth, he didn't defend himself and then said he didn't want to fight. 

What you are advising is for her to ignore the issue, and possibly let her marriage fail, instead of them both learning how to communicate as adults?  **I'm sorry but that's just bad advice..**"

Yes. Manipulation as well. 
When my grandfather retired not only was this the first time he got into conflict with his wife (because he was home all time without anything to do) he also got a stroke a few weeks later and then parkinsons. Some people need to work to survive or it just destroys them. That's why I want people to learn to have hobbies beside their work but that is another topic.
"You're moving into a different phase of your life. You may simply be outgrowing them. It happens.

Now they may grow up a bit too in the future, but right now they're acting like dicks. It's one thing when you flake out, but having other plans or real life responsibilities? Or avoiding people you hate? If your friends really cared about you, they would get this.

I would call them on their BS. Tell them that yes, you life and wants have changed. You accept them for who they are, they should be cool and accept you. If they don't support you, what kid of friends are they?

And harassing your partner? WTF? Are these guys really your friends anymore? They're not acting like it."
"Unless there's something I'm missing here, it really seemed like you two had some serious incompatibilities that were building over the course of this really long relationship. She wanted to be more independent. You talk about her having separate friends and hobbies - that doesn't sound crazy to me. Lots of couples have some friends in common, but not necessarily all. Some couples share some hobbies, but definitely not all. And the fact that you were planning to be childfree was going to allow you to spend time both with each other, but separately on your own passions; definitely more time than the average couple with children. That's usually the point of not having children; so you can devote yourselves to hobbies, career, travel, whatever it is that you want to devote yourself to. If you were truly on board with not having children, why would it bother you that she never, ever, under any circumstances wanted children? The fact that you would have been OK with having children indicates that you were fence sitting and that in and of itself is a dealbreaker - if you were truly on board with not having kids, it wouldn't caused resentment.

You say that while she was having an independent existence, trying to mesh as a couple wasn't working. Can you explain that a little more? Was she not willing to compromise? Did her friends seem like a bad influence? Did she not share what she was doing and with whom she was with? Did you guys ever go to couples counseling?

Again, I think you two had some fundamental incompatibilities that might have broken you up eventually, without counseling. I would advise you talk to someone yourself to get a little more perspective. I don't think you did anything wrong; it sounds like you need more from a partner than she was willing to give.  From what you write, I'm not sure she did anything wrong either. It sounds like you grew apart and need different things from your partners."
"&gt; tended to be more socially well-rounded since they weren't afraid to meet a person on shorter notice

My experience was that Tinder people tended to be flakier than OKC ones. I haven't been on as many Tinder dates (not least of all because more people flaked or weren't looking to meet up in the first place), but I didn't get the sense that they were more socially adept. And frankly, I consider the flakiness a social inhibition more than an asset."

"&gt; Allen doesn't think it makes sense to have the best man, maid of honor, and Harold make a speech

I've been to weddings where the maid of honor, best man, father of the bride, mother of the groom, groom AND bride have all made speeches (and each was between 5-10 min long). I'm honestly not a fan of too many speeches, but I don't think there's any reason to say no to Harold. An extra 3-5 minute speech won't kill anyone. Maybe he and your sister could do a speech together so they're not covering too much of the same ground. 

However, are you sure it's the fact that it could be overkill that's bothering your fiance? Or are there other reasons he's uncomfortable about your male best friend making a speech at your wedding? "
"You certainly don't have to stay in a relationship with him. But I don't think you don't owe him anything. If I'm reading your post correctly he was supposed to move to your city six months from now. Surely he would already have been planning this move? Letting his job know he wouldn't be open to another contract / return offer, not renewing his lease, selling items to move in with you. It is definitely on you for leading him on. He shouldn't have up and moved without discussing it, but I don't think moving 6 months early is a massive issue."
"He told you not to do something, you did it anyway, there haven't been any apparent consequences. What's the problem?"
"You don't even want to propose to her until things are better, but you buy a house, which is a far bigger commitment than an engagement?  Why would you do that?!  

I think you should either pursue counseling or split up.  This relationship isn't healthy and you both sound incredibly unhappy.  Under no circumstance should you make any further commitments.   If she won't go to counseling, you need to just end it.  If it wasn't for the house, I wouldn't even bother advising counseling.  But you've made a pretty big commitment here, so it's worth a shot.

I would also advise that you be *very* careful about what money you sink into the house.  Don't improve anything unless it's going to immediately increase the property value by at least the amount you put into it because if you have to sell, you are likely going to be losing money unless you live in a really hot market.    "
"This. It sounds like she carries the entire mental burden of the housework, and he can't switch mode from paying no attention to paying attention. I'm the same - it's either off or on, I'm thinking about my surroundings or I'm thinking about work and being tired. I have to make a conscious effort to turn on the awareness, or my fiancee has to start dealing with this stuff. She does do too much, but she is self employed and works from home and doesn't mind. As a scatter brained person anyway, it is literally a mental effort to think about the house and not just totally switch off to it. If he isn't making the effort, and endangering the dog, it might be a respect issue not an ADHD one."
You are 39 years old and you can't separate the smell of a fling's shampoo from your wife?  I feel sorry for your wife.
"&gt; She said things to him she rarely, if ever has said to me in three years of being madly in love. She told him how she felt towards him and how she loves when he kisses her and hugs her.

Dude, don't be naive. She knew exactly what she was doing. If she was really being blackmailed she should have come to you and told you what was going on so the two of you could work together on a plan. She didn't."

I almost feel like it might be a huge slap in the face. I get where you are coming from - but in that case maybe you should hire a nanny ? 
Resistance against my nonobvious flirting techniques is futile. We'll have a spring wedding.
"I feel what you're saying here and I mostly agree... but I definitely wouldn't suggest kicking her door in (or even continuing to pursue it if she keeps telling you to leave). Give her some space first, which also gives everyone time to really think about everything beforehand. "
Girl come on.   It's been 4 months.   What is this doing to your mental health?   A partner should be supportive and loving and respectful and make you HAPPY.  Does this guy make you happy?  Being single is better than being with this guy.  I bet when you break up with him you will feel a huge weight come off your shoulders.
She's 27 - she has 10+ years to find a new partner and have more kids. I think the odds are very good she'd be fine if it's something she really wants and actively looks for.
"&gt; Many people seem to be clinging onto the fact that I said she's attractive

Yeah, I've noticed that :/ It's great that she's attractive; hopefully that will help her find a good guy, after she's moved on from you. But it's totally okay to not be attracted *to* her. You can't force that shit."
What did your wife say when you brought it up to her?
"As a nerdy guy, sorry @_@

I think it's mostly a combination of most nerdy guys having very little experience with girls in their lives plus all the echo chamber stuff online in the last few years about feminists/redpillers.   Results in pretty unhealthy views toward women."
"Except that the only risk he's taking with that is ""I might lose her as a friend if this doesn't work out - and I'm pretty sure it won't,"" which is already happening.

But on her end, he'd be risking devastating her by sleeping with her, getting her hopes up, and then deciding it wasn't for him.

This girl is someone he cares about and respects deeply.  You don't play with peoples' emotions when there's that much at risk, just to ""experiment"" with your own feelings - especially when you care about them as much as OP does his best friend.

It's shortsighted to pretend that being besties and being SOs is the same, just with sex included.  There's a certain X-Factor that needs to be there as well - a romantic chemistry.  If you don't feel it, you don't feel it.  If u/sleptkingdom91 was suppressing those feelings for that long, do you really think they wouldn't have come to the surface after her confession?  Or while he lay awake all night thinking about it?"

"&gt;we were all just laughing and talking shit as usual.

My initial reaction was that it was an overreaction. I watched Dunkirk and wasn't moved by the movie so I wouldn't feel the need to be sombre but then I thought about it from another perspective. I know people who've been through wars and for them I don't think they'd take too kindly to people laughing after watching a portrayal of the aftermath of a war they were a part of. It gives off a just don't care vibe. I imagine someone laughing from something about (insert War) and I can definitely see some of the people I know not liking that one bit, depending of course on just what was said.

But it's hard to gauge when we don't know exactly what you guys were joking and laughing about.

&gt;she is pissed because we were all laughing after the movie. According to her we were super disrespectful to people who sacrificed there life during World War 2

Were you guys making fun of some of the people or actions in the movie and laughing about it?"
"Sure. Extremists are wrong. Extremists are delusion. But I'd argue that being willing to disregard something that fundamentally just means that men are equal to women solely because of extremists doesn't exactly reflect well on you. There are still a lot of ways that women are treated poorly in modern society (especially outside of, say, the US and other more developed nations) that creates a need for feminism. 

Look at it this way - some muslims are extremists, some muslims are terrorists. But saying the word ""muslim"" is ruined for you, refusing to learn about anything related to Islam, and even refusing to associate with any muslims would be kind of shitty, right?"
"Different people value things differently.  She doesn't think it's okay to laugh after 2 hours of watching people get blown up.  You do.  Neither approach is inherently wrong as no one is being harmed, but everyone has a preference and apparently you crossed a line for her.

If she believes in this strongly then it makes sense why she would react so harshly against it.  Your lack of ability to understand why she feels that way is not really a valid reason to dismiss it as an overreaction, because she clearly has different values to you.  I don't think it's that strange to feel somber after reflecting on the sacrifices made by people during wartime.  It's also really not that strange to be taken aback that other people aren't affected by it in the same way that you are.  If something offends your core values, then you react negatively toward it regardless of what others think about the sensibility of those values.

I'd personally just apologize and try to open her back up by talking about some of your more serious views regarding the horrors of war, as they are clearly very important to her, like they should be to all of us."
That's really sad that you allowed your opinion of feminism to be ruined by a few extremists. It is reasonable for me to assume that all gamers support Gamergate because of a few extremists?

"What is so bad about doing drugs that it needs justifying? Why would I need to justify my desire to have a beer while I'm at the bar? The bottom line is drugs are a non issue if you have the rest of your life sorted out. If you don't, then yes, drugs can exacerbate your problems."
"Have you ever heard the saying ""don't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm""? If she remained friends with him this is exactly what she'd be doing.

"&gt; He didn't target me, to be fair. I targeted him. He didn't strike me as an almost 30 year old. He struck me as a 25 year old. He thought me older than 18. On our first talk, I revealed I was in university, but was vague about which year (ha). Feelings developed before our ages were revealed. 

Okay, but this happened to me too when I went back to take a class last year. And the difference was, once I found out the person's age I walked away. First because I don't think it's fair for me, as an adult, to influence so much of a person's growth when they're at a pivotal point in life. Second because the more the person talked the more I saw a maturity gap and was turned off. 

Like others have said, you're outgrowing him because he isn't the adult his age would have you think.

"You said she didn't know these people or didn't know them well. Of course she wouldn't have made a scene in front of them because she doesn't know them. People are typically pretty timid when it comes to expressing a different opinion amongst new people. We as people care about how others view us, in varying capacities, but we do. So, she might have felt pressured to stay quiet. You wanted an opinion on the situation and I gave you one. Just because it doesn't validate your opinion doesn't mean that it's wrong."
"I don't think the OP is showing a lack of appreciation.  I think he is thinking big picture.  Her giving habits, while admirable, may not be sustainable in the future if she has a greater amount of expenses.

Not to mention that some people don't have the same opportunities as you to spew pseudo intellectual bullshit in casual interaction."
I'll confront her about it. I also think that this is not healthy for our relationship
"This is the best response ^ my fiance and I were in the same boat as you guys. I am a festival user of the recreational kind and my guy seemed to have a big problem with me doing it, yet couldn't care less if his friends did. I found it kind of hypocritical, because he didn't like it when I was ""messed up"" on drugs (I wasn't, he just assumed that's how it is) yet he was getting super drunk every other weekend, way sloppier than I ever get when I take stuff. Festivals are a HUGE part of my life, and just like the above commenter, molly and psychedelics gave me an outlook on life that has 100% has changed me for the better. I ended up bringing him with me to a festival so he could see what it was like, since he assumed it was just some drug-fuel orgy where people had no morals or dignity. Letting him see that me and my friends were still relatively the same, just happy and carefree and getting better in touch with ourselves and each other, made him change his mind about it. He actually does stuff with me once or twice a year now, and we have had some really incredible moments that brought us closer. Just talk to her, make sure she's safe and testing her stuff, and let her know your fears."

"I'm going to share my story with you because I was surprised with a similar situation. 

I had told my now fiance that I wanted a moissonite ring because I didn't want to support the diamond trade or have expectations of him spending a ton of money on a piece of jewelry. 

He proposed with a ring that looked very vintagey and explained that his mom gave him his grandmother's ring and he had the diamonds reset into a vintage estate sale setting. He told me about how he spent weeks going back and forth with the jeweler to find a setting that suited me. 

This surprised me, but it is really meaningful because instead of him just spending some cash, he had it designed and the combo of heirloom diamonds and a vintage setting means it's truly one of a kind. The effort he put into it means so much to me too. Also, having a good relationship with the in-laws is hugely important to me, so it means a lot that his mom wanted me to have her mom's ring. 

In the end, it's not what I originally envisioned but it's meaningful in a different way almost. Can you guys look into having the stones reset and make it into something one of a kind that's just yours?"

You're upset that he couldn't find the motivation to resolve his issues for your sake, and for the sake of your relationship. You're upset that something else gave him that push, but you weren't ""good enough"" to do the same. That's a perfectly normal feeling to have - but you already know that it's not rational. You already closed that chapter of your life and you're in a much better place now. Ride the feeling out - you'll be angry for a day or two, but it'll fade, and life will go back to normal."

"You seem pretty naive for thinking a proposal would solve an ongoing problem in your sex life. If anything, getting married now suggests that you're okay with things staying the way they are when that's clearly not the case. 

I'd ask her to see a couples' counselor together before you get married so you can hopefully get to the bottom of whatever's going on. And if you can't, break up. "
"OP, I woke up at 6 am today, helping my friend packing things up and moving, and then back to the old house to help her clean her ginormous house, including the basement. Just done now at 18:55.


What I did today was a real chore...and even then it was **much less** exhausting than the mental gymnastic you are doing right now to get together with this boy. Hasn't the book taught you nothing?"

"He calmly said he would break your cat's neck. 

The thing that usually snaps people into realizing they are in an abusive relationship is when their abuser threatens their pet. Usually it's when they have already decided to leave and they are worried about leaving for their own personal safety but what about their pet? You were basically just told if you leave, I will kill the cat. I'm sorry to say but your life is worth more than the cat's. Can you take your cat and make a Craigslist post saying need a temporary foster home for my kitty so I can flee an abusive situation, absolutely. Should you? OF COURSE! Should you expect your cat 14 months from now? No. But your cat needs out as much as you need out  "
"I think you responded from the wrong account.
"
"uh-you are making a HUGE mistake.

Be honest-if your wife had an affair-lied to you, cheated on you, wasintimate wiht another guy and prioritized him over you-how would you feel if she went to see him over your objections?

This will undo all the work you have done on your marriage-if she doesnt just end up dumping you.  it will make a lie out of everything you have claimed to her in the past 10 years.

Dont do it. Dont even think about it.

What the f* 'closure' are you going to get? You cheated, its over, you are committed to your wife-there is no closure past that."
"Yes... I joke about it myself, speaking to the cat or my SO.

OPs bf though. Psycho. Destroying property because anger? Get the fuck away from that shit OP."
"This is really the best first step, I agree. They both will have state specific advice.

Also, start putting together every piece of evidence (text, email, voicemail, Facebook message, piece of mail etc) you have of them harassing or threatening you, right now. You will need these to present to the police/a lawyer.

Even if the police can't do anything right now, start documenting everything with them. Dates, times, etc. of each incident. Official paper trail of the incident will be very useful in putting together a solid argument for a restraining order.

Also, invest in security cameras for your home, and your BILs home. Keep a copy of the VM from them regarding BILs address, so when they come round to his place, you will be producing evidence that they follow through with their threats."
You shouldn't get involved. Staying quiet is 100% the right thing to do here. 
You hold on a minute. There are situations where cheating is excusable and understandable? And why does the sister need to forgive him just because the mother did?  
yes!  I mean I probably pissed away 100k on *beer* before I finally settled down and no cosmic karma to show for it. And it took me way longer than 25 to bank 90k.
"It sounds like maybe there's more to the story since you say this is the first time it's ever been like this (and you say he was so emotional it seemed like there was more to the story).

I'd try to talk to him about it again and ask if there's more to the story.

Honestly, I can empathize with him.  If someone I was dating (but not yet engaged/married to) took a job at my old company I would have a very hard time sticking around in the relationship.  I have too much rage about how people were treated there and how they handled blatant and known sexual assault and harassment on the part of managers."
She may qualify for FMLA and most employers are sympathetic to family emergencies like this. 
"I'm the opposite myself. Once I get settled into a new job/field, I'm much better about communication but when I'm transitioning, I tend to forget everything. I worked one of these jobs that required me to do stuff off-hours on tight deadlines, and I was forgetting basic things like eating and not missing my train home let alone messaging others. Time just passed by much quicker than I anticipated too. I'd tell myself I'd eat lunch at 1 instead of noon, and the next time I look at the clock it's suddenly 7PM and the night janitor is coming in to clean my office. It's definitely not healthy, but I wouldn't be quick to think it's intentionally rude because I can be pretty absent minded to that extent.

Also I had to do a double check on your username. Haha nice seeing you outside of /r/NFL."
"This whole thread is blowing my mind, to be honest.  I am with you - if dogs are important to you, and he knew that going into the marriage, and you kept him in the loop about getting the third dog, he literally has no room to complain.  Additionally, these are working dogs, which are a different thing than pets (even if they weren't the point still stands). You plan ahead for them, manage your life around them, etc.  He has to know this.  FWIW I wouldn't have considered getting married to someone who didn't want dogs, because they are that important to me.  So, the only reasonable answer is that something happened to change his mind.  I am going to say counseling is probably the only answer here - you need to figure out what changed and why he suddenly isn't on board.  It isn't on you to compromise, IMO."
"If your parents are conservative and you feel like they aren't going to accept your reason for divorcing your husband as valid...you NEED a backup plan, because if they side with your husband, you are going to be fucked without one.

I've seen this kind of thing happen with conservative (especially religious) family members, where they side with the ex instead of the person they're related to because they don't approve of divorce, or the reason, or the the leaver should have tried harder or prayed more or whatever."
"Are you friggin kidding me? He hasn't been complaining about his coworkers fucked up personal lives and somehow that makes him more likely to cheat? That's a huge stretch and his wife needs to trust her husband and his judgement. He isn't going to suddenly think it's ok to cheat just because a few people at work do. He doesn't even socialize with them outside of work, their behavior isn't going to ""rub off in him."" He doesn't see it as normal just because others are making that mistake. Give him a little credit. "

"If every birthday in his entire life has sucked the problem is him and his sucky attitude.

"First, you may want to have a conversation with your girlfriend to make sure you are on the same page about how to deal with her father. In what ways do you want to hold your ground, and in what ways are you willing to be flexible?

I think there are ways for you to have this conversation with her father that respect his perspective without allowing him to impose his values on your life. If he brings these things up, emphasize the emotions behind them rather than the specifics. What he is really asking is: will you keep my daughter safe? will I have grandchildren? will you respect my values?

For example, if he wants to know if you'll protect his daughter when the economy collapses, you could say something like, ""I promise I will always do everything I can to keep Mildred safe and protect our family."" If he wants to talk about when you have children, you could say something like, ""Mildred and I are excited to start a family together. That's important to us.""

Exact wording depends on what is true for you, what you feel comfortable saying, etc. But it should be possible to validate his concerns to a certain extent, and doing that should make it less painful when you do have to push back. After all, in a certain sense, you and he want the same thing (for his daughter to be happy and safe), you just differ on the details. So focus on the big picture, which is what you have in common!"

"Think of your relationship like this: let's say you have an amazing sandwich. Succulent slices of turkey, perfectly baked bread, the best cheese, and your favorite mayo all layered in. You love this sandwich and eating this sandwich makes you very happy. This is the best sandwich you've ever had, and you know that you want to keep eating this sandwich forever. 

... The only issue with the sandwich is that there is a turd tucked in between the succulent slices of turkey. No matter how great and amazing and perfect the other sandwich ingredients are it still doesn't change the fact that you are eating a shit sandwich. 

While this turd is just one ingredient in a large and otherwise great sandwich, and doesn't change how wonderful the other ingredients taste and how much you love those other parts of the sandwich, the presence of even a little bit of poop still ruins the *whole* sandwich. 

Don't eat a sandwich with any amount of poop in it, and don't stay in a relationship with someone who doesn't respect you and puts you down. Just like there are tons of sandwiches out there that are entirely poop-free, there are tons of guys out there who are able and willing to show their partner the respect and support they deserve. Respect from your partner is not something you should have to fight them to get. If he doesn't respect you and actively puts you down then this relationship is not one you should be in. "
"It took me a couple of reads but correct me if I'm wrong isn't your bad health and bad neck completely your own doing because you have been going to sleep at 2am* only to get 3 hours uninterrupted sleep each night? You didn't have to do that. You could have gone to bed at 11 because as you say you rarely disturb her when you do.

I'm a night owl too but I opt to stay up that late only occasionally because real life gets in the way.

I appreciate how it's frustrating she found your new routine disturbed her sleep last night, but that was just one night. It will take time, no need to give up so easily. I don't think it's fair to make her the bad guy in this situation.

If I am missing something I think it's to do with this:

&gt; and to give her the space to unwind and relax

If her version of relaxing is being away from her partner then that's a very bad sign. Also how often have you been having sex the past 10 months? I can't help but feel this post focuses on the wrong problem."
Hm. Just a thought but getting her refusal in writing might be a good idea for your sister. 
Hire a nanny. Don't expect free service from your MIL. Show some respect for the old lady who is trying to help you out. You would understand her situation only when you get old and when you get kicked out rudely by your DIL.  Having a family around is a blessing in these times and there are multiple ways to spend your lone time :-)
"Maybe ask her to ask him if she can tell you?

But, I agree, you can't just rock up to him and be like "" Yo, your sis told me you like dudes - here's all my thoughts on that."""
"Haha. When I was toddler (maybe a bit older), I remember being a bit troubled by people with learning disabilities which i guess is normal for kids to be scared by anything that's different or hard to read. My grandma encouraged me to play with a child who had down syndrome and I remember having quite a few pleasant playdates with him. That was probably abuse according to ij_brunhauer *eyeroll*"
"&gt; I feel like I've already taken myself out of the relationship but seeing her cry kills me and I can't seem to get past that point.

You do very much sound like you've already mentally checked out of this relationship. Seeing a person you care about cry (especially if you're the reason for their distress) is damn hard, but you're going to have to remind yourself that she deserves someone who *actually* loves her and who will gladly plan that wedding with her and be as excited about it as she is. 

Staying out of pity is bad for everyone involved, and having to file a divorce is far more difficult and painful than breaking up a relationship."
"Look at it this way, there are people who pay a lot more than $10,000 to learn a tough life lesson (divorce).  You can get out now before this guy has a legal right to a portion of your livelihood and wastes anymore of your time.

Usually, the advice on this sub is to talk it out or get into couple's counseling, but this one is pretty cut-and-dry.  Take some time to heal and then get back out there because someone will treat you the way you deserve to be treated, especially when you're such a giving person who has their own life together."
"I got the same impression as you did. There's definitely a difference between ""I participate in fetish shows."" ""Oh that's interesting, do you do porn as well?"" and ""I participate in fetish shows."" ""You're OK with being naked on stage? What's next, porn?"""
"&gt; It's unkind to try to give him hints using social cues that he probably hasn't learned.

I just want to emphasize this. OP, if you're having trouble letting him down because you don't want to hurt his feelings, please keep in mind that not addressing this in a way that he can understand is also unkind. Don't feel bad for having to be direct and draw a boundary, you'll both be better off for doing so."

If your SO has been telling them off and they keep it up, they aren't very good friends. "
"First of all, it's ""theirs"". 

Second of all, damn OP. You may need to talk to your boss about them sexually harassing you, because that's what they are doing. They are making your workplace hostile and treating you like an object. 

No bueno. "
"Not much information there for us to work with, but sounds like it's been a long time coming, unfortunately. 

I say this because what your wife is saying all implies too little, too late. You knew she wanted to spend more time with the kids at home and still you didn't try and support her. It's only now, that she's leaving you, that you suddenly spur into action. 

I doubt a mother of 2 would just up and split without some sort of warning. The signs have probably been there, but you've chosen to ignore them, or at least not act on them. 

Way it goes, fella. I hope, in your next romantic venture, that you've taken what's happened here and used it to better yourself. "

"You're not wrong, but neither is she.

To most people getting married is a major life event that traditionally is a celebration with family and friends.  Presumably your mom loves you a lot, and probably wants to witness and be a part of your life as much as possible.  It's obviously entirely up to you as to how you get married, but it's totally reasonable for your closest family/friends to be hurt/disappointed that they are left out.  It sounds like your mom's behavior fits this exactly - she's happy for you but very disappointed she won't be there with you."
"Search for groups like ""New moms in X"", ""Young moms support"" or similar. My friend was in a similar situation and joined one of these, they meet up and do fun things, like going out to restaurants, parks, workshops or whatever with their kids. They usually don't know each other before and the conversation always gets going thanks to the kids, so it's not really awkward. It helped her a lot, even having some adult conversation was a big deal. Maybe they have something like that in your area!"
Take back your security by breaking up with her so she can go find a photographer boyfriend and you can find someone who appreciates you for who you are.
"Somehow I can burp, fart, pee, give birth, throw up, and it all in front of my husband and he still finds me very sexy and we have great regular sex. It's amazing how someone can see you as an equal and respect that we have normal bodily functions. "
"A very, very disturbed young woman. She comes and goes, but often posts in bursts. She has a new username every few hours. For over a year now. She is actually clinically insane; we deduce she's been in and out of mental hospital, and we deduce she keeps stopping her meds, resulting in batshit behaviour. The egregeous case was where she had 1-2 dates with an older guy, behaved insanely, and so he backed slowly away, after which she began a campaign of revenge (tyre slashing etc). Poor girl doesnt need this sub, she needs restraining and meds and so forth, which she gets, but not 24/7

We are getting fairly good at spotting her, but sometimes she slips through the net. the clue here is that she is OBSESSED with the fact that she believes herself to be utterly, irresistably, unimprovably beautiful and it drives her quite literally insane if people dont keep acknowledging it"
"All I can say is she must be hot for you to forgive so much. You can do better, man. "

"Refuse the open relationship.  Continue with counseling.

You had his child 3 months ago.  His priority should be you and his child, not his dick.  He needs to get his priorities straight.  

Maybe sometime down the road you can explore an open relationship, but now is definitely not the appropriate time.   But when you do, he says home with the kid while you fuck someone else as a test run.  That's the best way for him to determine if an open relationship is truly what he wants."
Your boyfriend is abusing and gaslighting you. He's gaslighting you so blatantly that you need to be concerned for your safety. Do not underestimate this guy.

"You're not overreacting. But your problem isn't with Ben. It's with your girlfriend. I'm not sure what kind of game she's playing, but she seems to be enjoying it and encouraging it. Sending you photos of him and then purposely ignoring you is just plain mean.

Again...this is happening because she allows it. It's not hard for a woman to get rid of even the most persistent guys, esp when she's dating someone. So I guess you can either continue to put up with it, or find someone a little more mature. If I was in your shoes, her behavior (not her friendship with another man) would be a dealbreaker. "
"Also, if she's depressed, moving doesn't magically fix that. Speaking from loads of personal experience of various family members and myself. She's blaming it on her location but it's probably not that."

anyone who can stitch that thought together has to be daft. 



But hey, I dont know your bf from Jack. I think you should talk to him about the possibility of having short kids, weak kids, kids with birth defects, kids with learning or growth disabilities. Its possible he has never thought of the other side of parenting - the part you dont see on tv - and just thinks that children with disabilities are a rare occurrence that can never happen to him. If you can have a reasonable conversation about it and he is able to drop his obsession with his height with respect to child rearing, I'd say he's in the clear. "

"I'm not going to deny that you no doubt hear whispers from time to time, but at a certain point, I think you have to maintain a bit of honesty with yourself that some of this commentary might be in your head or exaggerated.  Like you are reading into the thoughts of the people around you and assuming you are at the forefront of all of them.  Most people, most of the time, don't care about you or think a second thought about you.  Again, I get that *some* people do go out of their way to say or do cruel things, and unfortunately, there's not much to be done about them.  So, I understand needing to have your defenses up and ready.  However, if everything around you must go through this filter surrounding your body type, then you are only going to live in this world of people who either go to the extreme of insulting you or the extreme of fetishizing you with the ambivalent people being invisible to you.  You need to make these people who don't really have a strong feeling about your weight more visible to you, which means participating in groups and events that don't really focus so much on your weight.  I know your appearance will always get ahead of you in any introduction, but there's no fix to that, only manage it.  And, managing it means putting yourself in situations where you have a better chance of showing other thoughts and feelings that go beyond your identity as a plus size woman."
"I don't know the details of the technical side of the issue.. but I'm gonna assume your problem is you're worried that your friend knows that you stalk her online.  What you call 'slick' and 'creeping', most of us call 'stalking'.

Stop looking for a way to have your cake and eat it too.  You can't be a stalker while appearing non-stalky to your friends.  You can start fixing it by just coming clean, and saying you're sorry.  Then it's up to them what to do from there."

steady on there... will nobody think of the *children*..."
"Nope nope nope. Kids don't fix problems, they just add more stress and will break a strained relationship.

&gt; She refuses to see anyone about her depression because she says she knows why she's sad, and that's because her life is shit.

I was gonna ask if she considered counseling/therapy for her depression, but the answer's here. And I have a bad feeling about this. I've had depression, it rarely gets better on it's own. If you just let it fester, you bring down everyone else around you.  

Marriage counseling would be a good idea for you both as well. Do you think you could get her to do that for the sake of your marriage?  You need to decide if this relationship is worth saving, or if you'd both be better off on your own.

&gt; She's never actively looked for a job, but has always asked me to apply to jobs for her, which I've done ever since we met. I found her a part-time job while we were dating, I applied to a (kinda crappy) college for her studies, and I applied for a ton of jobs and courses in this new country.

This relationship sounds pretty draining for you... it'd probably be better if you guys split up honestly."
"She's had 2 marriages, a daughter, and another abusive ex story (separate from the above, who nonetheless got his claws in deep enough to require family intervention) all by the tender age of 24.  Patience doesn't seem to be her strong suit.

Luckily, this is fixable.  Nothing a little more time &amp; maturity can't mend.  Thank heavens hubby #2 no longer wants to father children with her -- consider it a bullet dodged!"
"Good grief, this is not the resolution I expected to read. I wonder if boss is afraid of being sued for age discrimination if she fires this lady? That would make sense of her announcing her age over and over.

I would go back to HR and let them know that you are dealing with a hostile work environment, especially because boss did not keep your complaint confidential. I would also insist to both boss and HR that she has her workstation changed, because you should not be subjected to her harassment and retaliation. If they don't want to do deal with her problematic behavior, fine, but the least they can do then is put her somewhere else so you can work in peace. And reiterate to HR that boss' method of handling this has resulted in coworker harassing you, which is unacceptable.

I'm really sorry you have to deal with this- you'd think people would grow up at some point, instead of morphing into a 58 year old drama llama. "
Isn't it nice when a person reveals their flaws before you've invested any time in dating them?

"Just as an FYI... your co-worker is in a protected class. That's most likely why she continued reminding your boss of her age and why the boss allowed her to yell. If Office-mate is terminated she could file a complaint with the EEO and/or file a lawsuit. 

Your company needs a well documented file to be able to show cause why they let her go. For that reason, I would continue to go to HR when you have serious, work-related complaints about her. Document as much as you can about her behavior. As hard as it will be, treat her with courtesy. Do NOT retaliate. If you can do that, you'll be helping your company out big time."
"Don't get involved with her. She needs to be focusing on starting a life as a mom, not dating around. "
Living with them does not entitle them to know everything about your relationship.
"A better example is probably weight. Maybe a person would be OK with a partner who was 10-20 lbs overweight, but them increasing it to 40-50 lbs would kill their attraction. 

And we can argue on the morality of this situation forever, but human attraction cannot be logic-ed out. A person cannot be forced to find something attractive, nor can they ignore a lack of attraction even if they desperately wanted to. "

You are.

He doesn't want dog.  You want dog.  One person is going to lose here.  The best you can do is compromise.  "
She's at the very least extremely co-dependent with severe OCD and anger management issues. No kid should be in that environment. 
I hear that it is an invasion of privacy. I can see that point for sure. Some people myself included don't really care about that kind of thing. I guess if I was OP I would be more concerned that my wife felt like she needed to go through my phone as opposed to the breach of privacy.

"&gt; Honestly, if my husband had two houses, 2 online businesses and he was happy, I would be happy and find any job I could because we would have a pretty good set up. I wouldn't care that it wasn't what I went to school for.

I'm the opposite. I'd be miserable just working any job, just to work. I'm the sort that lives to work. I need to enjoy what I do and I need to see a career path that moves me up the corporate ladder. I've worked just to get a pay cheque and it left me miserable, depressed, and feeling worthless. I need a job I feel passionate about, and provides me stimulation and satisfaction; without that I feel like shit. It doesn't have to be in my field, but a job for the sake of a job sounds like my 4th circle of hell.

"Hmmmm it's kind of interesting that what you don't like about your dad is that he tells your mom how to think and feel instead of letting her have her own thoughts and emotions.

But when your mom called you saying she was afraid (emotion) of losing the house if she divorced, you told her to do it anyway. 

I wonder what it would be like for you to validate your mom's emotions instead. What would it be like for you to say, ""Mom I hear you're afraid that if you leave, no one will mow the lawn/ keep the house/take care of brother. I hear what's important to you is keeping things together as much as you can.""

What might your mom say to that, if you really heard her perspective? Do you think it might empower her to make her own decisions, if she felt that someone in the family heard her, without judgement? Do you think she would feel more supported if you validated her emotion, or less?

Good luck. It's really hard to be in your position. But I bet you can decline to be in the middle and still offer your mom a place to be heard."

"That's good, but that's what friend zoning is. If you use the term like you did, it could imply you agree with it. "
"Oh bud, is that how you're asking women out? Maybe try something like ""hey you seem really cool. I'd really like to get to know you better. Could we grab coffee?"" It gives off more of a ""let's go on one casual date and see"" vibe rather than the more high school ""wanna go out"" which seems like jumping into something bigger.

"I don't think she's being unreasonable, just clueless and desperate. Not giving her a reason will come off as rude. Maybe...

Damn that was easy."
Virginity always seems to be a weird topic with dudes. Just ask him why it matters so much because honestly it shouldn't.
The way he reprimands you on table manners and insists you do things a certain way really does seem as though he's treating you like a child. Time to speak up and tell him you're perfectly capable of cutting vegetables and purchasing a car by yourself because you're a grown woman who can take care of herself.

"My ex was like this.
Girls shouldn't burp, shouldn't fart, shouldn't sweat or smell. Essentially shouldn't have bodily functions at all, and above all else, never talk about them! Also be perfectly made up at all times, and hairless, and also never need time to get ready, or for personal grooming, and again, never ever talk about it, or show evidence of said grooming. And any of the above would be ""un-sexy"" and a ""mood-killer"". (He did say he was ""only joking"" about all of the above, but it came up daily/weekly, so methinks not so much.)

However, he was free to fart, stink up a room, play pranks, not flush the toilet when it was gross, be dirty and stinky, and generally act like 7 year old. Because apparently ""thats what boys are like"".

We dated for almost 3 years, and were in our mid-30s. (No, I don't know what I was I thinking.) 

So I say to you: do you want to a fully fledged human being, or do you want to twist yourself up in knots trying to be his idea of womanhood? Because you can only be one of those things, the other you will always fail and always fall short of."
you are a treasure. a gem.
"This is a really good way to open the conversation. You're absolutely right; this really isn't about the proposal. It's about how she acts as I move forward with my life without her being directly a part of it. 

Thank you."
"Lazy winds don't bother going around you, they just go straight through instead :)  we have an electric shower so our hot water doesn't really run out. Maybe a good idea for you? "
"A lot of people with mental illness involving psychosis aren't able to see clearly enough to realise they need help. If you're hallucinating you aren't generally capable of the judgement necessary to accurately perceive what's happening to you. At that point you need professional help, because there's little you can do for yourself."
"Sometimes it's OK to be a b-word. ""I'm not interested in you and never will be because I find you unattractive. Your territorial pissing will get you nowhere with me, has ended this friendship, and has exposed you for a pathetic loser. And I don't hang out with those. Keep my name out of your mouth and your eyes to yourself from now on."""
"It's not the observation, it's the sexual connotation of his word-choice 
    
    
I personally wouldn't be mad at my husband for saying that, but it would certainly be really tacky"
"The pilot of Star Trek: Enterprise has a rather sexualized half-naked scene. There's an interview with the male actor involved who says filming it wasn't sexy at all - the gel was cold, the set lights were hot, a million crew buzzing around watching, cameras rolling, etc etc. There's just so much going on on set that little ""real"" emotion can manifest there, plus you are drawing from your own experiences to fake romance with the other actor, not having a genuine connection.

That said, I personally would not want to date an actor. Just wouldn't be my thing to watch them pretend to be intimate with someone else. But, my boyfriend is not an actor, so this kind of conflict would never come up. I can see where he is coming from, but I never would have put myself in a position where I am silently rooting for my SO to never get their big break to spare my own jealousy. Totally unfair to the aspiring-actor SO. Maybe your boyfriend just isn't cut out to date an actress - unfortunate you're five years in and just getting a big break and you're both coming to this realization, but hey, better late than never.

Don't turn down the job. Discuss with him the lack of real emotion towards your co-star when you are acting, but if he can't stomach it, break up and keep the role."
"You are both 18. This is normal. 

But don't wait around for her."
"Do you really want to be with your ex? You say he broke up with you over trust issues, and while planning to get back together you go skinny dipping and make out with someone else? You seem to be sabotaging this on purpose. Are you sure you want to be in a relationship? "
Admittedly I do like some of his more bluesy stuff. I also enjoy the song Edge of Desire. But it has taken on a whole new level. I guess I'm nervous about slipping up or that this whole thing has blown up way too far
"Thanks for offering your perspective! I didn't mean to give the impression that I want him on some sort of schedule. I'm not anywhere near that much of a neat freak. It's only that with the dogs we have, there are very noticeable tumbleweeds and slobber marks by day 2. 

I agree with you on the salary point, which is why it wasn't included originally. I'll always make more money than he does (re: life not being fair) so that doesn't factor into my concern at all. It's only a matter of time.

I like your idea of being a good coworker though. I'll always be willing to pitch in if he's drowning under his workload, and I'll be sure to tell him that. Thanks again!"
"My husband has a bad job of not expressing his preferences and current interests.

It makes it very difficult to treat him to anything special or to buy gifts. And it means that I have to be in my toes to catch him expressing interest in anything. 

A couple of months ago I brought home an energy drink for him, because I spotted the one he usually grabs at the store. He thanks me and then says that he decided weeks before to stop drinking them. Dude, why didn't you tell me? Now I have to figure something else out grrrr"
"This sounds like the backstory to something that's going to end up on /r/JUSTNOMIL/. I can't decide if I should send you there so you can keep your eye out for more potential crazy, or if it's just going to freak you out. It's a great community for support, if this BS continues, anyway."
it's a courtesy thing. it really isn't asking a lot from your partner to just wanna keep in touch and know what's up. the fact that you're so aggressively against it is suspicious.
"It's is pretty normal to check in with your spouse anytime you're going to spend time with an ex, yes. It is also normal to check in anytime you're not going to be home at the expected time. "
"There is a real possibility she will try to break into your house and destroy the book ""to protect you"". Be prepared for something like that. 

She definitely has some sort of psychotic ideation/schizophrenia. Typically it's not helpful to play along and confirm their hallucinations, so you getting rid of the book would calm the current crisis but wouldn't help in the long term, she does not need to be enabled. So you did well there. 

She definitely needs to be in therapy (likely medicated), but I don't know how to get her there if her parents are no help either.  You can try and distance yourself from her but be prepared she may continue to harass you for a long time. Just ignore everything, and report to police if anything starts to feel threatening to you and your partner. "
"OP, I think you need to think carefully about what you want.

There are MANY people who do not believe they should stop existing as a person just because of a baby. I personally agree. I do not think anyone's entire identity should be boiled down to ""mother"" or ""father"" just because a baby came. 

Yes, you can prioritize the baby, and of course you should - but if you completely lose yourself in the process, your own identity, your own happiness - that's usually not good for the kid's development when they grow up. 

Your wife wants to still feel like a woman, and a person with hobbies and interests, not just a mother.

It seems you were raised different, and to you a baby means you need to stop existing and become only ""father"". 

Both views seem to be common. But I do think yours is much more harmful long term. This is usually how dead bedrooms start, and when your child is grown up enough to be independent, you will no longer have an exciting relationship with your wife to fall back on. If you tell your wife to give everything up, even some fun money, for the kid, you will have a resentful wife who is only a shell of a person. 

Treating yourself sometimes is NOT a sign of immaturity or childishness, especially since this is the first time in 6 months she's done it. What it does mean is your wife is confident in who she is as a person, and wants to do the bare minimum to maintain her own identity. Of course, the advice would be totally different if she was doing this frequently, in debt, not caring about the baby, etc. But that's not your case. If there is no financial troubles, no debt, and she has generally spent her money on the baby, you need to ask yourself why it's so important that she sacrifices _everything_ for this baby when it's not necessary to do so to live happily. Do you feel resentful? Do you feel like you aren't a good parent until every last bit of yourself is dedicated to this baby? Where do those thoughts come from? Parental pressure? Cultural pressure? Do you feel sometimes you don't measure up to other dads? Are you worried about being a dad, and are trying to compensate with materialistic measures? 

Basically, why do you feel like your old life needs to stop completely now that you have children? Wouldn't your children want to know their parents are people too and not just robo-trons? 

When your kid grows up and realizes that his parents' entire life revolves around him and they don't have their own life anymore, do you think that will make him feel better? Do you think it will teach him independence?  

As an anecdote, my partner's parents are like this, everything went to the kids, they lived for the kids. He's really worried about what will happen when the youngest is gone, because his parents have no identity anymore, and it's actually created more burden on the three of them who feel tasked to provide excitement and adventure in their parents' lives. "
"This is barely coherent and the way you describe things is really off putting. ""Half a cripple""? Really?


Either way you sound unhappy and should break up. Maybe work on yourself. "
She's very nice... Until you do something she disapproves of. That isn't the kind of person you should want to spend your life with. 
"There is no compromise, you already tried that, remember? You were going to sell a few and keep your favorites. She didn't want to compromise with you. Her way or no way. 

Sorry dude, but someone who just refuses hands down to compromise about something so important to you is not someone worth being in a relationship with. "
"What are you getting out of this relationship? Cause it seems like he is very controlling (while being a lazy parent) and doesn't care about you or your needs.

Its time to put your foot down. He gets pissy and defensive because his feelings are hurt? Don't care, he's trampled all over yours and your boundaries. Stand your ground and insist he seek out counseling for his controlling ways. He is damaging his relationship with you AND his daughter"
"I think it's fair to say ""I love you and want you to be happy and healthy. I think we can all agree that this sucks, and you don't want it to happen again, right? So what are you going to do differently going forward?"" See what they have to say for themselves.

I would 100% push for her to consider an IUD. It's a one-time thing that will keep them reliably baby-free for years, probably until she's actually ready for a kid. Come armed with information. What are the IUDs available where you live, and their respective pros and cons? How much will it cost, and can you help them cover it if necessary? Where near them can she get one? It's not your responsibility to do all the research for them, but if you do, I think that maximizes the chance of follow-through."
Man fuck that. The POINT of a partner is to be able to share your small quirks without judgement. Be glad it's been only 6 months 
"&gt; I wasn't sure what to be sorry for as it was something small to me and not a big deal.

One of the most important things you need to understand is that just because something isn't a big deal *to you*, doesn't mean it's not a big deal to someone else. You are not The Most Objective Unbiased Person In The World, and you don't get to unilaterally decide that something that someone else is upset about isn't worth being upset about. 

You need to start accepting that your wifes point of view is just as valid as yours."
"&gt; I ask myself that question and all I can come up with is companionship.

You can find companionship with other women. Women who appreciate what you do for him and want you to be their partner rather than caretaker. Right now you are a caretaker."
"&gt; I think if he doesn't want to stop despite clearly seeing how much it distresses you, he's addicted. 

Some people just don't like to stop normal, harmless and important-to-them behaviors because someone else doesn't like them. Drinking, smoking pot, going to clubs, attending church service, having opposite-sex friends or being really into horses are all examples of things a partner might take issue with, yet most people keep doing.

OP is dating someone who enjoys watching porn. He gets to decide if he watches porn or not. She gets to decide if she wants to keep dating someone who watches porn. That's it.

Not being a complete pushover or susceptible to emotional pressuring is not a sign of porn addiction. "
"AGREE! This was a ""surprise"" purchase after partner did well financially this summer."
"I don't know why you're getting so much pushback -- ignorance and anti-abortion sentiment? It sounds to me like you're doing exactly the right thing. Were you able to get info on appropriate dosages? If so, proceed in good conscience.

Thank you for being such a good and supportive sister and friend to your brother and his girlfriend. "
Ask if he wants to go in on a two-bedroom. Sounds like that's what he wants you to do but he doesn't know how to articulate it because he probably feels like it would be demanding of him to do so.
"I would absolutely hate this. No problem at all with male/female friendships, even exes but things that cross my lines are:
1. Talking about problems or private relationship shit
2. Any chat about sex life (yours, theirs, the popes)
3. Not constant communication. Like these chats need to be things that don't take up a bunch of time &amp; don't happen every bloody day.


She's doing a whole bunch of shady shit. I mean don't snoop, it's fucked but holy shit I can see why you did."
Tell your boyfriend and  never be alone  with Leonard. 
"You need to forgive yourself for snooping - you were right! She's being shady and inappropriate and is clearly coveting the sexual attention of this man. That doesn't mean she has physically cheated, but she is seeking sexual attention when she asks him about her butt. You were rightfully suspicious of her behavior, don't forget that.  

Be honest about your suspicions and what you did. Do not let her make your snooping the focus of the conversation. You were trying to get a better understanding of your relationship, she is stepping out on your relationship."
"What an ass.

Him, not you.

You're just trying to do your best by someone who doesn't deserve it. I doubt this is the first time he's pulled this sort of thing. "
"If you stay, he is going to take you down with him. I guarantee it."
"Being online, you could be dog, man, child, Morty. I didn't mean a single offence nor did it cross my mind it might've been a trans person. I honestly thought it was a bored 50 year old man. "
"I'm sorry, I don't think you're going to get any money from your MIL, either explicitly or tacitly in the form of childcare.  You may be better off asking her to move out.

* Have you spoken with a financial planner to see if there are any changes you can make that might help?    
* If your MIL moved out, could you rent out rooms for additional income??
    
* If your BIL and SIL move their stuff out, could you rent out those rooms for cash?  Sounds like this would be at the end of the year but could work, maybe they would bring the schedule forward.  Can MIL live with them once they get their house set up?    
* Can you sell the tools and lawn equipment for short term cash flow?

* How large is the garden/land?  Can any be rented out?   
* Can you grow food to reduce food cost?    

* How many vehicles do you have, can you sell any?

* Did the shoddy renovations get fixed?  Is the house sellable?  What if you sold and moved to a different (smaller) property?   


You may need to have a very very very blunt conversation with your wife about possibly selling the house and downsizing.

Ask your wife to sell the wedding and engagement rings and any other jewellry.  That might make it hit home.  You feel the sense of urgency, but it seems she does not."
"One of my boyfriend's had a psychotic break, and the symptoms you list were really similar to his.  Don't delay at all, call his mom right now.  If this progresses he could hurt himself or someone else.  He will be angry at you, probably very angry, but you can't think about that right now.  His age and the symptoms means he needs help right away.

I had to call emergency services on my ex because he locked himself in his room and was screaming at someone who wasn't there and I was scared he would hurt himself.

Call someone right now. "
"~I will be working over 100 hour work weeks in a high pressure environment.

When your wife works 100 hours a week, that's a good time for you to consider doing so.  Same thing with your wife's parents.  That's 7 x 12 hours days, with 16 extra hours fit in there somehow.  I've known people who do that for 2 years, it's likely to cause burnout.  

You're trying to optimize your money/health, not get as much money as possible.  You might make less money if that burns you out."
"Did you bother to *tell* your wife that the reason they all recommended divorce was because of what you told them? Not because they hate her?

That's my guess as to why she's acting this way. If she knows that you were basically shit-talking her and *still* insists on blaming your friends for taking your words to heart, then you have a much deeper issue.

If it's the latter case, I think you need to work on that in marriage counseling. She needs to understand that your relationship was dysfunctional and you communicated that fact to your friends. It's not their fault that they correctly identified the dysfunction and recommended a divorce. 

Beyond that, are you actively telling your friends *good* things about your wife? Do you tell them that you're happy now? Do they treat her poorly or talk shit about her, and if so, do you call them out on it and defend her? Because if not, then this is also your fault."
It seems like you only read the title
"Why are you defending this guy so much? 

I personally feel as if no respectful person would accuse his girlfriend of 'not being good enough to date him' because her company is functioning much better than his."
You sound like a gigantic mommy's boy. No wonder your wife is exasperated

"I mean, look if he's not even wanting to pay 20% child support, the court is NOT gong to look favorably on that. It shows a blatant disregard for the child, and then he has the other problem of proving that he'd be willing to pay far more than that if got 50/50 custody. 

He's stupid. "
"TBH, I think people who can recognize their own immaturity (you are only 21, after all, you ARE immature in a lot of very normal ways) are far more mature than those who think they are this special ""*super* mature for their age"" snowflake. It's like the Dunning-Kruger effect but for maturity."
"Ah, Greek Week. I can smell the lingering perfume of puke and mingled hormonal secretions from here....

Yeah. It is what it is. It seems silly to me now, but god knows it was the zenith of life at the time.

I think she was annoyed that you didn't seem to immediately get the extra-skanky nature of the dance, at which point she felt the need to drive the point well and truly home. So, she seems nice.

Plus I read a few of your responses elsewhere--try at look and honeybun through an older version of you, that kind of man you want to be. What does he think, and how would he act? Then do that."
"Here's the thing: He can say he doesn't want to pay, but if you get a lawyer, he will have to pay.  My ex threatened that I would never see a penny, and never see our kids again if I divorced him.  He was wrong.  Don't let that loser manipulate you.  "
"Neither of you are handling this very maturely.  

Tell him you saw the agreement, let him vent a bit (he'll probably be relieved not to have this hanging over his head).  Then start discussing what you can do together as a team (cut back spending, eat at home more often, cancel vacations, etc.)  And let your kids know in due course as well - the way working life is going, everyone is going to experience a layoff at least once in their life, they need to see how adults bounce back from adversity.

On the plus side, you can help your husband with the job search.  And he can spend more time with the kids.  My dad worked in a cyclical industry and when the layoffs inevitably came, he had a list of projects to do around the house that he finally had time to tackle.

I'm afraid that by keeping it as a 'shameful' thing and hidden away, you won't be able to see if your husband is getting panicked/depressed or picking up a destructive habit like drinking more than usual.  He should get a routine at home like exercising, helping around the house, time with kids in addition to the job search.  

edit:  use this time to get happier and healthier so he kills it during the interviews."
You sound controlling. If you guys live paycheck to paycheck it would stupid of her to turn down a mostly tax free money gig. Its okay if you're uncomfortable with it but she's not doing anything wrong it sounds like a personal problem. If she like the job and makes good money then it makes sense for her and you should support that and enjoy the extra cash flow and work on your insecurities. Whatever reasoning you've given her doesn't cancel out the benefits she finds so I'd say deal with it.

"They're sometimes like that, and it's almost always because they're shitty parents."
"I feel so sad for you both. I wish I had better words of comfort to offer. 

It's hard because as parents we have to make decisions on what is best for our children, until they can make those decisions for themselves. 

I'm just wondering what the purpose of her father's visit would be? Obviously he's coming at it from such a selfish angle and making this all about his desire for forgiveness. Going as far as berating the caretaker and mother of his dying daughter for not accommodating his desires through a social media campaign tells me he's probably not got many slivers of decent human in him.

Which makes me really wonder about the actual visit - that selfishness is sure to extend there. 

Your daughter may ask why he disappeared. 

Why he did what he did? 

Whether he loves her? 

My suspicion is he wouldn't take responsibility for his behaviour and may make things much harder and more difficult for your daughter. 

I'd weigh on the side of not letting him have access. 

Lastly you probably should seek therapy to ensure you are at peace with whatever decision you make. I wish you courage and peace. "
Legit question but this wasn't an afternoon whim. The guy did everything he needed to do and submitted 8 times. He displayed everything needed for this to be taken seriously. And the fact that he was accepted says a hell of a lot. 
"If the situation were reversed I know he'd step and do what I'm doing; I've known him a long time and watched him support his ex while she went through university. He paid their rent, all their bills, and most of their spending money.

If I asked him to start paying 50% our lifestyle would be very different. I'm *fine* paying more right now while his business grows and seeks investment, but.... this attitude makes it hard to want to."
"In Canada (Ontario), if you split the kids 50/50, then the higher earning spouse has to give the lower earning spouse enough money so that their income (including support) is 40% of the others (excluding support)."
"I can only tell you that if you ever have kids yourself one day, you will realize how dramatically damaged and abusive both of your parents are that they normalize and seek out ways to treat you this way. My two daughters are only a little younger than you are and I can safely say that I'd let myself get hit by a car before I allowed, much less **encouraged**, them to be treated that way by anyone. And it coming from your dad? She let you down by condoning his abuse all of your life.

You deserve better. Contact school services for mental health aid on campus. Stay away from them, block their numbers, and contact your school about restricting any and all contact from them. They are not allowed to have any of your information, transcripts, nothing."

"My relationship with my sister is nonexistent, as in no relationship at all."
"&gt;We attended a party on Sunday and I brought up my discomfort to my fiance. To my amazement she said something like ""Well after my dad got in trouble, he needs to show he's not a racist."" I said trouble for what? She told me that maybe 4 years ago he was sanctioned by the University for preferentially hiring whites over Blacks. She said the charges were crap but in this day and age race claims stick and then this came out of her mouth **""you're perfect to show Dad isn't who some people say he is.""**

What did you say to her after this? my god..."
"It sounds like it's time for a ""come to jesus"" talk.  He needs to be aware of the damage he is doing to your relationship before he kills it entirely.  I think you are going to have to force the issue on this one."
"Negligence, plain and simple. She has a duty of care here"
"OP I know this isn't the advice you're looking for, but you sound like a nightmare when it comes to gift giving. Most people would be absolutely delighted for a dinner and drinks for her and friends. Why the pressure for him to prove himself by doing something you consider to be thoughtful?

I'll ignore the escort point as it's kind of in line with your more open relationship. "
"Yes definitely straight up ask her! First off there's nothing wrong with being direct as long as you stay polite. And if she's apparently so clueless that she doesn't understand on her own she should help out, you being direct with her is the only option!"
"&gt; It seems to me that the only way the cat could have gotten out is if my roommate left one of the doors open, then **closed it without checking to see if both cats were in**. Again, everyone knows that the cats are NOT supposed to be outside during the night. 

OP, are you saying every time your roommates close a door to the outside, they are expected to search the entire house until they have accounted for both cats?  Do they have permission to go into your room even if your door is closed?

And if they couldn't find one cat ... what exactly were they supposed to do about that situation?"

"You can just cook the kids' food but not hers, do their laundry but not hers, etc. Trouble is at that point the relationship has kind of fallen apart completely anyway. Maybe have a come to Jesus talk beforehand saying that things are so bad and you're so unsupported that you're going to have to start doing the bare minimum for your own mental health. She may step up, she may fly into a rage that she's not being catered to, but at least you'll know where you stand and can think about your next step. Honestly I'm not sure if this is salvageable - sorry you're going though it. "
"That's either depression or manipulation, and if she keeps refusing treatment / conversation it almost doesn't matter which. Silent treatment is emotionally abusive, just FYI. "
Commenting to say that your fiance is a hero.
"When she first started in on 'the talk', I was definitely trying to express myself. I was very flustered, but I just kept trying to tell her that we're different people. What she perceives as aloof, is just me being my normal shy self. And I find it hard to open up to people. And I understand that she is very outgoing and family-oriented, and I'm not really like that. She didn't understand and just kept going on about my apparent rudeness and bringing up the fact that we missed dinners with them and even mocked me for using a ""I feel sick"" excuse one time. How petty can you get...

I was definitely in a state of shock for most of our conversation, and I definitely didn't articulate as well as I could've. It's taken a few days for her words to sink in. The thought of a 'round two' makes my stomach churn, but maybe it's the best option. Maybe with my fiance there to back me up."
"&gt;I didn't tell my daughter, I didn't tell my ex-wife that I know. I kept it to myself.

Honestly, I think you should have talked to your daughter about it. This is the kind of thing that can *really* mess a person up to learn about later on in life. Although you didn't have the opportunity to tell her from the start of her life (as is recommended for traditional adoptive parents), you had the chance to tell her as soon as you knew.

&gt;""you're not his child"" . . . However, I trusted my wife with something very important

Honestly, in your shoes I think I would be *most* shocked that she apparently feels your daughter isn't your child. That's the *only* way she could deliberately or accidentally say something like that. In her heart of hearts, or boiling just under the surface of her feelings about her step-daughter, she truly doesn't see her as your daughter. That's fucked up. I think you should focus on your daughter first and reach out to her. Let her know how you feel about her (i.e. you love her and always will), and let her know that blood does not define family. It's the truth. Apologize for keeping her in the dark. Give her space and time if she needs it, but don't just disappear. Also give your ex a head's up about what's gone on, and apologize to her for confiding in someone who was untrustworthy.

I would then look closer at your wife. What kind of step-mom can she be if she doesn't respect your relationship with your daughter? How much can she respect *you* if she really feels your child isn't ""yours"" just because she's not your blood relative?"
"I don't know man, if this was happening to me and my partner was completely unwilling to talk about it I might have to drop the whole ""I think it's time to spend some time apart"" conversation and ask her to find somewhere else to stay for a couple of weeks, and if she's willing to talk about it she knows where to find you, but if she wants to chase smoke and mirrors she ought to at least have the decency to break up with you before doing it, and not trying to keep one foot in your marriage.

Discussion with people who believe those kinds of things is rarely productive."
"Thats not ""showing integrity or balls"" its showing insecurity and desperation, which may have been the catalyst for why shes moving on from you. Because thats really what this is. She may not have phrased it as a break up, but it sure sounds like one and she was letting you down easy. You may want to read the writing on the wall and start moving on. Telling her to fuck off or confessing your love for her is not going to work. Become independent, work on yourself, and live your life. "
"She's 20 and doesn't know how to process this, at worst she thinks less of you because of you're condition. 

Going to have to wait for her to think it through so you can speak to her and find out what she's feeling. Then let her know your needs for support and disappointment at her response. 

Most 20 year olds aren't married or have to deal with this. She likely never dealt with it before, may not even really know what bipolar disorder is. Communication"
I hope so too but it's like something just clicked into place.
"The notice is necessary. Look up the landlord tenant law in your state and municipality. Usually it's 30 days, but it depends, so look it up and inform yourself.

"Generally, the advice is ""everyone has a past, get over it""...but that amount of over-sharing is tacky and unkind.  It's bragging and it's purpose is selfish.  If they don't being it up anymore thats good, but you can't unhear it.  "
There's a vast difference between signing up for this kind of situation because it's your kink and having it forced on you without your consent.
"I'm Catholic, and I think what you're asking for is pretty unreasonable, outside of the tiny pool of VERY devout Catholic women who feel the same way you do. 

I'm not sure where you live, but I'd say the only way to meet someone local, outside of Catholic dating sites, is maybe through a church. Could you get involved in some sort of volunteer project? Or maybe find a Catholic university near you? 

My best piece of advice: give up the BC thing. There are Catholic women out there you would be compatible with (no sex before marriage, for example) who would probably check all your boxes EXCEPT for the BC thing. 

Another thing I'd urge you to do is speak about this with a priest. The priests at my high school (Catholic) were very progressive and, while they might not tell you outright to forego the no BC requirement, they might help you feel less guilty about learning to accept that your partner may want to use it. Trust me, as a fellow (albeit casual) Catholic, I understand the guilt involved in a lot of things our religion preaches. "

"OP though the posters above are taking the point to the extreme, but bringing his grandparents may have not been the most sensitive thing to say however factual it may be. However his abusive and petty behaviour without a thought to what was going on in your life is alarming indeed. What happens if your parents down the line need your support and he throws a tantrum like this ....or like even your kids need you.   

&gt;  I received 4 abusive messages calling me fucking useles    
&gt; My Fiancé told me to 'Have a nice life’  
&gt; and he called me 22 times.

PLEASE put off the wedding - this is a serious issue that needs resolution. It will cause anger and hurt in future for sure. "
"&gt; She really has no friends besides me, she is constantly calling me while I am at work just to say hello. She calls at least 5 times a day and expects me to talk every time, because she doesn't say nothing besides ""just wanted to say hello""

She can't be doing that while you're at work. Doesn't matter if she just wants to say hi and then there's dead silence, you are at work and that can potentially get you in trouble. 

&gt;  She spends the afternoons at home doing nothing. She doesn't seem worried about looking for, at least, a full time job in a clothes store or something. 

You sure she just isn't lazy because... 

&gt; She lives with a roommate, their house is full of dust and is always very dirty. Her bed is always full of cat hair, her floor is very dirty as well and she just walks barefoot and at the end of the day goes to bed with her feet dirty as well. She doesn't wash that often too, and sometimes her smell is really intense when we are having sex l. I sleep over there at least 3 or 4 times a week.

She can't even clean when she's at home from her part time job? I just don't understand what makes you think she's depressed, is it because of the no friends thing? For all we know, she's clingy and disgusting. 

&gt; I tell her that is about time to find a better job, she tells me that she wants to open a business although she has no money, but believes that someone will invest in her idea.

PLEASE DON'T BE HER PIGGY BANK. RUN OP."
I think the fact that they text good morning and good night suggests there are deeper feelings going on already.  I would say it's worth the slight risk because there is SO much to gain. 
"I've lived in every major city in MA for at least several years at a time. I was accosted at knife point multiple times, I've heard repetitive gunshots on a regular basis, I've lived next door to murder victims and lost peers to drive bys. You NEVER get used to it. You're always at least slightly on edge. 

That said, I would never fuck with Baltimore. It's fucking nuts there. OP misled his SO because it IS dangerous there. They need to leave,  there's no way to get used to a city like that. "
"Not to steal your thunder, but I came here to tell you I'm going through the same thing. I had someone unexpectedly leave me for someone else out of the blue. It came as a shock and I am currently dealing with the fallout. I thought they were ""the one"" too.  After 7 years, they broke it off over the interwebs, no joke. Messed up thing is that I was warned by others early on that he would do this. I had to take care of many of their personal affairs as well because they are doing field work in the arctic. 

It is rough, but I know it will get better. I too lost sleep for a bit and didn't know what to do with myself.  I passed through to the other side. But I already feel more confident knowing that I'm better off than being with someone who is capable of this. In time, you will come to the same realization. Your life doesn't end, though it feels like someone rips an important piece of you away. Keep busy, talk to others. Start a hobby or pick up an old one. You get through it, it sucks, but all things pass. 

As far as the house, the roommate suggestion is a good one. Or you could rent it out while you find an apartment. Or you could rent it out to her and over charge her. Maybe she'll pay out of guilt?

"
"Don't think you have much of a leg to stand on here.  In general, for this sort of thing, you err on the side of the safer / more protective option.  You may want to go to counseling together to discuss it or even go to a family planning clinic to get more information TOGETHER and then make a decision that way.  

He doesn't feel safe, that's why he's asking for more.

Just think about it if the roles were reversed.  How would you feel about it if you wanted more BC but couldn't get it but your partner still wanted to increase the amount of activity even though you were uncomfortable?"
"Really the biggest problem with /r/relationships is that most users tend to immediately believe OP and condemn the other side. It's always black &amp; white. 

""Break up"", ""end a friendship of many years and look for new friends"" based on one post.

We are hearing her side. I find it weird, that different, unrelated groups have this opinion after many years. A big plot to go after OP? Unlikely. 

I would talk to your friends, not when they just made fun of you, but ideally when it's just you and a friend. Tell them it bothers you and that you'd like to change, but you can't because you don't see it. "
"At first I thought she was crazy, but I think the problem here is he admitted he was looking at the fully clothed pics of girls he knows for some type of sexual gratification. Which is reallly weird and would make anyone feel terrible. "
Have you considered that maybe the other friend cant make the wedding and thus is JUST going to the engagement party?
"Does it really matter who wins or loses considering you, presumably, share your finances? Is it really so hard for each of you to focus on doing your best and letting the best ""win"", considering a win on either side benefits both of you? As long as neither of you is compromising your quality of work to let the other succeed, it doesn't seem like this should be such an issue."
"No, and in the comments she says she wont because that's ""too direct"".

OP should be retitled ""I am chronically passive but resent when people can't read my mind"""
"I remember when I was 20 and thought I had everything figured out.  I was also faithful to my GF.  But you do you, guy. "
Distance yourself. Just straight up stop responding. 
Or maybe marry a woman who can't have kids and adopt?
"I don't know about passive, but it definitely sets you up for misunderstanding to text instead of say it in person. And I wouldn't stop with asking her to get her own groceries, because that's not really your issue. Your issue is her eating your food without asking as well as her not cleaning up after herself. As soon as it's more than one grievance you should talk about it in person and not over text. And when it's emotionally charged like it is, you should talk about it in person. It's too easy to misread tone over text, particularly when you're already resentful."
"Him: I've never called you stupid. I've never used that word.  
Me: It's in your tone and what your choice of words implies. Your intention is to imply I'm stupid.  
Him: That's ridiculous, you can't prove my intention.

It's more minimizing his wrong doing by trivializing my reaction. "
"&gt;Maybe I'm totally out of line with my expectations. I dunno.

You do know. Your expectations aren't out of line, but at the same time since your finances are separate, so there's a very fine line you can walk here, and her response can be anything from ""Yeah I need some help"" to ""Mind your own business"" and I think both of those responses are fair. 

I think the eating out is the first problem you can tackle. When she wants to eat out several times a week, do you pay your half? How do you split up the cooking and grocery shopping duties with each other? Is it possible that food bills could become part of what comes out of your communal fund, and you two could discuss having a set number of nights per month you eat out? "
"You follow your heart, because this is YOUR life and it will be over before you know it. Don't ever compromise when it comes to your choice of partner especially. This is your love story. You decide how it goes.

As for your folks, they'll deal with it or they won't. Let go of the idea that it's your job to please them. Whether or not they realize it, they gave you life to live it. Not for them or for anyone else, but for yourself. 

The strength of your character is such that you defied thousands of years of tradition to hold your beliefs in equality and freedom. Be proud. Be loyal to your deepest principles. There is simply no other way to live. "
"They may not give you free contraceptices (your healthcare is wildly different to ours here) but they may be able to give you advice or point you in the direction of where to find the advice.

Ultimately, I can see both sides of the coin.  Your boyfriend would NOT want you to have an abortion and therefore wants to make DOUBLY sure that you don't end up with a pregnancy.  Since your periods are irregular AF if you *were* to get accidentally pregnant, you may not know for a while as there would be no missed period.  At least he isn't refusing condoms but insisting that you go on some kind of BC - its a belt and braces approach.

From your point of view hormonal BC is not for you and an IUD is invasive in its insertion and you haven't had a pregnancy scare yet - may never have one but you never know.  

I just had a quick look on the PP website and there is a whole page that lists the different contraceptive available together with their efficacy which may be helpful for you :)

I'm still team IUD though lolol - no hormones and you REALLY cannot feel it at all.  Plus I made DF come with me when it was fitted and then (cos I had a few post fitting cramps) he fussed over me on the couch and looked after me :)"
"I can't believe you're 28. 

You allowed this person to stay with you. Your expectations on this guest are a little different than normal, but unless you communicate your expectations, you can't expect your guest to be a mind reader. I get anxiety, but this is a situation of your own making. It really sounds like you didn't want her to stay at all, so you should have said no. Maybe you should seek therapy to work on being assertive. It would empower you to deal with your issues. 

Sit her down, explain what you want to see different and if she doesn't comply, *then* you have a reason to be upset. 

But for things like sleeping on a mattress, using the internet or eating some milk and cereal? Do you expect her to bring her own towel as well? Buy some laundry detergent when she needs to do a load?"
"This still doesn't make sense in this context. She did do horrible things, we know that. Therefore she is receiving the consequences of what she did. Of course you don't need to do horrible things in order to have bad things happen to you, that's not what the poster was saying at all. Just that she did, and is having to deal with the results of her actions."
"The happy hour isn't at a bar, it's we pull a couple of dozen tables together in the cafe and everyone sits at these huge long rows of tables.

If it were an actual bar this would be less of an issue.

First, stop unclogging the John when she blows it up.

Also, try buying the cheapest, thinnest TP you can find.  In the states we have toilet paper that is labeled ""septic-safe"" and that stuff is usually thinner and breaks down more easily.  If you can find something like that the clogging problems may reduce."
You are completely right. These are the things I need to hear. I started making a list as advised to by another commenter and it's just insane seeing it layed out like that. When I needed him the most he wasn't here and that is the opposite of what marriage is about. Thank you!

"This is what you're saying: ""I want to be who I am even though I know it makes my husband's family uncomfortable. I'm incapable of changing or attempting to compromise, so they should just accept it."" That's not reasonable.

Don't expect them to accept you if you're not willing to at least compromise. "

I had a very long conversation with him after the chain incident and they assured me that they were going to make every effort to make sure that the floor was cleaned up, not only for his safety but her everyone's.

"There's some really good advice here for what you are asking, and I may be downvoted heavily for saying this, but you need to distance yourself from people like this in the future. I'm in NO WAY blaming you for what is happening, because any decent normal person would have asked before going to visit. Any decent person would have found a way to see if their feelings were returned and distanced themselves if not. This man is not normal, and there are many people out there who are like him. I say this not to spare their feelings in the future, fuck their feelings, I say this because I've had friends not realize this and I really worry for their safety. If someone has feelings for you and you don't feel the same way, move them from friend territory into acquaintance territory. This is something that a rational person would do themselves, if not, they are waiting around for you to change your mind. At best, they are not being a true friend to you. At worst you are at risk for being harassed, stalked, or assaulted. It would be nice if you could keep a friendship platonic when one person has unrequited feelings for the other, but that doesn't really ever happen."

"&gt; Well, let's just say that I'm far better off than my parents ever were and they managed to raise a good number of kids on a single income. 

This is a cop out answer. Lots of people's parents in the US raised them on one income. But that doesn't mean it's affordable today. My actual question was have you figured out how much it costs - today - to raise the number of children you want &amp; compared it to your salary? If you're the provider, then the woman that marries you under the conditions of not working &amp; having a lot of children will want assurance that you can actually financially provide. Have you verified that you're ready to do this?"

This is a pretty big deal and makes his viewpoint make a lot of sense. Condoms break ALL the time. Maybe the very fact that you haven't had an issue yet is making him nervous - like it's a ticking time bomb.

"You're overthinking it.  At worst they think you're a bad planner, but not a bad person.  

For future reference, if a place doesn't take reservations, then you need to do some more research on yelp or something.  When are the most popular times?  How long is the wait usually?  Is there something to do in the meantime?  You should also always always have a back up plan.  

I think you should wait a few weeks and try again.  This time, make you sure you pick some place you've been before (so you know the food and service is good) and somewhere that takes reservations.  Also, poke a little fun at yourself!  It will show them that you recognized the mistake and fixed it."

If it was a $50,000 SUV that she would be paying of for 10+ years...a little different. We all have childhood scars on some level but hers could run deep. Perhaps laying in bed at night she can look over at that tv(or just know she was able to buy it) just feel a little better about everything. All those times in school she got made fun of for not knowing what the cool kids were talking about regarding the popular shows? Now she showed them!..:)  

But that's just me, I'm still trying to figure out why they took happy days off the air..:)"
To be honest even if you trust your partner implicitly it's a fucking drag having someone around who you are aware is totally into your partner. I think it's probably fixable but I totally get why it's gone as its gone.

What you need to do is talk to your brother - NOT lecture him, not tell him that he shouldn't be doing this or that - just *talk* to him. Ask him about his life and his relationship, and really *listen* to him. Ask him his he feels about the stuff they're doing, if he feels ready, but don't be judgey or overbearing.

They told us to wrap it in bright tape, I don't remember what color.

We had to guard the freezer because people were driving by and would try to take it. So we duct tapped it closed and wrote ""DO NOT OPEN. DO NOT TAKE. HAZMAT CONCERN.""

Edit: I'd also like to add that most people I have known tried drugs out of curiosity and experimentation.  I think you might be overstating her fear of being accepted. Has she directly told you that's her reason for trying these things?  If she has, then that's an issue you should discuss with her."

"She should be using the money for a maid service and lawn service. If she chooses not to take care of herself by doing basic things, she can pay for it to be done for her with this new found money or your husband can go marry his mommy and be her slave forever. "
"My wife and I have 8 kids. I'm the sole breadwinner in the family, and she's a stay-at-home mom. I have a $2m policy on me. She has a $100k policy. I have an extra death benefit for my pension, so that would pay out to her as well. That would last long enough for all the kids to grow up and get out of the house without compromising anyone's lifestyle. With some good investing, the money could be extended way past that, too.

The key is to calculate how much you'll need to not have to worry about money while you're still raising the kids."
"Sounds like she was feeling vulnerable.

And she wanted to have sex to get her mind off it.

It didn't work, she wasn't into it, and you stopped.

You did absolutely nothing wrong. I want to say you even did it right. "
"ok, but you being angry is pretty reasonable...

edit: oh my god, you guys have a kid??? nothing about the way he acted is OK."
"Fuck it, all that goes out the window when you're telling your ex you wish he was me when I do nice things. I wish someone would try to get upset with me after I confronted them over this, as if I needed any more ammo to tell you to go kick rocks... "
"Seconding ufyh. I particularly like their mini-challenges -- they're quick (5-10 minutes each) and kind of addictive to do, don't feel like a big undertaking but give you that almost immediate reward feeling. "
Like a racial slur or a homophobic slur?
"therapy, dude. it exists for exactly these reasons - sometimes just to vent about feelings we have that we know we ""shouldn't"" have. sometimes to help us change our thoughts / behaviors / relationships. 

edit: ""shouldn't"" is in quotes because envy is an incredibly common human failing"
"Damn, I knew there was a name for that. "
"Um.... No. Not many of us prioritize a toy over our marriage or our partners needs and emotions. Sorry but only incredibly immature, selfish and entitled people do that"
"Do people in this sub get off on being snide and condescending at every opportunity? Because it certainly seems like it. The guy wasn't asking for dating advice, and yet you felt the need to belittle his approach."

"&gt;Why on earth do I need to explain?


It's called communication and that's what you have to do in relationships. "
"Also, this is asking OP to put a lot of work into something when it seems that the husband is not willing to reciprocate.  Until he admits that the status quo is not working and agrees to change his ways, you're leading her towards emotional burnout. 
"
"Right.  One of the weirdest things about this entire post is OP's inability to recognize those girls as being real people that made real decisions.  They were not in a threatening situation, they did it because they decided it would be fun (or whatever).  They caved on this because they wanted to, not because some 13 year old boys bullied them from through a fence.  It's offensive to the girls to act like they had no choice but to comply!"
"That's what I thought. As much as he wants the child it isn't his choice. He accepted that yet she's still asking for emotional support from him. As much as she's struggling, he is too but she's trying to make it all about her and her needs. "
"Based on his reaction that she ""can't"" have the issues she's said...I have to wonder if she knew he would react that way and chose to remove his ability to negotiate."
"I've had 3 kids this age.  Simply walking away will effect them more than any punishments mom can (won't) dream up.  At this age they crave adult attention and reassurance.  I do it with my own kids from time to time as an extreme measure when other threats/punishments aren't working.

As they get older, this doesn't work, but right now, OP is in the sweet spot."
"This really sounds like you two are incompatible.  He wants to say in So Cal near his family.  He's not going to be happy moving away.   You need to stop minimizing his desire to be around his family.  This isn't something he needs to just get over.  It's important to him.    Why don't you understand that? 

You don't like it there, so even if your health issue wasn't a consideration, you still would not be happy.  So you aren't going to compromise, either.  You're at an impasse.  

You are avoiding the inevitable: you two aren't going to both be happy in the same place.  I'm sorry.  "
"Oh god, I'm experiencing a weird hybrid justice/sympathy cringe."
"Honestly, the doctor most likely is going to tell your husband to cut  down on fatty meats and to incorporate more vegetables into his diet (along with enough cardio). Your mother isn't far off and while you're probably annoyed with her, she is giving you sound advice that most physicians would agree with. 

I think you've kind of a jerk to your mom. Her intentions were honest and you hurt her. You can apologize."
"&gt; it's going to physically and emotionally suck (for me, not you).

Why do you want/demand support from this guy when you don't offer him the same?

He wants this baby and you have said no, this is not the right time, no baby. But to him, the baby exists. There is a ""child"" that he wants to be born and you don't, and you trumped him because the ""child"" is in you. And to be fair, he did come around and agree with you that this is not the right time, because of his concern for YOU.

He cares about how you feel, I'm sure, but he also disagreed with your conclusion, and now as the termination date grows closer, that ""loss of would've-been child"" is more and more real.

This is a hard issue because as spouses you should support each other, but due to this disagreement you can't compromise on, it is kind of you vs him. I think you may just need to rely on other people. He is grieving that this ""child"" is about to die and never will be. No, he won't have any of the physical trauma or pain associated with this. But he definitely will have some emotional struggle. You're minimizing that for him, and I can see why he wouldn't want to support you when you do that.

Sucky situation, sorry."
"&gt; it's the same kind of annoyance you feel about a bad movie ending.

Holy shit that's a great call"
"Lmfao, my boyfriend and I became exclusive on our first date, the first time we met. It's not a lifetime commitment, you just don't screw other people while you're feeling things out"
Talk to her about it. Be honest with her that you noticed the text while you were texting her friends and how you're uncomfortable with it. See where the conversation goes. Not wanting your gf to be in touch with an abusive ex is a reasonable boundary to have.
"Don't invite your friend at all.  If she is dating a racist guy she condones racism.  You shouldn't have that kind of person at your wedding.

Sorry like I'm at a loss as to how you can be friends with someone who chooses to date someone you know is racist.  Especially when you're marrying someone mixed-race.  That is so incredibly disrespectful to your partner.

You're getting married.  Your partner's feelings should be your priority."
Don't forget to get tested for STDs
"&gt; I deliberately didn't tell her that because I had a feeling something was going on.

he knew"
"Probably because he ""wanted a big family"" but could give a shit about his daughter. The next question most kids will ask is ""what's wrong with me?"" "
"Well, it looks like laziness to most people. I do have seasonal depression and also work with people who are I'll: 'i can't' -'why?' -'i just can't' -'why exactly can't you? You aren't physically unable to do it.' -'its mentally overwhelming'"
"She's banking on you not mentioning it because you're young. She mentioned it that one time, to get you to look after the other kids, and now she's not bringing it up again because, let's face it, she doesn't want to pay you more.

I agree with u/-Jokar- , bring it up casually and ask who is paynig the extra money, her or the sister, and when. I'd write down the occassions you've looked after the extra children (dates, times, which children were there) and smile really sweetly and say ""I write this up for you so you wouldn't have to go through your diary"" or something to that effect.

She's being kind of shitty here. Don't feel bad about calling her out, she's most likely expecting it."
"&gt; You slipped up in a perfectly reasonable way,

I'm sorry, but refusing to complain about food that is potentially dangerous to your health as it has turned is not reasonable.  OP did not slip up, she was acting like a normal, well adjusted adult.  The server kept coming back because *she knew something was wrong.*  As someone who has worked for 8+ years in restaurants, she knew there was a problem and was getting lied to. 

OP did not do anything in the wrong here at all."
"So either OP is a racist or an asshole trying to goad people into pointless fights by just *pretending* to be a racist?

What are you even trying to argue here?

I wouldn't call someone ""blue eyed"" to provoke someone - it's not stigmatized and there's no institutionalized preference towards blue eyes in our society. Even if there was, it wouldn't be an insult if I considered it a good thing. Slurs only if you believe that the thing being insulted is negative. 

"
"What is the ""ingrained souther US"" variety of racism?  

I agree with the comments so far saying that you need to put your fiances discomfort ahead of your friends discomfort.  But I am curious as to what level of racism we are referring to.  "
"&gt; She's in a job where she's hired to be pretty, to flirt, and to make VIPs feel happy and welcome on air

You seem to have confused radio gig booker with prostitute/stripper. "
"calling someone by their first name is in no way the same as calling them by their deadname. also, ""retaliating to get a rise"" is reprehensible to begin with, moreso if you use transphobic/racist/otherwise horribly demeaning means to do it. it's not op's fault for being upset when a person has just deliberately, cruelly attacked them. idk what is up in this thread.

edited to add: op is 19. it's not a given that they have the means to just move out at will."
"I think for this specific event, it sounds like changing the venue is fine since your friends like it, you wanted to try it, and jay suggested it. There's really no harm to you to change the venue other than that ""it grinds your gears"" as you said.

But I think in general and for other invites, you don't need to always be accommodating. If Jay suggests something else, you can always just tell him that sorry you already made plans/reservations and you'll see him next time. "
That's another issue that I didn't write in the original post. There is not enough work for the people who work there now (it's a small business) so much so that Husband and I have had to find extra work to supplement our income. I have no idea how they're planning to also employ Sis and her husband. My theory is that they're trying to force husband and I to quit so that they can all work together as a big happy family without my stubborn ass messing everything up.
"You've not ruined your relationship, he has by being a shitbag, and he's strung you along for so long that you're starting to normalise shitty treatment and are thinking it's your fault. You can do better."
Honesty without tact is cruelty. The girl knows it's an issue and she was asking for EMOTIONAL support. Instead of saying 'I don't think I'm qualified to help you out' he told her to stop being lazy. 
"Man, I thought peaking in high school or college sounded bad. "
"&gt; I think his motivation was losing something he loves.

And that thing was an inanimate object rather than the love and respect of his wife. What a peach.

Btw, you may not have been nice, but he was still unemployed, and your salary was still not covering the bills. Do I want to know if he did any chores while he didn't work?"
He makes his life choices and one of them seems to lead to a position where no loans him money since they can't be sure where it really is going. He is losing people's trust with his antics.
"There is so many different types of calendars out there in world; calendar in phones, wall calendars, desk calendars, pocket calendars. Tell them to invest in one, write this kind of shit down and stop being assholes."
I don't think she knows. All I know is that he really loves the family he has now. 
"&gt;I figure that amount would buy us enough time to adjust to the change and figure out how to proceed. I personally don't believe in paying for child care, but it wouldn't be a problem since our oldest is old enough to watch and take care of things while I'm at work. 

How old is your oldest?  Do you'd expect them to give up any plans they had for their lives until the youngest is grown?

Please don't underestimate the value of the stay-at-home parent.

&gt;And I'd probably transition to working from home full-time, at least while we figure things out, if not indefinitely.

How much work do you expect to get done while watching eight children (seven if your oldest doesn't need looking after)?"
"His problems are not yours to fix. If he's not taking the steps to address these problems and instead blames you, it's time to let go."
"How is this even a question? He's your son, that's it. If she loved you, she's work with you to make him better, no make you choose. You should have dropped her the second she suggested that nonsense."
Ooooooooooh girl!!!!! I hope you contact him. Let us know how it goes 😘
"I mean if you don't feel creeped out and if this is what you want to do, then yea text him or something. If not then forget about it and trash the number."
Which love language is he expressing?  
"You have a young daughter who is watching all of this.

Do you want her to grow up thinking any one of the things your husband does to you is ok to happen to her from her father or future spouse? Do you want her to grow up thiking that her mama is ugly, stupid, and to blame for all problems and that, if she one day becomes a mama, all those things might be true about her too?

I understand leaving for yourself might seem like a daunting decision right now, especially with how battered your self esteem might be from.your husband :(. If you can't do it for you, do it for your little girl."

"Your boyfriend's friend is into you.

He said: you can do better. He meant: I am better."
"My question back to him and daughter, if she doesn't want student loans, is why doesn't she attend the school you already work at? I'm assuming your kids get free tuition there too?

If she chooses not to take advantage of that, then it's literally going to cost her. There's no reason you should have to sacrifice your career, pay and job satisfaction (that's a big deal). It's not like doing this could save her life. He's being selfish."
"Keeping power and water on to the unit at all times is likely a stipulation of your lease. Most leases include a clause like that so that tenants aren't in there damaging the unit and appliances. I don't know, to me that reads as an obligation to contribute to basic stuff like rent and utilities in order to maintain your place on the lease. You wouldn't just not pay rent for days you weren't home without making very specific agreements with the other roommate. Same should go with utilities. If you cancelled everything every time you left the house for two weeks you'd pay a small fortune in disconnect fees. "
"I would LOVE to hear her side of it, seriously. "

"Can we get a little bit more of an idea of what caused this fight?

From what you've said, it sounds like you were in the wrong and probably ought to extend an olive branch (and hopefully it's more out of regret than just loneliness!), but why did you scream at him and take off? Obviously, you should not scream at your partner as a general rule, but I think it'll be easier for us to help you if we understand a bit more of the situation.

There's a difference between screaming at a partner because you realized they're sending sexy snaps to their ex, versus, say, screaming at your partner because they found YOU doing that, you know? Was this a big issue, or did you lose your temper over something small? Do you often lose your cool like this?"
How is telling OP his brother is a stupid layabout who deserves to be poor giving helpful advice? 
"&gt;I know now where she stands about this situation and my attempts to maturely talk about things afterwards were not well received.

This is all that matters. 

Now move on, go reinvent yourself and rebuild your self-esteem and confidence for the next more compatible woman who will enter into your life one day.

Go CREATE your happiness.

My condolences regarding your father :( Go heal."
"This racism is usually in the form of microagressions. Nothing with virulent intent (I hate n*s and I wish they would die) but rather passive (sometimes unintentional) putdowns that will definitely rub people the wrong way. 

For example, I was the only black kid in my social group growing up. My whole life I've always been a good student, so they'd sometimes tell me ""SpikeLeeIsMyDad, you're so smart for a black person!"" Was that meant to put me down? Probably not. Can it be seen as offensive? Most definitely. "
"&gt; Not to be a downer, but you could die tomorrow.

You're not a downer my friend, I absolutely know that I am living a borrowed time and I can die any moment from now 'till December. I almost feel like not going. If my family can't be with me, I don't want to go. "
Edit: ignore I was thinking community property which is different 
"iirc my wife told me that first Michelle slapped her sister for calling her a whore and then she slapped her back. That's the only physical confrontation they had. But you're absolutely right, physical abuse is a bitch (I should know, my old man used to hit hard) and it is definitely a deal breaker. I know that I maybe am asking too much of them and that it's possible they will never speak to one another. 

But I also feel pain when they deny me the opportunity to spend perhaps the last moment I can have with them. With my family as a whole. It sucks man, it really does. "
"To me it sounds like she's going through depression or the two of you are just not compatible and it took her until after the wedding to realize it

&gt; we've been sexless for over a year now. And I can count the number of times we've had sex since the end of our honeymoon on one hand.

"
"What people really mean by ""Let's be friends!"" is ""let's be *friendly*""

You've got a range of friends in your life.  There's best friends, there's school friends, there's social media friends, and there's people who you can sustain a five minute conversation with once a year.

Slot your ex-boyfriend into one of those lower slots.  If he texts, take your sweet time to respond.  Don't go out of your way to see or talk to him in a social way.

Ideally, you should go no contact for a while and slowly work him back to ""friendish acquaintance"" when you can handle it.  Don't feel handcuffed by the ""let's be friends"" goal.  It's just that: a goal.  If keeping him around is too painful in any capacity, just drop him like a hot potato."
"&gt;What should I do about this in the future  

Find someone who doesn't care about your past sexual history, i know if you told me that, i would care less who you had been with, and would be more interested in the relationship at hand."
"I don't want to sound too judge-y of the dynamics of your marriage, but if you both are causally floating divorce as an option in day-to-day arguments, I'd say that's a red flag for your future. I couldn't imagine being in a relationship where my S/O threatened divorce when presented with the task of being an equal partner. I obviously don't know all the details, but it seems as if your wife has no intention of going back to work. Plenty of people work jobs that aren't their ""calling"" simply because they need an income to stay afloat (99% of the population haha), so if that's her only excuse for not working, I'd call BS. Providing for her family should be paramount - if that means having an income to help pay off bills and set aside money for the future, then so be it. You have every right to expect this from your life partner. "
We had a sofa bed for when people came over to stay 
"Get a new boyfriend, this one is useless and broken"
"This is a huge enormous thing you are asking of him, and you don't seem to realize it.

You are perfectly justified in not wanting to live a life of pain and suffering.   I've never understood the objections to medical suicide.  You'd do it if your dog was in pain, why not show people the same courtesy?

But he's also allowed to see this as a dealbreaker.  I'd probably feel the same way myself.

What you are asking him to do is invest the next 19 years into a relationship with a hard exit date.  You're explicitly saying that you'll abandon him.

In his mind, he has two options.  He can stay with you, and deal with the inevitable heartbreak, and then try to put his life back together, and maybe find someone else to share the rest of his life with.

Or he can bail now, while he's still young, and find someone else that will stick around.

I get that you think that the years you will have together will be good.  And they probably will.  But so will any years that he spends with someone else, with the additional benefit of even more years, plus someone to grow old with, and maybe even kids.

Let him go.

Sabotage is the word I was thinking but couldn't place. It's like a mixture of that and one-upping.
"You offered your girlfriend a place to stay.  This isn't a ""let's move in and join our lives together""  arrangement.  This is a ""you're about to homeless,  need a place to stay?""  situation.

"ehh......not that this guy seems like a good person, but I sometimes joke about slapping people. I never do, of course, but if a friend says/does something stupid I often say ""Boy, I'm'a slap you back to where you came from"" or ""into next week"" or ""so hard it'll make your ancestors dizzy"" (gotta love Mulan).

"If you're concerned about your coworkers' reaction to you being gone for so long and having to pick up your slack, I would recommend that you send the people covering for you some kind of gift, like a nice basket of treats or have good coffee delivered to them on Monday mornings.

"I suggest not meeting at all.

* ""I don't feel like it's a good idea to meet up.""

* ""I don't think we have anything to talk about, so I have to decline.""

"Ugh the ""why can't you be happy for me"" shit is something my ex did all the time. Don't listen to it. You're allowed to be upset by this and honestly it seems like you aren't a priority for this guy, and you should treat him accordingly (dump him and go on awesome world travels with friends)"
It is indeed a public machine! Someone else mentioned this as well - definitely a possibility. Thank you!
"If it helps you feel better I also forget stuff all the time!! I once bought a pair of underwear with a bra, wore them once and totally forgot about them then 3 months later found the bra underneath my boyfriends bed and freaked out until he pointed out it was mine hahaha. It does happen! It's likely a houseguest's that he's cleaned up or as you said it could even be yours! "
"I think it's alright to feel turned off and not want to get it on.  This is a tough one, kind of similar to the diaper fetish situation that was mentioned on this subreddit, maybe you can find some answers there.   The girl who discovered his man's diaper fetish lost all attraction towards him and she felt almost disgusted to even touch him.  The recent discovered knowledge of his fetish totally changed the girl's perspective of him.

I have a feeling you're kind of feeling the same way.  That learning this whole new thing about your bf has changed your perspective of him.  I guess at the end of the day the question boils down to, can you accept him for who he is?  Good luck!"
It sounds like your fiance isn't really interested in a relationship with you. How the hell do you two plan on getting married and living together if he doesn't even want to talk to you daily? Move on.
"I know, that's my fear ): "

"re the edit - it really sounds like he's checked out of this marriage. He won't give you support, he expects things of you but doesn't want to give back or even look after himself. His suggestion just sounds like a roommate situation. Are you getting anything out of this relationship? You should try counselling both by yourself and as a couple (I'll bet money he won't agree to go but definitely go by yourself. So you at least have some support during your weight loss if nothing else.)"
He's lived with his mom his entire life and she cooks and takes care of him. I guess he would miss that.

Sounds manipulative and like you're just playing games. Suggesting you step back and take some time right as you're moving in together is a giant red flag for any woman.

Well ... yes. That's what we do in relationships. But if she wants out, she wants out and you should let her.

That's not for you to decide. Again, if she needs the space and doesn't want to be in this relationship any longer, you can't force her to stay. "

I'd add that explaining these feelings to your father and mother might be helpful too 
"You gave up on your marriage when you broke your marriage vows the first time, lied about it, and then continued to put the other woman on a pedestal. 

I mean, what would you have done if your wife cheated on you, lied to you for years, and then spent that same time she was lying to you trying to comfort other men because they got involved with a married woman? "
"Exactly what this poster said. You need to determine if you have a husband problem in addition to a MIL problem. Ultimately, your husband is the one that has to deal with this. You two have to be a united front but if your husband isn't 110% on board and in charge of this than you are the evil woman who is controlling and manipulating her baby boy. Based on your responses to other issues in this thread (lawn mowing, etc) it appears that your MIL is really manipulating this situation. "
"Because I don't leverage my  power in a relationship by withholding money. Especially not over a very sensitive matter.

Very good point about manipulation.

"I can totally understand feeling heartbroken. It's completely natural and expected escpically if you always wanted your own children. 
 
I am in a similar position to you. I can not have children due to mental illness and my partners family has a strong family history of autism, mental illness and intellectual impairment. It took some time to process and I still get sad about it sometimes. 

It is something to discuss with a genetic counsellor and with your psychiatrist. Other people are suggesting using a donor egg. If you do choose this make sure your doctor is there every step of the way. Pregnancy and IVF can trigger psychosis or make symptoms worse. You may also need to change medications because of risks during pregnancy. After pregnancy you will also need to be monitored by your doctor because the risk of post natal psychosis will be higher. Also consider sleep deprivation and the impact on your mental health. 

I have personally chosen not to have children myself (egg donor etc) the impact of hormones on me is too much. I will foster or adopt. This was not an easy decision and I think you and your husband need all the facts before making yours and making sure all the supports are in place.  "
"Set a spending limit for independent purchases for each of you per month. Anything else, it has to be a co-decision. if someone asks to borrow money all she has to say is I'm sorry we're on a strict budget and any decisions would have to be a co-decision with my husband. She can use that line all of the time. It will help you plan your future and set sound financial goals. Don't treat her like a child. The rules are the same for you. Sit down together and go over your budget and terms for expenses. If you had a plan in place, you can avoid this. Perhaps a household account and seperate accounts for each of you with a monthly stipends deposited into each. Apologize for your lack of respect comment. It adds to the issues. She is looking for validation and acceptance which she will never get from those that use her kind heart for their gain. Only false attention that I'm sure she is aware of. Is she the type that would give her last cent to take care of others? Probably. She's a people pleaser to the point of her own detriment. The one that isn't being pleased is herself. She's not as happy as you think she is. She's aware of what she's doing but can't help it.  It's something that probably started in her youth and is difficult to shake. Loving guidance is the key. She's got a good heart and good intentions. Cherish that. Work on assertive responses to those that take advantage of her. "

What's the childish part? Wanting to have fun? Wanting to spend time with loved ones? Wanting an excuse to celebrate?

There's nothing inherently childish here. 

It reminds me of people who call videogames childish. "
"OP you may need to reframe your issue:

My rapist boyfriend is a control freak and constantly changes the goalposts to keep me in a state of anxiety. 

How can I keep him happy bearing in mind he has decided that my happiness means nothing to him?"
"That's not really what's he's saying. The chance alone is what's he's concerned about, which 100% exists in this case, regardless of how small the chance of actually passing it on may be. "
"Are you sure this is a 3 year relationship you are talking about? You make it sound like you got into a relationship a few weeks ago and you are too insecure to ask her about anything.

May there be a specific reason why she posts pictures of others but not you?

"
She probably had a knot in her ponytail she needed to remove...
"&gt; Did he not speak to your friend as well? I don't understand why it would be your responsibility to pass that message on to the friend.

The guy is avoiding the woman because she's creepy and hell-bent on seducing him. I don't blame him. You don't get rid of an attention seeker by giving them attention."
"Feeling ""I love him but we have a lot of painful problems and they're all my fault"" is what an abusive relationship feels like. No one would stay with an abuser if they didn't feel like they were loved."
"What the fuck? This is one of the most selfish things I've ever read in my life. I hope this is a troll. Having kids is not about YOU. It's about the CHILDREN. I'm pretty fucking sure no child wants to have a disease or disorder. If my mother had passed down some bad medical condition to me, KNOWING IT WOULD HAPPEN, just because she wanted kids, I would resent her for the rest of my life. 

You are literally saying children's feelings, opinions and happiness does not matter as long as YOU are happy. The kid is a HUMAN BEING. A PERSON. Not some accessory or toy or pet. I hope you never fucking have kids with that attitude.

Having a child who YOU KNOW 100% has a good percentage of being/will be badly disabled/in chronic pain/have terrible lifelong health problems just because you want the gratification of having a child, is EXTREMELY selfish IMO."
"I don't think you're selfish, but I would strongly recommend trying some couples counselling before calling it quits. "
That definitely could have happened - he spent several days last week thoroughly cleaning the apartment and it could have come from anywhere. 
"&gt; Like how could I judge something so wrong


I know it is absolutely the human condition to put ourselves in the forefront of any interaction, so I mean this kindly, but - you're always going to run into trouble if your first assumption is that it's all about you.


You did not misjudge the situation. If it is described accurately, there was nothing there for you to misjudge. Things seemed one way, and there was no way for you to know that it was actually another. So I honestly think that in this case, it has nothing to do with you at all.


&gt;what was motivation to give me a fake number.


I also think you really need to let go of wanting this information, as hard as it may be. I totally understand why you want it, but if we're going with the assumption above (that it had nothing to do with you) than the likely assumption that follows is her motivation is based on some kind of personal issue. Maybe insecurity, maybe a desire to avoid perceived confrontation, maybe flakiness, who knows?


But the point is, that since it's a personal thing that drove her to do what she did, you should not ask for any type of explanation. The chances of getting an honest one are slim to none, anyways - if she gave you a fake number because she's scared of saying no, do you really think she'll somehow have the confidence to admit to that?


Not to mention, if she did give you a fake number, I think that's a pretty clear sign she's sending you that she doesn't want to interact. So you ignoring that sign by asking her to interact with you - by asking her to explain herself - is going to be really off-putting. Yes, giving someone a fake number is shitty. Ignoring that sign and pursuing contact with someone who doesn't want it is also shitty. 


Finally, it's wrong to ask why in a more general sense because you should always be working to resolve these types of things within yourself. You need for closure has nothing to do with her - is has to do with your own insecurities and your own self-doubt. She can't help you with those things.

"I remember a psychiatrist told me that the way our genetic make up is created is imagine DNA from three generations on both parents sides are thrown into a bucket. Then take a stick with glue on it and stick it in the bucket and swirl it around. What you pull out on your stick is how your genetic makeup was determined.

Seeing a genetic counselor will definitely help with understanding what your kid could get.

On a side note, I suffer from a slew of mental illness, most prominent is Bipolar, and I'm afraid to have kids because I don't know what I'll pass down to them. So I understand your husband's reservations."
"I'm also just so curious?? What could they possibly be moving in a bedroom that takes 10-20 minutes, twice a day?? 

It currently sounds like she's dropping a bunch of bowling balls or something on the floor that are now rolling around and knocking into other parts of the furniture. Is it rude to ask what it is? Like what could possibly entice someone to want to spend 40 minutes a day moving bedroom furniture??"
"Why exactly are they unwilling to travel together? Have you told them that this is one of your last dying wishes? Dude, you're dying. It's ok to be selfish in the last few months of your life. "
Damn man - she's got to go! Like yesterday
You are obviously not married.  I couldn't live a day without her.  I'm asking for advice not sympathy.  
"First things first--pictures of pregnancy tests can be faked. If you can get a hold of it or if he still has it, try doing a reverse image search.

Second thing--pregnancy tests can be faked. There is, for some bizarre reason, a market of positive pregnancy tests. People sell them to women who are trying to lock down a dude or just play a prank.

Third thing--the fact that she backed out on Planned Parenthood and its extremely thorough care is definitely a brow-raiser.

Fourth thing--he needs to not be alone with her in private EVER."
"It sounds like you're trying to monopolize his time and expect him to see you whenever you're not working. That's in addition to being an emotionally overwhelming person (maybe an emotional vampire) and blowing things out of proportion. If you say during the week, ""lets hang out Saturday afternoon for date day"" and he says 'yes' then he needs to hold that commitment. If you keep hinting you're free Saturday afternoon and he says he cant commit to be there, then you need to make other plans and not assume he's going to fold to your will. Also it sounds like he's a really good guy trying to help out his uncles and take care of his mom (he also lives there sometimes so it makes sense he wants to pay her back a bit and make his living area livable). Finally if I had a huge (unnecessary) fight with my girlfriend but ended up finishing chores or work earlier than I thought I probably wouldn't be rushing over to her place to continue it either. I would do what he did, go burn off some steam and chill with a friend or something to take my mind off it or whatever rather than seeing you and fighting for 5 hours because ""this needs to be talked over"" because you're too emotionally fragile to let him process. You sound like you only see things from your own perspective"
"Yeah, she knew it was coming up and she knows from memory what day it's on. She must have just forgot."
"Homeless? When did I ever mention her leaving permanently? I said to get out of the house, not *move* out."
"Sure. And I'm sure that those stats don't take into account the average income of the household the kid is born into, or they neighborhood they live in or the schools they go to.  
Single parenthood isn't a badge or a brand.  It is what you make of it.  OP wants a kid and has the financial means to have one.  That's probably better than the majority of two parent homes.  "
"In their defence, it *is* timeless advice "
"&gt; I am dying and instead of enjoying my last remaining moments on this planet, my own daughters are rejecting me.

Just to be clear on this point, they're not rejecting *you.* I know it feels that way, but it's not what's happening. They're rejecting a relationship with one another and being forced to be together. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with this, OP. 

I hope that you get to Japan and whichever kids (hopefully all!) are enthusiastic about being there with you."
"Are there any other areas of your lives together where he displays a clear and utter disregard for your feelings? I used to date someone who liked to ""troll"" me, in his words. This consisted of him lying to me for a short period of time in order to induce a reaction. Then he would say he was *""just kidding""*. 

At the end of the day it's pure disrespect and I bet this isn't the only way he shows it."
":( OP, you deserve a partner who is chomping at the bit to wife you up, not constantly changing the goal posts. "
"She gave you the easy answer.

Then gave you the hard answer.

The next answer will be the ""I already found the person who treats me the way I want to be treated""."
"I don't know how her parents are, so I'm not going to push too strongly for this, but hear me out for a second...

You know how you immediately saw this as a bad situation that she shouldn't be involved in?  And how she didn't?  That in itself is a huge problem.  This guy is bad news, but he's ultimately a symptom of whatever she's got going on that makes her want/enjoy this kind of relationship.  Some of this is just her being young, but there are other things going on with her that contributed.  And those other things can be helped and resolved.  Even if they stop communicating tomorrow, she still needs to address her issues and if her parents are the type to want to help, she's already past the point where they'd be worried.  

She might move past this on her own, but there's no reason that she needs to.  There are people out there that can support and aid her.  The longer she's able to hide these problems, the harder they will be to work through down the road.  

It's a lot for you to deal with, and it's understandable if you just don't want to get involved, but even if it costs you the friendship, you'd be doing the morally right thing to let an trusted adult know what's going on.

"If you have a good relationship with your landlady, why not try to talk to her about it? Bring her some cookies and chat with her and honestly express your concerns about the animal to her. Ask if there's anything you can do to help, since you have a background in working with dogs."
"You need to stop being offended and listen to what people are telling you, guy.

You could lose your wife over this and it won't be some other guy's fault. It will be yours. You're treating her like shit when she's already being treated like shit by the rich assholes at her work that treat her like a party favor.

You want to be different from them? Treat her like your WIFE with dignity and respect and support. She's a person, dude. An actual and whole human being. "
"This sounds like a pretty extreme fetish. You aren't required to accommodate it, and your partner wouldn't be very supportive if they didn't respect your wishes to not be apart of it, but if he doesn't, it's a really good reason to end the relationship. 

Can you have a conversation with him to see how he can explore and experience his fetish in a way that does not include you? To take from one of your posts below, you don't have to deny his fetish, he just needs to accept you not participating. "
I think you're the only one that didn't understand it lol 
"I find jealousy an interesting concept in relationships. OP feels her boyfriend is giving ""boyfriend favors” to women other than her. What defines a boyfriend favour? It's the concept that as his girlfriend, she's entitled to certain treatment - and she is. If he didn't pick HER up from the airport, but picked up G, that would be problematic.

""I do not like the idea of him being alone in a car with an attractive, young girl""

This is when jealousy becomes unreasonable. You can't tell someone who they can or can't hang out with, even if you may feel threatened by this other girl.

OP, if your boyfriend hasn't actually done anything with these girls, then you really shouldn't worry. He was a serial monogamist, considering he had two long term relationships, and even though they ended, with children, you say he's a good father. 

You need to find some security and come to a point where you trust your boyfriend, otherwise your jealousy will grow, turn even more controlling which will push him away. It sounds like this girl is just his friend - imagine if it was a guy friend asking for these favours. Would it be fine for him to do these things? Not every girl is after your boyfriend. I think it's alright to communicate to your boyfriend that you feel a little threatened, but not in a snooping, accusatory way. "
"Seriously? You believe him why? When you confronted him he lied. He screwed three hookers in five days.... only stopped (for now), because you caught him."
"Wow.... You owe him a huge apology. It's normal to tell your spouse where you are and when you will be home. It's also normal to mention who you're with. By disappearing overnight, you must have really worried him. 

Adults don't just disappear like that and sleep over with their exes while drunk. Not ones who want to stay married anyway. 

Start apologizing and good luck repairing this. Step one is realizing what you did wrong and how completely out of line you were. "
"A similar thing happened with my dog. My brother forgot that a section of the backyard fence was taken down for repairs by the home owner association and let my dog out to pee like always after work. My dog escaped and was struck by a car that day.

It was technically his fault, yes. But whats the point of blaming him? It won't make me feel better about my dog dieing.  It would only make my brother feel worse. 

The reality of the situation is that when something like this happens it sucks for everyone involved. If it were me. I wouldn't confront your roomate about not being ""remorseful."" "
"Hah. I've been taking various doses of citalopram for nearly 10 years. It doesn't make you do that at all.

Lol watch how quickly he gets dropped when you two have kids. Happy couple + grandbabies &gt; racist son with no manners. I'd worry less about him.

"That's excellent advice ! OP could also search for people who work in video games/3D/VFX/etc. It's my job and my friends from school are nerdy (obviously) and not sexist at all. I find that there's a big difference between gamers and people who work in the industry (but there are of course idiots and assholes everywhere). In my city there's a local bar where artists gather once a month, I have never been able to go but it'd be a good place to make friends with similar interests."

"Nah. It's fine. He'd tell you. Most condoms are same as nothing, especially if they actually fit."
Rest in peace Nala. She sounded like she was a great companion. 
"&gt;she's only responding with threats of breaking up and insults. I don't know how to handle this.

  She's being verbally abusive and manipulative.  I think you need to strongly consider breaking up.  This is not a healthy situation."

You could definitely find a room for rent that is cheaper than $1200/month. Move out.
"&gt;I thought I could just put this behind me and be the best boyfriend **that my girlfriend deserves**.

Your girlfriend deserves the truth, not to be tricked into a marriage with a cheater. It's going to be a lot messier to deal with this when she finds out if you're already married. Tell her now and accept the fallout rather than trying to sneak it past her and getting a way worse one years down the line that involves a divorce (in which you are 100% at fault and will *not* win)."
"I'd imagine he's just not attracted to her, as attraction hasn't been mentioned at all, just he keeps saying he ""doesn't have those feelings for her"".

Reading between the lines, he simply isn't physically attracted to her, but he knows not to say that on here because he'd get eviscerated."
"Yes, really what is so bad about it? How is doing 1 line of cocaine worse than doing shots until you black out? Do you even know what moderation is? Moderation is essentially what defines the relationship between human and drug. Without moderation anything can be bad for you. And anyone who displays a healthy amount of moderation has no need to justify how they choose to spend their free time to people like you."
"I grew up online, and I feel your pain. I was online back in the mid-90s when ""girl=guy in real life,"" and I grew thick enough skin to deal with blatant sexism when I was younger. But these days I don't put up with bullshit for a minute. 

I met my husband in WoW over 8 years ago. At first I thought he was another dudebro gamer, but he turned out to be the most awesome, wonderful, loving, caring, compassionate, genuine, dependable, and equal-minded person I've ever known.

There are great people out there. You have to filter and filter hard. Also work on yourself and become the best version of yourself you can be. Meet people organically, via your hobbies, friends, social groups and acquaintances. 

Finally I suggest dropping the whole ""nerd"" identity and not look for other ""nerds."" The term is so overused these days with everybody online and into things that used to be ""nerdy."" It's all pretty mainstream now, comic books, star wars, swords and high fantasy, gaming, computers, tech... Don't worry about nerdy people. Look for great people. "
"She didn't say it was his fault.  She did what she had to do because she's been struggling with this for *years*.  

It's painful to be around someone you love and can't have.  She's doing what's best for her, because eventually it becomes completely unhealthy.  Staying in this friendship at her own detriment just to avoid hurting OP's feelings would be stupid.  

If he spoke up and said, ""I love you too, let's be together,"" I'm sure she wouldn't have minded him saying anything.  But she sensed that wouldn't be the case and she requested that he stay silent because she knew she was putting him in a hugely complicated, emotional, and uncomfortable position.  She didn't want him put on the spot and having to stammer out an awkward-but-polite rejection.  

She's doing all this in the interest of self preservation, she isn't blaming him for her feelings.  "
"I'm a lot like you and didn't care about having a big wedding based on other people's expectations.  As a compromise, we had a small ceremony with only parents and siblings.  No wedding party, no bridal shower, no big white dress (I wore emerald green), no flowers.  It was amazing and I'm so glad we didn't give in to the pressure to have a big wedding just to please everyone else (and not ourselves).  If you felt really bad, you could always have a party/cookout/get together to celebrate with extended family later.  Good luck!"
"He made it known early on he didn't want kids and yet you persisted. Did you think he'd have a change of heart and go ""oh hey being a dad is great after all?""
No. What he wants out of life kids get in the way of.
End stop.

Find you someone else with compatible values who will live your son as their own!"
"This times a million. I grew up EXTREMELY POOR and have been able to dig myself out little by little at the age of 27 by going to college and getting a decent job. Who are you to pass judgement if you don't understand what it's like to grow up poor? Sometimes marriages with people from different economic backgrounds are a disaster in the making because they don't speak the same language and cannot understand each other. Her family comes before you. Don't expect her to stop helping them out because it bothers you. Plus, if you really make that much money it doesn't sound like you are really in need of her income, so what's the problem here? "
Then you know they're an asshole and you dodged a bullet. 
"It's not that I don't understand his interest. I just literally have nothing to offer him in that regard and we've established this multiple times and don't know what I'm supposed to do. He's the one who calls it an obsession and is frustrated over it.   


I seem to be coming off very weird in multiple comments so I'll take the L and admit I'm not great about speaking emotionally to strangers and I have my own issues with dads so that might be bleeding through more than I think in this post. Like, this is not how I speak to him when he's looking for support or anything. I get this is a big deal, I took those follow up conversations seriously and really did try to help my boyfriend figure out how to bridge that gap. "
"Short of actual abuse, which I don't think this meets the bar for, it's not really an outsider's place to interfere in other people's parenting. 

I think one of the best things you can do for Jason is to be a supportive presence in his life. Tell him he's a great person even on days when he's not rated ""100"", and be the one who gives him hugs if his parents are standoffish.

Kids recognize and appreciate consistent love and support no matter where it comes from. "

"Notice that the issue is not even related to the fellow anymore. She didn't want to say she had a boyfriend, she overreacts (""I'll delete him!"") even if you haven't said anything to that extent, and she has even lied to him with no need whatsoever.

You are not a dirty secret. You deserve the respect and the trust you have given her, and if she doesn't see it that way you're better off having her move away for good from your life."
"8.5 years is a long ass time. People change. If you wanna go trippy, think of this, not one molecule in her body was there 8.5 years ago. She is a different person. Literally. "
"No, not at all. He doesn't accuse me of flirting or anything along those lines so it's really out of the blue for him to assume I'm cheating straight away."
I've seen this all too many times. Forgo the financial contribution by your in-laws and set a reasonable budget yourself and do things the way you want. Set a time in the future in which you will have the resources and cut her out of the plans. She dos not need to be involved.
"Obviously you don't, jesus christ."
Let's hope this kid's life ambition isn't to be a baseball player ;)
"I wouldn't trust what the aunt who seems clearly abusive allows her to do or not as a metric of her ability. Also physical issues could prevent her from safely cooking, it doesn't say much about her level of cognitive ability. 

'Mental age' is a damaging concept for disabled people. We don't have the 'mental age' of a non disabled child, we have our real age as disabled adults. 

Her aunt is calling her a burden, yelling at her and making her cry. This is emotional abuse. There is nothing wrong with her needing a high level of help and accomodations and a legal guardian, but she's still a human being who deserves dignity and autonomy.

Treating her as a child because of her disability and taking her way of communicating with other people away is not right. 

What level of cognitive ability do you need to be allowed to date? I Basically can't do basic math or read a lot of academic language, and my motor skills are rubbish. Do I make the cut? Where do you draw the line? 

Non disabled people make fucking awful choices and have their reasoning clearly impaired when it comes to dating very often, but we still recognise it's their life and they are allowed to make their own mistakes. Just how disabled do I need to be until it's ok to take that freedom away? 

The aunt is clearly restricting her freedom and mistreating her and honestly it's so awful how many people will excuse the abuse of disabled people because they need a caregiver. "
"Is the aunt taking away her method.of communication or backing her up after she told OP no...
"
Lol I'm sure the phone accidentally did it. Lmao!!
"OP, to be blunt, this is too much work for someone you know is an abuser.  And apparently he has other issues.  You really think he won't relapse on the substance abuse?  You really think he won't relapse on the abuse?

OP, you are exulting in the feeling you got closure, that you won the argument with you ex.  This is a dangerous delusion that people are rational beings who can read a book and instantly decide to reform themselves.  Are you aware that manipulators are perfectly capable of saying whatever they have to say to worm their way back into your life?

OP, you need to ask yourself if you are so strong, if you are so aware, why haven't you taken the chance to get a restraining order against a known abuser with domestic violence charges and get on with your life without this man.

You haven't yet shown the ability to cut one abuser out of your life.  Think about it."
"Seriously. A mother of three has certain priorities. 

Please leave her in peace to think and process things, OP. Otherwise you will drive her away."
"I'd tell her. You'll likely lose her as a friend (the ol' shot messenger problem), but you'll be doing her a solid. "
Ya I wouldn't get married to someone if you describe them as lacking respect for you. 
You honestly can't see a difference between how children see horror movies designed to scare people and their mom's tattoo?!?!?!? REALLY?!?!?!?
"If she's still posting photos of you and thinking about you, chances are she'd love to be back in touch, but reaching out to a minor to whom you aren't blood related can be potentially a really bad idea - for all she knows, your mom has been spewing poison in your ear (which she has) and you've now turned against her (you haven't, but she doesn't know that). If you told your mom she'd been in touch, your mom might get the police involved or something, which could affect her other children - from her perspective, as long as you're under 18, it's a high risk/low reward proposition. 

If you reach out to her and explain what you've just told us, that you miss her but are afraid of damaging your relationship with your mom, she'll understand. You're a young adult, but compared to a 40yo, you're a kid. It's her job as the adult to be understanding. Tell her you'd like to start some sort of communication between you two (the starting an alternate fb account is a good idea someone already suggested - use your name, but with no photo and just add her account, and once she's added you, send her a PM with your phone number explaining all this, then delete the new account and save her number under a fake name), and then once you've left home and your mom can't keep tabs on you, start a relationship with her properly, with visits and the like. 

When you feel the time is right, I'd suggest writing a letter to your mom and brother telling them the situation - gives them time to process it, and you can have a real conversation afterwards, rather than angry words being exchanged in the heat of the moment. Your mother is an adult - she shouldn't force you to choose, and if she does, she's  the one behaving badly, not you. It's not your fault how the adults in your life treated each other. Your family is the people you love the most. They don't have to be the ones you share chromosomes with. "
"To be fair you use pretty mild language in the post but your examples in the comments are pretty graphic. A quick playful boob grab behind the kid's back is one thing, shoving fingers inside you is like 500% different. That's why most comments here are encouraging you to try and compromise for the sake of your relationship, whereas if you had included some of the more graphic details up top I don't think you'd get that. I know my advice would have been different.

Balancing a sex life and keeping the romance alive after kids is tough for all new parents. There's got to be lots of articles and stuff about it. Maybe you guys should read them together if you want to balance everything out."
"I agree I wouldn't let my SO peek at my vag, or suck on my nipples with my child in the same room. I'm sorry, your initial OP made it sound like much more innocent sexual affection. 

In these cases, I have to agree with you. "
Because she's a  weirdo that called all of his friends like a helicopter parent 
"Yeah, tattling on him to mom and dad is pretty weird, especially seeing as she's 27."
This is quite a leap
"It reads like they're cheating off each other, which... seriously? These kind of classes can be so, so stressful but that's no excuse to demand somebody you care about fails. "
"lmao why is it her job to put his shit away? If he wants something to be easy to find, he should put it somewhere he knows it's gonna be, or help clean up/organize more often. "
"How are her feelings shitty? Because she wants her guy to be into women? She does NOT have shitty feelings just because she is concerned. It's important to be in a legitimate relationship with someone who is legitimately attracted to your gender. Unfortunately, we're in a world where gay people are sometimes unaccepted and it's occasionally necessary to worry whether someone might be suppressing their true needs. Better to confront the issue straight on. "
I think everyone might be misreading OP and she means the actual litter gets thrown out and replaced with fresh litter once a week?  I feel like the cats would *really* let you know if the litter box was only getting scooped once a week.
"I understand this is a vent and I'm sure it feels good to have gotten it out of your system to the internet world. I have been in a similarly difficult situation. I was broken when he got ""better,"" but I could never view him the same way after how he treated me from before, despite the circumstances. He never took any responsibility for how damaged I was, in fact I don't think he hardly even thought about the emotional impact his abuse had on me.

I left and did my best to not look back. My self confidence and stability is slowly but surely building back up. I'm currently with an amazing human being who does nothing but support me.

The important thing is to not rely on someone else to ""fix"" you, and do not expect to fix others. The old saying ""you cannot help someone else until they want to be helped"" is essential here. I say this because I did not have an expectation of my new lover making everything right with me emotionally. I understand your boyfriend has already been helped, however the scars are still there and it is very, very difficult to just forget the negative past between you two. If you're still hurting then you should think about where your future with this person stands, and if it's worth continuing to be hurt and damaged by memories with this person, or accept that you will need to move on to create new memories in a new life."
Plot twist: this is actually the boyfriend jerking it as he writes out this elaborate and wildly unbelievable fantasy in which his girlfriend loves secretly watching him jack off.
"I'm a software developer that works 8-10 hours a day on  much less flexible hours and I still contribute 50% as much at home. My dad used to work 16 hours a day as on construction, came home beat up and still spent time with us. Don't let your husband use what he does as some excuse for why he needs that much rest or free time."
"What two whole boxes? Dude, we can only go by the story *you wrote.* In your OP, you have a drunken memory of maybe touching more condoms, and based on that memory you start digging through your girlfriend's drawers and photographing her shit. If there's a whole other box of missing condoms, well then that's a lot more suspicious but there's no way for us to magically know that, since you didn't write it. Based on the story you told, you confronted your girlfriend with photographic evidence of her drawers based on nothing more than thinking you felt other wrappers while you were drunk.

"You're sick in the head. Who leads an innocent woman on saying he loves her and wants a family with her WHILE HIS WIFE RAISES HIS TWO CHILDREN? You HAD a family! You HAD a wife who loved you! I hope your wife meets a man who is worthy of her because you sure as hell aren't.
I'm not usually *disgusted* with posters here but I pray I never marry a man like you. Foul."
"Okay, go to counseling to figure out why you thought violating him was fine for so long, and why you still want to. "
"I like that you took the responses on board and looked to see if perhaps there was an issue on your side.

Some people are saying you weren't a mind reader to know she was scared but I think that's missing the point. I think many people would have reacted the way the woman did and not mean any harm to you or your pet (although I accept she could have been nicer about it). 

One thing you could also look at is recognising that just because you like/are comfortable with something, doesn't mean others will feel the same way and just to approach new people/situations with that in mind. That way, hopefully, you won't take it personally - she was rude but I think it was instinctive rather than specific to you and your pet."
Girl you shouldn't feel bad about being divorced twice. It was not your fault at all. You should be very happy and proud that you don't stick around and let men treat you like trash. Do your thing girl! Take care of yourself and live happily. You don't need that crap in your life. 
"He knows. I haven't said anything to him. He was at a softball game, I just called him out of the dugout, handed him my wedding ring, and told him I was done. I haven't spoken to him since. We're at home right now, he's on the couch. Like I said, two kids, have to put them to bed in their home, in their own beds. He knows that I'm done. It's just these emotions right now. I am trying to stop blaming myself, stop trying to find some failure of mine. I know in my rational brain that it's not me at all. But that's a hard thing to turn off when you feel this low. I'm going to be divorced twice by the time I'm 30.....That's also hard for me to swallow. "
"I'm getting married in October. Because of our work schedules and the fact that I have eczema on my hands, my fiancé does all the laundry and dishes. I never asked him to do these things, he took it upon himself to. But when I do ask him for things, or when he asks me (take out garbage, empty drain tray, tidy, clean the bathroom), we plan accordingly and do that task. We are a team, 100%. It doesn't sound like what you've got is a partnership, and you deserve better. 

Don't fall into the sunk cost fallacy; the deposit on the venue is a lot cheaper than spending money on a whole wedding, and divorce later ain't cheap either. "

"I understand.  

You have to understand though, and take this to the bank, this situation is completely f'ed and not going to end well.  

Yes, now legally the house is hers.  And lets face it, she accepted because fuck, who wouldn't.  I understand she pays all the bills, taxes, etc.  That has to amount to allot for a beach house, I'm guessing.  The beach houses closest to me have property taxes alone equal to my mortgage.  

This whole situation is just f'ed and going to end badly.  Your grandfather, family, and sister didn't think this through.  None of this situation was fair to anyone.  Your aunt LOVED this situation because it created unknowns, chaos, etc.  You're right about her, and I know her type.  She is waiting to pounce.

Your sister should have never accepted this ""gift"" without ground rules and a real understanding of what was expected.  

If your family are users (like your aunt), they want the advantage of having a beach house without paying for any of it.  Then when/if your sister goes to sell, rest assured they will be looking for ""their cut"".  Just, fuck,  None of this situation is any good.  UNLESS your sister doesn't give 2 fucks about the family.  Then sell it and profit.   "

"Do you date a lot of men significantly shorter than you though? I think height preferences are shallow, but who isn't a bit shallow in what they find physically attractive? I'm a 6ft tall woman, and yeah, I'd prefer to date guys around my height or taller. Women get shit on for having height preferences, but it's honestly nothing I can help. I don't feel sexy around a guy who is shorter than me, and I just don't look at guys who are much shorter than me as potential romantic/sex partners. It's a me problem, not a them problem, but I think it's okay to have a totally arbitrary reason for not wanting to date someone. "
"I don't have tattoos, so it baffles my mind why a tattoo would be so important to you that you would be fucking with your marriage like this. And it baffles me further that if tattoos are that important to you, you would end up marrying someone that dislikes tattoos and actually promise to not get anymore. Is this really that important to you?"
"I think this is an unusual issue, and I'd be surprised if she extended this type of request to issues that are actually small. If she does, you should shut those down of course. "
"Your first bullet sounds like a bit the silent treatment. Did she ask for this? Was it discussed? Did you decide your own what you need to do? Your wife wants to rebuild a relationship, but you can't do that without intimacy.

Also you say you're taking all this time and space, are you giving her time and space? Does she have friends? Is she exploring hobbies? Is she just sitting around waiting for you to get better?

Immediately relationship overhauls are jarring. You're putting yourself first... But let's face it, you were putting yourself first before with your manipulations. What's changed? You STILL get what you want.

You're not going to fix this yourself. You need long term outside perspective via therapy."
"She's 5'11, he's 5'6. She wants someone closer to her own height. Aka taller."
"Here are his words. They are not the words of ""someone who doesn't give a damn"":

&gt;“I hope it’s a fun thing and not a practical thing,” “he would hate it to be an appliance,” and many other things that made me realize that he was NOT going to like my gift. I had failed once again."
"My original advice would have been ""Stop trying to plan a big birthday for someone who says they don't want one."" Then I saw this part:

&gt;To the point that after 7 years he still says he has had a disappointing birthday every year of his life.

and this:

&gt;For weeks, I pleaded and begged him to tell me what he wanted. He would say something, just to immediately take it back and explain why it wouldn’t make a good gift or why he wouldn’t actually use that particular item.

and this:

&gt;It’s been days since the incident and he still says I ruined his birthday. He will not forgive me for what I did, so far as to say he no longer wants to go on the trip we planned, he rather just be alone...and that all he will remember of his 30th birthday is what I shitty time I made it for him.

This is not the behavior of someone who doesn't want a fuss made over him about his birthday. This is somebody who has made pleasing him on his birthday into a game that you can't win. EVER. He seems to delight in having you come up with elaborate birthday scenarios and then crushing you by saying that you've failed again, and that he didn't enjoy it. That's not a healthy dynamic for a relationship. 

Yes, sometimes our spouses give disappointing gifts...and it's okay to say you didn't enjoy something, but it's not ok to say ""you failed and ruined everything"" to your spouse. And it's not ok to do it to you over and over again and not apologize once.

Yes, did you kind of make it about yourself when you got upset that he didn't like your gift. BUT...after years of this behavior, and a lead-up period where he basically baited you with little comments that suggested he might not like the thing you gave him, I can hardly blame you for losing it on him. 

And as for saying it ruined his birthday...he's letting that happen himself. He's letting it ruin his birthday when he could just let it go, get another present, and look forward to the fun vacation you had planned. Instead he's punishing you both.

Y'all need to have some serious talks about this behavior. It's not ok to want to punish your spouse for not getting your birthday right, and I can't help but think he might do this in other contexts as well. 

And next year? Don't bother with his birthday. It's clear he enjoys ruining it for himself, and he can do it that for free.

"The simple fact is that most child predators either know how to get kids to come with them willingly or just strong arm them away from people before anyone notices.

Combine that with the fact that kids bug out over everything and it makes it pretty hard to hear a child be upset in public and not insantly filter it out. "
"Ah, no. Nope. Nuh unh. "
"Wow reading this made me angry. You are truly terrible. All that needs to happen is her family to get a mental professional to state her mental capacity at below the age of consent (which by the fact she can't read and watches tellatubbies is almost definitely the case) and you can be charged with rape. Based on what you've said here, she is not able to consent for herself with the brain damage and that is rape. Back the fuck up, stop talking to her and leave her alone. It's best for both of you, unless you want to go to jail. "
"It is perfectly OK to not want kids.

A lot of times, when people say ""they're not sure,"" it means they don't want them, but are afraid of other peoples' reactions should they say that.  There's a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle pressure to have them.

So that would be your first task.  Think long and hard about it.  Do you really, truly, not want kids?  The fact that you're feeling ""torn"" tells me that you probably don't, but I could be wrong.

Kids are not just **A** dealbreaker, they are **THE** dealbreaker.  Whether kids are had or not, if you stay together, someone will be unhappy.  If you don't agree on this very important point, then you're both probably better off breaking up and finding other people.

This is pretty much the only thing the I recommend breaking up an otherwise good relationship over.
"
"I think it can be a response to him sensing her slipping away without him being malicious or a bad guy. If he loves her and wants to be with her, then maybe he felt the distance growing and was worried (reasonably so) so he quickly made the decision to be with her to try to get things back to where they were. I don't think he wanted to trap her, I just think it's possible he felt her pulling away and tried to chase her. Moving his whole life without talking to her first was inadvisable and immature at best, but I don't think it necessarily - or even probably - came from a bad place.  "
"Your 2nd paragraph is really giving me things to consider. While I do feel pressured by basically everyone around me, I want to marry him too. I want him to want to marry me. He supports me in different ways, but when it comes this, I am feeling alone and starting to feel unsure if he really wants to or not. I see guys who propose after being together with their SO for way less time. They're excited to spend their lives together; I'm not sure my bf feels that, because if he did, why wouldn't it have happened already? 

Perhaps he's too complacent and maybe I am too. We have created a life together and that is hard to say goodbye to."

"Hey I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but it doesn't sound like she's interested in getting to know the guys watching her stream. She's doing this because she likes games, not to find a boyfriend -- in fact she might already have one, or even a girlfriend.

"I don't think 1-2 hours a week of family phone calls is excessive. Can they be timed better or happen on a different day? Can you turn that chunk of time into family movie time so you can chill while the kids watch something? This is a conversation for you to have with your wife, not your MIL. If you are going around your wife to talk to her MIL about the calls then you ARE trying to control your wife and you are trying to prevent her from talking to her mom. If you address the unmet need with your wife (you getting a break from the kids on the weekend) and work together to solve it then you are working as a team and your solution is more likely to stick. Maybe you can hire a sitter for some time Saturday mornings? Or do a playdate trade with another family? "
"Oh man, I have never related to anything as much. I'm in my early twenties and I have a crazy Asian mom. I've been dating my boyfriend for 5+ years and I've only been openly honest with her spending nights or weekends at my boyfriend's place within the last year. She doesn't agree with it. Thinks we need to be married before we should move in together and not the other way around. Whatever, it's her views, I can't change it. I used to lie all the time of my whereabouts in high school AND most of college (looking at the woman with 10:30 curfew still when I'm staying at my mom's) and I always felt guilty. My boyfriend finally sat me down one day and basically told me to grow the fuck up, be an adult, and be honest with my mom because the lying was getting old and ridiculous. So I did. I just flat out told my mom I preferred to stay at his place sometimes because I want to spend more time with him. That's it. She was definitely not happy but she's pretty much accepted it now. Sorry for the long ass post OP, but of course your mom is going to be angry at first but she'll get over it eventually. "
"Are you a parent? The standard advice for introducing foods other than breast milk or formula is to start between 4 and 6 months and to start with very mild foods with no salt or other additives, e.g. pureed vegetables and cereals.

Not to mention the aunt using her nasty unwashed finger for it. 

Yes, the baby is fine and most others would be as well, but it still shows a pretty astounding lack of common sense.

&gt; I was not expecting sex in the first hangout at all.

This irks me because it sounds like sex *was* expected at some point. Please tell me that I'm interpreting this wrong. 

What do you do now? Own up to what you've done. Tell your girlfriend the truth. At this point, you've violated the agreement that you two made when you became exclusive. You don't get to decide whether you stay together or not. She does. It is her right as the wounded party.

If she does want to give you another chance, don't spend any one on one time with other women until you're able to hold yourself truly accountable for your actions. ""It just kinda happened"" is the biggest load of absolute shit, OP. Say that to your girlfriend only if you really want to piss her off.

"Edit:post under wrong comment, meant it to be for fwooby_pwow

Not necessarily true... my mom is an absolutely awful wife and mom and talks utter bullshit bout my dad when she goes to see her family (alone). Had a psychotic episode 2 months ago and threatened twice in one day to disown me, my sister, and my (now) fiance, threatens/secretly says to my sister she wants to divorce my dad because he doesn't buy her anything (she pays for nothing when it comes to bills except her credit card and phone because she is shit at money-handling) and blames everyone but herself when she does something wrong and is called out on it. 

My dad told me not but 7 days ago that he still loves her. And my siblings and I can't figure out FUCKING why. 

OP's dad may just be sticking it out for OP, but he may be sticking it out for something else. Regardless, as I end my rant, 

TO OP: you can't fix any issues your parents are having, even if you keep this issue a secret just so you can focus on school/prevent a potentially inevitable, divorce. I think with a breach of trust this large from someone that should always have taken care of you is enough to confide in the other parent of how grossly violated you feel (it is okay to feel this way.)

If you do tell your dad, I recommend asking him to help you with some therapy sessions, and it may not be bad for him to get some himself. 

I hope you end up well, and a follow-up post would be nice. If you haven't been yet, r/raisedbynarcissists is potentially a good subreddit for you. R/legaladvice may be as well.    "

"Not really. Sometimes kids get really upset over stuff. You've never heard a kid screaming before because they're getting in trouble or their iPad got taken away or something? I'm not saying that couldn't be abuse, just that there's nothing to indicate that it is."
"Please consider we are only getting OP's version of events. It's only natural he would convey his actions as acceptable and downplay any aggression or otherwise unhealthy ways of communicating his feelings.

Having an emotion doesn't give you the right to express it however you want. In a relationship, anger is an especially volatile emotion to deal with so it's incredibly important to express it in a healthy and productive fashion. 

If you want your partner to talk to you during stressful times, you have to do your part to build an environment that fosters the conversation rather than one that feels hostile. I guarantee you OP is not doing everything he can to avoid the latter.

What I hear when he says ""I was getting pretty heated"" is that this was turning into a yelling match. This does nothing more to fix any of their problems than her leaving, but he's still giving himself the credit. In my experience, the productivity of a conversation is inversely proportional to the volume it happens at."

"it's not cruel, but I'd break it to him in a firm but gentle way. sending something spiteful (as several others have suggested) might be your right, but it's not a very good impulse to indulge.

I really wish you all the best, and hope life treats you kindly and that you find the support you need. if you find yourself in crisis, I hope you'll reach out to a therapist - things *can* get better. have a good life, (name). take care.""

But for me it crosses a line when he says your height wasn't just a fluke and he wants to produce only tall children. What happens if a kid is short? Will he consider it a complete failure?

So don't be peer pressured into getting back with her because you need to look out for yourself even if they won't. But be prepared to lose some of your friends if you don't want to interact with her at all. 

I think you need to start branching out and meet new people and new friends so you can feel less pressure to keep the friend group together. Also discuss this with your therapist so you can hash out what you truly want without people hounding you so you don't regret the decision. Do you see a future with her, can you ever look past her abandoning you, can you be civil to her in a public space, do you even love her anymore? You need a ton of time to figure this out on your own without external pressure. So, don't add her and tell a close friend that you would like to be left alone to make your decision.

"65 year old women don't throw tantrums. 65 year old women are capable of calling an airline to reschedule their own flight. unless the mother has mental health issues that either OP hasn't disclosed to us, or perhaps genuinely doesn't know about, then there is no excuse for this sort of behavior from a grown ass woman.

As much as I loved that post and was thinking the same thing I doubt they'd be ready for another tenrec while they're struggling with losing the first one 
"I didn't just say ""I love you. I'm going to bed."" There was a lot said outside of that. We texted for quite awhile. "
"Ugh, this opinion you have and what you take out of that conversation is gross.

Women are allowed friendships, friendships do not mean owed relationships or sex. There is no friendzone, just people who can't accept want the other person wants. If you want something different, then move on.


Do you consider male friends friend zoned too, obviously not. So why would you think that of women unless you feel men are owed something for their friendship?"
"It's not unrealistic, but you may need to accept the fact that your career opportunities will be limited depending on where they live."
and yet OP seems to be intending to stay :-(
You also typed wrote instead of road but it's charmingly appropriate. 
"Some people like to force others to adhere to polite social norms, and use the excuse that they're just being nice when any ordinary person could see that they're pushing it and being obnoxious. I've worked with a guy like that, and it started to feel like a weird form of bullying, like he was hoping I'd snap at him. He'd hold a door open for me for a minute or longer when I was in a room working on a task, dumb shit like that.

I feel OP's pain. Behavior like that guy's is aggressive and does make your skin crawl after long enough.

(Edited to add: People like this don't ""get the hint,"" they get off on pushing other peoples' buttons and are fully doing it on purpose.)"
"Agreed, it's so disturbingly calculated to hurt her too. I also think it makes it even more disturbing that it wasn't a fit of anger type of thing. Like some commenters are using the word tantrum but the way OP describes it, this was more ... Deliberate? Like lashing out in anger and suddenly erasing the board in rage would also be awful but the way OP describes it seems colder. Which to me almost makes it worse. "
"Do you think she can prove the separated shoulder thing? If not, just get out now. She is all sorts of crazy. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you finish in her without a condom. In fact, buy your own condoms and keep them away from her to make sure she's not making holes in them."
I can't see not completing a tattoo once started tho. That's crazy. 
"In fact, there's a thread *right now* about a woman who wants to get more tattoos even though her husband doesn't like them. People have the right of it there: the husband isn't shallow. This girlfriend isn't shallow either."
She was a child they created and it was their fucking job to guide her and raise her and teach her healthy coping skills. 
"&gt; having her friend do what she should have done (as in, telling you what is going on/where she is

Well OP says she left her phone in the hotel room, so she couldn't really text him herself. Since she ran out of the room crying, it's unclear if she left it on purpose or not, but I'm guessing not."
"Only one of you has a say in where you live. 

Hint: it isn't him."
"OP, don't you dare call and cancel! Get your dog. You've been open and honest and he hasn't, if this didn't end your relationship something else would have. What's the next thing this guy is going to shut down over? You'll regret it forever if you don't get the dog you've wanted for years. "
"She doesn't like you as anything more than a friend, and she is engaged. I'm cringing at your paragraph about going into Comp Sci and being better than her partner because of that. "
"I mean if she's telling you exactly that she's emotionally unavailable and is gonna ghost you that's probably what's gonna happen. 

if you want to make yourself feel bummed out that it won't work out how you want you can keep hanging out with her w/ the expectation of something happening when she almost explicitly told you the opposite but hey you do you my man

I personally would not pursue a relationship outside of friendship with her"
"LEAVE. LEAAAAAAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

What the f? 7 women? That you know of. He has more than a problem. Your children won't be damaged by you divorcing someone who can't treat their mother properly. What will damage them is learning its okay to stay with someond who betrays you time and time again.

Gtfo as soon as you can. "
"This is gonna sound bs but you wouldn't have to prove it if you are confident. 

I'm not saying all this to put you down. Just that being more self-aware about yourself would help you fix any issues facing you including this one. 

I do the same thing around women where I only talk to them as long as I see them as a potential date and while I have a few female friends, they're definitely not close. I've definitely not fixed it yet but for now what I've been doing is only putting areas I can see girls in terms of attraction (i.e. when I go out) and not the other times. I think it's getting better. "
"Then maybe this relationship isn't for you.  she's not letting you talk abotu your feelings and you continuously distrust her to the point of internet sleuthing.  And if there are many red flags, then I guess at this point it really is time to go.  You can try talking to her again I suppose but it seemed futile before."
"To combine a bit of /r/legaladvice and /r/relationships:

IANAL but the most common minimum length I've seen for most eviction notices is 30 days (though in some cases/states it can be as low as 7). That said, the actual eviction process takes MUCH longer. As you can imagine, it will also pretty much wreck your relationship with this person.

So basically, if it were me- I wouldn't go down the eviction route yet, unless I thought that they would refuse to leave in Sept when their ""lease"" is up. To save the relationship, I'd either just put up with the kid for the 2 weeks you have to (4 weeks/every other week), OR I would bribe them to leave (cash for keys style). 

Definitely give legaladvice a poke, but I think that eviction is probably outside the realm of what is worth doing, based on this information in the OP.

EDIT: For relationship and legal purposes, though, I'd alert them ASAP (since it is coming close ot being within 30 days of the end of their ""lease"") that you won't be interested in renewing it and they should look into other options."
"Thanks for the advice. Yeah, these are all subjects I'd want to talk about with her. I think it'll help me make the decision on if I want to continue in the relationship. "
"If we could link, I would put the nopetopus here. "
i guess i just don't understand what this accomplishes and it seems like a dumb and lowkey manipulative move. 
I'm honestly so ready to channel my 7 year old self with this project haha
"Yeah, I'm not suggesting that she complain to the property manager about the tenants. I'm suggesting that she report the property manager to the city. The property management company already knows about the crowded apartments. She said maintenance is in and out of the building for a pest problem and other issues. If it's as crowded as she describes, that would be obvious to a property manager who cares at all. "
"/u/petloversis, the idea shared by /u/billytheskidd is a really good one. If she can find a social media operative she likes, it could be a great investment in terms of future sponsorships and documentation, moving forward. 

Your sister sounds pretty great, and like she has a good bro. "
"&gt;A friend of mine just told me some crazy story about it that I can't remember but the moral was if your gut is telling you to go, don't hesitate.

Gotta love the honesty &lt;3 hahaha. But yes, Is just like sometimes your gut gets a bit confused and you have to take a deep breath and ask again. 

Its funny because a lot of those WW2 refugees came to my country... It was lovely back then. I guess live is a circle.

Thanks! "
"Yeah but would you turn it into a screaming, pleading, sobbing match? Seems like an overreaction for something annoying. I'd be concerned if I were OP too."
"You showered and cuddled clothed. Nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, I wouldn't have even faulted you if you did have hot shower sex--you were single, he was not a relative by blood or marriage. You did nothing wrong and your husband's extreme reaction is scary to me. You and your daughter shouldn't have to live in fear that every little thing in your past could upset him. And the way he responded was abusive. And it's telling, to me, that you're feeling bad over something you shouldn't. I'd urge you to get into counseling..."
"&gt; Should I give them to her myself, or get them delivered? I just want her to melt..

Depends on the result you are looking for.

If you live together (or close to each other) and see each other every day, a small flower delivery during the day will help brighten her mood and give her time to relish the act of kindness before she ever sees you. In many cases, that leads to a more intimate connection when she sees you later.

If you do not live together or see each other every day, a surprise visit with a bouquet of flowers can certainly show you care and ""make her melt"".

&gt; I'm going to put a message like ""thinking of you"" or something simple. I think this is best?

Simple is sometimes the best route. Why right a book on a notecard when you can say how you feel in a few short words? ""Thinking of you"", ""Missing you"", etc are all very powerful when handled correctly.

&gt; Every decent bouquet I can find is about $70 delivered. Is that a lot, or is this normal?

Again, it depends. If you are going to do a delivery option, $70 sounds fair for a medium sized bouquet from an online retailer or local store. For hand deliveries, you can expect to pay between $50 and $100 on average for a mixed bouquet in varying sizes.

&gt; I'm not sure if I should go for a summer theme or romantic theme, too... I think she likes sweet things... Any advice? Clueless guy here.

Don't overthink it and do what feels right to you. If she likes sweets, include a little box of chocolates. If she is more of a hands-on girl, a small stuffed animal may suffice. Don't worry too much about the theme of the flowers. While they each mean something different (a dozen roses vs a mixed bouquet for instance), you will find the ones that you think will represent your feelings.

Way to set the bar high there - let us know how it goes!"
"I felt as much. The novelty of having people around  that are tall like him will hopefully wear off, but if not, then it's also okay to let him know that his obssession over heights is off-putting (if it is, never mind what your friend says). I would think that someone who has been ridiculed over a physical feature they have no control over, would make that a point of reference in his every day life, because that is how the world has viewed him up until now. I feel bad for him. "
"Attractive young human female checking in. I would totally date a guy with a stutter. I would not date a guy that was incredibly insecure or that considered women a different species from him. 

I think some exposure and some therapy would be very useful for you. You gotta own and love who you are if anyone else is going to."

"1) ""she insisted on jumping my bones."" How about instead of blaming her, you just say you fucked up. 

2) if she manipulated you into this situation, why would you reward her behavior with a present?"
"Sorry you're going through this -- you're not the problem. However, if you stayed after that, he probably thinks (correctly, if I'm honest) that he can do whatever he wants. 

What would he have to do for you to break up with him? I can't think of anything that's much worse than what's already happened. I'd be out of there like a shot.

"I'd just chalk this up to her being in a mood then.

"I understand how it can be difficult to get out of a relationship with a person. Which you may have to do in this instance. 

If you have attempted countless times to convince him to stop drinking frequently and he does not make an effort to do so it is best you let him go. You cannot have a bright future with someone who has alcoholic tendencies and is not willing to get help.

Imagine if you stay with him and make a family he will cause countless days of stress for you and will threaten your family safety. 

Try to talk to him and/or go to therapy together if you really want to stay in the relationship. If that fails, you don't have any other option but to cut ties with him. 

Good luck. Stay safe. "

"Doesn't take that much maturity to keep a clean house, pay bills on time, and keep enough food in the fridge to not starve. 

Teach him. Teach him now. You letting him slide will make his future relationships more difficult. Most women out there that he comes in contact with will expect him to pull his weight at home. Share the chores and the responsibilities. You're crippling him by doing everything for him and treating him like he's incapable. 

I've told my mom this. She's doing the same thing to my brother and she, being an Asian woman, won't listen to me. I feel sorry for him, I feel sorry for his future partners, and it's upsetting that my mom is too stubborn to understand that we're not living in the 80s anymore. "
"You are not married to your mom. Full fucking stop. You are self admittedly not religious. It's time you grew a spine. Your wife is quite right, if I were married to you, I'd be telling you to quit your bullshit too. If you want to please your mom, then get a divorce and marry a good Jewish girl that your mom picks out for you. But, if you love your wife, then quit your damned bullshit. Circumcision done in religious settings has increased the transmission of herpes from the act of sucking on the penis. It's disgusting. Your son doesn't need to be circumcised, it's an elective procedure.... but if you decide to do it, then it absolutely should happen in a hospital. 

You chose not to be religious. You chose to marry your wife. STOP LETTING YOUR MOM STOMP ALL OVER YOUR MARRIAGE. It would be well worth your time to post this in r/justnomil. Good luck!"
"Hahah you are right dude, I think I'm just crazy "
"He *must* have said something, right? Like literally ""I'm his number one fan."" There must have been something he said, otherwise his wife is kinda nutso. Which isn't really a bad thing, just maybe she is, a little uh, overdoing it?

I really have a hard time believing that he didn't say something significant considering it was *their wedding song*..."
I suggest you keep your head down and start planning an out. Do you work? Have a car? Maybe get one of both? Keep your money to yourself and don't mention how your mom is biased because that won't get you far... Also as for therapy. Maybe tell your mom you're going to therapy and your therapist wants to get to know her because you're living with her.

"thank you! she mentions that his *brother* might have seen it, even...did he consent to being involved, too? 

not only is it disgusting to expose people to your kink without their consent, but if they didn't, their opinion of her is probably much worse than it would be otherwise. if sending that video was unsolicited i think she's right to worry about what they think of her, it's probably nothing kind."

Her mom has kind of checked out. She also doesn't think her daughter can do anything wrong.
"I'm sorry all of your friends are busy, but sometimes these things happen. As to what to do...do whatever you want. Go to sephora and blow some money. Or a bookshop. Or take a fucking hot or freezing cold bath and try to relax. He is a coward. This was incredibly shitty, but it isn't your fault, and doesn't reflect badly upon you, except that perhaps you don't judge character very well. 

Do any and all the things that give you comfort and care right now. Then, hopefully you'll have a friend or two to see and vent and get angry with. Good luck. "

Are you an F or a T? "
"You think he's pathetic for the cheating thing? When I called him out on it during the open relationship fiasco his response was ""Well... I wanted you all for myself. If it will make you feel better about the situation you can date him too.""

What if they buy their own beans and are responsible for cleaning it after they use it. Can you Just show them how you want it maintained?
"I'm glad for you. Even if things *can* improve and change with your husband—even just as co-parents—you still need and deserve the support and the place to explore your own thoughts independently of him. He's taking up all the oxygen in the room with his anger and abuse. You need to breathe and think on your own.

It's worth remembering that in cases of manipulation and abuse, couples counselling is not effective. So please do start with your own mental health. I'd bet your possessive, controlling husband will react poorly to you seeing a therapist on your own. Don't give in. Begin with yourself. If he decides he wants to counselling for you as a couple, that doesn't *replace* your individual therapy. You still get yours, and couples can start in a little while, once your individual needs are getting met. But keep your eyes very open."
Who cares if she's on Facebook in bed while you're sleeping? You sound insufferable and you *totally* owe her a big apology.

"I don't think you're being unreasonable in this case. Being late, change of plans at the last minute so you're not invited, maybe just wanting to hang out with the guys only, that's all pretty minor stuff. And if you're going to be in a serious relationship with someone it's best if you are with someone who has a similar expectation about how you handle those minor things. 

But not coming home at all is just plain rude. Don't date a rude person. 

I'd break up now, if you can do it in a non-attacking way and let them stay there until they move into their dorm that would be nice of you. Since you set that expectation (heh sorry...)"

"I left my abusive ex fiance 2 months before our wedding.  You need to plan to leave next month when he is gone, or sooner.

You know this is wrong and you know it is escalating.  As soon as you put down money it escalated because he knew it would be harder for you to consider leaving with money, time and other people invested in the wedding.  Prove him wrong.

I lost several thousand dollars when I cancelled the wedding and I consider it money well spent.  When I told the truth of his abuse to the people I love, they all rallied around to help me safely escape him.  It sounds like yours would do the same.

Contact them, tell them what is happening, and ask for their help to plan an escape.  When you leave, you are in danger of escalating violence, so do it when he is gone or have a bunch of people or police with you 

PM if you need to talk.  You've got this.  You know it's right to leave."
This is a temp job. Just bite the bullet and finish your two weeks. Going to HR for a minor situation like this won't help anyone especially if you want to continue to work there in the future. 
"Just thought I'd mention that if you are at a private school your family will be getting an excellent staff discount (30, maybe even 40%) off your fees for you to go there. This means your parents would really really be motivated to make you stay put, particularly if it's a really good or prestigious school. 

Even if that's not the case, I think it would be a good idea to tell your mum in specific detail why you feel unhappy at the school. This will be a super embarrassing chat, but your mum knows that she's good looking, she may not know that her good looks are affecting your school life. "
You don't get to tell someone to stop doing something harmless because of your insecurities. OP needs to work on those issues. 
Some people type differently then they speak.
"You know what else sucks?

Spending years of your life trying to make someone who is incapable of treating you with any respect or trust or love do that. Eventually you won't be able to leave the house to get groceries without him flipping out on you. Is it really worth it?"
"&gt; If his actual SO got sick I'm sure it would be a different situation. I don't think it makes a lot of sense to link the two situations.

This.

OP: your boyfriend's decision not to get back with his ex solely for the purpose of taking care of her was not only completely acceptable, it was the healthy thing to do. His purpose on this earth is not to take care of his ex.

If you're very concerned about your boyfriend's views on this subject, you have the right to initiate a conversation about them but please keep in mind the fact that 
there are never any guarantees when it comes to how somebody will respond to a health issue. It's very easy to say ""I'll stick by you and take care of you"" but you can never know how your significant other will actually respond when dealing with a real health issue and not a hypothetical."
"Idk maybe it's me, but I would never use anything my roommates buy without asking first...  

Just ask them not to use it, if they're not assholes I don't think it should be a big deal in my opinion. "
Ask your wife why she wants to sacrifice for her mother when her mother refuses to give anything back in return? You need to have a come to Jesus talk with your wife. Either MIL moves out or starts paying rent.

At least in My Sister's Keeper the parents actually raised their daughter and she was a part of the family. This is just a whole new level of sick."
"I think you also have a problem.  It's not their wife.  It's them, sorry.  If they can't be professional than that's their fault.  Instead of going after the wives you need to grow up and go tell your coworkers.

"And why the fuck would you believe anything this selfish, manipulative ass tells you about how divorce works? Spoiler alert: he probably doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about, and is bullshitting you so you'll do what he wants.

"This sounds spot-on. It's like he thinks he's a magnificent catch that women are dying to snag. I would hit him with some hard truths that being an entrepreneur isn't worth jack if it means he put everything on his life on hold to barely keep his company afloat.

Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with this guy? When you get married, the moment you voice a valid concern, he'll say you won't have what it takes to be his wife. When you have children and disagree about parenting methods? You won't have what it takes to be the mother of his children. Instead of respecting your opinions, he makes you believe the only reason you could possibly find fault with him is because you're inherently flawed. "
"No one is ""pushing a narrative"". Several of the things OP posted raise a few red flags and qualify as abuse. Abuse doesn't have to be physical."
"Do you care about her? Do you love her? Usually people don't just let go without some kind of reason - is she stressed or under go some traumatic event? Something happen that made her just stop caring? If you still care about her - you don't want to address this from ""you're getting fat"", but ""I'm worried about your health. I want us both to be around for a long time.""

Keeping in shape does not ""go without saying"". Some people need to be pushed, and some people need to be ""woken up"" to the reality of what bad health can do to them.

From the tone of your message, I don't get the sense that you love her or see her as a best friend at a deeply emotional level - nor that you are worried about her. You seem to be worried about the fitness level of your sex partner primarily.

If that is the case, I'd let her go and move on, because you shouldn't have to be with someone you aren't attracted to and don't care about, and she shouldn't be with someone under the false pretense that she's loved/cared about much beyond her physical shape. 

I'm not guilt tripping you. I get it. But if that's the case, move on. If you do love her, try to address it with her out of love and concern."

At least you know that. But know this too:

**Just because something is guarded by a dragon, does not mean it is treasure.**

"&gt; ""i need her help trust me""

That was him choosing her and betting on you not leaving."
Just remember not to hold anything against him if he doesn't come around. It isn't his responsibility to feel bad. And you and your girlfriend don't need to go after him for it either. It isn't your job to make someone else feel bad. It was all accidental. 
Nope. Don't do that. That's weird.
"While I agree that the cat isn't their roommates responsibility, the fact of the matter is that that roommate's actions directly led to the cat being killed. OP didn't ask the roommate to bring the cat in and they forgot, the cats had already been put away before OP and his girlfriend left for the night. The roommate left the door open for 1-2 hours by their own admission, which seems frankly irresponsible when you know there are animals living in the house that could get out. At the very least it's common curtesy to then check that the cats didn't get out, because the roommate knows that the cats live there and presumably agreed to live with the cats. Even if they aren't the roommate's direct responsibility, this was pretty clearly their fault. "
"A response right above in this thread said:

Normalizing the narrative viewpoint that sees women as protagonists of their own stories, with their own goals and interests, as their primary meaning, and their status as the object of some dude's ""maybe girlfriend???"" interest as secondary or tertiary, would be useful to you.

If you want to get better at riding horses, spend a lot of time on horses. If you want to get better thinking about women as something other than girlfriend material, spend a lot of time in stories where women are not primarily defined by how much a man wants to be in a relationship with them.

Narrative is the way our brains make sense of patterns in the world around us. So find and experience narratives that support the response to patterns that you want your brain to have (""Ah, I have met an interesting woman! We shall be friends!"") rather than the response currently happening (""Ah, I have met an interesting woman! I wonder if she'll be my next girlfriend?"").


----
If you give yourself a lot of steady exposure to media where women are portrayed as autonomous people in their own right and not defined by their relationship potential to someone, you will eventually have a much easier time viewing women in your life like that, too.

"I think part of maturity is to know when to keep your mouth shut - as I see it most of the people on this sub (who are definitely FOR honesty and open communication) did advise you not to say anything about it, because really, as you said, it didn't mean much.

"As a parent I agree. Forget autism, if I had known Trump would have become president I wouldn't have had a kid. I got lucky, my kid is super normal, but now he gets to deal with the cesspool of a county that the Republican party is making it into."
"Turn it around. Imagine if you said to him, ""oh by the way, I'm banging this other guy.  But I don't want anyone competing, I want you to love me equally. Etc.""

First of all, does that sound like something you would *never* say? I know I wouldn't, because I'd feel like the world's biggest asshole. If you balk at the idea of saying that, that should tell you something.

Second of all, if he's all about the ""open"" relationship but would have a problem with you exploring other people, then that's just a case of wanting to keep you locked down while he plays around.

But in any case - even if he'd been completely honest and ethical about expressing a desire for an open relationship, *you would still be 100% within rights to walk away.*  I think we sometimes think of breakups as ""punishing"" the other person or making a comment on their objective value as a partner. And that's just not always the case. Sometimes a break-up needs to happen because the partners have a major, unresolvable incompatibility. A person who wants monogamy and a person who wants polyamory would definitely be a great example of that."
"She was putting me in stressful situations to kind of show me what she was going through with the business. This was AFTER we had a talk about communication, and I don't feel like I handle passive aggressive people very well. I couldn't outright say, ""you did this on purpose!"" 
I felt trapped."
"No, you didn't. But she's well aware that you're interested in him and would date him if they were to break up. And she's not gonna be too inclined to befriend someone who would probably be happy if her relationship ended. It is what it is. 

You may need to cultivate friendships with everyone else separately. You can hang out with them without Martin or his girlfriend.

Personally I would much much much rather have my husband be able to spend time with me and the kids than have tons of money. What's the point of having all the money if your relationship and health goes down the toilet.

"Totally agree with what you've posted, but I can imagine that - if I were in OP's shoes right now - I probably wouldn't even be interested in going at this point as it would just make me feel like an unwanted house guest. This is what OP's uncle has probably made him feel like when he shouldn't have to feel that way."
He was also not being honest with his girlfriend about you so the fact that he didn't have a problem with it doesn't meant it wasn't problematic behavior. You really need to open your eyes.
"Just because it's something you would do doesn't mean it's something generally expected. If you find yourself in this situation in the future, you should lay down the house rules on the first day. "

"And that's a valid feeling, but you will have to look into this together because your partner is voicing valid concerns about your (and I mean that as a couple) BC methods and he deserves to be heard and have you approach this as a team and find a solution that you a re both comfortable with.

More often than not the guy is reluctant to take any responsibility for BC so he has a refreshing and mature attitude!!!"

"They change the dynamic, but it doesn't mean she's not a good friend. She sounds very much like she supports his happiness and isn't trying to put herself in his way. She's being an unselfish good friend. "

"I'm sorry you're going through this. I refuse bifth control for multiple reasons &amp; my boyfriend understands. He's actually a doctor so I mean he gets it. Maybe try educating him on birth control and it's sides effects?? Condoms are completely safe if you're using them right. Hell, some people even get pregnant on birth control, so nothing is 100% in life."
"I just want to say we've seen some posts about people that ""got over"" their partner's existing tattoos &amp; married them, only to absolutely freak out when their spouse wants another one down the line. So l would consider as part of your decision whether it would be a dealbreaker if she wants more tattoos. (It seems like some non-tattoo people rationalize them as tolerable mistakes, even if the partner with the tattoos does not feel they were mistakes, so that logic falls apart when the partner wants an additional tattoo.)

So it's okay if you decide that having tattoos is a dealbreaker. But it's not okay to try to change your partner if she's still interested in tattoos or is happy with the ones she already has. "

"Man I didn't read the ages in the title and I thought the OP's fiancé was much younger, maybe 20ish. This behavior is unacceptable in anyone but really really worrying in an adult who should be more mature. He doesn't sound like he understands how to have an adult relationship at all unfortunately. And your edit is spot on."
"Does he actually have a great heart? I can't imagine a kind person not caring how they repeatedly hurt their partner by refusing to change an easily-fixable behavior. 

Are you just seeing what you want to see? Does he think of himself as a good person, yet repeatedly do shitty things and make excuses about why he did it, and how it's not his fault? 

Are you projecting your values onto him, when he really just does the bare minimum so he can have the reputation of being a good person?

Does he give himself credit for not being a complete monster, as in - it's not like I'm telling you you're stupid! It's not like I'm hitting you or anything! Well at least I'm not doing X! Translation- how can you be mad at me for this when so could be so much worse!

If any of this sounds familiar, even a little bit, you're probably better off leaving."
"I remember this analogy I heard a while back.  If you have a cake and its the best cake ever, but it has shit frosting, its a shit cake.  You don't eat it and say yeah the frosting it shit but the cake is really good otherwise."
"I think the first thing to do is to understand and empathize with her feelings. Because if you two cant agree on the problem, its going to be impossible to fix. 

And second, I dont think trying to figure out the level of the lie will help at all (If its a decieving lie or not). Because she has been in the dark and feels decieved, and to her it won't matter much if the lie was decieving or not -which seems like it might be the way you're discussing it with her?

 I'm pretty sure she isnt in the mood to discuss the level of this, but is more worried that you two dont communicate well / have different standards of what is or isnt cheating, and without finding a common ground here that can be the foundation of trust she will not be interested in continuing the marriage (as she will never know if she can trust you and will always worry).

So i'd say you should probably cast away any idea of discussing how you categorize this error and rather focus 100% on how she sees this to be able to find out what she needs from you to feel secure and motivated to continue the relationship. I guess it would mean listen throughb all her 7 stages of shock, anger, accusations and crying, be there for her even if she is angry and accusing, and then when she is done and getting to the acception phase she will be more open to accept an apology and discuss ideas on how to solve this. But im pretty sure shes still in the earlyer phases right now andtelling her it ""wasnt that bad"" or ""this was actually harmless"" is not something she is open for hearing until she feels you *really understand* her side of the story and shows her you do care about fixing the feelings she is left with right now. 

But its going to be a process tho so its up to you to choose if you're willing to go through this anger, because the anger will happen, and without giving her the opportunity to really vent it out to you, it will probably just turn into resentment and distrust about when you will do this thing that you think is no big deal  (but is a big deal to her) again.

Yes. Be glad to live in an age and place where such help is available!"
"Yeah, I've been there... and all the thanks I got was more abuse. You can keep wasting your time on him for as long as you want, but you can't make him into a different person. Don't you think if he gave a shit, he would show it? You want a guy who doesn't get belligerently drunk and act like a jackass in your house, well that's not him. You want a guy who will listen to you and respect you, that's not him. "
"Hmm. It is pretty obnoxious to ask someone who is also seated and watching a movie to get up and get you something. Like, pausing the movie is more polite and probably the better way to go. 

Yes, you should have shut it down if it was an issue for you. But I'm assuming that her being an older sister this may have been a dynamic you had from when you were younger, ie your sister talking for you in tough situations like if you were both in trouble with parents or something. So it's worth having a conversation with your sister about boundaries and discuss why she seems cool towards him.

I also think it was a pretty minor disagreement for your SO to leave over. He could have explained himself and the movie could have continued. Might be worth talking about why he felt it was necessary to leave and why you felt it was unnecessary. 

He committed a minor faux pas, she was 
 overzealous and he was oversensitive. Chat with them both about it and move on. I agree with other people that you should distribute time more evenly between locations to give them some space from each other."

I say ""I love you "" to some of my female friends that are really close to me and to all my close male friends, but the ""I love you"" I say to my girlfriend has different meanings.

"&gt;she said it's her own money and I don't have to pay for it at all.

Uh, no. That's like you unilaterally saying ""I'm going to quit my job. But don't worry, it's just my money we're losing so you don't have to pay for what I'm doing."" Because yes, now everything that was covered by your income will come out of hers. 

Your combined salaries are your family's money. Your family meaning you  and your wife. But to follow her premise, her giving away her entire paycheck means you will be living on just your salary, everything that her income used to pay for will have to be paid for with ""your"" money. So you will *absolutely* be paying for it no matter how she wants to frame it. 

If y'all each have a certain amount of ""fun money"" each month, she can give her portion of that to her mom, but otherwise she doesn't get to unilaterally decide to shovel a major portion of your mutual income into what is clearly a (selfish, abusive) black hole. That's not how marriage works. 

I would put my foot down and say that she is not making this decision until she goes to individual therapy to find out why she lets her mother abuse and take advantage of her like this, and couples counseling to work on making decisions together. If she refuses, then it's time to talk about separating more than just finances because otherwise she may throw your entire future right down that black hole.."
"&gt;I found out from her that she's fallen out of love with me and doesn't have the same feelings for me that she once had. To me it seems a little ridiculous

Ok, so despite all your promises to change in this post, that you ""really"" get it now and that you can change, if you truly think what she's saying is ""ridiculous"" then you have not changed. You have not taken to heart that what she's saying is legitimate and real. You think, in your heart of hearts, she's being ridiculous. So no, you haven't changed and you haven't learned. 

This is a life lesson for you. Love wears out when you take it for granted.

Once you've worn out your welcome in someone's heart, those feelings are unlikely to return. "

"I'm a geriatric nurse who works in a large senior living facility. We have everything from independent living communities all the way to locked dementia wards. One thing I see is families who infantilize their elders. Often it's with good intentions, like the desire to keep them safe. 

Numerous studies have shown that active and engaged seniors live longer, happier lives. They have fewer chronic illnesses, fewer hospitalizations and are sharper mentally. 
He is just as likely to trip and fall in a nursing facility as he is at the hardware store. In fact, there are probably more eyes on him there!
The doctors and nurses, if they are worth their salt, should back you on this plan. Unless there are any major health/cognitive issues, then it really is an ideal situation. He has a dependable ride to/from work, an engaged and considerate support system at the store and a sense of purpose and fulfillment. If there is a social worker or case manager at the facility, they may be able to help you with your family and recruiting the medical team to do the same.

My only other advice is to know who his health care proxy is -- the person who makes decisions for him if he is incapacitated. Encourage your grandfather to have a conversation with that person about his wishes if he were, to say, fall and hit his head. Does he want to have surgery? Does he want to go on a breathing machine if necessary? What should the proxy do if his condition is irreversible? This may alleviate some of your family's stress over his safety, knowing that he would rather live fewer years with a great quality of life than many more years as ""half a man"" (a quote from one of my patients, a veteran and dignified gentleman, as we discussed this very topic).

Nope, more lies.

Here's some places you lied.

&gt; I didn't pursue anything

False. You emotionally cheated from the word go.

&gt; our chemistry is through the roof.

You're in the honeymoon period, where your brain chemistry is literally lying to you. If this was true, you wouldn't be posting here.

&gt; He's the best person I know in every way imaginable

False. 1, he's a cheater, and 2, if you couldn't imagine any way for him to be better you wouldn't be here asking how to make him better.

&gt; My boyfriend has massive trust and insecurity issues due to his ex lying about liking sex with him

Yes, it's *definitely* that he could read her mind and know she was lying, and not at all that he was trying to justify his cheating and knows for a fact that you are the kind of girl who cheats, and he should reasonably expect you to cheat on him as soon as his ""new shiny chrome"" wears off, just as it did with the last guy.

&gt; I love him more than anything in the world

If that was true, you wouldn't have encouraged him to do something so self destructive. You would have encouraged him to respect his relationship and find you when he broke things off cleanly. You did not show love by cheating with him, you showed that you enjoy using him.

&gt; But he still thinks I'm lying when I'm not. I don't know how to fix it

You can't. Either he chooses to stop dwelling on the past, gets therapy, and chooses to trust you, or he doesn't. This is out of your hands and you're fooling yourself to think it isn't.

&gt; I know what I did was immeasurably fucked up and selfish... How do you show someone who you hurt in the worst way possible

Well, if you were sincere about this, the answer is to take time apart to each work on individual therapy and look into getting back together if you can conquer your demons.

But it's hard to believe that you actually *do* know you fucked up, because you keep minimizing and justifying the causes for why it would be hard to trust you, and you're heavily distorting reality by choosing to view fudging your pre-relationship sexual history as ""betraying him in the worst way possible"".

I mean, fuck, you should know from experience that ""betraying in the worst way possible"" would be something like cheating, not just ""I didn't indulge your dysfunctions""."
"3 months in, I may not be ready to talk to someone about a child that I lost through pregnancy.

"There are plenty of ways to have sex with 0 chance of pregnancy. If you want to have sex and don't want to use a second birth control method, and he isn't comfortable using just one birth control method, then the only compromise I can see is to stop having penetrative sex.

Oral. Handjobs. Toys. Those are your options that would compromise what you both want.

If you want penetrative sex, you'll have to compromise and choose a backup birth control option to make your boyfriend comfortable with it. If you don't want birth control, you'll have to compromise and choose to stop having penetrative sex.

Discuss that with him, maybe?"

"I'll quote the OP here:

&gt;he asked me to seriously think about whether I would be asking him to give up his time if he were, say, going to the gym or hiking or playing a sport with friends or reading or doing woodworking. I told him that if he spent 60 hours a week woodworking or going to the gym, I would still feel the same.

When my husband and I got into photography together as a hobby, we spent quite a lot of time every week on research, techniques, practicing with each other, but it never exceeded 20-30 hours a week. This was combining with other activities like hiking, taking the kids to the park, watching them ride bikes, going to the zoo, etc. If one of us was spending 60 hours a week on a hobby that excluded the other, that would be problematic. It would cut into all sorts of things, like chores, sleep, sex, bonding/cuddling, talking about our days, etc. 

I had about 12 level 100's in a certain MMORPG before I quit, along with server-first raiding experience. I know what kind of black hole gaming can become.

"Honestly, you need to tell him, but at this point I think he's more likely to feel betrayed that you didn't tell him sooner than upset with the situation itself. It's pretty odd to be involved with someone for seven months and not talk about something like this.

"Ok, not saying that this is the case here with OP (because we don't have that kind of deep knowledge into the specific family dynamics). 


Being a male/son in an indian family is really a god like position. That often means that the son, regardless of his age, has a huge amount of power over any female family member. A sister could be 10 years older and the brother could very well decide if she is allowed to go to college or not.



Little brothers (or brothers of any age) in India often undertake roles which have a great impact on the sister, like monitoring friends or out of school activities for example or dropping them off at school or picking them up. Access to the phone or social media accounts is usual too. 


What a brother says in regards to his sister does have an impact on the family dynamics. I have seen it a couple of times in indian families, where the sister was supposed to undergo an arranged marriage, but due to brotherly intervention it was prevented. 


So what I want to say is, age doesn't matter that much when it comes to indian family dynamis. Indian boys are teached at a very young age that they are better than girls. And with this knowledge comes the understanding of the imbalance in equality between boys and girls. Boys are taken far more serious than girls regardless of age and 13 years old isn't that young, especially for indian people (think about the early marriages in indian communities, usually 25 is the 'deadline'). 
Also OP stated, that the imbalance is still happening, for example that he still favored because he has a child and his sisters are unmarried.



I don't want to say that OP is responsible for the imbalance or should have spoken up, but he certainly could have  and it could have changed things for the sisters to some extend.

&gt; Another example of Chase having some stereotypical ""fabulous gay guy"" mannerisms. He'll playfully push me on the shoulder

You also did say that touching shoulders was a ""gay mannerism""."
"Really appreciate hearing more than just ""talk to a lawyer"". Thank you for the tips."
"But she then told him it was an accident and he only got madder as she clarified it. 



Why would you even assume your girlfriend is flashing her nipple at your relatives unless you already have a reason to be suspicious? Bikinis are often like that and shit happens. "
"Don't wait a year for big, scary sounding things to slip out? You don't have to lead with it, but you clearly anticipated that it would be an issue and did not do much to lay groundwork for it. I can understand your reasoning, but the longer you hold onto something like this, the more it seems like a big deal."

i like this one best
"&gt;Seems a little entitled to go to someone else's house and passively demand 3x the normal serving of food

I really don't think OP was demanding three times this: ""Their plates are PILED with food. A mountain of peas and carrots, a load of mashed potatoes, and two bbq chicken breasts along with two or three drumsticks/flats."" 

Do you? "

"Honestly, I think odds are against him. Too many little convenient things popping up. Unfortunately, at this point he's probably had enough time to delete everything (which i don't blame you for, it's a bit of a whammy).

Sure some people delete messages- but *just* as something suspicious comes up? Awful convenient. Doubly so if those are used for work, you usually don't want to go deleting stuff like that. Also, a ""crazy"" girl has been chasing him, and he didn't think to mention it to you ever? Seems strange... especially with the half dozen other things.

&gt;I checked our records but none of the most common numbers are suspicious. His most frequently texted numbers are me, 3 of his friends, and his brother. All the other calls/texts were one off. There's way too many for me to check every single one since he uses his phone for work and calls a crap ton of people, but I don't think he would be dumb enough to use his phone to cheat

I'd keep digging. Yes, it's a pain, but it's your marriage, and it's only a couple months. It's doable. I'm not sure if you have paper copies, but if they're electronic, using automated search functions for her number might help.

It also might be worth trying to reach out and ask her if they texted. They may have been using an app like snapchat or kik. She seems pretty friendly, so you have nothing to lose. (And if she's making stuff up, it will be pretty easy to confirm)

&gt;She tried to make a move a few weeks ago and when he turned her down she went a little crazy

One easy check you can do is to see if they were still going to lunch after she ""went crazy"". You can also check credit card statements to see if those places/dates line up.

&gt; All she had to show me as ""proof"" was her employee badge and a few emails between the two of them. The emails weren't in and of themselves incriminating. No sex talk, no ""I love you"", just asking to meet for lunch or what time the other would be off work.

This seems extremely tame for a ""crazy"" person. I'm pretty skeptical. Maybe they wouldn't go into full detail, but nothing at all?

&gt;but to go to HR and file a complaint. He thanked me for getting the emails (which he claimed were fake) and said I might need to come in as well to give a statement.

Was this supposedly his company email she was emailing? Because odds are, if they're halfway competent, they have backups. If he's trying to cover something, this is going to bite him in the ass.

Don't let him drop the HR thing.

&gt;he's been staying out of the apartment a lot, saying he can't be around someone who would accuse him of something so horrible.

The super indignant response isn't proof, but it's usually pretty telling. If someone is innocent, their first reaction is usually to soothe and prove it, not get all defensive. That usually happens when someone is caught, and they're flailing to get you to drop it.
