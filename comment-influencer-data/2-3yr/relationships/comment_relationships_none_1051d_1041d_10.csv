I had a friend who did that too. His father was a total POS and he felt it was better for the name to die.
"This is completely how I get by. I have all my gf's family's birthdays, her parents anniversary (they absolutely loved getting a card), and my parents anniversary in my Google calendar (I do manage to remember her birthday and my immediate family's without a problem, I'm not THAT bad...usually...). Beyond that, I literally fill the calendar up with appointments and when we plan things (LDR), that way I actually have a record of what's coming up (easier to remember) and when we did things (harder to remember). There are so many ways to remember dates now, it just requires the initiative to do it.  
**Edit:** Also to add, for Android, the Google calendar has a widget that shows the current date and you can scroll down to see what events are coming in order of occurrence and when. It's REALLY awesome and generally the reason why I use it. Not as good for far off events, but great for keeping tabs on what's coming up. I primarily used that during college to keep track of classes."
"The dudes working not like he's choosing this 
I get that this means a lot to you and stuff but TBH you're not a kid anymore and it's Christmas not the end of the world "
"Is this a condo that you own or rent? I am not sure which is more common where you live.

I have an HOA and I had to sign my life away when I moved in, giving them permission to foreclose on me for a variety of reasons, including non-payment of fees.

Several of the units in our association are rentals, but the landlords are responsibly for ensuring that their tenants follow the HOA rules.

I had an issue with a neighbor down the way from with loud music at all hours of the night. Calls to the HOA resulted in letters being sent to the landlord and eventually fines being levied. The problem resident eventually moved out or was evicted and the problem was solved.

Like other posters have mentioned, this is one good thing that HOAs can be good for.

That, and making sure everyone has the same color door."
"Actually, I think if she wanted a themed wedding too it would be easier. Even if it was wildly different, you could easily do it 50/50 and have a lot of fun with it. As it is, it's a bit weird to have a half traditional and half themed wedding."
"Oops, you're right. That makes it even worse! OP sounds like an awesome, loving girlfriend. Her fiance needs a serious reality check. "
"I have a somewhat similar situation. Except my bf and I work together. 

There's a girl who works on his team and she's very attached to him, wants his attention a lot. It came to a point that even though I know he isn't doing anything (I work in the same office, so I can tell he ignores her half the time), it was getting on my nerves because she's so needy. 

I ranted to him about it, and we had a couple of fights until I decided to be the bigger person. This girl was going through a break up and is in a generally shitty situation, so I talked to her. Turns out, she wants my approval/friendship as well as his. It's not a matter of wanting to date him or whatever, but her being lonely and seeing him as someone she can talk to. And while I'm not going to invite her over to parties or anything, I feel much better about the situation now. And honestly, I feel pretty sorry for her. "
"OP please call the ManKind Initiative at 01823 334244 (available Mon-Friday daytime and evenings) or the Mens Advice Line 0808 801 0327 someplace where you have privacy. 

They can give you someone to talk to and help refer you to services. You don't have to live like this. Unfortunately her abuse is only going to get worse."
"I am so sorry, I really hoped it'd turned out better. But actually it is even worse than I thought. 

You husband played you with all this ""how could you even think"" bs. 
He may not had cheated yet, but he had intentions and you caught him. He played the card of offended innocence, gaslighted you (I give 2000 dollars to women in need all the time, I am so kind and generous, that is why!), manipulated you into blaming yourself and apologizing.  

This is so not good. Bad, bad sign. 

Apart from possible cheating and marriage troubles with this ahem nice polite young woman - with cash donations like this you are growing a big fat parasite. "
"""I'm a dirty yeasty piece of bread and I want to be slathered in butter""?"
"&gt; It's what he told me, but considering he's been pretty upfront about his past transgressions thus far, I have no reason not to believe him.

The best lies are cloaked with enough truth to make you swallow the whole thing."
"Uh, no. This is shady AF. $500 for 2 cleanings?? What?? Like twice a month? Or twice a week? Either way, uh-uh. The fact that he is so adament to the point of paying her off of his side business' credit card over your own children's tutoring says enough. Something more is definitely going on. "
You just worded it perfectly 
"You guys have handled this in a mature, thoughtful manner.  Y'all are therefore banned from /r/relationships until someone in your set steps up and gets shoved shirtless into a police cruiser.  ;D"
"Your last sentence should be all you need to take away from this. 

You two got together before you had a chance to find out who you really are. People grow and mature an incredible amount in their early 20s. Maybe when you first got together you two were compatible, but it looks like you're maturing to have very understandable needs and standards and that you no longer fit into the mold of what he is looking for. 

You deserve someone better than this. You deserve someone that wants you to enjoy sex as much as they do. You deserve someone that wouldn't ask this of you."
"It does sound like schizophrenia, but do he and his friend do DXM (robotripping) at all by any chance though? Higher doses can basically mimic psychosis for alarmingly long periods of time and people tend to overlook how powerful it is bc you can just buy it at the store."
"You would be surprised how many things can inhibit the contraceptive pill's effectiveness:

- not taking it at exactly the same time every day.
- being ill.
- being over or underweight.

Three things off the top of my head. The pill is 92% effective according to actual use statistics."
"I think he needs to realise that he'll have to stop being the ""fun"" parent if he wants his son fulltime."
"Not even close to true. According to most BAC charts, a 90 lb women with one drink, the lowest weight on the chart, would not exceed legal drinking limits. So your statement of ""most people"" is 100% false. "
"I can't fathom this. Here in Scotland, the legal limit of blood alcohol equates to less than a pint of regular strength lager for a full grown man. As a rule, even one drink is legally risky so there is no judging your limits - you don't drink and drive. I would never get in the car of someone who'd had even one, and I find it mad how lax some drink drive laws are!"
"I'm trying to see if there's any justification on why you're mom might be saying these kinds of things about him. If this one conversation triggered this sort of reaction in her, I think she's completely overboard.

It's really hard to distance yourself from family and it's definitely not easy too. But it doesn't seem like your boyfriend and mother are going to be compatible. You may not get the relief you're looking for until you're completely on your own. 

For now, I would sit down with your mom and gently, but sternly explain to her that you don't date to make her happy. You date to make yourself happy and that's why you're with your boyfriend."
"I'd say ""dad, the new bathroom is great and I want to follow your rules for it. I don't want to spend 10 minutes after every shower cleaning it and I don't want to miss one of your rules and get in trouble. Can I shower in your and mom's bathroom? You should take the new one for yourself, you really love it and should get ot enjoy it yourself."" 

If he says something like ""No! I did that bathroom for you and you're being ungrateful"", I'd respond ""It's just stressful every time I use it because I worry I will forget one of the rules. And as nice as the shower is, sometimes I'd just like to go about my day instead of wiping everything down to your standards, which again is stressful because I worry I will miss something.""

But I wouldn't blame you if you don't want to go this route- He doesn't seem like he can be reasoned with on this. Maybe shower after you get home from school and before he gets home from work? "
Head to r/justnomil because someday your mother is going to be one and you should be prepared.
"Whaaaa? *She* hasn't said anything, this is about a struggle within his own mindset and about his own behavior."
"I wouldn't get them a plant. If they're too depressed to take care of it and it dies, they'll feel even worse"
"You'll likely get the last laugh in a few years when he finally wakes up to her bullshit and divorces her, but then realises that he burned all his bridges and threw away all his friendships and relationships because of her. He'll be all alone. Good chance you and everyone else will tell him to get fucked when he tries to crawl back.

Not only that, but he'll also get absolutely reamed in the divorce settlement and end up living somewhere shit while paying 85%+ of his pay check to Jordyn in the form of alimony and child support for a kid he never sees. And there is no way that lazy mooch ever gets a job. She'll live off that money and quickly remarry another poor sucker when Mia is about to turn 18 and the cash cow is on its last legs. 

And you better believe that if Jordyn will use Mia as a weapon against your parents, she'll damn well use Mia as a weapon against your brother when shit does downhill between them. It's going to be terrifying for your brother the first time she does it to him and he realises what he has been allowing.

"I don't think she's an ex. This is the first time OP has heard of her, if it was such a serious relationship that ended surely he would have mentioned their relationship before. I wouldn't be surprised if he's cheating with this woman and called her an ex as shitty excuse not to show his face and blow his cover. "
"Your expectations of humans are way too high, dude. You argued about her falling asleep and then her not waking up. Why are you getting so worked up about something so irrelevant in the grand scheme of life? What a waste of time. "
"Oh no, he lived with the family. Talked and joked with the kids, just spoke no word to his wife and went silent whenever she tried to speak to him."
A wedding is about celebrating the bride and grooms relationship.  The focus is on them.  So going to a wedding to celebrate YOUR relationship is not good.
"I agree with this and am surprised people are recommending it. It's a family computer, but that presumably means someone other than OP bought and paid for it. If it's dad's computer, he has a right to keep his porn on it. If OP lives at home at 25, deleting her dad's computer data is a great way to get kicked out. She can be offended and can even confront him, but passive-aggressively deleting the porn (while leaving a note so that the confrontation can automatically be ugly, instead of talking about it like an adult) is a terrible idea."
"No. You don't need to communicate with her, if you see her in public be civil, if she is around when you are with your friends be civil, but you don't need her number or an open communication platform with her for any reason. She has made it clear she is moving in a different direction, let her. 

As an aside she seems to love attention (really wanting to officially break up on a bus?!?) the number one this you can do to ignore her is speak when spoken to but other wise ignore her."

"You're not really obligated to let your boss know. If he's out and working, he's served his time to society. He's been living with the weight of this crime for 20-30 years and more than likely would like to just leave this behind him and make an attempt at a normal life. 

Whether you say anything to him really depends on how mature you can be in approaching the conversation. Make it just that; a conversation. Don't just drop him, or get distant with him. Be tactful, give him a chance to maybe open up about it. Most importantly, try not to be judge-mental. "
This would be so cute tbh
"Dude, no they don't. One of their biggest points is that these false accusations make it even harder for real victims and that's why we as a society, should take these cases more seriously and actually punish those that make these false claims. We should make harsher punishments and do more to discourage these types of false accusations. 

But as it stands now, in many of these cases (such as the Duke case) the false accusation faces no consequences at all... while the real victims, the men that were falsely accused, are still living with the stigma associated to their name for the rest of their lives.

&gt;""Shut up.""

Typical. Someone says something that goes against your narrow world view and instead of trying to consider other perspectives you immediately try to silence them and shut it down. That's really sad.. "
Better call Nev first.
"Do you know how hard that is to do legally? Once you have a child with someone they will be in your life for a very very long time whether you like it or not. There is no separation unless the husband decides he wants nothing to do with the child and signs away his rights, which it doesn't sound like he would do. "
"Since you consider her obnoxious and not someone that you want to invest any more of your energy in, I don't think it should be your obligation to school her on how to behave. There's no incentive for her to change to suit you if you're bailing on her. There's no way to nicely say ""You suck, everybody thinks so, and they will continue to, so I'm off."" She will lack the insight to connect the dots."
Right!! I mean come on! Op only wants to get married now to secure his sugar momma benefits. I hope the gf sees through this. 
I think you should ask yourself why you do that. 
"Thank you.

Right now, my wife has resorted to avoiding him and not allowing our daughters near him. I can't blame her. I have pretty much done the up to you thing. His mother no longer talks much on the phone. THey do email and I monitor the emails as per the CO. So she has largely stopped the alienating language.

She was held in contempt of the CO several times. It finally caught up to her.

He is currently with a great therapist. It took us a while who could communicate his issues to us properly. He just won't let her help him.
"
"""Mom,

I have tried for years to have a relationship with Dad, despite his abuse. But Halloween was the last straw. I will not put my child or any other child through the hell I went through in my childhood. If this means you will no longer have a relationship with me or your grandson, I will be sad, but it won't change my mind.

Love,

Daughter."""
OP said elsewhere that the travel fund her grandparents started for her can only be withdrawn through them. So she was asking them for the money in her travel fund. 
You can get some basic cameras on Amazon for even less than that.
"Here's the thing, deliberately excluding you SIL from your wedding is a pretty shit thing to do. It doesn't matter that you don't get along super well. She is your brothers wife, he has chosen her and continues to choose her. Suck it up or accept that none of them will be at your wedding.

The best scenario you can hope for is you brother, his wife and your niece with them paying for one flight."
"What do you think he's supposed to think? His girlfriend is getting texts from his best friend, and the usually open GF has to snatch the phone away and make up an excuse? That just looks bad."
Yep. I told our priest I'm iffy about the whole god thing and disagree with the church's politics. They're still going to marry us. 
"If my boyfriend walked because I wanted a timeline for my life plan, I'd lock the door behind him. "
"Agreed. She's not just tearing into him, she's accusing him of deliberately doing something serious that he did accidentally and also slandering him to her friends.

Yeah, I'd be blocking that shit out of my life too."
"Yep sell his computer, remove all Internet and generally make things hell for him.  Maybe he'll get the hint and try to move out on his own if he doesn't get his own way."
That doesn't make him not a real man. She just has preferences . I am not attracted to cross dressing men but I don't think that takes away from them being a man. 
"*""there's no way they'd let me do that""*  OP, they may not chose to fund or facilitate your moving out but there's no way they can [legally] stop you.  My advice is to finish your college education in a subject that will help you get a good job, get a good job at least 200 miles from your family and under no circumstances whatsoever, consider moving back to their house after you graduate.  Save as much money as you can while you are in school to get your first apartment.  There's helicopter parenting and then there's ""child is property"" and I'm afraid your parent think they own their dna forever.  And btw, keep to yourself your evolving views on religion and politics.  They don't need to know."
Never give up school for a relationship. Go. Even your username is about your dream of going to this school and not your bf.
"Honestly this is such a massive danger for your son, you need to be able to trust him. I dont think you are overreacting - the opposite.

He sounds incredibly selfish.

I would be threatening divorce in your situation to shock him out of his stupor, unless:

1.  He goes to the doctor about his snoring/sleep apnia and deals with it properly.

2.  He goes to bed every night at a reasonable time, certainly no later than midnight and realistically earlier - he CANNOT live like this he has a child FFS.

3.  He agrees never to nap while watching your child, and accepts that this may mean he cant get too comfortable on the sofa.

4.  He stops LYING to you about not sleeping.  "
"&gt;Issues with showing affection
&gt;No one would say he doesn't love me

Sorry, I will!

I'm mentally ill in like 4 different direction and my BF has ADHD and depression. Horrible short term memory, just the worst. Had to remind him my bday was coming up in a week. Still know I can rely on him to do something nice for it and not lie to people about it. Because when he says he'd do anything for me, I know that he would.

Mental illness ain't the issue. It's your bf's honesty. Not sorry to say he sounds like he has few if any redeeming qualities."
"You don't have to do anything.  You can just ignore her the same way she ignored you.  You don't owe her an explanation, and you aren't obligated to hear her out.  She threw away the friendship two years ago, so that's on her."
"This IS hilarious and I know that they can't hurt me. It's just this horrible innate fear that I can't shake. I WISH I could just grab 'em and toss them elsewhere, but I suck."
"If you don't let your dad know what this woman said, then you are doing a massive disservice to him. It's your duty to inform him of what she said, and you'll be really letting him down if you don't.

Also, fuck her."
"Alright. I'm sitting in the chair backwards and my baseball cap is askew. Get ready for some relatable teen talk.

I was a lot like you. I developed kinda early and considered myself a baby intellectual, and as such I was often the youngest in a group of people more than +10 years my senior, sometimes more. I dated a few of these chums, and hey, here's a hard truth: Because of this I had no concept of boundaries. These grown-ass adults thought they were doing me a favor by pretending I was a responsible adult with the same experience as them.

 I let myself be hurt by a lot of dudes who were interested in me because I was a gullible teen girl, not because of my wise-beyond-my-yearness or my ~mature~ interests. This was a cycle that continued until I very suddenly realized I was in an exploitative relationship and broke it off. One of the mature older handsome guys I had dated proceeded to through a middle-school sized tantrum, spread a lot of hurtful lies about me and forcibly ousted me from this friend group.

So then I was stuck having to rebuild my social circle from the ground up and actually focus on myself and who I actually was, rather than the person I was pretending to be to impress adults.

I got fucking lucky. I got into a new friend circle fairly quick full of incredibly supportive people. I found a new bf who, while older than me still, was incredibly patient and respectful of me and FULLY AWARE OF WHAT THE AGE GAP ENTAILED! He would constantly ask about my comfort level and make sure I felt safe until he had it fucking memorized. He helped me get past a lot of my stunted maturity issues and we're still together today, supporting each other and being fairly functional adults with our powers combined.

Nothing makes me absolutely sadder than hearing ""Oh, I'm very mature, people never treat me as a kid!"" because that could not be farther from the truth. Maturity isn't people knowing how to treat you, it's knowing how to treat yourself."
"As someone raised by a borderline parent, please do not underestimate the severe psychological damage that they can do. Get her into treatment *immediately*. DBT has to happen. Have an open dialogue with your children where they know that they can come to you about anything. Don't assume that just because what you've seen has been okay that other things aren't going on behind closed doors, or that her being okay with young children won't turn to emotional abuse as your children become older and their own individualism becomes more present."
Who even rates women on a numerical scale? You are an objectifying asshole and she should break up with you after saying all that bs to her. Poor girl. Apologize and stop saying mean shit to people you supposedly love. 
"This sounds like it could be written by my partner, down to the last detail.  Like you, he is in therapy.  Same diagnoses as well.  He works in the same industry, and I'm completing a Masters by next summer.  I work full time but rely heavily on his financial contributions for living expenses.

From a woman with your girlfriend's perspective: 

It's been insanely difficult on me, because I do love and support him unconditionally, and I can see a beautiful future for both of us if we stay together.  Every day that he struggles with whether or not he feels the same hits me like a new rejection.

I know him well, and often wonder if he can't stop thinking about other girls simply because he hasn't made the choice not to.  As long as he leaves that door open, he could have any future, with any girl or number of girls coming into his life, not just me.  If he just made the choice to shut those doors, to choose a single future and *stick with it*, I genuinely believe he would be much happier. 

Right now, so much of his energy is going into a dark and uncertain future where he imagines starting over (yet again) with a clean slate (yet again).  I do know one of the things that has kept him here so far is the suspicion that, if he leaves, he will find himself realizing that he did give up something he will mourn forever, and perhaps never truly get over.

I've been there myself, before.  It's not an easy choice, to give up all other futures forever, and not one I can make for him.  All I can do is patiently wait until he either comes to the realization that his turmoil is stemming from agonizing over the commitment itself - not what the commitment brings - or can't stomach it and leaves.

I do hope, for both of your sakes, that you are soon able to arrive in a place mentally where you can make this decision either way. 

Best of luck."
"I think it is very likely you are more flirtatious than you realize.  I used to date a guy who got hit on all the time and he was attractive but not insanely so.  He was, however, one of those people who has never met a stranger and would talk and engage with anyone.  He was very approachable.  It did not generally bother me as I got hit on quite a bit as well for the same reason and definitely not for my looks.  But I'm not sure how to tell you to turn off that approachable and flirty vibe you are probably giving off as I've never bothered to try.  "
"The casual sex isn't the issue at all, there is no casual sex. OP's  brother doesn't do casual sex he meets girls and makes them think he wants a real relationship with them...then he cheats and ghosts then while laughing. If he was just going out and getting laid and being clear that it's just a ONS or fuckbuddy thing no one would be getting hurt but he isn't doing that because, it sounds like, he enjoys getting the boyfriend experience even though he doesn't value it."
"On the one hand, I believe your anger is partly justified. Your step-mom is in her thirties and should be old enough to not be doing juvenile crap like kicking items around. These type of people are bound to make accidents and injuries happen more often than mature adults who pay attention to how their actions affect others. So I can understand why you're upset! 


On the other hand, as long as it was an accident, you should try your hardest to let go of your anger and forgive your step-mom. If you were being goofy and kicking some props or toys around and **totally** by accident hurt someone, wouldn't you want them to forgive you? You would probably also feel really terrible about the situation even if they weren't mad at you at all. 


If I were you, I'd just try to imagine yourself in her situation and understand that it was a total accident. 


But this is important: did she at least apologize and see if you were okay?"
"I was in an abusive relationship when I was your daughters age. My parents had no idea he was abusive because I hid it very well for fear of ""looking dumb"" because I loved him and wanted to stay with him. He may have done terrible things you don't know about. Love your daughter, let her know you will never judge her harshly and will listen if she needs to talk. Even if she can't talk and you just hold her when she is upset that can help. Its really nice to see you care so much about her. This may take a long time to heal (took me years) but I wasn't actively in therapy at her age. She may eventually open up but it can take a long time. Stay loving and supportive. I'm so sorry for you both but again I want to impress its really lovely seeing parents who care. She has a good support system, she'll make it through this :)"
Reporting is traumatic and she will get fuck all justice because it's unlikely they will confess. Even with the most solid evidence rape cases rarely end with prosecution. It would be revictimised the girl for no justice. 
"Everything in her update, which is what I was replying to, was extremely direct.

1. She blocked him on everything, no half-measures or softness.

2. She explicitly told people she lives with to beware of him.

3. She has a plan to call the police if this escalates (which is hard to do on someone you used to consider a friend).

About the only way to be more direct going forward is to give a No Contact announcement (which frequently triggers escalation), or file for a no contact order (which can require revealing her address)."
"""I begged and groveled and did it his way.""

Big mistake.  You should be with someone because you enrich each other's lives, not out of desperation.  Please work on being happy and satisfied with yourself, with your own life.  This is the priority here.  You shouldn't desperately need anyone."
"Once both parties are over 25 or so, I feel like ethical age gaps are a lot more flexible. People ten to fifteen years older can more easily be peers. "
"I want you to remember that you are in charge here. Not her. The buck stops with you. If you don't, you're going to have a hell of a time in the years to come because your daughter will end up playing the three of you against each other. 

The next time MIL starts with anything. Put your hands up and say, ""Stop. This stops now. I've asked you to respect us and you won't. I am no longer willing to give you any more chances. This isn't a warning. You're on a time out. We'll talk to you after Halloween. We don't want to see you before that. If you disrespect my parenting again the time out will be two weeks, then a month. Understand? Goodbye. 

The first time you use your shiny steel spine it'll pinch a bit but afterwards you  stand a little taller."
"Sure, but...right now he's put *you* in the really uncomfortable position of negotiating this wedding role with a sister you barely know. Why does his discomfort with the phone outweigh yours?"
"Make it very clear that she must be invited over. It's  not appropriate to ""pop by"" unannounced. Your husband should be the one to set this boundary, and he needs to present it as a united choice. Not ""my wife says X, sorry mom."""
"There have been a few times I've driven home after a sleepover and stopped for casual food. Sure, it may be 10am on a Sunday but if I'm going to waffle house, I'm not going to apologize for my appearance (within reason). "
"You guys got together when you were 19 and he was 32? And had a LDR for those first 3 years?

The naivety here is palpable. This is not a healthy foundation for a relationship, especially given this odd behavior of his."
"You know when you eat something really delicious for the first time and then you have it everyday consistently for a while before you eventually tire of it? Maybe that's how he's feeling with his recent discovery of porn. 

That being said, he's being pretty disrespectful. Bring it up with him without trying to tiptoe around his feelings. "
"Dude, your family sucks. They treat her like shit, and they don't want anything to do with her, so why she should put any effort for them? 

You gotta be a better partner and realize that she needs to be a priority over them, or you're gonna lose her."
I think everything you've got to say is valid. If OP wasn't barely legal and this man wasn't almost 30. But since that is the situation here the bigger concern isn't that they both feel safe. It's that a teenager is safe around a dude who is 10 years older than her. Because that is unbelievably creepy. There are very few reasons for a 28 year old to be pursuing an 18 year old. The main one is typically that he can't get girls his own age and therefore has to pursue girls who don't have the sense to know better yet.
Isn't this the opposite meaning of the original blood vs water proverb?
"I'm curious if this situation was a guy saying his female roommate cut off the fwb dynamic they had and the guy hurled abuse stomped around and wanted to break her things would you say to the guy ""You're not crazy your awesome!!""?"
Quitting my job is the only solution she has suggested. Combining that with her not accepting any of my ideas and offering no other ideas of her own makes me believe quitting is the only option she agrees with. 
Do not move in together unless you're equals.
"He seems like the ""real deal""?  He's going to ""seem like"" anything you want him to, so he can get in your pants when he wants to."
"/r/raisedbynarcissists

You need to move out as soon as you can manage it logistically.


I'm sure I don't have to tell you that most sane parents would be absolutely horrified this happened and would want you to be ok- not making fun of you for being afraid.  Jesus. 

If there's a counselor at your school, go to talk to him or her about what happened.  You can also call therapists in your area and see if any of them will see you on a sliding scale fee (and they aren't even allowed to tell your parents you're seeing them, let alone what you're talking about, so don't worry about that).  

Time is going to help you feel better, but talking to someone- that's going to *really* help.  I'm so sorry your parents are so awful.  The good news is lots of wonderful people came from truly awful parents, and go on to have amazing lives.  You can be that person, too.  Good luck."
"&gt;  It just seems like a silly thing to dump him

It's also a silly thing to lose you over, but he's not concerned with that?"
"This was my first thought as to what happened. Either she reconnected with an ex or wasn't over him yet. Sometimes when people open up emotionally it opens them up to EVERYTHING. 

I also agree with another commenter that if it's not this, it's that she spent 6-8 hours opening up and OP couldn't keep up so she cut bait. Some of us who really value emotional transparency can get discouraged when we are the only ones putting ourselves out there. "

This is your comment a few hours ago to the above thread, ""There is nothing wrong with lusting after women. It's part of being a healthy man."""
"Holy shit.

That is rape, and it is common? Christ, get away from him, and report him to the police. That is absolutely not ok."
"It is tough. Then again, it is tough to spend your whole life 20 pounds underweight, constant maintenance, etc!"
"What form of contact is it acceptable to tell your grandchild she's your ""last priority"" again? Is that a semaphore thing?"
"&gt; If you where in this position would you take back the person if you felt like they where the one.

no, sorry

Also, there's no ""the one you're supposed to be with"". There are billions of people in the world and you're compatible with millions of them."
"No, it's unfortunate that what went from a celebration of the couple and a way to assist them starting their life together turned into a pissing contest with whoever goes the most in debt being the winner."
Just post here if you get worried his hotness is distracting you from red flags. We'll set you straight :) 
"Well, firstly, because people don't react well to that kind of aggressive / passive-aggressive behaviour (interrogation!). If he's going to speak to her then do it in an adult way.

Second, all that we know is that they met up. That doesn't mean she cheated. Yeah, sketchy, but that's all we know. Again, your approach doesn't gel with this."
"There are people who do some of the planning before the engagement or even before finding a partner (buying a dress they love but are afraid they'll never find again if they pass it by; reserving a high-demand venue 2 or 3 years in advance, etc.)

Anyway OP's fiance didn't plan anything.. but the fact that he's saying now, right after getting engaged, that he FOR SURE 100% NON-NEGOTIABLE wants a LOTR wedding, it means he DEFINITELY came to that conclusion before asking OP to marry him. Especially considering he's not willing to budge at all, he should've disclosed this to her ahead of time. "
"Your toddler and I have the same ""just got home"" habits. 

That is a possibility I've never considered! I have no idea if she's with grandparents or in daycare when her mom is at work, so it could be a build up of a whole day/night's worth of cries. "
"I was going to add that I tend to have things to show/discuss with SO when I can't so we've started using messenger or gchat or just texting stuff to each other. Like dog videos, grocery lists, dinner ideas. 

Buy a lock for your office door. Close it when you need to amd tell him that if he needs to reach you to message you and you'll get back to him when you get a second between calls. 

He needs to understand that for all intents and purposes, you're at work. Even if you're in the house. He's not going to drive to your job every time he has a thought. If he can't follow the boundaries you set, put up some physical ones. "
"This isn't in regard to the op at all, but I just wanted to say thank you for saying that. I'm going through some shit with my own father, and have been my entire life. I think some sense has finally been knocked into me. THANK You."
"I'm confused. Why does it matter so much how it happens? As long as she's satisfied in the manner she prefers, why do you care if it's not penetrative? This is a weird case of trying to fix a sex life that ain't broken"
If it had been some random 26-year-old man do you think your husband would have decided to part with $1700 just to help him out a little? Nah. You're letting him off easy here.
"I am so sorry this has happened to you, but throwing away your entire future because you can't yet process your grief is not the answer.  No-one should EVER make important life decisions when in the midst of an emotional crisis as you are.

Is your school (or parents) able to arrange grief counselling or therapy? This is what you need."
"So he's chronically unemployed, frequently fired, depends on you for money, repeatedly crashes or wrecks cars, and gets offended when he isn't trusted behind the wheel of the only vehicle that keeps both him and you out of poverty?  And then he throws little butthurt tantrums?

Oh joy!  What a sweetheart!  Girl, you best lock him down before somebody else swoops in and takes him away from you.  Like maybe the state will swoop in and take him away when they arrest him for manslaughter after his next accident kills somebody.

But yeah, don't let him drive.  You'll need your car when he's in jail so you can go visit him.  Plus, if you don't have a car then you can't work, and then who will pay his court costs and lawyer fees?  And if you're broke then who is going to add money to his prison commissary account?!?"
"That might be because you are still fixated on who he thinks is attractive. I'd do him a favor and just drop this subject. To him, it's dangerous territory. And if he didn't care about your feelings and your possible reaction, then he wouldn't be so diplomatic with you. Be nice. "
Appreciate your point. I know that I probably only inflamed it by conforming to their ideals and lying. Luckily they don't have Social Media and I haven't heard from then in over a week.
"Next time tell him you don't get it. Please explain the joke, what part was funny"
"No. 

Get out of this relationship and *stay* out of this relationship. He will continue to cheat and lie; he's proven this numerous times. You are unhappy and he is the reason why. You *do* deserve better, but that starts with you *demanding* better, and the first step to that is breaking it off *permanently* with this douchebag. "
"He is grieving and from the sounds of it, he's in the denial/anger part of it. He wants to blame something for the miscarriage, and so he pinned it on gluten. 

What he needs is to speak to a therapist specializing in bereavement and grief. And you need to talk to him about how hurtful he is being. 

Don't go through with the wedding until this is sorted out."
What if OP doesn't have a job and her parents won't let her get one?
"Speaking from personal experience... Sometimes friends will try to intervene when they need to butt the fuck out. I had a best friend that tried to split my husband and I up, because she was jealous of the time I was spending with him. She wouldn't accept it, so she and I parted ways. She wasn't willing to accept the fact that he meant the world to me and he made me happy.

Two of my husband's friends tried to break us up. One was mad his ""bro"" had a life outside of partying with him on the regular. I tried my best to be friends with him too, but he wasn't having it. His best friend was growing up and building a life and he didn't like that..

Second friend tried to sleep with me. He was also always commenting on how much time hubby and I spent together and couldn't stand it that my husband would rather stay in with me and watch movies that go out partying without me. 

Your friends will not always be there. They will find SOs or spouses and grow up and move on too. Would you expect them to ditch everything just so you guys could party like you used to? Or would you respect that that person was someone you cared for and now in a loving relationship. Your friends owe you that same decency, but if they are not at that point in their lives, they won't get it.

Truth be told, when shit gets hard, really hard... Your spouse will be the one by your side. Crying with you, sacrificing for you... You need to think about the long term. Friendships wane, but marrying your soulmate is for life."
"""But hes reasoning is that, hes proven he can have sex without porn, so I should let him have it because it wont affect him anymore. Hes sure that its not going to affect him or us in anyway. He thinks it'll just be a fun activity.""

No no no no no. Absolutely not. This is terrible reasoning, and insulting to you as well. He has to prove he can have sex without porn? What about a desire to have sex focused on you and him and your connection because you're his girlfriend and he loves you? Even ignoring that, a normal, healthy sex life is one where both people are happy and comfortable with each other, not where someone is just doing something for a while to prove that they deserve the thing they want. He doesn't get to decide it's not going to affect you, because it already is.


""I hate being controlling or being unfair so I tend to give in to things.""

Sticking up for yourself and holding your ground when something makes you uncomfortable or unhappy is *not* being unfair or controlling. But making your girlfriend feel bad and like she has to do something she's uncomfortable with becuase you've proved you should be allowed to definitely is."
You are so unhappy I couldn't even read all of that :( 
"As I recall she was staying with her friends, a couple who had helped her get her stuff, and he was texting her begging her to come home and then the texts degenerated into calling her a bitch and stuff so she blocked him, because the guys (her friends) said to at that point so he couldn't hurt her more."
"Unfortunately, I think adoption would also require his consent. If he's a controlling abuser, I wouldn't count on that because the baby is his ticket to controlling her for the next 18 years."
"Right? This is driving me insane. Just talking about how bad it is over and over and doing *nothing about it*. I get that it's a willpower thing, but at some point it gets hard to keep feeling sympathy. 

OP, ***do something about it***."
"It wouldn't be that thought out.  If there was a discussion about who needed company and she still insisted on going with him it'd be different.  This is just ""whoever is nice enough to drive me gets copilot help both ways""."
"Those conditions are not unreasonable, in my opinion. People might say you're being bought, yada yada, but delaying 2 years means you own your house free and clear, have no debt and can really enjoy life. I'd say it's worth the wait. "
"Fantasizing about people we know and spend time with is pretty normal. I think the main thing you need to address is is he certain he wants to continue a monogamous relationship with you. If he does, then the fantasies in his head can get as kooky as he likes."
"That's just poetic. I'm so so sorry you're going through this. I'm a wife and a mother and I cannot imagine doing this to my husband or my son. I wish I could hug you, OP and your kiddos. Just keep them at the forefront. Everything is about them now and everything you do and say will affect them. Be careful and be wise but not vindictive. They will see it all. "
"Yes, I second that you should look for a new job. It's going to be hard for yourself to go back and see your coworker regularly and your husband isn't going to like it either. 
I think you're taking the right steps to ""fix"" the mistake however if your husband decides at any point that he cannot forgive you, then there is not much that you can do to salvage the relationship. "
"&gt;I was going to leave the country to avoid child support. She is already in another long distance relationship.

Holy shit.


&gt;but neither of us would want more than weekends with our four kids ages 2-9.

Holy shit.

&gt;She has made them bratty and spoiled, won't let me discipline them and made them hate me

Holy shit.

&gt;She says that if I leave her and the kids high and dry she will hunt me down.

Holy shit. You are both super-duper fucked up individuals if this is true. 

Why did the two of you keep having kids? Didn't you realize you were shit parents before you had 3 more?"
"I don't think you're obligated to give this guy any kind of reasoning. If you ghost he'll think you're a bitch, if you say ""You're weird and clingy and overstepping normal social boundaries"" then he'll think you're a bitch. It's impossible to please these people other than to keep letting them make you uncomfortable. I don't think you did anything wrong here. 

And before people act like you're obligated to tell this guy what he did wrong because how can he change blah blah, you're not obligated. It's never your job to fix other people or to even attempt to get them to understand what about them needs fixing. 
"
"&gt; Chalk the year up as a loss

Eh, not a complete loss. OP learned to recognize when someone's not being emotionally honest with her; it will serve her well in future, after she ditches this dude."
She's an asshole.  You dodged a bullet. That's what you have to repeat yourself
Don't shit where you eat. Stop dating coworkers.
"I'm a FFXIV junkie, personally, so I know obsession and how fucking boring it makes you to everyone who doesn't share that interest."
"Please don't talk badly about yourself and put yourself down. This person does not determine your value and worth. You're better than this.

Also, I appreciate recognizing that there might be something else going on, but it's not your job to boost her self-esteem or grow her brand. It speaks volumes of you that you want to help someone who is pushing you away, but she's pushing you away. Just let it go."
"Yup. Where do you live OP?

In most places it is law that a LL must offer at least 24 hours notice for NON-EMERGENCY repairs and renovations (that is the case here in NYC). 

You may also consider looking into /r/legaladvice.

I've had legal issues with LL's and roommates in the past, and that sub was helpful."
You've told him that your relationship needs to fundamentally change and it hasn't. You even left and that didn't help. I really think it might be best for you to end it and focus on cultivating your own happiness.
"I actually have a friend who knows someone like this. IG photos went from interesting, fun stuff, to selfies, to CONSTANT, UNENDING selfies that she demands everyone look at. It's narcissistic, self-destructive behavior, but she is not gonna realize it until she loses a good number of friends..."
"My step father's mom was like this. I remember one Christmas we were doing pictures and she said ""Ok now one just with family"", meaning everyone but my brother and I. "
"Unfortunately, I don't think this is one of those situations where you will ever find closure unless they suddenly apologize. Your wedding is done, it's been what? A year now? Holding on to that anger does nothing for you or your wife.

I'm with you 100%, addressing it from you guys in the first place was the right call especially because you were paying for the whole thing. For them to hold their attendance temporarily hostage was a childish move. But at the end of the day....you got married, you have a happy life and a happy wife.

I say....keep doing what you're doing and just remain polite. Never give them a reason and while I also agree that the gifts don't make up for what they did...short of confronting them....which likely won't give you the results you want given their history...I vote to just focus on the here and now.

My in laws used our wedding as an excuse to get their children and grandchildren together, and instead of celebrating their son's union to me, they spent the whole time gushing over the grandkids and his sister who lives out of state. So much so that I shit you not.....they took her table to table to introduce her to OUR friends and family...at the same time we were making the rounds at the tables thanking everyone for coming out. :| Oh yes. In fact at one point, he (FIL) was doing it WHILE we were in the middle of taking a picture with a table that we had to tell them ""Hey, could this wait? We're trying to take a picture with the table here...""

It sounds cliche...but you just gotta let it go within yourself. That's all you can do. Don't dwell on the past, focus on the future. You can't change people who are like that and frankly....they're not worth that trouble. Just let them keep on chugging along imo and you just live an awesome life."
"&gt;Your brothers anger control issues

I mean, is it that bad that a guy stands up for his sister? I'd be doing the same if someone was talking shit like that about my sister. And he even did it at a place/event where some violence is acceptable. Sure give him a talk but I wouldn't say he must have anger control issues from this incident."
"That's not a small cut it's a festering wound. Right now it's the cleaning, and then if OP keeps the baby, She'll be the one staying up until 3 am with the baby, she'll be the one *doing everything* school runs, pta meetings, extracurriculars, homework, sick days, chores, *everything*. Her husband can barely tear himself away from his video games to feed himself!

Also it's ignorant to assume she can just throw money at their relationship problems until they're ""okay""."
Oh my god. He would be a fucking **hero forever** if he did that. 
"If she is afraid of conflict with the one person she's supposed to be able to get through it with, then yes. That means she is afraid of YOU and YOUR reactions. Trust me, I've been in her situation before."
She's essentially a child and he is a grown ass man. That's enough details for me. 
"Same, I never thought of it badly until the Internet jumped on it"
I would say that the fact that you have a high libido and you haven't had sex in four months means you're already incompatible enough to go your separate ways. The cheating just seals the deal.
"That's wonderful, it sounds like you have a really great family. My son was diagnosed with severe autism at 15 months old and was completely non-verbal until age 7.  Now at age 10, he never stops talking, is in regular classes and even went away to summer camp for a week this year.  So I have learned to never underestimate him and I have no doubt he can live and work independently someday, but I'm still financially preparing for any help he may need in doing so.  I guess that's mostly why I don't understand your boyfriend making the connection that saving money for him = doubting him.  Buying car insurance doesn't mean you know you're a driver who's going to wreck a bunch of cars, know what I mean? It's just that...insurance for the future.  And that's never a bad thing.  You sound like a very compassionate and responsible young lady, keep doing what you're doing.  Best of luck to you and your family!"
"&gt; lol. This is how I discovered my ex's affair, with her ""just a friend"" guy. We're now divorced.

Yea.. I mean.  Someone else said, ""people may have certain boundaries that you need to respect."" which, like, fine, but if your lover/sig other is concerned, there's nothing wrong with allaying their fears and demonstrating you're an honest person.  UNLESS you know they'll be pissed with what you're withholding.  It's a common cheater tactic to turn shit around on the accuser.  "
"&gt; I want to live somewhere where I actually have someone to talk to and he understands me and is on my side 100%.

Aka: You want to live with someone who will let you do whatever you want without consequence. 

Someone who thinks it's ok to physically assault his girlfriend during an argument doesn't sound like he's fit to be caring for a rebellious teenager. "
Always trust your instincts (your gut feeling) or you will live with regrets.  He's a lot older than you so liking pigtails seems to be in line with his desires.  People are very good at deceiving and manipulating another person.  I've been deceived by partners and it hurts as you only want to see the best in them.  When you wake up and realize red flags don't doubt yourself!  If someone made you FEEL a certain way and you're unsure about it then investigate that bad feeling and talk about it.  Your feelings matter and shouldn't be brushed off.  
"For real, it's really obvious that a lot of people are just skimming over the original post. It's not that she won't watch some shows, it's that he will literally mock her for doing so. There really isn't any backing up from that kind of emotional and verbal abuse. I really hope OP takes some of this to heart and realize things aren't this way in every relationship."

"This is really true, I've watched a friend burn through a 25k inheritance in about 4 months. Because they dont't think money is an issue any more they don't think about how theyre spending it because, hey, there's so much it won't matter if I spend a bit. But when it's suddenly gone and there's nothing to really show for it except bad taste expensive sneakers and regret, it can be really mentally damaging as well as financially irresponsible. "
"You don't get to tell her what she can and cannot wear. Jesus.  


Edit: the downvoting is super pathetic.  "
"I'm more interested in whether a person *likes* what they do. 

No one ever knew what Chandler's job was on Friends and they all still loved him. "
If you're already going to break up with her I don't see what good it'll do.
What on earth would you have to be grateful for? She sounds awful. How dare she tell you you can't have guests in your own home.
I'm sorry I nearly fell over laughing picturing dad jeans &amp; athletic shoes while branding himself as a hipster. 😂
"I don't have any problem with her financial habits. Like I said, I think she's fine with money. Yes, she spends more than me. But she spends it on stuff that lasts a very long time and she never spends more than we can afford. So I really don't care. I just don't think that a hard-and-fast rule of *only* $2000 is really what the limit is about. It's about making sure neither of us spends too much or makes a huge financial decision without consulting the other. 

And neither of us do that, anyway. I mean, I don't give 2 shits if she buys a coat for $2000. That really doesn't harm/benefit me in any way. But if she spent $2000 on a used car? I would care a little. And she knows that. Hell, we talk about $10 purchases if it's something like decor for the house or switching brands of toothpaste. Yes, it's under $2000 and ""technically"" fair game. But we're both reasonable adults and know that stuff like that should be discussed. Which is why I don't really see why this particular purchase is such a big deal to her.

We don't really ever fight about other stuff, beyond small bickering that is solved very easily."
Your gf is abusive. Dump her
Thanks for the update (I was very curious about the box). Glad to hear you guys are trying to make it work.
"Sex is definitely different from love, and a lot of people can healthily separate them in an open marriage. What she did was a full on affair. She willingly sent him into depression and fell in love with another man against his repeated protests. Please don't equivocate a healthy open marriage with emotional abuse, manipulation, and cheating."
"Pick your sister, and if your best friend asks (which she shouldn't, that's rude) explain that it's a family thing and you did it to keep the peace (even if it's a white lie.) Seriously, unless she's really heinous, she should understand. My best friend in the whole world is getting married and her sister who she's not close to is her MOH and I didn't think twice about it."
"You did NOTHING wrong.

He chose to threaten you. He chose to be abusive. He chose to break the law. You did not make those choices for him.

You did the right thing by protecting yourself and reporting a crime.

Get the restraining order in the meanwhile. Chances are he'll make bail and it's unlikely he's going to be put away for a first offense. You need to remain protected.

I would suggest your next move would be to get a therapist. You'll need emotional support and strength through this process."
"Come on, you know you can't do it. No matter how many times it will take- talk, talk, talk, talk until you reach something.

There is always option of sex therapy, maybe you need to improve things in bed? Ask her what SHE would like to do, focus the talk on her needs maybe... 

Good luck."
"This is a technique called gray rocking. Be repetitive, boring, and give her absolutely no footing. Be as boring and neutral as possible. You can do it!"
"You need psychological help.     

This is not how rational adults address problems."
And she ain't sorry. Get it gurl. 
I don't have the father's number and he doesn't use his facebook. As far as I am aware all other parents are being kept in the dark
"Start making more plans with friends and family and stop initiating plans with him. 

Don't invite him to do anything for a few weeks and see what happens. 

I think one of two things is happening here:

1) he's overwhelmed by all the invites from you and you are always making the plans so he feels like he doesn't have to. He's just being lazy. 

2) he's just not that into the relationship anymore and is pulling away slowly 

Ive been in your position before and I know how much it sucks! Hope it works out for you. "

"Everyone is different.

She should see a doctor if she has not already, bad pains can be caused by various things.

She might want to consider going on birth control, or changing the type she uses.

Other than that, a hot water bottle/magic bag are great to have (especially with the cold weather coming) - along those lines a hot bath.

You can suggest to her too, masturbation. I know it sounds really weird, and she will *not* feel very sexy about it, but the spasms of an orgasm are shown to help with pain from cramping (I also recommend this one from first hand ^(har har) experience)."

This is what I mean! He jumped the gun on it because he was already annoyed with me and started accusing me of being rude to the waitress because of a few seconds of pause. And then said I was acting like a spoiled child because of that.

You didn't mention how old this dude is, but if you want a serious relationship, then you are entitled to one. This guy doesn't want one with you, that's pretty obvious. "

[removed]
"This might be out of left field, but she might feel insecure about her job prospects.  What is her educational status?

I feel like I'm going to be crucified for saying this, but I can see how caring for one's family is a lot more appealing that being a cashier in a grocery store or a receptionist.  

How do you approach these conversations? Do you demand that she get a job, or do you go over your finances and ask her to help you find a solution?

Every family is different.  It may turn out that that what works best for you is for your daughter to work more hours and contribute financially while your wife watches your grandchild.  It might make sense for your wife to work, or even to return to school and then work.

There are lots of solutions."
"I know, right? 

I love these threads. "
"Honestly, at this point- I'd let him know that he needs to pay you back for the reservations you made and the hundreds of dollars you lost in deposits for the original trip.  

Then I'd show him these comments.  He needs to understand how unbelievably not okay this is- to everyone but him.  We're all in agreement here.  If this is his way of ending it, fine- but he needs to pay you back for the deposits.  If this is his weird, misguided way of proposing marriage- let him know you still need to be paid back for the deposits and you wouldn't dream of marrying someone who made unilateral decisions like this without you. 

Only you know what the rest of your relationship is like and whether this is a one-off or whether this is just one more red flag to add to your collection.  Either way, HE PAYS YOU BACK FOR THOSE LOST DEPOSITS.  This isn't a joke or a prank or some kind of game.  He pays you back.  Period.  "

By walking away. Is your culture more important than your own sanity?

&gt; He dotes on me and treats me right. It's a dr Jekyl and Hyde kind of thing. I am married to two completely different people.

Your husband is toxic. you should stop making excuses. Would you eat a sandwich with 50% shit in it? Probably not, so why would you stay in an unhealthy relationship like this? Your husband isn't going to change. Either you accept his behaviour and let yourself treat like this for the rest of your life, having no self-esteem whatever; or you leave.

Do you want to bring children to this mix at one point? Do you think this will be a healthy environment to grow up in? Certainly not."
"Because she heard screaming on the baby monitor and decided to wait, because she decided not to talk to her fiancé about the latest issue yet because a friend is in town, and because she doesn't seem quite convinced of the severity of the situation. "
Tell him you didn't ask him for permission and you're going and if he continues to disrespect your family he will be going (away) as well.
"I don't have any experience with what you are going through, but there is one thing you wrote that really stood out.

&gt;  Is the insane amount of work I've put into this relationship worth it at all?

This is known as the sunk cost fallacy. You have so much invested in something (in this case your relationship), that stopping feels like you are losing all of that. Here is that thing. Everything you put into the relationship is already lost. Going forward, you need to ignore the sunk cost. It is gone. You need to look at future cost and what you will get out of that.

&gt;  The goal here is to keep my family together if I can

No. Your first goal should be the health and well-being of your child and yourself. Do not assume that keeping your family together is the best way to achieve that.

&gt; I mentioned to him that I'd like to go back to couples therapy.

Yes! This is the only real chance the two of you have.

Ultimately, focus on what is best for you and your child."
Some people are just hung up on thinking sex is evil. Work on gaining financial independence and moving out.

"I looked up some details about how location history works. Apparently if the app is running in the background it defaults to the nearest cellular tower to save battery, which is also the least accurate way to gather location data. Guess where the nearest cell tower to my workplace is?

On top of that hotel.

Also found the note that he was so upset about. Definitely the hospital orientation thing. He thought I had intentionally written my sister's name on it to mislead, but the woman doing the volunteer coordination had the same name. It also had the street on it (conveniently ignored in the accusations), which would have only appeared in my location history that day and would have clearly shown the hospital. I had written October 7 on it but it looked like it said 21 cause my handwriting blows (I think. I'm really not sure what the date was about cause my orientation was in September &amp; I ended up not becoming a volunteer cause they wanted to drug test me and I'm not about to stop smoking the ganja for a volunteer position, but whatever, the rest makes sense).

I don't know why being able to point to the exact flaws in the logic and explain them makes me feel less crazy. I'm not telling any of this to him, but still."
"Yeah - there's a lot of accusatory language here that's better left out. Better to not pretend to understand why she acted the way she acted, because maybe she vacillated in her head about things without consciously trying to ""keep you on the hook"" or whatever."
"Even if you two YOLO it out right now, what trust is there? He lied to you about his age, and not just a few digits, but *10 years difference*. And that's on *top* of the huge age gap already. 

If there's no trust, what type of relationship do you even have? Even FWBs need trust to make it work. "
"The only thing that makes Hugh a jerk is that he was running downstairs and whining about his ex to Leslie while also seeing you. But that is where it stops.

He is not a jerk for deciding that he is not into you and properly ending it. You need to realize that. Maybe he used you for sex, but maybe he thought he'd be more into you than he was once you were ""together"" (I shiver even saying that because 1 week hardly equals exclusivity in most situations). I understand that you are hurt, but this happened months ago from what I can gather in your post. You need to move on. If his other partners bother you, find a new place immediately. You are allowed to move out whenever you want (with a 30-day notice) when you are month to month. I don't know what ""strict laws"" you're referring to.

In the future, maybe work on yourself in this regard. I personally like to take every failed relationship as a chance to improve myself. Try to step back and pinpoint what you may have done wrong. Based on the fact that he bailed on you after a week, combined with the way you're still acting months later, I get the feeling clinginess is an issue if yours. Try to work on that. You're 28 years old. You should be at a point where you can spend a week with someone without being heartbroken 6 months later."

It sounds like he doesn't even feel *that* bad about it. 
"Yes you're spot on about the emotional problems. We've only been travelling together for a month with two more to go and it's honestly exhausting trying to collaborate with her.  If I want to go somewhere and she doesn't,  she'll clam up and agree to come along, but direct passive hostility towards me or refuse to talk to me for the next few hours.  She says she'll work on changing but if things don't get better, I'll probably take this threads advice and bugger off on my own.  Thanks for taking the time to post."
"You just equated your wife to a bowel movement.

You need help. "
"Yeah, piggybacking off of this, my ex is a water engineer. We were together for nearly 3 years. He would talk about his job for HOURS and I still have zero idea what his job is. Something about water pumps? 

So yeah, I would listen to him when he spoke but I didn't have much interest. Which is fine! He didn't have much interest in what I did either. Doesn't make either of us the bad person."

"When I googled ""Dan Savage DTMFN"" (because I had no idea what it meant), the first hits (the only ones I read) were DTMFA."
"&gt;  I have ripped him off for no real reason or need.

Side note, but you really ought to talk to someone and figure out why you did this. You say you know it was wrong, you seem to be pretty well-off, and you seem to care about your dad and your relationship with him. So think honestly and without judgement, as if it were a really good friend who did this: Why? What did you gain from using your dad's money without his permission instead of using your own money? When you were standing at the pump reaching for your wallet, how did you decide which card to use? 

Giving your dad a reason for why you stole from him might help mend your relationship - this is after you've paid him back, apologized without excuses, and given him some time. Because when you're stolen from, especially by someone you trusted, then you feel like the other person does not respect you the way you thought they did. Even if it was a random person breaking into your car, you wonder *why me?* You wonder what you did wrong to deserve this. If that's what your dad is feeling, then it might reassure him if you can say that your reasons had nothing to do with him and everything to do with you."

"You are not over-reacting. You are definitely under-reacting. He has no respect for your things, your space, your health. No respect for you.

I would really urge you to talk to a therapist. They can give you the tools you might need to leave. 

As for your kids, you won't be letting them down. I guarantee they will be way more affected by growing up in a house with a father who abuses their mother, than in two separate dwellings. "
"Forgiveness is the freedom for you to move on. Forgiving someone doesn't even mean that what they did is ok. You can even choose to never see them again, and still forgive them. It's all about you letting go and not holding onto the things that are still hurting you."
Just take a vacuum in there and deal with them. 
"Lol, get her to clean the litter box. 'Not cleaned the shit? No time with kit!' 'Not cleaned the poo? No cat for you!' 'Clear up the scat, or get away from my cat!'

This may or may not be terrible advice. "
"Sometimes it makes a greater impact to have coworkers make recommendations as they're the ones you're supposed to work with on the daily, the ones who you communicate with for work. "
"Yeah, this is my thought, too.  He actually *is* attempting to compromise, but with tattoos, the phrase, ""I'll be okay if you only get a few small ones"" comes off as dictating what the other person can/can't do with their body, which is what starts the argument loop."
"Looks play a large role at your current age group because most aren't really thinking of long terms of things. The hot guy/girl majoring in underwater basket weaving is more appealing to date then the average guy/girl lining themselves up for med school. That's just how things are for most people at that age unfortunately.


I'm not sure how much you weigh but, have you considered working out and trying to get in shape? More important then how others feel about the way you look - you yourself being confident and happy with the way you look goes a long way."
But why would anyone even think there's a significant chance it could be an error or a mistake?  Has anyone ever lied to you about someone being dead before?  It's never happened to me.

"I'm not /u/pants_pants_pants, but I feel compelled to answer them anyways. 

&gt; What exactly do you expect her to do?

Not post Facebook/social media statuses of ""OMG I can't find a job this sux so much everyone is such an asshole woe is me OMG life is so unfair to me holy shit"", maybe? 

What does that accomplish? Seriously, that's not a rhetorical question. I'm not on **any** social media so I don't understand the appeal to it at all, but what exactly does someone get from airing their dirty laundry so everyone can see, other than pity and getting people to feel sorry for them/general attention?

&gt; Do you expect her not to be able to earn a living?

What? Why would you even ask that? How does ""I can't help this person who is posting status updates solely to complain because I won't refer someone like that for a job and they're not asking for help in any other tangible way"" mean ""I don't want her to earn a living""? How can you *possibly* connect those things?

&gt;  It's easy for you to just cast her aside and feel good about yourself if you aren't thinking about how she's suffering and how she's barely scraping by. It's not your problem, is it? You can ignore it. But she can't. Somebody is suffering like me and you can just move on because it's not convenient to you. That's fucked up.

Ridiculous. Totally and completely ridiculous. 

If the person /u/pants_pants_pants was referring to posted something like ""ARGH I can't find a job, does anyone want to go over my resume or go over some interview questions or something?!? I feel like I'm trying my best but another set of eyes/ears may help!"", they make it pretty clear that they would have offered help. 

But they didn't. Like you, they just posted to complain. Holy fuck, your **tl;dr:** looks like something a 12-year-old on tumblr would write, ""The world hates me and I find little reason to feel any differently about it.""

Someone who says ""I hate having to play nice"" when they're trying to find a job and are referring to people in general is usually, in my experience, an asshole in their day-to-day life. After your responses here, I'm pretty sure that's also the case with you. 

A lot of people are nice all the time, not only when they need something from someone. "
"A baby is way more of a commitment than marriage, just saying."
I was thinking this too. I've read some of the comments and I'm a bit shocked at how venomous they are. To be honest if you overhear your girlfriend moaning about you and all she can come up with is throw pillows and casserole then you're doing pretty well! 
"And it's super romantic that it doesn't really matter to him, but he'll be damned if he'll let you go without something that matters to you."
Yeah that's extremely inappropriate. Your boyfriend is right. 
"I think what lumpofcole was saying was that what her boyfriend did was even stupider.. It's not even a ""win at all costs"" move, it's simply a lack of respect issue "
"Ah, I see. I guess I can see why he'd think other places of employment would have a similar policy, but the fact is, most industries don't. "
"Actions speak louder than words. If he says he wants to stay together but doesn't want marriage and is out cheating on you, well...."
OP should know that many teens have vanished from the face of earth under these similar circumstances. They go out on a vacation they dont know well and never heard of again.
"She knows you're trying to be more than friends with her and she's obviously interested in you but doesn't want to move as quickly as you do. She can still express interest but say that she wants to consider you a friend *as well*. 
If she had just said ""I only want to be friends with you."" and THEN acted the way she's acting then that would be mixed signals. Instead she basically said she's interested but also wants to consider you a friend first. Right now you're trying to develop the sexual side without developing the friendship side, and she's trying to develop both because she already told you that's what she needs. 

You're ""confused"" because you are ignoring what she already told you. Women can flirt and want to progress toward a more sexual relationship without immediately jumping into it. Would you rather she didn't give you any signs of sexual interest at all? This is like if she gave you a piece of cake and you were pissed that she didn't give you the whole cake.

"&gt;I was hungry at some point in the middle so he (driver) stopped at a small diner type place which I really didn't want. I kept telling him, I don't want to eat this, let's just go a little further and find **something else**, but he refused and said we should just eat something quickly and get on with the trip.

I have to give it your boyfriend here, driving for road trips really take a toll on your body. He was likely tired and wanted to get the whole driving part over with, as fast as possible. You also said you wanted to eat *something else*, but didn't specify where. I'm guessing it went on like one of those scenarios where he asked where, but you said said ""I'm not sure."" That possibly played a part in his frustration. There's a lot of talk on Reddit that details guys getting frustrated when girls can't pick a specific place to eat.

&gt;This is where it gets relevant: the waitress came and I hadn't picked anything so when she asked me, **I stayed silent.** 

It's not what you wanted to eat, but there's no reason why you had to give the silent treatment to the waiter. She didn't do anything wrong, it's her job to serve you. At this point, you're just bringing everyone else down with you.

&gt;Finally he says if I don't eat, ""I swear to god I will cause a scene in here."" So I did end up just eating it but just felt horrible, and when we got home late last night he still stands by everything he has done and said.

Did you like the food or no? I mean, you said that you ate the food, so I'm going to assume it wasn't terrible at all--just not what you wanted. People here can say that you were *threatened* to eat the food, but were you really? Were you going to die after taking a bite? That makes me wanna believe you were being picky about all of this."
"&gt;this is some aggressive ""hard-to-get"" nonsense at this point.

No it's not. She's taking things slowly and she already explained exactly what she's doing. She said she can't get into a relationship without being friends first. You're not being a good friend if you're ready to just toss her aside because she isn't jumping into bed with you. If you don't want to be friends with her then YOU are the one giving mixed signals. "
You sound like a not-so-great person. I'm sorry you feel this way and I really think you should seek therapy to work out your deep issues.
"My son is nine. He's horrifically embarassed by boobs-the mere mention of them will make him blush to his fingertips! I don't think he's gay at all (though would be just fine with it if he were). He's just immature and finds sexuality and nudity confusing, which is perfectly normal at this age! Your older brothers are being real jerks about this, they are going to give your little brother a complex. "
I am making the attempt. The worry I have is that if he and I cannot come to terms on a compromise with the issue that is going on our relationship might have to end.
"Yes, I am.  12 years this past June.

And my wife knows that if someone asks me to keep confidence about something that doesn't affect her directly, that I will.  I would expect the same in reverse.

I would never keep a secret from my wife that in any way affects her.  That someone else happens to work in a strip club is one of those things that doesn't affect her in any way, and so if that person asked me not to tell her, I'd have no reason to, and no moral compunctions about it."
They're not submissive to you. They're just using polite speech patterns and you don't understand social norms. People frequently make statements in question form.

"Birth control aside, do you know his history well enough / have tests that his coming inside you isn't passing something else on ? 

I'd be worried about that more than anything since you're on Multiple BC. 

On to this  breeding thing he seems fixated on. You need to have a serious chat with him about where he really stands with this. 

Maybe it's like a fantasy that he knows is safe since you're on several forms of BC. Like, it's fun in fantasy but he really doesn't want it in reality ? 

The staying inside for 20 minutes would be annoying and should be discussed at some point also because that's excessive "
"Oh, *honey*...please stop lying to yourself.

You really REALLY wanted this to be a *relationship,* not just fuck buddies **OR YOU WOULDN'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT ANY OF THIS.**

It's OKAY to want a relationship--stop trying to be The Cool Girl.  

Also, sometimes you just get dumped.  Not a pleasant experience, but it's one that almost all of humanity goes through at some point.  It's OKAY to acknowledge it:  ya got dumped.  

If you keep telling yourself pretty, pretty lies you will keep finding yourself in these kinds of ""relationships."""
"&gt; Did she also email her bf and all those friends she told these stories to and put the record straight?

If she doesn't do this, I would not want to be friends with her and certainly not travel with her.  However, the fact that she a) spread lies about you in the first place and b) didn't offer to set the record straight once caught doesn't give me much hope that she will do the right thing."
"
&gt;You need to understand that it is terribly harmful for children to witness conflict or abuse in the home. Your child is learning that this is how men treat women. Seeing one partner belittle and torment another who is begging for leniency shatters the child's self esteem. So many adult children who grew up in dysfunctional and abusive households write in here saying that they wish their parents had divorced. I have never read otherwise here. 

I never even saw the abuse, I always just thought my mother was a very weak, shy woman and I have to admit I thought less of her, even when I was a child. My father ended up suciding when I was 8, and it wasn't until I was an adult that I realized that my mum is actually one of the strongest people I have ever met, she was just dealing with a really controlling, abusive, and manipulating husband (and the rest of his family) and she stayed with him because, well that's what women in Italy did at the time.

Even without seeing them ever speak badly to each other, I grew up feeling this undercurrent that men should lead the family in all decisions, and women should just silently do what they are told whilst running a household and their opinion mattered little. It wasn't until he died and I watched my mum come out of her shell and go on to not only lead our family through some very difficult situations, but have more normal relationships, that I got a more balanced, healthy understanding."
You have decent advice in there but a lot of your assumptions and assertions about domestic violence dynamics are way off.
"bc for OP's friends, it's easier to get OP to change than to get Chip to change."
"I mean, what the fuck man. You say that sometimes you are just an asshole, which means this is not a rare occurrence. Well, you can resign yourself to the philosophy that you're 'just like this sometimes' - or you can start to take a proactive stance on making change happen. You speak without thinking. 

You either keep believing that you're an asshole - and implicitly try to excuse yourself from your behavior and choices - or you start practicing some self-control. Also, I get that your SO isn't perfect, but **for someone who acts like objective hottness is not an issue, you seem to retouch on that fact that she is not a 10 a lot**.  

To apologize;  acknowledge how your words affected her, acknowledge that you have a bad habit, tell her you're sorry, then tell her what you're going to do about it to make things change. And if she wants to dump you, it sucks but hopefully it gives you motivation to make those improvements regardless. "
"One, its better for your child to have a relationship with people who actively want to be in their lives.  This grandparents thing is nonsense.  I wouldnt want my kid around someone who cant be bothered to drive 20 minutes to see them.

Two, you dont reward people that disrespect you.  The fact is your husband put himself in an awkward position years ago by putting up with this nonsense.  Yes, inter-cultural marriages are a pain in the ass, and yes there are all sorts of speed bumps you have to get over. 

Im not seeing a problem here.  Do you want to go over to their house?  I meant, you, not as a couple.  No? Dont go over to their house.  If they want to be in their grandchildrens lives, then they have to put in at least 10% effort.  If they feel theyve been ""insulted"" they have to actually say why as opposed to just stonewalling you.

Also, feel free to head over to /r/JUSTNOMIL if you need a ranting platform."
Apparent the OP's wife needed to. We aren't really talking about your family here....
"In a similar vein, is she deducting what your brother COSTS HER all these years from his inheritance?"
"&gt; I don't think he was ever really fine and he just dealt with it.

Which is utterly unfair to her. He let her live a lie for 4 years because he figured he could control her later.

Honestly, anyone deciding they can unilaterally change the dynamics of someone's life and relationship without discussion just because someone married them is in definite huge red flag territory. "
"&gt;  i don't think you're entirely versed on what marriage entails either. You're part of a team now.

Sorry, this is just plain silly. You are a team from the moment you become a couple. If there are expectations for this team, they are made known and enforced before marriage. You don't get married and than change the relationship rules just because. 

Traveling like she always has suddenly does not have more of a connotation just because their title changed. A marriage between two people should function like the relationship between two people. You got married **because** of the relationship, *not* because you thought somehow you can change it to be your way after. 
"
Knowing the terms and conditions of the things you are signed up for is part of being an adult. Ignorance is not an excuse. Leaving everything to the absolute last minute is not ideal and it's not surprising your boyfriend is anxious about that. You should have a better plan in place for paying your rent.
"&gt;I wonder why we even stayed together if he was not attracted to me.

But he is attracted to you. Am I missing something here?

&gt;It just seems so stupid that we would put so much work into being a family when there were countless other girls he was more attracted to.

You seem to be implying that people should only go after the people they are most attracted to.

Do you really believe that physical attraction is the most important thing? 

edit:

&gt; He says part of why I'm so beautiful is because I had his child but I think he is just saying that to make me feel better.

Why are you only believing the things that make you unhappy? Why are you choosing to believe he's lying about this?"
"Based on her behavior I wouldn't say she's an adult, at least not mentally. She gets ""hangry"" and starts making the trip miserable, her boyfriend pulls over at the first restaurant to shut her up, she immediately whines that it isn't the restaurant she wanted. Instead of sucking it up and ordering herself some food, she decides that nothing on the menu is good enough for her. Then when asked what she wants to eat, she gives the waitress the silent treatment....? 

This is cranky toddler behavior, and I think the boyfriend's reaction is justified. Presumably she acts like this all the time so he's probably sick of having to drag around an insufferable baby who whines that she's hangry and then somehow can't find a single appetizing thing on an entire restaurant menu. Of course since this is r/relationships you're gonna try to spin the situation around on the boyfriend and make him the bad guy."
"So 5 out of 7 days of the week you're the main father figure in the baby's life. I don't think you should have to accept some ""lesser"" title like the child calling you by your first name or something equally distancing. The baby-daddy might make things very difficult if his current bratty behavior persists through the years. What do you guys define as you ""interfering""? Are you to parent the child? To instill values? To have him confide in you? To offer advice and be the father at father-son activities? Or is all of that baby-daddy's territory? 

&gt;and as the baby gets older what happens will happen.

...yeah seems like all 3 of you sound unprepared. To use this sub's absolute favorite word, all of you need boundaries. You need to iron out your role, his role, and their co-parenting arrangement (no insulting texts from him, no storming out with the kid, etc.). "
"&gt;He doesn't believe that money is important to live a comfortable life consisting of food and a home

This has all my wuts....

Of COURSE he believes this because he most likely came from his parents home (where they supported him) to your home (where you support him).

Whilst you dont need to be wealthy to have a rich and fulfilling life you cant eat the contents of an empty wallet.

This guy is a parasite and the best way to stop him being that way is to shove him out on his own to fend for himself."

"1 - if that's his goal, he probably should have told his girlfriend of 4 years by now

2 - if he's as cheap as he sounds from this post and is funneling all his excess into retirement savings, he very likely already has enough to retire

3 - having a (secret?) long term goal doesn't make it ok to whine and complain all the time. Pushing expenses like warmer blankets onto his girlfriend who makes less and has more expenses is a really shitty retirement savings strategy.

We're such terrible communicators though, I worry that we wouldn't be able to open up to a counsellor. I won't know unless we try though I guess.
Thank you for your advice ."
She sure does sound very dramatic :(
Sounds like your girlfriend is actually the one who's homophobic.
"Nope, say goodbye to this fool.  He's totally into her and annoyingly ignorant of how all of this might make you feel.  If my boyfriend were to act like this, I'd be pissed.  Kick him out and let him beg for food at his ""crush's"" door.  Surely she'd reject his creepy ass as he deserves."
"This is batshit crazy. This woman sounds like she's a step away from being Glen Close in Fatal Attraction. Did she actually fly to your country to find you? Why is no one else commenting on how terrifying that is? She sounds dangerous.

"I definitely don't want to label your spouse, but I'm an alcoholic and one of the signs, for me, was an inability to stop drinking once I started. I simply could not have only one or two drinks.

"this users post isn't being ""easily offended"". It's giving OP the advice he needs. Clearly he is having no success with women - I'm willing to bet it's not his height that's the problem. 

He's clearly incapable of seeing women as having distinct personalities/human beings. He's posted several comments that demonstrate this, and it's been over a single online interaction. I can't imagine how this mindset must come through in real life. 

I'm so sick of this ""trendy"" stance people are taking that ""the world is too PC"". Boohoo, if you don't want to put some consideration into your words, then don't. I'm allowed to consider you an asshole for it, though.

Seriously and what if they were just two male friends anyway? I don't understand Jealosy I guess because I have a ton of male friends and I'm alone with them all the time. Never once tried to fuck any of them and never once have any of them ever hit on me. It's a little thing called respect and boundaries that jealous people see as a thin veneer that barely keeps everyone from fucking everyone constantly.

"Your parents need to take a hard stance.

If jordyn wants to cut off access to Mia until you are dealt with and she gets apologies all around (whilst she gets away with/carries on being a bullying manipulative *itch) then so be it.

Your mum needs to follow your dad's example. 
They can't allow her to run all of your lives using things as weapons (and using her own daughter as one is low) as she will just keep resorting to this whenever something isn't going her way.

Hopefully if your mum does as your dad does and, in a way, pulls back from Jordyn, Javier and unfortunately Mia either your brother takes action or Jordyn realises she has gone too far and that image of her being 'the daughter' in this family can never happen and reigns herself in.

I wouldn't hold out hope for either but it's a nice ideal resolution."
"This happened to me. I had to go and work abroad for a year and a month after I'd left, my partner of 4 years called me up and said he ""knew about everything"" (apparently 3 different guys I'd been screwing) and that it was over. None of it was true. But he told various different stories to everyone - I'd sent him a confessional email, he'd snooped my Facebook, that I'd been sending nudes indiscriminately (I don't send nudes ever, not even to him), that I'd been screwing my childhood best friend, some random guy from uni that I met about twice, and a waiter in a hotel I stayed at once (that was so random). It hurt like hell and the gaslighting fucked me up for a long time. Fortunately anyone that mattered didn't believe him. I loved him with all my heart and soul... yeah, I'm still not really over it. Especially since I recently moved back to the town where we got our fist home together... so many memories... and it was my first home after moving out of my parents' house too... anyway, I digress...

And I also have been through someone telling my current partner that I cheated on him with them when I didn't. It was my partner's best friend so it was really hard for him to decide who to believe. In the end he chose me since I have never given him a reason to doubt me, the only time we aren't together is when I go home early to get sleep for work (he owns a bar where I help him as much as I can, but he works evenings/nights and I work daytime in the weekend), and said friend was a druggie who recently got dumped by his long-term gf and was basically jel of everyone who was in a relationship. He went around stirring shit in his other friends' relationships too. He's not very popular now.

Anyway, just my experience. Hopefully it might be helpful..."
"&gt; The less you feed her here, the more uncertain she will be and the less ammo she will have. The more you feed her about how you feel and so on, the more closure she will have and you will have a fairy tale.

"Similar thing here. When my oldest daughter was 2-1/2, she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. When I called my (now ex)SIL to tell her, she said ""I knew she had that when you told me how much she'd been peeing."" Why didn't you SAY something? I could have taken her in for a test before she became unresponsive and had to be rushed in. 

So yeah. Please say something. "
"That's not normal.  

What does he do for work?  Does he not have to communicate with people?  Does he have friends?"
"I'd say it's a combination. Maybe he could be afraid of the big bad title of MARRIAGE, but as someone who just got married, yeah it's a big deal but it doesn't have to change your lives drastically. We are the same people, we just happened to get up in front of friends and family and say we will love each other forever. 

If he loves her, has a kid, and REALLY is committed, I can't see a legitimate reason he wouldn't want to marry her. If it's about money, just go to the courthouse. I'd wager is a different reason. "
"A lot of things on this sub that are breakup worthy are also the person's right. You technically have the right to cheat on your partner or never do housework or only take one shower a month.

It's also their right to judge you an asshole for it and dump you."
"Chiming in here from the itty bitty titty committee. I don't have huge boobs either but it's not a big deal. People still will find you attractive, in fact its many men's preference. You have nothing to be worried about. "
"&gt; they cared for each other, deeply. They weren't compatible and neither of them wanted to admit it

I went to this wedding this summer. He has straight up told me that he should have called it off - getting engaged happened, and then they just kinda sleepwalked along into all of it. From the outside, it's easy to see that they have nothing in common and are trying reaallllyyy hard to compensate for that fact. But I think when the newlywed phase is over, they will both be more honest.

Point being: staying because ""it might improve"" or ""we live together"" or ""we can't afford to move out"" are really really terrible reasons to stay, OP, and will have divorce-bells written all over them. If not in the distant future, then break-up bells in the near future. If you don't do it soon, you'll prolong it until you explode, and end up saying something you regret in the heat of the moment.

TL;DR - breaking up swiftly and kindly, like NOW, is the gentle approach - might suck in the moment, but it really is the best-case scenario "
"Dude, break up with her. This relationship isn't doing you any good. You need to start fresh with someone new."
"Oh okay. Then he's just insecure and has a terrible way of showing it. Up to you whether you can put up with it. Does he at least admit he has a problem, or does he try to make it your fault?"
"It also didn't suddenly escalate to that-- OP kept on drinking, to the point that she couldn't drive. She either didn't know or didn't respect her limits, then didn't contact her SO to maintain transparency, then slept in the same bed as another dude. Instead of leaving first thing in the morning, she stayed and had breakfast with him, then went home and lied by omission to her SO. OP definitely needs to come clean. "
"&gt; Because I don't trust that he's going to keep his word.

You want to marry someone you think is untrustworthy? 

Perhaps you need a reality check. "
"The kid has been in a tug of war between his parents for nearly all his life - screaming at you until you apologise might be one of the only ways of expressing control that he has. 

I'm sorry this is so difficult on you and your family. I think someone above had the idea of talking with his coach? That might help... "
"I would suggest not to find an excuse because people like her, no recognition, no regards for others, they always play the victim and will go far to get their point known by others.

If you say the gym excuse how much do you bet she'll magically show up at your place just to prove you are home? ;)

People like her love the attention.
Any way they can get.
Not saying your are stucked with her, but you will have to say a firm NO MORE RIDES without any excuses and try to deal with the other coworkers.

By not engaging in any way this discussion they'll probably end up realizing she's the problem source and it will die down with time. "
"I never cheated on him. It was before I met him. Never had any sexual interactions with others except for him after we started dating.
Trust is broken because I lied about my sexual past. Literally what I replied, but he thinks I was lying."
"Doesn't matter anymore, bro."
"Okay the problem I have with this argument is that it doesn't acknowledge that people build lives together regardless of whether they are legally married. If someone that doesn't believe in marriage also doesn't believe in any commingling of finances or codependency, that's a logical consequence of not believing in marriage. ""We might not be together forever, so I don't want to consign any loans with you, open any credit cards with you, purchase a home with you, share a retirement account with you, etc."" Fine. So you continue to rent with each person paying an agreed share of bills or establish a landlord/tenant relationship on a purchased home, you each pay into your own retirement accounts, you each have savings to cover your own emergencies, etc. This is totally logical to me if you don't believe in relationships lasting forever. 

But what tends to happen in long-term relationships is a creep of sharing expenses &amp; responsibilities, which is the same thing that happens in marriage. Unmarried partners buy homes together, cosign on cars, deposit paychecks into joint accounts, decide one partner will be a stay-at-home parent. The institution of marriage protects both partners in these instances so that the person assuming more risk won't be left with nothing in the event of a breakup, which is what happens to unmarried partners. 

So there's an argument to be made that relationships aren't fairy tales that last ""happily ever after,"" but there's also a practical argument that you're asking your partner to assume the same amount of risk in building a life together without offering any of he legal protections for doing so. "
"&gt;He has no desire to pursue other partners outside of me, 

So, it's a one-sided open relationship. You will soon find out if your boyfriend is truly ok with your outside relationships. "
You probably get what you pay for. I'll make you a custom suit for $40 but it will look terrible. 
"&gt; I've never been big on commitment. In fact, this is the first serious relationship (and the longest) I've ever had. Most of my dating history is made up of flings and casual relationships mostly about sex, and that has always been a conscious choice on my part. I enjoy my freedom and keeping things simple and carefree.

Maybe this was the ""true you"" in your twenties, but people change. You're moving into your thirties, being someone different than you were doesn't mean you're not being true to yourself, it may just mean there's a new truth."
"And your question is?

Oh, you don't have a question? You just wanted to list all the wonderful things you've done and reap praise from people who stopped reading before they get to the on the second part, where you admit to being controlling, angry and downright cruel throughout? Yeah, you sure took care of her - like Kathy Bates. It must have been downright terrifying for her, to feel so frail and powerless, and have the one person who was supposed to love her unconditionally treat her like shit.

And look, I would go easy on you, because you didn't sign up to be a caretaker and it's horrible drain on a person, and because watching your spouse go through something like that can be as bad as going through it yourself. I would, if not for the line ""I wasn't strong enough to be a warrior and a poet for her."" 

Please. No one needed you to be a goddamn warrior or a goddamn poet. You weren't strong enough to be self-sacrificing, without being kind of an asshole about it. Get that part right, in your own head if nowhere else, and save the melodrama for someone who gives a shit. That's my advice, although I'm aware that - despite this being an advice sub - you didn't ask for any. I half-wonder if you made this post just so you could show it to her. "
"S is recruiting you into the sex trade. Run straight to all of the adults. Do not pass go. Definitely do not collect $200. This is not going to have a good ending if you don't stop this from going any further. 

It's actually just happened where I live that a woman was caught recruiting and pimping girls at a high school. Do not let this be you or your friends. "
"He's refusing to speak to his daughter.

He's definitely handling it badly."
"I've been in this situation before -- my relationship started as an online relationship. I'm Belgian, she's Polish, and we met up for the first time in Lisbon for a 5 days city trip. That was about 1.5 years ago, and we're living together now.

Most people with LDR experience will agree that meeting up for the first time by traveling together is not a bad idea. It gives you the advantage of having ""neutral middle ground"". At this point in time, neither of you can really trust the other person yet, and meeting up close to one person's home makes it extra easy for that person to abduct you, lock you up, or whatever you may be scared about. 

Traveling is indeed risky (after all, you may ruin an entire trip in case the meet-up isn't as nice as expected), but safer than meeting in one person's home town.

In the end though, it does not matter *that* much. **All** meet-ups with someone you met online are risky, and OP should take caution no matter where or how she does it."
"&gt;  I said naa, it sounds dumb, and she argued with me for about two fucking hours about it.

This is a subtle, but important distinction. I know this, because I've had this exact thing happen to me about once a month for the past 15 years.

Is she arguing that you and she should have an open relationship? Or is she arguing that open relationships aren't ""dumb?"" I am more than capable of arguing endlessly in favor of a position I don't agree with, if I think the other person is simply dismissing the idea without thinking about it. 

You might ask her that. Either way, you might let her know that, regardless of the arguments for or against open relationships, you don't want to have one.

All that said, It's very likely that everyone here is correct. She either is cheating on you, or has someone she wants to cheat on you with. One of these is a major problem, one a lesser problem."
I've had a few boyfriends who live with female room mates. It's really not an issue for as many people as you might think. 
"What an incredibly condescending thing to do to someone. Instead of giving them the opportunity to *not* act irrationally or with jealousy, you purposefully prevent them from having any real agency in the matter at all. So they're basically found guilty of something they weren't given the chance to act on. "
That's completely  unnecessary. 
"&gt; Also I'm a dude

Fucking duh, if you were his sister he would treat you completely differently. 

Look, my boyfriend had a buddy like this. Mike was a great friend to his male pals - always had their backs, always down to chill, etc. Mike was a ""great friend"".

Except he cheated on his girlfriend All. The. Time. Me and all the other guys' girlfriends knew he was absolute dumpster trash, but the guys in his special little sexist golden circle liked the way he treated them, so they never called him out.

Your brother is Mike. You are getting special treatment because you are a man and his family, but the guy your brother is to you is separate from the guy the rest of the world sees. The rest of the world sees a selfish two timing dickhole, and you are his brother. I would steer clear of dating any guy with a weasel of a cheating brother like that. No thanks, not interested. Too much drama potential.

Also eventually all of Mike's friends starting seeing him less, because they became uncomfortable with how he treated women he claimed to love. Your brother is an asshole, just because he's nice to YOU doesn't change that. You may lose your girlfriend over this and I can't blame her. It isn't your fault he's an ass but you don't sound all that disgusted by him either. Your post is all about your GF having a problem with it. Your brother treats women like garbage, how can you even stand to be around him??

Edit: mobile, spelling."
"Using the hall pass is a bad idea.  Your bf probably gave it to you expecting you would never use it.  He would probably just look at your using it as a betrayal of trust even if he cheated first.

If you really want to use the hall pass I would talk to the BF again and give him time to process that you actually intend to use it.  I bet he would not be okay with it."
You seriously need this answered?
Protecting her doesn't mean forcing her to report rape. It means getting her medical and psychological treatment. It's important to empower and respect her no to reporting as opposed to stomping all over her desires and opinions like her scum bag ex. 
"Just because it's a joke doesn't mean it's not cruel or manipulative.

In the moment it didn't feel like a joke."
Maybe you didn't get invited because she dislikes you as much as you clearly dislike her?
She needs to read Dan Savage's columns on coming out to homophobic family members. She should wait until she is no longer dependent on them. 
"Tell your parents and hopefully they can go with you to tell your friend's parents.  Talk to your school councillor.  Tell them about your classmate.  

This is not 'snitching' or 'tattling', this is serious. As a teacher, I would always ask little kids (who have a tendency to tattle on their classmates) if they are telling on their friends to get them into trouble or to get them out of trouble. In this situation, you would be telling to get your classmate and your friend out trouble.  Serious, life-altering trouble.

You are smart enough to realize that this situation is not at all as was presented to you.  Men do not pay thousands of dollars for coffee or dinner dates with teenagers.  This is 100% sex trafficking with shady men.  There might be even some organized crime involved. So please, tell at least one trusted adult about this."
"Whenever it happens, purposely or not, he gets into the ""see! You do it too!"" bit 😞"
"True. It's all about realizing the fact if she's actually productive and NOT being toxic. She's clearly a toxic person and the best thing to do for you is to move on. You know what they say - plenty of fishes in the sea. You obviously deserve a better person, my friend."
Have you actually spoken to an attorney about this or are you just guessing?
"You get over it and stop being an asshole. And NEVER tell someone who they can or can not talk to. Get over yourself, dude.

If you're that worried about a girlfriend speaking with another male, you need to figure out why you are so insecure with yourself.

Also you should avoid drinking (not only because you're only 16 years old), but because it's likely you are a violent drunk and you may actually follow through with it next time."
"I'm just as confused as you are as to what he's upset about - specifically because he hasn't been an adult and plainly told you what his problem is. He's acting like a petulant child instead of your husband of two decades.

Don't tolerate the antics. Let him know when he gets home that you expect a grown up conversation and if he can't do that then sleep somewhere else until he can. When he does fess up about what the problem is, be empathetic but don't cave to unreasonable demands. You've done nothing wrong, so if he's having some kind of turmoil it's something he'll need to work on himself."
"I did this to a guy once. The day after an awesome first date, my ex texted me and we ended up starting to talk again and then getting back together and I never really followed up with the first date guy. . . I can't even remember his name to find him in my phone.   

Life happens.  Just be happy you had a great date.  "
"This is a really interesting post, thanks. 

I note in your post you said that she 'gave herself up' and in a later comment you say that you 'forgive her'. There are a few things that you need to realise before getting back with her:

1. She did nothing wrong. You were broken up (whether or not it was a 'break' really is irrelevant). 

2. A woman does not 'give herself up'. She slept with someone when she was a single person. This is entirely appropriate. There was no 'giving up' of herself. 

3. You cannot 'forgive her' because she did nothing wrong. In fact, starting a new relationship with her on the basis that she is 'forgiven' is absolutely the wrong way to go about it, because in your mind she has done something wrong and you have been magnanimous enough to see past it. She's done nothing wrong, and you are not being magnanimous.

At the end of the day there are a few relevant questions - does she make you happy? Do you make her happy? Are you better people because you are together. If so, you need to recognise that this is your issue, move past it, and get back together. But do it for the right reasons, not because you think you have 'forgiven' her. "

"Sorry I was a dick, princess, but I bet you won't do that again"
To be fair it does look to an outsider like you've been cheating on her. If you can't talk to this person and sort out disagreements without lying to her why are you with her?
"You may be right?  I have no idea. I don't personally think I'm unattractive at all.  If you google size 12 that's basically my body type.  I'm not skinny, but I'm not fat either.  Shrug.  The point is, he did not have to pursue me in the first place if I don't float his boat.  He did though.  If after the first time we had sex he found me too heavy, he could have easily broke it off.  But he didn't.   I haven't gained ANY weight since we met.  So I don't think it matters if size 12 is attractive or not??  It is what he originally chose, so telling me NOW he finds it unattractive is just plain stupid."
"Sounds like he went back to his ex? If it were me, I'd ignore him like it ain't no thang and tell him to kick rocks the day he tries to talk to me again. But that's me. "

"It's crazy that he would be mad at you for this, you're doing him a favor every single time! It's nice to pick him up if you're available, but it's not your job, and it's not like he's a long lost relative from across the sea that needs a welcome committee. 

A text when he lands so you know when to leave home is super reasonable. "
"This is exactly right. OP's boyfriend could very well be getting reimbursed for nonexistent cab rides and pocketing it. Meanwhile his actual driver, OP, gets nothing but a headache. "

"men can only treat women well if they pretend they are their daughters, sisters or mothers. duh!"
"Lol. It hurts a lot.  ""a tiny thing"" HA."
"I disagree with the second chance. Maybe it was early on and she knew that he would be going overseas, but the following four issues is why I disagree:  

1. She requested that the relationship be exclusive, yet continued to cheat.  

2. She continued to cheat after the plans changed to him coming home for a week once a month.  

3. He will forever wonder if she will excuse cheating if he has to be out of town for a bit.  

4. She did not come clean about it. She lied and lied and hid it from him and never came clean. He found out himself so he now won't ever really trust her because he knows that she is perfectly willing to fuck some other guy and then lie to his face."
"Yeah the first step in ""fixing"" this would be to own that you made a mistake and hurt her, OP..."
"Or more likely, they're not sold on her half-hearted attempt to patch things up. It would've been different if she said that when she was rejecting their very generous offer. Now it just sounds like she suddenly found time for them. "
"And that is different from the behavior of a normal college student how? 

You need to have college student expectations. Most college apartments are not the pinnacle of cleanliness. You can certainly sit down and tell her you are feeling domestically overwhelmed and ask if she can help more. I mean, honestly roomates of all ages have to have those conversations all the time. 

But it is entirely possible her answer will be ""Im already overwhelmed too and I don't mind a little mess"" or ""Sure of course I'll try to help!"" but then she drops the ball frequently. Because she is a college student just learning to live on her own. 

My point is that you should have that conversation, but don't convince yourself you are a martyr or make her feel like a child. She is a college student. You have had a few years in the workforce and learned to manage your time better. She sounds like she has a good head on her shoulders. She'll get there. 

Also, maybe cut yourself some slack. Maybe you need to pkay a videogame or watch tv from time to time and let the dinner dishes hang in the sink until the morning. "
You got a real winner there.
"&gt;He has claimed that I am ""too hard"" on him when we have sex, but I disagree.

I don't.

I mean, open conversations about what you each find sexually satisfying can be a positive thing. Constantly berating him while you're in the act itself cannot be fun for either of you (unless you're into that, which clearly neither of you are)

At some point you just have to acknowledge that you aren't sexually compatible. If you're honestly convinced that he's not even trying, what's the point in continuing?"
"This is true. I'm putting too much on OP.  Ultimately you have to take care of yourself first. Focus on your studies and your own mental health so you don't get dragged down by your sister and your parents. They are adults and responsible for their own decisions. 

And when the baby is born make sure you don't end up being the babysitter so the sister can keep up her partying ways. See that too often on this sub. "
"It's not ""already so bad."" OP just hasn't had a chance to come down yet. It's not lingering. It's not unusual. She just has a shitton on her plate after a scary situation. If she *wasn't* reacting like this it would be a bigger concern. "
"Yeah, it's still going to be awkward to all our friends though. Maybe after I stop seeing her she'll get the memo, but I'm kind of out of options. Thank you for the advice!!"
"&gt; He insults me and tends to pick on my son, but, over the past few years, i've just gotten used to it.

Your husband is an abusive bully and your son is suffering. I think you've become numb to this as a consequence of the abuse you've also suffered.

&gt;  But Mickey was more shocked than I was and has been trying to keep Jessica away from her father. He (Mickey) even told me that what he did wasn't right.

Your son is trying to protect his sister from his father, at his own expense. 

It's time to go, OP. You know this is bad -- you don't discipline three-year-olds by jerking them by their clothes and growling at them -- or you wouldn't be here.

If you want a relationship with your children past the age of 18, you'll do what you know you need to do now."
"I'm in my 30's and I've seen this happen a million times for both sexes.  It's hard to walk away from infatuation and really good sex.  She will most likely reach this conclusion on her own.  The best you can do is state your case and list examples of his behavior and then leave it to her to figure out.  

On the plus side, this will be a great learning experience for her.  She will be better able to zero in on this type of behavior for future relationships.  It will most likely run its course.  As long as she doesn't get married and/or knocked up, this will fizzle out with no real long term damage. "
"my gf and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary together at a wedding on New Years for someone I've never met and she barely knew. 

We had a great time. Danced, mingled with strangers, We had a great dinner, dessert, open bar, all free, stayed in a hotel and had a free shuttle... we celebrated basically strangers love and our own more privately. 

My point is you could still go to the wedding and celebrate your own anniversary"
"I don't see why anyone's giving you crap. Your best friend acted straight up sketchy. Why would anyone choose to ride for 6 hours with their best friends boyfriend over their own best friend they don't see a lot? 

This girl didn't zone out, she chose to ride with the boyfriend. People are a lot less innocent than Reddit thinks. Reddit always goes for innocent till proven guilty/OP is over reacting/etc. but if the OP posted that she was the one to get into her friends boyfriends car, Reddit would call her out for it. It's just one of those annoying developments on the social norms of Reddit. 

Either she a) has a little crush on your bf (which she probably does) and wanted to ride back with him to live the fantasy out/be near him instead of having to be in a different car all sad for 6 hours, or b) she wants to steal him, or c) she thinks they're best friends now or made some kind of ""connection"" with him in the car. 

It's okay for her to have a crush on him lingering from high school, it's not okay to act on it and try to spend time with him over you. "

"A 15 year old is still a child. Yes, you might have had breasts and a period, but you were not a woman. He was attracted to that immaturity - both the physical and mental immaturity but ESPECIALLY the mental one.

Like gooddaysunshines said- he's probably found or is looking for another young teenager that he can mold into what he wants.

At the moment though, you're free and surrounded by guys in your own age bracket, 18-22. Join a club or two, chat with people in your classes. "
"Just a note: body dysmorphic disorder isn't just being a bit self-obsessed or concerned with appearances. It's a serious anxiety disorder which has a huge impact on people's lives and mental health. I appreciate you're trying to be helpful, but the 'spend time with people who have serious problems' thing is often really unhelpful for people with BDD, increasing the feeling of shame because it reinforces the idea that their problem isn't 'serious' or 'real', or just down to vanity. It's a really tricky thing to deal with, and associated with a lot of guilt and shame, sadly."
"You seem pretty self-aware. You're already looking into therapy and counselling. I think you know what you need to do to fix this and you're already doing it. 

I don't even think it's at all productive to cast judgment on your actions when you're already judging yourself more harshly than any internet stranger can.

"Yeah, but when you're driving someone else's kid you just don't do it at all.

Same as you don't break the speed limit because ""I do it all the time, and it's no big deal, and it was only a little bit, and I can handle it.""

Same as you don't just smoke ""A tiny bit of weed, for my aching back ya know, it doesn't affect me that much anyway.""

Because if you do any of those things and there IS a fatal accident (even if it's not your fault!) you are automatically the biggest piece of shit in the universe.

Coroner's reports don't say ""There was a teeny tiny amount of alcohol in his system, not enough to affect the driving of a grown man, and we've interviewed friends and family who say that's nothing for a seasoned drinker so our findings are this definitely didn't have any influence on the outcome.""

Nah, they just say 'Driver involved in car crash. BAC positive for alcohol consumption that day.' and everyone else goes ""Oooooh, he drank too much and drove.""

I'm sorry but what? Why does his past matter at all to you? Is he not with you and proven that he's loyal, faithful and supportive to you? People come with baggage, that's just the way the cookie crumbles man. Like others have said, you're doing yourself and especially him no good by getting this worked up about something that you had absolutely no control over. Let it go."

Delete him! Why can't you delete him is what I'm curious about. Are you trying t leave a door open or...
"&gt; How scary is it going to get?

About a month ago I tried to leave, and he tried to restrain me.  He had been yelling at me for hours and I just couldn't take it anymore.  I was scared and angry and shaking and LEAVING.  I asked him not to touch me and he said ""You are my wife, I will touch you if I want to"".  I was horrified.  But he wouldn't let me leave, he stopped yelling and started begging, and crying.  My son was asleep and I started feeling guilty about waking him up to leave, and the impact that would have on him, but I knew I could NEVER leave him behind.

He yells so much these days, about things I think are seemingly normal daily things, I noticed I now jump if he makes an unexpected sound or movement. That. Is. Fucked. And I know it. 


Thank you for your words.  I got a little choked up. It's all stuff I really need to hear, from people so far removed from the situation they have zero emotional attachment to it.  


I know in a year or so down the road, when the dust is clearing, I will look back on this and wonder why I waited so long.

"Not all guys are into anal. Hell, I'm a bisexual guy who is repulsed by the thought (I'm sure you can imagine the confusion by any guys I've been with....)

So now that that's out of the way, let's get into the real deal:  you want something that you S/O is not cool with. 
This is something you have to talk yourself through....how inportant is it to you?  
Sexual compatibility is a huge deal for many people - so calling this a deal breaker is understandable if you feel it needs to come to it. 

Have you talked to your boyfriend about it?  Is yt something he would be OK with experimenting with and maybe seeing if it's something he could compromise and do sometimes for you?"
"&gt;""Why would we, as new neighbors who want to be on friendly terms with the community make up a story like that?""

This question was already addressed. The neighborhood apparently believes that the husband was creeping on Natalie &amp; failed, so they came up with the story that it was actually Natalie creeping on the husband. That's the narrative, at least. We know it to be the opposite."
"For starters, I think there are a lot of missing details here that could cause a massive shift in the context of the story.

If a blowjob is a pre-requisite to get him fired up and in the mood, then it's not unreasonable for him to turn down sex if she's not in the mood to give one, just like a woman wouldn't be wrong to turn down sex if her partner wasn't willing to do the foreplay she needed to get in the mood.

Or it could just be a power-play, where he doesn't care about satisfying her needs if his particular appetite isn't satisfied.

The way this story is told, there seems to be a major lack of communication. You don't talk about wanting to be intimate, you don't talk about being disappointed, you don't talk about being frustrated with the lack of intimacy, and when he asks you why you're crying you don't take the opportunity to tell him.

He asked you what was wrong and you apologized. Maybe he truly doesn't care and was going to sleep anyways. Or maybe he heard your brush-off and interpreted it as you not wanting to talk about it.

I get the feeling you expect him to read your mind, and if that is the case, maybe you would get better results if you helped him out and just told him what's on your mind."
"I am pro-choice, but I dislike abortion (Does that make sense?).  

But in this case, OP's options are to have this baby and keep it (keeping this man in her life--so, no), have this baby and put it up for adoption (but since she's married, he'll have say in what happens--so, no), or have an abortion (which means she doesn't have to interact with this man ever again after the divorce).

Pretty obvious that, in this case, OP needs to consider abortion, divorce (keeping the papers, to make sure it was finalized), and moving on with her life in a positive manner."
Totally disagree. They should just each buy their own TP.
"Ha! The chick from my story did the same thing. She spilled out a bunch more, for fear of me later finding out and then definitely dumping her. But guess what, there *was* still more she was hiding. The best liars release what they can to misdirect you from the real stuff. 


You will never know for sure but if it is bad he may only be learning that you can be a push over. My advice is still to take a stand and leave. It will be better for both of you. He will have to think twice before doing something like that to someone again, and you can tell a future partner that you left someone at the first sign of a lie."
"You know what comes between an engagement and someone becoming your sister-in-law? A wedding. A wedding where both the bride and the groom might invite their siblings. 

You have to be honest about what you did now so it doesn't distract from the wedding of these lovely people. "
"PLEASE tell me your age is made up,because you're dating a pedophile you know?"
"Unless your desire was for drama I don't understand what telling Pia would accomplish. She's still grieving and with death, especially suicide, there is often a lot of anger that can linger with friends and family. My guess she is going to lash out at Tom for his (admittedly stupid and insensitive) comments. 

You don't get the right to be mad at her. You made the decision to give her this knowledge. This is one of those things that you can't possibly expect someone to deal with rationally. "
"You should be careful how you phrase the question. Do you just say ""are you listening?"" This can come accross as accusatory. Ask him a question that is specifically related to something you said and which required his engaged thought, like an opinion on a solution to a problem. When discussing how his actions are bothering you, be sure to use ""I statements"". This is a good practice in being assertive rather than accusatory. Also note that men and women often communicate differently where women tend to be more communal sharers and it might not be as natural for him to communicate in this way.

Edit: Down votes huh? I guess people really hate tried and true conflict resolution techniques."
"So he got drunk and did the whole stripper thing, in response to *that*? Wow. You expressed discomfort and communicated that you didn't want to hold him back from doing what he wants, and that if it came to a head then it would just have to be a dealbreaker... I mean, his reaction to this just seems really excessive. 

Clearly he's struggling with stuff but... it's up to you if you want to deal with the time and energy that changes are going to require. Ultimately he has to do all the work, but it's going to involve some from you at some point. This depth of issues doesn't go away in a day."
"my mother actually wished my sister happy birthday the day AFTER her actual birthday.. 
Her reasoning? My sister didnt have her added on Facebook. 
She only has me and her as kids, you'd think she'd recall. 

Facebook IS a godsend though, I remember all my family's birthdays, but for some not so close friends, its a great reminder. "
"If you're having physical symptoms from stress every couple of weeks, you're too stressed out. Stress is contagious, and really distracting at work.

You should look into stress relief &amp; relaxation techniques. Sometimes even two really deep breaths is enough to break out of a spiral. 

It can be an addiction - we can become habituated to that fight-or-flight adrenaline response and feed everything into it because it's the only way we know how to solve problems. It's also really bad for your body in the long term. 

I'd take this as an opportunity to help yourself. If you do learn to manage it, I promise you your life will improve in MANY ways."
Okay but she is a terrible person
I don't think there's any risk of that. He was pretty level headed and understood what we were doing pretty well. 
What does your husband say when you talk to him about this?
"I assume that by *religious* homeschooling, they mean homeschooling motivated by and focused entirely around religion. Not ""homeschooling by parents who just happen to be religious""."
"Wow dude, you're a dick. Your poor wife. She tries really fucking hard at something shes not good at, and you dont have a single nice thing to say. Instead you insult her cooking worse than it actually is. You should cook your own damn food lazy prick. "
"I changed my meds in July because I hated how my libido was diminished so I changed it to a different medication with dr. Approval that turned out to work better. My bf made the excuse last weekend that this new medication must be causing problems as well. He was fishing for excuses to blame me. 

I realized that he acts this way when he's frustrated or angry. He is highly aware that he becomes cruel when he is angry or frustrated.  When he isn't mad he is a different person, and doesn't make these expectations or expect me to abide by them.

It's weird...

So...if I am to follow all the comments on this board. And make my own conclusion. 

He is verbally abusive and cruel when he is mad or frustrated and sexually controlling in the same respect.

I really don't like thinking about this. It's put me in a dark place. 

No I no longer truly think I would marry him, but now I want to talk. I want to hear it from him. I want a deep conversation and if I can't have that. Then I will step out."
"You are kind of acting spoiled... just to be honest. 

Just because you make a ""sacrifice"" doesn't mean it has to be paid back. That's like doing someone a favor and expecting them to repay it. 

You said you deferred the choice to him, he made his choice and you went with it. If you wanted to go to your party you should have made that clear and explained it to him. Obviously, he's going to be exhausted Saturday - you could go to your party alone for a few hours and then go to be with him for a quiet rest of the evening. 

You need to find compromise, this isn't going to last forever, you only have a few more months of this schedule it sounds like. "
"It's totally possible she wouldn't have noticed it because period flow is not constant. So like, some could have bled through while she was asleep (and stained the couch) but then when she woke up, there might not have even have had anything actively coming out. The spot on the couch (and her underwear) could have already dried or at least enough that it wasn't noticeable. Maybe she had rolled away from it or was otherwise no longer in contact with it. I think if she hadn't rushed out, she would have probably noticed it (but no guarantee if it were dried, she probably wouldn't notice her underwear until the next time she went to the bathroom)."
"They can inform you on the limits and what you need for action in the future - and they will understand their responsibilities/duty/capability and local laws better than me. Contacting them intitially will at least (as I underatand) start some kind of record, which is what you want, at the least."
"Definitely, Whenever she's particularly excited about something I can usually tell and I'll ask her some open ended questions to give her some room to get her thoughts out on it."

"An entry level set from Costco with a diamond sharpener (about $150 and $50, respectively) will do great for just about any home use, and last for ages."
"I have a client with a whole set of Cutco knives. They're garbage imo. Cheap plastic handles, can't hold an edge, really awkward to hold. I came to hate those knives after working with them day in and day out. It's hard enough for people with developmental disabilities to learn how to chop veggies anyway, but add in crappy equipment and it's an incident report waiting to happen. I can't fathom spending $1200 on that level of quality, no matter how many pieces you're getting. My ultra fancy, super luxurious Messermeister chef's knife cost a tenth of that (albeit on sale) and it could run circles around a whole superset of Cutco blades, no contest."
"It's ok to have just one date.  It doesn't have to lead to anything serious.  In fact, a date and some social interaction can be beneficial."
"She is manipulating you..mental illness or imbalance or whatever aside-she manipulates and guilts you into getting your undivided attention.

"Oddly enough my boyfriend and I are in a similar situation of living closer to my school which is a 15 minute train for me, but a 30 minute to an an hour drive for him or moving near his school which is an hour and 30 minute bus ride for me,  but a 15 minute drive for him, and I never considered the toll the drive takes because I don't drive. This thread really put it in perspective for me that the bus ride is the sweeter deal because I can just reddit or do homework. I never thought about how much it sucks to drive on the 405 in LA for an hour as opposed to chilling on a bus. "
"Please don't place a lot of stock in this sort of calculation; 7 weeks will be an approximate figure, and we don't if the figure she's providing is gestational age (measure from last period) or embryonic (how long since fertilisation) age."
"Yeah, I try to. We are normally out of the house for the weekends, but it's infuriating to come back after being gone all day to find a trashed apartment. We spent the weekend at my parents a couple weekends ago and I think we will spend Thanksgiving week there as well. 

Thanks!"
Did you read her post? She's asked him to clean it up but doesn't. He blames other people for it. It's gotten so bad that she's stepping I'm it.  I think a few choice expletives are reasonable when your man child of a bf is literally peeing on the floor and refusing to clean it up.
"Let's not be sexist, no one is smart at that age. Point and case OP not understanding why he's getting suspicious."
"He might feel that he is replacing him as the new son, but he is ood enough to understand what adoption is and what kind of life he may have lived. He needs to know what he is doing and saying is not okay and will not be tolerated. 

This may seem far fetched but if his attitude for him never changes please be sure to have a will and update it to clearly outline his share (adopted child). We see too much of that here. "
"And if she refuses, OP needs to quietly go see a lawyer to discuss his options. "
"You are doing nothing wrong and ruining nothing by telling your dad the truth. Ashley knew your dad was out of the house. She didn't know that you woke up early.   She thought no one was around, so she showed her true self on that phone call.

Tell him you woke up early. Heard Ashley talking about you on the phone to someone. And that you're sorry you eavesdropped but you got curious when you heard your name.

Tell him that you heard her say that she said she wanted to start an actual family instead of looking like the blind side family when you're gone.

Tell him you felt physically sick after you heard this and that you didn't know what to do and that's why you stayed home from school.

He's your dad...he sounds like a good one at that.  He'll take care of it."
"To be honest op, you sound a bit narcissistic to me. Nothing your older daughter did is malicious - it's something reasonable parents would do to discipline their kids, which you haven't been doing to your younger daughter. It's like you've convinced yourself your older daughter is bad and must have bad intentions when she is behaving very normally and you're just letting the younger off the hook with zero parenting. Very much a golden child/scape goat dynamic. You're gonna fuck up your kids psychologically if you kept his up, if you haven't already..."
"I have a friend whose daughter was raped and friend's ex-husband said she asked for it.  This is what OP's post reminds me of.  Yes, I'd be afraid to have kids with this guy."
I agree; OP's supervisor didn't handle this well.
"&gt; My wife and I used to move with them just so I could see my son as much as I could.

&gt;I have always been to every game.

&gt;I have tried several camping trips, go-karting, an amusement park etc.

You really sound like a wonderful father and I'm so sorry that you're not being treated as such.

I think that your son will one day realize that and regret every ounce of disrespect he has thrown at you (he's still so young...). It's likely to be long while until then, but I do believe the day will come. You're not to blame for any of this and you should know that all you have done to offer him a better life is really admirable whether it ultimately works out for the best or not.

"My ex bought me the ""Back to Black"" album by Amy Winehouse after ""Rehab"" came out and I mentioned I liked the song (side note: he didn't listen to the radio so he didn't realize how popular it was). 

We listened to the full album and both really liked it. Later that day we go to hang out with his friends and the album gets mentioned. They tease him a little bit (because it was popular and he prided himself on liking obscure shit), and all of a sudden he was too cool for it. 🙄

Dude, the truly cool thing would be to own what you like and not be influenced by your peers. That was just a small example of how he was immature. "
"You're not negative, you're realistic. He's being an idiot who very well could wind you both up in a very bad place financially. The saying, ""Don't count your eggs before they hatch"" exists for a reason."
"&gt;not have me put any limitations on what those relationships are or could be. 

That's a problem since poly relationship need to have boundaries.

&gt;She says there's nothing missing in our relationship, simply that she wants to find love and sexual freedom outside of our marriage. 

She wants love outside the marriage.  Are you ready to invite Dan, or someone else, into you house?

Your wife has done a 180 and she doesn't seem interested in your feelings about it.  You need to sit her down and explain that she is jeopardizing her marriage and she is completely ignoring you in her situation. "
"He may have come across like a jerk, but he sounds like he's at his wit's end.  Don't send the letter and you and your friends stay off his land.  Problem solved.  I wouldn't want people hunting on my land either."
What will be the point of that? They won't want to watch them and they won't understand them. 
"You're being completely unreasonable, sorry. You're not married, it's just a dating anniversary. His parents, who barely know you, should not have to plan their family trip around your dating anniversary, nor should they have to invite you."
"Abusive is a strong word to throw out to describe someone. When your mother says that, is she referring him as physically or emotionally? "
"But she thinks it is a good idea based on her life experience. People who didn't have abusive childhoods don't understand just how damaging that is even when you are an adult. Even when they can sympathize with what happened, they don't get the gravity of it. This happens with my wife all the time. People tell her that she needs to stay in touch with her parents because they are family. It's bullshit, they continue to be horrible, and when they aren't being horrible just being around them causes her stress. It isn't worth it. 

I suggest finding a good psychologist or therapist. Someone who can help you tackle your feelings about your childhood and get you to a place where you can decide what is best for you. "
"The marriage, kids, house and responsibility aren't going to come the instant you decide you're ready. They usually come after at least a year or two of being in a relationship, because that's how long it can take to actually find out whether the other person is a suitable match for you. 

Let's say you're now 29 and ready for marriage, you break up with your current girlfriend, and now what? Maybe you find someone right away, two years pass, it doesn't work out. You spend a couple months mourning the relationship, you find someone else, a year passes, it doesn't work out. Let's say it takes 3 relationships before finding your future wife - give or take 5 years total. Now you're 34, two more years before marrying your wife, one more year before you have a kid, and you're 37. See how it took you so much longer to achieve your goals when you delayed making decisions that would push you closer to your goals?

Life goals and life plans require thinking ahead. You say you *know* she isn't going to be what you want in a few years. You say you want marriage and kids and a house and a stable family, it's just that you want it in a couple years, not immediately. Account for that if you actually want it. "
"I don't understand what happened here. You were dating, and she had a porn blog. What is a porn blog? A blog about porn? A blog of porn?

Was this blog public? So everyone in the world could look at it, but not you? Could people tell the blog was by her? Did anyone who know her, other than you, know about it?

You were dating, but because of this, she broke up with you and is now not talking to you. I have no idea how long it will take her to get over this, because I don't fully understand what happened ..."

"You can't simultaneously state you're against marriage but consent to ""holding out"" as husband and wife, an element in Texas common law marriage. 


Common law marriage was based on the reality that judges literally rode around in circuits and were only in town a very short period of the year. It was logistically very difficult to get married back then, so it was enough to cohabitate and ""hold out"" as being married. 


Nowadays, anyone serious about marriage can just head downtown and pay a small fee. 


It was meant for old time folks who never had a judge in town, not anti-marriage men and the women holding onto hope. "

"Many apprentice tattoo artists will practice on themselves. 
But aside from that, going to an artist without tattoos would be incredibly bizarre (eta: *for me*). When you meet a person who is rendering you a service, especially one that will stay with you for the rest of your life, you want him or her to look experienced and well versed in the art or business. Part of that for a tattoo artist is having tattoos. You wouldn't want to go to a hair stylist who had unkempt, damaged, badly colored hair even though they don't typically do their own hair either, and a tattoo is a bigger decision than a hair cut."
"Block her number, any numbers she uses to call you after hers is blocked, block her on all social media, return all mail she sends unopened.

The sad fact is that you can't stop her from trying to contact you, you can just not respond to her contact. 

Honestly though, I'd start documenting everything she does regarding contacting you - she called you abusive for not wanting to talk to her after she cheated, that sets alarm bells ringing. She sounds like the sort of person who'll cry abuse if it suits her, and you don't want the hassle of false accusations to deal with as well. If everything is documented and evidenced, you're protected."

"She says that she knows I'm out with my friends and she doesn't want to bother me. The thing is I text her multiple times with no response and I've told her it doesn't bother me one bit.

It's your wife's house too and not only does she do all the laundry and cleaning and child rearing, she's also going back to work! Are you kidding me?

"&gt;But you illustrate a great point in that the opposite of I am happy being alone can say that I think women are nuts.

I did not say this at all. I said You claim to be happy being single, and live a more productive life that way.  When coupled with ""Women are nuts and all relationships bring trouble"" that directly negates you saying you are happy being single because you don't *need* someone to complete you.  It shows that you are jaded by your past, and as much as you claim to not be you are in denial.  But until you are ready to listen and not actually just hear this, there is no further point in repeating myself.  It won't change until you are ready.

I suspect you haven't already done this because she might suddenly have a strong opinion about something that inconveniences you.

"I have a SIL who is a lot like this. She had a child at 18 moved another guy into her parents house while pregnant, kicked him out when the child was 2 moved  baby daddy into her parents house( the same day from across the country). Baby daddy broke parole to come down here.

 Then she decided she had to have a puppy despite having 3 other dogs in the house and no money. Got puppy realized omg puppy's are work and expensive so gave puppy to shelter. Then announced on FB that she scheduled to get her Bc removed and will be trying for another child immediately while working a min wage job, living with her parents and BF  ( she has never lived on her own), zero savings, no room or time for any child, and being on govt assistance. 


I straight up told her this was a horrible idea since no one else would and I guess she cried to mommy and daddy who reemed me out a new one I mean how dare I imply their precious little buttercup isn't ready for another child!? This led to a falling out since they tried to bash me to make her look better and we've all but gone nc. 

My point is I can relate and there are no good options here. She is going to continue to do whatever the hell she wants and by bringing it up you will become enemy number one. It doesn't matter if your points are perfectly valid it's about what she wants. 

So your best bet is to keep your head down and make clear you will not be responsible for her life decisions now or in the future. You will not be babysitting, providing money, etc. you will be focusing on your own life and making it what you want to be. And one day after you've finished college, are married ( if you so choose), are financially stable, and   are sitting on the patio of a home you own with your well cared for dog running around your feet while your amazingly cared for children ( if you so choose) play soccer in the backyard you will realize it's ok and you at least know you made the right decisions in life. I know because it's pretty much what I'm doing right now while my SIL is still living at home, mooching off her parents and the system in a relationship with a man that hates her. Thank you very much I'd rather be me even if it meant not getting what you want when you want it. "

So sorry this happened.  Get a good attorney.  Seek sole custody and child support--everything you can get for yo and the kids.  Let your wife/ex help pay for their college.  She will soon learn that living like this costs more financially (maybe not emotional in her case) than staying married.  BUT DON’T TAKE HER BACK.  Mention this co-worker to your lawyer.  Her info may be useful, re: the lies, deceit, etc.

I knew someone who got divorced and his mother supported the ex-DIL.  It can happen, but usually to parents who realize that, no matter how they raised their child (like your FIL/MIL and their daughter), that child turns out to be a POS and there’s nothing they can do but be there for the relatively-innocent spouse and the grandchildren.

I know people are saying to leave, that you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves. But if you love her and you think you have the emotional stamina, please stay with her.

"Your boyfriend does not want to go to your family Halloween party. He is using his best friend as an excuse to not go, and he's hoping that you buy it. He and his best friend don't even have plans, your boyfriend just doesn't want to go to your family Halloween party. It's just easier for him to have a convenient excuse than to tell you he doesn't want to spend time with your family. 

It sounds like your boyfriend is not very assertive. It sounds like he has a hard time being truthful about what he really wants. If he wanted to spend more time with you, he would stand up to his best friend and say ""sorry, I have plans with my girlfriend. Maybe another time."" But he doesn't do that. Instead, what it sounds like to me, is that he would rather spend time with his best friend, but instead of telling you that, he just sort of pins it on his best friend, like ""oh my best friend is so pushy what can I do?"" Instead of being straight up an honest with you, that he prioritizes his friend over you and he's just afraid to tell you that."
"As long as your savings for your brother aren't at a detriment to your own personal savings, I don't see an issue.

Regarding the boyfriend, some of his reaction may stem from him not knowing how to handle that after your parents pass the responsibility for your brother falls on you. Which, by association, if you were to stay together would include your boyfriend. "

So you spazzed out a little. Sounds to me like you needed to release a lot of previously pent up frustrations. Was it dramatic? Sure. But so what? Seemed proportional to me. As for the little revenge fantasies, we all have them. The dividing line between ""crazy"" and not crazy is whether or not you've acted on them. 

Stop beating yourself up. You're allowed to have emotions and you're allowed to vent those emotions in silly dramatic ways sometimes.

There is nothing in that statement that needs to be elaborated. He was being crystal clear and he was telling you exactly who he is and what your relationship is going to look like if you stay with him.

Since he's been this way from the start, you really shouldn't hang around expecting him to change. You either take what he's offering (which is shit, imo) or walk away. Personally, I think that you're young and you've only been with this guy for a year so you might as well cut your losses now rather than waiting until it's much harder to do.

What can you do? You can sit her down, explain in every detail, how she has been manipulated, and give her advice, how to get her life back on track (cutting her parents out for example, giving up on her child temporarily, contact to her husband only over a lawyer, counselling). You can stop being restrained, when it comes to her husband (And if that makes it awkward for your friend, then let it be awkward for her). You can tell her the difference you noticed in her behaviour, when she was away from him. You can offer her to take her in, while she tries to sort her life out (of course, she has to fulfill conditions). Will it help? Probably not. And then you can cut her out for your own health."

"Thank you for your incredibly thorough response. I really appreciate this. I think I want to send them a letter, and as another commenter suggested, visit them more often (as much as I can).  This has been devastating and a huge punch to the face. Thank you so much for this. 

I live in Canada, and my Mom has full custody of myself and my siblings. My basic needs are met. My Dad pays his child support - nothing more. This was settled fifteen years ago when they divorced and hasn't been adjusted to accommodate his income inflation. It's very expensive to go to court and my Mother cannot afford it. 

My Mom uses child support for food and bills. She works 80 hours a week but doesn't make enough money to put us (there's five of us) above the poverty line. So it's a tough situation.  "

"I feel he needs to take more responsibility in this situation. He should not blame it on being drunk or stoned - in my opinion those factors simply reduce the inhibitions you might normally have while sober, so that he did this or was about to suggests to me it was in the back of his mind all along and he had only a tenuous grasp on his self-control. 

He also should own that a) he has a totally inappropriate relationship with a subordinate, something that should and could cost him his job, and b) that he had the power to keep her at bay and shut her down and he utterly failed to do so. 

At this point, I think you've done the right things to kick him out and require counseling. But he should leave his job (he may be forced to anyway if this ends up getting to his boss) and he owes you that to demonstrate he will NOT be around this person any longer. You should also go together to counseling to talk through why he didn't do more to prevent this and so you can see and hear that he takes full responsibility DESPITE the substances involved. 

If I were you, I'd reserve right to judgment after you see these things fulfilled and how counseling goes. 

EDIT: I also think you should think long and hard about whether you even want to stay in this marriage regardless of any 'fixing' he tries to do. It is a pretty extreme betrayal that he allowed and encouraged her to cross boundaries knowing your concern about it, especially the sharing of personal information. It isn't that he was taken by surprise and almost cheated, it is that he knowingly cultivated a semi-romantic, inappropriate relationship with another woman."
"Ouch. Sucks but your family clearly isn't interested in you bought part of it. I'd say cut them out and make your own family. Grieve the loss of your biological family and move on.

"She might very well feel betrayed by you.  Nevertheless, if you do _not_ do this thing, it is increasingly likely that she might be dead.

If it helps any, I never felt remotely betrayed by the friend who called the cops on me when I was suicidal. I felt a lot of things--useless, ashamed, mortally exhausted--but not angry at them.  Suicidal people react to this stuff differently.

I know you're probably reading these replies, thinking ""Everyone wants me to dump him, but the thing is, he can be so sweet. He's REALLY nice when he's not being mean. People don't understand how much he loves me and I love him."" You're thinking how much it would hurt to be without him, and how guilty you'd feel breaking up.  
 
And we DO know. We know that abusive people are charming, sweet, loving, and kind. We know that your boyfriend might be the best listener you've ever met. Maybe he makes you feel like he's the only person who could ever understand you in this crazy world. We know that when he holds you in his arms, you feel so perfect and right. We know, because many of us have been there, and we used those same reasons to stay with people who treated US horribly. People just like your boyfriend, who would shove us, or hold us down and choke us, or slap us, or punch us. And we'd manage to get away, and cry until we didn't have any tears left, and we'd think ""How could this happen? He's normally NEVER like this. Normally he's so sweet and loving. And I don't know if I could ever leave him, I love him so much...""  
 
So some of us are saying ""leave him"" because we DO know. We know how much you love him, and how you are trying desperately to separate the sweet, charming boyfriend you love from the inhumane asshole who shoves you, elbows you, and smacks things out of your hands instead of talking to you like a normal human being. You don't want them to be the same person. You want to think you can change your boyfriend. Like if you can just say the right words, or explain things the right way, he'll understand and stop.

"You can get 'cute' underwear at Walmart, even cute and comfortable  (cotton) underwear.

"Aww man thats so gross. 
But i get what you mean and i think it really raises the point of ""who are you to comment on her dental care when your own is so lax?""

"I have been in a similar situation with an ex.  He was super excited to meet this friend, insisted hard that she meet up with him when she was in town for a short time, and inconvenienced the group we were with to drive elsewhere and meet up with her.  He was a pretty flirty guy in general and I was fine with that at the time but something about this situation felt weird.  Probably it was his eagerness combined with the fact that he was insisting she was only his friend.

Long story short, I confronted him about how I thought it was odd behavior, he invalidated my feelings, told me I was dramatic, always jealous etc. etc.  We met up with her and he was very flirty, touchy, did not care at all about my feelings.  I left and let them 'catch up.'  I just felt so uncomfortable.

Never got an apology when he came home.  And my gut was right.  She was a very serious ex.  Not long after this event, we split.  That wasn't the first or last time he invalidated my feelings, tried to make me feel like I was overreacting, and did whatever he wanted while I waited around upset.

The guy I'm dating now has never put me in that kind of situation.  I'm invited to meet all of his friends.  He doesn't invalidate my feelings.  That's how it should be.  When someone is your partner you shouldn't come 2nd place to random women.

You don't even need to trust your gut here, this guy is a dick, just like my ex was.  "

"OP...you were *16* when you met this grown ass man. You need to leave him. He only chose you because you were young and easily impressionable. You need to get out now.

"What makes her so ""amazing?"" She didn't want to be with you and communicated that through her actions. She wasn't a good partner for you to pursue, and you did so anyways, rather than listening to what she was telling you.

I'd want space, too, if I clearly expressed my needs and wants (like, that I didn't want to be with someone anymore) and they assumed that they somehow either:
1) knew my needs better than I did, and continued pursuing a relationship
or
2) disregarded my needs because they think *their* needs are more important.

Sorry to be so harsh. I'm only do so because I'd want someone to be and because, frankly, think you need to be harsh on yourself, too: why are you willing to pursue someone who feels, at best, a lackluster desire to date you? Are you afraid of not being in a relationship? Is that truly better than trying to read someone's mind/strange signals all the time? Is that truly better than trying to convince someone to be with you?

You don't have to remain friends if that feels unhealthy or uncomfortable or if you simply just don't want to. Time to start telling people your needs and listening to theirs and stop putting up with someone giving you 10% of those needs. 

And, from one serial monogamist to another: you've got to spend some time alone, developing your sense of individuality outside of a relationship. It'll make you less likely to put up with this kind of bullshit just to avoid being alone, and it'll make someone dumping you less of a mindfuck/invitation to feel and act desperately in order to keep them. You don't need to keep anyone who doesn't want to be kept and a relationship that frankly, wasn't worth keeping anyways. "

Most of forgiveness is about stepping beyond what was done to you.  It's up to you to decide if what she did deserves forgiveness.  It's not about making the perpetrator feel better about themselves, or absolving them post mortem.

He's a 30-year-old man and behaving like this? You're wasting your time with this ""man"" (note I'm using the term loosely here). At his age he should know better and the fact that he clearly does not speaks volumes about his maturity and suitability as a longterm partner. "

"Firstly I want to say congratulations for pushing yourself to get on top of your mental health issues - it sounds like you've come a long way in the past few years and you put in a lot of hard work.


Obviously your mental health will affect your boyfriend. It isn't your fault, it's just the way things are. It might be time to have a serious conversation with him about your mental health. Talk to him plainly about your phobias around birth control and let him know that his pressure is making things more difficult for you. Maybe offering to take him to a therapy appointment could help too, so you can both discuss how best to be a couple in the face of your mental illnesses. 


&gt;I just cannot get him to understand my mental health issues.

"The longer you stay in this relationship, the worse it will get. You'll likely eventually cave to marriage pressure because you ""love her"" but you aren't 100% for marrying her. Then you'll eventually divorce over the reasons you stated that you don't want to marry her. And now you've wasted years of your life in an ""ok"" relationship when you could have a great one. 

Break up if you don't see a future together. It IS unfair to both of you to continue this. "
This is the creepiest message I have read on this subreddit.
"&gt; it's that she is firmly convinced that there is One True Path to Happiness/Success, and there are other, inferior paths that may seem okay, but are actually flawed for reasons 1-5,000.

This is my mom's fault, too. I don't think she is as pushy as yours, but she is confused by the fact I have been dating a guy for almost 4 years and we aren't engaged (I only dated your dad for 6 months!), or how my sister doesn't want kids (becoming a mom was the best thing that ever happened to me), or how my cousin and her husband lived together for a long time before getting married (she was convinced she was just the type to not get married because of that). My mom was raised Catholic if you weren't all wondering.

anyways, like my mom, your mom seems to care about you and your happiness. it's just...misguided.

I agree with others here -- write it out to her. Explain to her everything you've explained to us. Tell her that you want to have a relationship with her, but it's exhausting to feel like your life choices are being critiqued, it makes you unhappy, which is why you don't want to talk to her. If she can be happy with who you are  you would be interested in having a relationship with her."
"Im sorry but whose wedding is this?

Hers? Nuh uh, yours."
"Have her over for dinner and a private girls night and tell her, just the two of you. It'll be easier without feeling like she's on display in public.

Edit: Also remember that this doesn't have to be a huge, dramatic announcement. Yes, she may get upset... but she also may not compare it to herself at all. As someone going through something similar who just had a niece born a month ago, I'm thrilled for my brother. His life is everything that I want, but I don't have any negative feelings toward him or his family. I'm not sad at all with my beautiful little niece. I see his life as something to live up to, but don't feel any jealousy. I look at him and I say, ""That's what I'm aiming for."" And I'll get it. "
"This is so, so important. Words don't just have meaning, they have connotation and how we put them together makes for even more fine shades of meaning. What you mean doesn't matter - concerning both actions and words. The consequences matter. In this case, the consequence is that people are interpreting OP as condescending/corrective.

u/collegegrad24, you can't change how people interpret your words. All you can do is change how you say things until you convey the message you mean to convey. That's on you. 

Your boyfriend will probably be much more forgiving and willing to work with you if you stop saying, ""I get that but...I'm not...I'm just..."" and start working to change your phrasing. Tell him something like, ""I know that my communication style has been unpleasant and I want to work with you to change it. Will you help me do that?""

"Exactly. It's not just the family context. Harassers thrive in environments where everyone thinks it'd be ""too uncomfortable"" to call them out on it. He keeps doing it because he thinks nobody will stop him. Burst that little bubble loudly and obviously, and I guarantee he will stop.

Think of it this way. You can keep unjustly feeling shitty for the rest of your life, or you can make everybody feel uncomfortable **once,** and be done with it. He definitely deserves it, and they arguably deserve it too for enabling him all these years. 

I know all too well that inertia can be powerful, and that doing nothing can sometimes seem infinitely preferable to standing up. You are in the right here, though, and you'll be glad you did it. "

"I tell her to kill herself

So you're an abuser. Depression is not an excuse. It's weird that you reference the fight in third person, like the person who said those things isn't you. You have to take responsibility for your actions. 

You're blaming this on everyone but yourself, and using cute euphemisms like ""assholery"" to cover up the damage you did. ""And such."" So cute! How adorable, you're abusive! It's not like you're a real grown up or anything. You're just a kid, trying to figure things out, you know? You didn't mean it! I mean, she kind of brought it on herself, you know?

It's not cute. You're an abuser. The first step to not being an abuser is admitting that you are one and starting therapy, with the sincere motive to change. And not just trying to cute-ify and trivialize your actions to win over your therapist and get even more validation. 

Let me guess: now you're thinking, ""why is everyone here being so mean to me? I didn't even do anything that bad! These people are unreasonable and their opinions are wrong. I'm only going to listen to the ones that are nice to me.""

She pushed me into meeting my fundamentalist biological grandparents, who I'm not the biggest fan of. She has had my birth dad and his wife stay at the house I grew up in multiple times, and went along to thanksgiving last year. This christmas we are going to Texas (from Canada) to stay with my birth dad's wife's family. The only thing I've asked is for her and my adoptive dad to please let me go to thanksgiving alone, and for them to sit this particular holiday out. I don't get any alone time with my birth dad and his wife, as my adoptive parents are always around. As well, when we first got into touch, my mom and dad (adoptive) had the password to my personal email account. They read the extremely private emails to my birth dad and to his  wife. I came out in those emails, and my adoptive parents (who are very conservative christians) punished me for it.

"&gt; I'm not over the moon at the idea, but does that come in time?

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Is that a gamble you want to take?

&gt;So that makes me think I'll reach that point too?

You are not them. You are you. Stop trying to compare your life to others. Stop trying to live your life by other peoples' metrics. Look within yourself and ask two very important questions.

**Why would I want to have children**

Then write down every reason you think of.

then ask

**why would I NOT want to have children**

And write down all of those reasons. 

Then compare the lists.

Also, you really really REALLY need to examine each reason, pro and con, and research them. Don't buy the kodak moments of what life could be like and close your eyes and go for it. For something as serious as bringing another being into existence, you need to test and question each and every assumption you have.

If, after this whole process, the risks are worth it to you **for yourself** then do it. If the risks are NOT worth it **for you** then don't do it. Both choices are valid. Both require being true to yourself and no small measure of bravery. 

&gt;I respect that not everyone wants to have kids, and that's a totally valid decision that I would never judge anyone for making. I just am not sure I'm in that camp.

"Reasons why this isn't worth salvaging (btw, I am so so sorry. You called him your best friend, and I can't even imagine the pain you must be feeling. But the fact that you love him so much is why I'm writing this)

1. Your best friend cheated on you.
2. Your best friend lied to your face about it
3. Your best friend did this with a girl he KNEW you were uncomfortable with
4. OTHER PEOPLE had to get up in your relationship for him to ""reign it back"". He didn't listen to you, the woman he claimed to love so much, he waited until it became too ridiculous to ignore
6. Idk when he cheated on you with her, but whenever it was, he still managed to keep up some semblance of a friendship with her (how fucking SHAMELESS) while still with you
7. He was and is willing to take this betrayal to his grave and lie to you about being a faithful partner


Bonus:

8. He WILL break down with regret if and when you confront him. But girl, trust me when I say that if he get true remorse, he wouldn't have even been able to look you in the EYE after it happened. Trust me. I know. It would've killed him to interact with you....but no. Not only that, but this fucker cheats on you and lies to you and STILL thinks he's good enough to share his life with you?

Uh, no. You deserve a relationship with someone who acknowledges your worries, who tries their best not to make you uncomfortable (and doesn't brush it off), someone who puts you first! That wilting feeling that you now have? It won't go away. Not for years. Is it really worth it to salvage a relationship with a guy who not only stabs you in the back, but twists the knife by lying about it? :'( Girl, he's been caught red-handed, you get that stab wound looked at by someone REAL instead of running to the guy who stabbed you, bandages in hand, asking him to help fix what HE RUINED.

You sound like a bamf. And you deserve much better."
"If that's the case, I'm strongly suggesting you bring a friend along in case things turn for the worst.

Your classmates' grades are not your responsibility, and they're not entitled to the results of your hard work.  Nor are they entitled to your protection: if they keep harassing you over this, I'd ask the teacher if you can take your exams in private from now on, and be honest about why."

"Wow what a read. I will try to keep my personal feelings out of this.

I think your husband is hurt and he has clearly taken a major hit to his self esteem. I think he is also scared because you clearly have many people that you could move on to at any moment. I think you need take a step back and think clearly about what matters most to you. If you care about your husband and this marriage, I would say this open relationship thing isn't working and it needs to stop.

Yes your husband wanted it to happen because he wanted to sleep with another woman but I also think he has learned his lesson (and props to him at least for asking for an open relationship instead of cheating behind your back).

If you end up deciding that you don't care for your husband anymore then I would suggest still putting a hold on this open relationship, ending things with him first and then continuing doing whatever you want. It would be the respectable way to approach things.

I wish you the best of luck, this is a tough situation and it won't necessarily be easy"
"I wouldn't. Living together is a huge change, and it can be hard on a relationship. And you're going to feel stuck and unable to move out if you're there to help him manage his condition. I'd let him get it under control first and then move in."
"I honestly don't think you're safe with this guy. Perhaps he was your friend once, but this kind of behaviour is very disturbing and not very friend-like.

"I think I'm not expressing myself well, so I'm sorry about that. I agree that threatening to leave is unhealthy and manipulative, and I'm not saying OP should dangle that over his head. I'm more latching into the fact that OP's boyfriend won't discuss this with her. He's made a unilateral decision, but when she tries to express why that upsets her, he won't have an adult conversation about it. What are you supposed to do when someone won't work with you to solve problems, or when someone refuses to take your thoughts and feelings into consideration? 

I realize ""talk about moving out"" doesn't come across the same way through text as it did in my head. I was going for a sassy way of saying that a partner who refuses to communicate is a dealbreaker for me. If a partner makes decisions for me without my input, especially if it involves canceling plans we had made together, they need to explain to me why they did it, allow me to explain why it upset me, and handle it in an adult way. 

Threatening to leave gets you nowhere, so I apologize for being unclear. But I can't help ask what I would do in OP's shoes if her boyfriend continues to reuse to talk to her. 

Also, calling me ""hun"" came across as kind of condescending to me, which I think is unnecessary. If that's not how you meant it, then my bad, no offense taken, but no need to be rude, you know? "
"One last message. ""Molly, I don't want this friendship to continue.

This isn't an easy decision for me, you're family and I love you but I can't be there for you at the cost of my own mental wellbeing. I hope you understand that I have struggled with this for a long time and I get no pleasure from upsetting you like this.""

And then maybe if you're feeling optimistic, add a line saying you're open to see her again if she gets therapy and takes some time for herself. Because no matter what happens OP, you're going to have to draw the line somewhere. "

"I'm not the person you originally asked, but I have an answer:

Porn, honestly. Porn made me want to try it. I was thinking about it one time while I was masturbating, had a crayola marker in reach, and was curious.

But, it also took me years of playing with different things during my masturbation routine before I got up to full-on wanting a cock up my butt. And I did a lot of research to find the best kind of lube. I also have to be in the right mood for it. 

Also note, ""butt plug anal"" is entirely different from actually being fucked. I'm still not comfortable with actually being fucked. If you don't mind me getting a little graphic for a minute, anal for me is sitting on my boyfriend's dick while I masturbate. Then we change the condom and finish up vaginally.

The point is, if you find one day you want to explore it, there are a lot of options between never and full on getting pounded. It's all about slow, patient exploration. If you really, really just never want to do it, that's fine too.

EDIT: I guess it also helps that my boyfriend is totally okay with letting me dictate what I want and go at my own pace."

"This situation is way more simple than this post makes it seem to be. 

You sound like you've had a bit of a crush on him before the hookup. He was single/vulnerable, you swooped in. He realized it was a mistake and ended things. Your (not so great) friend who has probably known about your crush started egging you on about how ""unfair"" this is for you. You feel justified/validated to escalate the situation (like taking it personal that he is dating or asking people to help with the cat) making things 100 times more awkward. 

No one really did anything wrong here except follow their hearts/dick/vagina into a situation that had a low rate of success. All this ""using"" and ""manipulation"" talk will not get either of you anywhere. 

Someone could say that he manipulated you because he fooled around with you when he wasn't sure about you. 

Someone could also say you used his post-breakup state to get him to fool around with you. 

The truth is you are both adults who are capable of making choices. You both made a dumb choice, but it happens. You need to move out. Because you are obsessing over him more than the other way around I think you should move for the sole purpose of putting this behind you. Trying to negotiate with him will only make you have to interact with him more, prolonging you getting over him.

Ugh ew ugh ewwww &lt;-- me reading about this guy. Trust your gut. If your mum thinks creepo is so great she can date him. 
"I get it. I'm so ticklish that if someone does that to me I pretty much have the same reaction. 

I don't think there's any coming back from this. You don't need her friends hassling you, I don't know why she's behaving like this though. Attention? Bored of the relationship and looking for a way out? Let her get on with it. If she reports you to the Police for domestic violence who do you think they will belive? Partners who are violent against their partners do not drive them to the hospital to check they are OK. They don't generally give black eyes, preferring to create marks where they can't be seen. Did you tell the hospital what had happened as this will be noted down somewhere hopefully. The hospital staff would be trained to pick up on if this is really something else going on. For example; her being scared during the hospital visit, cowering away from you etc. If she has backed up the story of what happened then she can spin all the stories she likes. The fact is you have owned up to it by apologising and saying what happens in text. Her response is ""so?"" A person who genuinely felt a wrong doing would not respond with ""so"" they would be saying ""no, you did that on purpose!"" Etc.

Facebook post? Up to you but I find silence is golden. Those who are your true friends will stand by you anyway. If you need to answer these people then tell them what happened and let them make their own minds up. I'm not a huge fan of big Facebook posts but I can see why it would benefit you. I do feel like it may make things worse for you though and make a bigger issue of it than it needs to be. Her friends: What do they expect you to say? Yeah I hit her on purpose? Walk away from this drama with your head high as I'm sure this is an indication of how she will behave in the future. 

Edit: More words."

"This is a good job for a student who could use this extra time to study or complete homework and papers. 

I think it seems like they just want you to sit and look pretty, however if you need some kind of mental stimulation to keep sane, I would use this time to learn something (if you don't want to quit) learn all the names of your bones, read some poetry, catch up on a good novel. 

I have a similar job, except I need to stay at my desk incase I get a calls, so it makes for some lonely closings. I also can't quit because I want to start nursing school, and this job gives me so much study time.

"The thing is that he really didn't seem to have such a lack of ambition until after graduation.  He was a 3.5-4.0 GPA student and helped me start a politically active student group. He took a full courseload every semester and worked about 20 hours a week and would stay busy in class/working/studying until 9-10p.m. on an average night.
It's been since graduation that he acted like this, which as you can imagine, really frustrates me."
THIS. making the situation awkward for her may help you through this problem.
"Well, it varies a ton from person to person, but here's one way to think about it. 

The first thing to do is to recognize you don't actually have to _do_ anything because you feel or think a certain way - that feelings do not compel actions. This idea can run into a lot of resistance, because people who have gone through emotional abuse often have difficulty setting up boundaries - they think they _have_ to do things, or _can't_ do things. So this in and of itself is a process.

The second thing to do is meet your physical needs. People who have been in abusive relationships often do not see themselves as worth being cared for. The ultimate goal of all of this is to care for yourself more and soothe yourself more,  but at this point, it's about getting out of the red zone - Get some sleep. Stop drinking. Remove yourself from anything that's really distressing to the point of physical pain, like rest an injury or cut yourself off from Facebook or reddit or really violent video games for a bit. Eat food you like. Have sex if you want. Take a shower. Wash your clothes. Get a haircut. 

Massive unmet physical needs can be like somebody banging a spoon on a pan by your head. They make it very hard to think clearly, and no matter how tough you think you are, they affect you.

So, once you've done that, here's an idea to consider - your whole emotional life has a volume knob - it can all get loud, or it can all get quiet - and it can do this in ways that don't line up with what things ""mean.""

For example, violence, sex and horror are all connected. Some people, whenever they feel one, they feel a specific aspect of another. This is because behind it all is this volume knob, and all these things can be loud. ""Arousal"" is a generalizable state.

This means, for example, if you always go for risky, dangerous sex but it isn't what you really want, you might need to pay more attention to your emotional volume levels.

Or, if you find yourself always having  really distressing conversations about trauma when you don't want to, it might be because something else has turned up your emotional volume. 

So, once you get this idea of emotional volume, consider: PTSD can make you an emotional metalhead. 

If the volume goes up a little bit, it can make you want to _crank it the fuck up_. There are various theories why, but mostly it's just a thing that happens.

Except imagine you're a metalhead who doesn't like metal, or who at least wants to listen to less of it. This puts you in a tough spot, because you hear a little bit you rationalize and find reasons to crank it the fuck up.

This is how a lot of people recapitulate traumatic feelings. This is what triggers are actually about. You want to turn that metal up so damn bad that you come up with all sorts of crazy things to do, like talk a mile a minute or stay up all night or harm yourself. And it's very hard to control because it doesn't make sense - because it isn't about the specific meaning of what you're doing, it's about that volume knob.

A really important thing to learn how to do as somebody with PTSD is to think about your arousal level in general terms, whether what's changing it is good or bad. 

And then don't try to fix the problem, whatever it is,  try to adjust the volume.

And usually you have to do this through second-order thinking - like,  don't just ""go to sleep,"" make sure you give yourself time and the conditions to calm down (my therapist calls it ""down-regulating"") before bedtime. If something routinely upsets you, consider limiting your exposure to it, even if you like it. 

Shocks to watch out for that can pump up the volume:

- Physical deprivation (getting too hungry or not sleeping enough)
- Hormone imbalances (exercise or nutrition can help with this)
- Extreme workouts
- Overworking yourself
- Extremely stimulating video games
- Any addiction
- Sex
- Moral conflict
- Self-directed cruelty or loathing
- Loneliness
- Not having any personal space
- Traveling

You can still do all these things, but they might affect you more if you have PTSD in ways you don't like, so you might want to manage them rather than getting all turnt up and recapitulating your trauma.

And also remember you don't _have_ to do any of this. That in itself can set you off- feeling like doing it right is an obligation. 

Some people might think this is improper, to manage arousal downward in a general way rather than ""live life to its fullest,"" but remember, you've already been through Hell. You earned your stripes. You've got nothing to prove.

**TL;DR - If you have PTSD, you can potentially reduce how much you do specific things you feel like you can't control by lowering and managing your general level of stimulation and arousal.**"
"Then he should probably continue his quest to find a virgin girlfriend. Otherwise he's just being dramatic and trying to punish her for a past personal choice that hurt zero people. 


I think it's genuinely disturbing as fuck for a person to strangler kittens. If my fiancee had done so in the past, I'd be disturbed enough to break up with her, not just casually disparage it in passing. 




edit: Here's a more real world example. My fiancee had white girl dreads for a couple years in college. I don't find that hairstyle attractive and I probably wouldn't have dated her had I been present at that time. But she liked that hairstyle when she had it, and no one was remotely hurt by that choice. So I don't go around telling people that her former hairstyle disturbs me, because the innocent things she did with her hair when she was 20 are not remotely any of my damn concern. "

Another talk needs to happen with your  daughter and Tom about safe sex. Yes condoms break but they are inexperienced. What about another form of birth control for her? 

Your husband could also be upset that his daughter is sexually acting but at least she is with someone she trusts and likes. I'm not sure what to do with him other than a talk. He won't listen maybe family counseling would help."

Shit, there's so many ways to meet people if you don't know people, you just have to do a little leg work. Look for hiking groups on Kijiji or craigs list. Look for open houses at craft breweries. Check Meetup. Look for paint and sips.  Look for requests for volunteers at soup kitchens or animal shelters or hospital fundraisers.

Look for stuff like ""Ophelia Speaks: Adolescent Girls Write About Their Search for Self"" by Sara Shandler which is short essays about experiences like your daughter's.  It is terrifying for a mom.  Try buying something like that and giving it to her as a source of support and ideas.

"&gt; The combination of her clothing, makeup, and hair choices would make most patients and colleagues not take her seriously.

"I eat meat. I eat almost anything. I love going out and getting two meals with my partner and sharing both of them, trying new things, etc. 

I dated a guy for a short time who ate meat, but was picky. Ate the traditional ""American"" foods...chicken, burgers, pasta, and eating was more something he had to do, rather than something he enjoyed. 


My fiance is a vegetarian. We go out for Italian, Turkish, Thai, Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian, Vegetarian, American, Italian, etc, etc. Unless I really want something with meat, we usually get two meals and share them. Always willing to try new places, as long as they have vegetarian options. If I really want to try a place, he's fine with it, as long as he can find one thing on the menu that's ok, even if it's not ideal.


It's not that she's a vegetarian, it's that she seems to only like Italian. What does she say when you suggest trying other places? Suggest that you search Happycow.com together and look for local places. 

Is it that she's sick of not being able to find veg food and has resigned herself to Italian? Do you live somewhere with lots of options, or in a small town that is very meat-heavy? Or is she genuinely just really picky and not want anything else?"

"It's not that you don't think her to be the most attractive woman EVER, it's that youre stupid enough to say that to someone. I mean, come on dude, you're 24, how the fuck did you think that was a good idea?

There is so much stupidity going on here quite frankly. First off, if she has jealousy issues in the first handful of months of dating, you can bet your ass those are gonna get waaaaaay worse. Like she's already going through your phone without permission? That's fucked up and it's just a *taste* of what's to come

But secondly, you obviously don't respect her enough to not say shit like ""you find her friend more attractive"" to other people. What a fucking awful thing to do to someone you supposedly care for.

Seriously, there are a number of people in my life I greatly dislike, but I would never stoop to treating them the way you are being treated.

Don't believe their lies. Abusers will always blame their victim for their own poor behaviour. ""Look what you made me do"", they say, as if what they do is ever justified."

"If he's referring to you as ""that fucker"" in his texts, those texts are no longer passive aggressive, just aggressive. He's having himself a proper tantrum. 

I didn't see the word ""custody"" anywhere in your post. What is their legal situation? If the kid lives primarily with his mother, you will in his day to day life be for all intents and purposes his dad. He's not even a year old, so you are the only consistent male presence in his life. Sucks for the one-night-stand father, but them's the breaks. This is the territory that comes with breakups and dating single parents. 

Personally I don't think you should do anything. The biological father is going to be pissed that he's missing out on his child's day to day life either way. Until he learns how to soothe his own feelings, you're not going to smooth things over. 

&gt;I'm in no way shape or form trying to take his place as a dad. 

Could I ask why? I could understand this sentiment if the kid were like 10 or 12 or a teenager or something and had an existing relationship with his father. But the kid is a baby. He WILL see you as his dad as he grows up, and probably not the man who comes by once in a while (but again, depends on the custody situation). "
"That's disgusting. That he devolved into a rapist. I'm sorry you lost your friend. ):

My BIL is still 40-50% the old him... like as far as I know he hasn't surrounded himself with a bunch of RedPiller friends (lol what a circlejerk that would be). But yeah I'm not going to bother reasoning with him. I know it falls on deaf ears. A few weeks ago my husband and him got into a slight tiff about how he was talking, albeit much less in-your-face than I was being, and his brother's words meant nothing to him either. It just sucks. This whole post was pretty much pointless haha. 

Maybe convinced me to not bother anymore. I seriously wanted to reason him out of being an asshole."
"Don't kick him out OP!! He probably feels very hurt and upset, and feels like he is being replaced by Joe. Kicking him out would only compound his feelings and make him more angry and resentful. At 17 this is something he needs."
"I'm in a very similar situation to OP. Husband and I are both concerned about his mother, and we helped her out just once by paying her rent one month. SO and I sat down and I just bluntly asked him what he thinks is best for his mother, and we both agreed - she should go back to her home country. 

Problem is, she refuses. Says she won't give in to defeat or whatever. Maybe once she finally runs out of money she'll realize she has no other choices really but until then it's all just her plugging her ears and ignoring the realities of the world. Husband and I have agreed on this: the only time we will offer financial support is in buying a plane ticket to her country, or getting her an appointment with a doctor for her mental health problems (something she also refuses despite needing it desperately). 

Basically, OP and her husband need to be on the same page. That's step one. Whether or not FIL would actually leave, that's a different issue entirely and one they can't do much about. "
But that's the main point.

"Because it is possible she was abusive, I wanted to write as a survivor of abuse. Both my partner and i have suffered really serious abuse, and would avoid places out abuser is at.

If our kid was in the hospital? Not a chance in hell would we stay away. If it was triggering enough, I would tell my partner the person's name so my partner could request they not be allowed in the room/anywhere near us, and I'd be on my goddamn way.

Because no matter what- if my kid needs me, I will be there. 

I can't argue with your desire to walk. No explanation on his part? No prior mention that he has an ex who he will go to these lengths to avoid? If he was abused and it's still that traumatic, why the hell isn't he in therapy?

I'm definitely more suspicious of an affair or a restraining order. 

I would absolutely be, at minimum, doing a separation and serious couples counseling. Provided he own up to what is actually going on.
And if you just want a divorce, you go right ahead.

"Thanks everyone for the clarification, I really appreciate it :)

So to make yourself attractive to women, you're best off coming across as more casual and chilled in general? And if there's a girl you're interested in not to make it clear that you're interested till a while after you've met too I assume?

I'm in a bit of a shitty situation as I'm a 22M virgin. The most I've ever done with women is make out so no further than second base. I was brought up within a super religious environment so it took me a while to come out of my shell. I feel that I used to have better confidence in the way I look but now after getting ghosted on tinder and getting rejected (and ghosted again) by girls at clubs I feel my self confidence has taken a massive knock. I'm wary of coming across as desperate but I really do want a relationship.

What's the best way to come across as ""confident"" in front of women?"
He told me he had been lying the whole time though.
"Because you're considering breaking off the engagement over eyelashes. Over a few little hairs. That is the most insignificant reason. If your relationship is that unstable, end it now."
"Sometimes this sort of thing isn't about control so much as knowing what to expect so alternative plans can be arranged.

For instance, my husband cooks dinner. He prefers to cook due to his dietary restrictions and his never-the-same-two-days-in-a-row schedule. This means we each handle our own small meals, and he cooks the big meal for the day. The big meal might happen at lunch time or at dinner time depending on the schedule for that day. If he says, ""I'm going to cook at X:XX I will arrange my other meals for the day around that. If he cooks it within the hour, great! Everyone is happy. If he gets caught up in something and it doesn't happen for 3-4 hours from when he said it would, I've gotten quite hungry and probably already caved and eaten something, possibly I am no longer even at home. I'm annoyed, and once he realizes I'm not going to eat what he cooks when he cooks it, he's annoyed. 

I don't want to control how or when or what he cooks. I just want to know what to expect so I don't starve. Some people thrive in random unpredictability. Others need some semblance of a predictable outcome."
"I get that you're feeling attacked and can understand if you feel your first comment was misconstrued. But to say 

&gt;The only guilt people are feeling is the guilt they put on themselves. 

is beyond the pale. A postpartum mother is often unable to rationalise her emotions and not feel guilty, especially if there is postpartum depression added to the mix. 

The number of supposed well meaning people pushing for breastfeeding is off the charts. I remember my sister being absolutely hounded about it when she was having difficulties establishing breastfeeding with my nephew. None of it was done in a supportive or encouraging manner whatsoever - it was manipulative guilt tripping and only served to make her feel overwhelmed, guilty and already a failure as a brand new mother. 

Please consider how what you say further negatively contributes to the ""breastfeeding is the only way narrative"" - whatever works for you as a mum and gets your baby thriving is what is best.

&gt;If he was charged and let go then the justice system has dealt with him. Killing someone isn't a big a deal as most people make it out to be its just someone expressing their anger in a different way. I would tell your manager and get a background check processed so you can fire him."
"I can't tell you why shit happens to people who don't deserve it but I can tell you this: family isn't just parents.

I don't know what it's like to be a foster kid but my parents are abusive, emotionally and (when I was younger) physically. As I grew up, I realized you can make your own family. You can have friends that are so close to you, you'd forget that you aren't related. It's going to be a little difficult now - you're very young, but focus on working hard in school, try to make friends, you never know what happens. "
"I once had a bf who had a similar line.  His went ""You're the best I've found so far,"" the implication being that if he found someone ""better"" he'd be with that person.  His comments like that made me feel very insecure and like he had no commitment to our relationship.  Guess what! He didn't and he dumped me for a woman he found more ""exciting.""  So I'm a little bit biased, but I'm a lot older and more self assured now and I would tell that old bf to take a flying ef.   I think your bf is also telling you he has no commitment to the relationship and that he doesn't love you.  He's only in it for what feels good to him."
"Oh fuck this, your bf is a disrespectful piece of shit."
"Well, your boyfriend has revealed something *very* unpleasant about himself.  No, you are not wrong.  No, you are not ""rude.""  Do you know what's *rude?*  INVITING YOURSELF ON A TRIP.

Shut him down.  Tell him you are done talking about it.  When he continues with the passive-aggression, refuse to engage and leave.  He will either stop this shit or reveal even more unpleasantness about himself."
"In theory great idea but I don't really have any friends within walking distance who are gonna let us use their shower everyday and I can't see my mom driving us anywhere for it either, nor do I want to use a camp shower during winter "
"He was trolling/being sarcastic, but you're so wound up in being short that you took it seriously."
"You should absolutely tell them- if she'd hit their kid and you saw it, would you keep it secret? 

Don't worry about causing any family drama- your mother did that herself by hitting your brother's dog, which is animal abuse. "

"I had my cat put down.  After, when I went to pay the vet, I was told that a friend of mine had already paid.  Somehow that meant more to me than flowers or a gift basket would have.    Of course it only works if you know what vet they use."
"I so so so sooooo disagree. I dont see at all how this could be partly blamed on her. That does not make sense at all in my opinion :-S

I understand her reaction completely. It was pure disappointment. 
**Should** she have said something? Maybe, she **could** have. but in no way was it her responsibility to remind him of something soooo fundamental.

I dont think she was ""watching him fail"", i really think she was in total disbelief. i would have been for sure. And i also can imagine that she didnt want to be ""that girlfirend"" who is mad that her BF cant go on a worktrip because of her birthday.
It should have been simply HIS reponsbility to know.

it was the SECOND time on top of it all.


I do agree, communication is important, for sure! you are totally right, but putting even the slightest of blame on the girlfriend is very unfair i think in this situation :-S "
"I'm not on the spectrum, but to suffer from extreme anxiety issues. Certain noises, smells, and lights drive me fucking apeshit. I'm not an angry person, but certain tones can make me irrationally angry. The car booming? I've cried and thrown up over that. I *never* approach strangers in an angry manor, and even surprised my SO by storming out my front door to confront some asshats playing one of those bass stereos. Haha it scares me to think of it now.... point is these are real issues. OP needs to have a talk with her to see what it's doing to her. Tell her he understands that there are real noise sensitivities. "
Yes especially when the younger ones get caught up in fandom wars or whatever. I'm like y'all are obviously kids because I'm trying to balance a 9 to 5 and a full time boyfriend with my kpop life so...
YOUR BF AND HIS FRIEND ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
Whatever angle she had on whatever other guy she was crushing on fizzled is my guess.
"Thanks, it was definitely not fun. I don't think I really even realized how bad it was until I left, when I had an objective look at the whole picture. "
"It's probably an empty threat, but file a police report anyway just to be safe. That way if she pulls any more bullshit (another theft, assault, destroying your property) you'll already have a paper trail on her. 

By the way, whose house are you living in? Can you kick her out? "
"&gt;She promised school would never interfere when I voiced my concerns early on. 

I'm sorry, but this where I heard that 'record-needle-scratch' sound. 

You were concerned that her continuing education and growth as a human being might interfere with her relationship with you? And you expressed those concerns strongly enough that she felt the need to reassure you? 

There's something worth looking at there.

&gt; She promised a lot of things and I told her, I'm letting my guard down to trust her, and she said she wouldn't betray my trust. 

You're using the word 'trust' a lot, but I don't ever get the sense she did anything untrustworthy. She didn't steal money from your bank account, or crash your car, or sleep with other guys. So I don't see any 'betrayal' of trust here...

&gt;Her exact words, two days ago were ""Your love is all I need.""

Yeah, that's called ""romantic language""; it's not meant to be taken literally. She needs oxygen, food, water, social interactions, sunlight, exercise, lots of things beyond you. 

&gt;I feel like an idiot. Every woman I let get close does this. I've been cheated on countless times. Lied to, manipulated and robbed.

Riiiight... but this woman didn't cheat on you, didn't rob you, and I'm not really seeing lying or manipulation except where you've backed her into a corner and insisted she lie or manipulate you so that you felt better.

&gt; All the promises she just broke that revolved around her never leaving me because life got to hectic.

That's... that's not a promise you get to exact from another person. That's not how life works. People get opportunities to work new jobs or in new places, or go to school and learn new things, and it's not fair to demand that they always refuse all of those opportunities just for a relationship. (People can and do *choose* to forgo opportunities for relationships, but the *choice* is key. Un-coerced, free decisions are necessary) 

&gt;After saying all that, I know it might seem like I'm the problem. I know I'm not. 

You know the most dangerous gap in the world? It's the distance between what you *actually* know, and what you *think you know*. 

&gt; I spoil the ones I love and make them feel like queens.

Maybe you should try making them feel like human beings.

&gt;Looking back now though, it does feel like if something happens over and over again, how can it not be my fault?

How does the joke go? The one thing all of your ex-'s have in common is **you**.

OK, enough criticism. On to the helpful stuff. 

1.) Hit the gym. If you have a gym membership, great. If not, get one. Low-frills gyms, or your local Parks &amp; Recreation district, or community college all have inexpensive options. Get exercising. Basic cardio, 3/week. It'll help with unwanted thoughts, it will improve your brain chemistry, and you'll sleep better.

2.) Make a list of things you've always wanted to try. Skills, things to learn, that sort of stuff. Kickboxing, cooking, hiking, guitar, etc. Find classes (again, Parks &amp; Rec or Community college) where you can learn these things. Find activities you can do that let you feel awesome about yourself, but are also somewhat social, involving other people who are interested in the thing that you are interested in. 

3.) Learn to be OK inside your own skin. This is harder than it sounds. Therapy helps, but you might not be ready for that. So for now, work on feeling good (#1 helps) and finding things that make you feel awesome. (#2) Being single can be really great, and you should try and find the things that feel good about being single. (Going the movies by yourself means never sharing an armrest)

You'll never find a person who will be comfortable with you until you're comfortable with yourself. You'll never be able to really connect with another person until you're able to love yourself. I know, it sounds corny, but it's true. I've been married twice, and gone through a few long term relationships before that, and I've seen how they all went wrong. "
Hit the nail right on the head with that one.  That's exactly how I feel about the situation.
"Surely there's something she hates about you and yet you're so lucky she stayed with you. Seriously, if you hate her name how did you ever get this far? Get over it or dump her if it's seriously an issue. Life is too short to worry about stupid shit like this."
"Sigh.  All relationships are a constant negotiation of expectations, needs, and- you got it- rules.  That is literally the hallmark of ALL healthy relationships.

And the definition of poly is NOT ""has one primary partner and other non-primaries"". Plenty of poly people do not have primary partners.  Sorry, friend.  You're not a special and unique snowflake with your newfangled relationship system that we poor repressed monogamous people just don't understand.  "
I feel like living with an unbearable cheating fiance that has no concern for you would be way worse than living with a mother that is almost unbearable to live with. You will be ok. Leave for the happiness of your child and yourself.
"It's his brother, who he loves and is FAMILY,not just some random buddy. "
"**Let him know how much his support has meant to you**, and then do something that you would ordinarily do to make him feel appreciated. Does he like gifts? Buy him something nice. Does he appreciate quality time? Find some time for just the two of you, maybe even a weekend trip. Does he like verbal affection? physical? give those to him. Does he appreciate favors/gifts of service? find some that he could use (run an errand or two, or do something around the house for him)."
"Yeah come on dude this honestly isn't worth your time. If someone is willing to be petty like this with small things they'll be petty with big things eventually. I couldn't imagine doing this to someone because it's so stupid - it's not like she did something horrible, she just was ridiculous immature and manipulative. Dump her as fast as you can "
Less hot night roleplaying ever
"And I'm sure that will all be very helpful when he ends up in the hospital and she suddenly has no rights to see him or make decisions about his care because she's not family. Or if he dies and she has no claim to the life they built together. Marriage is practical; it gives you legal protections, rights, and responsibilities. It's not all fairy tales and sparkles, it's the way our society is set up in the majority of the world."
"Yeah, be gentle, but it sounds like you're dealing with someone who has recently become homeless."
Also that statistic is completely outdated/false. The divorce rate is way down from its peak in I think the 80s. Also if you are a college educated person it's even lower I think around 20-30%. I didn't look up that number but still the chances of divorce between two educated people (as op and bf are) is no where near 50%. 
"Not a ""good chance"", but much higher than the general population. It has a strong hereditary component, but:

""Individuals with a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) who has schizophrenia have a 10 percent chance of developing the disorder, as opposed to the 1 percent chance of the general population."" - Understanding Schizophrenia

Not that I'm suggesting they should be having children, they definitely shouldn't bring a child in to such an unstable environment, I'm just clarifying the facts."
"Wow, it sounds like you could have been me 15 years ago, sans the stepdad crush. Like you, I went to a high school that was very focused around sports (football - We won the state championship 3 years in a row - and basketball - one of my classmates is even in the NBA). I was also very into academics, art, and certain niche TV shows. You're a smart person, so I'm not going to talk down to you or sugar coat the truth.

&gt;That it's just a crush and it will pass but it doesn't seem to be going away. The more I get to know him, the stronger it gets.

Crushes can last a long time, so just because it's been a year, doesn't mean it's love. What you need to make it go away is distance.

&gt;And the few guys that are more academic just fall so short when I compare them mentally to Teddy (I know that I shouldn't do that and it's obviously not a fair comparison, but it happens automatically).

Yeah, it's unfair to compare guys you've known for a long time (perhaps from middle or even elementary school) with the shiny new older guy that is so mature by comparison, wants to impress you, and just seems to just get you. However, you need to realize that he is putting in a lot of effort to make a good impression on you because he loves your mom and he knows that your opinion matters a lot if he wants to get anywhere with her. 

&gt;I want to get over this crush, but I don't want to distance myself from the guy that might soon be my step-dad. And it would be something that he'd notice if I did and he'd think he did something wrong which I don't want either

I think you need to be honest with yourself. You don't want to distance yourself from him because he might soon be your step-dad. You don't want to distance yourself from him because you have a crush on him, and it makes you feel good to be around him. I'm not saying avoid him like the plague. I'm saying it would be healthier (and you will get over him faster) to stop spending as much time with him. Start studying at the library and spend more time with your friends. Hell, meet new friends (including male friends you haven't known for half of forever). Fill out your school and social calendar. When he asks you to go somewhere, just say that ""Sorry, but I have to study for X exam"" or ""Sorry, but I'm going out to the movies with Angela and Beth on that day"" or something. You're 16; if you suddenly seem too busy for Teddy, Teddy is not going to take it personally. He'll just assume that you're going through a natural teenage phase of wanting to hang out with your peers."
"&gt; and BLAM the door just shut on that relationship. There is no coming back from that.

Yep, now it's just a matter of how much more of her life does OP waste on this douchebag. Because obviously, she knows it's wrong or wouldn't post here, but she doesn't have the self-esteem to not have needed to post here and to just have left him then and there.

I'm guessing 3-4 years, sadly. Source: been there"
You should have kept reading. He also brought up her ex-boyfriend who *did* kill himself. He needs to do some serious work on himself before he gets back on a dating website!
"&gt;  I mentally compare the guys my friends talk about being into against him and tally up how they don't compare...I say that I sleep in his clothes because they're comfy but it's so I can smell his cologne while I sleep (and some of his cologne may have somehow found its way onto a few stuffed animals of mine...). I love cuddling with him while we're watching tv ...And I have a lot of very... explicit thoughts about him quite regularly.

If I were to try to list ways to turn a crush into an obsession, I'm not sure I could come up with a better list."
"I don't want to sow resentment or doubt in your mind but it is suspicious if this is a totally sudden thought, along with the immediate frustration on her end. Most couples (including my relationship) I know that are open have flowed into it pretty easily out of mutual interest and relationship history. I'm not saying she's cheating at all, likely she's not but it seems like someone is in her mind. I think it's possible to work through it, with a ton of dedication to honesty and determination. My relationship is open but it would not work at all if one person was against or resentful of it. And we both still have our boundaries and jealousies to work with. It's not for one partner to be into and one not. 
"
"I think he's taking his pillows and casserole too seriously. It isn't like she was insulting his personality, his looks or his sexual aptitude. I'm sure my SO laughs with his friends about some of the more ridiculous things I do and frankly it doesn't bother me at all - it IS funny and not really personal. 

Unless she meant it maliciously, it doesn't necessarily have to be mean-spirited. Obviously it hurt the OP's feelings and he should address that, but unless you think you're so sacred that nothing you do can possibly be funny to others, I still don't think this is a massive deal. "
"Yep, that's what I'm thinking."
"What OP is experiencing seems a bit different than dating someone who happens to have a roommate of the opposite sex.

His gf informs him one day that she's considering bringing in a roommate. She is deliberately vague about who this person is. OP must pry the fact that it is a male from her. He expresses misgivings, discomfort about this arrangement. Before they even have a chance to discuss the matter, the dude is already living in her house. If you would be comfortable with this situation, then you are likely the exception"
"You need to talk about this some more for sure because you're jumping to a lot of conclusions and freaking out over the future of the relationship more than you should. All you know is that when you put him on the spot, he didn't want to use the toy on you. You don't know that he isn't into any kind of kinky stuff, or even that he wouldn't be into a different variety of butt stuff, etc. 

While I do think a lot of guys (or most guys) would be interested in anal sex, or at least that's the stereotype, it's definitely still in the category of sex things that you need to talk about before you try to get the other person to do them in the moment. 

He may well have just never done what you were asking him to do before and didn't want to look like he didn't know what he was doing in the bedroom or end up driving you to the ER while you sit on a bunch of towels. "
"Your brother is an asshole.  You will not be able to change him but the company you keep says a lot about what you will and will not tolerate in life - kind of an external moral compass.

He has caused A LOT of pain and suffering to women DELIBERATELY and thinks it is funny.  You tolerate it now because you are removed from the fall out of his behaviour.  But how would you feel if a female friend or relative met a guy like your brother and was treated the way he treats women?  Then left, hurt and upset by him?

In addition, those girls that he does that too - that was your GF once.  The guy who cheated on her and hurt her - he was just like your brother.

TBH if my bf had a friend like your brother I would lose respect for him if he continued to hang out with him, ignoring the fact that he is a total dick. 

You are not obliged to cut ties with him - but you are going to have to accept that your gf may not want to continue a relationship with someone who passively supports (due to your acceptance of) his behaviour.

EDIT -  my ex housemate had a penchant for hitting on guys who had girlfriends.  Trying to get them to cheat and then leave their gf.  I hated it and did not agree with her behaviour so in the end I told her if she did it again I would have to give her notice to leave as I could not tolerate this.  She ended up moving out after getting herself pregnant by a guy who had a gf.  "
You're allowed to be angry.
"Good! This is going to take time, maybe a lot of time, don't expect progress quickly and don't get disheartened if he goes backwards sometimes."
"You're absolutely right, his family doesn't need to know. I was more thinking about how he might react himself if therapy is suggested.. That's what worries me.

Thank you for your help."
"He anally raped that girl, and he flat out told you he doesn't care about consent with one night stands.

You are dating a rapist."
"A comment on the ""it was just a joke"" idea. The assumption there is that the ""joke"" is that they made you think something worse was going to happen to you, but stopped before doing so. That is, that grabbing you was okay because it was not ""past a line"" and nothing really happened, and the joke was that they didn't take it further. But that entirely misses the point...  

Grabbing you in the first place was already past the line. The joke was over the moment they grabbed you. They were already past the line and committing a real criminal assault. That physical act alone has already injured you. Don't let them or the cops redraw that line for you. They attacked you and should be dealt with as such."
"&gt; please don't give up on her, she needs you right now. 

Repeating this for those in the back that couldn't hear"
"You say she abandoned him. If you give him back now you will double his trauma in the cruelest possible way.

Unless he is yelling every day to go back, returning him like a broken CD player is an utterly inhumane thing to do."
"OK, well honestly, I think your body language is probably acting as your unintended cock block. how is a girl going to think you like her if you flinch when she gets near you? That kind of body language signals disgust and is going to drive women away. No woman is going to hang out or hook up with a guy who seems to be disgusted by her.

You need to do the things that other people are suggesting, just become more comfortable around women without having any expectations of getting laid. women are not a separate species. "
"Ok I don't know if it's necessarily yours or not, but definitely get a paternity test and stay the fuck away from her. Pregnant or not, she's crazy. I don't use that word lightly with women since it's such a shitty stereotype, but this one is definitely nuts."
"Doesn't even have to be a large hospital. The hospital in my city of 10k has both geropsych and adult psych units. Slightly bigger city 1 hour away with 25k has both of those and an adolescent unit. And this is in the south US, typically behind everyone else as far as mental healthcare goes. "
"My loser brother is extremely controlling and used to want to be a cop.  When he was telling me he was applying, he said, ""That would be so cool.  Like, if I was out driving around the patrol car and I saw my friends, I could just pull them over!""  He was 27.  Never made the police force.  Shocking, I know.  He has since become a security guard.  Again, shocking."
"My ex was exactly like this too: I'd send him a YouTube video of a band I thought he'd like. There would be all kinds of eye-rolling, deep sighing, whining and finally: ""Okay fine I'll listen to it but *you owe me*."" 

Because apparently everything I liked was just so terrible they he needed to be compensated for the time he wasted 'indulging me.' 

What is up with guys like this? Why do they exist?"
It seems very concerning to me.. it sounds quite possible it could lead to an abusive relationship or assault. She also seems like she could be susceptible to being caught in a relationship like that. I unfortunately don't have any advice because I just don't know. I would be very careful about betraying her trust on the issue because that could easily end the friendship and any ability to help. 
I would agree with this if he hadn't said that thing about her masturbating next to him and dry-humping his leg. That's just not something to be taken lightly. She doesn't respect him or care about him at all. I think he needs to cut her off. 
"&gt;This is where wires start to cross. Sometimes she'll respond in less than 30 minutes... sometimes she's North of 1/2 day.... or not at all (the next message acts as if there was nothing before).
The thing is, when we are hanging out - she almost ALWAYS has her phone and is reading her texts when they hit. I've seen her do this countless times.

Are the texts you send her during work hours when she has other commitments and can't stay glued to her phone? If so, that may be reasonable that she doesn't get back to you as quickly. 

You guys have been together two years, so if I were in her shoes, I would think you were just sending something nice and you didn't necessarily need to be validated by a response. Maybe what you need to tell her is that you enjoy communicating with her during the day and would like it if she would text you more often. I wouldn't get any more aggressive than that. Because unfortunately you do sound needy, and if you press her too hard on always responding, she may start to push back and feel like she needs space. "
"Yeah my MIL was worried that we would give our daughter a bad name so we never told her so she wouldn't have a chance to complain. No one is going to tell a cute little baby they have a stupid name, especially once its on the birth certificate. "
"OP, **you don't mention anything wrong with the sex due to his lack of girth.** In comments you say that he turns you on a great deal. It sounds like you're used to getting a lot of visual stimulation from looking at a partner's equipment, but it doesn't even sound like missing that with this guy is affecting your overall enjoyment of sex. I think you're over-thinking this, and blowing it way out of proportion. When you two have sex, focus on the things you really like about him and his body, and maybe even spend less time looking at his penis until you're less in-your-head about it."
"Haha well I hope you're right! I have no idea how to act though or if there's physical signs from him I should be looking for? Idk, I really don't want to blurt out ""hey, I like your face. Let's make out"" but I'm so bad at being flirty I just have no idea lol"
"You're entitled to that benefit, not taking it is like leaving money on the table! While he could support you fully,  why would you want him to do so when there's an official program that can help too? "
"&gt;because I find it SO SATISFYING to talk to people who feel the same way, since I spent a couple of years surrounded by that mentality. 

You and me both. It's extra creepy, too, because they slip it in under the guise of consent culture when it's anything but. And if you try to point out how fucking creepy and inappropriate they're being, you're either ""kink-shaming"" or like, brainwashed by our culture, man.

&gt;and I bet they did it in such a ""nice"" way that she feels confused and guilty about being uncomfortable

Dollars to donuts this is true. Especially because she's so young and she did really like them. Gross, gross creeps."
"TIL wanting to only have sex in committed relationships is putting your vagina on a pedestal and will drive men away.  

Listen up ladies!!!! Want a real man and to find that prince charming for yourself? Start sleeping with everyone you know!!  

Seriously though, it sounds like this commenter is bitter because he never gets laid. "
"Thanks guys, never really wanted to use it as an excuse, definitely intend to supliment the medication with hard work to address my shortcomings. "
"Is being disabled from a car crash really on par with doing an internship while in grad school? An internship that op has been preparing for by saving up, as well.

Also, how is he not supporting her? Cheap rent and buying all her groceries, and paying for her to go out sometimes? I'm not sure what I'm missing, that seems incredibly generous."
I live in an old farm town. The most polite word I can use for old farmers is cantankerous. He will probably be kind of a dick to you no matter what. I feel like being self reliant has instilled a strong sense of us vs. Them and literally everyone who isn't their family is Them. Just try to be polite and limit contact and stay off his lawn.
"Brides traditionally have way more control over the ceremony and reception, so just the regular wedding cake could be considered the bride's cake."
"Hypocritical? First, the boyfriend didn't say go fuck your roommate behind my back. He had a dream to have consensual sex between the three of them. You're comparing apples to oranges. Even if things progressed and they did all three hook up, I guarantee you later on he'd still be pissed she had sex with her without his permission beforehand. That is a definitive breach of trust. Threatening to cheat in return is not a surprising comment to react with after being betrayed by the person you love most. No. It's not more malicious than her actions of actually cheating. What kind of drugs are you on? Why is he mad? His girl fucked someone else behind his back. Cheating in return is a moot point because the relationship was severed the moment she cheated. It's already over. 

A) Cheating has already been defined for monogamous relationships. His standards were no different. At this point, you are officially an idiot. His mood is irrelevant considering her actions. These are natural anger mechanisms to someone betraying you after Five years. 
B, C, and D) You finally came back to your senses and null your own case against the bf by claiming she is a cheater. Well Done. "

The life expectancy for outdoor cats is like a decade less than indoor only. I'd be mad if you suggested that to me too. 
"Partying, having casual relationships, sleeping around....none of those things make someone an asshole. However, getting married, committing to a monogamous relationship, then cheating and *also* leading the other person on...that really makes someone an asshole. And he didn't do those things when he was ""younger"", he did those things when he was in his early 30s. He did those things not that long ago. Those are the kinds of actions of someone who is fairly emotionally immature. 

Like I said in my other comment, sounds like you have never really trusted him. You just talked yourself into it. And now that other people are knowing about the kind of person you are with and what he's done in the past you can no longer justify it to yourself. 

Now, I believe people can change. However, I don't think you should jump into marriage with this guy. You should probably slow things *way* down. "
"I understand you aren't arguing that it's not a shitty thing. I'm telling you at least how I perceive it could be a deal breaker. A person who does a shitty thing because they can't help it is not the same as a person who does a shitty thing knowing he's being shitty and affecting other people, and choosing to do it anyway.

We do not have reason to believe anything like this has happened, but we do know that OP has noticed his behavior with waiters and waitresses before. 

Like you, I do not agree she should up and end it with him. I think she should talk to him and see what his thought process is. This *is* a big red flag, though. It's very unlikely that he's aloof; it's much more likely that he doesn't mind being shitty to people if it serves him. 

But she should make sure (at least, if she has an interest in continuing this relationship)."
Jesus the butt dildo ambush was pretty abrupt no wonder things got weird so fast.  This may be a shock but men are not all alike.  I know its shocking.  But some guys like butt stuff and some don't.  You made things weird when you ambushed him and then you got all upset at the rejection.  Sure he didn't handle things great but a lot of the awkwardness comes from he way you have handled things.
That's really great!! Thanks for letting me know :) 
"She gave her the ""non-apology"" by saying "" I was sorry if she felt bad from what I said ""

Op, that is not an apology. "
Should I call the police next time she shows up or should I go to the precinct now? I'm not sure how to approach this
"I agree he needs counseling. He's bottling it up and spacing out. He's playing video games and Redditing like normal but without communicating. 

No I can't have sex yet. I had a third degree perineal tear. I can blow him though and do multiple times a week. I reject reciprocation when he tries. He doesn't always try. Sometimes he goes back to sleep. I can live with this for now. 

I think what I just want is for him not to space out. When I went to change and feed her last night, he actually snatched her back when he realized and told me it wasn't his fault I was PMSing. Which I am but I didn't think that had anything to do with changing her shit pillow so it was no longer full of shit. I was too tired and just cried quietly. He hoisted her back when he was done. "
"What he did was shitty - not because he hit you, really, because I can get a reflexive lashing out when you are trying to stop someone from crossing your physical boundaries, but because he obviously didn't regret it or care that he seriously hurt you. If it had been a reflexive defense, he'd have been immediately remorseful.  I agree with the other posters that this relationship is not a good one.

However.  For your next relationship.  When you were poking and tickling him, and he was laughing - did he ever in the midst of the squirming and giggling say the word ""stop?"" Laughter doesn't mean enjoyment. Tickling for some people is like torture. They can't control their reactions and it feels really horrible. I personally hate it. But I'd still laugh because that's what tickling does.  If someone says stop, whether they seem serious or not, you fucking stop.  "

"If he had just told her, ""Hey, I got my ex pregnant when we were together, I was shitty, and she got an abortion ..."" that would've been one thing, but he gave her the nitty gritty details of what *I* went through during that time. Not his version, which would be all he really owes her. 

&gt; If the tables were turned and it was his new GF asking here ""my bf lied about getting his ex pregnant and abandoning her"" you better believe people would advice that this should've been shared (and a massive red flag).

I feel like that's more of a statement on /r/relationships as a sub than anything else. And there's a difference between lying about something vs. sharing a version of the events that doesn't humiliate the other person involved. "

Lastly, give the casual sexism a break before it gets you into trouble. Your entire post is so patronizingly anti woman its laughable.  Men are just as likely to cheat as women for exactly the same reasons. No one, male or female, is capable of making someone cheat. Cheating is a choice. "

The bladder symptom alone is alarming, and when combined with the daytime sleepiness, it makes me suspect that something else is going on with her body.

Good luck to you both. "

If you prefer the attention of a guy with no sense of boundaries, compared to your boyfriend then break up with your boyfriend. Your boyfriend may not be respected by your male friend, but show your boyfriend some respect and leave him.

If you want to rekindle things with your boyfriend, stop hanging out with the douche guy, who is really not your friend, and start showing your boyfriend you love him and want to be with him. It might surprise you that he will stop acting clingy when you stop acting distant from him due to your daydreaming about banging the the other guy.

Just a side note: if any of my guy friends had a girl who said he wasn't ""allowed"" to text/talk to me, you can bet I'd be hostile. My friends are important to me, male and female. "

He needs a wake up call, stat, because things are serious. This is dealbreaker territory in my opinion.

Like, what does that even mean in the context of an insult? 

There is NO excuse in my opinion. He used the word Jewish to describe you negatively because in his eyes, being Jewish is a negative trait. Even his apology of saying he was caught off guard basically translates into ""I've always bitten my tongue even though I always wanted to tell you how I don't like you being Jewish, but I was caught off guard so I let my guard down and said what was really in my head"".

My kids both called every adult male they saw 'daddy' or 'grandpa' for a while. It's really common.  Good luck.
"&gt; He told me he didnt want to continue the relationship because he thinks the issues will come full circle and we will be back here again, and he doesnt want that because the pain of thinking about breaking up is too much.

How about calling him your ex? Not wanting to continue a relationship is basically breaking up. It's only been five months and you should be in the honeymoon period. However, you've got lots of issues already now... doesn't look like you're really compatible.

&gt; Another thing is he also seems to consider our fights much worse than they actually are.

Stop berrating his feelings. He has another point of view and there's no right or wrong. Seriously, you're 29 years old. Focus on yourself for a while, work on your insecurities and your communication skills.

This situation is 0% about your MIL's sense of guilt, and it's 100% about your grief due to her deliberate betrayal of your instructions.

My wife comes first, and if she doesn't want our kids around someone or doesn't trust them, or if someone ignores her rules, I will put them on an immediate time-out in that they don't get to be in contact with my family until my wife and I both feel ready.

I'm not in touch with my family anymore, and so there are many times still when I pity myself and feel sad and alone and jealous of other people and their families. And I think those feelings are natural and normal. I don't know if I will ever fully stop having such feelings, but I have other stuff going on to distract myself and/or make life worthwhile despite the gaping lack-of-family hole. I also suggest learning about mental health, seeing a therapist, or journaling, which have all helped me a lot. Best wishes! I'm rooting for you!"

Because of him, i have been able to include my boyfriend, who grew up very poor with no father and a horrible monster of a mother and shitty siblings, in my big, loving family.


All you have to do is create your own. This is a very short but difficult time in your life. Stay positive and make the right moves for yourself, and you'll make your own family eventually. Do what my grandpa did. 

It's very doable. Keep your head up. The bright side of being a foster kid is insurance, payments, college should be mostly covered, etc. etc.  There's long term benefits, if you think of it positively. You can build your own family. Watch ""meet the robinsons"" by disney, if you haven't already seen it. 

See if you can get yourself into some kind of therapy or counseling with your insurance, try talking to a school guidance counselor or something. Work through these feelings now so they don't manefist later as bad habits or anger at the world.

I've learned from my experiences and have worked to not be a terrible person anymore."" I'd think it way more of a red flag if he didn't tell her.

I absolutely agree that it's great OP is no longer with him. He was an absolute despicable ass to her and that kind of hurt will always be there. But that doesn't mean he can't change and that he doesn't deserve a chance with someone else."
"Even if she *didn't* know how you'd react, even if this was a huge surprise to her -- it was *still* completely an accident. You felt bad that she was hurt, apologized, and took her to get cared for, and there's nothing more to ""take responsibility"" for. 

Anyone who gets mad at you for an accident that you already empathized with her about is way over-focused on her own feelings as the only indicator of what's right and wrong. She's hurt, therefore *you* wronged *her* because in her world, there has to be someone to blame.

Unless she's just immature and can truly learn from this experience (including a huge apology and clear understanding of how she is wrong), this is not someone you want to go through the random trials of life (illness, car accident, god forbid childbirth) with.

If you do decide you can reconcile, be careful not to imply ""you *knew* this would happen, so it's partly your fault"" and instead focus on ""you know now that I had no intention of hurting you, so you shouldn't be mad.""

"Yep. Those good, sexy months, she and her ""ex"" were having a rough patch. Now they've made up and she wants to stay, but wants you waiting in the wings in case it falls through. All those excuses to avoid sex are absolute nonsense. She's feeding you pretty lies about a future that won't happen."
"Legitimate exes don't have to keep their new lovers secret. Single parents are allowed to have new SOs without ""being taken to court"". 

BTW, the custody nonsense is a GREAT way for her to keep extending lies and deadlines. This will never end.  "
"Trying to fix things with an abuser is a bad idea. Also, where do you get that OP doesn't give his GF affection, love, reassurance, respect, wonder or praise? His Gf sounds like a black hole that devours all his love without giving anything positive back, and that always needs more and is never satisfied. His GF seems to have huge problems. OP should immediately break up. "
"Don't let her live with you. I know that's hard but you know she will just drag you down with her and you need to draw a line rather than go down with the ship. Stop trying to solve her problems for her and enable her dependent behaviors. Tell her she can't live with you and it isn't up for discussion. Seriously, don't set your family on fire to keep her warm. "
"Nope. Love is never enough.

Successful relationships take communication, kindness, respect, shared values, patience, lust, love, validation, and about a hundred other things. Love is just one component. 

It's like trying to make bread with nothing but some butter. Yes, you need butter to make bread, but no matter how hard you try, you can't ever turn butter into bread. "
