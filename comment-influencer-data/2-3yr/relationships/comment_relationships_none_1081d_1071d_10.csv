"I agree with what everyone else has said about something potentially traumatic happening. I mean, it could be anything, but definitely approach it carefully. 

On a side-note, you're way too young to be talking about marriage in the near future. Focus on your education/career and growing as a person. If things were meant to be, you can still get married in a few years from now once your relationship has been tested by the inevitable ups and downs of life. "
" Be picky, and be OK with being alone for a time. "
"She is not his responsibility. He can ""care about her"" all he wants as long as you are okay with him harboring those feelings. It isn't smart or necessary to put himself in this situation. It isn't his job to help her anymore, she has a husband who can help her. It is inappropriate. I wonder if her husband knows she is seeking your boyfriends help.  I wouldn't be surprised if this study session turns into a marriage counseling session. Why him? Why now? He doesn't need to be the one to help her. "
"You seem to lack basic human empathy. You clearly dont see a long term relationship with her so thats why its a waste of time.      
If you have to hide something from your partner its a pretty sure sign that you shouldnt be doing it.  "

"Posted a similar response earlier, but women with large breasts are already very aware that breast reduction surgery is a surgical procedure that exists. Often this gets touted as the catch-all solution to any sort of problems that we might have that relate to our bodies. It gets pretty exhausting to have strangers suggesting an invasive, body-altering surgery to you apropos of nothing."
The one girl I heard it the most from was someone who read tons of those romance novels. The kind that has Fabio on the front of them. 
"I kinda felt the same way during my wife's first pregnancy. All of the changes in her body just threw me off, and the immensity of the changes I was preparing for in my own life just all contributed to like zero sex drive. I don't know why, but with kid number 2 a switch flipped and I couldn't get enough. And even more so with kid number 3. 

Look, you have a lot to process, and while there is a ton of understanding and support out there for pregnant women, guys can be left to sort out all of these changes and feelings on their own. Just take a moment and collect your thoughts before you explain this to your wife. You can be honest and considerate at the same time. "
"Mhm. I slept with my bf before we were official and have been having sex a few times a week ever since. 
It's been 3 years. I don't feel like I don't have standards. "
"Yeah, but OP has eczema, which is way beyond just ""sensitive skin"". All hair removal creams warn users not to use at all on skin that's prone to becoming inflamed or broken - which is exactly what an eczema flare-up does."
"&gt;and have been having some temper flare ups and it leads to depression and anxiety because I then feel like the world's biggest a-hole afterwards

I'm going to be honest. It is insanely difficult being with someone who has PTSD, especially when it's untreated. Even if you aren't directing the anger *at* her, you are likely still scaring her deeply and making her feel insecure about her safety. This is entirely fair for her to feel if you are walking around yelling and punching holes in walls or breaking things. 

&gt;My point is that I'm going to try to do whatever it takes to get better so I can show her how much she truly means to me

No. Focus on getting better for **you**. Not for someone else, but so that **you** have a better quality of life overall. 

Give her the space she needs to figure out what she needs to figure out. That's really all you can do about that. 


"
"No he didn't, it was a joke. Benjen isn't Daario, that would be a terrible plot-twist. "
"You said somewhere you're not curious and you don't feel like you missed out on hooking up with random people. You obviously know how you feel better than we do, but I will say you don't push yourself to the point that you leave a bar to have sex with a girl who isn't your fiancee if you're not curious. 

It's okay if you're curious or if you *were* curious until Monday night happened. Just, know that it's important to acknowledge these things otherwise you will likely have more ""almost"" situations in the future. "
"I get the occasional sexy pic from my GF and immediately reply ""Can I call in sick to work?""

She always says no and assures me she'll be wearing the same thing when I get home...then follows through. And as a strange coincidence, I always work faster on those days. 

But the point is that you're correct. Sometimes you don't need to say much to get the point across about how much you appreciate the pic."
"How can your fianc√©e never come up in conversation? I have interests and hobbies, but the most important person in my life is my SO. He will naturally come up in conversation. It makes me think it's less ""innocent"" and ""harmless"" than OP is making it sound. It boggles my mind. "
"That is a distinct possibility, but wouldn't the aunt have made it clear somehow that the OP and sister should use the money for their parents rather than themselves? You'd be naive to expect them to intrinsically know that's what the money was for without telling them somehow."
"The only way you will actually get good advice is to ask a real doctor. Take a picture of your sister and then fake pain somewhere and go to your doctor that your family normally takes you to. Show him the picture and ask what you can do or what you should do to talk to your parents. Also Google an ED stands for eating disorder hotline that might help guide you. Is it possible she's really sick and lost a bunch of weight as opposed to ED? If that was the case your sister and parents should fill you in, tell them that."
"Yeah, I mean she might buy a plane ticket and turn up at his place of work. Nah, never going to happen!"
"I honestly don't know. 

Would I feel bad if he died thinking his only daughter hates him? Maybe. Maybe not. He wouldn't be wrong. I don't really feel anything and it's very confusing. "
"My advice to you is give her a timeline of what you are thinking for the future. For example: I would like to be engaged in one year and married in two years, then start trying for a baby after the honeymoon. 

Maybe a timeline like that with substance will make her calm down since she has some kind of idea where you are. 

If she still has the ""baby right now crazies"" after that, it might be time to reevaluate your relationship status, because you aren't ready for a baby in the next nine months. "
That sounds like the usual household routine that most people have to fit in around their full time jobs every single day.
Based on your comments all I can say is WOW. You are truly a selfish man. I feel bad for your wife and unborn child. Have fun destroying their lives.
"Worth remembering that this threat came up when they were dating, and they've been married for 6 years. OP's wife would have been 24 or younger when she wrote that. I'm not saying she doesn't still feel the same, but I was a lot less emotionally stable in my early 20s than I am now in my 30s. OP needs to talk to his wife. No more ""probing"" but an honest conversation. "
"So you've already broken up with her once because it was going too *well*? Between that and the lack of trust here, I'd be pretty fed up if I were your GF."
"True, and some of his complaints that many of us might have  who have jobs in offices with colleagues  (i.e. dealing with colleagues and in general having to show up and do what others tell you). It would be worth exploring a bit more with him - is it the topic that's boring him, or his general daily work flow? I.e. too much spreadsheets or too much X or not enough  Y. Some of those can be rectified by a different company or a slightly different function within the same field.

I get the concern about the ""grass is always greener"" syndrome, and I wonder if he's not nostalgic for student days (hard work but you set your own schedule and can smoke pot) or else having a mild freak out along the lines of ""I thought real life would be more fun, instead I have 40 more years of showing up on time and doing XYZ to look forward to, what am I doing with my life.""

Another aspect is that we are often told growing up that we should have jobs we find fulfilling... having a steady, well-paying job being sufficient for happiness  is IMHO a hallmark of previous generations but not the one currently entering the workforce."
"The most attracted I've ever been towards someone I dated is a guy nobody else I know would find attractive.  And I was attracted to him pretty instantly, and just got more and more so the more I got to know him.  (Of course, it helped that the sex was amazing lol....)"
"You said one year or you walk. And then you didn't. So he has no reason to propose, since you just stick around with the status quo. 


Though, do you want someone to propose under duress?"
"He doesn't want to make it right. That's why he's putting the task of coming up with a way to make it right all on you. 

The trust is gone. There is no relationship now. He decided to kill it. No point in trying to keep it going if you are just going to end up worrying of he is where he says he is. "
"I can't have kids (I can get pregnant as far as I know, but I can't physically carry a pregnancy). I just say ""I can't have kids"" and people usually regret asking right away. It's such a personal question but so many people don't realise that. "
"Yes, it's so easy that the term ""Maternal Mortality"" doesn't even exist. /s"
May I suggest a babymoon? Last trip as a couple unencumbered by having to worry about kids. Lots of couples enjoy it.
But would he earn more than You+Him in the city? because you may NEVER find work in TinyTown
"People can have fears yes, but they need to come up with reasonable ways to deal with their fears. Telling your husband he needs to get rid of his dog is not reasonable and it doesn't help you with your fear, it's just demanding that the world cater to you. If you were afraid of the dark and demanded to sleep with the lights on and keep all the lights on in the house all of the time that wouldn't help you with your fears either. If you're afraid to leave the house you can't just demand that your husband goes to fetch you everything and does all the work to support you guys just because you're afraid, etc. 

What you're doing about the dog right now is just as unreasonable. "
"You are totally right in cutting her out of your life.  She's doing a horrible thing.  Just stay away from her.  I don't know who is telling you to forgive her and move on, but I don't see where they're coming from at all.  And you already are moving on it seems.  "
"*Ground* luke? no. Make his life a living hell. He is an asshole. You know what? if he'd admit to it at the start, yeah, grounding would be fine. But he let his brother go through this shit and then laugh when he gets caught (probably because he was high but still)? asshole."
"What??? What counselor would take the side of the crazy person who fully admitted out loud she would've lied to get an innocent woman fired? In what possible way could Valerie be seen as being in the right, here? Even before she admitted she would've lied to OP's company about Heather, she already had another person at the office harassing Heather on Valerie's behalf. How could this *possibly* be spun? "
"Acouple of scenarios, none of which end well for your girlfriend.

1. she lied about it, does not trust you and wanted to out you. Dump her.

2. She is protecting someone who tried to hurt you both.  Dump her.

3.  She is so non confrontational that she does not want to tell you who MP is because then MP will know.  Her priorities are fucked. Dump her.

In fact your going to have to work really hard not to dump her. (lock stock)


No matter how you slice it, your girlfriend either does not trust you, or is too immature to be in a relationship. "
What the fuck is wrong with OP's friends O_o
Damn...... Dan and especially the brother sounds like asses 
"Your mom is starting a problem she has no business starting.

You already stated he's a wonderful husband and father. If something is bothering you, sit down with your husband, *not* your mother. She's leading to you to believe your children are going to be messed up because of their father's personality, and that's unfair. I'm sure he doesn't even notice. 

Like I said, talk to your husband, not your mom. It's unfair to him. As you pointed out earlier, no one's good enough for your parents, so that might have something to do with it too. He shouldn't have to kiss their asses - your mom not liking the reactions he gives is her personal problem, and it sounds like her judgement is clouding yours. 

I'm sure if you spoke with him he would be glad to do right by you, but you have to back him up too. "
"She wants to cuddle.  If you can't just cuddle, then don't go."
"I think the idea is that if the emotional energy you are putting into a relationship that's not your primary, its cheating. And yes, there have absolutely been cases in this sub where the emotional cheating is still platonic but having a negative impact on the romantic relationship. 

"
"&gt; She cheated on me a year ago and it hurt me deeply. She lied about it when she got caught and only started telling me the truth 2 months later. Even then she downplayed what really happened, so ive had trust issues since.  
  
You shouldn't have stayed with this person. I hope the child is not yours, insist on the paternity test."
"WHAT? She's 4, even without the scary mask, being afraid at night is a normal part of childhood. But has to be helped, certainly without any type of supplement."
"I would end the relationship. That's rape. He never even asked your consent.

Whatever his reason may be, it doesn't matter. This is beyond any possible excuse.

If you think you'd ever be able to trust him again, then by all means stay, but I'd loose all trust in my boyfriend if he did something like this without my agreement beforehand. There would be no coming back from it."

He examined it closely enough to know you were missing one. He shouldn't even be doing that.
And you think through one reddit comment you're qualified to diagnose this as a dietary issue when you don't know what food the pet was fed or what diets they tried with him? 
"You live with your mom, right?  Then I think you have 3 options here:

1) Lie to your mom about your relationship with your girlfriend until the end of college (and anything else that would upset her).  Just say you broke up.  You have 3 more years, right, so this should be doable.  Then go very low contact with your mom after college.

2) Go low contact with your mom right now.  This would likely involve you moving out, getting student loans, and your mom selling your horse.

3) Tons of drama if you do neither 1) nor 2).  This is what you're doing right now.  It's not the path I would take, but it's your choice."
"Cruises ads for sex workers, calls you names, blows up when confronted with shady behavior, screams at you, undermines your belief in your sanity, cannot communicate respectfully, etc., etc. Any one of these things is reason enough to dump him. Taken together, your breakup was overdue. 

Stay strong when he comes crawling back, promising to change. He won't. "
"I see where he is coming from, but I think he should lighten up.  He's basically saying that he doesn't trust you and never will.  I would lay it out to him like this ""Look, I enjoy going out to bars alone sometimes, and you have to trust me that I will be responsible.  I'll always let you know where I am, and you're always welcome to join me, but I am going to stop doing something I enjoy just because it gives you anxiety"""""
"It's not I can tell you that. I have made other posts about his behaviour in the past and people have said similar things on other issues I've sat him down and said enough is enough if you can't be with me and let me do things I want to do then that's it and it's helped greatly. But this..THIS. what the actual fuck?
 Not to mention his ex split from him because he was too controlling of her!
 He is not a bad person this shines a light on his major issues, I love him and have been hoping we can work through this and I can just ignore it and force him to live with my things, but fuck he is making me crazy with this."
"No, not happy. You were being taken advantage of by a man with incredibly poor judgment at best, and nefarious intentions at worst. That doesn't make me happy. I'm still not sure you realise the gravity of what happened here, which only makes you vulnerable to it again. That doesn't make me happy. I really hope you don't contact this guy again. He is bad for you. "
Acceptable would have been him setting up office hours to talk with the girl the next day. So inappropriate to interrupt the date.
"You need to come clean. What choice do you have? You cannot revoke what they will find out. It will only be worse for you in the end if you don't own up.

For the record, you didn't do anything wrong at all. I think if you explained what happened your sister will have to take accountability - you didn't leave that animal/house in a bad situation - she did. "
"I couldn't disagree with you more emphatically.  If ""he assumes she enjoyed/wanted it"" were a legal defence to rape 3/4 of all rapes would be defeated. The mindset of the rapist is ALMOST ALWAYS that the woman secretly wants it or enjoys it.

Many, many abuse victims minimise their abuse and stay with their abuser.  They blame themselves, make excuses for the abuse and assume they deserved it or should have acted differently.

People like you are a big part of the problem society has with sexual consent."
"Yeah, I think he really is and I don't know how to help him find that ""centre"". It has already been tiring, I don't know how many more of these incidents I can handle."
There are many red flags here if you are the BF.
"That's exactly what I was thinking. I wonder if he just thinks he's being cute, and has adopted this weird attribute into his personality. 

OP, stop giving him any attention when he's like this. You don't need to ghost him, just, like, don't feed into it. If he comes to you for help or reassurance, just let him know that you won't be enabling him any more, and that he needs to learn how to handle these things on his own because you won't always be there. Put the living room back how it was, if he forgets to move the dresser force him to come back to move it, don't wake up when he wants you to wake  up, and just live normally. Once he sees that he's not getting any positive reinforcement for living that way, I bet he'll change his tune. 

There isn't, like, an anime character or video game character that acts this way, is there? I'm just trying to figure out why he even thought acting like this was cute. "
"If you had 0$, no car, low SES, and no support system then you were SOL. But you were born into a great family. My advice to you is to add personal finance in your lexicon. Don't go into debt, and make your family happy. Kids are expensive. Diapers cost like $20 + formula, you are looking at least at $100 a month on baby necessities if that on top of all the doctors appointments and inevitable health visits. "
This! I am childfree but I know that for some people this is a very deeply held belief. 
"&gt; and that he checked on the Internet and the Internet said he was right

Seems that he also kind of went there knowing and looking for a fight. I mean presumably this says that even before he had casually asked if OP thought it was weird he asked for gas money, he had decided she was going to say yes and gone looking for proof to win the fight"
"Don't worry. Maybe he just wanted you to know him before having sex with him (especially if it was your first time). What he did was totally correct, and you shouldn't be worrying about it. If you end up together (like a couple), then maybe you can ask him. Don't do it so quickly, wait for the right moment to come. 
"
"Staying with him will mean that you will remain a shell of a person for the rest of your life. You know this. He doesn't need to hit you since he has manipulated the situation so efficiently as to render you incapable of leaving. Or so he thinks.

Look into women's shelters in the area. I'm not sure where you live, but certain cities and contries have helplines for various problems. They might be able to help."
"I did tell her to explain the rules to her parents. If they had a problem with that, they should have slept somewhere else. I explained to them that I needed to go to work, and the room is obviously an office as well as a guest room."
OP's wife should file for divorce. OP can you say you still love your wife with a straight face?  
"If you've ever had even mild depression that wasn't the result of an event like a death, a job loss, a breakup, etc, I STRONGLY advise against the shot and your Dr very likely will as well. It's notorious for *making* people depressed and if that's something you have already struggled with you're dealing with months of hell before it gets out of your system. I ended up in the hospital because I have Seasonal Affective Disorder, it was summer tho, and my insurance was running out so I thought I'd get the shot and that would hold me until my new insurance kicked in and I could go back on the pill.

*Oh. How. Wrong. I. Was.*

There are no words to adequately describe the depression I experienced. I felt like I wasn't in control of my actions and I was going to kill myself and not have any say in the matter."
"As a legal matter ""sperm donation"" except through a licensed facility means that the bio-dad has all the responsibilities (and rights) of any other father. That means his sister's SO could come after him for child support in the future. Or if she ever needed state assistance of any type, the state would go after him for support on its own. 

"
The self depreciation is not attractive either. I know I've had my share of not so conventionally good looking dudes because they were sure of themselves and didn't feel desperate or overly excited about my interest in them. The friendships and sexual competent just builds naturally from there. 
[deleted]
I cringed at that. So much projection.
'Why couldn't she be the other kind of mermaid with the fish on top and the lady part on the bottom!?'
Amazing update! I've been waiting for this since original post!! 
"Since getting pregnant is difficult for you and you want to have th baby you should have the baby BUT you need to be in therapy for your entire pregnancy-your relationship will be under stress and you CANNOT backslide and endanger your baby or your relationship. Weekly therapy will make sure your baby is born into the best possible circumstances.

Let G tell his family about the pregnancy-no need for you to be there too.  He can deal with the initial fallout by repeating that he understands it is a shock to them but that the two of you are very happy and would appreciate their support. If they cant give it he can tell them that one more time and then say good by and go low contact until they come around.

You have to expect them to be concerned-you have had a drinking problem and tried to kill yourself just over a year ago.  If they weren't concerned that wouldn't be normal."
My SO's parents got married within 3 months of knowing each other and are still together after 40-something years. He knows they are not the norm and had NO expectations for us to do the same. He didn't need me to explain this to him either. Your bf has absolutely no excuse!
"He was the first to say it would be ""forever"", as justification for the extra hassle and us going over budget. 


I'm pretty curious as to his coworker's wife's take but I'd be a little worried that because she's talented and never raised children she might share my husband's optimistic view of diys."
"Expectations here are really off. Painting a room or building some new furniture, ok. A new deck? That is something that is best left to professionals, full stop. You're well within your rights to say no to this stuff. Would he expect the preschool teachers to be installing the new cubbyholes at the school? I think not. "
"And they set good examples for their children by taking responsibility for their mistakes, contributing around the house, and trying to better themselves and their families. This guy just sucks."
"Maybe there's a middle ground between totally breaking up right now vs. doing nothing to make good on your ultimatum.  Do you have somewhere you could stay for a few nights, like a parent or close friend nearby?  If you left for even just one night, it might give her the wake-up call she needs that you take this very, very seriously and are actually contemplating a break."
"There isn't any answer to this that doesn't involve conversation.   Well, no, there is one -- you ignore his affair while you keep being his co-parent/roommate.  Women throughout history have accepted such arrangements, and I'm not saying that's a good thing but it does have its upside (keeps things stable for the kids, gives you some time to figure out what your post-parenting life looks like).  


Otherwise, you have to talk to him.  You can throw him out.  Or you can say, ""I know you're having an affair and I understand why, so let's just get divorced, no fighting.""  Or you can tell him you want to improve the marriage and see what he does with that.  


You might want to get some counseling of your own.  You also might want to consider whether you have really lost interest in sex, or just lost interest in him.  I thought for a few years that I had become a-sexual, but it turned out I was really just angry with my husband.  "
"Nope, nope, and nope. On a good day with a baby or a small kid at home, you can squeeze a couple hours in during naptime, but unless you're going to crate train them, you can't simultaneously work a full-time job from home and watch a kid. 

Eight hours minus whatever time it takes to tend the baby is not equal to a full workday. It's just math, dammit. "
"I mean, she said that he tried to talk to her about it but she just said she didn't want to have sex and didn't discuss it further because she was afraid of it ending the relationship... so..."
"When was the last time you had two days off completely with no ""work emergencies""? Two days completely to yourself where you could just do whatever and put off your responsibilities? If you're on call 24/7 every week, he has no fucking grounds to say his weekend off is more important than yours."
"- respects that people have a choice
- chooses not too
- doesn't force that choice on others or holds it against them

OP is indeed not pro-life"
Stick by him. This is seriously traumatic and I don't know how I would handle it. Hopefully his family is sticking by him constantly. This is very tough to get through and is one of my worst fears.
"This is an awful situation and honestly one of my worst fears. I realize this is drastic, but could he move? I think I would move and start fresh. It would be really hard, but it sounds like his life is in shambles and he needs to start somewhere where the community isn't trying to punish him. "
"See if you can get him to deactivate his Facebook and remove the app for a certain period of time. It may be a temporary bandaid to a bigger problem, but if you can give him some relief... "
Came here to say exactly the same!
"Nah, most men don't jack off to fb pics of their GFs friends and family lol. Creeps do that. He's a creep. Posts like this make me want to deactivate fb, ugh."
"Oh god, breathing the hot air of someone else's breath is a fucking nightmare. If my husband happens to turn to face me in bed while we're sleeping, it wakes me up and I have to turn over to avoid it. "
"I do think it is sexism... they believe they are superior to women because ""women's value is in their youth and looks"", whereas ""men's value increases with age"". And you are disproving that and they need to tear you down to feel better about themselves.  I think they feel inferior."

"Your puppy requires socialization with other dogs, preferably other puppies at this stage. An intro puppy class is a very good, and actually rather inexpensive way, to access that.

The trainer is not a third person involved in the argument, if *you* stop arguing, and you both agree to follow the trainer's plan. The trainer becomes the authority and you and your wife become partners again in the pups care. Right now, your wife isn't happy with you insisting that you are the ultimate authority in the dog's care, and micromanaging her every interaction. That's not surprising. No one would like that. 

As much as your wife's reactions sound childish and immature, your answers here are equally problematic. You need to let go a bit, while still making sure the pup gets the basics. A class is a very good way to approach that, and to help you and your wife get on to the same page.

It sounds like you can't be bothered to invest a bit of cash into making sure everyone in the household is comfortable with the pups training. That's not okay. If you don't know how to explain it in a way she'll understand, pay someone with much more experienced to try."
"they're pro life because that is literally their entire argument, a fetus is life thus you're a murderer.

and they try to take away the choice of others by shaming, law or otherwise."
"Still unreasonable IMO, I'm sorry. "
"Also, even if it is hormones that's causing her to react a little differently than she would, that doesn't mean what she's feeling is wrong or that you can write it off. "
"1. I asked for advice specifically *because* no one, including me, wants to dump her on the street. 

2. She has way more health problems than I've listed, and more have emerged over the years, so it's not exactly easy to remember them all."
"You'd be SHOCKED at the skeletons totally normal people have in their closet. It's down to you what to want to reveal and obviously I cant guarantee you'll never get a negative reaction to the story but a lot of people have family members they don't speak to for a huge variety of things.

 Remember, every single person in prison, every drug addict, every missing person, every run away, every prostitute had at least two parents at some point. Many will have brothers, sisters, spouses, children etc etc - that's a LOT of affected lives sadly and many of those affected people are perfectly normal, well adjusted people.

I knew a lovely, caring teacher whose son was a crack addict in prison for a string of theft and robberies.

I knew an accountant whose estranged son pulled a knife on her and, when she locked herself in the bathroom, smashed down the door and held it to her throat.

My old boss, the owner of a large company had a brother who spent his life in and out of prison. Ironically, I found that out when he 'caught' me on the phone to my brother and I made some kind of comment like ""Sorry, just my brother attracting trouble as usual. Can't choose your family, eh?"" My brothers issue was fairly minor, I was just making a half joke and he confided in me

And those are just three of the stories I know - I'm positive many others I've met have their own experiences and complications.

This sub especially is subject to a warped view of the world by its very nature, but the reality is that most people understand life is complicated and family can be difficult and won't push you too hard if you gently make it clear you have a brother you don't speak to and don't want to speak about it. Likesise, if you do speak, very few will judge you harshly."
"He doesn't initiate phone conversation much. I'm more the verbal communicator, so when I feel like talking he's always game"
"You could always get a small personal loan to get yourself certified make sure that you get it from a bank and NOT a pay day lender, those places are scams."
Um. 
Get screenshots first so you have proof they existed!
"To be honest there needs to be a flair like 'started dating in early teens'. And 'first relationship'.
People romanticise the idea of meeting someone as a kid/tween/early teen and dating all up till College and moving in together and doing all the rest.

I personally think its pretty stupid.  Its too easy for it to be just a habit.   To ne holding each other back unconsciously.  To be growing and changing at different rates to the other person.
You chose to be with someone at the age of 16, do you want to keep that decision 2, 4, 10 years later?"
"You are only 19. Not only do you have plenty of time to find a new guy, you also have time to take a break from dating and work on your own self image for a while. You've easily got another 40-50 years to go. Do you want to spend them with this guy, or guys like him?"
In my opinion he shouldn't even have the lingerie at this point if it doesn't belong to OP. No lingerie is innocent lingerie if found in your SO's belongings. Leads me to ask why he still has it. Why hasn't he thrown it out? If it's from the relationship with his ex why hasn't he returned it since they're just friends? I believe it's not old lingerie. It's from a recent encounter and he probably didn't get a chance to dispose of it before you found it OP. 
"Sounds like he is trying to shake you off gently. Don't pursue someone that you think might be avoiding you. It will slowly start to shave away at your dignity. Let it go and show up looking dynamite and enjoy the night. His loss, not yours. "
"I'm a woman and feel the same way about pregnant women, and myself when pregnant. (And I'm thankfully not 12.) Cannot explain why, but that's how I feel.

"I hope this doesn't sound too harsh, but in all honesty, based solely on what you've written here, I have absolutely no idea why you are in a relationship with this person, never mind planning to marry him.

Marriage is about PARTNERSHIP, not ordering each other around.  You need to set some clear boundaries with him regarding upkeep of the household and chores, and he needs to take some serious steps to change his attitude and the way he speaks to his FUTURE WIFE.  I see that you'll be doing couples counseling soon, and I honestly don't think that can happen quickly enough.  Just make sure you don't back down from him when you confront him about his attitude."
Yeah let's give him a freakin' medal because he forgot about his fiancee but then suddenly remembered her later. 
"You're probably be downvoted for saying ""if he were a good man he'd do X."" You don't have enough information to glean that he isn't a good man."

It could be that there's an agreement between her and her brother *not* to bring unexpected guests over - it sounds like he has some issues that might make social interaction difficult for him - but we don't know whether or not that's the case unless OP has explained more in the comments about that.
"Do not do this. If you throw stuff away it will only reinforce all his fears and anxiety and other issues. He'll just keep hoarding only be even more clingy and possessive about his stuff. Watch that hoarders show (skip the animal ones because they're just too sad).

The underlying mental problems need to be addressed before the stuff. "
"Yeah, Mike doesn't want to marry OP! My ex's father promised to buy us a house, they even zeroed in on one and then without even discussing it with me, the ex turns down the house and even the cash equivalent to *try* getting into management school. He didn't get in, didn't even bother trying to. Took me a while to recognize but he never wanted to get married and was incredibly selfish. I wasted 5 years, OP shouldn't waste a moment longer."

"Yup. All *sorts* of depressing futures are possible - sure, a currently loving partner may eventually divorce their spouse for someone younger, or they may grow apart, or one of them may die suddenly, or, or, or... 

Nonetheless, you can't live your life in constant fear of all the bad shit that might happen - particularly when there's nothing to suggest it's at all likely to happen. Sure, a certain percentage of marriages end in divorce,  but 100% of lives end in death and we generally don't accept that as a reason to lock ourselves inside and never try to experience anything good.

This might be either helpful or incredibly depressing to the OP, I just realized..."

"A girlfriend doesnt have to ""want to come home"" every single night.

If this is a common occurance you have a point. If it was once i think you're over reacting. She messed up and admitted so. You need to either let go or move on from the relationship. They'll likely mess up at some other point(because no one's perfect) and you seem like you cant handle that"
"I honestly do not agree with you at all, but now you have clearly stated what it is you seek in a relationship. Personal preference etc. And if she isn't it, you should move on. "

I think the reason why I posted was the very last bit about him not being involved with wedding planning at all... it was the first time I really started to have a little self doubt and wanted to see if it was an issue.  And, maybe there's some underlying issue that I haven't addressed.

"tl;dr - Had something similar happen to me, I think it's perfectly reasonable to believe your girlfriend.

Hey, OP. Late to comment, but I hope this might help you a bit.

I [30F] have been in this situation, surprisingly more than once. I'm an Asian girl who lives in a small Midwest town. I used to work in the food industry - fast food, serving, cooking, some bartending, you name it. And what you said about hard rejection not being good for business is very true. I'm what most people consider attractive - I've been asked to do and have done modeling several times, and since I'm an ""exotic"" looking minority in a very white town, I get a lot of attention from guys. 99% of it is unwanted, but when you work in a tip-based job you don't go around giving every guy who hits on you the cold shoulder. Most guys understand that you are just doing your job. They'll come in and flirt with you, and they'll tip really well, and you might even become a weird quasi sort of friend with them... which makes sense when you figure that if they're regulars you're probably seeing them once or twice a week. Servers and bartenders have to make a lot of small talk, and when you have repeat customers sometimes that small talk naturally evolves into something more personal. And so many guys realize that *this is just your job*. They enjoy your company and will come to your workplace on days they know you're working just to see you, but in reality they know that you are just doing your job and there is definitely nothing more than a professional or sometimes friendly relationship happening.

That said, servers and bartenders are also human. Sometimes we fuck up, and we make bad judgement calls. Sometimes one of our nice, ""normal"" regulars turns out to be a really big creep, and sometimes we don't realize it right away. 

I used to work at a restaurant that was also a really popular sports bar. It was actually a ski hill, but with a hotel/bar/fancy restaurant. I was a cook at the time, so I didn't have to deal with customers all the time, but we had an open kitchen so a lot of the regulars would stop by to chat on their way into the dining room/bar. We also had a really good staff working there at the time, and we would all congregate at the bar after our shifts to drink a few pints and unwind. So it wasn't uncommon for us to end up hanging out with the regulars on any given night of the week. Some of them even became friends. 

Anyways, there was this one guy who would show up every night around the time I would get off of work. He'd be sitting at the bar by the time I got done, and since he was a regular all my coworkers knew him and he would end up involved in conversations I was in. Since I was a cook and not a server I didn't feel the need to kiss customers' asses, but since he was a regular and I took pride in my workplace, I felt like I should at least be nice to him. We talked a few times and he expressed his interest in me, to which I politely replied, ""I'm flattered, but I'm seeing someone,"" because I was. In normal situations, that would be that, but this guy... oh, man.

So around that time I had this modeling gig for a yearly calendar that a local ski shop puts out. It wasn't a very big deal, but since the place I worked at was a ski hill, a lot of the people I worked with and a lot of our customers knew about the calendar and kind of used it as a, ""Oh look at our little celebrity,"" thing to poke fun at me and watch me squirm with embarrassment. All in good fun, really. Except this guy ends up with a copy of it, and ends up cutting out one of my pictures from it and carrying it around in his wallet so he could tell everyone that I was his girlfriend. He didn't do this at my workplace, because everyone there, including aaaall of the other regulars, knew I had turned him down. But he went around to other bars and places in town spewing this nonsense, and since we live in a very small place it didn't take long for word to get around. 

The guy I was seeing at the time was really insecure and super threatened by any guy that showed me attention. It was actually a pretty volatile relationship, but I deeply cared for him, so I always did my best (explaining, giving him full access to my phone and Facebook, eventually pleading) to convince him that some guys literally can't take no for an answer. 

So this guy goes around spreading these elaborate stories about how he's dating me and we're going on vacation together, etc, etc. And the guy I was seeing at the time at first believed me when I said it was all BS, but after a certain amount of persistence from the weird guy he said, ""No one would go through the hassle of making up such an elaborate tale if there wasn't truth to it,"" and left me. (He later came back, but that's besides the point.)

Anyways. I'm terrible at confrontation, so I never said anything to this guy. I just avoided the fuck out of him... until one day I go to work and my boss tells me that my ""stalker"" had been arrested. For breaking and entering. Into his ex-wife's property. And assaulting her. Which... pretty much made me sooooo incredibly thankful that things hadn't gotten worse than a few elaborate lies.

Sorry for the wall of text, OP, but I guess I just wanted to let you know that these things *do* happen, and I personally am inclined to believe your girlfriend. You might feel like she wasn't entirely truthful about how she hung out with this dude while you guys were on a break... but maybe she's feeling a bit guilty about hanging out with him because she feels like she somehow ""encouraged"" his craziness. Attractive women go through all kinds of weirdness where they sometimes feel like it's their own fault when they attract crazies because they were nice, or wanted to be friends, or didn't scream, ""GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME,"" when the guy made an advance. A lot of attractive women are often painfully aware of how often they're perceived to ""lead men on"" just by simply existing, or doing their job. Thank you for standing by your girlfriend, I hope you two have a great future. "
"Yes, she could go in to the station and ask to speak to an officer. She could explain the situation, say she fears for her safety and ask if there's anything that can be done.

"&gt; Do kids usually go through a cruel phase?

Yes. Kids are horrible little shits with no sense of empathy. Until, shocker, about age 11 or 12. You are completely developmentally normal.

&gt;She is cautious about people....I think what I did traumatized her.

It probably has very, very little to do with you.

My sister and I were very close in age and we did horrible shit to each other and fought (physically fought) at about that era in our childhood. Today, we are super close. I remember all of the horrible shitty things I did to her but I forget most of what she did to me (except for the Wall Writing Incident). She remembers the horrible things she did to me but mostly forgets what I did to her (except for the Spider Web Incident).

"Are there states where a parent is forced to have visitation with their child? I don't think so. Having both biological parents involved is not viewed as a child's right. It's viewed as a parental right, when one parent is trying to keep the other parent from seeing a child they want to see.

You can say it *should* be a child's right, if you want. But legally it isn't. 

And though child support technically is considered something a child has a right to, I don't think the state will enforce that if the parent who has custody doesn't request or need it. "
"&gt;It makes me insecure as hell 

I think the problem is that you're *already* insecure. You're assuming that the lack of a reply signifies something that's wrong with you instead of something about the other person: maybe they're busy, maybe they had a rough week and didn't feel like chatting, maybe they're awkward and shy themselves, maybe they're just a bit of a shitty and inconsiderate person. Maybe they just didn't feel any chemistry, which is a bummer but again doesn't mean you did something wrong - it's just straight-up impossible to be so smooth and attractive that every single woman on the planet wants you.

Best you can do is try to distract yourself if you're feeling insecure. Don't dwell on it, go and do something else instead. Easier said than done sometimes, I know, but you have to make an effort if you don't want to end up obsessing over not being texted back."

"I can't say whether this is what's responsible or not, but since you've asked about the ""culturally sensitive"" angle, it's actually possible that this is a difference in cultures rather than a medical issue. 

I'm not saying that **all** people from China do this by any means, but as a very, very general statement, throat-clearing isn't considered rude or ""gross"" in Chinese culture the same way that it is in western cultures. I'm completely speculating with this second point because I haven't exactly grown up immersed in Chinese culture, but it seems to me that this becomes a habitual or unconscious behaviour for some people, rather than something that's only done when sick or congested. 

I'm saying this mainly because from what you're describing, I don't know that getting him some cough drops or something would actually address the issue in the workplace. I'd honestly recommend having at least a discussion with an HR rep either way, since either offering medical advice or trying to tell someone that their habit is unacceptable in your culture can be *really* dicey.

"I totally agree with this! While I think it's shady that the wife lied about it, I can also see that there are reasons why someone would want to cover up this kind of past. For starters, OP has admitted he would have judged her for this and likely not even married her, and also the cousin saying she was dating one of the strip club owners....it's possible that there were some dark things going on with her/that time/those events and it's painful or shameful for her to talk about it.

You haven't provided much background, so only you can know whether this is part of a pattern of rude thoughtless behaviour, and only you can decide whether she did it deliberately to hurt you.

"This is the unfortunate truth.  Based on OP's personality as displayed in this thread, I would not date this guy no matter what he looked like.  

I'm sorry, OP, I realize that's a rude thing for me to say, but I'm trying to get across to you that you can absolutely fix this problem if you can change those things that make people conclude you have an off-putting personality.  

Even if your personality is great, your behavior and manner of expression makes people perceive your personality as unpleasant.  

Even if you truly don't fit the average definition of a physically attractive guy, you could be doing better in the dating game if your personality came off more attractive.  Lots and lots of men who are not classically attractive have sex.

Even if you currently look like an Adonis, you can tell from the responses you're getting here, many of which are probably from women, that something you're putting out there is coming off poorly."

I dont have to tell her no because she knows that's not something a married woman should do for many reasons.  Same reason I wouldnt spend the night at some other womans house.  Yes, she's likely sleeping with him but just as importantly she's walking all over you and completely disrespecting you, her husband.  "

From previous comments, it sounds like you are going out every weekend. Pregnancy makes a woman feel vulnerable, maybe you should take to her about why she feels this way. She might have some valid points. "
"Not a woman, but have you considered having a casual conversation (or one during or after sex) about kinks and fetishes? Maybe make a list of things the both of you wanna try and see if you can put pegging on there?

"Just curious would be to ask for a taste. That is what I did from age 6 to 11. If I saw someone drinking something I as not familiar with I would ask for a taste.

He needs to stop putting the onus on interaction on you and take it up with her if he has an issue.Also, beyond her unpleasant attitude, what exactly does your brother think you'll have in common with her? You getting along with Jazz makes sense because of your ages but Bianca is an adult woman who I doubt has much in common with a teenage boy."

"Your wife sounds like she needs serious therapy. I wish you luck and hope your wife can stop being batshit insane and get help. As for Heather, you might give a quick apology and just let her know it's not her fault, you know she has nothing to do with it  and it's fully an issue with your wife and Kate. Your wife and Kate have caused her to quit her team and that's unforgivable; Heather doesn't deserve that.

Hopefully Heather's actions are more of a ""Jesus christ this shit is ridiculous, I'm out"" rather than ""I feel I impact a coworker"" but nonetheless that poor woman is changing her career moves because of the hostility and toxicity your wife caused. Being that your wife has nothing to do with your workplace, this is absolutely nuts.

Best of luck and hope things can be peacefully and healthily resolved in time.

Edit: also why are you not reporting Kate to HR immediately? Her behavior NEEDS to be documented and addressed. She's not fit for your workplace and helped cause another woman to leave over bogus charges. Report her."

"&gt;I have brought this up on occasion in the past, and he knows it bothers me. He is dismissive, and tells me I am being petty and shallow. He says jeans and chinos are uncomfortable, and noone cares what he wears.

That's really not okay.

My husband used to wear track pants all the time, too. Like, everywhere. I finally asked him if he could put forth a bit more effort because I don't really find track pants to be very attractive. He apologized and went and bought some more clothes and now the track pants only come out occasionally.

*That's* the sort of response you should get from someone when they respect you and you make a reasonable request. "

"HIV is extremely rare. Even if you were both having unprotected sex with multiple partners, you have a very low chance of getting it. It was immature and needy to ask her about what she was doing AFTER you broke up. Don't text her anymore and move on. If she wants you around, she will text you. "
"Just take a deep breath. You're going to be OK.

It sucks to find out this way, but now that you know, you can start processing it. You can use this time to think about what you want and need to know from them. Write it down.

It sounds like your family loves you very much. Keep that in mind today as you're waiting for them to come home. They love you."
"That sounds pretty abusive honestly.

I don't have advice besides trying to branch out away from your ""family"". Sometimes the best family we have is the one we build for ourselves from the friends, mentors, and community who actually care for us. You've done nothing wrong, and you are blamed for your own existance. 

Things will get better in a few years when you can leave for good, until then I would say try building relationships outside of the house and maybe talk to a school counselor about your home life. "
"Sit him down for a conversation. Tell him that while you appreciate how apologetic he is, at this point it's crossed the line, because he's making it about him and his feelings rather than you and yours.

"10 can feel long, if she's drying up after she cums.  you may need to add lube so she doesn't get uncomfortable.   Mine would go for over an hour... Often more.  So I feel like she'd being pretty selfish not giving you 10 minutes to finish up"
3 months isn't a lot of time to be asking someone to alienate their family or to make assumptions about their relationship.
"&gt;  I doubt that she's trying to punish you, she probably doesn't feel comfortable with physically touching you. 

Absolutely agree, when I am watching tv with my fianc√©e its not like giving a shoulder or scalp rub is a calculated decision.  The idea just pops into my head and I do it.  She is likely in a place where that idea just isn't coming up.  Not that that is her fault at all, she isnt in the place right now.  Flowers, kind words will help.  Pushing will not though I expect small, slow edging towards normalcy may help him.  

The difference between pushing and 'edging' in mind is big.  Pushing is to ask for a back rub or a cuddle.  Moving towards normalcy is to ask if she wants to watch tv together.  If yes, the next day while on the couch raise your arm up 'asking wordlessly' if she wants to cuddle up to you some.  Of course taking a no in stride."
"Yeah. I'd say he's open to being with you in some way/ not as straight as he thinks. I thought I was straight until my first girlfriend.

By the way, a discussion about having children needs to happen face to face."

Ok, those two responses make me think it's either period/yeast infection/UTI type stuff, or something to do with another partner and she's trying to be polite and keep a ""don't ask don't tell"" policy. 

Maybe just ask her if it's health/body related, or other partner related. If it's neither, ask her why she's hesitant to share. You guys need to have a verbalized agreement about how much information you want shared about other partners and such. This discussion should happen over coffee or when you're just hanging out, not when you're doing sexy stuff or imminently on the way to it."
"If she's ace, it'll help you to think about it as the same kind of situation it'd be if you had feelings for a lesbian friend. You are not a sexual option for her.

3.  I don't mean to sound rude, but what exactly do you want from reddit? No one here can waive a wand to make your BF act like a man and not a child. No one can make you take a firm stand and insist that he be responsible for his own actions. If he makes a mess, he cleans it up and cleans it up properly right away. If he breaks something, he pays to replace it immediately. 



If you aren't willing to do any of the above, I guess you could replace all of your furniture with plastic outdoor-type furniture, and cover your counter tops and carpet with tarps. "

"Usually jump on people who are vulnerable, financially not stable, weary of reality, and just take them and put a big fat swastika in front of them and say 'Hey, I got the reason and solution for every single thing that's wrong in your life!'

"Joe, as a woman, you are being a complete wanker. I really tried to empathise with you here- I really tried to understand your perspective, but I just can't. I am devastated for Jen, this is a huge misunderstanding. For a lot of women, marriage is part of their life plan. They romanticise the idea, they assume their natural life course is to find a loving partner, settle down, marry, raise a family. For some women that is ALL they want- there is absolutely nothing wrong with being family orientated. Yes, there are lots of women who feel differently (including myself), but for a lot of people marriage and raising a family are an accomplishment, one of the proudest and most incredible things they could ever do. Imagine your top 5 aspirations in life, imagine getting part way to completing one of those aspirations, and having somebody tell you it's never going to happen and they don't want it to happen or marry you anyway. devastating, right? 
Further, you guys are not young. She does have a very real biological clock which you just don't have. Imagine having a timeline for something you have always, ALWAYS wanted, it's scary. Very scary. She isn't being ridiculous, it's at a stage now where she doesn't really have the time freedom to find someone else, build the relationship, marry, have babies. YOU have that freedom, but she doesn't, purely because of her biology of being a woman. That's why she probably feels she has wasted her time on you- her time is precious and running out. The years she spent investing in you with the goal of calling you a life partner, a husband, a father to her children have been wasted and she could have spent those years investing in another man who wanted those same things. THATS why it's so important to communicate early on- she will be severely compromising so much she wants from her life to make you happy if she stays with you. And she is now in the awful position where she can't get that time back.
That being said, Jen is not without fault. How she handled your coming out was not ok, but you didn't time it well or handle the situation appropriately at all. If you want this relationship to continue I think you need a good hard lesson in compromise and understanding. "
"I'd keep it vague and non-committal. People generally don't pry too much about that, unless they sense an interesting back story. 

You could try something like ""Oh they live out in (place) and I don't see them often. They're doing fine though, last I heard."" If pushed you could mention where they work, where they went to school, and other minutia. If they push you about *why* your don't see them now often, you're not obliged to bare your private life to strangers and work acquaintances. Something general like ""You know how it is,"" with a shrug or ""everyone is so busy these days"" or ""I do my best,"" then ask about their families.

The one time family tends to come up is around the holidays, but again I'd keep it vague and sick to general statements."
"No YOU need to make arrangements.  
Her stuff is no longer of any concern to you, leave it, not your concern.  
Also do not back down on the work. This guy sounds like the type that would LOVE to have you look bad so that he gets any job offers or positive reviews.   
Just remember he may have played, but she made all these choices, don't bother having any pity toward her.  
Embrace the indifference, do not hate on them, it will only show them you still care, still giving them power over you.  
Your indifference will hurt her FAR more than anything else you could do.

"There's a lot going on here. I don't feel qualified to answer the question about your stepdad, it really depends on how you strongly you want to maintain a relationship with your mom. Since your mom doesn't seem to be a very positive force in your life, more distance from both of them could be good. You might not have to formally cut them out though. 

Regarding your boyfriend, I don't really think you were taken advantage of. You offered to help him out, he got back on his feet, and now he's paying his share. That's the best way that taking in an unemployed partner can possibly turn out. Do you think he would do the same for you if the situation was reversed? The airport thing is odd to me. I'm wondering if you're really bothered that he didn't get you a keychain, or if you're just looking for an excuse to break up because things are getting really serious. It sounds like you're getting freaked out by moving in together and you are looking for a way out. I think you have to really think over how you're feeling, talk to your boyfriend about how you feel about living together and any concerns you have about living with another person and making this commitment. Tell him that you are worried that you can't be as supportive as he needs you to be because you're emotionally burnt out. He sounds like a good guy but that doesn't mean you have to stay together if you aren't happy. It sounds like you need to figure out what you want. I really wish you the best with that. "
"I'm from England and that is not acceptable at all. Fair enough not tipping (because our staff get a minimum wage so tips aren't necessary) but most people I know who don't tip aren't proud of it, they just don't think to do it.

"&gt;So I've know ""Sandra"" for several years now, instant attraction. I hit it off so well with her it's not even funny. I have zero doubt that she's the one for me. I've made it clear that I would wade through hell for her and wait forever if I had to. So far the timing has just not worked out for us to be together however but I still hang out with her as friends once a week or so.

Translation: I have been pining for a woman who is not at all romantically attracted to me for years. She has repeatedly told me she does not want to date me and is not interested in me, but I am too manly to be affected by the clue-by-four across the head. 

&gt;But then one of the guys said something like ""I can't get you drunk if I don't buy you the first drink."" 

OK, a little cheesy, but it's not like ""Baby, I want to turn you upside down, fill you full of beer, and drink you until you're empty""...

&gt;Sandra sort of blew it off but it really pissed me off 

Because you really wanted him to hit on you? 

Because Sandra is actually a deaf-mute, unable to clearly communicate with other human beings? 

Because Sandra was actually a cardboard cut-out that you had brought to the bar? 

&gt;so I said ""not tonight and not around the lady, understand?"" 

Because Sandra asked for you to intervene? No?

Because Sandra is such a weak flower, she can't speak up for herself?

Because Sandra has no experience dealing with aggressive men in bars?

Because Sandra has no clue how to handle a man talking to her in public?

&gt;Then another guy said to Santa ""ditch the dork"" and another chimed in ""she looks like my future ex-wife"" and another came over and blatently asked for her number even though I was sitting there.

How *dare* that man ask your single, unattached friend for her phone number while **you**, her friend-that-isn't-dating-her is right there! It's like he doesn't have any respect for the long-standing traditions of dorks everywhere pretending to be friends with women in the hopes that they'll someday get laid as a result!

&gt;when I got back I could see Sandra entering a phone number from the guy who had not yet said smart ass shit. This really pissed me off and I demanded that we get out of there. 

How *dare* that woman accept a phone number from someone other than you, her long-suffering platonic-friend-who-is-pining-with-unrequited-affection! It's like she has no respect for the long-standing traditions of dorks everywhere pretending to be friends with women in the hopes that they'll someday get laid as a result!

&gt;She said this guy had apologized for the actions of his friends and it was all cool now. 

Wow. It sounds like your friend handled that extremely well, defusing a situation and getting an apology. And it sounds like the guy was being thoughtful. Win-win, right?

&gt;I said it want cool and they had disrespected her and me and it was time to go. The guy stood up to say he was sorry for his drunk friends and offered to buy me a drink 

Oh wow. So he apologized for disrespecting her, and for disrespecting you! That's really nice and thoughtful of him. Naturally, you reacted with the grace and maturity by...

&gt;and I just lost it and cold cocked him and knocked him to the floor. 

What is life like on the Earth you come from? On the Earth I live in, when someone says ""I'm sorry for what my friend said, would you like a beer?"" we say something like ""Thank you. That's what I wanted to hear. I appreciate your offer"" and walk away happy. On Bizarro-Earth, the phrase ""I'm sorry"" must be something like slapping someone with a dueling glove. I do not want to visit your Earth. Please do not visit mine.

&gt;the cops were pretty much waiting for me as if I started the problems. 

Well, yes. Because you did. You interrupted a conversation that didn't include you, made a threat, told the bouncer you were looking for trouble, refused to accept an apology, and *started the fight*. There is no version of this story where you did not initiate trouble, and seek to escalate it at every step.

&gt;I had expected that Sandra would bail me out 

Why? She's the one who got the guys to apologize, and you're the guy who sucker-punched a dude trying to buy you a beer. 

&gt;I told her that I had not started this 

Except that you did start it. And she was right there when it happened. So yeah, that lie is going to go over like a wet fart in church.

&gt;and said that if she chose to hang out with that guy I couldn't be friends with her--which was a total bluff but she called me on it and hung up on me.

Recapping here: you interrupted a conversation you weren't a part of, threaten a guy, call the bouncer, refuse a free drink and an apology, throw a punch, get beat up, question your friend about what she did afterwards like a jealous boyfriend, and then try to dictate who she can and can't be friends with. Did I miss anything?

&gt;I sat down and wrote her a huge Facebook message

Then you deleted the whole thing, because you realized how incredibly selfish it was, and how you just needed to get those ideas out of your head. Right? 

&gt;she was my soulmate and how sorry I was and how great I would be for her and her son and that we've known each other for so long and it can't end when we are so obviously meant to be together. 

Relationships aren't court cases; you can't lawyer your way into a date or a relationship. They aren't like used cars, either; you can't ""sell"" someone a relationship. (""This is a great deal! Really good for you &amp; your kid! What do I have to do to put you in a relationship today?"")

Just because you want her doesn't mean she wants you. And if she doesn't want you, then you obviously *aren't* meant to be together.

&gt;I also said it's not fair that she chooses a guy who started shit with me and that I was defending her.

In the action-movie version of this scene, **you're the bad guy**. You're the guy who tells people not to talk to his girl. You're the guy who won't accept apologies, who grabs the girl by the arm and says ""it's time to go baby"". Seriously, in every 80's action movie ever, **you're the bad guy** in the bar scene. 

&gt;She responded way to fast to have actually read it ""lot to digest, give me space."" I responded with ""what does that mean?""

""Give me space""

""explain that statement in detail, to my satisfaction!""

&gt;I have texted her quite a few times (not obsesively) offering to take her to coffee, to babysit Sebastian, etc... 

I'm sorry, I got that last bit wrong.

""Give me space""

""explain that statement in detail, to my satisfaction!""

""...""

""Why have you not given me the explanation I demand?""

""...""

""You have failed to explain what this 'space' is that you need from me or how I am supposed to give it. Please reply at once!""

""...""

""How can I comply with your hopelessly vague and unclear request for 'space' if you fail to clarify to my satisfaction?""

""...""

""Also, I would like to resume all of our prior interactions, including you trusting me with your child, as though my inappropriate and violent behavior had never happened.""

&gt;My heart is literally being ripped from my chest because I just reacted to the situation that was put in front of me, I didn't start this.

You did start this, it is entirely your fault, and you have been deeply dishonest about your intentions towards your ""friend"" for years and now that's all coming home to roost. You should feel bad, but not for reasons you are feeling bad. 

&gt;What do I say to her to get her back? To convince her that I'm the guy for her? That this is all just a speed bump in an otherwise great relationship?

Wow. Another glimpse into Bizarro-world, where 'happy' means 'sad', ""I'm sorry"" means ""let's fight"", and where 'never had a single date in years' means a 'great relationship'. It's a world gone mad, where men think they get women 'back' that were never theirs in their first place, where other people's preferences aren't things to be respected, but arguments to be defeated. Again, please find whatever space-time portal you used to come to my planet, and return to your own.

"Why all this bitterness and anger at your sister?  What did she ever do to you to make you have such a visceral reaction to going to a god damn baby shower?

How is it your sister's fault that you didn't have your own shower or your own friends?  It would be one thing if your mom was throwing the shower, because there I can see a reason for legitimate jealously, but her friend is doing it.

Your lack of friends is no ones fault but your own.  Make friends with your daughter's friends' parents.  Make friends with people at work.  Join a club, gym, church, book club, whatever.

"Your local state / county should have a Department of Health &amp; Human Services, which should have a subdivision for mental health issues. Start talking with them about Mike, about what kind of options they have for treatment. The word you may want to use is 'crisis', as in ""I think Mike is having a crisis; he's threatening to kill himself and he's damaging things"". 

Other options depend on the terms of your lease/rental agreement; your mother signed the lease, but did Mike sign as well? He's an adult, not a child-dependent, so him staying there long-term could be a violation of the rental agreement. If your mother wanted him out but didn't want to be the one to force him out, she could talk to the landlord. Most landlords don't want violent, destructive tenants, especially ones who aren't on the lease and thus aren't legally liable for the damage they cause.

"I think you should talk to your brother about his son's punishment.  I think you should have some input about it, and I think there are three things you should demand and get as part of Bradley's punishment:

* You should get the full truth.  Was this the first time this happened or were there other times?  Do your kids know what he was doing up there?  Did your kids ask questions?  

* You should get a really complete written apology from Bradley.  He should acknowledge the disrespect he showed you and your house, the disrespect he showed towards your son by using his room for sex, and the danger he put your kids in by doing this while babysitting.

* Bradley should return the money you paid him for this week and for every time he had his girlfriend over.  

Right now I think you, and your SIL and her family, are focused way too much on the ultimate outcome and not on what happens next.  This happened *yesterday*.  I think it's much too soon for you to forgive their son - he hasn't even apologized properly yet for crying out loud, and way too soon for anyone to tell you you're wrong for not letting this go.  But I also think it's too soon for you to decide that this is unforgivable.  It wouldn't hurt for someone to tell your SIL's family to back off and give it time, and it also wouldn't hurt for you to acknowledge that your real position is that the relationship between your family and Bradley is *in danger of* being permanently broken, not that it absolutely has been."
"In case your instructor tries to act like you're being a triggered special snowflake, keep these points in mind: 

-- When you seek jobs or start your own business, you have full control over which industries you would be willing to enter or not. 

-- If this instructor or a student takes pictures of you making the presentation, it could hurt your chances of getting a real job. 

In your defense, you could interview several sex industry professionals and ask them how they dress for their presentations. Then present your results to your instructor and the department head. "
"Right now it doesn't sound like you're in a very healthy situation. 

She's having sex that she doesn't enjoy so she can have children, your sexual needs aren't being met, I'd imagine that both of you feel a little frustrated and all of this is going to put a strain on your relationship. 

I'm sorry but I really don't see how staying together is a good option for any of you."
"I'll probably use that line, word for word, if she doesn't calm down.

I've asked her to get rid of the cable, and she said it's a pain in the ass to do it. So if she gives me grief, I'll take it upon myself to change the plan. "
"Lol when someone has to resort to calling people names, you know they have no real argument."
She's not taking me to court. But I looked at the picture again. If you zoom into the bottle you can read the word alcohol free on it. 
"If he is the executor of the will, he doesn't get the option of not dealing with you. If he is not, you're dealing with the wrong person. Sounds like the relationship isn't the issue at this point at it's more of a legal issue. Sounds like you may need an estate attorney, but to start you need to see the will and speak with the executor, if that's not your father."
"Honestly it sounds like he stoked these insecurities himself with his comments about ""preppy blondes"".

Anyway, on your part, make sure you dont follow her social media or look at her profile or whatever.  Ultimately if you cant get over this insecurity it will end your relationship...but maybe that would be for the best?"
"They will do it whether OP is there or not.  It's not in her job description.  Further, a 19 year old can make a wonderful nanny but counselor and moral police?  Way beyond her emotional pay grade.  

If they fix their relationship it won't be because a 19 year old nanny took matters into her own hands.  Friend?  Family member?  Therapist?  Maybe.  College student nanny?  Nah.  They're the adults.  It's their family, their kids, their relationship.  They haven't hired her to keep them emotionally just, it's not even her major.  She can't/shouldn't have to field this one."
"Well, replace Pokemon fishing or something. If you didn't fish, it would be a little weird to go out with her and her fishing buddies and just sit in the boat awkwardly for seven hours unable to join the conversation because it's about the peculiarities of trout and bass and tying flies and stuff, and your knowledge level is more like ""bluegill, that's a fish, right?"".

Honestly, from what you describe I think the ""guy"" aspect doesn't really sound concerning, she is legitimately a serious Pokemon player. What is concerning is how obsessed she's got with the game spending every waking moment with it. She needs to start compromising and make more time for you.

She's probably not excited about going out for drinks with them, not because of sketchy reasons, but because she doesn't really want to hang out with them socially and really just wants to be playing more Pokemon.

Maybe if you do go out as a group, pick restaurant or bar that's also a Pokemon gym or something."
Why *was* he going to the bathroom? That's what I thought too. 
"Those people can fuck right off. My mom had me when she was 35 in 1992 and my sister at 38 in 1995 and we're both normal (you know, medically speaking).  You do you!"

"I was having a rough day with my abusive (then-)boyfriend. I was curled up at the bus stop with my head in my hands.

A car drove by, stopped, turned around, and came back. The driver rolled down his window and called out to me to ask if I was okay or needed anything. 

His interaction with me took about 10 seconds, but it stayed with me for a week afterwards. It was heartbreakingly relieving to know that a stranger cared enough to turn around and ask if I was okay..

I'm now in a much better place with a much better man."
"And it's bullshit, too, because the very first thing my husband does when he comes home is hunt me down so he can smooch me."
"In addition to telling her ASAP, don't get angry if it's not her thing. You can't judge what she wants but hope it goes alright "
"Because I love *them*. I want to raise my kids and I made a promise to them that I would never leave them barring from illness or death. When I adopted them, I didn't sign those paper with the belief it was going be temporary, I went into with the mindset that it will be going to be forever. Just because I'm divorcing Billy doesn't mean I will abandon them because they're not my blood or that I'm childfree. You don't do that to people you love and that includes Billy. I just won't be his wife. I'm going be a co-parent and a friend. 

I just don't want to have a baby. I don't want to be pregnant. I don't have the desire to be a mom to my own child. I don't want to halt my career life to have a baby that I don't want. I know for a fact I would have to take care of the baby, not Billy because he won't leave his career--and then I have to start all over again carrer-wise when that child goes to school? No. Also, I know I can be a caring parent since life has proved me with Vinnie and Scott that but it doesn't *guarantee* that I might love my *own* child. My biggest fear is resenting my baby and I know it can mess someone's mind and worse, his/her life. "
"Indeed.

And stop saying 'toot'."
We were right though :P
Shouldn't have read it then.
"So which one of you got laid over the weekend? Dude, not cool, don't make fun of your friend for something like this. Also, what if she straight up wasn't interested? How is that his fault?

Be a better friend, dude."
"I mean seeing how he continues to shittalk his wife, this guy is extremely narcisistic and refuses to see how he might have equal if not more fault.

If anything cheating on his wife is of equal negative value as going crazy ballistic and ruining a friendship. Both are really really bad."
"Thanks for your sound advice. I'm not so much guilting myself as I am worried that it might come out at some time in the near or distant future at the worst possible time. My wife and ex gf aren't in the same social circles but the ex does get seen around holidays due to family relations. The ex knows my wife didn't know and she said she would keep it a secret, which she really is good at, but you never know. Murphy's Law can really suck.

And part of it is a little bit guilt. We're past the affair and working on our marriage. We've been in counseling for almost a year and it's stronger than it was before and we both learned a lot and we've both been much, much more honest with each other than we ever have been. So keeping something, even something as little as this (though my wife probably wouldn't see it as something little), makes me feel a tad bit guilty.  I'm not losing sleep over it though. 

I whole heartedly agree with your point of my wife holding it against me whenever I question her loyalty if she found out. "
"Yeah I was wondering if it was because I'm a girl that he expected me to just nicely agree to everything he said. His response was that people have feelings and should be nice to each other, regardless of gender but I'm still skeptical.

And yes, I would've called John but he never gave me his number after I gave him mine and he never texted me afterwards. 

Also sometimes, he does give good advice but other times (because we are both young and have a lack of experience, I think) he gives advice that I don't agree with. "
"^ definitely don't just drop the relationship. It's fine to have reservations, you're making the next step and it's scary. Talk to him, see how he really feels, let him know your concerns. If after an actual discussion happens he still feels that way then consider ending it"
"Yeah, I was on her side until this part. Just run, dude. "
You seem like you'd be a mentally sound and reasonable parent!
"Here's the thing, though: It WAS your intention to do something she didn't want. She told you in so many words she didn't want to have sex. Then she agreed to anyway, but you still knew she ""wasn't enthusiastic about it."" "
"&gt;  I'm going to go with a slightly unconventional response and say just give it time. 

They've been together five years though, if she hasn't realised it already I don't think she will unless they have a serious talk about it."
"If you want to deny gay people equal legal rights, including marriage, then you're homophobic. You can try to argue otherwise all you want but it's not going to change anything."
"If she didn't want a child, and she didn't want to be a mother, how exactly did she miss out? Not saying suddenly changing your mind about it and trying to have a mother-daughter relationship out of nowhere is okay. I am just pointing out that she didn't objectively miss out if she didn't want it. "
"&gt; [him] having children

You seem a bit fixated on this. If you can't come around to the idea, that's fine, but it seems like you've been spinning and spinning around thinking about ""his"" kids by his (would-be) sister-in-law. You're not wrong that this is different from other kinds of nieces and nephews, but I would try to put yourself in the other couple's shoes. They're probably trying to get a kid that is as close to being a genetic mix of the two of them as possible. You can ask them why they picked your boyfriend ahead of his brothers, but when they try to have kids, they're not trying to have ""his"" kids, they're having their own. It doesn't sound like he'll be involved in rearing or supporting their children at all.

Your boyfriend is wrong about where you're coming from on this, and he's wrong to dismiss your feelings. I would suggest you get couples counseling to help you two deal with this question. I am a bit more inclined towards his perspective on the idea, but that doesn't mean he should ignore or belittle your feelings on the matter. Ultimately, you'll need to decide whether you can work to accept the possible sperm donation. It sounds easier to me to do than to give up a strong relationship."
"Making sure the people you're with are safe/have a way a home is basic. Not leaving someone behind is basic.

This is not a ""princess"" treatment. Adulthood is looking out for those around you.

Why does he keep putting you in precarious positions? It's grossly irresponsible and even dangerous."
"Please use this to realise how far your current relationship is from healthy and normal. 

Think about how the Lego situation might normally go down. Maybe both partners would build together, spend a few days on it, have fun. Maybe it'd be one person's hobby, and they'd relax by building parts of it alone. 

Then compare that to the dynamic where neither partner really wants the Lego, one person just enjoys knowing the other is forced to build it. How fucked up is that? He is outright telling you that the gift he wants most, is you toiling and suffering and doing a task you don't enjoy. That's not something anyone who cares about you would want."
Does it have anything do with her being female and everything being the fault of the female in Saudi Arabia?
"100 lbs in a year is a solid chunk of change. If she's not interested in losing it, you have a decision to make. You're young, not married and don't have kids. It's totally okay to break up with her over this. "
"If by ""hurt your feelings"" you mean ""was hypocritical as fuck and sexist to boot"", I agree!"
"I came here to mention recording it, too. Record one or more of the instances, to show the buzzer going off at night and that it is her buzzing you. Get proof that it's her in case she denies it should the landlord approach her about it."
"&gt; Part of me feels like I should get back with him, because guys aren't interested in me and I absolutely don't do well on my own. How do I fix this? 

Get a dog. 

Dogs are 1000% better than assholes who cheat on you and abuse you. What's more, dogs are excellent judges of character (provided they are raised by/living with you, so they are attached to you specifically), so if you're interested in dating someone you can bring them around your dog and see how your dog reacts to them. 

I don't know how they do it, but my dog was able to detect when any of my friends were shitty people. Something about them would set him off. He didn't bite them or anything, but he clearly avoided them, when he was normally a very friendly dog who loved attention from anyone.

If you want someone that will love you unconditionally and will protect you and won't treat you like your boyfriend is treating you, get a dog. But do some research first, to find out which breed is best for you. I would also recommend looking for teenage/adult dogs (older than one year) if it's your first time owning a dog, as puppies can be a bit of a challenge."
"If you want friendship, look for it in meetup groups, not a dating site. 

You want flattery and attention from girls now that you're more attractive. You want to flirt and see what else is out there, and to have your ego stroked. Are you okay with your girlfriend ""exploring"" on a dating site? Seeing, out of curiosity, what her online popularity is like? 

If I were dating you and you asked for this, it would seriously damage my attraction to you and my trust in you, even if you accepted a ""no"". "
"As someone married to a bisexual woman who has never so much as kissed another woman -- it IS still a major flavour of the relationship. If I wasn't able to accept her as bisexual, we wouldn't be able to be as open and trusting to each other as we are. She'd either have to lie to me about her sexuality (not good), or live with my disapproval of who she is (probably worse), or both.

Honestly, why would anyone want to be in a relationship with someone who unequivocally rejects a part of who they are? "
"Yes op listen to this. Don't go into it focused just on the sex issues, be concerned for your girlfriend &amp; frame it that way and listen if she opens up. (Absolutely do not press sex if it does turn out to be a trauma, she might need a long time to work through things before she can comfortably have sex.)"
"Just a bit of a theory here, OP. What if this affair started when Catie became more distant from Paul after his cancer diagnosis? Not saying it's right. She just might be having issues coping, or may be she's too immature to cope in a more appropriate manner. It's a good point t that you should find another place to move to if you get involved. Have you considered talking to Catie before talking to Paul? I don't know if this is the best course of action, but I think I might talk o her first and perhaps let her know that you know and she should tell Paul herself or you will. After you find an alternative living arrangement, of course. "
"First things first: It is NOT your responsibility to share the adulterous information.  That is their shit storm to deal with.  You have NO role in it.  You are not related to them and you are not their friend. You are the paid babysitter, and your role is to take care of the kids.  Sharing this info can have consequences for the family (of course)... but more importantly for YOU as well.  What if one of them becomes violent? You don't want to be caught in the middle of this. Do not get involved.

That said, I get that you love the kids and don't want to see them hurt.  But you can't protect them from the emotional drama their parents choose to engage in.  it is entirely your decision whether or not you can stomach the possibility watching a family go through what promises to be a very upsetting episode of Days of Our Lives one day.

"Honestly you could use some help to deal with anger, but only after you get into a safe environment. But don't apologize to anybody. I don't see Cliff apologizing.

"""Honestly, I don't want to see him anymore. I get angry and sick when he calls and texts."" 

I hunk that's your answer right here. What's next? Pranking you about your grandpas death or something equally disturbing? "
"Thanks for that, but what on earth does it have to do with sleeping with a bra on? Were you initially drawn to your wife because she removes her bra when she's home? You aren't making sense, man. "
"I think the claim ""everybody is tempted to stray at some point"" is pretty hyperbolic. I've never wanted to cheat on a partner. I've thought what-ifs as far as would I be happier single, but I've never considered cheating. And that seems to be the case in my social circle as well. 

Being honest about being an asshole doesn't make you less of one."
"The mind is a fickle thing, that's for sure. I imagine while she was at home not exercising her options she was imagining what he was doing and I doubt it was just him going out and getting some strange.

I would bet her continued agitation isn't just his high numbers... but imagining the miniature relationships that may have developed. It's kind of mindfuck at first to accept that your person isn't just screwing and leaving with a handshake. Especially if they're seeing one person multiple times.

It makes it real. And makes it threatening. Is he pining for the other girl? Did he see things in her he doesn't get from me? Does he miss the sex with her?

If you've been someone else too, it's easy to empathize. Like, yeah I liked this guy and enjoyed time spent with him... buuuuut I like my person all the time. You can't really see that unless you've been there."
"Well, no, his preference is his preference and he's allowed to have it.

I think what people are trying to say is that she deserves someone who wouldn't expect her to fit his ideal at the cost of actual pain to herself, especially since he knew she had body hair when they got together. He's allowed to prefer hairless women, but the way he's going about it makes him an asshole. 

I don't think anyone here is saying he has to stay. She's better off without him imo -- but he's kind of a dick whether he leaves or not."
"If your husband is none the wiser about how you're feeling, then you may need to do more than simply ask that your BIL move out.  Perhaps, couch it in terms of the BIL affecting your ability to feel fully in your wonderful 2-person marriage because he is around all the time.  It's a fine line to skate where you're not trying to come off as unfeeling and not trying to hint at the true reason you want him gone, while spinning this as a positive step to a healthier marriage (which it is)."
"OP here, thanks for the feedback. I already knew that the relationship couldn't and shouldn't be salvaged. More scared of not having someone around all the time after a year and a few months with one person and needed affirmation. Her and I being perfect together was definitely an exaggeration, sorry I shouldn't have worded it that way. We share a lot in common and always had fun together when things were going well and made a lot of memories/effected each other positively from the start but it turned south. Legally speaking I am obligated to report this whether it's a lie or not so am I still meeting with the title 9 coordinator; however I am basically going to read this post off to her. She actually knows me quite well due to my job on campus and will provide good insight into how to move forward with this, get the help my ex needs to get through this if it's true or how to mediate the situation so no parties are effected legally or negatively if she is lying about it all. Thank you again for all your responses. I know it sounds weak and hard to believe that one can fall prey to the mentality I have now but love can do some crazy things. Something I have to work on personally "

"They ARE being rude to her. In fact, pointedly leaving gay conversion pamphlets around when your gay daughter and her partner arrive is worse than rude. Do you actually know what gay conversion therapy involves? 

A quick little quote about the results from modern day conversion therapy: ""Many participants felt harmed by the attempt to change, and reported depression, suicidal ideation and attempts, hypervigilance of gender-deviant mannerisms, social isolation, fear of being a child abuser and poor self-esteem""

"I think you're right. I've always felt like I was being excessively rude to people not engaging them in conversation, and it felt *bad*. I don't like that change in myself that I'm being forced to be rude to people. It feels a rejection of part of my identity.

But reading the hundreds of different ways other people are putting it in these comments, yours included, it doesn't sound rude. It sounds like I'm just not ready to engage in tiresome bullshit and it's the other person's problem to deal with.

""That's not appropriate, this stops now"" and handing them a card with the info about her on it sounds the go."
"You're trying to convince him that he didn't confirm the plans with you by sending him screenshot of your texts, etc. But at the same time, if you guys had been talking about this wouldn't you maybe put it tentatively in your calendar so if something else came up you knew it was intended for that weekend? He's lame for not confirming details, but you totally blew it too and should give up the attempts to convince him it's not your fault. Can't you reschedule your Niagara Falls weekend with the gf? "

"You're 13; that kind of get-together is extremely inappropriate for someone of your age. But let's say that you did end up going. What are you actually going to do? You can't drink alcohol and you can't get a lapdance, and your BIL and his friends aren't going to want to look after a 13 year old while they're partying. You'll end up feeling out of place and you most likely won't have very much fun. I'm with your sisters and mother on this one."

"Not anywhere near as much as you love your dick.  

Look, you've ruined your relationship.  Completely.   No amount of self pity or pretending you're just too young for monogamy makes any difference.  Nothing you can ever say or do will fix what you've done.  You're a liar and a cheater, that's just the way it is.  You may not be in the futur in your next relationship, but as far as you're girlfriend goes, that's your identity.  That's who you'll always be to her.

Let your girlfriend go.  Don't make this worse by trying to trick her into agreeing to an open relationship so you can bang whoever you want without pretending to feel guilty.  Tell her she needs to get tested and end things."
"Are deep, artsy conversations something you expect your partner to provide?

There are things I love to talk about, that I don't talk about with my partner. He doesn't have to be all things to me. There are other people in the universe for interesting conversation. The fact that other people are interesting to talk too, doesn't threaten our relationship.

If you aren't happy with his communication style, that's a bit more serious, but also not necessarily a dealbreaker. 

Only you can decide what you need from your relationship, but I'd encourage you to consider the fact that one person can't be everything to another.

"
Why are you subjecting yourself to it then coming here for a magic wand. You are the one subjecting you to his lies and only you can decide you hsve had enough and leave him. Nothing we can say will help you change the compulsion he has to lie. So decide. Do you want to live with his lies and accept his excuse for the creepy word doc or do you want to break up.
"Telling someone ""I can't be with a significant other unless we're out together and visible"" and then letting your SO make their own decision is different than ""if you don't do X, I'm leaving!"" Surely you understand that. "
"But the baby talk *is* him. As evidenced by the fact that he is doing it right out of the gate and with zero shame. I think you need to consider that he baby talks because he's, well, a big baby. He feels like a big cutesy, pouty baby inside and you are seeing that manifested in his language and communication. If baby talk comes out when he's happy, you can almost certainly bet it will come out when he's sad. 

Don't get stuck in a 'if only he didn't use baby talk' fantasy. This is how he expresses himself, so that should be a pretty clear indicator of what his 'self' is."

&gt;claiming that the game ships were an ""investment"" and that he would make more money off them than he had spent

They aren't and he won't. 

Yes he has gone too far (waaayyy too far) and has shown a complete lack of common sense. You should seriously consider if this is the sort of future you want. Husband does something inexplicably stupid with money but can't see why it's stupid? You think this won't happen again? Time for some home truths and pre-marital and financial counselling. "
"keep one thing in mind: he does that for a living. He talks to people in your or similar or 1000 times weirder situations every day. So no matter how uncomfortable it seems, he's had this conversation many times, and has dealt with way more awkwardness than you could cause. 

just be as clear as possible so that he can do best from a medical perspective.

"What is the money *for*, if not for living your life in an enjoyable way? Suffer all your life, die rich?"
"So, your daughter dared to answer honestly, and your wife is so sensitive and overbearing that she decided that she had to insult your daughter over a perceived wrong...and is now upset that your daughter dared to defend herself? The only selfish one here is your wife, who seems to think she is owed a grandchild. 

That is what I got from that. Your wife sounds awful, and your daughter just gave an honest answer. 

Your wife doesn't deserve an apology just because she didn't like the answer to a question. I have the feeling that Colleen is probably owed a lifetime of apologies.... "
"You know that phrase of 'your experience is not universal'? 

This is really unusual for a mother to be like that. Honestly, I've never known a person to feel that way. Actually I have, one was my sister's aunt, and she referred to her baby as 'the alien growing inside me' and the other was a manager of mine who said she wasnt bothered because she'd rather not believe it was happening. Both of those are unusual situations. 

Differing opinions are great, you dont have to apologise. But suggesting that no one should want to be there for their partner for support, or help because 'nothing is happening' is quite rude to those who have found so much joy in those little moments. Or for people like my friend who was rushed into hospital and had to stay there until they could safely induce her. her husband didnt leave her side. And that's the normal, usual way people behave during a pregnancy. 

I dont know how it wasnt possible to bond with your partner during pregnancy, or that you thought there was nothing to bond over, maybe your pregnancy was easier than most others. 
its not getting excited about being fat, its getting excited about the life growing inside you, that you both made. I personally do not want children. never have. And actually, pregnancy scares the crap out of me. I touched my friend's tummy because she basically grabbed my hand while he was kicking and I told her I'd never really seen it before.. It completely weirded me out, to be quite honest. It was mindblowingly strange to know a little kid is in there, wriggling around. 

But I wouldnt dare say to her that she didnt 'need' her partner to be there. because she was also hospitalised from a severe iron deficiency. It's not all smooth sailing til the finish line. "
"&gt;  My SO was so scared I'd get suspicious and catch her that the week she was fucking around was the week she was more reliable and responsive than usual.

Ok. First post I thought therapy. Second post has me leaning towards divorce. 
"You need to sit down with him and have a serious talk, because the way he's reacting to this conflict is seriously inappropriate. He's being a dick and if this is going to act when you have problems moving forward, you relationship is destined to crash and burn.

He found out he forgot your birthday in an embarrassing way, yes. But he's taking it out on you when he was the one who screwed up, and he's holding you to a nonsensical standard to do it. That's a red flag, to say the least."
"So it isn't just the going to bed thing that he's unreasonable about.  I think you seriously need to examine your relationship here.  These things aren't healthy.  Constantly accusing you of not loving him if you don't do what he wants is immature and controlling.  Same with calling you a liar.  

I would insist on couple's therapy, at the very least.  This shit needs to stop.  "
"Listen. I am not emperor of the world and I did not set all the laws.

However, I will point out, that the interests of the state do not neatly line up with the interests of every single citizen at the time frame of that citizen.

The state, for instance, is not interested in encouraging the foreclosure of its existence at the end of a generation, in fact, many modern nations are taking active steps to *encourage* child-bearing because many of these nations do not have enough children to replace the current working population.

On the other hand, an individual building owner is not personally invested in what happens after their lifetime, and would therefore not be always inclined to rent to people with children. This goes absolutely against the state's interests, and therefore they disallow it.

Elderly people, on the other hand, provide different issues for the government-- and again, is another population they are actively involved in supporting, though this time with social security and medicare. Communities which are aimed to providing the specific needs of an aging population, therefore, take some of the burden off of the government that it otherwise would have had to shoulder, given the modern welfare state as it exists, and therefore are given leeway to operate away from laws which otherwise would restrict their existence.

The government's laws are not built to provide the easiest life for the able bodied, working professional or the maximum income to a building owner. The government's laws are built to provide for the future of the nation, even for people not yet in existence, and for the safety and comfort of the elderly, so they do not die in abject poverty.

Again, I am not in charge of the galaxy and if I were things might look different, but the current system is not nearly as stupid as you are making it out to be."

"It's also INCREDIBLY dangerous. If he had done this and CPS had ended up involved for some reason, do you think they will take your word for it that you didn't know? Your kid could get taken away from *both* of you for that! For the sake of your daughter, you need to get out of this relationship, pronto. As long as you are in a relationship with him, if he does something that stupid you could *both* be on the hook. You need to put as much distance (figuratively) between you two as possible. "
"Even after the two years you will still be under scrutiny.  In fact, divorcing after that time period is probably when they look the hardest.  Interview your friends and family, everything.

Especially with *new* neighbours.
Okay so your fiance married someone else and then came home to you? What?
"Me and Jack share a bank account, contribute towards a mortgage, and our joint account paid for the new Mondeo.

No, he doesn't do stupid stuff like this all the time, he's normally quite chilled-out, but this is weird. Odd.

"I'm not poly myself, but I know those relationships work for a lot of people and I don't have any issues with that.

That said, this particular situation really makes me really uncomfortable.  Yeah, you were up front with Paul about your husband being your primary relationship and the fact you would end things with Paul if it ever became an issue in your marriage.  And yeah, he's an adult and chose to be involved with you on those terms.

But at the same time, Paul has severe depression he refuses to treat, you got involved when he was vulnerable following a very bad breakup and a string of self-destructive relationships, he has no one else in his life who he's close to or can get emotional support from, and you've now spent *six years* building a relationship with him in which you two are in love and he is emotionally dependent on you.

The fact that you're poly and have a different primary relationship doesn't mean you shouldn't treat your secondary partner with care and respect, especially a secondary you have a years-long ""we're in love"" relationship with.  Take the poly factor out entirely, and pretend you'd told him up front that you just didn't want to be in a serious relationship with anyone and he agreed to the same kind of no-strings-attached situation in that context, and then spent six years telling him you love him and listening to him say you're the only person he can rely on for emotional support even though you remained as willing to abruptly end things as ever, and then similarly decided to dump him out of the blue.  To me, that's deeply irresponsible and cruel behavior on your part.  

Frankly, I don't think you should have engaged in this type of relationship with Paul at all.  It doesn't sound like he had any prior experience with or desire to be poly.  It sounds like he was (and is) in a very vulnerable and lonely place, and he took what he could get from you.  Yes, you warned him you might cut him off at any moment.  But as you recognize, that warning didn't stop him from developing complete emotional dependence on you.  His *words* said ""I know your husband comes first and I'm prepared for things to end abruptly at any time if your marriage requires it.""  His *actions* said ""I'm totally reliant on my relationship with you for my emotional well-being, and would be very seriously damaged by being cut off without warning.""  That's not someone who you should engage in a years-long ""we're in love"" secondary relationship with.

But what's done is done, and obviously you're not obligated to continue a relationship you no longer want.  That said, given the situation you've gotten into here, I think you need to be **really fucking careful** about how you handle ending things with Paul.  Like ""there's an actual chance he might kill himself if this is handled wrong"" kind of careful.  

I honestly don't even know what to suggest in terms of how to do that.  Maybe others will have suggestions.  

I'm struggling not to be too harsh here, because you're obviously concerned for his well-being since you're posting here asking how to minimize the hurt to him.  But at the same time, you're calling him a side piece and don't seem to have any sense that you've already basically burned the campsite to the ground by engaging in this kind of relationship with someone in his damaged state.  

Your reaction to ending this relationship is basically ""well, I'll miss our time together but I'm excited to reconnect with my husband, I just need to let him down gently so he doesn't rebound into dating some awful girl.""  His reaction is likely to be ""I was already so severely depressed that I've been unable to work for years or even keep my living space to a level that doesn't make me deeply ashamed, and I have no goals and no expectation things will improve.  And now I'm completely blindsided by losing the woman I've been in love with for six years who is the only person in the entire world I can open up to or rely on for support, and was basically the only good thing in my life.""  Him dating some awful girl he meets on OKCupid may be a best case scenario here."

"Tell him to imagine his leg is broken. Then give him a list, broken down into tiny baby steps, that explains how to run. Tell him to run.

He can't, and he'll likely say so, because he doesn't seem like a guy who can think terribly critically.

But why? you ask. You've got all the steps right there. Just run, you numpty.

He might say that he literally can't - the parts are broken and they just can't function like a healthy leg.

Then you have a good analogy for Einstein to see why you can't just focus on his condescending plan for you to magically not be depressed anymore. Just because he can't see the problem doesn't mean it isn't there!

Maybe try telling him so. If he's still too much of an arrogant, stubborn jackass to see the flaw in his logic, then buy a copy of Depression for Dummies and shove it far enough up his ass that there's no longer any room for his head there.

"You were very clear in what you said to Amy and her parents.  But yet there was still a misunderstanding.  Why do you think that is?  You say in another comment ""The room is whatever I say it is."" and that is true, it is your room.  But the words you use have certain associations and expectations and people will interpret them in ways you do not intend, no matter how clear you are or how many rules you create.   I'm suggesting a way you can communicate differently and still get what you want without changing those rules. "
"&gt;Why shouldn't it be normal for friends to cuddle? Why are people expected to close themselves off emotionally to all but one person?

That's a weird leap.  You can be *emotionally* open to other people without *physical* intimacy like cuddling.

At any rate, nonsexual physical intimacy doesn't have to be reserved exclusively for one person if you and your romantic partner both agree it's okay to do that kind of thing with other people.  Just like sexual physical intimacy also doesn't have to be reserved exclusively for your romantic partner, if you both agree to an open relationship or poly set up.  But the default is that you don't get physically intimate with other people absent such agreement, because *most* people aren't okay with their partners doing that kind of thing with other people.

Why?  Because it's easy for lines to blur or be crossed once you start down the road of physical intimacy.  You have a good friend you're emotionally close to, great.  You have a close friend you're emotionally close to and also spend the night cuddling in bed with, there's no longer a clear distinction between platonic friend and intimate romantic partner.  If holding someone's body in bed isn't reserved only for your partner, why is kissing?  I mean, a little peck on the lips is a lot less intimate and potentially sexual than full-body cuddling.  If a peck on the lips is okay, does it cross the line if it lasts three seconds?  Five?  When tongue gets involved? 

So yeah, I've cuddled non-sexually with people before when I was single.  But I don't when I'm dating someone, because even if it doesn't *have* to be sexual or romantic, the best way to ensure you don't slide into sexual or romantic behavior is to set a clear line of no physical intimacy with other people.  

And the hard line is especially important because humans are excellent at self-justification and deception when it allows them to keep doing something they enjoy.  If you just decide up front on a hard boundary, you won't do what OP did here:  convince himself in the moment that the cuddling was totally nonsexual because he really wanted to do it, even though it's abundantly clear that he does in fact have feelings for Lucy and that it wasn't nonsexual at all."

"So, sometimes I shorten words. For example a croutons may become ""crouts.""

My girlfriend is a stickler for proper grammar and language. So, when she noticed me doing it she told me it bothered her. Wanna know what I did? I stopped doing it.

"Yes, it is fair to ask her to put a limit on how often he stays over, or to ask to split utilities and rent, or to ask to limit common area time with him.  Figure out what you want to have happen, and talk to her about it.  Expect to negotiate some.

"&gt;  I'm open to being in a relationship on the grounds that he never dictate what I wear, say, who I hang out with or how I choose to conduct myself. I expressed to him that I want to remain an independent individual with my own identity. 

This is an excellent limit that you set. 

This guy is much older than you, and often much older guys seek out younger women because they want someone to dominate, not an equal partner. This seems to be the dynamic that your boyfriend wants. 

If somebody asked you to, say, chop off your arm, does that mean that you should compromise and only chop off half your arm? 

Just because there are two opposing points of view doesn't mean that they are equally valid. 

If you give up your friends and mode of dress for this guy, the next steps may include cutting off your family, getting ""accidently"" pregnant, quitting your job, moving way out to an isolated place with no way to get around, etc. 

Abusers almost always start off loving and amazing and perfect. Because of the age difference, he knows exactly what to do and say in order for you to say things like, ""have never met someone who understands me on this level,"" just as you would be able to do if you were sociopathic enough to want to seduce a 16-year-old. 

It is all an act. The controlling guy? That's the real him. 

You could try reiterating your original limits, but he has no intention of respecting them. You need to get out of this. 

Am I speaking too extremely? How about this example. You buy a new house. It is a beautiful dream house at an amazing price. The only thing is that on hot days, the rotting corpses in the basement make the house smell funny. 

Is that an ok house to live in? 

But don't take my word for it. Go onto loveisrespect.org and take the quizzes. Look up everything you can on abusive relationships and how they start. 

You need to break up with him by phone or text, block him, and when he curses at you, verbally abuses you, and accuses you of horrible things, remind yourself that you are seeing the real person. 

If he tells you, oh, sorry, don't throw our beautiful love away, I have depression and I've been under a lot of stress at work, etc., don't let him rope you back in. "

If he really feels the need to explore that strongly, nothing's stopping him from breaking up with you and being single for a while, or finding someone who's more into the idea of open relationships (although he's probably going to have a hard time finding someone who'd put up with the double standards he's trying to impose).

"You wouldn't need him to fully communicate that he's going through a bad phase, you would recognize that he's more withdrawn or moodier, perhaps snapping at you or asking for more time alone. You'd notice these things because it would be way outside of how he normally acts. 

In your case this isn't a bad phase, he sees you as something that belongs to him, that he can control. The way he wrote about you in his post is disgusting and cruel.

Maybe you only love me for those 'shallow' reasons like my brain and personality but WHAT ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT, MY LOOKS IN 20 YEARS? BTW Can you tell I'm secretly extremely insecure still and not thinking rationally about this at all anymore? Bet you didn't know about this side of me huh!""

Yea OP, honestly I don't know if you should even mention it. You stretched ""not very attractive"" into ""ugly/unattractive"" in your mind, and somehow linked the one statement over to how your friends and coworkers treat you and compliment you and how you work out etcetc. Way overthinking it.  

Work on your insecurity instead. No one called you unattractive. It is not a crime either to not be ""very attractive"" to the world. You know which type of people ARE considered to be ""very attractive"" from a general sense? Models. They are literally paid to be 'very attractive'.

You not being a model is just facts. On top of that, your bf said even 1.5 years ago that you were attractive to HIM. So what are you trying to get out of a conversation? What is your end goal?? To get him to admit that you ARE very attractive to the entire world despite no factual basis? To get him to secretly admit that he actually thought you were ugly this entire time even though there's been NO indication of that either?

**If you have a conversation with him, the only purpose is to sooth your insecurity. However, insecurity is something that is better worked out on your own. As you can see, all his soothing and confident words in the past did NOTHING in the end to boost your inner confidence. One small line from the past which wasn't even that bad undid ALL his work in the past 1.5 yrs of complimenting you and loving you.**

So trust me when I say that another conversation with him on this topic will not help you, and it will not help him. You gotta fix this about yourself on your own, because you are deeply insecure about your looks for absolutely no reason."

"Waiting is only going to make it worse because he's escalating the blame.   He's not going to suddenly realize that he's responsible, he's going to make it worse like you did it on purpose.  This has gone past grief, and it's not acceptable for him to treat you this way.   I think the relationship is hanging in the balance.

I'd tell him, ""I've sat down and meditated over my actions for three weeks, I have not touched that gate.  The only person who has reason to touch the gate is you.  If you  think that I would lie about something like this then there really isn't anything left to this relationship.""

If he takes what you said as blaming him say, ""I don't know what happened, and since I don't know what happened I would ever blame anyone.  withou more data speculation would be pointless.""

If he really thinks you did this, the relationship will never recover."

But he might say no. He might not like the idea of plastic surgery. He might say that you should wait a few years until you are older, because 17 isn't necessarily done with puberty/body changes and because people at 17 tend to be more confident, and when they are older, more accepting. 


You say money is not object, but do you actually know how expensive a surgery is and how much your dad actually has? Why does your step mom leaving him mean that he has a lot of extra money? Especially if you want him to pay for things like college.

You are a singer--have you looked into how a nose job could affect your singing. You might think you look better when performing, but it could completely change your sound.

"&gt; 
Your first example, when we know it. How would that come across? Like how would I see the difference between those two if he doesn't explicitely communicate it?

**Bad Phase:**

* Something happened recently to cause the behavior; a trigger, if you will. (Job loss, recent death of someone close, depression)

* Behavior is temporary, or sudden, or out of the ordinary. (AKA, it's not just his personality)

* It is distinguishable from how he has acted in the past

* He recognizes that something is ""off""

**Destructive Personality:**

* The behavior has been present in the past, just perhaps in a more hidden/less obvious manner.

* It doesn't have to do with an external factor.

* The behavior isn't just reactive; it reflects deep-seated views that he has about the world. (For example, snapping at you because he's stressed from work vs. snapping at you because he thinks you've violated something he believes to be true)

* Unwilling to admit that anything is wrong.

* Tied to a lack of respect for other person/people."

"My wife and I got into a situation like that with a friend/former coworker of hers and her a husband a couple of years ago. We're about the same age as you are and her friend was a couple of years older; the husband was closer to 15 years older than us. Her friend's husband was pretty similarly obnoxious on social media, which was funny considering he was an incredibly passive (like almost pathetically so) person in real life.

He developed an extremely, uh, interesting interpretation of Christianity that colored literally every aspect of his life. For example, when Robin Williams committed suicide, he commented on *every* update that any of his friends posted about it on Facebook saying something to the effect of ""you can feel bad for his family, but he made his choices, and he is in Hell now"" and would just fucking lay into anyone who challenged him on it or who said ""dude, come on, he's dead."" Blow-ups of this type were pretty common to the point that everything he posted was related in some way to a current event or a famous person and how God was offended by them. 

Then he started repeatedly posting things to the effect of ""if you aren't a Bible-believing Christian, we can no longer be friends or family."" He started finding Satanic/occult/anti-Christian/whatever themes and influences basically everywhere he looked and would call people out for things like playing video games or watching TV shows/movies he didn't approve of. Note that throughout this whole bizarre incident his wife was basically nonexistent on social media. We suspected that he was either monitoring or directly controlling her access to the internet.

Apparently it all came to a head on Christmas of 2014. I say ""apparently"" because my wife and I weren't aware of it until after the fact. We posted a joke photo of our Christmas tree with a Cthulhu plush doll in the place of where the star or angel would go. A few days went by without the characteristic rants about Obama or how tattoos made you a ""painted whore"" and we discovered that both he and his wife blocked us. We have not heard from or seen either of them since then.

All of this is to say that what will likely happen is that her husband will eventually make the choice for you (and her) and just cut off all avenues of communication. Even though we doubt he's ever physically abused her (or ever would; I doubt he could work up the nerve to hit someone IRL) obviously he's abused her from the standpoint of isolating her. A major issue in their relationship is that they got together when she was a senior in high school and he was in his mid-30s. She was involved in some, shall we say, unsavory things and she credits him with ""saving"" her from it. I'm not sure how that really works since he was actually part of the group of people encouraging her to do this stuff, but whatever. People often rationalize why they're with abusive partners so they don't personally feel like failures. She's eventually going to just have to come to the realization herself and take the necessary steps to correct it. Your role in it unfortunately is going to be a passive one of just waiting for her to want to get out."
"Not bluntly. It will probably end badly.

Pictures are often unflattering. Go with her to her next fitting and see it in person. You may like it more there! If you really want to push it, you can find some other dresses online or in the same shop that are similar in style and encourage her to try those on to compare, and then you can sit down with her and weigh the pros and cons of each dress. If she feels happy/beautiful/sexy/comfortable/whatever in the dress, then that's the dress for her, and you shouldn't try to change that, or make her feel self-conscious on her wedding day.

If you two have a relationship where being completely honest is always welcome, you could tell her (IN PERSON) that you really liked this other, specific dress on her because she looked so happy/beautiful/sexy/comfortable/whatever in it, and that maybe she should try it again to compare. But if you don't have that relationship, or if she's swept up in wedding emotions, imagine a giant ball of flame hurtling at your friendship.

My best friend's dress made her look like a damned Disney movie wedding cake (not a bride, a layer cake) and I kept my mouth hella shut. She and I have a very honest, blunt relationship, but she had become bridezilla, and you don't pick a fight with bridezilla. To this day she loves the dress. And I have still kept my mouth shut. Maybe in another 10 years we'll be drunk on wine and I'll tell her. Maybe I'll get punched in the face. Maybe she'll laugh and say she agrees. It's such a touchy thing, weddings."

"One thing that helped for me is taking a look at the anxiety and realizing where it comes from. It isn't just her gaslighting causing it- why you're so afraid of the possibility of being 'wrong' about something is how she reacted when you were 'wrong'. Every time you say something or think something you feel the need to backpedal and say that you could be wrong, because when you asserted yourself about something, you were facing hours of screaming and belittling. 

Right now you've still got programmed in deep the 'oh god no' feeling when you say something, because you're afraid that response is going to happen. So you backtrack and doubt yourself and keep questioning things, because if you don't, you think you're going to be back in that place again.

Well I guess she thinks you want to fuck your brother. Seems normal
"Dogs thrive on novelty, and one of the outcomes of novelty is that it wears them out. No offense, but your backyard isn't all that interesting.

Hope this helps!! Plus down the line, your whole family will benefit from getting in the habit of going for walks. "
"He's trying to exaggerate how ""bad"" the wedding was and what an ""ordeal"" it was to try and sidetrack you from his godawful behaviour surrounding it. "

"I don't know about the legal aspects, but I'm surprised that the apartment manager didn't have something to say about this.

"&gt; But it still sucks to potentially lose a friend.

It sucks, sure. But her? In your previous post, you haven't really stated **why** you wanted to be friends with this girl after what she did. You acknowledged she was manipulative, an unrepentant liar, an irresponsible partner and friend, a cheater, and that you were somewhat resentful of her reckless behavior... but yet, all that seemed to fly over your head, and you downplayed it as much as possible, and wanted to keep the friendship. Why?

.

I think you need to take a long hard look at the reasons of why you wish to keep such toxic company around you."
Why are you waiting? See the doctor NOW. 
"&gt;  Basically, we text about [...] issues she has with men...

Inappropriate.  You're this girl's emotional sponge not only at work, but after work as well.  You're serving the same purpose as some guy who has been friendzoned.  You can try to rationalize it however you want, but friendzone is how people will perceive this.

Your commitment and time are two important virtues you have, and you are spending them on another girl.  In her book, that's emotional cheating--which some women (actually, most I've heard from) think is even worse than sexual cheating.

Mentor all you want, but there's no professional reason to do so outside of work.  She *can* have your number just in case, just like she would have anyone else's number that you work with (in case of emergencies).  But to be spending your time guiding her through life can very easily become romantic, especially if she respects you.

When you share ""random stuff"" with potential partners, you start to form emotional bonds that are **very** hard to break.  When you appropriately start ghosting this girl outside of work hours, and in a personal way at work, it's unlikely she will be able to act normal.  You're going to have to be extremely careful pulling away from this girl, especially since you're her mentor at work."

"&gt;and he might change his mind about children!

That's a pretty big ""might"" which, from what I've seen in almost ever post here, isn't something I should count on. I appreciate your input, but the more I think about it, the more obvious it is what I have to do. Believe me the last thing I want to do is hurt him, but my question wasn't *if* I should break up with him, but when and how to do it humanely."
"Because it kind of speaks for itself that when you regard someone as a sibling, those lines were never crossed nor is or has there ever been any intentention to do so. 

I have 2 very close friends who I've known since I was little. One is a man, the other a woman. I'm bisexual. Does that mean I can never camp with those friends (or anyone, for that matter) except my SO?

Edit to clarify that I think a 'sibling' relationships as I and chunasalad described are possible and counter CulinaryAustin's assumptions on these relationships in general. However, I do not think that this type of relationship is applicable to the situation as described by the OP. The fact that the guy has confessed love, has never met OP, as well as other red flags named by chunasalad make this a completely different situation, which I agree is inappropriate."
"So, in other words:  yes, you are trapped?

"Your friends are a bunch of assholes who think they're being edgy instead of cruel. If you don't ditch them outright, which would be perfectly justifiable, then you should confront them and let them know they fucked up.

And stop playing that game, it sounds awful."
"I think OP could just be self-deprecating, too. 

I get this comment occasionally (""Your boyfriend is so sweet and nice, I'm surprised you guys get along so well!"", etc.). 90% of the time, it is not meant maliciously. I am a bull-in-a-china-shop, talk-first-think-later, hundred-miles-a-minute mind of person. I am *not* rude (I'll say *stupid* shit, but it's not mean or insulting), except that I can be a bit of a bulldozer in conversation. (But I'm not dismissive and will happily apologize: just a bit blind/tactless.) This description makes me sound like an asshole, but I'm really not. I'm a little neuroatypical, and definitely an odd duck, but I grow on people. I make good friends easily, and keep them. 

When people ask me ""your boyfriend is so nice, why is he dating you?"", they usually *actually mean it as a question*. They look at me and think ""you thrive on sound and argument, I would expect that whoever could deal with that would have to be equally brash."" And they look at my very calm, funny, quiet boyfriend and are like... ""You picked to be with a loudmouth why, exactly?""

And there is an answer! He somehow doesn't find my flaws to be flaws, just personality traits. He likes babble and being able to ""talk"" to each other without actually doing any of the labor in carrying the conversation (unless and until he wants to). I'm extremely good-natured about being behavior-corrected or made fun of, so he can just ask me to shut up if he wants quiet or thinks I'm being rude. He'd be miserably bored with someone as quiet and introspective as he is, because he's actually pretty extroverted. And in the reverse, I would be miserably exhausted with someone who's as always-on as I am, because I'm actually pretty introverted, and being around him makes me feel like the world isn't spinning as fast. 

The question  gets phrased as ""why is THE NICE ONE with THE WEIRD ONE"" because of the market reality: anyone would want to date a sweet, nice person, but far fewer people would be interested in dating a weird person. 

At the core of the question is math: it seems like the two people in the relationship aren't a good fit for each other, but they seem extremely happy with each  other, so the person asking the question is trying to ""solve for x."" 

Someone once pitched me the same question in a much more accurate and less offensive way: ""What parts of you does he see that no one else does?"" THAT'S the thrust of the question, and it doesn't necessarily mean ""there must be something about you that he sees and we don't, because no one in their right mind would date you as is."" 

(This notion is also the thought process behind a personal policy of mine: if I really like and respect a person, and that person seems deeply in love and grateful for their SO, I will befriend and get to know the SO *even if I don't like them at first*. The idea is that there must be something great about them, if my friend, whose judgment I trust, is in love with them. This has a 100% success rate to date.)"
"To some men, a woman who has some basic self respect makes her a ""psycho"". 

It sounds like it is a great thing that he is out of your life. You are NOT a ""psycho"", and please don't let that loaded, sexist word worry you at all. He was doing something SUPER shady, you were upset, you tried to talk to him, he did what guilty people do and tried to make YOU out to be the bad person. ""How dare you confront me on my bad behavior! How dare you not let it slide! You're a psycho for calling me out!"" 
 
You did the right thing. "

"&gt;I thought I will find nice people here to put me on the straight line.

I think we're being pretty nice (at least compared to how bad we can get), it's just that we're telling you the truth and it's not what you want to hear.  You are looking for one of us to say ""It's not a big deal"", but it is.

By your boyfriend's definition, you've cheated.  There's no changing that.  You can ""try to spare his feelings"" by not telling him, but then ask yourself what type of person that makes you?  Can you wake up every morning and lie to the person who you claim to love?  If you're OK with that idea, then it says a lot about you. 

And you did it in front of witnesses.  So even if it doesn't get back to your BF and his GF (which I doubt), people will have seen you flirting with this guy knowing that you have a boyfriend.  What do you think their opinion of you is now?  "
"You're a horrible person. You know exactly what he's been through yet yet cheated on him anyway? You constantly complain that he's jealous yet have you ever wondered why? He clearly has a good reason to be suspicious because you DID cheat on him. 

Stop trying to play the victim here. You flirted with this guy and then let him kiss your neck for an hour before you told him to stop. That is still fucking cheating. "
"Oh no he has never smoked around baby, though he doesn't see the big deal. She hasn't left my sight yet. We have argued about it before is what I meant."
"Tell her that you're very worried.

"Wow. Jealous of a pregnant woman. 
Yeah, sadly you have been introduced to one of the harsh truths of being married to someone who is pretty damned cool and for whom pregnancy is seemingly a breeze. There are people who take that kind of thing very personally and turn bitches to make themselves feel better.

""She's an admin and she's cute and I HATE HER for that so I'm gonna say mean things and I don't care who hears me.""

"This! So much this! My neighbors had a son with junior diabetes. Without fail, every time they'd go out of town, the paramedics would be called because Junior had a party, drank too much, and his sugars got out of whack. When they were home, it was seldom an issue. Junior got a little crazy and didn't manage things well on his own. We used to joke that whenever we saw a lot of cars in the driveway that they'd need to make room for the ambulance. They typically didn't. I worried about that kid though, especially when he went off to college. "
"Why is she claiming your Dad's apartment as her own? That seems really strange. Plus you're family, she's not. She should explain herself instead of grilling a family member who is allowed over like that. Seems like she is taking too many liberties with your Dad's apartment and you.

I would want to know if someone I was dating was rude or pushy with my family, especially my children.  Tell your Dad."
"Girl literally this morning my boyfriend and I also got brunch. But the place looked busy walking in so my boyfriend said, ""if the wait is longer than 30 minutes let's find a different place.

You shouldn't have ignored him. And he shouldn't have just left you. You need to approach each other with maturity and empathy. "
"The police really *can't* help. They can go with her to the apartment (if they're so inclined), and wait with her as she rings the doorbell and asks for her stuff (hoping he will be intimidated enough to let her in), but if he lies or tells her to fuck off then they can't do anything beyond that. She'd have to go to court, and unless she's storing high-end designer clothing or expensive electronics there, the cost won't be worth it."
I agree. My hubby would never put me in an unsafe situation. Especially if i tell him i feel unsafe.... He then goes out if his way to make me feel safe.

That is acceptable, it has only been 6 months.  
It is probably best to mentally prepare yourself to move on, but are you able to speak with her and get a few more details so that you have closure?  
Maybe ask why she is feeling this way, what is going on with her, etc.  
Is it really just that she is not able to engage in a relationship at this time?  

Things like that."
"I did something similar. He spent **two years** trying to get back in touch claiming to be worried about me. Interestingly, he always had stories about ""crazy ex-girlfriends"" and ""the one that got away."" (The latter always said with great nostalgia to make me jealous.) In hindsight, he made them all crazy, and the few that got away were the ones who wouldn't tolerate his bullshit and bounced. During the relationship, he always said I was crazy, but once I ghosted him I'm sure he's now telling his next victims I'm the one that got away.

"I don't mean this in a mean way, but you've gone from a reasonable weight to morbidly obese. It's not shallow that he is not longer attracted to you, and Viagra or a doctor can't get him there. 

You can seek counseling, and probably should, but you should also seek more medical help. There are medical problems that make it difficult to lose weight. But no medical problem on Earth, short of a tumor, can make you unable to lose weight from 316 pounds. You say you've tried every diet under the sun - have you tried a simple food tracker and put in your calories honestly? 

This is a major incompatibility, and it will be difficult to solve. If counseling doesn't help, you honestly might be better off leaving, for both of your sakes. For your own sake, though, you need to keep pursuing medical advice. "

"Agreed.  This is a very challenging type of relationship to be in and if you find yourself dreading your husband enjoying it, it's not for you."
"OP I just want you to know that I know how horrible this is for you and my thoughts are with you. 

I was adopted as a baby by a white couple, so it was a little different for me because I just grew up with their attitudes being ""normal."" I won't go into detail because I'm trying to keep this short, but one incident that will set the tone is when Dad stopped the car when I was a kid because he saw a black/white interracial couple kissing on the lawn of their house and wanted to make sure the (white) woman ""was okay."" A few more obvious ones like that, a few n-bombs, and a whole bunch of subtle incidents and I had a lot of fear and self loathing about my own identity by the time I was an adult, and it took me that long to finally let go of the bullshit. 

 My parents would never refer to me in that kind of context, but it's only because they mentally removed me from any ""nonwhite"" mental category on account of being their daughter. My looks are ambiguous so they had a public narrative they could meticulously manage. My father pre-emptively tells every stranger we meet together that I'm indian so people won't think I'm the ""bad"" kind of brown person. My mom forbid me from wearing any style that was ""too black"" for the same reason. A friend of mine as a child gave me braids and I was ecstatic but mom took them out right away etc etc.

I describe this behavior so you will understand the level of cognitive dissonance we are operating here when I tell you they truly do not see any of this. They don't think they're doing anything wrong, they probably don't see a pattern in the things they do, and they would not even understand if I tried to explain to them how these actions are racist and very hurtful to their daughter. To them, even if they said things about ""niggers"" and other horrible things about hispanics and arabs, they don't mentally put me in those categories so they won't make the connection. 

..So they may not be lying to you exactly, so much as they are lying to themselves about their feelings and motives. And also lying to you of course. It sounds like yours are a bit more aware on the surface, but I've grown up in the deep south so I don't want to take openness about racism as awareness of racism, they really aren't the same things.

Which is to say my only advice to you is not to talk to them about this unless you intend to cut contact. If yours are anything like mine they will not *get it*. They are incapable of *getting it*. They will interpret this as you unjustly accusing them of being racist, even if they said some unbelievable shit about ""the blacks"" literally two seconds ago. Don't underestimate the ability to compartmentalize. The conversation will not feel good, it will not accomplish anything, and their genuinely baffled reaction will probably rob you of even the small joy of having given them a piece of your mind. 

I have personally opted for fading/ghosting. I live in a different country and say hi on facebook every couple of months. I can usually get through visiting every 2-3 years or so and just bite my tongue while they are stanning for paula deen or some other bullshit, but feel free to cut out visits if it's too much for you.

I guess that's not happy advice but in my admittedly limited experience, you cannot fix this, and you cannot fix them. The only thing you can do is mange your contact and take solace in the fact that, if they're like mine, they do truly love you. The rest of it still hurts like hell but at least I had a fairly happy childhood with parents who genuinely cared about me despite their issues and I only had to come to terms with the racism shit as an adult, that's more good fortune than a lot of people get. 

Anyway I am congenitally incapable of being brief I guess, so sorry for the tl;dr, but I hope it helps to know you're not the only one dealing with this shit and my heart goes out to you."

She's an adult if she feels like she's not getting attention from you and it's making her sad (which this very well may be a cover for) then she needs to have a grown up conversation with you about her feelings. If she continues with the bullshit then dump her ass and turn the lights off as you leave."
"My SO is from the Midwest, I'm from Texas, and my family is Baptist (I'm not). Conservative/Christian allllll the way.

"This situation is just...odd...

This isn't an ""insecurity"" thing. Even if she dressed like an eskimo, you don't need to constantly hang out with your girlfriend's sister. She's a lot younger, she doesn't sound like she's got much in common with you, etc. You've no business in hanging out with her...you've done your job and it's over.

Your girlfriend is being unreasonable in asking you to hang out with her, let alone rejecting the reasons you told her you don't want to do so. Your reason could literally be, ""Because I want to play video games and not hang out with your sister for lunch,"" and that should be acceptable. Hell, you could just say you're not fond of her and don't want to hang out with her one on one.

But you actually have presented a legitimate reason and she's telling you to get over yourself. Ughhhh, what?

Be a lot more firm with your girlfriend. Tell her that you don't want to hang out with her, period (or that you'd rather she be present if that is acceptable) and that she can hang out with her sister if she's that concerned. However, I fear if this girl is being pushy here, she'll be pushy elsewhere and I'd start examining other areas she might be a bit forceful in."

"Playing Devil's Advocate. From your wife's perspective: *you* wanted the dog, *you* picked out the breed, *you* have taken control of the training.

Of course a puppy needs training, but by your post it seems you've taken over. The third party trainer idea that another Redditor suggested sounds like a great idea. Stop being so stubborn.

Hope that gives you glimpse of that perspective."
"He probably thought it was dried cum from some other guy and is freaking out that you might be cheating on him.

"Actually, I gave several examples; you just cherry picked the one you found most offensive and dismissed the rest. If you dislike that one, feel free to address the others. To refresh, they were:

* **Soldier Uniform vs. Race:** Black youth hiding from Confederate soldier *during* Civil War era, with the entire context that era provides to the uniform.
* **Gang colors** Is it valid to judge the intent/ affiliation of an individual based on the style and color of their attire? Why or why not? 
* **Terrorism profiling** Is it valid to judge the intent/ affiliation of an individual because they are wearing a turban, keffiyeh, taqiyah, hijab, or niqab? Why or why not?

Making sweeping assumptions about the character, intelligence, and morals of other human beings based on the conscious affiliations they choose to signal through their attire is not only a pretty common human behavior, it's one people happily play into in order to broadcast things as varied as status, religious beliefs, political affiliations, fandoms, even preferred corporate brands. 

I'd even go so far as to say in it wouldn't be unreasonable to wonder if someone lacked social intelligence or basic comprehension if they were unable to draw conclusions about another individual based on their choice of attire--if, for example, someone walked into a crowded theater wearing a bulletproof vest that was strapped with ammunition and grenades, and there were two semi-automatic rifles slung over their shoulders, I would argue the *irrational* response would be to say, ""Well, we shouldn't judge one lone gun enthusiast in a theater by the actions of past lone gun enthusiasts who brought an artillery of unnecessary weapons into the theater--I'm sure there's no cause for alarm.""

Police officers don't *fall* into their jobs, any more than soldiers do. They have to seek it out, sign up for it, take a test. Pass training. *Qualify*. They have to, on some level, *want* to represent that uniform, and everything it entails. *Everything*.

Guess what, though? People who put on a uniform to represent a profession or a cause, they don't get to dictate how everyone else sees it. The collective *behavior* of the individuals wearing that uniform determines that, not their intentions or goals--how else did ""Catholic priest"" become almost synonymous with ""pedophile"" in the last decade and a half? That certainly isn't the intention of the Catholic church, or the clergy. It's not in their belief system. And yet, the behavior of innumerable men who donned the mantle of the cloth irrevocably tainted it by association for at least a generation, if not more.

And it's different for race/ sexuality/ gender, because it doesn't matter what race/ sexuality/ gender you were born--you can still choose your affiliations and the attire which is associated with that value system (with, perhaps, the tenuous exception of religion--childhood indoctrination is a powerful tool). 

**A black gay Catholic can serve a term in the military, leave to attend theology school, enter the clergy, realize they're an atheist, leave the clergy, join the police force, and retire after three decades of service and at the end of all that they're *still black and gay* despite the many uniforms they've donned and discarded.**"

See, that's the problem. From what you wrote, he is not open to compromise and expects you to be the one who gives (prob. because you're the woman). He feels he is being gracious and flexible by thinking you could ""just"" stay home for a few years with the kids, rather than be a SAHM. But if you don't want to take more than  few months off, that is not a real compromise. 

Seriously I feel this is just the beginning. You have sooo many differences, and if you have children, it's just going to get worse. He will undoubtedly insist they be baptized and go through confirmation. You'll argue about what schools to go to. He'll insist you be a stay at home mom ""until the kids are old enough."" You'll argue about discipline. You'll feel differently about that gun when you have kids in the house (and a gun loaded with rubber bullets can kill a little kid).

Your problem is that you've been putting up with utterly shitty behavior for ~20 years. You deserve a hell of a lot better than that. When you make your joking little comments and he responds back with stinging rebukes - that's him having pure contempt for you. That's not him loving you. I don't know why on earth you've stayed with him - maybe because you had kids and you felt like you'd fuck them up, who the hell knows. But your kids have been witness to a mother staying with a man who doesn't really give much of a shit about her - except that he'd have an attack of the sads if she left, because he's used to having her around I guess.

I'm not even assuming that you find a perfect partner immediately, but gah, getting out there and enjoying life on your own without a partner that shuts you down and makes you feel like crap - that's so terrific. And when you *do* find someone that really desires you and wants to take you to bed for a terrific romp, and you desire them - wow, that'll be *so* much better than what you've experienced for the past 20 years.

He came away from the experience much more confident and overall pretty happy. I would stress to do your research about doctors first and spare no expense to work with the best as this is a permanent change, and we have some regrets about not shopping around more for the best fit. 

At the end of the day, it's been 9 years since the surgery and most people have forgotten all about it. I feel like we're much better off as his newfound confidence really opened a lot of doors for him career-wise.

The other alternative would be to be to go 180 and just get more involved. Would you feel so sensitive about your inability to participate if you were making a difference in other ways (i.e., getting other people to vote)? It might be worth thinking about. And that would probably stop people from asking you. "

"Maybe it's a super small town or something, but I'm kind of confused as to how she's getting in touch with all these friends of his. Does she find them on Facebook and message them like ""Hi, I fucked your friend two years ago, let's hang out?"" 

The fact that she was at the poker tournament before she knew about OP makes it seem like she was ALREADY part of their friend group."
Fun fact: he's not. I moved far away and things are peaceful and good now.
"She decided she overreacted at the dog, which was true.  She has not come to the conclusion that the baby should not be allowed to harass the dog at all, only that the dog should have a safe place away from the baby.  Any place in the dogs home should be safe.  There should be no reason a parent is allowing a baby to harass a dog, even a family dog.  Every dog has its limits."
"""practise talking to girls without any ulterior motives""

This is honestly the best advice for talking to any girl or anyone to be honest. Even if you're looking for love, just go in looking for friendship first. You'll still be able to make meaningful connections and honestly being able to talk to a guy without him just obviously trying to butter me up to get into my pants are always the best conversations anyways. You're usually able to tell the difference between guys who just want to flirt with you and guys that actually want to get to know you as a person, and that makes all the difference (to me anyways). And besides, girls can be your friends as well! Not every interaction with a girl has to be romantic. I say focus on making friends first, the romance will come after, whether it be through being introduced to mutual friends or actually creating a romantic relationship through friendship. Either way, I think working on friendship skills/interactions are the way to go!"
"NO.  Please leave her alone.  She does not want to be your friend, in real life or on Facebook.  This is not fixable.  Please just leave her alone.  "
She would be my xgf. She doesn't care how you feel. She's lieing to your face and going to continue to so why bother
Agreed with everything but I don't like your phrasing. A parent who chooses/needs to put her child in daycare is still raising their own child. The decision to to stay at home or work or whatever is advanced fucking calculus sometimes and deciding to use daycare as supplemental child care  during does *not* mean the parents aren't raising their own kids. /rant 
"After reading the OP and all of your responses to people's comments, I'm left feeling like you spend way too much time reading this sub, and not enough time talking to your boyfriend and working through issues.  I think that you may be setting yourself up to make a huge mistake that you're going to regret.  Stop citing posts in this sub as reasons to break up with the bf.  Have a serious talk with him when he gets back and go from there."
"I had a friend who kept having her drinks stolen. She finally put up a note that said, ""One of these is a trap. Please ask if you want one."" Of course none were actually booby trapped, but her drinks stopped disappearing."
"Did I miss the part where he moons people, or is ""showed his butt"" some sort of odd expression?  

He was definitely an ass. Did this come out of nowhere, or is this not uncommon behaviour for him?  I'd be horrifically embarrassed by him and reconsidering the relationship."
[removed]
"Is being ""triggerred"" something you express you feel often? Or is it something he made up about you with regards to this particular situation?"
"Go to the police asap! This guy could have killed you, he didn't just assault you once, he kept going back for more. Dump and report his ass.

I know you love him but you're worth so much more than someone who is going to smash your head into the floor and choke you. And then call you a ""key stealing bitch"" the next morning. Please leave him and stay safe, OP. "
"If it's your horse, I would move it from where it is now and have it boarded/stabled somewhere else.  And it sounds like getting away from your mom is probably the best thing for you."
"Being serious, I would recommend getting a cat. When I'm having a shit day, coming home to those furry fuckers is awesome. 

When I'm working from home they chill with me in my office, they sleep on the bed with us at night.

The little one, will sleep under the covers between me n my fiancee with just his head popping out for the top of the covers.

Cats are great and a really good way to focus your attention away from the world if that's what you need."

"That's the thing - it's consistent. He's made comments many times like ""did you go outside at all today?"" or ""I think you need to get out of the house and get fresh air"" or ""come on it's Friday/Wednesday/whatever day, we should go to the bar""


It's to the point where I feel like... guilty or awkward being on the computer or staying at home because I feel judged. I mean, it's not normal to go out every single day right? It's normal to want to chill at home after work"
"For the life of me, I don't know why there are responses here that aren't, ""He's mentally ill, this is beyond Reddit's paygrade, he needs professional help."" He won't go out at night? He's peeing in cups? He thinks a *deadly weapon* will help him?! Jesus people, no.

OP, he has an untreated medical condition, and sooner or later it will pose a real physical danger to both of you, on top of making the relationship unreasonably dysfunctional. You can't give him what he needs. He has to see a doctor, and if he won't, or won't even acknowledge it as an issue, you need to leave. This is, again, *physically dangerous*, and you deserve to be safe."
"NO NO NO! Police, and do it as soon as you can. Trying to talk to him will BACKFIRE. He will not listen or understand you. 

The following link is an old post of mine, it's not the same situation by any means, but see what happens when a rational girl tries to talk to a guy who claimed to love her.  [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/3ut0cb/please_times_six_young_neighbor_of_my_friend/)

she did not report him to the police, and he is STILL harassing her. Be careful, /u/notrelationshipgoals. Go no contact with the guy, and do not mozy around waiting to report this. Do it as soon as you can. Do it now.

edit: formatting"
"Yeah, it'd be awesome when the guy walked up and killed op point blank. And maybe others afterward."
"It is considered an egregious breach of anonymity to tell people outside the meetings about people inside the meetings.

It is NOT OK."
"I don't know if letting his wife wait inside counts as ""starting shit"" but I got you. 

I'd do it again in a heartbeat. "
"I would really encourage you to examine your own beliefs regarding sexuality, because you seem to have a pretty warped view of it. 

Sex and sex acts aren't inherently disgusting. Safe, informed experimentation is very normal and healthy. I hope you aren't projecting this attitude towards your kids whenever the topic of sex comes up or there's sex on tv or something. That kind of attitude that sex is wrong or gross or dirty can be very, very damaging. "
"Your situation reminds me of a vignette from *The Screwtape Letters* by CS Lewis. In it, two devils are discussing a woman who is guilty of the sin of gluttony, but does not overindulge in the traditional sense. 

&gt;One of the great, achievements of the last hundred years has been to deaden the human conscience on that subject [of gluttony], so that by now you will hardly find a sermon preached or a conscience troubled about it in the whole length and breadth of Europe. This has largely been effected by concentrating all our efforts on gluttony of Delicacy, not gluttony of Excess. Your patient's mother, as I learn from the dossier and you might have learned from Glubose, is a good example. She would be astonished‚Äîone day, I hope, will be‚Äîto learn that her whole life is enslaved to this kind of sensuality, which is quite concealed from her by the fact that the quantities involved are small. But what do quantities matter, provided we can use a human belly and palate to produce querulousness, impatience, uncharitableness, and self-concern? Glubose has this old woman well in hand. She is a positive terror to hostesses and servants. She is always turning from what has been offered her to say with a demure little sign and a smile ‚ÄúOh please, please...all I want is a cup of tea, weak but not too weak, and the teeniest weeniest bit of really crisp toast‚Äù. You see? Because what she wants is smaller and less costly than what has been set before her, she never recognises as gluttony her determination to get what she wants, however troublesome it may be to others. At the very moment of indulging her appetite she believes that she is practising temperance. In a crowded restaurant she gives a little scream at the plate which some overworked waitress has set before her and says, ‚ÄúOh, that's far, far too much! Take it away and bring me about a quarter of it‚Äù. If challenged, she would say she was doing this to avoid waste; in reality she does it because the particular shade of delicacy to which we have enslaved her is offended by the sight of more food than she happens to want.

"
"&gt; And your marriage is in seriously deep shit.

No sugar coating it just straight up truth."
"Them being family makes it worse, not better."
"Holy shit, I never comment on threads like this but hear my story. I'm the child of a mother who paid for 5 houses while her emotionally/financially abusive and neglectful dad walked out year after year, and now when she's finally divorcing him AFTER it's too late to get child support for me and my siblings, he is walking away with half in assets and won't help pay for any of our education. 

My mom paid for 5 houses and paid to raise us three and send us to school which will total 200k or so. He paid nothing and walked away with half.

Don't be a shitty person to yourself. My mom was shitty to us for putting us in this situation. You wouldn't do it to kids, don't do it to yourself.

According to the law you have 77k and he has 77k.

I repeat. Don't screw yourself over. Take the advice this sub is giving you."
"You're already aware of why this is a bad idea.  You've outlined it very clearly in your post, so I won't reiterate it much.  Are you sure you can't make up your mind or are you hoping there will be validation for you to go for it?  Getting involved with anyone from work is a horrid idea, let alone someone older, in a position of seniority beyond your rank (even if your rank is temporary), and with a reputation.  


I also come from a business that is dominated by men and the women that make it in the higher ranks are few and far between.  Aside from the reasons it would be a bad choice, reflect on this:  You also set a precedent for other young female interns after you (do you want those people to think it is appropriate to be in a position of authority over people and do that?).  Do also remember business connections.  People do talk, people do dealings, and even in my field, everyone knows everyone (even across the country).  Do you want to be known for your ability or the fact that you slept with someone from work before you jumped ship?  Because it can (and will) be looked at in the most unfavorable and unflattering way, even if it did not happen that way.  


For real though, don't do it.  Find someone outside of work (bonus: won't create a conflict of interests), even if you don't mean long-term.  It is way less messy."

"&gt; he's made several trips back to my dorm to meet up with his (and coincidentally my) friends. The first time was unannounced, and I put a stop to that. The second time, he came over for an event on campus with some other alumni friends and once again stopped by my dorm unannounced.

"I really feel sorry for your friend.  He's happy in a relationship and suddenly his friend's wife declares her love for him, then his friend calls about it, then there's a sit down meeting about her obsession with him.  No wonder he's taking a break.  I have a feeling it will be a long break, especially if your wife is around.

It's completely inappropriate behavior on her part, but her needs must be met, so she declares her love for him. Do you see how self centered this behavior is? I promise you that if he expressed even a bit of interest she would have left you without hesitation.

Both of you are 50% at fault here.  Both of you should be in individual therapy and couples counseling."

Yes and I wasted 3 of my prime dating years only to find out now he's not attracted to my body type when nothing significant has changed from Day 1. WTH. All my friends are engaged/married etc and here I am potentially single at age 28. Grrr. But better to have dodged a bullet in the long run.

"So the sent from my iPhone is an automated caption that comes up when you send emails from an iphone, meaning he has sent it from his phones email to his email. So it's likely it was something he received via text and then emailed himself from his phone. I mean if he was receiving a pic from a guy mate (like a porn star or something) it would have likely been a full nude so the fact he wanted to save a pic of a girl revealing underwear is a little sus. Do with this info what you will but if it was nothing, you will have proven to him your trust isn't quite there. To me it sounds dodge and I'd confront but I'd also be willing to address that i was wrong for snooping..

Also don't play it off as a curious cat, you can be on a partners device without going through his things. So thats probably something you should sort out internally as to why you felt that need."

But from your post it sounds like you're caring way too much about what random strangers think. Who cares if people are looking at her? It's not like you're in an office environment or something. That said, I definitely don't think you're obligated to hang out with her, and it was probably a little much of Leah to ask you to do that to begin with. Claire is Leah's sister, not yours, and Leah should be the one making time to show her around. Moving forward I would apologize to Leah for the perceived insult towards her sister. You can truthfully tell her you didn't mean to upset her. In terms of getting out of mandatory Claire time, just tell Leah that your class schedule is picking up and you can't really make time anymore. Again, she's Leah's sister and Leah was asking a lot by expecting you to see her so frequently. "
"&gt; The more I think about it more things start to fall into place. How am I to react at this point? This seems like a nightmare.

Edit: Also, you seem to have no clue what the phrase ""I don't have any problems with..."" or ""I have nothing against..."" means.  You can't follow it up with ""but I'd never marry one"".  It's like saying ""I don't have any problem with peas, but I'd never eat any"".  If you won't eat peas, then *that's you have a problem with peas*.  The problem is you don't like them and won't eat them.  You obviously have a problem with strippers; you don't think they're suitable romantic partners.  Chanting ""I don't have anything against strippers"" just makes you look confused.

Also, you make a big deal about how she been ""lying the entire relationship"", but you don't actually mention any times she actually lied.  Did you actually ask her ""hey, did you use to be a stripper""?"

No, I'm not saying that a 40yo woman cannot be attracted to a younger man...I'm saying in this instance it's pretty obvious she wanted to cut your hair and be done.  For your friends, male and female, to think it would have been a great idea to try to nail her at that time is pretty ridiculous.

If I were you, I definitely wouldn't allow your nephew to babysit your children ever again. He is obviously far too immature and has far too little impulse control to adequately handle the job. What's more, he didn't give a shit that he was basically spitting in your face by fucking someone (on your kid's bed, no less!) while you paid him handsomely to take care of your children.

"I dont want to give away any details but it has to do with a certain type of aircraft.  He would make more in the long run than I could.  We did discuss it when he was in school that his career would come first based on that.  I just didn't think it would lead us here because i thought surely the city we live in now would have something, but they all want experience.  I'm getting a little suspicious that he didn't try all that hard for other, more desirable places, and he probably did have his heart set on this one once he found it.  The other options were in way too expensive cities and he would have had to just rent a room and the baby and I stay here.

She's embarrassed, ashamed, scared, and feels like her life is out of her own control. So, yes, you are totally in the right to feel unattracted to her and honestly hurt by her behavior.

However, if you really want to fix things, it's time to go into caretaker mode.

Sit her down and talk sympathetically about her behavior. Try to understand that she feels lost and alone. She doesn't miss the looks people (especially you) give her for her weight. She thinks she's losing you.

If you're willing, tell her that you're okay with taking over the reins for a while. That means making her meals and taking over diet planning for her, maybe even scheduling her personal trainer appointments. Remind her that her body is beautiful and sacred and it hurts you to see her hurt. Phrase it as close to ""I love you and I want you to get back to loving yourself"" as you can get. She's stressed, unhappy, and *scared*.

I struggled with an eating disorder for years while my parents sat back and got frustrated. Frustration is understandable to a point, but it doesn't help the person you love. I would have given anything for someone to just take over my diet and let me stop thinking about my body for five minutes. I'd bet your wife is in the same boat."
"1.) The next time Boss says anything about dating his daughter, say as calmly and politely as you can: ""Sir, I'm here to work. I like this job and I like the work. I'm not interested in dating your daughter, and I'm not comfortable discussing my personal life with my boss on the job. I like to keep my work life and my dating life separate. Please don't bring that subject up again at work. Thank you."" 

Make a note of when you said it. 

The next time it comes up when you're working, after you're done working, write your boss an email saying the exact same thing. Keep a copy of that email. 

I'm going to assume this is a small company with no HR department, and that your boss either owns the company or is in close with the owners, which means you don't have anyone else to go to. Which means you just pick a script, and repeat it as often as needed. Every single time he mentions his daughter, in the most bored-but-polite voice you can, say one of the following:

""Sir, I keep my social life separate from my work.""
""Sir, it doesn't seem appropriate for me to discuss my romantic choices with my boss. I'd rather not talk about it.""
""Sir, I understand this is important to you, but I've already told you my opinions on the subject.""

Also, **tell your girlfriend** about this situation. Tell her you are trying to be as professional as you can, and keeping things polite, respectful, and cordial at work, but that you did not ask for this woman to pursue you and you have zero interest in dating her. Tell her you've told the daughter this, tell her you've told your boss this, and tell her you've put it in writing to your boss. "
"&gt; safe enough

The thing is that if anything goes south with either of them after work or on the weekends, that could still affect your job. But, I get what you're saying. The chances of that happening are probably pretty low, but the chances that the relationship doesn't work out with his daughter are pretty high. Your next post would be ""I dated my boss's daughter for a few months, we broke up last week, and now she's pregnant. Halp!"""
It's like I stumbled into a factory that manufactures red flags.
"Are you Chinese-American? I don't think you should teach him how he ought to feel about being Chinese-American or looking Chinese. You sound like you are being insensitive. Calling him racist is definitely out of line. Telling him he acted like a Chinese tourist because he wanted to argue in the cab is also uncalled for. He's just trying to share his feelings with you. Instead of invalidating them, try to be understanding. Accept his feelings and his experience that he's willing to share with you. You'll be a more informed individual for it."
"**DESTROY THE NOTE NOW, DON'T TELL ANYONE NEW AND MAKE SURE EVERYONE WHO KNOWS STFU**

Your father was a monster and this is his last attempt to hurt your brother. Maybe he won't care, but maybe the guilt could hurt your brother for a life and drive him to his own grave. There is no upside to telling him an potentially disastrous downside. I have seen so many people tie themselves in note for decades for stuff that was much less their fault than this.

Your brother can go to the funeral but strongly encourage him not to. Encourage him to forget he ever had a dad. Same for you."

"&gt;she shares stuff on his Facebook page all the time. I brought this up with him and he says he does too. Because she has the same last name as him I'm afraid people will think they're married.

&gt;do they actually have an inappropriately close relationship or am I imagining things?

Please dial it back. You're not batsh!t yet but on the verge. You are imagining things.

"If this uncle is someone his own parents don't want to speak to, and that might lose his kids to the courts... it might be safe for you to assume he's an abuser. Your mom might refuse to speak to him as a way to protect herself/ you. She may still be debating with your dad on the nephew front, hence why not replying. Taking in your uncles kids would have him access to your lives in a way your mom might be uncomfortable with.

As to the hypocrite thing, there is a difference between skipping out on family stuff because it's lame, and trying to avoid a family member that is a potential danger. "
"I have the same issue with making friends, some ideas...

- Join a sport! Or a few sports! In the last few years I took up bowling, softball and volleyball. I've met so many people through those. 

- Take a class - like cooking or sewing or something you like

- Do you have a dog? Are there any dog parks around? Go take it there! I've met some really nice people at my local dog park. 

- Every time someone invites you somewhere, go. You never know who you'll meet. "
"Yeah to me the only thing I could think of were those childish Facebook posts where people talk about ""keep me away from a pet store otherwise I'll come home with an animal"" and fake YouTube couples arguing over them bringing home pets. I see many people comment that it's something they'd ""totally do."" I'm also 19 and friends with high schoolers. I think you can probably guess where I'm going with this- he's immature.

I'd take the advice of the other posters about his disrespect and lack of consideration for your feelings and wishes but additionally I would definitely add in how neglectful it is that he went on a 5 day business trip and how he was irresponsible. That's like buying a dog then leaving them at home for five days day with zero instructions hoping that someone will step up. He literally just neglected those poor smelly ferrets. Hopefully he feels bad and understands what he did was wrong. 

Sorry you're having to literally be like his mother rather than his wife in this. Hope all goes well."

It's definitely a legal one and I wouldn't bother with /legaladvice, find yourself a proper lawyer right away and figure out how to untangle things. You might lose the house and gain your sanity (there are lots of dream houses, don't worry about that).   
And yes, those first two lawyers were idiots. I bought my house with my girlfriend at the time. We had an agreement written up on what would happen if things didn't work out. That went away when we got married but it's not that complicated."

"Oh hi, are you dating my ex? My ex left my graduation early to watch a sports game (not even live, on TV). We went to an awards ceremony where I was nominated and he insisted we sit right right at the back near the exit so that he could slip out before the end to watch the F1; I won the award and had to walk the furthest possible distance (in heels!) to collect it. He did not come to the afterparty celebrating me and the other award winners. Because, like your boyfriend, the sports ""made more sense"" to him. 

Here's the mistake I made. I never told him how hurt and offended I was about his prioritisation of sports until I broke up with him (for other, more egregious reasons - though the events above did not help). You need to tell your boyfriend how you feel. You can bring it up in a non-accusatory way for sure, but the fact is that he said he would go to the baby shower and it is rude to bail on family events for something more fun. His rationalisation that ""it makes more sense"" for him to go to the sports is bullshit, sorry. He just wants to go to the sports more - and that's fine! We'd all rather do a fun hobby than go to a baby shower! But being an adult and being a partner involve doing the things you said you'd do, and supporting your partner - whether that's going to a family event you've already committed to, or staying at their entire boring graduation."
"She's an adult who sounds perfectly capable of taking care of herself. You're fine OP. If you wanna casually bang the physically out of your league guy til he finds someone he likes more, go for it. Just because this person couldnt handle being told they're being replaced eventually doesn't mean you cant enjoy the ride for what it's worth."
"As an unpregnant person, what's OP's excuse for being so abrasive, dismissive and emotionally obtuse? He's interested in giving both his kids *both* his names but when it comes to his wife's name ""it's just a name what's the big deal"" (an argument that could easily be used against his position)."

So when it comes to certain things I have a hard time applying what I know to how I feel. I'll explain. 

She's still great friends with two of her ex's. One of which she hangs out with regularly and the other she converses with almost daily. The second guy also happens to be who she turns to when we get into an argument since they're so close. Now I know she'd never cheat on me but I can't help but feel intimidated. I know full well that it stems from insecurities and that as a man I'm socialized to be possessive and competitive. But sometimes I can't help it. This has caused a lot of grief and turmoil because I know I have nothing to fear, but the fear remains. 

So we agreed that the space may help me calm down and be less paranoid and possessive, and it'll give me time to consciously work on my own insecurities while causing less strain and damage to the relationship. "

Yeah, draw your own conclusions.  I'm not one for generous benefit of the doubt like many on this sub.  Seeing how people are in today's society, unless your judgement is clouded by your own insecurity and seeing things where they aren't, when in doubt, they fucked. "
"The OP can make whatever rules they want. Doesn't mean 7 weeks in kid jail for smoking weed isn't an idiotic rule.   
What a 14 year old who's using drugs (including alcohol) needs is help from his family, not punishment. The parents should be worried about him, not angry at him."
Oh you should also tell the gfs parents she was smoking weed. This will amplify the punishment. 
He's pretty upset with his sister.  He gave her and her husband a stern lecture but I wasn't around to hear it.  My nephew (who is niece's older brother) was helping me bring things out to the car at the time.
My gf and I talk to each other like this all the time and she doesn't seem to mind. 
"It sounds like  you and your wife are on different pages of what constitutes happiness and what are priorities in a budget. These are things you need to discuss together to come to a common ground. And if you can't do it together, then perhaps in the presence of a neutral third party like a marriage counselor. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to put away some money for a vacation once a year with the kids and maybe a four-day weekend with just you and the wife (assuming you have family that would be OK watching the kids). 

But the thing you really have to do is stop measuring your happiness against what other people have, particularly your brother. Your lives are different and you'll never be able to have the same luxuries if for no other reason than because you have two kids. That's half a million right there you'll be spending up until they're 18, according to estimates. Then add in college tuition. "
"I'm sort of getting the vibe that she actually buys into their line of thinking a little bit. It's how she was raised you know, I'm sure some of it has seeped in subconsciously"
"Echoing what other people have said, you guys are basically the same age. Don't let anyone make you feel weird about an age gap that small. "
"I was so annoyed by the ""Asian way is always right"" mantra. I know he says he won't raise his kids like that, but if you're fighting about that now, when you don't have kids, I can only imagine what it will be like when you do. You'll say no to some parenting method; he'll say ""this is how I was raised,"" and you'll never hear the end of it. I do not trust that he won't resort to this rhetoric every time you two have an argument. And to apply it to a dog, which, while smart, is not able to understand him, is ridiculous. The dog doesn't know any better. He did nothing wrong. Your SO, on the other hand, committed a horrific offense. In all his time seeing you interact with the dog and seeing the dog ""misbehave"" (even mildly), I bet he also noticed that not ONCE did you imprison the dog for bad behavior. You corrected it, is my guess. So he would know that you wouldn't be ok with his punishment, which is why he didn't outright tell you.

TL;DR: I would dump him. "
"That happened to a great friend of mine, several years ago. In a nice, peaceful town. I pulled up outside his house and it's a damn stroke of luck I didn't run him over in the dark.. He was lying on the ground in the street behind another vehicle right by where I parallel parked. None of us saw him until we got out, and everyone but me walked right by him. His face was completely black and swollen and he was completely incoherent, just light moaning. We got him to the hospital where they discovered every bone in his face was fractured. Completely random, utterly and horrifyingly violent. "

"This is a really important point.

You're right: not teaching the crucial skill of respecting animals can result in the dog developing a fear of children. "

"You aren't happy, that's the most justifiable reason ever.  She seems like to type to play games, so don't feed into her thing, just tell her it's not working and end it.  Don't get into how you feel, or that you aren't sure what's up with her because it's all part of her drama game.  "

Sounds like op would do well to look into personal therapy as well as some sort of speaking class. I had a friend who was very prickly to others due to bullying. She went to some anger management and a group therapy as well as improv classes. It really helped her learn to both empathize as well as communicate better.
"I think you are being too harsh on Lana, her behaviour wasnt great, but understandable. She was nervous, may have believed that there was a past sexual relationship with josie and was anxious/insecure and wanted to scout it out. She was already the odd one out, taking her somewhere that literally marked her as such was thoughtless. Havnt we all gotten a bit too drunk sometimes? If i got banned from friends everytime i did, i dont think i would have any left. She probably knows she wasnt great, pushing her to admit it will probably just make the next time even harder.

Josie overreacted, we all understand where she is coming from. Apologise for Lana, let time cool it and im sure she will give lana a 2nd chance when you push for it in a while.

I think you have a lot to learn from this. Dont be such a doormat, turning up to someones house hours early is very rude. You didnt want to cause an argument? A simple ""i know Josie wont like it if we are early, lets hang out in a AC'd cafe for a while"". If that causes a problem, your relationship has much bigger issues. You could have been much more thoughtful and helped Lana fit in better. For future relationships, weekend intros are a lot, think day trips and cafes, not bars. If you do a weekend, you need your own place to stay and things to do alone when/if it gets awkward. Introducing SOs to family and close friends should be done with great care and thought. The first impressions can last a life time, its better to learn this lesson now at 22.

I think it was unkind for Leah to go there, but if this is OP presenting his wife in a neutral/slightly positive light (note all the excuses for her bad behaviour) then I'm totally willing to believe Grandpa couldn't stand the ill-behaviour of his grandson's wife. No wonder he cried off the wedding.

It's Oliver I feel sorry for. Leah is clearly educated and with her shit together, she'll be alright. But that poor little kid is being kept from things he likes, and has dreadful examples in his parents. He'll be taught to be an unhealthy, uneducated, spiteful little shit because he's got a mum who won't let him play sport, who makes fun of people in higher education, and who is routinely horrible to family members... and a dad who sits by and lets it all happen.

My BIL is Downs and whenever anyone talks about him they're always like ""oh he's so loving and cheerful and happy!"" because that's the stereotype of people with Downs. Actually my BIL is a real grump most of the time and to describe him as ""cheerful and happy"" is totally ignoring the fact that he's an individual with his own personality. So when you say ""they"" are ""hard-working and caring and always give their all"" you're doing the same thing and it's really frustrating as it reduces someone to their disability rather than allowing them to be an individual."

Source: I am a mother. The father of my daughter has only given me ~$200 since we split ... a decade ago. Even that was just ""what he could do"" not an amount set by a court. I'm sure he'd be on the hook for some piddling amount, but the fact is that he's underemployed and I don't need his money.

"I have smaller sized boobs and I'm much more comfortable in a sports bra, too. I can't stand the feeling of being without one at night, to the point that I actually can't sleep. 

Interestingly, my husband has never once questioned it. "
"""I hope you become comfortable in your body. By the way you've described your body, it's perfectly logical to have a complex about it! Maybe consider having invasive surgery to change it!""

Are you for real? With this attitude, it's no wonder that you expect all large-busted women to be insecure basket cases. 
"
We can't really give any kind of advice without knowing what she lied about.  
"Move on. Find a guy who loves you for you and loves your boobs too!
I have very small boobs too and I've never had a problem finding a guy. My boyfriend loves my boobs the way they are and I do too! When I was younger I thought I wanted a boob job but now I realise how amazing it is to have small boobs, they don't hurt when you run or go to the gym, you can sleep/sunbathe on your front, they never get in the way, and you get attention for the right reasons, guys talk to your face! :)"
Listen to your gut. It's right.
"I wish he would voice those feelings/stereotypes and then decide if they apply to his wife. Her lying by omission is the biggest true ethical issue, as far as I can see, but the stripping is getting all the attention. Like, I feel like some people would be more OK with their wife having been a fucking contract killer than having been a stripper. and I don't get that. "
"Confront her. She probably doesn't mean the love thing. 
But the unprotected sex this is fucked up. Some women get off in that, being dirtier with a stranger than with a husband. You need to talk to her and make her get her head straight. She cheated, you have proof. I hope you saved it, because if divorce comes up then that can really save you a lot in the long run "
"&gt;He told me he wouldn't live with a freeloader.   
 
Not boyfriend material.   
There was a time when my boyfriend and I were living together that he lost his job (no fault of his own). I carried all the bills until he got employed again, and then he turned around and carried them all for the same number of months. Because partners support each other. "
"Deciding that you personally wouldn't have an abortion doesn't make you pro-life. Trying to decide that someone else shouldn't have an abortion makes you pro-life.

You've decided that you wouldn't have one and that it's none of your business if someone else has one. You're pro-choice. You've made your choice and think that other people should have the right to make their choice, even if it's not the one you made."
"That seems to be a free pass for people to make jokes at other people's expense though. As an adult you should know that you are responsible for the words that come out of your mouth. 

And other people feeling hurt because of your joke is not abuse, it's just being human and you know having actual emotions. "
"Well, no, it's pretty irritating that she said she didn't want a gift, he makes a big deal insisting on it, and wraps it up and brings it to her during the day, putting her in the position of being expected to enthusiastically thank him for the one thing she explicitly asked him not to do.  "
Exactly. I doubt she'd like the answer even if she wasn't pregnant. So don't blame on her hormone. 
"Unfortunately I think deleting and starting over again when he's ready will be the best option for his mental health. Ex: He deactivates now with a mailbox full of hateful messages, when he reactivates those messages will still be there."

"Your children will get fun of something, no matter what.  Whether it is their surname, a character on TV with their first name, their face, their glasses, how tall/small they are, the clothes they are wearing, when they did something, the food they had for lunch.  You cannot protect them from everything that will happen.  She made it clear before she wants to keep her name.

If you force this you will cause so much resentment, you risk losing her.  Extrapolate that and they end up with only her name."
"WOW. The way you acted about this made me physically recoil from my phone. Ugh. Insulting her then trying to hug her. Trying to pull her onto your lap when she's obviously mad since you hurt her feelings. Ugh. Gross. Stop it.

You basically stampeded over her. You took a giant shit all over her and her name. Good job, dude."
"Instead of worrying about finding a proper deposit for a proper apartment, I'd explore short-term options that you can deal with day-to-day or week-to-week.  Airbnb, Craigslist, couchsurfing.  Anything to get the hell out of that house.  The cats will likely be the biggest hurdle here--maybe he would agree to look after them for a short period of time and allow you to drop by to take care of them until you find a more permanent situation for living?  For example: ""I am ending this relationship and will be out of your hair financially and otherwise starting immediately; please allow the cats to stay for their comfort and safety for [set period of time--one month?] while I find another place to live permanently.""  idk man.  This is rough.  It's an option.  I also know a few people who have lived semi-permanently in their cars with pets. . .it's not ideal but it might work for a few weeks while you save a small amount of money up.

Go for broke. Leave.  He sucks and you're lovely.  Hope you get to do something nice for yourself soon."
"Honestly? He probably doesn't even realize how he's coming off and isn't even thinking about your feelings either. When a close family member - especially a parent - is dying, you're going to experience a bevy of emotions and reactions. His right now seems to be frustration and shutting you out. 

I would simply either say ""I'm here for you, and if you want me to come up I will come up in a heartbeat"" or simply tell him ""I'm coming up to help on XYZ day"". Don't dig for approval - he's simply not in a place to do that it sounds like. 

Give him a break, and hopefully once things calm down he'll turn back to decent and appreciative. "
Because she's pregnant and the father of the baby is an asshole who just wants her to leave. 
"The comments must have been pretty bad if they resulted in probation. Regardless, you witnessed the comments, you've surely told your bf what the comments were, verbatim, and now he's telling you on no uncertain terms that he thinks that behavior is okay. When people show you who they are, believe them. (Cliche but true.)"
"Not telling your girlfriend of four years about getting in touch with an old friend is pretty weird.  I've gotten in touch with several old friends over the years and I always tell my husband about it, because I'm excited!  But if your boyfriend is forgetful, maybe it doesn't actually mean anything.

Texting them constantly during their date is pretty fishy though.  I've had friends who I considered my brothers and I'd never in a million years have texted them during a date, despite being protective of them, and they never would have texted me.  I could hear the details after the date, like a normal person.  It sounds to me like your bf was trying to disrupt their date.

I don't think your feelings are irrational.  So tell him!  Stick to feelings, not accusations.  ""When you texted Elizabeth during her date, it made me feel ___.""  That type of thing.  See what he has to say."
"She's insecure and probably thinks she uninteresting / uncool. Just do the yoga and stay aloof from her mocking. If you want to then you could have a conversation with her where you tell her all the things that you find interesting and cool, followed by saying you know she doesn't actually know anything about the stuff she falsely claims to like and that's totally ok. "
"Not so much a red flag.  More like a fireworks show. 

Every person deserves to have skills that lead to employability. His position suggests that he considers you less than him.

"A douche is a device used to introduce a stream of water into the body for medical or hygienic reasons, or the stream of water itself. Douche usually refers to vaginal irrigation, the rinsing of the vagina, but it can also refer to the rinsing of any body cavity.

Edit: I had no idea how to approach this so I just gave a definition I found. Languages are weird, I never found it odd for ""corny"" and ""cheesy"" to be odd until I lived abroad."
You can wait until you're an adult and then do all of the adult things your heart desires. 
"Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't her intention but that came across as very narcissistic. 

""Now that my boyfriend has more autonomy and confidence I'm worried that I have less control over our relationship.""

Oof "
"The language OP says he uses (saying he never thought she would be crazy and jealous, etc) also suggests he is setting her up for him to gaslight later."
"OP said that there was only blood on the floor once. I agree that a behaviorist would be a good option, or talking to their vet. But we don't need to immediately insist that they rehome one of the cats and tell them they are bad cat owners. "
"If the relationship won't survive waiting, then yay OP dodged a divorce. If relationship survives waiting, congrats all around and OP can probably get future FIL's blessing. "
"First off, a disclaimer: I don't know you and I think your partner should call you what makes you feel comfortable. With that said:

You may want to consider the distinction between bi*sexual* and bi*romantic*. It seems from your description that you fit into the category of bisexual, but that you don't fit into the category of biromantic. If you are *sexually* attracted to men and women then you are bisexual, but I think you are angry at your partner because from your perspective he is accusing you of being *romantically* attracted to women, which you make clear that you are not."
"I'm not convinced this is worth salvaging. This man has been showing these behaviors from the start of their relationship. He's not likely to change at this point, is he? "
Men like that play emotional chicken with their victims. They absolutely *count* on their victims not being willing to push harder than they do.
Perfect example of Causation vs. Correlation. There are so many people that don't understand it. 
"If she's very religious and home schooled and 18 years old, I'm guessing she doesn't have a ton of life experience yet and is absolutely not ""wise beyond her years."" I would leave her alone and not try to pursue her. "

"I suppose there's nothing wrong with researching this particular industry, it might be rather interesting compared to more ordinary types of businesses.  And in many respects, it probably is an ordinary business with accountants and manufacturers and so forth.


But asking you to wear (surprisingly *specific*) BDSM gear for a presentation is out of line.  If anything the point should be exactly the above -- most of the components and structure and concerns of a business are the same regardless.    This isn't a matter of you ""not liking"" the assignment -- that would be if she asked you to research agriculture but you're more interested in high tech.  This is a matter of the instructions being deliberately humiliating, offensive and inappropriate for the educational setting.

"Girls are much too sweet to say those things, that came from other guy friends. Not great things to say, I know it and I'm sure they do too, but it's passed. 

Girls are great so long as you're not actively creepy. I don't go for the more... scandalous women lol. I know what they want and I know I don't have it. That being said, there ARE plenty of girls who do like nice guys, I'm proof of that much!"
Invite him to play poker ASAP.
Thank you. Personal space is very important. It's hard not to call or text when I s all I'm thinking about though.
"Oh honey. This girl you've been dating casually for six months is trying to emotionally blackmail you into impregnating her. If you break up now, she will be pregnant to someone else in six months. Neither of you are ready for children, I promise you that.

 I could write a big long thing about how she's clearly not mature enough for motherhood and how she will likely be a complete pain in the ass to deal with when you shockingly break up around the kids first birthday and have to deal with custody disputes but if you have any sense in you at all, you will know all this already. 

Run for your god damn life and don't look back. "
Definitely the best response in this thread. I hope u/koolmoe_D sees it. 
The way you describe your girlfriend's reactions does not sound like she's lying. She sounds honestly flabbergasted by the whole situation and he sounds like a crazy nutjob who's desperate to break you up. She should talk to the management of the bar about getting him banned or maybe think about getting another job.
"And did your daughter ask about your neighbors? Or did your wife out of the blue mention neighbors (that Colleen hasn't lived next to since high school) that just so happen to be pregnant right after arguing with her daughter over grandchildren?

I have to agree with everyone else, you're missing a big part of this story. Colleen has decided not to have children, that is her decision to make and her's alone. From what Collen sent to your wife it is very clear to me that your wife has been pestering and nagging Colleen about grandchildren for some time now. Your wife also refused to accept Colleen's reasons for not having kids, reasons that your daughter did not have to give out. You are not entitled to knowing the reasons that Colleen has for being child free and they are definitely not open for debate. If you don't think her reasons are acceptable keep it to yourself because she isn't going to pop out babies just because you think her reasons are selfish and because you and your wife want grandkids.

Your wife is aggravating the situation and baiting your daughter to start a fight. Since you mentioned that Colleen and your wife had screaming matches during Colleen's teenage years I suspect this dynamic has gone on for sometime and your daughter moved away to escape it. What you are seeing here in the text message is not your daughter being a bitch for no reason. This is your daughter losing her patience and enforcing a boundary that your wife was most likely informed and reminded of multiple times.

From what I can see here Colleen has been far kinder than I would have been. She responded politely and explained her reasoning even after your wife insulted her to her face. Your daughter was kind and polite and considerate of her mother's feelings up until your wife pushed her to far by trying to manipulate her with passive aggressive bullshit. You are so blinded thinking about your ""rebellious teenage"" daughter being ""mean"" to your wife that you are going to lose your adult daughter forever.

You and your wife are acting as if Collen owes you grandchildren because you had her. That's not at all how it works. If you and your wife want grandchildren that badly you should have had more than one kid. As it stands if you and your wife don't shape the fuck up and start treating your daughter as the mature, responsible adult that she is and start seeing her as an equal not lesser than she is going to go no contact with you and once that door shuts it is incredibly hard to open it again and have a relationship with your daughter"
"I really don't think she knows. I think she suspects him, maybe, but I doubt she'd let him touch her if she knew for sure he was cheating. 

Also it annoys me how sloppy he is with it. He could at least have turned his phone off before walking through the door and gone to a different restaurant or even made up a better excuse for coming home late. Something that wouldn't leave her worried sick half the night. 

My teenaged ex boyfriend was better at covering his tracks than my dad. "
"&gt;After typing this whole thing, we talked again about it after joking around about it for a bit. He grabbed my boob in the car jokingly and I went to push his arm again and he goes ""SEE!! You were going to slap me!"" and I said ""I told you NO. NO IS NO. You can't just touch my boobs whenever you want if I don't want you to."" **He said ""so what, you want me to ASK you every time? That's so dumb. I'm not going to be like 'can i squeeze your boob' what's the point in being in a relationship if I can't squeeze your boobs whenever I want?""** I proceeded to violently squeeze his breasts and asked how he liked it. He goes ""so?"" Well I'm sure it'd be a lot more bothersome if I did it all the time. Besides, at this point now its about the fact that I told him no and he's just testing me my limits. **Sometimes it actually hurts when he squeezes them.**

He's a rapey sounding jerk. 

Grabbing you against your stated NO and hurting you is legally sexual assault. "
"I also think it's a good idea to take it to the superior to find out what's going on. If this other manager is on the same level, chances are that it's a mind fuck to make you uncomfortable about your performance in hopes you'll screw up.

ETA: I don't mean you should tattle on the other manager, but rather get behind it before it turns into your career being damaged by unfounded rumors."
Thank god yo are seeing some sense.. His fetish is taking over his life and your life
"My parents told me Denmark was dangerous, no explanation. I live in NYC...."
"Yes, it is.  If she goes directly to her husband, the in-laws will wonder why she didn't tell them first.  She needs to say what she doesn't like and if they don't listen, then ask her husband to do it.

How is this hard?  She didn't say anything about telling her husband to help or even telling her husband that she doesn't like it.  I have a 1 year old and guess what, my wife and I have different ideas of what is acceptable until we talk about it."
"Also, new moms have enough to do to take care of a kid (for better or worse, physically moms have more on their plates than dads early on), and she probably doesn't need more foisted upon her. This is one job he can handle to give her a slightly easier time. "
"&gt;I feel like I would be rubbing it in my siblings faces that our dad loves Callie and I but not them.

Your dad sounds like he just hasn't burned his bridges with you and Callie yet.

"/u/MORTAUALUNA DOWN!

"Put up curtains.  Do not answer her texts.  If she comes to your door knocking and won't go away, call the police.

Time to stop being nice and gentle about this.  You have to make a clean break with her and stick to it.  Tell her that if she continues to contact you, you will contact the authorities.  You have to stop being nice."
"That's... not even suspicious. Apparently you just want it to be suspicious.

Advice: Keep your day job. You're not quite a Holmes-level PI."
"Yep, this is what I thought too."
"But she wasn't saying that. She was saying that they think you should have children simply because it's in your genes, ignoring the fact that it's also a lifestyle choice. The point is that those people think that having children is inevitable, and those are the arguments they use, while ignoring that choosing not to have children is valid.

I do think the genetics/reproductive drive thing is hilarious because there are so many things that our lizard brains do that we push down because society has evolved. People love to fall back on ""but you have to because biology!"" when it suits them, but are more than willing to literally rewire their brain to effectively use technology."
"You can't go out with her Saturday night?

Let her have her social life on Fridays and create other opportunities for the two of you to spend time together doing something fun.

BTW, she is not excluding you. You have the option to join her, but are choosing not go take it."
"You cheated, ""not almost"". I feel bad for you boyfriend, just tell him.. Either way he's going to find out someday."
"Does she need to drop this activity to prove she loves you?

I mean, if you want to plan a weekend together, or have a specific show/activity in mind that has to be Friday, then yeah there should be some compromise. But arbitrarily demanding she sacrifice the one night a week she is doing her own thing seem really spiteful of you."
It's hard to use your words when he's forcibly covering your mouth with his.
"Hell yes. OP, dump this asshole with a quickness.

If y'all don't live together then ghost him. Straight up no contact He's an abusive turd."
Because it's not his body and he doesn't get to dictate how her body looks. 
"Their age of consent is 12, but your dad is still a pedo creep that all of you should cut off to infinity."
"Thing is, he SHOULD have got the point from you trying to pull away initially, or at most when you pushed his chest."
"That's what I was thinking. The worst mistake Crystal made was not sabotaging the friendship, but rather not realizing that she shouldn't HAVE to sabotage the friendship. That her husband should be so concerned about her happiness that he could set boundaries himself. Like you know not cuddling and maintaining an intense emotional relationship with his ""friend"" while he's supposed to be with HER. I think if she'd left him a long time ago they'd both be happier today. I feel very sorry for her."
"&gt;But is she really a good person if still, after all this time, she has no remorse for what she did?

I gotta be honest- I'm *very* against lying in relationships, but I feel while OP's wife did lie about whether or not OP knew what was going on at the time (which is pretty not good),

&gt;...that going away for a few days with a woman who obviously had feelings for me would have put an undue strain on my relationship with Crystal. I didn‚Äôt want to tell her, apparently, so Crystal agreed to break the news. She told Lucy that I wanted her to stay away for six months, and after that we could see about rekindling our friendship

 it doesn't sound like she said ""Fuck off, never talk to him again!"" and that she instead asked for time to cool things off. 

It's still not *great*, but IMO, not *quite* as bad a ""My SO said fuck off forever and he hates you"" lie.

In this case, it *seems* like what OP's wife said to Lucy was true *except* for the part about OP agreeing to the cooling off period."
She's probably a real ghost now.
"As everyone else has said, block him everywhere and go to the police if necessary. Stay safe OP. "
"This is so true. My son is 12 weeks old...and I wish I didn't have to work. I miss being home with him all day. I never thought I'd want to be a stay at home mom...until I had to go back to work after he was born. Not to mention, the cost of daycare is insane. And with two babies...it'd be even more expensive."
"I wish that were true but I know for sure it was not a foreclosure when she bought it, and it has a set auction date listed (for later this year.)"

I'm confused about why he'd even want to bring his kid to the wedding. Having your child at a wedding is surely a lot of hassle.
"If not being an asshole if out of the question then I don't know what you expect. If you're unwilling to stop treating people poorly I don't see how you think you'll be able to get them to stop noticing they you're an asshole. Maybe if you ask nicely they'll stop bringing it up around you, but they'll still think it."
"Op, maybe there is something medically or psychologically wrong.
Everyone on r/relationships loovvveeesss to say ""break up!!"" But they aren't the ones who've been with this guy for 5 years. From what you've said, I'll *trust* that this is out of character for him. 

according to behaviorism, EVERY action/behavior has an explanation/reason. I would wait a couple of days to when he's in a good mood, and sit him down and say ""hey, my feelings were really hurt and I was very embarrassed at the wedding. We both are hardworking people and care about stepson very much. I feel like you acted out of character that day, could you help me understand why?""

It's important to phrase your words in a very non-blaming and supportive way, while still addressing the issue EVEN THOUGH HES IN THE WRONG. If you want him to tell you what's wrong with him then you need to make sure he knows that it's safe to tell you.

A doctor's visit is a good idea. Of course, if his behavior becomes increasingly abusive, you will need to break up with him. 

Also, try to make more time away from the kid, couples who don't focus on their selves enough aren't as fulfilled"
[deleted]
I'd say those around him failed him.
"It doesn't seem you have a counter plan to better the situation.

Just sit down with your wife to talk about boundaries and concerns. Get on the same page and then speak with MIL. 

You'll have to deal with ""not being head of the house"" because it isn't your house. However you and your wife can be firm with MIL's role as grandmother and not a co parent. 

Her house rules might be different like ""no shoes worn in the house"" or no food outside the kitchen, however rules like kid's bed time, meals eaten, and so on are still firmly made by you both. Grandma isn't allowed to under mind you- period. 

If your wife can't be on the same page with you on this- come up with a better plan than hers. "
"I agree. This is also not good:

&gt; I ask what's wrong, ignores me. I start prodding him ""hey. If you're pissed talk to me. Hey, I'm not letting you go to bed mad, hey, let's talk, hey, listen""

If someone needs space you give them space. 

That said, her poor communication strategy in no way justifies his heinous response. He needs to be arrested and charged. He's going to eventually kill someone. He was very close to killing the OP. "
"I think I may have an unpopular opinion on this.

I don't know much of the dynamics of your parents' relationship, but from the post can assume it was complicated. She wrote him off of her will, but he stayed around to help her in the end? 

That sounds like a lot for someone to take on. Is he seeing a therapist? Maybe rushing into a relationship was his way of coping, or maybe even that he actually loves this woman. The death of a spouse and the death of a parent are totally different experiences. 

That being said, you can be honest but you also don't have to respond to anything if you don't want to. Just do whatever it takes to overcome your grief as you also deserve to be happy."
"He must have just been grasping at straws to find some way he could say you were in the wrong in this situation so he could pretend to be the victim. This is an anonymous forum, it's not like any of us could find his nudes from this post! We have literally no clue who either of you actually are. I don't see how that even compares to the way he was treating you."
"Yep. OP, it's normal in relationships where both parties enthusiastically participate in that kind of play (does not apply here) and in abusive relationships (hmmm...) "
"As others have said, he's escalating.  Time to get out.  Now.  Before it gets any worse (and by worse I mean him doing you some real damage or actually killing you - choking is not something to take at all lightly - even people deep in the BDSM scene take it extremely seriously - especially when he's told you that he did it out of anger).

Also, don't drive when you're high."
"Normal people say ""sorry, I got mixed up"" and it's fine. 

Sounds like he's dating too many women, or doesn't actually listen to what you talk about, or isn't that into you, or a combination thereof. Then he argues with you when you correct him because he can't be wrong and makes it about something it's not to make it your fault. Yeah that's weird. One of those things might be ok but not the combination of several, that's not worth your time."

"NYU is the school we want to go to, we are going to go to a more affordable one if one of us can't get in. I should have worded it better 

NYU is the ideal school to go to, but it's not set in stone or anything. She may not even be able to go because our parents don't save up that much money for college. NYU is ideal but it does not have to be, we live in New York so somewhere around here.

"This may not be what is happening with your gf at all, but I would like to share my experience with this. 
Years back, I went to Uni and I had a boyfriend of 2 years. Within the first month of uni, I lost interest in him. He hadn't done anything wrong at all, but it was such a new experience for me, I just felt like I wanted to start fresh and experience it all without having to explain it all to him every night and feel guilty if I didn't invite him to stuff cos I wanted to make friends on my own etc etc. For some reason, as time went on, I found him less attractive (whether this was because he now wasn't (or rather I hadn't let him be) part of my uni life or I just grew apart from him) and I didn't want to be physical with him at all. I did however like him being in it life and knew that of we split up, I would lose my friend and that person I could still confide in when things weren't going so great. So I didn't want to break up with him. I am aware of how incredibly selfish that made me at the time, it was a life lesson! Anyway like I said, this may not be the case, just thought I'd offer a possible reason. 
Aside from this, people can go off sex when they are super stressed or have things on their mind. She might avoid any physical contact incase you try to take it further than a kiss and she doesn't want to have to turn you down and explain why. I guess you just have to ask her to be really honest with you. Sex/intimacy isn't the be all and end all of a relationship but it is the one thing that keeps you connected on that much deeper level and without it, you are essentially friends."
"He *is* free to leave. He is *completely* free to leave, just as he should be. But he's not leaving.

"As someone who used to be this girl when I was younger, this is so absolutely spot on it hurts.

I grew out of it and am happily married now and would never disrespect my husband like that or put myself in precarious situations anymore, but it took being about 26/27 and engaged to get there. "
I wonder if they would congratulate the daughter if she said she was pregnant. That might be a good way to get them to focus on the kids for at least 10 seconds.
You and your wife get no say in their choice to have children. Never say another word about it. It isn't difficult.

"Exact same thing happened to me, honey (+1 year). The thing I learnt from finally ditching him was that I wouldn't ever want to be married to someone who drags his feet like that. Current fianc√© and I discuss and agree on wedding details - ain't no way my ex would've done that without a shitload of moaning and making me feel like he was one foot out the door. I know my experiences won't convince you to leave, I remember that feeling. But just think - if he doesn't want to marry you now, he won't be more excited down the track. His love will only wane. Meanwhile you'll be getting older (meaning less time to have kids, if that's what you want), and wasting precious years with the man you're really meant to be with. Plus even when you're single, I can all but guarantee you'll feel more loved (by the family/friends you surround yourself with), and less lonely."
"Honey, he wants to by your boyfriend.

Do you want to be his girlfriend?

No?

Then you send him a text or email telling him that you are not interested in in any kind of relationship with him and want him to leave you alone.  And then you block him on social media, email and your phone.

No ""please,"" no ""sorry,"" no promise that maybe one day you can be friends, no ""this isn't a good time right now.""

How often do you risk seeing him in daily life?  "

Leave this in the past OP.
My guess is that the fact that he doesn't respect you intellectually is probably what's led you to believe he's 'certainly more intelligent than you in many aspects'. And I've never heard of a RP'er who didn't go around thinking that they're more intelligent than women by default. 
"I think it really is insane. Your husband needs a therapist, or medication perhaps.

That's not really how the wayback machine works. And it doesn't store youtube videos.
Wow. That just doesn't sound any better. This is so yucky. 
Ditto in the U.S. I'm not exaggerating when I say (sadly) that women here are constantly being murdered by husbands and boyfriends against whom they've taken out restraining orders. 
"OP's situation doesn't sound great, I don't think most people would come out and claim the baby for a small sum of money - child support and potential back child support would be hefty. You also assume the ex is rational; even if someone else came forward and claimed the baby, she may still be adamant it is his (given the length and number of people involved) and just go crazy on the other man too.

"I was laughing too- my mom is JUST like this!

You could get one of those folding Japanese screen things and position it in front of the window so that she can't see in.
"Replying hoping you'll see this but - are you sure the friend sent that and not the girlfriend? I'd try to find him face to face one more time.

If it is him, then yes as others said just communicate that you'll be there if he needs you and walk away.

If it's the girlfriend you might be able to help get through all this. Good luck, it definitely sucks."
"Yea, but they get a reaction out of her, right? She's more likely to walk him to wherever he wants at night if she gets to avoid pee cups."

But you already celebrated her 21st with her.  Let her have some room to do the same with her friends.  You are ALL important to her.
"He says -plainly- that she was resistant to him coming. Have you considered that he simply didn't care about her boundaries? He was not invited, he asked to be, she told him he could sleep on the sofa, and he then decided that she didn't really want him there. She did find him a place to sleep. He just decided it wasn't good enough. 

And she has no reason to find him a place to sleep other than the sofa. The girls who were invited first get those beds. No one should have to change their plans because he asked to come. As a grown adult, this shouldn't have to be explained to him. There is no reason to ship someone off to the sofa who already had a confirmed place to sleep. 


&gt;The third celebration was saved for her and her friends to rent an apartment, have some fancy predrinks then head out clubbing

Sounds like he was perfectly aware that this was her party with her friends, and what her plan was. "
"&gt;  A bump is just a cup of coffee that needs to be treated with more respect.

"You are asking liberal people advice about how to deal with conservative Muslim parents.

The advice isn't bad and it reflects how normal western families should behave. If you fight back, move out, or demand an apology you may be ostracized. So be prepared to be an outcast in your family and be prepare for most of your family to take their side. From their perspective you have abandoned their culture/tradition/norms.

Just don't be surprised that your non western family will not behave like a western family. If you are ready to pull the trigger than cool.

However if you wish to remain on good terms with your family, because you know family is family then I would recommend trying a more peaceful approach, but begin to distance yourself. "
"&gt; You are the source of the pain.

No, his failure to be a good partner is the source of his pain. Her leaving him is a logical, predictable consequence of being a bad boyfriend. This is entirely on him. 

I see guys like this all the time, who say they have ""depression"" and ""anxiety"" but aren't doing anything to combat it with therapy, medication, or exercise. Instead, they date sympathetic and VERY young women (OP was a teenager when they got together; he was in his mid-twenties), rush to cohabitation, and become financially dependent on them. The women then feel like they can't leave. They're logistically entangled, they love the guy, they worry about his very survival on his own. 

This is a very common strategy. OP should recognize it for what it is and cease feeling guilty immediately."

"It's one thing that they're different, but he can't even be assed to do something that would make her feel better that she explicitly requested and takes no time at all. He's just lazy, frankly, and inconsiderate. And that's the real problem. "
"Well reading your comment may have made me tear up just a tiny bit, you cut to the core of it. Thanks a lot! Really means a lot to me. It makes me feel a bit more brave, hearing all the good intentions and encouragements here, even if I'll have to do things myself. Yeah, you're great! I'm a fan. Thanks a lot. Think I'll have a talk with him tonight."
"Also if you tense up, it can be uncomfortable. Generally getting fingered doesn't hurt but it's kind of a surprising sensation the first time."
Kids can get bullied for anything and everything. One pink shirt is not going to make any difference. OP didn't say she's in the regular habit of buying him girl's clothes. 
"&gt;I know she never wanted a wedding. She has extreme social (""performance"") anxiety and she would always look to me for support and love whenever she felt that way. Her best friend and grandparents also said they would not be able to attend which I'm sure hurt her. I feel bad for not just eloping.

Was she pressured into the whole wedding ado? 

It's possible she freaked out about the event itself. It's also possible she fell out of love with you and did what she had to do, as she said. If you think it's possible the wedding itself was the problem, try to get a message to her. Let her know you'd marry her alone in a courthouse at any moment, and you're SO sorry you put her in such a scary position to satisfy the expectations of family/whatever reason the wedding was planned. It may be too late, she may have needed you to say that before you booked the venue and sent out invitations, but could be worth a shot."

"His grandfather is James, his father is James II, he's James III, anyone can connect the dots and see what his son would be named, or at least what he would want his son to be named.  I would think that in the face of that obvious family tradition, you choosing to marry him and have a baby with him would imply you're on board with it.  Or am I missing something about your relationship?  Like, is this an unplanned pregnancy and the tradition is being sprung on you now?"
"Chronic nerve pain/headaches from a car accident here!

Is there an alternate way she could use it, besides smoking? Maybe that could help break or soften your visceral reaction.. Vaporizers don't smell nearly as much, and smell can often elicit strong emotional reactions. If you're in a medical state, there are so many alternate forms she could get/try, as many people don't like smoking it.

Also, try to focus on the alternatives to this and how harmful they can be... There aren't any regular drugs that can be taken nearly so safely long term. Chronic pain itself changes your brain chemistry, uses up neurotransmitters and often leads to depression. 

I spent years trying everything the doctors gave me, but I don't like going through life as a lethargic zombie due to muscle relaxers, even the ""safer"" painkillers have risk of addiction that made me reject them as a long term solution. We tried several anti-inflammatories and they all wound up getting *recalled* for severe side effects (scary!) Surgery would have a 20% chance of leaving me paralyzed. Weed has been so helpful. "
"&gt;my ex girlfriend has started talking to me again and basically wants me. Is it bad that I'm more open to her than my wife??

"The comment is kind of akin to ""well have you tried just.. Not?"" "
"Is this a common thing for your friend to be doing? No.

Are you being overly dramatic because you feel uncomfortable about this? No.

Even if this were commonly accepted as an okay thing for your friend to be doing -- which it isn't -- it is making you feel uncomfortable, and you are totally within your rights to set boundaries on this.

You've tried telling her not to do it, and it hasn't worked.  You've tried ignoring her, and that hasn't worked either.  Normally, I'd say that the next step is to cut her out of your life as someone who is clearly unable to respect your clearly expressed boundaries.

However, you say that your friendship is otherwise great and you want to keep her as a friend if you can, so I suggest that you sit her down and give her one last opportunity to stop.  Tell her that it makes you feel uncomfortable, and that you don't want to hear about her sex life any more.  If she continues sending you these things, you'll have to decide whether you are going to put up with this for the sake of your friendship (I wouldn't!) or cut her out of your life, but at least you have given her one last chance to save the friendship."
"&gt; Frankly, the cruel things she says to your wife are unacceptable. If anyone said those things to my husband, they'd be gone from my life for good.

See, if I bought a partner to meet my family and they had a go at one of my siblings for being ""stupid"" because they were single and insulted them for being students.......I'd have dumped their fucking ass for disrespecting my family, not gone ahead and put a ring on it. "
You've put your needs and your plan on how to satisfy them on the table. DH didn't disagree. I think he's hoping you'll find a FWB so that sex won't be an obligation for him anymore. I think you're in a DADT relationship at this point. This seems like a reasonable answer until your son reaches independence. 
"I have seen some really beautiful women with some really ugly men (and vice versa.) I think your issue may be more than women are picking up on the fact that you are ... doing drugs and drinking to get closer to them? Or that you think of women as so superficial and simple-minded that they are only making decisions and attracted based on looks? Or that you can't think of another way to meet women then to be intoxicated, or find intoxicated women?

I think that's what needs to change - as well as finding people to hang out with that don't call you ugly. "
Haven't you seen the new article about how to talk to women who are wearing headphones?  It's as creepy as it sounds.

"A 'define the relationship' conversation doesn't mean you are moving fast. It's a discussion about where you see the two of you going, and it's a logistical conversation about expectations of fidelity and amount of time spent together.

"I knew someone from Morocco who was stuck in a similar situation. Her sister was able to get away and went to Canada. I think they had lived there before but got stuck once they went back to Morocco. Since you already speak French, why don't you seek asylum in Canada? You should file a report and if the police fail to do anything about it, it will act as proof that you are in danger, which you are."
"So I just wanted to add something just in case you don't think this is really a big deal. Maybe you're okay with it, for example. But keep in mind that not consenting means that you can't change the terms of your (non)agreement. So here are a few examples of reasons why even if I weren't upset, I wouldn't just let it go:

1. Birth control. Would you like to have a choice about whether or not you get pregnant? Because someone who doesn't give you a choice about sex might not give you a choice about reproduction, either. You can't really know his motives, and at the end of the day even if you use protection that you don't think he could mess with, how can you really be sure of what he'd do at this point? This is like the post the other day where someone's bf was drugging them without their knowledge. If you aren't consenting, you can't know whether he (for example) might do something that would compromise the effectiveness of your birth control. 

2. You say you have physical damage. That means he's being rougher than you would ever be comfortable with awake. If you spend a few minutes thinking about what that must look like you're going to be disturbed. Who hurts someone they care about in all of these different ways? What's to stop him from damaging you more if you have an argument and then go to bed?

3. This wasn't cleared by you ahead of time, so it's not even as though he can act like you have at any point consented. As others have pointed out that's definitionally rape. For many people this would be so far beyond what's acceptable that they would feel betrayed on so many levels, and rightly so. I'm betting that you never thought of him as the kind of guy who would do this to someone. What else might he be willing to do that you have never considered possible?"
"The amount of people saying OP is perfectly healthy is astounding. She is less than 5 lbs away from reaching overweight territory, but as long as her BMI hovers under 25, she's fine! It's shocking."
"Yeah, bringing up the possible sexual reproductive abilities of the baby is *totally not creepy at all.*

When I was pregnant, one of those dumb apps told me exactly the moment my daughter's ovaries and eggs were being formed and let's just move on right now."
"Girl let me just tell you, I am a 34B, and my boyfriend LOVES my boobs. He loves the size the shape, everything. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DUMP THIS GUY!!!! Find a real man!! I promise you you can do it. Not all men (or boys in your case) care this much about breast size. "
A 350lbs guy can be both a bodybuilder as a morbidly obese guy. Just because she is the same weight doesnt mean that she looks the same.
This just in: everyone with a mortgage who's ever gone to Starbucks is immoral trash.
"&gt; So are pro choice people only against those who try to force their choices on to others?

Yes.

There are plenty of pro-choice people who would never have an abortion themselves."
People have covered the other points pretty well. Why exactly did he lose his job? Did he quit or was he fired as a result of the incident? I'm not certain of the specific laws surrounding it but I'd reccomend checking out the fair work website and possibly contacting the fair work ombudsman as I'm pretty sure you can't be fired for a crime you have not been convicted of and it doesn't even sound like charges were laid.
"There's nothing you can do, the legal homeowners ""your parents"" have to go through the states legal eviction procedures to kick him out. If they try anything else they could get sued."

If she needs professional help that can happen via the legal system forcing her to be hospitalized. Anything other than calling the police would be dangerous. 
cool cool. You should comment on OP's comment to make sure they see it. 
"Uhh..

what


1.You have her pic as a wallpaper? what the fuck? I mean, if she was your girlfriend it'd be normal, obviously, but you never even talked to her


2.You can't love her if you don't know her. You love what you think she is- she might be cool and funny, but she can't be 100% what you think she is.


3.Leave her alone. Nothing will come out of it. Delete the wallpaper and move on."

"I agree with OP, we might as well assume ""innocent until proven guilty"". There is no reason to think he's done it before or is lying. But that didn't really matter does it? He's being creepy and breaking ethics rules RIGHT NOW. Whether or not he did it before isn't really necessary to condemn his actions."
"If that were true, why would he go out on one of the nights she's home? "
Have you actually told him that you'd prefer a more straight performance at least some of the time?  Seems pretty straight-forward.
He can wear some fucking jeans.  Jeans are not a tux.

"If your mum and sisters can treat you like this because you finally had the guts to leave an abusive relationship then shame on them!

You really are better off without them. No matter what they say and do, dont stay in something unhappy and miserable for you because you should put your well being and happiness first.

Drew is an abusive man and he thought he could get away with being vile and horrible to you. Well he thought wrong. He couldn't manipulate you forever and now hates the fact he hasn't got a hold on you. He can't manuplate you anymore so he is manuplating your own family!! 

Do yourself a favour and cut contact with ALL of them. It's your mum's loss if she is willing to put someone like drew in front of you. Let her make this stupid mistake and then let her regret it. Cut this negativity out!

Don't go back with drew because he is 'sad' and it will make things easier with your family. You deserve so much more than this bullshit. You are not in the wrong.

Move in with your friend, move on with your life. Start something with Glenn if you want because you are single and Free!"
"You are creeping her. When she unfriended you, it meant she no longer wants contact with you. Now her friends have unfriended you; it means leave her alone. You cheated on her; she wants you out of her life. There's no great mystery here. Move on with your life."
"I was in exactly your position. I also contracted genital HSV-1 from oral sex with a partner who got cold sores, but was asymptomatic at the time.  Some things you may or may not know:

It is *not* 'highly unlikely' to contract HSV-1 genitally from someone who has HSV-1 orally, or with no symptoms.
It is less common, but not uncommon, to have HSV-1 genitally (increasing prevalence of oral sex).
You *do not have to have symptoms* to pass on the virus. 
A *majority* of the population carry the HSV virus.
The virus can remain dormant for a significant portion of time before becoming symptomatic, so it's almost impossible to pinpoint where it came from - it is really no indication of infidelity on either part. You may even have contracted it from a previous partner, and it's only become symptomatic recently.
Those who have HSV-1 genitally tend to have fewer outbreaks, but slightly worse severity. HSV-2 genitally tends to recur more frequently, but with slightly lower severity.
Condoms can reduce risk of transmission, but do not eliminate it.
For the vast majority of people, HSV is nothing but a minor inconvenience, and outbreaks tend to get less and less of an issue as time goes on.

As your partner gets cold sores, *he already has HSV*. He has herpes. There's a chance he could start having outbreaks genitally, but as the virus is already in his system and he has antibodies against it, it's much less likely for him to start showing symptoms in the genital area. 

This may have been tough on your husband psychologically - feeling like he's caused this for you might affect his desire. He may also have (even unconscious) worries about the virus, if he's not super well informed about it - so many people think that cold sores aren't 'real herpes' or the 'same kind' as genital herpes, but it is.

When you sit down together to talk about this, how do you frame your concerns? It can be easy to fall back on 'you' arguments rather than 'I' statements, which makes everybody feel defensive and tends to go down badly. Have you considered writing down things you'd like to ask him, or specific issues you'd like to address (thinking about wording) and bringing a kind of 'prompt' card with you to the discussion? I find this can help with conversations like this where things can get emotional/heated quickly, to bring things back.

One further note: *if* you were to end the relationship and look for other partners, you should disclose your HSV status. It isn't fun, but you've got to give your partners, however casual, the choice to make an informed decision about something which could affect their health.

[edit to add: *this last part is really important*. The guy who passed on HSV-1 to me knew that he carried the virus, had felt 'tingles' (often a sign an outbreak is going to occur, as I'm sure you know) and **still said nothing to me**. He took away my choice, and that's why I will **always** allow my partners to make that decision.]"
"Also, by asking to put yourself on a dating site for attention, you are telling your girlfriend that **her love and attention isn't enough for you**. That is incredibly hurtful and insulting to your relationship."
"In addition to what the other commenters have mentioned, your brother will also be kicked out of his martial arts class. Using martial arts as a means of violence and committing a crime is not taken lightly by martial arts teachers.

"I'm relieved that she wasn't complicit in the prank, and I hope you can lean on her during this tough time. 

That being said, I think that involving her without explaining her part in this is another indicator of his lack of sense and tact. He essentially lied to her and used her as a prop in his ""funny prank."" You don't just bring other people into games like this without their informed consent!"

Its really just as easy as this.  Props if you say this when she approaches you during your lunch, while you have a big plate of food right in front of you."
"This is such a sad situation. In the majority of cases it is very unlikely that a patient will regain consciousness after being comatose for months. It really sounds like your boyfriend was aware of this and truly believed that you would never wake up. It sounds like he was genuinely devastated and mourned you. However that does not mean that your feelings are invalid.  Of course you feel hurt and betrayed. 

I think that you have two options. 1. Work through the hurt and resentment, possibly in couples counseling or 2. End the relationship.  If you think there is the possibility that you could one day forgive him then I'd suggest option 1. If after working through it you're still feeling resentful and end the relationship then at least you'll know that you tried"
"Exactly! Think of how hard you ground for that job and look at where you are at now. You didn't work this hard and get this far just to drop to a job where you are making the same money as I am and I'm 21 just starting school.

"how is wearing a bra determination of whether or not they're ""marriage worthy"". Don't even see how its a compatibility thing but sure hes free to go out and find someone else. "
"There's a huge difference between ""I'm attracted to someone else"" and ""I've thought about cheating with someone else"". Cheating imo should be something that you never even consider. Something that is NOT a possibility. Because if it remains one, what is going to happen in ten years when they are having a rough patch and they're exhausted by the kids and haven't had sex in 2 months and he's a bit drunk? Well he's gonna cheat is what's gonna happen."
"Yea the fighting is ""fun"" I don't get unless like you say its fetish play or they just love make up sex.. even then 8 hours fighting sounds emotionally traumatic never mind a solid week"
"&gt;I really like her and was going to tell her how I felt about her. Before I could tell her, she said that she'd heard something from someone and she wasn't interested.

She knows you like her. It's probably super obvious to her, but she doesn't like you the same way. She wanted to shut this down before you could say anything she didn't want to hear and to minimize the awkwardness.

&gt;I told her that I appreciated her honesty, but now I wish I'd told her anyway and asked her more questions.

So despite her shutting you down before you got a chance to speak, you wish you would have steamrolled over that obvious rejection to make her explain herself? Yeah, that's romantic, dude. I bet that would have worked just like in all those not-totally-creepy-at-all rom-coms.

By her reaction, I can tell that she was really uncomfortable about being put in this position of having to reject you. She thought you were a friend, she got hints that you liked her, but she hoped it would never come up. But it did, and she had to sit with the anxiety of having to shut you down until you approached her, so it came out before you could do your thing. 

Was it polite? No, but due to your ages, I'm not surprised she doesn't have the poise to handle a situation like this. You're both learning the ups and downs of dating at this age and the initial stages are always going to be rough. No one ever knows how to handle interpersonal relationships out the gate, so try not to be too upset at her unless she gives you an actual reason like a personal attack or something.

If she is a genuine friend to you, and not someone you only saw as a potential girlfriend and not someone you're going to cling to hope over, then absolutely talk to her (so long as the purpose of talking it out *isn't* to make an argument for giving you a chance or to go on about how much you like her as more than a friend). If she's not interested in being friend or wants space, then you'll have to move on and chalk this up to a learning experience that if you pursue a friend, then the friendship might be ruined."
