"&gt; Go take half the money out of the joint account and put it in an account in just your name.

NO NO NO NO NO! This is **HORRIBLE** advice.

OP do not do this. This can be considered hiding assets. Do not do anything in regards to finances until you have consulted a lawyer."
This is hilariously bad advice. I get the sympathy part but this is shitty advice. She is not some victim. 
 No. Your personal belongings are not her responsibility. Not at all. This is your adult life failing and any accommodation to you is a charity on her/Bill's part. 
"I think it would be good to talk with her about how a healthy marriage works, since I'm sure she hasn't seen examples of it in her life. In a healthy marriage, the closer you get, the more able you are to figure out how to appropriately reduce the burden her personal issues have on each of you. As you work on your marriage, you'll be less likely to do and say things that trigger her, she'll have someone to work through stuff with, and any guilt about being a good partner can be lessened. "
"I'd bet money she wasn't chosen because bride knew OP would just shut up and take it. 

Bride is ridiculous. She gets OP to help plan the wedding, excludes OP from it, now wants OP to drive her broken ass to the doctor and listen to her whine about her cast. "
"She doesn't want a friend, she wants a caretaker. Someone who will keep her company and make her life easier. If the situation were reversed, would she come to help you? If the honest answer to that question is no then you guys were never friends. She hung out with you because you were a convenient option."
"If you were truly pro-life, you wouldn't have had sex in the first place unless you were 100% wanting children.

Get an abortion.  Get an abortion.  Get an abortion."
Most girls and women have that experience. 
"Sorry, I seem to have nodded off and woken up in the 19th Century. "
"You are an adult and there really isn't much they can do to *force* you to comply to their curfew.  They *can* throw you out, though.

Think long and hard about what their reaction might be.

If they do throw you out, is there somewhere you can go?  Can you support yourself?  Have they co-signed school loans, car loans etc.?  Make darn sure that you have everything tucked away like precious things, ID and other important papers, so they can't hide it on you.  Be ready to go at a moments notice.  Depending on how you think they might react, have a go-bag.  

Legally they probably would have to comply to your state's laws regarding tenants.  Find out what they are because they depending on how the laws are written, they may be forced to allow you access to your stuff and give you 30-60 days notice.  Check it out, though as it differs highly depending on where you are.

Also keep in mind they have plenty of ways of making your life miserable even if they don't throw you out.  Be aware and have plans for what to do it x, y and z might happen.  Make sure you have *options*."
"That's not tough love. It is abuse. He is manipulating you to stay with him and verbally as well as emotionally abusing you to the point that you think this is normal. Please, have a trusted friend or family member help you and get out of there."
"He acknowledged that it was his wife, and deleted his own post. He didn't mention anything about the short notice - just that they had been petsitting. The main point of his post was he wasn't sure she'd be able to handle the stress of a baby. "
"I really don't think this is the kind of thing that's going to convince a family judge to revoke his visitation rights. I agree it's shitty and emotionally abusive, but a point blank ""no visits with your children"" order comes with a very high bar. "
"I'm sorry to say that, because I don't know if your sister has ""just"" been incredibly stupid and negligent, but there have been cases of parents voluntary leaving babies in car to kill them. You 100% did the right thing because this baby was in terrible danger."
When I get wound up I can't focus on exercise but it's the thing most people recommend... I understand their medically established point but it doesn't work like that in my head... probably true for others
"People call other people the wrong name all the time, it's nothing to be bent out of shape about, just go up to her and say ""hey, (name), sorry I called you the wrong name the other day, I don't know what I was thinking"" and start talking about something else. "
"It's food, dude. Not fuckin drugs"
"Elderly/disabled are indeed sometimes only after expenses (the net threshold).  I was suggesting that the poster looks at the deductions because she does not specify that she is over the gross or net threshold; it's quite possible that she's under gross for the household, but missing a deduction and being over the net threshold.  Obviously, if she's over the gross, she's out, but that's where checking additional supplemental programs that are sometimes state-based might work.  "

"This seems to be more common (here) than I would think for something that you know is really irrational. She is a normal woman with normal sexual experiences that she has learned from. You are actually better off because of these experiences. So, look at it as a positive.
"
"&gt;She took vitamin C and sunflower seeds and induced a miscarriage at home.

I'm sorry. Out of all of the WTF shit in your post, this is the most WTF.

Vitamin C and sunflower seeds DO NOT CAUSE MISCARRIAGE.

What the everliving fuck."
"This is clearly another salvo fired by FIL in that war, the bastard. Stay out of it, support your husband. "
"To be honest, and speaking as a boss, what he said sounds perfectly reasonable. He didn't tell you to put yourself in danger. He asked about the conditions and advised you to get there as soon as you could (which could be ""tomorrow"", right?) since he was unable to help at the time. You could have replied that in your assessment the conditions were too poor for travel and asked him for further orders in light of that information."
That's actually quite brilliant and sad.
"Why are you doing something bad to him? You want to live alone with your man. That's normal. Stop framing it as harming him. He has a girlfriend and his own social life (and if he doesn't, your friendship is enabling him and it's a another good reason to kick him out). You're braver than you think. Just get it over with."
Maybe he thinks you're strong enough to handle your own conflicts and doesn't want to risk getting his ass kicked.
Please don't think about this! It honestly does not matter. 
"You do realize he's escalating back into physical violence, right?"
"Bad in-laws are pain in the ass for a lifetime. Your boyfriend is simply not worth the trouble because in this tug of war he will never be on your side. You deserve someone who will shield you from toxic people, not introduce them in your life. "
"Feeling that grief is normal, verbalizing it is a different story. It's not that he's not allowed to miss her, it's just disrespectful to you. As a 21-year-old he hasn't quite grasped that friendships/relationships come and go and the ones that are important will stay, like yours if it continues to be healthy and love each other. However, if this is something that does not stop it would be justifiable to end things because he's not putting you as the most important person in his life, and as a significant other that will not work out long term."
"You need to sit down and approach this with her, trying to fight for her side. When you and her both feel level headed.

""Why do you feel uncomfortable with me having a running partner who is a woman?""

And just listen, don't try to fix until she's done talking. And before you offer a solution, ask. ""What can I do to ease your concerns about it?""

If she says. ""Don't have a female running partner.""

I'd suggest. ""I don't feel that's fair, her and I share a hobby, and this hobby is much easier to do with a motivator doing the same hobby. I don't think I should be denied a partner just because she happens to be a woman.""

I don't know where you'd go from there, if it is really difficult to talk it out with her, there may be jealousy and insecurity issues that require marriage counseling. This is just my two cents. "
"I once heard a motivational speaker tell a story about a dog he saw who was lying on the ground,  moaning and groaning and in clear discomfort.

The speaker asked the owner, ""Why is your dog moaning and groaning like that?"" The owner replied, ""Because he's lying on a piece of broken glass."" 

The speaker was shocked and asked, ""Why on earth doesn't he get off it?"" The owner said, ""Because he's not in enough pain to motivate him to move."" 

You may not be in ""enough of a bad situation"" to want to run away immediately, but ask yourself what is motivating you to stay, apart from procrastination? "
There is a school playground a short distance from where we live as well as many parks. 
"Report the event anyway. It's good to have a paper trail. If for whatever reason the police don't help you now, it'll be hard to deny the frequency of these events in the future. It'll also come in handy if you ever need to fight for custody of your children. "
This should be much higher up.
"install a cheap camera to monitor the front of your house, way better then a still picture which is arbitrary and could be taken whenever. a camera will document where the car is and when these neighbors decide to leave nice little ""messages"" on your friends car"
"The real deal breaker here is not the sexual behavior but the hiding and the dishonesty -- and then, the trickle truthing and the general not owning up to it. This is a want to have my cake and eat it, too, behavior, not a ""I want to negotiate a honest, adult relationship with my partner whom I respect"" behavior. This guy is absolutely putting getting what he wants first, not getting in trouble second, and only then his relationship with you -- and its authenticity. That is the part that is most bothersome about this. 

Do not have kids with this guy yet. If this is his MO, he will be nowhere near ready to put his family first. A guy like this becoming a dad = trying to skive off caretaking responsibility as much as possible 'cause he wants to drink with friends or play videogames. This dude is not mature enough to be a husband. If you decide to dtmf, I understand."
"The same is true in the Netherlands. Yet in both countries sex trafficking is very much an issue. A quick Google search should show you the website refworld.org: 

""GERMANY: Tier 1

Germany is a source, transit, and destination country for women, children, and men subjected to sex and labor trafficking.

(...)

In 2013, the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics were available, state and federal authorities completed 425 sex trafficking investigations, compared with 491 in 2012. Authorities prosecuted 118 defendants for sex trafficking in 2013, compared with 142 in 2012.

(...)

Authorities identified 542 sex trafficking victims in 2013, compared with 612 in 2012"""
"Thank you for the validating my feelings. If it hadn't affected my life so much, I highly doubt I would care. But it also affects her relationship with my children because her current boyfriend is not someone I would want them around. "
"That's completely fair. And I do feel bad about changing my mind. But as our daughter gets older, I began to dread more and more the idea of having to do that baby thing all over again."
"&gt; I wouldn't call the cat ""defenseless""

You should. A cat against a grown man is no contest, and you need to protect your cat if your bf snaps."
"Emotional abuse, get the hell out of that relationship. I don't care how well he treats you otherwise. There are nice ways to say he's worried about your health, or offer his true opinion if you ask him - but this is NOT that. He met you while you were heavier - if he didn't accept you then, why would he continue a relationship with you? "
"Also, everyone says OP is mature for her age."
"The key difference here is not mechanical. Your husband sounds like he cares about your pleasure, which is great for you, but OP's husband clearly doesn't. "
"My advice was not to tell her. Even so, I can see your point of view and I agree with you on some level. Yes, it's a shitty thing to lie for 40+ years, essentially leaving the other person in the dark. But I think it's even shittier to confess now, at this point, when that window of opportunity has already passed a long time ago, making the wife possibly very miserable, questioning their entire relationship, etc etc. 


I think that both things are bad, but you have to choose the one that makes the less damage. Be merciful, in a way."
"Almost every response (including this one) shows what the problem is. You. You're dramatic, and when reading all of these all I can think of is a self absorbed teenager. It's also clear you came here for people to tell you ""you're wife is ridiculous! Go ahead and do what you want to do and not give any effort towards the woman you married and have built a family with because she's boring!!!! Totally legitimate!!!""...  and since that's not what you're getting you're making excuse after excuse for yourself. My guess is you're still going to try and justify this and eventually go against your wife's wishes (and a plethora of people telling you she's being reasonable) to go run w/ miss twenty something."
Wut. Dogs can't compromise it's a dog. You are so wrong in the situation here it's not like you're being sent to the kennel while the dog is in your GF's bed. 
"Put yourself in her shoes for a second.

If you were my best friend, I'd be very upset you didn't tell me about it. Why did you keep it to yourself? Look into the reasons that things are happening.

- You didn't tell her about it. Why?
- You didn't cut him out of your life earlier, and tell him how you felt about what he was doing, why? 

Genuinely explore the reasons/answers to these questions.

Imagine you're so desperate to keep your bf, or ex bf, that you're willing to arrange FWB with him. Imagine that, and now imagine your best friend has known he's had a thing for her this whole time, and while you're in shambles trying to make things work she has a key piece of information that would help you move on and cut ties - aka work towards being happier.  

It isn't too late to talk to her about it. If you had good intentions, let her know about them. I think myself, and most others, would want to know if their best friend knew something, and would definitely expect to hear about it."
"Oh my god I can only imagine my face if a guy asked me about baby names on the first date. In the first MONTHS I would be freaked out, much less the first date. Gross. I think I would likely make a secret escape out of the bathroom window. "
Exactly.  So why are you still in this marriage?
"I've pet sat for a week before. I didn't expect payment because it was for my best friend. I think i got a $20 Steam gift card for 2 visits a day. It's called being a kind fucking person. And if they agree to do it with what they consider little pay, they need to follow through. That's how the world works."
"Yeah ""cleared"" the night... lol."
There are. He is not one of them.
"&gt;  if you can actually let it go and be the bigger man.

I hate how you call letting it go ""being the bigger man"". That implies that it would be somehow wrong or unjustified for OP to not let it go. That is not the case. His wife betrayed and lied to him for a decade. It would be perfectly OK if he never let this go. I certainly wouldn't"
It is strange that the other two were bridesmaids. 
"I think your husband needs therapy. It sounds like he isn't dealing with your son's condition very well, and right now it's presenting as extreme anger at his mother.

Of course your MIL shouldn't have hit your son, but she clearly feels bad about, she was open and honest with you about it, and she definitely has your son's best interest in mind. She goes to therapy sessions and learns the best way to calm him so that she can provide the best possible care for him. This is not the norm when it comes to grandparents. She honestly sounds like one of the good ones and I hope that your husband can forgive her for your entire family's sake. "
You need to tell her that there is no rush or pressure.  That its OK if she's not ready.  Take away her reason for feeling guilt.  It takes both of you to have a family and live the 'happily ever after'...tell her that she's worth the wait...however long she needs.  Then no more talks of future family making.  If you two do spend the rest of your lives together...then whats the rush?  My hubby proposed 4 months in and I said no.  I told him that if we do tie the knot...that we needed to do things right - not fast.  So there'd be no regrets down the road.  He accepted that and didn't ask again.  Five years later...we got married after I asked him.  Together 14 years so far...no regrets on waiting.
This. Get rid of the ring on ebay if you can (might even make a bit more back from it even) And 100% get a different ring for next time that looks nothing like this one as it would remind her of a bad time.
"&gt; Is there any chance of convincing her?

So you're saying that you don't give a damn about her values.

If you don't respect her, break up with her."
"That's his interpretation then. His behavior is his responsibility, not yours. "
"Even if he were paying for it, being the breadwinner doesn't give someone the right to make unilateral decisions. They don't get to control you just because they make the money, know what I mean? That's just as antiquated an idea."
"I doubt that he actually feels like he owes her, to keep his promises - I think he's using the notion as a promise to both dismiss his questionable behavior and to paint himself as a saint because of it. Like OP confronts him and says it bothers her, and his response is that she should probably be glad he's doing it. He either has a  fucked up concept of promises when it comes to an ex or he's deliberately manipulating the situation (twisting the logic) to his advantage. 

 His reasoning sounds more like a cover up than it does something out of sincerity - if it was the latter, I feel like there would be an apology and promise to do OP better moving forward, which he doesn't seem to have done. And that's without addressing this New Years bit too."
"Yeah OP in addition to sorting out your husband's behavior you'll need to grow a backbone when it comes to disciplining your kids, too. Otherwise they'll learn from dad that it's ok to walk all over you."

"The least she could have done was lock the dog up, hide the other dog and cat in a room, and taken the attacked cat to the vet."
"Yeah, I mean 19 - wow that's soooo old. You should definitely give up."
"I was just pointing out the fallacy of your argument. But since you asked, personally I stopped seeing young teens as hot once I was no longer a teen myself. Just thinking about sleeping with someone 10 years my junior makes me squeamish. However, if OP truly looks exactly the same minus the tan, there was no reason to even post the part about her being 15 in the photo, since him sending it to himself against her wishes would be the sole issue."
This. OP should ask his wife if she would treat their kids as cash cows like her parents are with her.
"TBH I think he's cheating, or HAS cheated, and now she's blackmailing him. "
"Also, you don't have to use your facebook profile picture on tinder do you? So it doesn't really matter what the facebook profile says."
"I agree it's normal, if my gf shaved her head I wouldn't find it attractive.

What I think is not normal is ""feeling awful"" about it.  I understand if someone feels bad for something they said or did but I don't get it when people say they feel awful about something out of their control.

I guess it just seems like an empty gesture and takes away from the meaning.  Like that Seinfeld episode where that lady kept saying everything was ""stunning""."
"You can't just ""fix"" someone else, and nothing in your relationship was ever normal. You're setting yourself up for an even worse, more abusive relationship because you put up with his crap. Why do you want to put up with any of this? Because it'll let you move out of your parents' house? You're only trading one cage for a crappier one."
"The lie and betrayal come from not telling her right away and allowing her to make her own informed decision as to whether she wants to stay with someone who cheated on her. If he had told her it's very possible their entire marriage would not have even existed, so yes, it is all built on a lie. Personally if I was the wife and found out now, I would be more upset by this than by the cheating act itself. "
"&gt;The reason I don't think he would ever cheat is he was cheated on before and it really affected him. 

Ehh, that doesn't mean much, unfortunately. It sounds quite likely that he is cheating.  

Whatever it is, stop wondering and confront him. You don't need to make any specific accusations, but you can tell him what you've noticed and ask for an explanation. "
"It is just how he is manifesting his anger, he is angry about something and so he has chosen a topical issue to justify his anger. It is a normal thing for healthy teenagers to do, if he already struggles with mental illness then it is even more likely.

Let him come to you if he wants you to do something for him. If he wants womens clothes, he can come ask and you can say yes or no. If he asks ""would you buy me womens clothing if I asked?"" then he is pretty much saying he doesn't want it, but wants to be mad at you for not letting him have it.

You just need to do what you can which is get him therapy ASAP and make sure he is well looked after in the mean-time. Ensure he knows he can talk to you or other people, which he knows, and if he has something to say then he will probably say it. Seems he is just playing games at the moment."
"Exactly. He claims to care so much about his little girl but he has damaged her prior-to-this perfectly happy and secure relationship, and if she and OP break up now, he will be the direct cause of it (well, to be fair actually she will be the cause because it will be her lack of an acceptable reaction to the seriousness of her father's actions that would cause OP to break up, but you see what I mean).

EDIT OP u/CleUrbanist in your discussion you need to seriously impress upon her that you view this as incredibly serious and disturbing and a potential dealbreaker. Sit her down and say:

 ""Gf *we need to talk*^(TM) I have been very happy in our relationship thus far and thought that we had a promising future. But now a very serious issue has come up for me, and unless it can be resolved to my satisfaction, I will unfortunately have to reassess staying in this relationship, which would be a huge shame because I really like you. I would like you to please hear me out while I explain and when I am done I hope that we can come to a constructive resolution together. Please understand that I am deadly serious and this is no laughing matter.""

Then proceed with your story once you have made her aware of the stakes here and that any reaction other than complete support of you and any attempt to dismiss or laugh off your concerns will not fly. Make clear that no further contact from her father to you in any way, and his not being allowed in your home are completely non-negotiable."
"Don't do anything. Meeting up for coffee doesn't mean you start planning your life together. She thought you were meeting up as friends. She didn't owe you anything. 

You can say hello and make small talk, but do not bring up relationships or feelings at all. Ask her how she is, hows school, end of story. 

"
"Help them choose a female therapist who is not your friend. They won't be comfortable talking with a man who is also your friend, I promise you. I'm pretty sure they last thing they want right now is to be left alone in a room with an older man, not including you.

Child abusers are amazing at covering their tracks and convincing their victims to keep quiet. Don't beat yourself up - and maybe consider a therapist for yourself as well. Remember - the most important thing is that you believed them. A lot of abused kids don't get that luxury."
"If I were thinking of marrying someone and they were already telling me upfront they wanted to live in a way that I absolutely do not, that would be more than enough to immediately take the marriage off the table. I would be open to working on it but if they wanted something that I think is ridiculous as far as my lifestyle choices, eventually the relationship would end. I don't believe in setting myself up for failure."
"A few things, OP is saying it's not worth going to small claims court because she would lose more money by taking a full day off from work to court to court than the amount she could potentially recover in court.

Financially, it would not make sense to take this to court.

Also, small claims court is absolutely not legally required to be televised. That's ridiculous. Judge Judy is not an actual judge. She's an arbitrator. Those who agreed to be on Judge Judy agreed to drop their case in the courts in order to be paid to have their dispute resolved by a TV personality.

Small claims court is not like what you see on Judge Judy."
"Also keep in mind OP, your daughters might not be the most comfortable for a male therapist. I am a family therapist and we are all bound by confidentiality. I'm sure your friend can recommended someone!"
"&gt;He is willing to promise me he won't, but then continue to do so.

Then why are you dating him? 

He's so creepy he should have a bell around his neck. "
"Nice humblebrag, have fun!"
"My father did this exact thing to my stepmother. They got married and the three of us came to the US and he turned into an abusive bastard. She never left him and, 40 years later, is still in a miserable and abusive marriage with an asshole. "
OMG. He is a sick fuck.
"Maybe he realized after the last birthday that he spent too much money, and told himself he wouldn't do that again."
"God, it really bums me out how often socially inept douches like OP read genuine human kindness as sexual interest. Like, she enjoys your company and trusts you enough to share intimate details of her life with you. I've had plenty of female friends that were this close to me and I've never felt entitled to be with any of them. It's not fucking rocket-science. If your bro came over, cracked a beer with you and talked about his abusive father and how much it was fucking him up, would you assume he was displaying sexual interest, OP? Your weird inability to cherish a valuable friendship for what it is is frankly fascinating."
"Three of the pediatricians at my kids doctor office have said cosleeping is fine &amp; two of them have done or are currently doing it. it can be done safely, easily."
"Tell the sister after she's already moved all her stuff out of the sister's place. ""Hey roommate, I am so sorry to do this to you, but these are the things your brother did to me and I am very scared. I understand this is hard on you; here is February's rent and utilities, and I can help you look for a new roommate if you want."" "
"I think you need to spell out for him very clearly that no, there is no chance; you are very uncomfortable and disappointed in him; and if he wants you to forget about this at least as far as his wife and the rest of your friends are concerned, he needs to ensure that nothing like it ever happens again.  Then decline any one-on-one invitations and just be polite but distant with him at group events from now on, at least until it's clear he's over it.  Let him explain to his wife why things are weird if she notices.  And if he persists, then do what you have to do."
"It's such a main problem that you utterly failed to mention it in your post.

Have her get an STD screen if that's what you're worried about. But it sounds like you've been banging her unprotected, so you can't be that worried."
"Wow. I really don't know how to help you. But I feel so damn sad for you. Unfortunately hindsight is 20/20 and now you're in a country you can't leave and you're basically screwed. If I were you, I'd ghost my parents and never see them again. Do you have any time to yourself? Do you know if you can sneak out of the country or go to an embassy? God my heart breaks for you. Religion is the scourge of mankind and I'm really sorry it's destroyed this part of your life. I'm happy you've found a second family. I hope you get back to them. I'd recommend that once you do, never speaking to your parents again. Is there another country you can get to without a passport? Can you claim refugee status as an abused child? Your parents clearly don't understand or love you as a human being. Because their religion has prevented that. They love you as a piece of property. 

If there's anything else you need help with, PM me

Edit. I second your bf trying to marry you. If he wouldn't be in any danger in Oman...but that's pretty unlikely :/ "
"&gt; My response was that before I made the relationship open I would like for us to try couples therapy. My goal would be to hopefully repair and focus on improving our sex life so that she does feel fulfilled, and that she doesn't have any need to seek fulfillment elsewhere.

There's nothing that can really be ""repaired"" here. She wants to fool around with a female. You're not a female. You don't have what she needs/wants. That's of course not your fault and not something to feel guilty about, though. I'm just not sure therapy could do anything for this situation.

Is an open relationship something you would feel comfortable with? If you have the *slightest* doubt, you need to voice this to your gf. If either one of you sacrifice what you want/need for the other person, one of you will be resentful.

"
"I could barely get past the second point. I would have dumped him right then and there. His attitude and reaction show that he is not a safe person to have sex with.

This dude doesn't respect you.

Also, he's not using his comics to apologize. He's using them to be a passive aggressive douchebag."
Those sure are a lot of words you're putting in my mouth. I'll go ahead and let you have the last one.
"Dude how can we get this girl the fuck outta there?! Im so sad she didn't post earlier about going back to Oman. Everyone would have said ""helllll no stay in Ireland. Tell your family to come to Ireland. Never go back!"" And you know, I really hate to think I'm telling a girl to do that. But religion and government intertwined makes for a very toxic shitty situation. "
"Yeah, it keep getting worse and worse and I finally read that and was like NOPE.

  Wonder how much her sticking around him has to do with the fact that she’s 28 and probably feels like she needs to settle down? "
"I work with children and its always important not to say they are bad, otherwise eventually they will associate themselves with being bad. Instead its the behaviour you explain hurts others. Maybe start some rules and clear boundaries if you mind him again further down the road, and praise him when he shows he obeys the rules. Good luck"
"Has Facebook never suggested you add someone based on one mutual?

While you're thinking about that: stop blaming your girlfriend for someone's choice to add her on Facebook and grow all the way up."
Nobody ever sees what really goes on behind closed doors.  Hugs.
"""Long distance girlfriend of 1.5 years went abroad for 3 months, had sex with some guy and lied to me about it. I found out by logging in her facebook messages yesterday and confirmed that she did cheat on me. Still love her, but don't know ""


Why do you still love her? She's an awful person who lies to you and manipulates you. If you stay with her, you're giving her permission to do this again.



Do not be weak. Right now, you're being weak. How to approach this? Approach with ""It's over."""
Probably because she can see the logic in how stupid the advice to not go is.
"&gt; Apparently that's his ex's privacy.

How?  He can't tell you what was going through *his* own head when he said ""all right, let's go for it"" without spilling her personal business?  Because if he was trying to be a supportive figure in her life and that got out of hand, that's still *him* failing to set appropriate boundaries.  And if he's still not comfortable talking it out with you, can he at least take it to a therapist?"

"My advice would be to stay out of relationships for a decent period of time. Work on yourself and try to figure out why continue to seek out abusive partners. People don't just ""fall into"" abusive relationships; they (at least subconsciously) seek out and attract abusive individuals. The issues lie within you.

This behavior is invasive, possessive, insecure, and criminal (destruction of property). That your reaction to this is ""at least he doesn't beat me"" is not indicative of a healthy sense of self-worth. Get single, stay single, go to therapy to work on you. You're worth much more than someone who would treat you like this."

"&gt; I feel like I don't have much to offer but a check though.

To be quite honest, most charities would rather have the financial support than another set of hands.  Volunteers will always need training and supervision, professionals will always need to be contracted.  Printers need ink, computers need power... you get the idea.

You can certainly take time to find and evaluate a few organizations that support causes you are passionate about, but the opportunity cost of being on the front line, especially at your level, just doesn't make sense.  

Where you can do the most good in addition to direct financial support is through the high end fundraising events, since you likely have connections with others who would be willing to attend or at least direct some of their Charitable Donations budget at your suggestion.

You benefit from this as well since it puts you in contact with people with both means and interests similar to your own."
"Ummmm dude clearly something is going on and this is NOT ok. I'm not sure how you're this calm about it. How did you make up after that fake plane ticket/trip?? She's obviously lying!! Omg.

I would say this is more than enough proof to confront her with but you let her ""explain"" everything away, even things that don't make sense. 

I've never been married so I'm not quite sure of how intensely people take ""til death do us part"" stuff but I imagine if you stay together that you need to get her to admit this, stop this, and then work together to move on. Have you sat her down seriously and talked to her about all the proof and how you don't like their relationship and what not?"
"Just a thought (even though I hate drugs and even worse the idea of dealing them) but perhaps he didn't tell you to spare you from any legal consequences if he got caught or perhaps he didn't say anything because he was really ashamed and embarrassed. And slightly less likely but perhaps he really did get more hours too and has been dealing the whole time! I don't know, I just think...as weird and twisted as it is, he's providing for you and supporting you and being a real humble SO. I don't know how mad I could be either tbh but I'm also not in the states so dealing pot isn't a big deal."
"dude, by that logic, people shouldn't ever drink alcohol because it lowers inhibitions and people do stupid shit. I've done WAY WAY stupider shit drunk than on molly, well the gay sex i feel wasn't STUPID so much as it opened up a pleasure that i didnt feel before, it didnt necessarily impair my judgement. If I had a problem with molly, like i was addicted, yeah i would stop. But i do it like, maybe once every 4 or so months, and the positives ALWAYS outway the negatives. Even though there were consequences to that night i still had an amazing time. 

Like its just not really the situation to input your anti drug views here, it doesn't have really anything to do with that. "
"Seriously, act like you don't care what people think, and keep living your life how you want to live it. Many people see sexuality as a very black and white thing, but in many cases, it's not. When people think of what heterosexuality is, they typically think it's a sexual attraction to the opposite sex. However, they make certain assumptions along with that, namely, that someone who is heterosexual is not capable of being sexually attracted to or enjoying any sort of sexual activity with the same sex. 


Basically, you won't convince people who know about this that you're straight, because you don't fit neatly within the assumptions they make about heterosexuality. BUT you may be able to make them realize the situation isn't so black and white, i.e. that you're not gay. It's not likely to be a winning strategy, because some people will think you must be in denial, but challenge their assumptions. Try explaining it as: ""Okay, I like sex. I'm not picky about who sucks me off, and sometimes, I'm courteous and curious enough to return the favor. However, I don't find men sexually attractive, and I have no desire to date another man or any need to repeat the experience. I AM sexually attracted to women, and I DO want to have sex with them. Is that what gay means to you?"""

"Just to back you up, chronic binge drinking is considered a form alcoholism and does the same amount of damage to one's body as drinking a lesser amount daily would.  It's often more helpful to look at how much one drinks on a weekly or monthly basis than nightly when assessing whether or not they have a problem. That's why most doctors will inquire about drinking habits by asking how many drinks per week or month you have. Overall trends are important. "

"&gt;Every time we argue about this he just thinks I don't care about how much skiing means to him. Part of me gets it but part of me thinks hes just being selfish.

It can totally be both! It sounds like you understand why he'd spend HIS time, money, and driving effort on skiing, but don't agree that you should spend YOURS on it too. When the budget got tight and he lost his license, he unilaterally decided that the thing you (as a couple) would cut back on to accommodate those changes wasn't going to be his thing. 

I'm sure after 7 years you understand and respect his passion, but I don't think he quite gets that you're a team now and sometimes his passion will be the thing to take a hit when money or time are tight.

One suggestion: if you have this argument yearly, can you make a budget for the winter a few months in advance, and agree to stick to it instead of renegotiating when it snows? Would he stick to it even if it meant cutting back because uber fare or something pushes him over the limit? "

"If it happened, it happened because she was going to miscarry anyhow. None of those things induce miscarriage in any way shape or form. Sunflower seeds help raise your progesterone, which helps a pregnancy. Vitamin C is protective for the immune system.

"Irregularity is normal in teenagers. 

Encourage her to install a period tracker app and track her cycle so that she starts seeing the patterns/non patterns. I'm 19 and my cycle is irregular- bleeding small amounts daily for 5 days is a period. Sometimes I use supers every 3-4 hours but other times it's literally just lights and panty liners because again we are teens and it is not regular. Some periods can come super fast, others can go slow. Spotting can happen whenever unfortunately. Brown discharge means it is just a little old and took a bit to come out, is normal. Red means it is new and went out fast. Like the tortoise and the hare. Clumps are also normal.

Ovarian pain could be anything but most likely it is her feeling something known as ovulation, it tends to happen ~two weeks after a period (at least for me, again, everyone is different) and if she did have a second period during that five day period a week after the 3rd (i.e. from the 10th to the 14th of December) and then start feeling the pain on the 4th of January, that is likely ovulation. Pain lasts around a day normally. Additionally, it could just be a cramp or something of that nature- I have IBS/lactose intolerance and often times my stomach is unsettled and creates pain similar to pain during menstruation. 

I think it would benefit both of you a lot to watch some educational videos about periods (especially you) so that you know what is normal and what isn't. It is good that she is going to the doctor so she will be able to know if there are any irregularities and because well all girls should go to a gynecologist to ensure everything is golden there. 

And finally, her mom is full of it. Doctors cannot tell your parents you are having sex, that is a HIPPA violation and you can #rek him if he does. Additionally, there is really no guaranteed way to know if a patient is having sex unless they say ""hey I am having sex"" or they are actually pregnant. Hymen breaking as a kid is normal and some women aren't even born with them. Just encourage her to lie/say it's none of the mom's business and be deadfaced, she'll never know unless the daughter breaks down. It's none of her business. Just ensure she goes to get a pap smear and all the other good stuff that she should have already had done around her age and that shes checked out as all good and encourage her to ask questions about her body/period that she has concerns about. It'll likely be a huge relief to her (and to you.)

"I think you went wrong by framing it as a ""business decision"" and emphasizing this throughout. Then it makes it just a ""business decision"" for them to insist on changing stuff.

Seems entirely sensible. I would recommend to anyone that they cohabitate for a while before getting engaged. Living together is when you really get to see all sides of a person.
This comment keeps getting thrown out in random threads now. It's just really not that simple and does not work for the vast majority of relationships. It's really not a helpful comment. 
"She is a SAHM. Mostly we have good days, but having twins with so many other young kids is rough at times. I know she's exhausted, but I try to take as much off her as I can, but it's hard when I'm at work for most of the day, especially lately when all 5 have been home together with her. "
"Does she have hobbies or any purpose outside of motherhood? What did she do with her alone time? I'm not saying you aren't trying, you're here, which shows caring. 

I just know that my parents have two very different ideas of my childhood. My dad swears he was there all the time, gave my mom all sorts of help, but that's not what mom (or us kids) usually remember. Not because he didn't care, or try, or love us, but because he has no concept of what being a stay at home parent is. He never had us for a week straight, never had to be on 24/7. It's emotionally and physically draining. He remembers the fun and it seems so significant, we do too but it was a bright point in a long week without him. All people loving and trying, but vastly different perspectives.

I'll echo everyone else, counseling. While you might not have meant to, women are often pressured to ""give your husband a boy"", and actively voicing that you wanted one could have put extra pressure on her that you might not have understood. Or she is suffering from PPD. Or pure exhaustion. So many ways this could have developed, and associated resentments, a professional is the best way to go at this point. "

Does he not realize that in most accidents if he's not wearing a seatbelt he's going to go flying through the window or out the windshield?

If you want to keep the relationship maybe visit her in her lair 1/week, with the expectation she will visit you, either in your home or somewhere like a small quiet cafe, 1/week too. Do not give in to ""let's just watch a movie at my place"". Nope. She gets 1 visit that panders to her ""issue"" and that's it. "

"This. There will be people out there who will date you even if you're trans, and you're better off spending your energy looking for someone who would be excited to have you as a girlfriend, not pining over a guy who has already told you it would be a no."
"It's your age and location. Most couples with children have limited time available to spend with couple friends and individual friends of the same gender so most people limit their socializing to an established small group. You guys arrived in a small town and have discovered that most people whom you would naturally socialize with already have a few couples they can get together with and a few men or women they can call on if they need a friend of the same gender. Their roster is full so to speak. They all say it'd be nice to get together because they think you and your wife are great and would enjoy it but their habits are formed in terms of the same people whom they ring up (almost on autopilot) when asking other couples/friends to get together. 
The answer is to break this habit and the way to do this is to do the grunt work of the socializing:

1) become the couple that always volunteers to host school events: class Christmas party, end of year drinks, etc. The more you guys become the couple who hosts events the better. It will train the other parents to see you in a social light.
2) organize a monthly girls night. Have your wife invite all mums over for wine the third Thursday of every month to have a laugh and a glass of wine while cracking jokes about the kids and husbands. 
3) organize a monthly pub night for all the men you know. Try to have it connect to a trivia night or do a billiards tournament or something and the prize is a case of beer (which you provide). These types of monthly events remove the vague aspect of when to meet up...no more ""mate let's get a beer some time"". Instead it's ""you coming to trivia Tuesday this month? What about next month?""
4) Arrange a kid socializing event in a public area once a month and invite everyone you know with children. Eg. Sunday afternoon we're having a water balloon fight on the village green. Bring your kids! Make it seasonal. Eg. We rented rink time at the local ice rink on Saturday morning. Bring your kids! This allows parents to have their kids be entertained while you chat and bond.
5) organize a quirky event for parents like a fancy dress/ costume party; or one of those How to Host a Murder dinner parties where everyone arrives in character. 
6) host a parent plus kids party for every holiday: Halloween, Christmas, etc. Chocolate egg hunt at your place for Easter.

The fact is that its a hassle to clean your house so it's presentable for guests and can be costly to host bbqs etc where you're buying food and alcohol. Many people can't be asked to do this. Also it takes work to organize pub nights etc, so again people don't be bothered. If you and your wife commit to always being the planners and always being the hosts for one year, people will get on board and you'll have changed the way people think in terms of going out or inviting in. Good luck!"

If your wife can't understand what your going thru, and deal with supporting you then she isn't  the one for you.

Do I tell them I did and just let them abuse me guilt me? Or just kind of ignore it?"

 Maybe something like this

 ""I have been feeling that our relationship has been pretty rocky recently and I couldn't help noticing that you've been in touch with X a lot during the past few weeks, which I guess is a symptom that you may be feeling the same way. I think we should talk about our feelings towards each other right now as honestly as we can and see if there is any way we can work on this marriage.

I don't think that's something OP really needs to be concerned about: I had a friend whose parents did this, and she and her brother both wound up closer to the other parent than the one whose name they each got for entirely unrelated reasons.  But if OP's fiance isn't interested, then it's a nonstarter in her situation.  What she needs to focus on is getting *him* to articulate why he's suddenly digging in his heels over something he claims shouldn't be that big a deal.  Hopefully the counseling will help, because this is a bad omen for his conflict-solving skills over the course of the marriage."
"By the time she found this out she was in the deep stages of an abusive relationship.

"We talked about it many times. I kept bringing it up because that's how hurt i was and i now realize that was very unfair. He told me time and time and again, he only did it because she put him against the wall and manipulated him into getting what she wanted. I'd never do that to him. Plus he has been with me longer, we have done way more things together than he has done with anybody else, and in his own way he has done things for me/with me he never did ever! Also their relationship ended badly. He got her to move to the US, filed for fiance visa and everything, and a month after being here she tells him she is in love with somebody else and that he is coming to pick her up. And that the reason she didn't flew straight into town was because she stayed with that guy a couple of days before, on her way there. "
"This is kinda genius. Let them *think* it might happen so they don't act like total fools during the event, then shut it down. What are they going to do, call their relatives and whine that their (the relatives) gifts didn't go to them (the parents)?

But, I would add, I would make sure the person in charge of the groom's bag is either physically intimidating, or super well-respected (like a grandfather) such that the parents would not try to snatch it from that person. If Op has a sister or can get her mom on board, tell MIL, ""Oh my mom/sister is going to catalog who the gifts came from, so both bags are going to her house."""
"to be fair, that was almost certainly with a frozen embryo."

"Why would it be a shame for him to cut ties with people so selfish they are prepared to disown him unless he takes over their responsibilties and not get an education? His parents issued the ultimatum, they can deal with the consequences."
"it doesn't sound like he's shutting it down, though?  then he's getting shitty with OP by saying 'fine, I won't go since you think I'm a cheater'. That's not one bit productive, and not how one should be acting toward their SO if they really do have good intentions. He should be telling the others to STFU about sleeping with anyone else, as he's in a committed relationship, and he should be reassuring her.  
Honestly u/badfeelingtrip I'd be unhappy also."
"Dude no, this isn't normal for someone who claims to love you to do things they know hurt you, and it's at minimum disrespectful to coerce or guilt you into sex. You don't owe him sex just because he paid for a date. 

You need to talk to him and tell him he needs to stop doing things that physically hurt you, and that you don't like feeling pressured into sex, at the very least. Personally, I'd break up with him because if he's delighting in hurting you, that's abusive."

"&gt;I am working with Aimi [my personal therapist] to mitigate my anxiety, and in return, Jack needs to let go of the resentment.

Why the F are you ""working towards mitigating your anxiety??"" Sometimes I want to slap some therapists upside the head. YOU SHOULD HAVE ANXIETY!!!!! You're being constantly screamed at by a raging drunk while you cry on the floor!!! You live with a man who has told you that HE IS INTENTIONALLY ABUSING AND TORTURING YOU!!!! You watch him drink bottles of whiskey every day.

IT IS NORMAL TO HAVE ANXIETY IN THIS SITUATION!!!!!!!!!!!!

It would be abnormal for you not to have anxiety in this situation!!!! Please don't spend anymore time ""working"" on your anxiety. This is akin to getting shot by a bullet and going to the doctor every week to ""work on"" not feeling any pain. While ignoring the bullet!!!!

You know, pain can be a very good thing and a gift because it helps us stay safe. It's dangerous not to feel pain because we don't know when we're being injured. There are people who have disorders where they do not feel any pain, and those people frequently injure themselves very badly, especially as children.

Fear and anxiety is the same!!!! Anxiety tells us when we are in a DANGEROUS, scary, unhealthy, and bad situation!!!! Don't try to stuff down your anxiety! It is normal and healthy and you are feeling it for a reason!!! You just need to get OUT of the bad situation!!!

I read that you ended your email with this:

&gt;This relationship has damaged me to a point of no return, emotionally. I can't have a relationship with a normal person now. Jack is my only option.

Even if it were true that you were damaged to a point of no return (I think that's very unlikely), that still does not mean that Jack is your only option. You still have the option to be single. And it's SO MUCH BETTER to be single than be with someone that tortures you on purpose with loathing towards you!!! Why can't you be single? I have a feeling being single would actually turn out to be an enormous relief!

---------
Okay I read your edit how not being in the relationship also gives you anxiety. And you asked how to break the cycle. You need to break the cycle by getting rid of your LEGITIMATE sources of anxiety first, and then working on the irrational sources of anxiety that remain. This means breaking up with him and getting into a non-abusive housing situation first, and then working on the rest.

Let me tell you something. You will not be able to change Jack. You will not be able to make this relationship work. Jack does not want it to work. It sounds like he just wants out. You won't change that.  It will get worse and worse until he seriously harms you, or he just dumps you, and then what? 

Also.... have you ever talked to your therapist about BPD? Ask her if she thinks dialectical behavior therapy might be helpful for you after you exit this relationship. "
This is gold right here
"Before you contact anyone you need to talk to the owner of the dog. If he works long shifts (night or day depending on when the dog is crying) it might be that the dog has severe separation anxiety and that the owner doesn't know about. For example I sometimes wonder how long my dog cries after I leave (I live in apartments). If he doesn't seem concerned, doesn't care, or if the situation doesn't improve, then go ahead and contact the landlord. Also definitely mention how you would appreciate if he picked up after his dog. If things don't improve then go ahead and contact management. Hope everything gets sorted out and that the doggie is okay. "
"I understand that it isn't a transaction. I know that she doesn't owe me anything, and I try my best to not get frustrated or put pressure on her. That isn't something I would be okay with either. if that's how she treated me.

We do have fun. We both enjoy spending time together whenever we can, and we laugh constantly. Dates don't always end in sex, nor are they expected to.

The issue is not that she ""isn't fulfilling her wifely duties"" or some sort of equally archaic complaint, it's that I have a real need that I don't feel is being considered. I apologize if the tone of my previous comment was overly brusque. 


As far as experience goes, I will concede that point. Sex is important to me though, and I have spent the last four years trying to get good at it. I read the most reputable material I can on the subject, and focus on her pleasure. The whole ""sha-bang"" as I called it often involves putting on her favorite mood-music (we talked about it, and I know what does it for her), candles, bubble baths, and bubbly. The duration of foreplay is dictated by her, and I (and her) do the things that she likes. I know this because I've asked her what she likes. She always orgasms at least once, often soon after foreplay, and usually does two or three times.

I understand where you are coming from, as my initial reaction was also that she just must not be enjoying it enough, or I must not be doing it right, but please don't think that I am some slob. The sex is good, and that is what makes this all the more confusing for me."
"Sorry, I'll with your folks here - even though I understand that it makes your financial situation harder.

A few other options:

- can you carpool with others?
- can you buy a bicycle to go to and from work?

Can you do a job from work? For instance, JetBlue used to hire SAHMs to be their customer service reps and they could work from home.  A few years ago, IBM told all of its employees to work from home to save on office bills.  Take a look at the career subreddits for legit work-from-home jobs. 

Good luck!"
"OP, my advice is to go ride the trains and find some places to apply to work that you *can* get transportation to.  A college graduate working 28 hrs a week for $10 an hour seems seriously underemployed to me.  Take a notebook (or that fancy phone) and make lots of notes about businesses are  within walking distance of the train stations.  Do the math as to what and where is the most logical place for you to work.  "
"yeah, I live in an area where it's required by law for the wife to keep her maiden name when she gets married, which means that all mothers and children here don't share surnames. the most trouble it's caused is when someone at an international airport does like a double take maybe? but usually we hand our passports all together as a family anyway. it doesn't cause so many challenges!"
"It's very difficult for many people to provide the best condolences to such an unthinkable loss. I am religious so in such a case, I would be apt to send my thoughts and prayers as well as a casserole dish/food;  exhaust such a loss is unimaginable. 

I can't imagine be pain you are going through. And the anger is a rightful response. I would be slightly more diplomatic to your friends (perhaps in a social media post): ""We appreciate all the support and love provided by all of our friends and family in recent weeks. However, we can not cope with the repeated messages that our dear son is now in heaven. This does little to lessen our pain nor sadness, though you are free to continue to pray for him. We will never forget our son and it means a lot that we have received such a multitude of support.""

That said, if someone refuses to hear ""thank you for your support and thoughts, but your sentiment is very hard to hear as a parent who wanted their son besides them;"" then I would be more forceful. 

I'm sorry for your loss. I can't even imagine your pain. "
"Neither. Is it so hard to believe that he can be both afraid of what Tony might do - particularly since he hasn't seen him in many years so he has no idea if the behavior has escalated or not - and that he would invite his brother to his wedding, which had security and other people there?

What is so hard to reconcile between, ""I theoretically want a relationship with my estranged, possibly mentally ill brother if he's nonviolent,"" and ""But I also want to protect myself in case that same mentally ill brother *is still violent*""?

I frequent relationships (I'm a lurker), and I feel like this kind of confrontational, black-and-white thinking is what really gets this sub its reputation. My husband is simultaneously capable of worrying about his brother and where he is and what's happening to him, *and* being afraid of him, *and* being fed up with my MIL's lying. It doesn't mean *he* is lying about his intentions. It means that this is a really complex situation. Which is why I asked for advice on it. I've gone to great pains to emphasize that my husband is more than willing to honor NC, and that he's afraid of his brother because as of right now, he's Schrodinger's Violent Person. We have no idea of what he will do and how he will act when he eventually does resurface, and it's seemingly increasingly likely that will be after the shield of MIL is gone, so it would be helpful to know what to anticipate."

"I wonder how your wife would present this same scenario. From reading your post and your subsequent comments here, it sounds like you checked out of the relationship a long time ago. 

Many people, unfortunately, go into a marriage expecting either that 1) now that they have their love ""locked down"" they won't have to put much effort into the relationship or 2) that their significant other will finally change and become a better person for them. It sounds like your wife made the second assumption and you made the first. She expected more out of you, and she became resentful and frusrated when you didn't do more and in fact, over time, did less. You didn't expect to have to work to keep the relationship as good as it was. You resented her, she resented you, and finally, you cheated. Where that could have been a turning point for the both of you as a couple, it wasn't. Cheating wasn't just your outlet, it was your out. You did it because part of you really didn't want to be bothered anymore. Your wife continues to try to get you to care about what she wants you to care about, and you continue avoiding trying to put any real effort into saving the relationship. 

If you're not going to even TRY and save your relationship, quit wasting your wife's time. Considering she's stuck with you through cheating and you not following along with your therapy program, she seems like someone who's determined to make it work - and maybe if you were trying harder, including communicating to the therapist that you feel ganged up on and that you don't feel capable of doing certain things for your wife - maybe you two could make it work. But really, if you don't want it to, it never will."
Thank you for the advice about background checking the shit out of people. I will certainly keep that in mind.
"I'm not sure how it was before kids or for your first kid but it sounds like he just isn't being empathetic to your situation, something many men (including I) struggle with. Have a talk with him and tell him all about what you did that day and ask him how he thinks you feel. Begin asking him how he thinks you feel after situations. That's what helps me anyways as a person lacking empathy.



If he just doesn't get it, I advice a couples therapist. If he does, great. Time to compromise. An example would be out of his 4 days off, he gets a day off (except to help here and there because you're pregnant), you get a day off, then you both help each other out (and/or go on a date) the other days. When was the last time you guys went out for fun? Is there anyone in the area you trust to watch your kids? When was the last time you went out with friends?"

And days before calling it off, he insisted it was happening! Who wouldn't be surprised or disappointed by the sudden (and blamey) way he called it off? What a way to show someone how much they mean to you."
"I don't think you *can* diffuse the conflict. I understand her point of view and why this is hurtful to her, but breakups hurt and you're not obligated to make your choices while thinking about her. From her point of view, she wanted you to make X change, you failed, then she left and you're making the positive changes that you didn't make before. She doesn't realize that the changes she's making aren't about her at all, but about you learning from experience and improving yourself. Still, she likely feels like you wouldn't do this for her, like she wasn't worth it, and now you are doing it for yourself or someone else.

She also likely can't even begin to imagine dating, and doesn't understand that people cope with grief and pain in quite different ways. ""Moving on quickly"" really doesn't say anything about how you felt in the relationship, but she feels that it must.

Practically speaking, the best you can do is ""I'm sorry you feel that way. I've tried to make the best of the situation"" or something like that. Go low or no contact. Don't try to justify or explain your actions, they aren't her business and you don't owe her an explanation, and there isn't one that will satisfy her."
Agreed!
"&gt; Other adults won't work. 

There are adults that will help you - teachers, doctors, school counselors, administrators. They're both empowered to intervene on your behalf and *required* to do so when you tell them about how you're being treated.

Go to a teacher you trust and tell them that you think your parents might be abusive. They're trained on how to handle this and how to intervene safely and effectively; it was a condition of their professional license.

&gt; All the adults in the family have been present when mom does stuff, even physical stuff, and think it's my fault.

Obviously - they're the ones who raised your mom this way, so of course they think it's ok. But they're wrong - they abused your mom, and now she abuses you. It's a cycle that you can stop, though."

""How can I get my bf, who is completely lacking in redeeming qualities and is otherwise an utter waste of a human life to meet the barest standards of human decency. I am not looking to leave him, because that would make way to much sense so the only advice I am looking for is a way to make someone change their base, core behaviour, which we all know is impossible. I would also like to keep enabling his bad behaviour because god forbid this man is responsible for any of his actions or words.""

"All relationships require work to maintain. Sure you have the honeymoon phase that everyone has where things are just easy, but eventually things get hard. If you're not willing to do things when times get hard, then you're not with the right person. If you're willing to put in the work to keep a relationship in a healthy state, then you're with the right person.

The thing I think you're hung up on is whether or not you actually want children. If you do want children, and you're with the right person, then I think you're just having cold feet. If you're not sure you want children, and she definitely does, then you need to discuss this with her. Reddit is going to tell you to leave her, but that's really up to you.

I think you need to do some soul searching to decide what you want out of life. Figure out what *you* want, and then you'll know if you're with the right person or not."
"Everyone has different taste in tattoos.  It doesn't sound like your wife disapproves of the action itself, just that your tattoo choice isn't her favorite.  She has to recognize that this is a personal-taste kind of thing.  You should get what you want.

"I'm so sorry. I would be furious with Fiona.

One thing you will learn is that some people really do not have manners. You and I would never, EVER consider pushing someone's boundaries like that. No doubt that's why you've let her slide so many times - because every time she stomped on your boundaries, part of you was thinking ""She can't be for real. It must be a mistake, because no one treats other people like that. No one is that dense."" And you will learn that yes, people ARE that dense, and rude, and selfish. 

So from now on, tell Fiona no. She is NOT allowed to use your things. LAbel your things. ""This belongs to Magdalena996, DO NOT USE"". And if she uses it, she literally cannot say ""Oh, I thought I could use it"" - it was on the label. And you can say ""That costs $11.99, you can write me a check, I'll wait here while you get your checkbook. I could not have been more clear with the label on the item. You deliberately used it knowing I did not want you to and now I need you to pay for it."" 

And yes, keep everything in your room now. She'll take without asking. 
 
No more helping. 

If she says ""Hey, can I use your pan?"" you will have to say ""No, you can't."" Don't apologize. She'll act upset, and that's fine. Don't explain or justify. Just say ""No, you can't use it."" The issue is that you have been too nice, and she has taken that to mean she can steamroll you, and now you need to go in the other direction because she can't be trusted. 

It sucks, and I am sorry. Roommates are hell."

&gt; Well, why does anyone get married? It ritualizes the commitment between the couple, it gives legality to the relationship, all things I want for the both of us. There are people who get married and don't want kids at all. Why do they get married then? 

Look, I totally get that, I'm getting married in the summer and we don't want kids for 5 years at least.  I'm not saying don't get married at all, I'm just saying there's no need to rush.  You seem to be very caught up in this idealized, romantic version of marriage when in reality it's the every day nitty-gritty stuff that bog people down in marriage.  Bills, chores, holidays, pets, kids, job stress, career decisions- how will you know how you will work through these things as a couple if you have never lived together?"

This is an example of manipulation. 

Okay, I'm 29 years old, just like this guy. The age gap is whatever, but the life experience is massive in my opinion. My SO is 31 years old, and I love the fact that we are on the same page with life experiences (more or less). At your age, you don't have a lot of the life experiences that your fiancé has. You don't see that he is 'emotionally manipulating' you because of the lack of your experiences. 

&gt; Could this also be a problem because of our wedding? I mean, it is a big day for both of us. 

No. People don't just turn this on or off; this is how they are. You need to ask yourself some serious questions here moving forward. Do you want to be with someone who manipulates you?

"I feel like you make this sound a lot harder than it actually is. I'm in a similar position and if you just mention something that hints at it without making a big deal out of it, when the topic NATURALLY comes up somehow, then it should be fine. I don't go out of my way to LIE or HIDE things, but I may not mention something unless it's relevant to the current topic. It can certainly be awkward but I think if you ACT like it's awkward your partner may feel offended: ""why would you feel like that's worth hiding from me?"" ""why would you think I'd care so much that you'd have to make a BIG REVEAL"" etc. 

It's definitely weird if you hide that kind of thing from an SO for an ENTIRE YEAR. I'd be pretty mortified if someone I was intimate with for that long hid something like that from me. At a year in I think I know you and everything about you. I've met your family. I'd also feel ESPECIALLY insulted if I was already making 6 figures. Someone making 6 figures is no stranger to money.

"&gt; one friend who married his partner within a year. My bf mentioned that this was unusually short and why wouldn't he wait to be sure since the divorce rate is so high? 

Your bf's thoughts here are rational and right. To get married to someone without going onto a full year of the relationship is pretty reckless and imo, stupid. It very rarely works out in the favour of the couple and can be a huge money sink.

He didn't explicitly say he's opting out of marriage, just leaning towards it. That being said, you should still respect his stance if he's made it clear. If you feel like your conflicting future goals will be an issue, maybe now's the time to talk about where you two see your future with or without each other.

&gt; However, because it is still very early stages, I wouldn't feel comfortable discussing it because I'd feel silly.

?? Why get into a relationship with someone who you don't feel comfortable having hard conversations with? When would be the appropriate time, you think? Six months, a year? I think you should just talk to him and tell him what you're looking for as of **now**. If you're expecting long-term with marriage in mind, then maybe this isn't the right relationship for either of you. "

While part of why you go to funerals is to support people like friends, a big part of it is just paying your respects to someone you knew. One person in particular was like 'she didn't even try to get in touch afterwards' but maybe her friend wasn't there for her, but for her dad. Doesn't mean she has to want to be bff's again if she shows up. *shrugs*

My uncle recently died and I noticed that his daughters ex showed up. He sat in the back and didn't intrude. Obviously just wanted to pay his respects to a man he'd known for years. I don't think that's such an odd thing to do. When my grandma died a whole bunch of people who'd divorced out of the family came and I honestly didn't think too much about it. They weren't intrusive. Whatever.

But then again, grief does odd things to people."
"What kind of loss? Is this.. an aunt he never spoke to, or the grandmother he ate Sunday dinner with for the last 15 years?

If it's a **significant loss**, consider that he's oblivious. He's too absorbed in the loss to even think about giving you credit for trying. He's just too sad to be even a little bit happy. I hope that makes sense."
Because my name was fist on the list...
"Holy shit, dude. I'm so sorry for everything you're going through. Words from an internet stranger may not be much help right now, but my heart truly aches after reading your post.

Firstly: anyone suggesting you ""get over"" the loss of a child is a shitbag of the absolute lowest order. That's not something you get over, ever. Not only losing a loved one, but one so young, who should have had her whole future ahead of her -- I can't even imagine how hard that is.

Your sisters sound like some of the most awful people I've read about on this sub, and that's saying something. You know, I've met some nasty, racist, bigoted jerks in my time, who STILL managed to pull it together enough to be civil and decent when a tragedy struck, like a death in the family.

For your own health and sanity, do it. Move, and cut ties. Don't bother to ever speak to your sisters again.

I understand you are more conflicted about your nieces and nephews. How old are they? If they're old enough and can be trusted, you could give them an email or phone number to stay in touch, but only if they won't hand it straight to their parents.

But the bottom line is this: your obligation to yourself and to your own health comes first. Don't sacrifice that for your siblings' children.

I hope the new year brings you change and healing, in your own time. Grieve for your beautiful girl, move, leave the toxic people behind and find your true family -- the people who will love you and care about you for who you are. They're out there, somewhere.

Blessings and internet hugs &lt;3

"I suppose I should have been more specific, but I did state in my post that we have sex at least once a week. He gets oral once or twice a week. 

To be a bit more specific about my autoimmune disease, I have an inflammatory bowel disease and often cannot have sex or even straighten up my body due to intense cramping and explosive diarrhea. Endometriosis also makes sex extremely painful for me and causes bleeding during/after unless we take our time.  "
His words and actions have consequences.
"Attraction to things outside your reach isn't nessesarily in the same ballpark though. Sometimes it has more to do with a ""grass is always greener"" issue where you are unhappy with where you are and it makes the things outside your influence much more attractive. If he left his wife an pursued these women he says he's attracted to, he very well may find once the deed is acheiveable that he isn't as into it as he thought.

He says his wife is objectively quite attractive, so why would he be ""repulsed""? It sounds like he isn't acknowledging something about himself, and I'd be willing to be he is unsatisfied with other key areas of his like beyond just his attraction to his wife."
"&gt; but I'm not sure how to do it without being accusatory.

Something along the lines of:
""Hey, I've been feeling a little insecure and anxious about our relationship recently and want to talk about it.""

The logical response would be him wanting to talk more about why you're feeling this way. Hopefully this opens the dialogue and you can talk more about his private phone usage (not the content) and about this coworker."
"&gt;Trust your husband more than ever.

This is the most important part! Only he has the ability to deny, refuse, and avoid.

"In my world, 2 years is still pretty quick. Not uncommon or anything, but most married people in my circles were together for at least 4-5 years before getting engaged. Definitely agreed that it should be discussed though. All about your perspective."

This made me cry. Thank you for posting it.

This guy sounds worse as she comments."
She doesn't want you and never will.

"Thank you. I have seen a couple people post something similar and I think I will start this. It makes pick up quicker\easier for me, and I don't have to bother him with it just then. This is exactly what I was looking for!"
"Yup, I'm currently with a guy like this and I want out. I can't keep up with his progressive need for more and more odd and elaborate crap. I just want sex, not to prepare for some sick 3 hour porn scene. Sigh."
"Agreeing with this. My wife likes to 'snoop', but she's upfront about it (and why she does it) and I've made it clear to her that I don't mind and she can discuss those things with me. I'm not a super private person to start with, and sometimes her nosiness is helpful (reminding me about things I forgot, bringing up important topics for discussion, etc)."
"From another comment, the OP clarifies that they're close enough friends that she invited him to her super-intimate birthday celebration (just him, one other friend, and her parents), she also invited him to Thanksgiving, he's met her family many times, and her parents like him. This is not a case of him simply being an acquaintance on a train, which I think is an important detail. 

But yes, he did overreact to a white lie which shouldn't have mattered *that* much. It hurts to be lied to, and I think that's the underlying issue he's struggling with, but he really does have to just let it go. "
"Your views don't matter. She doesn't want him to watch porn (and considering his cycle I would be worried about him watching porn anyway). She asked him not to, he said he wouldn't. Then he watched porn again.

Everyone has lines in the sand. This is hers. If he doesn't want to adhere to it then they need to rehash the conversation or leave. "
"Don't ask anymore. When she starts following you, stand in one spot with your dog and stare her down. If she doesn't get the fuck out, say ""GET AWAY FROM ME OR I'LL CALL THE COPS.""

repeat. Call the cops if you have to. She's psycho and she's harassing you.
"
"Thanks for your reply. Yeah, I'm definitely excited to see him, as he is with me. I tried to keep it logical because of course the emotional part is saying ""yeah, move in!"" But it's also early, and what if we both make a rash decision. Or what if the financial problems cause strain on the relationship. On the flip side, I've also had several friends suggest he just move in rather than have tenants. "
"NO.  no co-signing!  ever! then OP is on the hook for that debt, with interest and penalties, at the risk of OP's own credit, when coworker inevitably doesn't pay - not to mention the fact that it will show as debt on HIS credit report even if dude DOES pay.  (which he wouldn't.)

 he'd be better off just giving him the ten thousand.  at least that way there's no FICO score/interest/penalties to worry about.  seriously OP do not do this."

"I was the other girl once in a very similar situation [coincidentally, I met him at a concert for one of my favorite bands].

"They're probably trying to preserve the friendship.

"$3,900 in 1992 is almost $7,000 when adjusted for inflation. Definitely a large enough sum to put yourself in danger with that type of person. I have heard of people being killed for less than that. "
"Thing is though it does solve the problem of this happening in the first place. They were close friends and she got a little too close to him and stepped over the line, she stepped into your marriage and invaded it. This only happened not because you let them go out for drinks but because she got too comfortable with him, it could of happened anywhere and any time."
"&gt; She was very upset and seemed genuinely remorseful

I would say best case scenario she found it awkward to bring up. Remorseful would have been her telling you it was a mistake, cutting off all contact and answering all questions truthfully and submitting to your requests/demands. I think it was awkward for her, like coming out gay to your parents or something. Nothing of what you described suggested remorse.

&gt; wouldn't answer when I asked if she loved him.

Because she does and she probably finds it an awkward topic of conversation to have with you. She was probably hoping you would just initiate divorce so she could get back to business with the other guy.

It is quite clear that your marriage is over. A one night stand you could recover from. Having an emotional and physical affair for months? It shows just how low you and your children rate for her. She made a decision a long time ago, she's just letting you know."
She has a reason to be mad but that doesnt give her a right to harrass him via text. She needs to swallow the decision that SHE made. That was her choice and any anger she feels should be kept to herself.
"May I suggest that instead of a girlfriend, you get a therapist and a lawyer? A therapist will help you personally determine if you want to salvage this. I understand if you want to work on your marriage, but for all you know her next bombshell might be I'm leaving you and taking everything. So please also talk to a divorce lawyer, just in case. Don't let her blindside you if it comes to it. 

ETA- Also, ask yourself when the last time you felt truly happy and respected in this marriage. From what you've written here, it seems like your wife isn't respecting you at all and is staying as a means of a safety net. "
"Unfortunately there is not much you can do about bad parenting in this situation. But if I were you, I'd tell them that you're not interested in babysitting anymore until or unless he gets his act together. At a minimum if you are babysitting they need to respect your disciplining, but it's probably best to back off altogether. If they visit you, tell them you reserve the right to ask their family to leave if things get out of control. It's awkward, but an unfortunate reality. "
"You are not available for the date of the hens party that she insisted on setting up, and organizing, at a moment's notice without your input.  You need to tell the bride, ""Sorry, but I'm not available which I would have happily told you if you had waited a bit longer for me to reply.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend.  I'm sure the rest of your attendants will be happy to help out and you'll all have a great time!"". And then you need to drop the rope on anything related to the hens party.  

Because the bride isn't supposed to organize, and throw, her own hens party.  And if she is involved in the planning, she shouldn't set the plans in stone and start inviting people before her attendants confirm that they can be there, and that they can help (with decorations, costs, etc.).

Your bride sounds like she's got OCD or something.  She's being very micromanaging.

You should definitely NOT change your other plans.  If she wanted you there, she could have waited 24 hours for you (and her other attendants) to get back to her before she firmed up the plans.  Make a stand.  ""I have other plans of long-standing with other friends.  I am not going to change those plans.""

I don't think this is the last issue you'll have with this bride.  She needs to calm the heck down."
Except if you say this then you're downplaying everything 
"It's completely within your rights to bring up his behavior again.  Let him know it's not a jealousy issues, so much as it is you really think he has some sort of attraction to her and you're no longer comfortable hanging out with her."
"Poor kitty! I have no suggestions SIL-wise, but you should take 30 mins to setup a webcam / an old cellphone cam on wifi in the house before you go on your next trip. I use the Albert app, but there are tons of options on any platform. Mine has motion detection and sends me texts with video clips when the cats do certain things.

 I did this because my friend paid another friend to stay in his house and take care of his two dogs while he was gone for 2 weeks. They claimed everything was fine on the phone and they were with the dogs. But they never once showed up to feed/walk/water the dogs. If he hadn't installed cameras and checked them, the dogs likely would have died. 

Obviously way lower key with cats as they basically take care of themselves. But I have a cam on the food/water and a cam on the litterbox so I can easily monitor the situation."
"There is so much going on here that is unhealthy. Basically, you two need to not be with each other. Not together, not friends, no contact at all. She is definitely not your girlfriend if she is making out with and going home with a guy in front of you. Hell, she is not a friend if she is basically abandoning you to hang out with strangers for the night. Cut it off. Don't reach out to her. Move on."
"Actually while we're on protecting yourselves your family should have as much info private as possible. Private phone numbers, po box listed as mailing address, etc. To protect them from this kind of harassment. Plan for the worst, hope for the best. "

"Agree with others - that's just normal denial and alcoholism. He's not trying to make you think you're crazy, he doesn't realize at all that his behavior should be concerning.

It doesn't mean that either thing is ""worse"" - they're both bad. They both are unhealthy to be around. They're just not the same thing."
"She said she didn't want to hook up anymore, you said that you wanted to try to be friends.

Yet the next time you cuddled with her and then poured your heart out to her again.  Of course she is going to be turned off you deceived her when you said you wanted to still be friends.  And then you sent a gift when she clearly doesn't want to talk to you.  You need to chill.  Move on with your life and let her live hers."
"1)it's your leg hair. just empty the tub next time instead of being a wuss. why you fought him over that i don't get but it comes off as really immature.

2)that being said, run like the fucking wind from him. seriously, all he should see is a dust trail. what he did was very abusive and he could have hurt you severely. that's a ridiculous way to act over someone not wanting to empty a tub. if you had smashed your head you could have drowned if you went unconscious(cause he doesn't sound like he would have helped you out if it had happened). if he's this way over tub water this will get worse, not better. leave him before you become even more of a statistic.

"This whole post is confusing.  
You're upset that you don't have friends.  Women want to be your friend.  But they aren't good enough for your friendship so you have no friends.  

You love fashion, urban culture and a huge capitol city.  But you went to school in another state that's more associated with agriculture and are now upset that the other students mostly come from a rural background.  

You want to pursue your passion in the fashion industry so you became a chemical engineer...I'm going to just stop there. 
YOU are the problem here.  You are a bad friend because you don't want girls in your circle unless you can have sex with them otherwise they are not worthy of your friendship.  You should have applied at a college in a more urban area regardless of your grades you'd be surprised what they will still accept.  You should have picked a school with a heavy fashion or art program.  
The good news is, this can still be fixed.  You can put aside the childish notion that you need a certain number for friends with penises and be friends with girls who probably share your interests.  You can transfer to a school inside or near Chicago.  There are great schools with great fashion programs like FIT in NY so you can make plans to transfer or eventually go there.    "
"Im 21, I have a 4yo son. Heres my opinion. 

It sounds like your stepson hasn't been set any/many boundaries. I went a bit on the ""harsh"" side and gave my son boundaries from the day he was born, and now he's extremely well behaved, and I rarely have to tell him off. 

Fortunately, it can be changed. However, you can't be the one to do it. Your stepson will not listen to you as much as he will his own father. Your SO needs to be the one to initiate these changes, and you follow through with him on them. "
"Call me crazy, but do most abusers really sit down and think ""I'm gonna abuse my SO today, hmm how should I do it"" or isn't it more like abusive behaviors grow over time. We don't really have a concrete picture of what's going on from OP's description of the situation, but isn't it possible she is constantly telling him to see a therapist or that he's so forgetful every time he makes a little mistake and it's making him feel like he's crazy even though in her mind she thinks she is just trying to help? Conversely, he could be gaslighting her into thinking she has a problem, for all we know, because we have her sounding pretty insecure in this post and we don't know how justified she is or is not. "
"""spray and wipe"" sounds like basic cleaning. But there's still a difference for many people between tidying and cleaning. I am someone who isn't naturally tidy *or* clean, but living with an amazing clean person taught me to expect and enjoy a clean living space. He set pretty high standards (mostly through his own efforts), and expected a few limited things from us, which weren't natural to me but became second nature. So I do believe that people can learn/adopt higher standards, and I also think that the more time someone spends living cleanly the more they appreciate it. But before your boyfriend learns to depend on a clean home, you'll probably need to work out a chore schedule. Maybe you just impose one on your boyfriend and housemate, or maybe you all negotiate one together (if you negotiate, I recommend talking to the housemate about it first, as it seems your boyfriend is the least-clean one now). The trouble is that if they don't take to the schedule, you'll still be the one doing the work. Ultimately, it's *your* high standards (and I applaud them! they're healthy and great!) that you want met, so you may need to just accept that you'll be the one who meets them, at least for a while."

"What does 'fair' have to do with anything?  You are a victim of tough circumstances (apparently) beyond your control.  It won't be the last time this happens in your life, either.  How you and your partner handle adversity and support each other through it is just as important as how you enhance each other's lives when things are calm and peaceful.  Even more so, honestly.  Your question shouldn't be 'is this fair', it should be 'is this a relationship that works for me when things are bad, or only when things are good?'

thank god someone is here to tell a rape victim how to not get raped next time. 
That is a great idea. I actually answered a text from him where my response was that our next date was on me. So I do hope he lets me pay. It won't be a deal breaker if he didn't but it would help me feel more like a equal going into this.

"&gt;This dog is probably about 12 years old.

That is pretty old for a dog.

&gt; FSIL's dog has NEVER been to the vet. He's never gotten his shots.

That's messed up, but if the dog has lived this long without them, there's not a lot of point in giving them to him now. That would be like taking a 75 year old who was vaccinated and giving them all of their vaccinations. The risk to their health would exceed the benefit.

&gt; FFIL feeds him chicken bones because he wants to ""kill him off.""

If they want to get rid of the dog, perhaps you guys should offer to take the dog off their hands. You own a dog, you know how to care for it.

Ordinarily I'd say offer to rehome the dog, but you're going to have a really tough time rehoming such an old animal. Not many people will sign up for 2-3 years of life max with a crapload of vet bills.

"Unpopular opinion here: I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion for this.

His hypocrisy stems directly from his guilt as to what he did at 16. He feels that because he cheated some 40 years ago, he does not deserve the life he has built with her, and therefore, if the tables were reversed and she was the one that cheated, she would not deserve that same life. 

If the roles were truly reversed (he did not cheat - she did), I highly doubt he would have such an extreme reaction and would likely try to find a way to forgive his wife and move forward.

u/shouldiconfessit please speak to a therapist in order to learn how to forgive yourself.

"OK, real talk here.  I am someone who has on many occasions left some fairly substantial bruises on several different women, all of whom utterly, enthusiastically consented to it.

I'm also an attorney who in his free time works with a few other attorney friends in a non-profit we set up that helps abused women (we don't actually gender discriminate but the VAST majority of those we assist are women) navigate the legal challenges of leaving abusive relationships.

I am thus extremely familiar with what healthy, consensual kink looks like, and what abusive relationships look like, and this one just sets off red flags to me for a few reasons:

Firstly, and also least important, it's the placement of the bruises.  Most of us who do this sort of thing for fun try to leave marks on places easily covered up *for exactly this reason*.  Outing your partner isn't cool, nor is outing yourself, and the **last** thing you want is for someone to think you're abusive, or that your partner is being abused.  It's embarrassing and humiliating for your partner, and potentially dangerous for you.  So we tend to stick to areas normally covered up by appropriate household clothing.  That said, physical restraint and breath play are existing kinks, and, especially if you're new to them, doing them without leaving marks can be tricky.  

On the other hand, physically restraining the arms/wrists, and choking are classic abuse signs.

So *where* the marks are is alarming because most of us safe, sane, consensual kink practitioners try very hard to avoid leaving marks and bruises in places easily seen, because it's highly disrespectful to your partner.  If she trusts you enough to bruise her, you shouldn't betray that trust by forcing her into a potentially embarrassing and humiliating confrontation.

Because when people get it in their head you're being abused, any amount of explanation that this isn't abuse, this is just how you like things, is just going to sound like you're Stolkholmed or are making excuses for your abuser (because, unfortunately, that IS really common in abuse victims).

Secondly, and more importantly, is her attitude.  Most people who enjoy getting bruised up are going to be fairly upbeat afterwards.  They just recently had a pretty good roll in the hay, so to speak.  People talk about others having a ""glow"" recently after having sex, that's no different for kink folks, just our sex tends to be rougher.  

I'd understand if her mood soured AFTER you saw her, because she might have been thinking ""damn it, now I have to deal with THIS"", but being quiet, withdrawn, non communicative and jumpy in general are signs of abuse, not signs of someone who recently had consensual kinky sex."
"Maybe stop nagging? You have no right to those pictures. He obviously cares about this,he wants to get them right. And even if it's 'only'  a hobby, so what? It's important to him to get this right. "
"Maybe every once in a while my wife and I will have lazy days. Stay in our pyjamas, relax, watch some Netflix. But we also still dress up for work, dress up for dates. 

But personal hygiene doesn't go out the window. Your wife's behaviour is not normal. "
"Yep. Being attractive - of course! - comes with more benefits than drawbacks, but having people think you're a snobby jerk when you reject them? That's just one of the drawbacks, and it sucks, but there is zero way to change it. People turn into jerks when they are rejected. "
"&gt;Say I go through my whole spiel of ""until we're exclusive, we're not"" disclaimer. 

Well that was not the way the conversation worked between OP and this girl by his account, but let's play this game regardless. 

&gt;However, me having to report if every activity I engage in is or is not a date can become exhausting.

She wasn't asking him to report every date. She said ""are you going on a date?"" She was not asking OP to message her anytime he left the house and go ""I'm leaving my house but it's not a date."" And presumably she has not messaged him every day asking if he's going on a date.

&gt; If the person I'm dating is asking me if I'm going on dates, what they really care about is if we're suddenly exclusive now. 

Or, you know, they want to know if you're actively going on dates to begin the conversation. If you aren't going on dates, they might say 'cool, I don't want you too' if you are they might not bother having that talk and saying 'have fun' instead. Case and point: if for example, I ever decided that there was a need to ask my partner to temporarily close the relationship, I would *never* ask that he do it while he was actively dating someone else barring extraordinary circumstances (and even then he'd be well within his rights to not walk away from someone he cares about because me). So, I might start a conversation like that (although, I would know if he's dating someone else, because I have asked him to tell me since it involves me).

It's just one way to breach a topic, and far from the worst one.

&gt;I would interpret an avoidance of that conversation to be cowardly. 

Oh you're right, OP hemming and hawing rather than just being up front because he's afraid of conflict is definitely not cowardly.

"
"This is the best comment, IMO.

Especially that last part. That part of the OP put me off as well. These women are real people who are presumably dating because they're looking for a connection that might turn into a real relationship; they're not disposables that exist just for you to hammer out your own insecurities. Additionally, abusive situations can leave really deep roots - having the help of a professional to find them and pull them out is advisable.

It's fine if you don't want anything serious, but you REALLY need to make that clear from your very first interaction. Let these women have all the information they need so they can make an informed decision about whether or not they want to invest any time with you. You don't give any indication that you told this to Jen, and while fault certainly lies with her for pretending she was cool with non-exclusivity, she probably still thought that - especially given how quickly you intensified with her - you had the start of long-term interest and eventual exclusivity. Letting her know from day one that such things weren't in the cards would have saved you both a lot of time and stress, as it seems pretty clear her dating goals are not the same as yours.

There are plenty of women who will be 100% cool with keeping things casual or even fwb because that's what they're looking for themselves. But you need to give these women the information and enough respect to allow them to make that choice, and I'd echo once again that you need to look at therapy as a more fair, healthy way to work through the issues from your abusive relationship."

"While op may not be an ideal parent, it doesn't sound like her brother is being removed by cps (or whatever the uk? Equivalent is) but that she would be volunteering to take him because of their biological relationship. So if op did not do this, he would likely still be under the mothers (presumably neglectful) care and not available for foster or adoption by a non relative, unless ops mom's abuse/neglect of him because more severe /noticed. 

So in summary he may be better off with op, someone who cares about him. Sadly there are many children in neglectful and or abusive homes and there really aren't enough good foster and adoptive homes for them all, plus many children are left in neglectful or abusive homes until their situation gets much more severe which just makes it hard to adapt to a better home if they are placed in one."
"Jedi are the biggest sluts around. They are the kings and queens of the good old fashioned ""fuck n' dump"". They're just not allowed to get attached to the other people.

Relationshipwise, I'd pick a Sith over a Jedi. "
"I'm active in the kink community.  And honestly this is one of the few that disgust me and have zero tolerance for.  You can't consent to abuse.  Feeding someone to weight gain is unquestionably abuse.  You are permanently changing their body and health in a harmful and negative way.  There is zero justification for feeding ever.

disclaimer, this is only talking about feeding for weight gain.  The roleplay of feeding yall can go crazy with."
"Further up OP commented that he suggested somewhere that's ~$7 a plate, which, even for most students, isn't a one off expense that will break the bank. To be honest, at this point it seems mostly symbolic to him to be treated on his birthday considering he pays the rest of the time, which is fair enough tbh. "
"Holy fuck. Confusing much. My bad!

However, if that is the case, fuck me is he a moron. Getting involved with someone else's past is stupid, and he has no right. 

"
"My first thought was that he might have a humilation fetish. He might want her to tell him it's small and not enough, but he's insecure about the fetish.  Like he keeps pestering her about it til she loses her cool and flips shit and insults it. Then he gets turned on."
"I'm not sure I understand. Couldn't you just look at a clock every so often, by putting a bunch of them around your home and person, so you aren't constantly late, and/or to track how much time it takes to do things? Like, once you set a stopwatch for a few days to tell you how long it takes you to get ready in the morning and do the same thing for travel time to work, all you have to do is decide on when a good time to wake up is.

Keeping a beat is a much different process than tracking how long it takes you to prepare to go do something and travel to it, and then mapping out the time needed and deciding when to start the process of getting ready and traveling."
"Don't talk to him. He sounds like a complete jerk and deserves everything that happened to him. 

I'm a lesbian, and the jokes about converting are so fucking annoying, not to mention completely disrespectful---particularly if you're in a relationship. 

Gross, gross, gross. "
"The situation here sucks, but he probably doesn't care much about improving it.  He came straight from his parents place to yours, so he's never had to fend for himself.  You've basically replaced his parents.

He probably hated it at his parents because they nagged him to do stuff... and now your nagging him to do stuff.  And he's not doing it.

The cheap rent deal is the biggest shame here.  A normal functioning adult who is ued to paying $600-1000+ in rent would see what a deal they are getting.  But he probably sees it as a big expense every month that really sucks, because he's never paid rent before.


Good luck getting through to this guy. "
"You're gonna out somebody not knowing any real specifics?

That's fairly nasty."
"OP, I want to shake you that you still have it as a plan that you'll fix your marriage and have kids with this man. WTF??? He's a sadistic bully. You can't trust him with pets, much less children. Your acceptance of his brutality appalls me. "
"This whole thing is kind of mess. 

I think you're fine to ask for food. I think you crossed the line when you called begging and crying. I think he shouldn't have to lie to you about his actions. I think he lied because he isn't able to talk to you. You guys have communication problems. "
"Call the institute and tell them you do not want to meet at your house. You are perfectly correct it's weird that she should meet at your house and it's deeply unprofessional of her to not turn up to the appointment and not let you know she was running late.

Personally I'd be complaining about her behaviour to your psychiatrist. She's working in mental health services and seems to have little or no understanding of how to deal with people who have issues around anxiety, stress, paranoia. I can't stand people who are thoughtless and seem to be worse at their job than I'd be, untrained, if I did the same tasks. I also don't deal well with lateness and people in my space that I don't want there. It gives me panic attacks. "
"But...aren't parents there? If this is a family only party? I honestly do not understand these parties. What happens when you marry? Is he still not invited because he's not a blood relative? Why do you *have* to attend every party? 

Don't get me wrong, I completely understand the no SO rule. But y'all making this seem like a damn cult. I'd be worried if I were your boyfriend too. The whole ""what happens there stays there"" bit also makes it so weird. Has your boyfriend met your family? Maybe that would help him ease up - and help him realize you're not going to some family only orgiefests every month. "
"As long as you make time for your SO outside of these parties, he's (at best) jealous or (at worst) controlling. I would talk to him and make sure he understands that it's okay for you to have fun without him once every few weeks and that he doesn't need to do absolutely everything that you do. "
"Facebook recommends people to me all the time, because they're friends of my friends (by which I mean ""facebook friends of my Facebook friends"", so pretty distantly connected to me irl). 

Also, since Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp, people who I've only encountered -- usually briefly -- on those platforms keep appearing in the ""people you may know"" bit of Facebook, too.

You come across as very immature for your age and deeply insecure. You need to work on that."
"Not a ""generation"" thing at all."
"You do realize that what he's doing is guilt tripping you to get what he wants? To put it bluntly, he doesn't give a fuck that he's making you late, what's more important is that you're with him. He doesn't care about everything you wrote out up there - he doesn't care about your relationship with your parents, with your friends, your grades. 

Think about that. "
I think its weird that your bf's reaction to you having fun is to be mad at you. That's definitely a red flag
"People vent about their SO to their family all the time. It's healthy to be able to. This sub frequently supports people venting to a best friend about relationship issues, I don't see how doing that with family is somehow much worse or concerning."
"Damn, that's conniving, I would never even think of that."
"It becomes more difficult when you don't have family, and your SO does. I often have a similar problem. "
"This reminds of me of the time my mom got called ""ma'am"" and was asked for her senior's card in the same day when she was in her 40s.  She was sooo mad. 

It may be worth it to point out that this could offend some of the more... ""age sensitive"" women as well? "

Yeah but facts being facts it's a lot easier to find adoptive parents for a baby than an older child. So many people go overseas in order to adopt a baby because they can't adopt one in their own country.
"You expressed it perfectly here, and you don't sound at all like you're overstepping. I'd go to your bf and say ""So you asked me ideas for a birthday gift. Do you still want some suggestions ?"". If he says yes, say what you said here, insisting on the sentimental value of things. Give him alternative (like, a bracelet or a ring), in case he's not comfortable with the ring thing.

Good luck."
"The school has a very nonchalant view towards it. They dont LIKE it persay, but its also nyc, there's drugs everywhere and unless they want to see all their students get arrested, theyre not gonna call the police.

Lmao your present was a visit to your parents. That's incredibly selfish unless your parents live in a villa in some incredibly vacation destination. Even then there aren't that many guys who would want a trip to their SO's parents house as a Christmas present. 
"I don't know what else you possibly could have seen coming. Please go to counseling. If necessary, with a divorce attorney's number on file."
"Bullshit. Father of 3 kids, the wife and I still make time for us and go on dates and such. "
"Given his description of it. No he did not. he might have felt negative or confused but that isn't a bad trip. I have seen people screaming, their entire reality falling apart and feeling nothing but mental anguish. In fact I saw this happen this weekend past. 

From what he's said, he obviously wasn't happy but I can tell you that that does not mean he had a bad trip. It is possible to feel negative while tripping and not have a bad trip, it can be something like not liking the music, or the room. Negative thoughts can and often do lead on to worse things if it spirals out of control but merely having the negativity doesn't make it guaranteed.

I will also say that I was not there and I am only making assumptions based on what was said, but the information, and the manner in which it relayed to us does not match what I understand to be a 'bad trip'. it may well have been but I don't have reason to believe it was one and was merely a trip in which had some good and bad.

"He's a cheating, lying, abusive drunk.

Walking away from him will be the best decision you'll make in your life.

Stop talking to him now. Cut all contact. Don't let him turn this onto you. You did the right thing and his current gaslighting just proves what an asshole he is."
"This dude sounds straight *nasty*. Seriously leaving his cumtissues and vomit on the floor for *you* to deal with? Any real adult man on earth ought to be horrified treating their life partner like that. 

No, this isn't you being a drag. It's not a cunty thing, wanting your partner to act like an adult human being most of the time. Leave this loser in the stink mess he generates and move on. "
"this right here is the fucker thats got you

""find my self developing these ""crushes"" on men but never make a move for fear of rejection because **I know** that my feelings will never be reciprocated.""

as for the dating game, ive no idea, but late game (it really isnt but hey) be honest about who you are and the sort of person you want

no point pretending you LOOOVE partying all weekend and being hung over mon-weds... when you'd rather go for a wander together and chill with a movie... as you're setting the relationship up to fail when you cant keep the act up anymore

if you can meet people via your hobbies and interests thats the gold mine :)

"She's the kind of person who ""can't focus without something on in the background"", and she doesn't like headphones/doesn't want to be in her room, so she'll just turn the TV on, and leave it on while she's studying, either with a show, or because she's playing music through the TV. On top of that, she insists on leaving the TV ""on"" 24/7, in the clock mode? So it's not ""on""-on, but there's a time on the screen, kind of like a screensaver? 

However, you're right, correlation =/= causation, and I need to keep that in mind.

"Don't even reply. He was scarily intense. It was one date. I've had less backlash from breaking off a months-long sexual relationship. Bloody hell!

This guy is so un-chill and demanding. These aren't questions you ask someone on a first date?!!! He was treating you like an incubator for his oh so perfect wonder-sperm. Or a future wife. 

He's also doing that 'The Game 101' thing where he is negging you. What a prick. You've dodged a bullet here, OP.

I suppose you could reply, if you were feeling mean: 'I have no problem with your faith. I know many nice religious people. I'm not going to date you because you are a clingy, rude, intense bellend with a terrible attitude towards dating. Have fun being perpetually stuck in the 1950s. By the way, the thought of having children with you makes me want to get my tubes tied. Ta-ta!'

But then I live to be abrasive :)"
"It's not abusive if you live alone and punch holes in your own house--though I think it would benefit your emotional health if you sought a more productive way to feel and manage your emotions--but to anyone around you it can be quite frightening (it my roommate started punching walls I'd worry they were unstable, and my next concern would be what else they would destroy and what they would do if *I* was the source of their anger). And when it's in the setting of a couple's argument, it especially feels like a threat. Particularly with a history of choking..."
"I agree with you, it's creepy and wrong. Its an abuse of power and authority. It's disheartening to find out your friend has different morals than you do. Honestly, even if it's legal, it's wrong. It might not even be legal with his school or state. I used to teach at a college, and so many of the men there were there to date their students. I'm not kidding. At least the women were slightly older, but not by much. 

I know I'll get downvoted, but you should anonymously tip off the school. It's inappropriate. The parents of these girls probably think their kids are being mentored and it will help them to have relationships with this teacher..and this is very concerning. I wonder if he was testing your reaction with this anecdote. "
"Call one of the friends who drove seven hours to take you home for Xmas. Tell them you need help. Show them what you've posted here if you don't have it in you to go over it again. Call your family (it sounds like you have a good relationship with them) and tell them you need help/ to come home for a while.

Get away from this hellbeast you are calling a GF. Fly fast, fly soon, fly hard. Your relationship issues with her aren't getting in the way of your healing, your relationship with her is actively harming you. You, just by right of existing, deserve so much better."

"Stop advocating for this nasty freak. Why in the world are you trying to make things OK for someone who hates gay people, Asians, and women?"
"Here's the deal. You need to have a serious talk to your parents and tell them this is untenable. When you're in college you're going to need to stay out later for afternoon classes, study sessions, and drinking coffee at eleven pm while you listen to bad poetry. Are you going to be living at home or on campus when you're in college? More importantly, you're an adult who is responsible for your own actions and your parents shouldn't be treating you differently than your brothers just because you're a girl.

Tell them these things and if they fight you on it move out. (Get ready to move out first, find your ID docs!!)"
The father knows this as well which is why he's making a gigantic pain in the ass out of himself.  He's arrogant enough to believe that his daughter can't leave and that he will force her to choose between them.

Here's the text from the /r/legaladvice thread. 

Here's the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5j2max/my_husband_drained_our_accounts_and_wants_to_kick/
First, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again. I will respond to each of you individually.
So, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family.
The update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.
My inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would ""fix this"".
I opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.
I opened a new credit card in my name.
My mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.
I met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had most of the money back, and my husband was asking to ""talk"".
On the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.
I pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to ""erase"" us.
Keep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.
We have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.
My goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.
I also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town. The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free.
So, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was. It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone.
Everything is looking up- I've"

"So I haven't seen anyone say it, and I feel bad people are not taking your side but its THERE apartment, not yours. She's your friend, you had a rough go , she doesn't want to tell you to fuck off.

She's pregnant, they got a dog, and they probably weren't expecting a roommate. 

The truth is, your entitled to nothing in that apartment. The living room is there living room. You have to adapt to there behavior as there guest. 

Obviously your not happy there and its only a little longer but the way to get through it is to try to be the perfect guest till you have the other $400 saved to move out.

"If more people had made it their business to get my sister help earlier, she might still be alive."
"I know it probably feels disgusting, but you sort of have to accept that this is the family you have. This doesn't mean that you have to like it or even support it, it just means that you accept that this is how things are. I know it's depressing and I'm not saying that you have to like it or support them, but there's really nothing you can do. 

You didn't cause this situation. Believe me, they'd be like this even if they had never had you. Just tolerate it, move out, and don't help them out when they need money and all that. Keep them at arm's length. "
"&gt; Are you willing to lose both $10,000 and a friend?

This so much.

In the past 25 years, I have lent several friends money, amounts ranging from $15 up to $5000.  You know what? Only 1 of about 12 people ever paid me back. And those (non-paying) ""friends"" eventually distanced themselves out of my life. I imagine it's awkward to owe someone money and it becomes easier to end the friendship than to pay the person back. 

I seriously thought all of those ""friends"" were good people at the time. :/

I think this commenter is fighting the Tumblr strawman (their predetermined ideas of how trans people and their friends behave) rather than addressing OP's situation specifically."
"&gt;  but because he doesn't sound very pleasant when he isn't getting exactly what he wants.

This exactly. I think he needs to learn the value of not only hard work in general, but humility. 

I don't have a problem with marrying him, but I'm not going to do it at the drop of his hat. If he's ready, then he needs to be okay with waiting until I'm ready."

"You're no doubt right. She's clueless enough to do just that. 

Not to be all ""in my day"" about it...Lol... But when I was 22 I worked 40-50 hours a week. I was young, had the energy, I wasn't a mom yet and I put all my energy into it. I was married and we had our own place. But working hard get so great. "
"OP, you don't want to marry this man. It's obvious that you don't.

You are holding out hope that you can delay the marriage until he's at least grown up and not completly disrespecting you because then it won't be so bad. You're talking about the bare minimum you'd need to endure a marriage with him.

You are not happy with him. You don't want to be with him. Let this, his latest attempt to disgard your clearly stated decision for his own preference, be the thing that makes you realise that you have to end it. OP, you need to break up with him!"
"Your bf has already told you that he intends to harm your family if you breakup with him. That he has threatened your family and has so much access to them is a reason to warn your family, not to delay breaking up with him.

Is there some reason you think your family won't believe you or support you?"
"I mean it sounds like he's being insecure and definitely the professional hockey player thing probably has to do with that. Sometimes people don't realize they have unresolved issues internally that they haven't quite dealt with. I don't agree with many Reddit comments here giving you these really selfish ultimatums (selfish from Redditors since they lack any empathy at all towards your relationship). You guys have been together for years and this is the first time he's acted this way, so clearly this is an exception and not what's typical of him. In that regard I think giving him till the end of the week till you decide he's single like some suggested would be just as childish and short sighted. 

If you love each other then one or two weeks of your relationship being a little shoddy despite the issue being relatively small shouldn't be enough of a trigger to just end it, that would be pretty shallow and as such the advice is super shallow. Giving him an ultimatum like that would just worsen the problem and turn him into your enemy and make the situation more antagonistic for no reason. He's not abusing you, he's just being immature, and clearly you want to resolve the situation not escalate it. These people have no clue what they're talking about. 

His ego clearly is hurt and that is completely on him. However, even though he mentioned the hockey player cheating story and it seemed like he didn't care it probably is what's guiding his paranoia. You need to talk to him, lovingly, and understandingly because he is obviously not in his right state of mind right now. That isn't to say any of this is your fault but that is to say that he probably is afraid of the worst because it resembles an experience he's had before. He's acing childish and irrational, and he probably knows it. But sometimes people need help to come to terms with that. Part of love is sacrificing in a way to sometimes help the other person come to terms with their own faults and hopefully they return that favor. 

Even though you're both adults you aren't strangers, reddit has a very ""every man for himself fuck everyone else"" mentality and it is actually quite toxic for relationships. If you love him I'd say endure a little more. He probably knows he's being absolutely asinine and it might take him a week or two to get back to normal and reconcile what happened with his past. Him being strange may be just as much about being embarrassed or too insecure at that moment that it clouds his behavior. It isn't necessarily an entire reflection of how he feels. 

Try to talk to him calmly and figure out why he's behaving like this, eventually he should come to his senses and crack. And let him know how this is affecting you. You be the mature one for the time being, sometimes that's how relationships go and it's inevitable the tables will be turned where you'll need him to be the stable rock when you're behaving irrationally or in an unstable manner. Your relationship, apart from this hiccup sounds pretty wonderful and it would be a shame to end it over something so petty. 

Even though he's acting super petty, it doesn't mean this is his permanent state of mind or he won't come around. We can endure friends acting petty for months at times and reconcile, I don't why Reddit makes it seem so hard to do the same for a significant other who clearly loves you and you love him for two whole years at this point. Stay strong OP and don't let these negative people ruin a perfectly healthy relationship because of one mishap. "
"He's literally treating her like a SLAVE, a SEX SLAVE. Get out now, this is beyond abuse!!

Either she really left him because of his height, in which case she's super weird because he's a totally normal height (ain't nothing wrong with guys who are *actually* short either... I'm a short girl, and, well, TMI, but guys closer in height to me can often get into sex positions that just don't work with taller men) or the OP is just really insecure about it and is projecting.

Either way: Dude! Come on! You are a super normal height!"

I'm not sure if this varies per location, but I know that there have been lawsuits that state that you still have to serve pregnant women as long as they aren't overly intoxicated. (Basically to the point where they need to be cut off.)

Considering that they still have to serve women who scientifically and biologically are doing damage because of alcohol intake, I doubt that OP/the bar can legally cut off someone who has a drinking problem. (Again, this may vary per location.)"
"Well food addiction is a real thing, its not always from a symptom. 

I think she ate more because the food was delicious, and theres no denying that. But when you eat more, your tolerance for hunger increases and suddenly it takes more to make you full. I remember when she first found out she gained 10 pounds, and after that she was just kind of gave up for a bit, and before she knew it she was eating a ton of food and gaining weight rapidly. 

Its a tolerance issue. She built up a tolerance for this food that it now takes her a ton more food to get full. "
"She's 27 going on 18, and if you're looking for a serious relationship, you need to move on.

I had a crush on a coworker not too long ago, and I told my husband about it immediately and limited contact with that coworker until the crush subsided. Crushes happen, even in marriages, and I want to see how he handles this before throwing in the towel on a relationship we've built for 5 and a half years. "

"&gt; My poor dad had it worse, because he was her spouse.

Your dad had a choice. You didn't."
"I found myself in a similar situation when I was a bit older than you. I chose to stay with my dad, because my mum would have my sister to keep her company, and my dad was ageing and I didn't want him to feel lonely or abandoned by ALL of us.

It hurt my mum, but she understood, and she eventually made a life for herself elsewhere. Eventually, my mum made plans to move away with another man, and my sister had to come back to my dad's.

It's been fine."

I have to wonder about your ability for forethought - didn't discuss finances before marriage, bought cars beyond your ability to comfortably afford.. 

A good sit down future planning session would be in order here, with all cards on the table - whether or not you share finances, the information should be shared. "
"What you say is just as important as how you say it. Tell her you find it stressful when the dishes pile up in the sink, so you'd appreciate her putting them straight into the dishwasher. Make sure it doesn't feel like an attack. Don't compare her to a barbarian. Don't raise your voice. Make it like a problem that the two of you can solve together."
"It's going to be hard to find a house if his necessities are things that you roll your eyes on. You two need to sit down and make a list of what your ideal house and his ideal house look like. Yours would include being in the 100-120K range. Then talk about what both of you would be willing to sacrifice. And you probably should meet with a financial advisor to go through all the costs of owning a home. Yeah, you can have enough money for a down payment and a mortgage, but is there a cushion of taxes, unexpected repairs? Maybe the house you both love will have an old roof that will need to be replaced in 5 years. Would you have money saved for that in time? What about property insurance and taxes? How long do you plan to live in your home? Would you want to move to a bigger place once you have kids? In that case, does it make sense to buy a fixer upper in a good place in town, fix it up, then sell at a profit 5 years from now? You're both excited at the prospect of having a house NOW, but you need to take a step back and think about your long term goals and how this home fits into them."
"&gt; ""I am concerned about my coworker who cleans during the evening schedule. I am not sure I understand his behavior, and I would like some advice regarding what I should do. He seems to go out of his way to meet me, but he rarely replies when I greet him, and tends to look at me for a long while. I understand he does similar things with other coworkers, so I don't think I did anything to upset him or stand out. How should I proceed?""

"Yeah, I was gonna say her phone bill is weirdly high. I pay $78 a month for 2gb and unlimited talk and text. I use my data sparingly though, since wifi is practically everywhere at this point. 

To give a bit of leniency to OP though, I live in a more country/rural area where public transportation doesn't exist. My options to work are car or bike and luckily both are viable. So if she is in the same situation, I can see why a car would be necessary. 

Also, OP, I've been in a similar situation. I got my license later in life so for a while my mom would drive me to work. My co-workers laughed at me for getting rides from my mom and wouldn't stop nagging about until I just blatantly told them that a license at the time was not able to happen and I was grateful to have parents who cared enough to help me out that way. Once they realized I was done with their terrible comments, they shut up."
"&gt;Is it worthy of an ultimatum?

Yes. He doesn't get to completely check out of being a husband and father for weeks at a time because his World of Warcraft buddies or whatever need his support.

I'd insist that he either quit the game cold turkey, see a therapist if it is indeed an addiction, or separate. Hopefully the shame attached to the prospect of losing his family over a fucking computer game will be enough to motivate him to step up."
"&gt;When I have brought up concerns in the past they have rebuffed them and acted like I am crazy


They are making your point for you by their unwillingness to even consider that as a teen, Jackson's safety and wellbeing depend on more guidance, structure and consistency than he's had so far.


I believe they love him and want the best for him, so if you can figure out the specific reasons why they're pushing back, you can tailor your argument to focus on thos aspects of the issue. 


For example:

Would they feel guilty for giving up some of the responsibility for Jackson? 


Are they afraid of losing the right to be part of decision-making for him?


Do they see the suggestion that change is needed as criticism of their efforts up til now?


In addition to tailoring your discussion to gently persuade each brother, help them imagine the probable consequences of Jackson's current path; it's hard to imagine any 14 year old with so little structure and accountability becoming a healthy, successful, self-sufficient adult, and kids like him who fall through the cracks are easy targets for all sorts of predators..."

"&gt; agreeing to marry someone means you did sign up for everything that comes your way

Agreeing to marry someone also means that you agree to be part of a team and make major decisions and life plans jointly. The way OP is writing and the way that he has presented this is that he has just unilateraly made the decision that he (really they) are taking in his sister and that is it. No compromise, no discussion. That's not how people who respect their partners make decisions that have such a huge impact on their lifestyles and plans.

He doesn't even seem to have had a discussion with his fiance or given her much of a say, just presented this as a *fait accompli*. This is what is happening and that's it. That is indicative of a very concerning attitude, no matter how good his intentions are with regard to his sister."

"She sent those texts for a reason. Her back pedaling and saying things are alright is classic behavior in an abusive relationship. Go check up on her in case he got physically violent with her since that fight last night obviously got so bad she had to text you so she could get away from him. Go check on her and see if she has any physical marks that she might be waiting to heal by avoiding you. 

Also that's step one. Step two is harder because she will need to make the decision to leave him herself. You need to basically let her know you are there to support her if she ever needs it. I suggest you look things up online on how to deal with a loved one being in an abusive relationship. Lots of factors and things to consider. 


It goes with out saying you should keep your phone on the loudest setting possible. "
"Not OP, but it's a bit of both for me. 

If I'm going to an event where the point is to have fun with a more flexible schedule, then it's give and take. My friends know I try my hardest and we tend to do clever timing when necessary (things like if they know I'm coming from farthest away, they will leave later than they would otherwise). We have strategies we've developed to reduce the likelihood that they have to wait for me, like if I'm meeting someone I will always text them when I've left my house (which is the biggest hurdle for me). I try to not make everyone adjust to me, respecting everyone else's time is very important to me, but I'm incredibly lucky to have understanding friends. 

If it's something where punctuality is essential, alarms for days. I have an alarm approved by the National Association of the Deaf which will literally shake my bed to wake me up. And then I will have programmed my phone with multiple alarms to keep me on track as I get ready (plus I listen to music so I get a better sense of how much time has gone by).

"I'm a little unclear about who you're worried about.. Did you lie about your dad's death to anyone besides the 10 online friends? Is it the pressure of keeping up the lie in conversation that's driving you nuts?

If I understood correctly, I think telling them the truth, but with your reasons, should be fine. Maybe emphasize that your time online with them was your one escape from all the shit you had to deal with. Saying your dad died was a desperate attempt to keep that sadness and stress from permeating your sanctuary. Saying he was dead meant you didn't have to talk about the cancer, the chemo, or accept the sympathy and concern. (That stuff is stressful too!) That you've felt terrible about the lie and want to come clean now, and you hope they understand."

"I think it is true that cleaning the house involves SOME organization of clutter, but it sounds like she has a partner who is particularly obtuse or stubborn about leaving every little thing out when he could easily take some responsibility for his own stuff / stuff he uses so that she can then wipe, dust, scrub, launder, etc. I'm sure her productivity is significantly hindered by the constant ball-up-a-hill challenge of putting things away and having him take something else out and leave it around.

"My father spent the last 3 months of his life in hospice from cancer coupled with a stroke. He was aware of himself and his surroundings for the most part but completely bedridden and unable to speak/write. Those three months were hard on all of us, and seeing him go from the immensely strong, intelligent man who raised me to ... what he became ... It was painful. OP, you are not alone, and there are people who can help you.

&gt; I want to apologize for all the times that I badgered him about not doing enough around the house, isolating himself too much, being too irritable. I feel horrible about the times that I started arguments with him, telling him that it felt like he was choosing to be ill, that his desire to avoid the doctor was more important than my emotional and mental well-being. At the same time I wish that I’d pushed harder, not given in when he refused to get help . . . I feel like I enabled this outcome by not demanding that he get medical attention sooner. 

This is a natural part of grief. You think of all the opportunities you had ... Try to remember that the Future You knows things the Past You did not, and you did was right at the time. Remember that you are judging yourself much, much more harshly than he would.

Depending on your job, you may be able to take paid or unpaid leave from your work to be there for him while still placing him in a good facility. Personally ... my experience with Hospice care has been mediocre at best. Our (and your) need for hospice assistance was 100% necessary, but be careful where you take him. Mom and I quickly came to the conclusion that we were not comfortable leaving Dad in hospital/hospice alone - in the three locations he was in, Dad never got the full attention we though he needed. There were several scary moments where he needed help and the nurses were slow to respond ... or didn't respond at all. 

This may not apply to your situation as much as it did mine; Dad was paralyzed but kept his mental faculties until the end. Still, it may not seem like your husband knows you're there, but YOU know. The one thing I know I WOULD have regretted was not spending as much time with him in hospice as I could have. I was lucky, my company did not allow full family leave but my boss let me work from home (aka from the hospital.) Mom spent the full 3 months at his side on family leave, and we both know it made a huge difference for Dad when he really needed it.

"Community college is a great idea. I went back to school while having kids aged 1, 4, 7 and 9 at home... while home schooling. Took evening classes so we never had to have a baby sitter. Three things happened:

2. With pell grants, after expenses egad $5000 left over a year. 

3. I got a job the day I graduated, making more than my husband, at a job that has completely flexible hours. My boss just asked me if I'd rather her take us on vacation to Hawaii or Costa Rica this year. Seriously, hell yeah. "

There is a difference between being comfortable with your partner and what her situation sounds like. Does she show affection or attempts at cultivating your relationship in other ways? Or have other parts of your relationship fallen aside too? 
Maybe she would have been ready to date the right person. Just not this douchebag.
"I feel like I've painted her in the wrong way in this post... These are not unilateral rules that she's imposed on me top-down, expecting me to behave or enjoy the couch for the night. Like another reply pointed out, she did not even call these ""rules"" - my friends gave them that label. I don't contend with them because I have no reason to - I'm cool with letting her know what I'm up to the next day. It's the principle itself - that of imposing ""rules"" - that I was worried about, i.e. will this lead to more controlling behaviour in the future? It seems like there are some mixed opinions in the replies.

The real issue that I've realized I have to contend with, however, is whether or not her desire for structure and my more relaxed attitude toward planning/desire for spontaneity are compatible."
"So you are saying these 4 were actually suggestions, and you are merely afraid she will later impose rules?

If so, that is different, and you may not want to put ""rules"" in quotes, as it looked to me like you meant she called them that, and you may not want to say ""imposed"" because that implies unilateral to me."

What I'm gathering from what I read is that you have a very peculiar personality, which some people will click with but others won't.

You took her on a first date that didn't interest her because you thought it was impressive. You had nothing to say on either date because you decided not to talk about the things you know are common interests &amp; instead talked about more ""impressive"" topics that she couldn't contribute to. Then, when she very politely turned you down, you word vomited on her &amp; made her basically console you for letting you down gently. 

Leave the poor woman alone. Learn from the mistakes you made here, &amp; be more authentic in the future. (Were you going to pretend to be that other guy perpetually if she kept dating you?

&gt; I mean isn't that what couples are supposed to do? I constantly see photos on social media of couples doing fun things and I can't help but feel a bit jealous...all a girl wants from her boyfriend is to feel like a princess...I'm trying really hard to keep our relationship going

:/. Please strike ""what couples are supposed to do"" from your phraseology. His failure to plan restaurant dinners does not signal anything about whether your relationship is still ""going."" I'm a little concerned you want these dates so you can show off to friends. Is that possible? And if date activity is really so much more important to you than him, if he's already compromising by going on dates, doesn't it make sense for you to plan them all?

"
"&gt; And I know his dad definitely pushed for it. My bf even said many times that he probably wouldn't pick the same degree if he had to go do it all over again.

"Right? I wouldn't have been so collected. You are in the right, your brother is skeezy and irresponsible. I know this is a minor detail, but he couldn't even be assed to, you know, meet this totally random, potentially dangerous person outside the house. 

Also, your brother should count himself lucky that your family doesn't keep firearms in your house (or if you do, you don't have access to them)."
"Exactly. Not everyone can study hardcore for the SAT/ACT, because they have to work to pay bills in their family, or babysit siblings, or have a long bus/transit commute to school. Extracurriculars are a luxury, not a necessity for university education.

I am saying this as someone who has no student loan debt - because I grew up in a wealthy town and could do those things. My partner has a student loan from his undergrad, and when the time comes to pay it I will happily split it 50/50 with him."
"Yes. I can also see a double standard for things-- if I want to spend $X and Y vacation days on a trip to California, she'll be really upset and say that's not fair to ""us"" because she wanted to go to ____ with the kids and her parents, or something like that. And she will ""need"" new clothes, etc.

"
If there are no kids? The woman is absolutely called out as a gold digger.
"You'll function *better* without him there tearing you down. He just wants you to think you need him, but he wants you to think a lot of things that aren't true and this isn't any different to the others."
"Also bear in mind that YOUR sexual history may be a deal breaker for HER. She might want someone who has also waited, so all of this is a no-go to begin with. "
"Your brother sounds absolutely horrible. He gets to find love yet expects his mother to be perfectly fine seeing him be (presumably) happy in a relationship while she is alone? It's understandable to still mourn the loss of a loved one years later, but to verbally attack and threaten your mother? He is very immature and selfish. 

Your mother is an independent woman and should not be basing her personal decisions on what your brother thinks. If she feels ready to move on, then she should regardless of his thoughts. He sounds more like her parent in this situation and it makes me so angry. No one could replace your father, but someone could fill a hole his passing has left in her life, if not in your family's as well. 

Your brother needs to get over himself if he wants to have a healthy family, but this family dynamic sounds so manipulative I would almost say it's too far gone to happen. Going no contact may help. People seem to jump on the therapy train on this subreddit, but I honestly think he needs some sort of help. He hasn't moved on from your dads passing, and probably won't if he continues to control your family like this. 

Above all, please support your mother. He may be the golden child in her eyes, but it would mean a lot to her to have someone validate her feelings. "
Or the hospital starts a new IT project or adds staff that needs support.
Yeah I dunno it sounds to me like their normal friend turned into a smug womanising dickhead with a stupid flashy car.
"Yes, this, absolutely. You know that the kids have been brought into this, you suspect they already know what's up, and I promise you if they don't quite know it yet they will figure it out. Don't let these kids battle with the question of whether they should betray their mother or their father. "
"Exactly!!! My husband and I adopted our kids through the foster care system. They had been terribly abused and neglected and had ZERO social skills because no one ever taught them how to act. They hit, kicked, punched, swore, and threatened to kill me in my sleep and burn down my house. Today they are sweet, funny kids who have excellent manners because THAT IS THE EXPECTATION. Just because they came from a rough background doesn't mean we expect any less of them. Having bad manners and treating people poorly will not get them anywhere in life. I feel bad for the kids in this situation (as well as OP) because no one is teaching them the social skills that will help them throughout their lives. "

I'm glad you are feeling happy about someone"
"Yes I know, and my comment still stands. This isn't ""disobedience"" or some deep ingrained behavioural problem that needs a specialised behaviourist or trainer to correct. This is just a puppy being a puppy and the humans need to ""parent"" him appropriately."

Chances are, even if you got her back, things wouldn't be what they were before anyway. You're pining for a fantasy. That girl doesn't exist anymore.

Male, female, gay, straight, child, adult, no one is that fucking dense as to wear someone else's wedding dress to a party before that person's wedding. Do not get lost in that smokescreen.

I'm infuriated on your behalf. I don't think you should disinvite Clara purely because it is feeding into Clara's thirst for more attention. Just get through your wedding as civilly as possible and THEN sever ties if you need to. You don't need to make your wedding day all about this bullshit."
"If you don't mind me asking, why must you get married before you graduate? Why the time crunch? "
"Yes. Worst case scenario is you have shitty HR and they won't do anything. But hopefully, they'll AT LEAST talk to him about it. 

""Accidently"" contacting someone ""anonymously"" through a dating app isn't necessarily a problem, but commenting about their work dress and what not...yeah...that's not cool and HR should know."
"I mean... you married someone you don't love and never even expected to date, let alone marry. What did you think would happen? Your only option is divorce."
"Yep, end or pull back. You had warning signs and had your gut telling you not to trust your friend with sensitive information, you made it clear to her that she could put you at risk, you had a falling out that related to her possibly sharing information that she shouldn't have been, and then she ACTUALLY did that. 

She had plenty of warnings, plenty of changes to shape up, and she opted not to. Friends like this prefer being in the 'juicy' position of having information and getting attention even if it means betraying a friend. Your call as to whether it is worth keeping her around as a distant friend you have to always be on guard with, or just cutting. "
"I know this may sound ignorant but is there no way you can go home, get a job to get by and maybe further/better your education? Or go back to your family, take some time to improve yourself and seek jobs in a different country on your  own again?

Things are often easier said than done. However, it seems like you had such a loving environment with your family. And he noticed that, which is why he isolated you by telling you decrease your time spent with them. I'm sure they will welcome you home with love and opened arms. They would not want you to go through what you are experiencing  and I'm sure you would never want this for a loved one either!

Lastly, there is also a chance things may get worse. I sure hope not but it's best not to take the risk.

"I don't think it's unreasonable. She's at work. Her job. It's not on her to babysit his mother, stop qhat she's doing while working, and text him. I mean, the situation sucks but this is not her problem, and, in my opinion, it's pretty unreasonable to ask her to do something like that. His mother is an adult who knows she has a problem and continues to go to a place to indulge. OP is doing their best, with the app suggestion, and it's totally unfair to ask her to do something like that. It's not her responsibility. What would happen if she were incredibly busy and the mom shows up and she doest get to call/text in time? Well, then it's ""her fault"" that his mom is drinking and the responsibility is passed from his mother to her. Plus, it's only a 9 months relationship, it's not like that's her in law or something, she's not much more than an aquaintince at this point. "

Even if they aren't, he seems to have ulterior motives or he wouldn't *resent* her for failing to do what he thinks is best, or for failing to respond to exercise the way he thinks she should. I think the ""you need to take this chance to be your best"" line betrays that really he just wants her to exercise."
"&gt;     I'm also fearing for Andrew's mental health in this case.

If we do decide to cut him out of our lives, i'll feel like an awful person if he ends up hurting himself or killing himself.

Don't fear for his mental health. His health is his responsibility. Tell him once he should go see a therapist because his behavior is obsessive and not normal, and then ignore him and block him on everything. Even better: have your boyfriend tell him this, while you block him on everything. He is using his mental health as a threat to keep in touch with you. His mental health isn't your responsibility, and you absolutely don't need to stay in touch with him because it's hurting you. Why should you have to sacrifice yourself to keep him happy? "

I'm not passing judgment on anyone's preferences -if you find something unattractive then you shouldn't have to explain or justify that to anyone. I was just expressing surprise, since my SO likes my short hair as much as my long hair, and I always just assumed that was the majority viewpoint and that most guys would react the same way."
"Ex-SAHM here.  She's dealing with waayy too much and asking her husband and partner to step up to the burden.  Who is pouting.  It doesn't sound like you seem to think that childcare and cleaning should be your responsibility.  Have you ever even stayed home with the toddler for a weekend alone?

So here's the deal.  Before you go on that trip you send your wonderful wife off for a weekend alone without a child or a laundry basket.  Have her visit friends or heck just sit in a hotel and read (one of my fantasies at that point).  She gets a break.  You get to see what her life is actually like.

"Anxiety/depression and ADHD (the latter of which didn't get diagnosed until I was 24) for me. I make it to work and appointments mostly on time just due to intense anxiety of getting in trouble, but I'm frequently very frazzled or have forgotten to do or bring something when I get there. Anything that is less ""set in stone"" is extremely difficult to get to on time and I can't even really articulate why. I'm always sure I have enough time to get ready and out the door but consistently get sidetracked and off schedule despite my best intentions.

May be worth it for OP to take a look at a symptom list for adult ADHD or depression and see if any of it applies to his girlfriend."

"It doesn't feel at all like he's negging you. You asked him, and he answered truthfully. 
Meet him and see how it goes. If it goes well, and you enjoy being with him, there's no reason to not date. Although some people advise against being with people who make you feel self conscious or bad about yourself, it's not always a negative thing. Being aware of your own faults is the first step toward improving yourself. If being with him motivates you into losing weight and becoming healthier, that's great. 
I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I had been extremely underweight throughout highschool, stayed cooped up indoors, and often skipped meals. I met someone with much better habits who motivated me to change myself. I started exercising and eating a balanced diet. To this day, I still try to jog twice a week, eat well, and even though we've broken up, I'm still thankful that I met her."

"Or to *be* treated that way. I know that the easy answer is man's behavior --&gt; boy's behavior, but the husband is treating the child the same way he's treating OP.

"&gt; His solution is for me to ""shut up"".

Aannnd....

/thread

Constructive communication can be learned. But the prerequisite for effective communication is mutual respect. And if one party's idea of a ""solution"" is for the other party to ""shut up"", that prerequisite is lacking.

The snippet you recount downthread is a constant cycle of blame and explanation/self-justification, and doesn't take the actual issues into account at all. 

In other words, the point of the exercise is to pin shit on you, and you're playing right into this.

Probably the only way you're going to get a handle on this is through couples counseling, which by its nature is an exercise in  communication training. (Though I personally think it's highly likely that the process is going to turn up some fundamental incompatibilities).

At the very least, withdraw from the conversation after the first blame cycle: ""I'm sorry, this isn't leading us to a constructive solution, I don't want to discuss this further right now.""

Yeah, it might piss him off to begin with. But at least it changes the dynamic."
"Because he told you. He told you he did it BECAUSE he knew you didn't like it. That shows pre-meditation. The exact same pre-meditation when he kills you, which I'd bet my bottom dollar he will do if you stay with him."
"He took the word sloth and joked that you were trying to call him slow (because he hadn't gotten back to you). It was a stupid joke, and ill executed. And then he immediately thanked you for the image.

This seems crystal clear to me, I'm not sure why you think he was actually snapping at you. That interpretation is super bizarre to me."
This is a racist generalization. 
"If he is on the same shift it would make sense he is in the parking lot at the same time. If he is assigned to the same floors he would be running into them all the time. He probably has his own rounds he is supposed to make and keep on a schedule. 

They can report him, but he hasn't done anything. He doesn't seem to want to talk so stop trying to talk to him? "
Hit him with 2 options: Divorce or Therapy. Couple and individual. Tell him his anger and issues are not yours and children's issues anymore.
"Yup.

Honestly, if you're married its often best to just combine everything and pay out of one account. Then you only have issues if one person is spending on things the other doesn't approve of, which is a relationship problem and not a finances problem. "
"So let's get this straight.  You don't want a gun because you don't want to lose control and kill yourself.  When he suggest locking it up to assuage that concern, it's not good enough because you want access to everything in your home at all times.

This is unreasonable."

"Ah, if there is one thing I'm grateful for everyday, it's that I am no longer a teenager.

Look, I think it's bullshit that men have to tolerate being physically assaulted by a girl and are unable to defend themselves (and I am a woman, btw). However, I also think that there are many times that a fight can avoid further escalation by someone simply walking away. 

You should have just walked away, kid. Hopefully a lesson learned.

The social shunning may continue for a while, but it's high school. You're 15. People will forgive and forget as soon as something more scandalous happens.

Honestly, I think you should apologize to your ex girlfriend, for cheating and for hitting. Even though she hit first, even though she will most likely not apologize either. There is something to be respected about being the bigger person.

Edit: Spelling"
"She could just be depressed her kids aren't getting along. I had a huge falling out with my sister, she disowned me, and now she wants to act normal again but I refuse to talk to her, and I know my mom cries about it, it's one of the worst things in her otherwise normal life."

"Don't ""imagine what she's like at his business.""

Ask him. Be clear, when you talk to him, that he hasn't done anything wrong (because it sure sounds like he hasn't). 

It just seems like you're really really spun up about this girl who isn't, actually, doing anything other than having a bit of a crush. It seems like you're *unreasonably* spun up about it - so much so that it seems like, maybe something else is going on here? 

The vast majority of the time when I've seen someone this spun up against a third party it's really been sublimated frustration with the partner. It's hard to be mad at your boyfriend - he's your boyfriend - but much easier to be mad at this girl. Is it possible that's what's going on here? 

It seems like it's got to be something, because it just seems like the size of your reactions are way out of line with the size of the infractions."
"I think this comment is unfair on the fiancé. Giving up 4 years between 26-30 is a big sacrifice and I wouldn't blame her for not being able to take it.

You didn't do anything wrong. Leave him. You shouldn't put up with violence. That was way over the top behaviour. You can even report him to the police if you feel you can. He won't change. This is how domestic violence starts.
"I would dump the fiance. You are way way way too young to be getting engaged IMO, and if you got with him at 16 it's likely the only relationship you've ever known. If you are this caught up with a fling, it makes me believe that this isn't the last time you're going to have feelings for someone else. 

I think you need to focus on yourself for a little while and figure out why this happened to you. But it really is not fair to make your fiance try to ""win"" you back and for you to be with him when you still have this heavy of a relationship with the dude you cheated with. You really sound like you didn't think through becoming engaged with your partner at all, and that it's the classic high school sweetheart story that fails in heartbreak. "

"&gt;i'd love to get her out there with me

So, leaving aside the fact that she's not a fan of skiing, I'm remembering when I was a student on a tight budget and every restaurant meal or cab ride was such a luxury. I don't want to put words in OP's mouth here but hearing my partner say ""I want to hang out with you, which means join me for my expensive thing!"" would have felt really crummy. Like, having to decide whether saving money or getting time with my partner was more important. Making time for her that doesn't cost money will probably go a long way. "
This sounds less like an issue with her social media and selfies and more do to with your own insecurities. 
"This sounds all-around awful and abusive and no fun. He is not showing you basic levels of respect. You need to stop trying to fix him, and accept that he is just not a great person, and that he doesn't really love you. I would not even treat a stranger with this level of carelessness. You need to divorce him and move on."
"You actually leave the house or sleep on the couch?! Holy shit no wonder she is pissed. 

News Flash, no one ever died from blue balls. If you love and respect your girlfriend when she says no, you would say okay and roll over in bed and go to sleep. Or put on a t.v. Show or movie. You just deal with it. You don't make your girlfriend feel like a piece of meat by sleeping on the couch or leaving the house. 

Stop acting like a petulant child. This is a dumpable offence in my opinion. No SO will put up with this behaviour long term."

Sounds god awful.  Why stay in this relationship?  It sounds incredibly depressing and unhealthy.  Id rather be alone than be in this.
"Agreed. Plan B is a high dose of hormones that can mess her system up for a little. All is probably well. Also, unless she is actually pregnant there is no real way for a doctor to know shes sexual active unless she tells."
"&gt; Opening up the relationship may be off the table forever, since he's demonstrated he's not very good at maintaining boundaries or communicating with you before he decides to do things.

Ohhhh yeah. I agree. Rule number one for it to work (for me) is that it's consensual and communicated and that there is immeasurable trust present. Right now it's fairly easy for me to think that the immeasurable trust will never be present again. Will this be my life now? Constantly worrying if this girl or that girl will be the next person he finds himself compatible with and has feelings for? Yeah. Jesus. I need time.

I watch porn but, nothing crazy and not too often. Porn has been too, normalized I think. It causes a lot of problems for a lot of people. Some guys get ED in real life because real life can't turn them on anymore. Some people get seriously addicted. Plus never mind the lives the industry ruins.

"I agree that she's unhappy, but it seems to have come out of nowhere."
"Ohh man, this makes me so happy I'm not dating 22 year old boys anymore. That was the rudest fucking thing, I'm almost laughing at his audacity.

I bet he's an absolute Adonis isn't he? And just such a wonderfully deep person that he sees himself putting personality before looks. Someone get him a gold star and call his mommy.

"Wait, this kid is going to have the exact same full name as you?  Doesn't that get hella confusing? And what if the whole family follows this tradition? Each of your siblings would have a kid with your name and the cousins would meet at family events and all have the same names!  In my family I have a cousin, an uncle by marriage and a brother in law all with the same name and that's confusing enough but at least we can identify then by their different surnames and it was complete coincidence."
"&gt;I get that she wants a day off, but it's weird that she wastes it acting sick when she's not. Weird and demanding. 

Yes!! This pinged me while I was reading the OP. If I was taking a sick day to hang out with my bf, I'd plan ahead for one of his days off and let him know so we could have something fun lined up. Not lay in bed faking it like I was trying to get out of a test.

Regardless, it's one thing to lie to work for a day off, but to follow through on the act for OP?? Is it just so she can demand his attention? I mean, it sounds like a lot of the days he's home are days he's *working* from home. That's not time he can spend just laying around in bed with her. Fluids, toast, soup. Those help her get better. Not a cuddle buddy for Netflix marathons.

And who lays in bed all day for the sniffles?? Maybe I'm weary from 2 months of brutal allergies every winter (just starting up now! weeee), but I certainly can't take off every January and February because my nose is non-functional and erupting impressive volumes of snot. (I work from home now, so no I'm not subjecting people to my disgusting nasal emissions anymore. But I used to...)"
How can a person relax even if they're on a full on beach mode when their SO is in so much stress? Either this guy has an off button or he's a robot. If I see someone I love in stress I can't just turn that button off and I wouldn't want to either. 
"You need to step back and dail down your anger. A lot of what you have described is very typical teenage behavior. Teenagers are very self involved, push boundaries. Snd are generally pretty obnoxious. Frankly, you seem to still have a lot of that yourself -- your post is very self rightous and overly dramatic.You are her brother, not her parent or guardian.You don't get to decide how your parents raise her. Try to focus on your relationship with her and make it positive and supportive. Try not to be overly critical. Most of this will resolve itself as she matures. "

Oh, you don't want to tell me because it's none of my business and you don't know what I'm going to do with the information?  Nah, that can't be the *real* reason.

Well apparently 10 days ago you were trying to get tested for herpes. Are you sure there isn't something else you did to piss her off?
Did you tell her that it was a really shitty thing to do? It shouldn't be that hard for her to figure out...
"Melanoma is pretty uncommon in people that young and it's rarely pink. Could be a skin cancer like basal cell (but also not likely since that develops over time) or a keloid or a cyst, or a million other things, tho. Lots of dermatological stuff that requires skin removal and stitches.

She'd probably remember her boyfriend mentioning having a malignant form of cancer."

"The entire situation is ridiculous but ""she is not a friend if she is basically abandoning you to hang out with strangers for the night."", the girl was throwing up, crying, pissing herself and saying she doesn't remember anything. She may have been drugged and didn't choose to hang out with strangers for the night."
"Also, make sure that she's disabled location sharing on the Find My Friends app! That doesn't require your Apple ID but still shares your geolocation. "
"For starters, are you prepared to walk away from this relationship over this? Hopefully it will never go that far, but it's a real possibility that he'll never get his shit together and get things cleaned up. You should also consider if you are willing to stay in a relationship with him while returning to your separate places for a while. Not because you have to move out asap if he doesn't change, but because you need to figure out how much more of this you are willing to put up with before it becomes too much and it ruins the relationship forever, as well as ruining your own mental health in the process. Don't stick with this relationship for years and years while living in total misery because he refuses to change something that's pretty easily changed.

You need to have a very serious talk with him where you tell him very clearly that you *cannot* live like this and that things have to change. (Be specific though, say ""I cannot live like this, you need to get your things out of the boxes and get rid of half of it."") Tell him how it makes you feel when he doesn't fix the mess, how it's affecting you, and that this is a serious issue that you are taking seriously.

Ask him if he wants you to do it for him. If he doesn't, ask him how he plans to deal with his mess. Don't accept ""I'll do it this weekend,"" it has to be an actual plan. If he fails to stick to this plan, ask him why he isn't keeping to the plan. You could also ask him if he wants to store the boxes somewhere if he's adamant that he needs to keep everything. In which case he needs to tell you where he is to store it and how he plans to get it there.

"no, not at all. but my scholarship is an omani one and my country is known for nepotism and bending laws as a favor and he's pretty influential. he's never done that before out of moral reason, not even to get my mom a better job that she was well qualified for, but he might just do it now. "

"My engagement ring has an opal, also a fragile stone. I regret that so, so, so much. The stone has chipped and I can no longer wear the ring. The metal was also too soft and the ring has a distorted shape. I could get a new stone and get it reshaped but it's probably more cost and trouble than it's worth. And at some level, if I feel that if I replace the stone, it's not actually the same ring anymore. 

Talk to her about it. Then perhaps go talk to a jeweler or two. It's difficult to wear a ring with a fragile stone every day without some damage to the stone. For something she will wear every day, it really is important to get something durable, both a durable stone and durable metal."
"Exactly... My daughter is four. Just now potty trained. I've received comments from strangers when they see me pulling diapers out of my bag in public bathrooms.

"Leave your sister to her nonsense. I know how this goes, she does something wrong, you apologise and then everyone is happy. Until the next time.

Look, it's trite, but it's also true. Stop crossing oceans for your sister when she wouldn't even lend you an umbrella in the rain. Don't set yourself on fire to keep her warm. Etc.

Focus on you, don't let her have any ability to impact your big day, if she comes and is happy, great, if not then it's a shame but fine. You do you and don't let your sister control your happiness.

She'll probably come back because it sounds like she needs you and your emotional support. Think about if that's worth it to you. Put the fact that you are family aside, would you let anyone else use you like this?"

"He mentioned her not wanting to see the bad things he says about her to other women when they're in a fight.

"Either you or I are reading his post wrong.  

He wants to have a child support order in place and pay it, she wants him to essentially gift her money without either an order or otherwise written agreement that these payments are as-child-support until formal child support is established. In which case she will be able to claim back child support, since the current payments were gifts.  

Similarly, he does not want his parents to gift her money, since that enables her to hold out on the custody agreement that would cover both his child support obligation (which he is willing to cover) but also his visitation (which she is not).  

He is angry at his parents for willfully undermining his legal proceedings that would establish him visitation. I think that is understandable.  

I may be wrong, but that's how I read it."

"First off congrats on 15 days sober! Also leave him, the fact that he would lie, over and over again until he finally broke down, then turn around and guilt trip you into staying with him. He isn't at a place in his life yet, where he seems to be ready for healthy relationship. I'm guessing he struggles with insecurity issues, and he needs to figure himself out first before I think the two of you could move forward in your relationship. 

IMO he's not worth it, move on, focus on your own recovery, and new job. Best wishes with this all, I'm sorry this happened."
"It's not about pride, it's about self respect. She's going on a vacation with two single guys who you admittedly aren't friends with. I'm assuming since they're going to Mexico and one of the guys is recently single there will be lots of drinking involved. You'd rather sit idly by and let this happen than see what her reaction is to you trying to go? At least then you'd have some sort of answer.

"This was really good. Thank you for writing all this out. 

I think this was exactly the problem I had with my ex.. He just didn't acknowledge me on anything. I know it's social media and doesn't mean anything etc etc but in this day and age, everyone uses it, their life is on it, and I think I wanted to be 'important' enough for him to include me. It didn't help that he was in a band and was popular on his blog.. (Girls would constantly reblog his pictures with gushing captions saying how they want him etc. I took it reblogging their posts saying 'yep I'm lucky he's my boyfriend' probably petty but it was fucked up) 

You've just put it in perspective for me. I am an introvert and I think all I wanted was to feel like his number one. I hated that part of me, but now I see it's actually pretty normal to worry that you aren't the top priority. It's really confusing. But I am happy you took the time to write everything out like that. "

Have the conversation again. When you two have sex, you need to come first. It's a practical solution to what shouldn't be that difficult to figure out. If he can't adult enough to do this, you shouldn't even move on to varsity-level sex with toys and restraints. Fundamentally, he's not a great lover and not interested in your enjoyment. It may be time to leave."
"&gt;  If she's upset about potentially not getting something that wasn't hers to begin with, her motives are pretty clear.

It sounds to me like she's upset that he doesn't trust her not to try to take what isn't hers, not the potential not to get some of the business.  Because a prenup is only needed in the event that the divorce is bitter and contested. "
"I didn't realize it myself until I was typing out my reply! I am (generally) neutral-to-positive on properly constructed prenups, but that left a really bad taste in my mouth. I, too, would be concerned if my partner was telling me ""we will definitely have a prenup to protect my family"" when I would be part of said family at some point. 

The lawyers down thread added the rest of the context: a prenup wouldn't protect the company, per se, but the specific person. Maybe she doesn't understand that exactly, but I believe she's certainly picking up on some subtext he's been laying down."
"the better question is, can you deal with the fact that she's a shitty person? She's very clearly homophobic."

"Yes, these are the important questions.

If Ned was using the pan and the flatmates were aware of it and didn't say anything, it's on them.

If he was warned but used it anyway, it's on him.

If he used their kitchen uninvited, it's on him."
"I actually went through a version of this, not with an ex-boyfriend, but with a friend. We were very close friends and lived together for several years. The last couple of years we lived together, she was kind of a mess—obese, had insomnia, never exercised, never cooked. She'd miss plans we made pretty regularly because she wasn't feeling well or hadn't slept the night before. I was pretty active physically, and she got to the point where she was uncomfortable walking even a couple of miles, so that made it harder for us to do activities together.

Then she moved out of state for work for a couple of years. While she was there, she lost a bunch of weight, went to the gym, and started socializing a lot more. I'd hear about her cooking amazing food for her new roommate and them doing fun things together and I'd think, *Wow, why didn't I get this version of her?* Deep down I wondered whether there was something about me or our friendship (we were roommates and she didn't get out a lot, so I was the primary person she spent time around) that had been dragging her down, because the change started happening so quickly right after she moved.

Of course, I see now that it didn't have anything to do with me at all. People are more likely to change their lives when something (like a big move) shakes them out of their routine—it's easier to develop new habits when you're starting from a somewhat clean slate.

And I didn't ever make catty comments at her. I'm very happy that she didn't keep going down the path she was on before. But I can easily imagine how, if this had been a boyfriend instead of a friend, I would have taken it a lot harder. I doubt I would be able to be friends with my ex in that situation, and it sure sounds like yours isn't capable of it."
"You'd like to think that isn't the case, but it's pretty clear that when you're arguing your boyfriend just wants you to be quiet and take it. That's a power imbalance right there that he thinks he can get away with because he's older and ""knows better."" He doesn't want to improve things. He wants you to defer to him."
"Not a deep clean. A deeper clean. Literally spray and wipe. 

I could leave it for a month or two and it won't get done. It just won't get done. "
If he was simply existing they wouldn't be uncomfortable 
He dumped her because she lashed out at him. Not because she needed support.
"Oh, please. No one is getting fired for this.  

It does, however, help to have some kind of record in case the behaviour escalates."

"If the kids are coming out of your body, they should get your last name. It's as simple as that. 

If he wants the same last name as the rest of the family, and you don't want to change your last name because of your beliefs about ownership, then he can pick ""unity"" over ego and change his last name. 

You could also pick an entirely new last name and start your own House, so to speak."
My parents didn't teach me how to ride a bike so I had to teach myself. Stop making excuses and go about and make thing things you want to happen happen.
how do you know their situation while you sit in judgment just watching them walk in the door? 
"&gt;The kids could have hyphenated names. You can both keep your own last names.

I think this is great advice. If the kids want to drop a name in high school or so, that's fine - easy to change paperwork before you have so much of it.

In Hispanic/Latin culture, nearly everyone has 2 surnames, and husband and wife don't have the same names as each other *or their own children*. Everyone has the surnames of the maternal/paternal grandfathers, basically.

Maria Marquez (her father/paternal grandfather) Martinez (maternal grandfather)

Gabriel Garcia (dad/dad's dad) Gonzales (mom's dad) 


They have kids and name them:

Juana Garcia Marquez

Julio Garcia Marquez

If lil Juana got married and had a kid with Miguel Serrano Ortiz, their kid would have the surnames Garcia Serrano.

I for one kept my maiden name - I'm too lazy to change all the paperwork that I've accumulated over the last 30 years. My husband was a little disappointed, but didn't care THAT much. I'm cool with our hypothetical kids having his surname anyway, and I have an enormous family (no worries about my surname dying)."
"This. I have been in a (kind of) similar situation. A girl I work with on occasion has stricking similarities with my sister, even in her manerism. While it is not a heart breaking case like yours, since my sister is alive, I'm weirded out anytime I see her. I keep focusing on the details that make them alike and my mind is like 50% occupied with it when we talk. So I just figured I'd tell her point blank the truth, figuring that at least the weirdness would be explained, and she wouldn't think I was a nutt case. I told her, and she told me that the *same thing* had happened to her with her brother ressembling a guy she knew, to the point she would sometimes call the guy by her brother's name. So not so weird and extraordinary in the end ! "
"don't be a jerk, it's not helpful.  she needs help and support, not condescending remarks when she is very obviously holding up the ""in sickness and in health"" part."
Of course he has a right to change his mind at any time. I'm just confused. You make good points.
You can forgive someone for your own benefit without letting them back into your life. Forgiving someone doesn't mean you have to go back to accepting their bad behavior.
"He's not interested in you the way you are interested in him. 

I know you like him a lot but he doesn't feel the same. It's OK this kind of shit happens sometimes, especially when people are inebriated and whatnot. 

Try to avoid social settings with him for awhile and erase him from your phone. 

You deserve someone who wants you just as much as you want them. And you'll have that, just not this with guy."
I think you're giving a drunk horny 20-year old guy too much credit
"Dude, are you me?

I'm sorry for your loss. Your marriage is over. It doesn't matter if you love her. I loved my now-ex too, but that wasn't enough. Your marriage is over. Your Marriage is Over. YOUR MARRIAGE IS OVER. Read my post history (of what was intended to be a throwaway). Take a month and remind yourself that your marriage is over every single day. Tell your wife too, that you'll be moving out on February 1. You don't need to explain yourself, or blame anyone or anything.

It'll be hard. You'll be crying often. In just a couple months you'll be better.

You're not going to change her mind because her mind is already made up.

You're not going to change your own mind because you have every right in the world to not want an open relationship regardless of anything she might say. Once again: you have the right to have a relationship of the nature you desire. This has nothing to do with any mistakes you have made previously.

Your soon-to-be ex-wife is being abusive. She doesn't realize this, but I think you will eventually. **IT'S OVER, DIVORCE HER**.

Edit: consent under duress is not consent, therefor *SHE CHEATED ON YOU.* DIVORCE HER.

Edit 2: Grow a pair and divorce her. That's what I did too and I'm glad I did (and my divorce process isn't even done yet!)"

"I used to be a really overweight guy. I weighed about 260 when I graduated high school. In college, I got into running and generally being more active and my weight dropped to about 190. The thing is, it took years for me not to see myself as the fat kid anymore. I had no confidence and no self esteem in high school because of my weight, and I hated myself. The weight was so much easier to lose than the identity I had formed for myself. 

There's no quick fix for this. No matter how many people tell him how great he looks, his mind will keep defaulting to it's perception of him as fat and unattractive until he starts to feel better about himself. 

In the mean time, I would recommend doing some things to slowly improve his confidence. If you guys are into running, maybe sign up for a 5K together. The first time I did a race, it was a huge boost to my self esteem to know that the kid who used to get last place in every gym activity that involved running was able to keep pace with other runners and finish the race in the middle of the group. 

Also, wardrobe was a big help. Even after I lost weight, I still wore baggy t shirts and loose fitting clothes to try and hide. Switching to ""cool"" clothes was big help. Maybe go get him some new shirts, something like a slim fit button up shirt from express. 

But most of all, be patient. He's fighting against an identity he's spent his life reinforcing. It's going to take some time for him to feel better about himself and see himself as he is. "
"How did you end up here? I mean you seem perhaps VERY laid back but how did she and the child 'end up' living with you? How did you end up borrowing money to finance an account that isn't yours nor your own child's? Take some responsibility for your own situation. It sounds like the first date was full of red flags and even then you didn't put your foot down. 

NOW is the time to start standing up to her. Simply break it off. Tell her you have grown to realize you are unsatisfied with way too many aspects of the relationship and no longer want to be with her. Then quickly go through the process of separating. Please be cautious and kind to the child as she goes through the transition as well. It is not her fault. "

"I'm with your boyfriend here.  Steve isn't just someone who was into you for a little bit but got past it, he's actively had a crush on you for a long time and keeps telling you about it, which is so disrespectful to your relationship.  IMO, if you have a crush on a friend in a relationship, the only time you should tell them is if you're cutting contact with them because of it.  Otherwise, what's the point of telling you other than in hopes that you'll break up with your BF to be with Steve?  I think all of Steve's past GFs having an issue with you is a red flag, too - yeah, some women aren't okay with their BFs having any female friends, but most women are fine with that as long as the friendships are platonic/their BF doesn't have a crush on the friends.  Steve is clearly still pining for you, his GFs are picking up on it, your BF knows about it, and that's just uncomfortable."

"How do you feel about trying to talk to him about this when you're not in an argument? Is it possible to point out that closeness, like many things, should only happen when you both want it?

"The art thing can cut both ways -- you can channel your feelings into it and use that to process things, but that can also encourage you to keep dwelling on it and obsessing about it.

Do you do anything that's less... think-y?  Sports or something physically demanding like running?  If you're not into physical stuff you could volunteer somewhere or even get a part-time job where you would be interacting with people and on the go (maybe being a waiter or bartender?).  Basically, you need something that gives you a chunk of time where your mind is forced to focus on what you're doing in that moment and you can't think about your ex.  

Hang in there.  It will get better, I promise."

"Professional sitters probably charge different prices depending on the area, so your prices may not be universal. Also the poster said they paid $200-$300 for a similar amount of time as OP, who said she was gone from December 23rd to January 1st, which is 8-9 days. That would translate to ~$25 a day for the minimum price or $37 that the poster actually paid."
"The truth is that if you are open and honest with a person and they reject you, they weren't right for you. It's a hard truth and it takes courage to meet this head on.

The person that loves you because of the image you've cultivated isn't the one you're looking for. "
"Okay, then my suggestion is still valid: **table the baby talk** and ask him to **focus on the lack of affection you feel from him**.

"Thank you for recognizing the importance of teaching autistic kids about personal space. My 24-year-old sister has Aspergers and our mother encourages her to touch others a bunch. She sits on her mom's lap, cuddles on her, holds her hand...the works. It's ridiculous to observe, because you know the mom is teaching her the wrong thing (she refuses to accept that her now adult daughter has any sort of mental issue, and tolerates the touching even when it physically hurts her). 

I don't see my sister often, but when I do she repeatedly touches me, no matter how often or how sternly I tell her not to. I am a victim of sexual abuse/assault, and touches from people I've not given my consent to make me *extremely* angry, scared, and upset, in particular when they refuse to stop. While I know it's largely due to our mom's failure to teach physical boundaries, it's (understandably) not possible for me to separate the actions from the person doing them, and thus has resulted in me absolutely hating being around my sister. It doesn't help, either, that to her it's a big joke – she'll poke or grab me repeatedly, long after I've told her to stop, then sneer and smugly grin with each repeated touch. 

If I didn't know she had Aspergers, I honestly think I would've physically hurt her simply to stop the constant assault. At worst, I've given her a hard shove and screamed at her to leave me alone, but it never gets any response other than a sneer or laughter. Just thinking about it makes my blood boil with rage, and I'm typically a calm, rational person. If my sister died or disappeared, I'd feel nothing short of immense relief. I hope you know that the efforts you take to teaching your children to respect physical space can have a hugely positive impact on their potential interactions with others, and protect people they could hurt with unwanted touching. Thank you for teaching them the importance of this."
"I never actually thought of it this way! You're completely right, especially since she doesn't want to rekindle anything anyway. In any case, I hope it made her feel better, but it's definitely not what I wanted to start off 2017, so there's good merit in following your therapist's advice and not actually sending that closure letter, I guess :P"
"&gt;Glad to hear you say you're doing better and that you're beginning to learn how to talk to people about your feelings. I wish you had been able to do that at the time, we might have been able to work something out.

Oh my god, this is EXACTLY what I had wanted to say, I've just been so lost with this whole situation that I didn't actually know how to say it. Thank you so much for this!!

Your insight and advice were super helpful, thank you for your perspective :) !"
"She may have been able to maintain a home at one point. She may even be able to for 30 minutes once a week. But, really, she isn't capable of taking care of herself.

"Judging by this post, you're spending most of your time feeling offended and disgusted by your mom's poor choice of words, when instead you should be looking at the big picture:

1. You're 23 and you have no idea how much your student loans are. That's insane. Go to your financial aid office and figure it out.
2. You're 23 and your mom has been paying for your living expenses. Instead of ""expecting your mom will help you until you get back on your feet,"" thank her for having done so far longer than most parents have.
3. You're 23 and you have a month of work experience under your belt. Graphic design is a notoriously difficult field for steady employment, but that doesn't mean you get to sit on your ass waiting for the perfect job to come around. Try food service, retail, or office management. Jobs, even crappy ones, have a way of opening doors to other opportunities.

Whatever you do, come up with a plan and stop playing the victim.

"Think of this logically, if she went to the hospital then obviously someone had to take her (which i'm guessing was your boyfriend) and listen to any notes by the nurse/doctor in case she's taking pain medication.

I'm not saying you're wrong that he should've been with you, i'm just saying he probably forgot because of the current situation."

"I'm friends with two of my exes.  Both friendships came after several months of no contact, when the feelings were long gone.  I was legitimately happy for them when they got engaged and then married, even attending one of them.  

I don't think your feelings are just going to fade, because being around her is going to remind you of why you have feelings for her in the first place.  

Picture her wedding.  Picture her kissing her new husband.  Picture their first dance.  Are you having a good time?  Are you happy for her?  

If you're not, you're not friends.  "
"He's four. He's not in on the joke.

I have a name that has a common nickname. Think 'Jenny' for 'Jennifer'. When I was young, my mom wanted to call me Jenny, but I, being a young child and slightly confused about the concept of a nickname, would become extremely agitated every time *anyone* called me Jenny, insisting that that was *not* my name, my name was *Jennifer*.

I share this anecdote because I feel like it might help you understand that young children are limited in their cognitive understanding of things you find simple and straightforward. It's possible he neither understands the concept of a nickname nor is familiar with the connection between 'Trident' and 'Neptune'. To him, you're just calling him a name that isn't his. 

If your name was Robert, would you appreciate folks calling you Maxwell because their uncle Robert has a twin named Maxwell? Because, to a four year old, that's about as much sense as you calling him Neptune makes. "
"Unfortunately, yes, get used to it.

A very small minority of men become violent upon rejection.  They don't wear signs, so women often give a wishy washy soft rejection to men just in case you are one of those guys that will throw you into traffic.  

People also think a soft let down is kinder that an outright no.  It isn't, but most people try to avoid hurting other people's feelings and as you said, trying to avoid awkwardness."
"Both of you need to sit down together and read the books Opening Up and The Ethical Sl*t. I can see the questions you're asking make sense to you, but they're not necessarily true for all non-monogamous arrangements.

For example, maybe it's ok to develop feelings for others as long as you always prioritize your partner's feelings and needs. It's nice to have crushes &amp; that doesn't mean you love your gf any less. But if your crush then causes you to cancel date night with gf, or if your crush is rude to your gf, then obviously the crush needs to go.

"
"It's not exactly rude, but it's petty in that it probably won't shame someone. If they're not interested, you'll come off badly by saying it. You'll just look like you're reacting badly to them not being interested, and calling them out on a little thing. 

You might want to start going Dutch. It's not an investment; it's a kind offer. If you don't consider it to be a kind offer with no strings, then don't buy it. "
"You seem to think that you've burned all your bridges with family and friends, but that might not be the case. I had a friend in an abusive relationship who forcefully pushed me away and won't speak to me, but I would be over the moon to hear from her again, and I would love to help her any way I can. 

Reach out to the people you've turned away from. Explain what happened. You might find that you still have a place in their heart. People are a lot more forgiving and eager to help than your abuser wants you to believe. Don't let pride or embarrassment get in the way."
I know. i'm dreading having to bring it up but i think it has to be done. I need to figure out how...I've never had to deal with anything like this before...but he needs to know how much he has hurt me by putting me in this situation. 
"Look, everyone's gotten drunk and texted or called their ex. It's super embarrassing, but you're far from alone in this cringeworthy experience. You just went next level on your first attempt. I'm not going to shame you because you're already feeling it, but you cannot drink that much ever again. That's alcohol poisoning or worse territory, got it? 

It's a good thing here that your parents were called. Your ex was getting violent and your friend couldn't take control of the situation (not her fault). You got home safely, that's what matters. Go no contact with your ex and be grateful he's about to be across a sea. No, you will not be friends, and good riddance.

You redeem yourself by proving that this night is the exception to the rule when it comes to your usual behavior, and keep this experience as a reminder to say NO to the second jager bomb next time. Find a way to cope with emotional distress that isn't drinking (running, calling a friend, blasting music and jumping around your room, etc). "
"&gt; I cannot mosey in on a vacation I wasn't invited to.

When your SO goes on a vacation, you can ask if you can go too.  That's not unreasonable.

Dude, this is a deal breaker.  She's sleeping in a bed with another dude, and you're not okay with it.  That's cheating, whether or not they did anything (and they did)."
"I can tell you this from first hand experience...

Having an open relationship that was open from the beginning, where both partners went into it with their eyes open and each knew what the other wanted/expected... 

Is **very** different from starting an open relationship to accomodate one partner's cheating.

Having an open relationship is super difficult, but its possible for two people to thrive in an open relationship if its done properly.  But, when you're only opening it out of a desire to give the other person a chance to live honestly, and not because it's really what you wanted and hoped for... then it's doomed from the start and you'll never make it.

My advice to you, is to tell  your boyfriend that you'll absolutely definitely consider having an open relationship with your NEXT boyfriend, but that you're breaking  up with him."
"I think you are taking this too harshly. I don't have children but I do have young nieces and nephews that I'm very close to. I love them all to bits and love them equally, but I like them different amounts at different times. 

For example, one nephew can be really energetic and it can be very hard to keep control of him sometimes. Babysitting involves a lot of telling him to stop, or apologise to his sister or whatever. He's exhausting sometimes, and in those times I don't like him very much. But I still love him and think he's a brilliant kid.

On the other side, one niece recently got really into something that I love too and we are connecting a lot better than we did a few years ago. I love her as much as I always did, but I'm finding more enjoyment in her company lately - I like her more. I think liking different people at different times is a pretty normal human experience, and like anyone kids can be easier or harder to deal with at different points. As long as he treats them all the same you have nothing to worry about. "
"I see people saying leave... But have you heard of pregnancy brain? I was a total space cadet in late pregnancy. I would say give it some more time, now is not the time to disengage your two families. Help her through the newborn period.

"&gt;  modern ""consent"" garbage



Hey look, we found the MRA proto rapist."
"It's possible that he showed you a more restrained side of himself earlier in the relationship, and that what you're seeing now is the ""real"" him. That's a very common pattern. In his reply to me he said he could maybe try to tone it down to a 5, which suggests that he's very aware of and in control of his behavior, and knows what to do to be perceived as less of a jerk when he wants to. It sounds to me like the ""why"" of his behavior is that he gets what he wants, and getting what he wants is more important to him than anything else. "
"I'm really not sure anyone here can definitively answer this question for you. There are a lot of contingencies at play here, depending on the licensing of this person, applicable laws, the potential for subtle implications, note taking, I mean, who knows really? 

Just as an example, my father was in military intelligence and it was pretty well known in those circles that you didn't air your issues to the professionals provided. It's not the same thing, I know, but I think I agree with the poster who said finding another therapist might be wiser. Laws are laws, but people are still people."
"&gt; Not saying it was right, but given that lots of the girls I was around growing up were southern baptists, then that was pretty much the only way I could convince them.

You are fucking *horrible*. Before, I thought that maybe it was a little douchey but she would get over that, but that is actually pretty disgusting. Do you not realize how terrible those women would have felt about themselves after they realized you were lying to them the whole time? You think they rationalized it when they realized they ignored their values for a creep who only wanted to get his dick wet and didn't care if it was through fraud? 

I really don't agree with the whole ""no sex before marriage and/or serious relationship"" thing, but that's a choice that *people should get to make for themselves*. "
"&gt;Ok, well first of all, think about his headspace. I'm not saying you're wrong, but he's got this degree, probsbly because someone told him that engineering was a good choice, and he wants to see the fruits of his labour. Is it possible that he needs a bit of time to realise that getting a degree is just the first step, not the only step. It's just something to think about when you're thinking about this issue. 

Absolutely! I can say as an engineer married to an engineer, newly hired engineers are often quite insufferable their first year or so. ""Why aren't I in a bigger office earning 6 figures? Why doesn't everyone listen to me and immediately change the way they do everything? Don't they know I know better than them? I should be the manager."" 

In my experience they either leave or learn how to be effective/innovative with real world constraints. "

She is at least being very clear with what she wants. You either want the same thing or you don't. Doesn't sound like she is willing to compromise at all. Can you live the life she wants? Honestly it sounds like you would longterm be happier with someone else.
"Here's the thing.  I read your past post about how she lost the baby.  That was a shit thing to do, both you and your family.  But no one caused that miscarrage.  Stress is a factor, but it's not the only one.  That was her first child, women often miscarry with their first child.  Hell, my own mother had 2 before I was born, and there was no cheating at all.

The problem here is that she feels tremendous guilt for it happening.  She can't handle the possibility that it's her fault (it's not) so the places the blame on an external source (you). As long as that source is available, she is free to place the blame for all of her life's ills right there at your feet.

So the problem is this.  As long as she stays, she will be unhappy because she thinks you are making her unhappy.  But once she leaves, she's not going to magically be happy, so she'll still blame you or find some other ""cause"".  

Simply put, she needs to take responsibility for her own choices.  If she wants to leave, then leave.  If she stays, she's not allowed to bring up any of this blame shit ever again.  It's not fair for her to stay but not actually forgive you. It is a self perpetrating cycle that will never get better unless she takes steps to actually improve her situation. "
"&gt; I'm wondering if something was.

But that's the point.  There shouldn't have been.  What was it?  Is it gone now?  If not, that's a problem.

&gt; he tends to recognize his faults and even take blame for things that aren't really on him

Well, that's not healthy, either.  Recognizing his faults is a start, but he needs to actually do something about them.  And that includes his apparent tendency to take the path of least resistance even when he knows something's wrong."

"Firstly, you guys need to accept that Heather is going to do what she likes no matter what any of you say. My brother is a king of looking like he is listening to you and still doing the thing you tell him not to do. You have to stop trying to guide Heather down the right path because it won't happen and it will drive you freaking nuts.

You are going to lose a friendship in this. No doubt about it. There is just no way to avoid that inevitability. The thing is, who are you willing to lose? If you maintain friends with Heather and Jacob, you run the risk of being friends with people who treat others shitty with no regret. 

Neutrality doesn't exist now for you. You try to stay neutral and it shows Andrea and Heather that you are in approval of Heather and Jacob's actions, whether you mean to or not. 

Personally, I would just dump Heather and Jacob. They look like drama stirrers and not worth the large amount of pain they are causing. You don't literally have to be friends with your friends forever. It's okay to let go when its time to let go.

Heather also needs to learn a hard lesson. Your choices affects others. And most importantly, choices have consequences. Her consequences can be losing all her friends.  "

"Username Checks out.

There are 2 ways to deal with this women who is ALREADY making inappropriate moves towards a couple worker (let's forget the OP is the wife).

The first way is to do nothing in the light of her current behaviour and wait until shit really hits the fan and say ""but I didn't want to share a car with her, have dinners with her, be alone where no one can vouch for my actions"" and have the firm ask why you didn't voice how uncomfortable he was with er behaviour. You have no defence to that.

The other is to follow the advice in the thread - which has been very good thus far. He is aware of an potential threat to him and he is taking necessary precautions to protect himself FROM HER. Yes in an ideal world he would be believed because he is the innocent party but, because people lie as easily as breathing, he is better off reducing any threat to himself and staying far away from her as possible and not being alone with her.

Fail to prepare and prepare to fail..."
And you're sure that she isn't just lying again about when the sex occurred because...?
"You are so brave and so strong. You are worth more than this relationship, and I am so proud of you for getting out of an abusive situation. You may find that your anxiety lessens greatly after getting rid of that horrible boyfriend - enjoy the peace and the sleep!!

Be safe, be strong, and good luck, sweetheart."
"Keep doing that!! I wish I was taught that growing up, but we were in the AIDs scare of ""use condoms you'll be 100% safe"" yeah... not. Getting tested first is the best thing and if a partner refuses, they aren't worth your time. "
"This. Seriously just pull him aside in a semi private environment and say like, hey I know you're just trying to be funny but I've never been the type to enjoy pranks and while I appreciate the humor and levity you bring to the work place, I would appreciate more if you would not include me in your pranks etc."

"As he said in another comment, this particular aspect of his personal life was revealed to this acquaintance by someone else. Also, what kind of person are you? He clearly has a habit that is stigmatized in his community. If someone you knew told you in confidence that they were gay, would you put them to everyone you meet? If you *heard* that someone was gay would you out them publicly in their place of employment? This is a horrible thing that's being done to someone and you're victim-blaming them."

Why aren't you quibbling those other two foods that were listed?

If you asked a random office worker what food has a strong smell when microwaved, curry is going to be right up there with fish, eggs and casserole. Not because it's uncommon, just because it really does tend to have a strong smell. "

"JFC from the post and your comments it's clear you shouldn't even be dating him, let alone marrying the guy! He is emotionally abusive and unstable. Very very clearly. He is showing the typical signs of a budding abusive husband. I have a friend whose boyfriend was scarily similar to how you describe your boyfriend. The suspicious rush to get married, lack of work ethic, abusive behaviour, threats and consequences for breaking up, the lot. You know how their relationship ended up? Him getting her into severe debt, him making her lose her job, him ruining her reputation through lies, her a million percent cut off from everyone, him beating her half to death. That's your future with this guy."
I'm really sorry but this appears to be what happened: he befriended someone online that allowed him to have a sweet 11 day vacation.  There was no intention to remain in a relationship afterwards.  He had other things going on back home.

"Mistake number 1: insulting date's friend

Mistake number 2: trying to defend yourself by saying all guys feel the same way. 

Mistake number 3: thinking she wasn't going to tell her friends first chance she got. 


You can try apologising again or just move on and hope they forget about it. If she's only on the peripheral of your friendship group it will blow over soon enough. Just own up to the mistake if it gets brought up."
"This situation could go in several directions from here.  Now that she has come clean she may want to be with the other guy... OR... the reality of her marriage ending might end the game she has been playing.  As difficult as it is you might need to give this just a little time to see how it plays out from her end... but yes... you do need to know what her intentions are as soon as they are clear to her.

HOWEVER... Make sure you know it's not just her calling the shots now. You have a say too. How you feel today (ie wanting to 'fix it') may not be how you will feel tomorrow, or next week or next year.

I have seen marriages survive affairs but it's pretty rare.  I know a couple where the wife had an affair with a live-in boarder. She regretted it and admitted it to her husband who forgave her when he realised he had been neglecting the relationship and should not have allowed the guy to live in the house in the first place.   So... marriages can survive affairs but it takes a LOT of work and a LOT of forgiveness.

All i can suggest is that you try to stay calm.  Let the dust settle.  It may take several weeks to get your thoughts and feelings together.  See a counsellor or psychologist if you can and lean heavily on family and friends for support.

"This is one of my pet peeves. It seems most people have no idea how to properly care for their cooking equipment or are just really rough on it all. 

For example:  My chef's knife was only like $50 so it's nothing really special, but everyone comments on how cutting is nearly effortless with it. I rarely sharpen it, *but* I keep it in a canvas knife roll, it's never used on anything but wood or plastic boards, and hone it before each use so the blade's edge doesn't get too bent. Other knives were ~~are~~ just as sharp, but they immediately lose their edge by being thrown in drawers, never honed/sharpened, used improperly. Most people have no idea their knives could be so much better. 

/soapbox 

That being said, I know not everyone cares as much as I do about cooking. I pay a good deal for cooking equipment and keep it separate from my roommates' stuff (or currently, my parents'). I make it pretty clear that I don't want anyone else using them. Everything else is fair game. If they use it and then break something, then I'd fully expect them to replace. If I failed to tell them that my pots, pans, and knives are off limits, then it's kind of on me. ¯\ _ (ツ) _ /¯

If John and Ed are living together, I'm sure Ed has told him before about the pots and pans. As the host, I'd feel like it would be most appropriate to put the onus on John to inform Nancy, Ned, or you to not use the expensive cookware or at least inform you all how to properly use it if there weren't any other options. 

This wasn't an instance of someone negligently breaking a pot by being rough. Most people don't own copper cookware so how are they supposed to know that you can't put it in high heat? That's not really intuitive. If Ed knew people would be cooking and using his stuff, he should have relayed any special instructions to you all through John. 

So anyways, I think this is more on Ed and John to sort out as it's clear there was a breakdown in communication. "
"I'm sorry for you, that sounds like a horrible conversation. There is a lot going on here and I actually think you guys need therapy to sort through it all. Some observations:

- Getting the kids to school on time is a basic part of adulting. If it's a repeated problem then just saying ""I'll try to do better"" isn't going to inspire confidence. Your husband wants to hear what you'll do differently, or what you want him to do differently to try and make it better.

- The aggression he exhibits is totally unacceptable and unproductive. He needs to call timeout and take a walk long before he gets to that point. If he doesn't, and starts saying ""shut up"" or similar then you need to kill the conversation and leave, pausing only to say that you will speak with him again when he's assured you he can speak civilly and with respect. Don't take that from him because if you do it creates a pattern for all arguments where he gets progressively angrier while you try to placate. This creates an abusive dynamic. 

- Similarly, if an argument is going nowhere just let it stop. He clearly said he was done talking about it (although he said it like an asshole) but you kept going anyway. Why not just drop it? 

But seriously, you guys need a therapist. This read like a couple headed for divorce."
"I totally understand. What I meant was something along the lines of ""I've bought an alarm clock so even if the kids take our phones we won't oversleep, not gonna fix every problem but it can't hurt."""
"Op says right in her post that the hospital is big and not one where you'd expect to see the same people day after day. Either way, the fact that he's making not one but two people highly uncomfortable is far more important."

"What if op is one of those sponsees who calls you everyday saying ""I'm gonna drink"" and you honestly just want to say ""just drink op, it's been over a month and u haven't started your steps and u are driving me crazy. ""

Though that's usually when u fire someone."
"I know that plan!! That's exactly what I used to have when I thought I needed unlimited data!! And I was grandfathered in, too, so I was super scared to switch or try anything else out!

My husband took one look at that plan after we got married and was like ""oh, honey, no."" He found us an amazing plan with T-mobile where it's only 30$ a month and it works great because I'm almost always able to connect to WiFi. Almost everywhere has WiFi you can access these days. If you're at home, be connected to WiFi. If you're at work- it shouldn't matter- you're working, not texting and streaming. If you need music/podcasts, download it to the device while on WiFi.

You may think you need that 130$ unlimited, but once you really examine your habits and options, you'll see you don't.

As for making money, with the ability to self-publish books to Kindle, make an Etsy shop, sell stuff on Craigslist and eBay... you've got loads of options to get a side thing going that don't require too much transport. Heck, start up a YouTube channel with that unlimited data awesome phone and monetize. One of my side things is I do toy and collectible unboxing and reviews. The channel actually brings in a few hundred a month from views, and all the items are things I would be buying anyway! And all I use to film is an iPhone. Can you do makeup tutorials? Hair? Fashion? Were you awesome at organizational skills and techniques in school? Almost anything you can do and do well you can turn into a channel and a blog and make some money."
"Furthermore his disability (if he has one) doesn't preclude him from escalating his actions.

My sister went to church with a man who acted very much like this, and she was the only person who smiled at him even though he gave her heeby jeebes, then he started stalking her.

Point being these girls are getting gut feelings for a reason sure he hasn't done anything now but that doesn't mean these girls can or should assume he won't in the future."
"Why would you need a PI if this is about the lying?  You know she is lying, you don't need a PI to prove it. 

The only thing a PI would do is to help you find Tony.  Who is someone your husband is scared to have around - so why try to find him?"
"It absolutely does. Assuming that the OP and her wife didn't get married the day they met, that means a woman in her 30's was dating a teenager."
So dump him.  I can't even believe you're wondering what to do.
"Discuss it with her first of all and in a very ""I"" message way tell her how you feel and ask her why she wanted an open marriage and then moved into her first secondary relationship so fast...

It seems to me that she had someone else in mind to begin with and wanted to find a loophole to get what she wanted without hurting you.
I'm sorry man..."
"You need to go to school and get a great job that pays well. Then later in life when your parents are too old to care for your brother anymore you can help or pay someone to help them, hire a nursing aide or put him in a nursing home."
Soooo your mother thought you led on two pre-teen boys? 
"So, you've made mistakes. It sounds like you're aware, you're owning up, and you're working to be a better person and a better partner. That doesn't mean that she gets to hold it all against you when it suits her needs. You're trying to grow and heal and she is actively trying to prevent you, and trying to put you in your place to keep you under her thumb, and to stay on top. Quite honestly, she sounds very emotionally abusive. I daresay any therapist would tell you the very same thing.

Just because you made mistakes in the past doesn't mean that it gives her free passes to do whatever the hell she wants. That's not okay, it's not healthy, and it's manipulative as fuck. "
"Right and a trainer can help teach them how to raise a puppy, because right now this puppy has 0 guidance for a large portion of the day."
"If this is generally out of character for him, perhaps a children's counselor is not a terrible idea. He's only four, and accidents are very traumatic. I'll bet that it's not just the stitches that are bothering him. 

When something similar happened to me at a super young age, my doctor recommended to my parents that I be seen because my behaviour afterwards became quite erratic, and even mean. At that age, it's so hard for a child to process such a thing. The counselor was very helpful for this. 

I'm sure he's going to be okay, but I wouldn't recommend coming down on him too hard. Especially considering he might be having trouble coping with the event and his feelings about it."
"Enabling her how?  Does that mean they were saying things you personally don't agree with or were agreeing with her that your parenting style might not be the best?  Maybe they thought phrases like ""direct order"" seem a little off?

She needs to be back in therapy ASAP.  You clearly cannot fix her on your own and she needs someone to help her deal with her feelings of resentment."
"First, stop calling him your SO. That's disrespectful. Yes, tell her. Stop contacting him and find your own man."
"Even if it WAS his girlfriend, what he did was unacceptable. 

There is really no defending this. "
That's baloney. There is no obligation to not serve s patron with a problem. You can only cut them off if they are already heavily impaired .
"It's rediculus. I can come and say don't serve Mr X because he's an addict, and he might not even be. It's not your concern. A liquor store sells smokes and drinks to anyone of age, a bar is no different. You should treat adults as adults."
East Asian vs South Asian. 
He's going to innocently cheat on you if you keep being naive
"So divorce is okay but refusing to have sex with them is too passive-aggressive? So just jump right to divorce then? Because OP has already tried everything else that you suggested. 
"
"And he hasnt responded to being asked straight out. Its one thing to want it back, and its another one to be ignored, and treated like a thing. Wanting it back doesnt make it come back. So, how are you going to address it? Have you made multiple attempts to discuss your feelings, and using helpful statements like ""I feel..."" and even sandwiching good, bad, good to be even better received? There are a number of helpful ways to communicate, but if he refuses to do it, you cant make him. No magic here. "
"You make very valid points. I mentioned sexuality to set the scene and j didn't mean to cause any offence by it. This is out of character for me and I'm usually the 'safe' friend that has gotten friends out of compromising situations in the past.

I know it sounds ridiculously naive of me to say. But it's unfair that people have to police what they drink/take incase something might happen. The rapist is never reprimanded."
"She isn't wrong about grooming. Going bare can cause an increase in yeast infections among other things.

Sexuality compatibility is a pretty big deal. If you aren't happy find someone else to pay attention to your penis."
Yea I've a gun shy Springer so I don't bring it shooting. If I had a dog with general anxiety outdoors i wouldn't force it is to anxiety provoking situations. If there's a place it's ok you do that walk over and over and if not get it medication or buy a treadmill for it
"But for real, the life insurance thing is a good idea."
"Pretty sure he has said that they were always going to have more, had in fact gone as far as trying, and now he is the one that changed his mind."
"I don't think it becomes a complex situation if you're the one inventing complexity.

You wrote at least three times what OP wrote to create this complexity to defend.

What, are you the wife or something? Because that's the only possible way you could know anything you created to defend instead of what we have actual details of."
"Op should show her husband one of those ""what's the worst thing you accidentally witnessed"" threads on askreddit.  I swear it seems like half the examples are horrific road accidents where the diver wasn't wearing a seatbelt "
"Honestly, your examples are kind of odd.  You picked one thing you could easily do yourself, and one thing that sounds like it's extremely time consuming, that you decided you wanted to do until you realized it was hard, and now need him to do after coming home from what you described as a physically demanding job.

This isn't to say you aren't justified in wanting him to pick up the slack, but the battles you're picking might not be the best.  They might not indicate to him that you need him to just pick up the slack and try more around the house."
"Call CPS, then go over there and take pictures of everything you can. Don't put wait until you have pictures/documentation as every moment counts, but do document everything the next chance you get."
"You are abusive to him, emotionally. You are harmful to him, emotionally. To be frank I don't care about your mental health issues or *why* you abuse him. At the end of the day you are hurting him. Millions of people have anxiety and manage not to be cruel to their partners. You have bigger problems and I hope your bf leaves so you can both get to a better place."
"Also look into the restraining order. If you're in Canada it is a peace bond. You just apply for it through the court. PM me if you have any questions or want help. I've been through this OP and I know how frustrating it is when it seems like no one can help you. 

Just an FYI too If he is on your property without permission and has been told to stay away previously he is trespassing and the officers can arrest him for that at least. "
This comment was what convinced me to also make sure to show the pictures to my therapist. Thank you. I'll also keep your other advice in mind.
"When I lived with 3 other guys there was always one guy who was really stingy and never wanted to put the heating on, we paid quarterly on energy bills and when we finally got the bill we were gobsmacked that it was £850.

Turns out he had been secretly running a massive space heater in his room 24/7 and the reason he never wanted the heating on was to keep the overall bill down whilst he had the best of both worlds.

needless to say nobody was pleased about it. He was a pretty weird guy who was obsessed with his girlfriend and spent every waking moment with her, he had a really weird cheery fake attitude all the time and if we had known that he was going to be an expensive recluse we would never have invited him to live with us."

"Wow. That is awkward. I'm sorry she said that. 

Since it's such a small office, I don't know if it would be wise to bring it back up to her yet. However if comments like that continue, I would absolutely tell her how hurtful and insensitive that is to say. "
I really don't understand how this is an issue for future trips at all. Why are you not capable of taking your own photos if you are wanting to use them for something? Why do you need to use his?
"The reason why people are recommending therapy is that you're carrying your past into your present and future in a negative way. 

Your ex wife was a terrible person to you but that doesn't mean all women are. You've been changed by that experience, the goal is to make it for the better.  Also you mention deployment. My friends tell me due to a host of reasons people get married too young, too quickly and are ill prepared for the stressors of deployment. I wish you the best of luck. "
Did you even read all the details of the post? What a ridiculous overreaction!
"Six year olds can understand right and wrong, but they have poor impulse control. And this kid has a host of other issues that negatively affect his ability to monitor and adjust his own behavior. Also, he is already in therapy for ODD and ADHD, both of which can be linked to violent behavior in small humans. "
Same here.  Both of my girls were trained shortly after their second birthday.  My son just turned 3 and just isn't interested.  I think the fact that it doesn't run down his legs has an effect.  He just thinks it's funny to pee on stuff. 
"My guess is, they're bullying her into dating and sex to make sure she isn't gay."
"&gt;Should I just text him and ask if he's really interested or just wants to be friends (or nothing at all?)

No. Just ask him out on another date. 

Ah, wait, you already did:

&gt;I did ask him if he wanted to get dinner (my treat) or a movie this weekend but he declined stating he has plans with friends to watch football. His team IS in the playoffs and they play this weekend and I know how important football is to him but he didn't mention an alternate date.

That's your answer for now. Just assume he no longer exists and move on. No need to make a big declaration or confrontation over it. 

If he asks you out again in the future, you can cross that bridge when you come to it. 

Don't ask people to discuss their emotions / intentions by text, especially early on. It's not the right medium for it. 

Text is for making plans and lightly keeping in touch. If someone isn't enthusiastic about making plans, you can safely move on.

"Honesty is much more attractive quality OP.  If you tell him the truth and that you are self conscious about it ... If he actually loves you, he would appreciate and be happy you are opening up to him and showing him your vulnerability -its really the next level committment type of action.  He will either say you are silly and still see your beauty... Or he will show his true feelings about what he values in love.  

Send him a photo of you, full body shot of you next time you go out or if you already have one in your album, and tell him how you feel about your weight and what you are doing about it as your own goals.  Maybe opening up this way will give him a gateway into also sharing something he is self conscious about.  And it will turn into a really great and initiate way to learn more about each other. 

If this relationship is to work, you should be really excited to see him, not nervous and self conscious. "
"That sounds like my ex-fiancé's dad. All I asked for was square cut and white gold. Nothing big or fancy. I got a round cut and yellow. Apparently FIL-to-be felt it was important for him to pick out something else to establish the ""man in charge"" pecking order in the marriage. "
Yeah that's a possibility 
"Wow i could not commend your actions anymore than I do right now. It's great you're not enabling her actions and expressing your disappointment rather than ignoring it. 

Don't enable her. Ever. 

People are young and dumb. I get it. We've all slipped up. But wow. Her actions went way too far and I can't imagine where she picked up her behavior and language from unless there were others similar to Alice, before Alice. 

There's also a running joke about lesbians. And it's how we bring a UHAUL (moving truck) on our second date. And that's partially true. Lol

Your daughter needs to reflect on why she's doing what she does. Maybe she has a hard time finding fulfillment. Maybe she's missing something within herself that she wants to find in others. Maybe she has deep rooted securities she's not even aware of. Her behavior seems to be a projection of a MUCH deeper issue. 

Maybe encourage therapy to talk to someone. There are therapists who specialize in LGBTQ communities. And to be completely honest, the gay community runs a bit promiscuous. (From what ive witnessed) 

A lot of gay people also face the issue of constant need for self validation due to facing homophobic behaviors, negative comments, and generally not being accepted... I experienced the same thing. I felt inferior from my sexuality and lashed out in other ways. 

You both also sound extremely supporting and loving. But you never know what peers or strangers have said or done. 


Feel free to message me anytime if you want more advice or help. I'm close to your daughters age.


Ps. Lol at calling your daughter a smartass. My mom calls me this all the time :) 
"
It's okay if you never love anyone else in the same way. You'll love other people in different ways.
"I don't come down on this strongly one way or the other, but your relationship reminds me a bit of my parents, so some things to consider:

- He is quite a bit older than you (my parents have a similar age gap and got married when my mom was 25). My mother is in her later 50s now and is effectively living with an old man, dealing with the issues of old age before any of her friends. 

- The anti-authoritarian streak. My father is the same way, and these things tend to become more pronounced as people age. His stubbornness and distrust now borders on paranoia, and has indirectly resulted in a variety of preventable health problems due to his refusal to see doctors. I could see something similar happening to your boyfriend-- is he going to be stashing his retirement savings in a mattress because he doesn't trust banks? 

- The emotional maturity/stability issue. Again, this is my father to a T. Do not recommend in a partner, you may be tiptoeing around his whims for the rest of your life.

I'm taking the super-long view with this and could be totally off base, but it's what struck me when reading your post. ETA: just keep in mind that whatever personality traits he has, they will probably only magnify over time. He can be reasoned with easily now, but that may not always be the case as he gets more set in his ways. "
Tribal tattoos ARE dated. They are the modern day equivalent of the tweety bird or tasmanian devil tattoo. 
"This isn't about you. Stop focusing so much on yourself. 

I think discussing it with her more to bring her that pearls fragility is the best option. If you are completely closed to it, you could propose without a ring or with a placeholder and shop for one together after. If you are opposed to that too, I'd suggest getting a pearl one but with the option to return it for a different one after the proposal. 

Some people also don't wear their engagement ring everyday, in which case fragility wouldn't be as much of an issue. 

ETA: talking about the ring doesn't mean the proposal won't be a surprise. She won't know when it will be, where, how you'll do it, what you'll say, what the ring will look like etc. You should be able to talk to your future wife. "
"I think all of the advice is great here- tell her one on one so that she doesn't feel ganged up on. Be sure to not exclude her from anything and still treat her like normal- list practical reasons but also be very honest.

Be sure to give her as much notice and offer to assist her in finding other housing if possible so that she doesn't feel so lost. Not only will she probably be pretty emotionally hurt, feel ganged up on, left out, etc. but it is also going to be highly stressful knowing that she suddenly doesn't have a secure place to live. Even if she is upset (which is justified) don't shun her/exclude her/act mean-- HELP her. You all are the ones who went behind her back to kick her out, regardless of how valid those reasons may be (which since it is unspecified and listed as a compatibility issue, i am assuming she is probably not too bad.) 

Helping her will help you get her out faster as well as not come off as total ""backstabbers"" which is likely how she will feel. (i.e. printing out listings, offering to print out flyers for seeking a roommate, bringing some college flyers back from campus for her, e-mailing Craigslist ads that you think she might be compatible with, negotiating honestly and fairly, giving her 30+ days notice). "
"Like, I know that it's extremely popular and in the general sphere of public familiarity, but isn't *50 Shades* totally misrepresentative of BDSM culture and proper practices? Might do more harm than good if the aim is to educate."
"&gt;But I am very uncomfortable with the idea of visiting a prostitute in an area of the world where it's very likely that the girls are trafficked, underaged or doing it out of desperation. 

Deal breaker for me.  In my mind 24 is certainly old enough to understand that these young girls are not prostituting themselves of their own free will.

It's been ten years, so did you ask him if he's paid for sex after Thailand?  When was the last time?  How does he feel about it now?  Do you trust him? Make sure you are practicing very safe sex until he shows you current test results.

But you still have to have these thoughts popping up in your mind.  Some people call them mind movies.  With full disclosure, earned trust, and time they can go away."
Except he clarifies later that he actually *isn't.*
"The sad thing is, it will likely be a true story."
"Ugh, cronicly late people are my biggest pet peeve. I find people like this are generally lazy, drama filled and narcissistic. Honestly, the only way to possibly curb this behavior is having a conversation on how it makes you feel, set boundaries and enforce consequences for her actions."
"A week or two? For the pill, you have to take it for a whole month before it will prevent any pregnancies."
Your BIL is just a creep. Keep him away from your children and keep your distance. You can't do anything else besides that. 
Agreed. I've done MDMA a number of times and never wanted to hook up with another guy.
"He's taking pity on you because he cares for you, maybe not the same way you care for him but it's clear there's feelings for you because he is letting you live with him. The best thing you can do for him is better yourself, find a job, contribute to rent, and eventually move out. He's doing you a favor, return it by taking his favor to try and better yourself. "
"I'm 19. Post is about my mom's boyfriend, not mine. "
"consider one of the texts from the woman said ""unless you plan on telling your wife"" I have a feeling it isn't an open marriage."
"Yes, but it's quite possible that his current running time overlaps with a time where she's working but he's off. 

I dunno, thursday evenings or something.  Not one free day they both have together in the week. We don't know, that's why I was asking."
"Honestly, you sound really immature as well. Maybe your ""joking"" insults about her looks hurt more than you thought, because your sister clearly has severely low self-esteem about her looks. Probably doesn't help that all your relatives dote on you and call you pretty all the time. Ever consider that maybe you were favored as a child because of your looks and that has really hurt your sister?? I feel like some empathy is needed here for your sister. Yeah she's immature, but there seems to be be favoritism in the family dynamics at play here, which can really mess a kid up. No one likes being the black sheep of the family. "
"I don't know, I think it's pretty cool that he's confident enough that he doesn't feel like he has to be aggressive. People think what they want to think, and the truth often comes out on its own, and he seems to understand that. "
"&gt;Now my husband isn't the type to do anything untoward. When girls flirt with him he doesn't realise it's flirting and he just thinks they're being nice.

Lmao okay but sending you a nude photo isn't ""just being nice."" If dude wants you to trust him he has to do things to keep your trust, and that includes a) telling you right away when other women send him sexual shit and b) deleting/blocking said women on social media.

Like I get it. He likes the attention. But he has to put your feelings above that."
"

"&gt;He's never actually injured them though,

Not physically, but psychological abuse is real, and highly damaging.'

Gee, I wonder why. /s 

&gt;I doubt would be adoptable at a shelter. I'm not sentencing my pets to death by giving them up.

So, because your husband abused them, they are unadoptable, which means they should stay with the abuser. Got it.

I'm sorry for being aggressive my comment, it's because animal abuse, and the people that sit by and watch, enrage me."
"If you are covering rent, bills, and groceries, of course his savings are large enough for personal use--what the hell is left to spend anything on besides himself?"
"From a father's perspective, there's a lot of trouble a 14 year old girl can get into on the internet, and putting a password on something can absolutely look like you're up to something.

When my step sister was 13 we had to cut our internet because she would meet older men online and give out our address and phone number. 

You're not doing that, but your dad needs to be sure that you're not putting yourself at risk.

Give him time to calm down, and don't put another password on your computer."
"You can choose to select what photos you'd like to put on your Tinder profile, it's not just whatever is on FB. However, Tinder will show users that you have common connections.

"I honestly dont care about what my FiL thinks about me by this point. I do have internet so I will take your advice, and thank you for it, and I will put it to good use!"
"You're 20. Find someone you're more compatible with sexually.

Edit: lots of people are telling you not to be ""judgy"" about her sexual history. We all have our preferences and we have the right to be with the people we want - if you don't agree with their previous life decisions then you don't have to be with that person. That doesn't make you ""judgy"" - means you know what you want; don't let others shame you for it."
"You got this piece of advice wrong.

/u/vroomvroom2143 is telling you to mark the wrapper. This way, you can confirm whether it is not being used or being replaced with a new one."
"&gt; Your friends didn't need to tell you about his past

I really disagree. If they'd told her early on, she might have broken up with him before things escalated. At the very least, she would have been more aware of the things he was doing, less likely to give him the benefit of the doubt, and she would probably have noticed the red flags sooner."

Because she is crazy hot. He mentioned that.

"&gt; Your name is not your identity,

I disagree with that. It's not the only aspect of it, but a name is a massive part of a person's identity. 

And when I said I'm not close, I meant that we're not very close as friends. We still see one another quite a lot. And honestly, I can't just bless something and move on from it when I'm so uncomfortable with it, and when I feel so disrespected."
"Yes, please! I want to know what was deleted. I generally don't care, but I feel like this might have been pertinent, and insightful, even if hurtful."
I feel like the obligatory /r/raisedbynarcissists plug would be helpful to you. 
"There is a lot of context lacking in this post so that someone can really make a useful comment about it. Too much is unknow.

I mean, did she do it out of nowhere? Hasn't your mother ever had any other selfish attitude in her life before? Didn't your mother ever speak ill of you before to anyone? Your mother never had a problem with your girlfriend? Hasn't your mother ever quarreled with you? Do you just use weed and nothing else? How much do you use it, and how often? Have you never used other drugs? Have you ever had any harmful, questionable behavior? Has your mother ever complained about your weed use before? So on and so forth.

Analyzing her attitude without context, it really sounds absurd and cruel. But we know so little about you and your relationship with her that it is difficult to understand how this could've happened."

"Change the basic ones, please. You just don't want her fucking with you. Even something that seems inconsequential could be used. Like for example, I have a library card that is computerized, and that is clearly not as vital as my bank login, but could still be used to fuck with me (get a book, never return it, run up my fines at the library until I can't check out any more, etc..). Make sure she can't guess any of them. She's got a lack of morals. Good luck, OP; I'm rooting for you to get a great gf next time."
"I agree that medical neglect is awful. I was in pain for over a year before my mom took me to a doctor (not the ER, even though I was on the ground screaming from pain). Even if parents love their kids, they can cause real damage.

However, I don't think this is the case. We don't know OP's family situation. Do they have bad immune systems? Do they get sick easily? Or is one family member immuno-compromised? If so, then taking them to a hospital could be significantly worse than staying home with a family member who has the flu. That being said, telling your 15 year old child to go to a hospital alone is pretty shit. I was in and out of hospitals pretty much since I was 10, and it was awful. They're scary and confusing for kids. 

I think unless OP needs emergency treatment (like their fever is dangerously high), there isn't much to do. They can't get rid of the virus with a magic pill, sadly. "
"Honestly I think you're a saint for caring about this guy's feelings when he clearly does nothing but shit on everyone all day long. 

It's not that people don't like him because he has *different* views, they don't like him because he has aggressively harmful views and won't fucking shut up about them even after they've had to make a rule specifically to stop him. 

Perhaps you could tell him that he is entitled to have hateful uninformed opinions but he should also be prepared to accept that people are entitled to dislike his company in return. "
From what you have written about your gf it sounds like you don't respect her. Break up with her and let her be with someone who respects her.. She deserves to be with someone who loves her for who she is.
Maybe she is great at slapstick.  Chris Farley was my favorite comedian and his shit was rarely anything approaching intellectual.
"If you and your fiancee do stay together and your sister comes to live with you please make sure that your fiancee does not treat your sister poorly out of anger. Your fiancee may take her anger out on your sister, especially when you aren't around."
"That's one thing that drove me mad about my ex, he'd constantly be sending these photos to me, never knew when it was going to be, and he'd expect me to be instantly turned on and drop everything to spend hours (SERIOUSLY) sexting, and if I refused, would get pissed at me.

"That makes perfect sense to me! If you're otherwise excited, I'd put together a budget to see how it'll work if he can't pay. You're right that the financial issues can be a huge stress on the relationship. If you can move past that (fully, with no negative feelings towards him), it's a fairly low-risk situation - worst case scenario, you break up and have to live together for 30 days while he finds a new place.

Agreed. Lots of girls in their 20s experiment like this. It's ok if you don't like it. You might just be growing apart. A lot of change takes place in your 20s and many relationships don't survive.

Probably because she lost her mother less than a year ago and she feels like she hasn't had a chance to fully grieve that loss before her father replaced her with another woman."
I've heard that is a testament to missing being in a great marriage. I don't understand it/that...but what can I do? I am concerned that he is marrying someone he barely knows and that I will have to trust her to care for my father. She is 15 years younger and my father has health issues. 
"*He hid it from me throughout our entire relationship*

*It made me really upset and angry*

*I was really upset that he would hide something like that from me*

*But it's pretty much all I can think about*

*I get filled with rage whenever I think of her*

And then you top it all off with this doozy - *I don't want to ask him first because he'd say no* - as if what he wants is beside the point.

You come across as deeply self involved and were your BF here I'd be recommending he seriously rethink this relationship.


Edited to add - *but I found something he wrote about it* - If you're snooping through his stuff, stop."
Yea I wasn't going to message her at all. Not sure I'll even respond if she says thank you. 
"""Thank you for reaffirming my decision not to pursue this.  Don't contact me again.""

Then block, forward the messages to Whitney, and tell her not to set you up with any more dates.  Especially when the one thing you agree with her brother on is that she should've known this wasn't going to work."
"I would be pissed with her because of the arrangement you made before hand... and the bananas... and the food in the treat dispenser... that's weird.

At the same time, I have a neighbor babysit my cat and I don't pay him. He comes in everyday to make sure he has food (he feeds my cat wet food more often than I do) but I don't ask him to change the kitty litter box because he's doing me a favor. I have one cat and a large litter box. I buy the extra strength multi cat litter if i know I'm going to be out of town a few days and I change it right before I leave and right after I get back. I've never had a problem with my cat going outside the box. I also know some people who put out an extra box if they're going on vacation for the same reason. "
"This is from one of OP's comments:

&gt; Exactly he has a snapchat that he only follows cam girls/amateur porn couples on

"
The wordplay is delicious. 
"I think it's a bit weird, but I don't agree with your friends.  This is a signal that she's not great at communicating, though.

In each of these cases, there's something she wants, something she prefers, and she has reasons, but instead of treating you like a partner, she's dictating.  She could say (for instance) - after two nights in a row I tend to start to need some alone time, and I just want you to know it's not about you if I don't want to spend three nights in a row.

I think you could tell her that you would prefer if these weren't ""rules,"" but boundaries she's asking for and that you will choose to respect.. or discuss if one is actually a problem.  

She *could* set rules that disrespect your autonomy.  Rules like that you ""have"" to stay over on a certain night or that limit your interactions with friends.  But you didn't mention any rules of that type so I'm not particularly worried about that."
"I personally couldn't have anyone as disgusting as that anywhere near my life and would remove them from it immediately. 

You should also recommend that your mother go see a professional to talk to about it.

Seriously, your siblings sound like absolute stains and you should support your mother as much as possible."
"Well, not being in an area with wonky cell reception, not being in a crowd, and not asking sore losers out seem key elements here."
"So the following things jumped out at me:

&gt;it made her say, that ""people never understands me anyway, so i might just cut all contact with the outside world anyway"".

&gt;she won't listen to me, replying that all people are evil and out to hurt her anyway

&gt;she will only be happy, if she didn't talk to anybody again 

I have a family member that suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder and she has said these things verbatim on a few occasions. In her situation, the BPD made socialization difficult and she blamed all of her problems on other people and genuinely believed everyone was out to get her. Additionally, the BPD created social anxiety that kept her from leaving the house for weeks at a time. I am in no way suggesting that your SO has BPD (it would be ridiculous to speculate on a diagnosis from here), but it does sound like she is in crisis and needs to redouble her efforts with her therapist.

&gt;that I could just take care of whatever contact with people she couln't avoid.

Absolutely not. While you cannot force her to respond to people, it is absolutely unfair and unrealistic for her to force you into that position. If I were in your shoes, I would tell her something like, ""I disagree with your plan and am concerned about you. I can't force you to talk to people, but I am absolutely not going to communicate for you. If you want to do this, you will have to deal with the consequences yourself: I will not be managing your relationships or communication for you.""

It is very alarming. If possible, I would reach out to her therapist and state your concerns. The therapist can't tell you anything about your SO's diagnosis or treatment, because of doctor/patient confidentiality, but they absolutely can *listen* to concerns of her loved ones."
"If you can trust your girlfriend, I think you should tell her the truth. It doesn't really sound like this is just cross dressing--it sounds like you secretly identify as transgender. Your girlfriend deserves to know the gender of her partner and to decide if this is something she can accept, because going forward you may want to explore other aspects of your gender. As difficult and as frightening as it may be, I think you should tell her the full extent of your feelings and see whether this relationship has a future. "
"Well I'm not gonna lie, even so there's some chance that this news is going to hurt the relationship, if for no other reason than ""I may have abandoned my old family, but I'm starting a NEW family and we're so happy!"" isn't a good look to your daughter. But you can't just be miserable on purpose your whole life as a show of contrition. 

I would talk with Mia about it and discuss a timeline of about six months for your proposal and see if you are able to open up lines of communication a bit more so that you don't have to come completely out of left field with the announcement. "
"If he needs to get away then he can *ask* his adult son if he can please visit, and then ask for how long. OP said his dad *told* him he was going to visit for *a few months* which is excessive. And he sure as hell doesn't treat his son this way if he's wanting to spend more father/son time together. "
And she's been looking since *birth.*
"It's already necessary. I don't understand why you don't get that. 

Step 1: Find out if the check has been cashed.

Step 2: If it hasn't, have your grandmother go to the bank and cancel it. If it has, go to the police.

Edit to add: I agree with the people saying she's not responsible to be your mail keeper. If I were her I would be highly annoyed at this point and would write ""return to sender, no longer lives here"" on everything and return to the post office.

"&gt;I'm not interested in having a debate about this

After which you proceed to debate him on it in an immature attempt to have ""the last word"".

Either you want to argue with people about it or you don't. You can't just state your point and ask everybody that disagrees to not respond."
"WTF this is one of the most class-snubbing comments I've seen.

It definitely IS a sacrifice if you are used to, and can afford on your own, a nice vacation but have to tone it down because your partner doesn't want to or can't pull his financial weight in a context of a relationship.

If SO on her own has X lifestyle, and OP on HIS own has Z lifestyle, but together they have Y lifestyle...that's an upgrade for OP and a sacrifice from the SO. Isn't that the definition of the word sacrifice??? 

Maybe OP doesn't care about the ""Y"" lifestyle and is ok with Z. But it sounds like his partner would like someone more ambitious, which is also her right! They just aren't compatible, that's it.

"
"I've heard it as ""oh she's very involved with our kids, I hope she's not going to make them rely on her then dissappear"". 
Which, depending on how long she was with the bf, might be where the parents are coming from. "
"As a guy who naturally makes female friends, and married for 14+ years, this isn't going to go away. He's going to have female friends. 

However, I think it's reasonable to say no 1:1 dates with other girls while you're in a committed relationship. 

If he can't agree to that, move on. "
"Yup, you nailed it. And now you understand what needs to be done. Simple."
"I agree, I think being proactive about a few key strategies is the best way to handle it. Everyone is jumping to extreme measures here. This situation does not need to become a sitcom episode if he stays sober and acts rationally."
"If the company won't pay for a second rental car he should just pay for it on his own -- it sounds like this is feasible for you financially.  Even though he won't know anyone else there, he doesn't have to hang out with her all the time, or any of the time, and certainly only in public.  He should also report what she said to you about breaking up marriages, this was an inappropriate threat in a work setting and definitely HR actionable.  


For him to not drink is an excellent idea.  Actually, it can be quite entertaining to drink iced tea while everyone around you gets shit-faced.  :)"
Chemists aren’t pharmacologists or pharmacists. 
"I think it's definitely gross, borderline predatory even if your friend himself doesn't realise it. As another commenter said, how many of these lunches, dinners and video game sessions are with male students? I'm sure we can guess. It's not a good look to pounce the second they graduate &amp; it points to grooming behaviour beforehand. I wouldn't want to be friends with him anymore either. "
"That's a tough one. Trust is very hard to repair.


Since you just found out about it, it feels fresh even though it was years ago. If he hasn't done anything to arouse your suspicion since then, as it sounds like he hasn't since that traumatic incident, may I suggest more therapy? You may eventually come to the conclusion that you can't get over this. That's okay - better to end things now than in another 7 years."
You're every doctor's nightmare. 
"Holy insecure, batsman.

He's showing you how he'll handle things when he feels threatened. And he's showing you what situations make him feel threatened. 

He's showing you what he thinks of you. He either thinks you have one foot out the door, or are so weak-willed that you can't resist anyone else that shows interest.

And it's pretty messed up that he thinks he can pressure you into quitting your job after only being in your life for 7 months."
"I would encourage your brother to get counseling with his ex to have someone help them work out a consistent parenting style for their children.  It's unhealthy and confusing for them to have two sets of rules like this, especially since they are so young.  It's nice that he wants his kids to be respectful, but he's taking it kind of far.  His kids are going to end up resenting him if he doesn't relax.  

You guys clearly weren't raised like this.  Where does he get it from?"
"My SO and I have been together (exclusively) for almost 2 years now. When both of us started dating, we went together to get STD checks to make sure neither of us were carrying anything (or had anything). My SO, like you, has the same IUD, and she wanted to make sure we were both good so we could have unprotected sex. I think more people should do what you are requesting, to be honest."
"Because he's her father and that's what he signed up for when he had a kid. The attitude of 'you decided you knew better so fuck you' isn't conducive to great parenting. Every teenager since the dawn of humankind has thought that they knew better than their parents, and most parents support them anyway and help them when they're in danger. You'll note that I didn't say that he had to support her while she was with her bf, but he should absolutely help her escape her cheating, emotionally abusive bf while she still has a chance to put her life back together. It's not as though she can't learn to make smarter decisions with some help along the way. "
"If you've been planning this for months, you may be done with emotional processing. I wouldn't worry if you don't feel sad/bad. I broke up with a boyfriend once after months of planning, and it was like being set free. 

Edited to add: congrats on taking charge of your life and doing what you needed to do :) "
"okay so number one, this relationship is only 7 months in. he shouldn't even be TELLING you things like that. even if you've been dating for years, his insecurities will never have the right to dictate your choices. seven months is too early to have his insecurities cause issues like this. this either needs to stop here, or you should leave. if this doesn't stop here, you'll be in for one hell of a ride with his insecurities when this relationship gets older than 7 months.

however, i think there are a couple red flags that are concerning and will become problems in the future if you decide to stay together.

1) he resents that you work with men (even if it's split men and women). his insecurities do not want you anywhere near a situation like this.

2) he gets angry when a guy that you know comes up to say hi. will he be fine with you having male friends? male co workers?

3) he is insecure as hell to the fact that guys will look at you, says that they will use you for spank-bank material. so, does that mean you can't ever leave the house? get a job in a male dominated field? dress up when you aren't with him? get your hair done for work?

4) if you don't agree with him, he starts blaming you and saying that you like the attention from other men. this could also be inferred as him slut shaming you for wearing yoga pants. but the fact that you not bending over to his insecurities changes this into a ""you probably like the attention"" retort is not acceptable at all.

all symptoms of insecurities that will try to control you as the relationship goes on."
"My roommate has her boyfriend over every weekend and I'm used enough to it now that I don't really give a shit if he's in our room when I come in after a shower in my towel. He's always left the room so I can change, but if he didn't I would do it anyway, since it's my room not his lol and I'm not shy about my body. Maybe that's what your girlfriend was thinking? Depends where she keeps her clothes really. "
"I'm really good at embarrassing myself, to the point that I rarely get embarrassed anymore.  (Example: called my boss ""babe"" because that's what I call my husband and, whoops, it just slipped out.  That's me in a nutshell, lol.)

Rather than act awkward and nervous, I'd just act like it never happened.  I mean, it's not like he's going to bring it up.  He was probably just as embarrassed.  So I'd just go to work tomorrow, be like ""Hey, how was your weekend?"" and plug along like it was any other day.  Then he'll know that you're not ashamed (even if you still kind of are), he won't be ashamed, and you'll go back to being friends.

We all do silly, awkward things.  The trick is to not let it consume you.  We are always our worst critics."

"Yeah, stopped in my tracks when I read that. WTH?! :/"
What the duck is wrong with you? It's a simple question with a simple answer. What are you afraid of?
Leftovers are my favourite food.
You wanted your bf to abandon his friend in the ER? 
"I'm sorry to hear you went through that. 

And you are right I have the power to make things better for my kids.  

Thank you so much for your response, it has opened my eyes, it's not about me it about my kids and them alone."
"Please help her by giving her food and bus fare if you can.  She will be initially embarrassed, but believe me, she will appreciate the help.  If it were me, I would help maybe weekly - like give her bus fare for the week and maybe give her a bag of food every week.  That way you know for sure that she doesn't use it all up and she has transportation and food.  You are so kind to care.  So many do not."
"&gt;I want him to see that I want to be with him.

Well, unfortunately he might not want to be with you if being poly is truly who you are.

Just have to bring it up with him and see what happens.  Poly aside, it sounds like you two have different ideas in the bedroom anyways, which would have grown into a bigger problem overtime regardless, so..."
