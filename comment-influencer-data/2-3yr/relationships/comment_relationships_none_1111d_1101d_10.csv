Why do you think community college is a waste of time? The literally millions of people who have gotten degrees and jobs out of it beg to differ...
"Yup. What I'm reading is, ""I'm willing to do anything! But not really."" I would make couples and individual counseling (the latter I'd say is even more important than couples in my opinion) mandatory for you to consider staying. He needs to show he's willing to completely expose and discuss his own issues here. And, I'd consider even separating anyway while that is ongoing. That is, live apart from each other to have time and space while you both work on things. Don't date other people, but just get some breathing room."
"&gt; Time to fix them or at least strengthen the areas around them to prevent a major blow out.

This is extremely valuable advice. 

It's not the same part of the body, but I have a severe knee injury, and I've been in physical therapy all year and the main thing I am doing is working to strengthen the surrounding muscles while the injured part heals. 

My husband had a sore back (not so bad as OP's, but still painful) and he started doing yoga stretches at home, and it did him a world of good.

OP, you might look into a few sessions of PT to teach you exercises to do at home to strengthen your back muscles safely. Your ins may cover this. My ins covers most of my PT; I pay part."
"You already started your post painting your wife in a negative light. You didn't want anyone to say ""hey stay with her, you can make this work."" 



You went so out of your way to make sure no one would see her in a positive way.



But this other woman... She's oh so great. And you have things in common. Even things you don't have in common with your wife. 



You've admitted that you settled for her. You're already *emotionally* cheating on her. Do her a favor and just divorce her. Believe me, that'll hurt a lot less than what you're doing to her now. 



I can't believe you're trying to justify your actions because you married her so you wouldn't be lonely. That's a shitty thing to do in it's own right. How do you not see any fault in your actions? What if your wife was doing this to you?"
"No, you are not an asshole. You do need to take care of yourself. Try and get medication. Or talk to a therapist. I know it seems impossible. You deserve to feel better. Also, block your mom. You don't need the negative effects she gives you. "
"Stop trying to decode the female mind. That's patronizing bullshit. Treat women like human beings and you'll be much more successful.

"Hi op, I would recommend talking to him and express how you feel. Communication is key. Have you thought perhaps he feels unloved as well? I have gone through what you are going through. At some point I didn't love myself and my actions caused my boyfriend to feel that I didn't love him (he stopped showing affection). Please start by loving yourself and talk to your man! Perhaps he feels that you need space. "
"I don't think you sound stupid at all. I think it's fucking creepy as hell. Chelsea needs to stop, you need to use a fake name to see if she copies it, and everyone needs to stop telling you you're silly for being worried. I'd be totally freaked out. This is not normal behavior."
"You're a disgusting human.  What happened is exactly what you wanted to happen.  With total disregard over your scumbag friend's relationship.  Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, you should sit back and wait for it to happen to you at some point.  Because it will."
"Yah, the thing is...if someone gets back to their hotel room at 9:10am, they won't actually leave until 10ish (after packing and travel to the station). What Ben did was an asshole move and he definitely should've tried to compromise because it's a trip away from home (there are risks and logistic issues with this), but the the OP just didn't care enough to follow-through with their agreed time. At the same time, Ben could've sent a message to warn you that you were cutting it close. He obviously didn't give a shit about you. Now that you've committed fraud, it's going to be tough to prove your side of the story."
"&gt;asked him if he had the choice over harley or me, if he would pick me.

THIS IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF TALKING ABOUT CELEB CRUSHES. 

If you want to talk about celebs, KEEP IT FANTASY. Harley Quinn is a character designed by EXPERTS in the field of selling sex. She was crafted, drawn and designed to make guys feel attracted to and enticed by her.  

Also, I hate having people as backgrounds on my phone and 100% prefer space or scenery"
"I am nearly the same age, and nearly the same position, right down to the only bill he pays is the cable bill. Because if I had to pay it, there would be no tv. My game plan is to start individual therapy, let the therapist know what my end goal is, and then start 'couples therapy'. 

My hope is that he realizes he is unhappy as well, and have it be a mutual split. But I suspect convincing him to leave me and live on 1K/month is going to be tough. I honestly doubt your hubby could manage it. You may want to call your area's welfare department and tell them you and hubby will be splitting, he will only have x income, and what programs (like housing vouchers etc) are available to him. Best wishes, and good luck!"
"In healthy couples, your partner is NEVER mean to you. They might be frustrated, they might snap a little and then be like ""sorry, that was unfair"" but they never call you names, put you down, or make you feel like you're useless or stupid. Literally NEVER - not once. If a friend or coworker did that to you what would you think of them? So why accept it from your husband?

He is abusive, and has trained you to think that you deserve it, because you make actual mistakes sometimes. Everybody makes mistakes, forgets things, or hurts someone's feelings by accident - not everybody is berated and insulted for it by someone who loves them."
"Did your in-laws ever apologize for insulting your mother? Have they ever done anything to try to be more inclusive with your parents? You discuss honoring your inlaws traditions often, but not your parents. I wonder if they feel left out or steam rolled. I don't think you're the person that needs to solve their relationship issues. The person who threw the first punch needs to be the person that makes the first apology or reaches out.

Ask for the birthday party itself, I think I would ascribe to the separate-but-equal policy. Your parents aren't saying that they don't want to celebrate your daughter, they're saying your in-laws make them uncomfortable. Family Dynamics are hard and sometimes there's no fix."
"Weight loss advice: If you're cutting calories and not seeing results, invest in a food scale.

Relationship advice: You're the one who brought up weight loss for the pictures in the first place. I don't see much of a correlation there between that discussion, your current weight, and the lack of proposal. I'd just be upfront and go 'Hey, you mentioned proposing in August. What's our timeline looking like here?'"
"I have trust issues.  I've been cheated on before.  But I was finally at a point where I trusted my now ex.  When he told me it was nothing I actually believed him.  A few days later he asked for a ""break""  that's when I realized my gut was right.  Called him out,  he admitted it after some prodding.  I seem to be a cheating douchebag magnet. "
"Don't listen to somebody who dares make wild accusations and off-base assumptions about your finances without any information.  

Honestly, I've never been a super big wedding person, and my heart broke at your post.  The way he reacted to your SIL and enjoyed their wedding and talks about his own big wedding while denying you the same feeling of love and specialness, it's so heartbreaking I wish I could hug you. "
"o_O  *twitching eyelid*

Honestly, it sounded like from your post that being ""financially prudent"" was part of what you meant by ""pragmatic"". I mean, why in the fucking hell was ""let's get a friend to take pictures"" pragmatic when you could have easily afforded a professional photographer? You had a ""mix tape"" instead of a DJ/band? You didn't even get a beautiful wedding gown you wanted? Or invite all of the family/friends that you wanted to have?

*more eyelid twitching*"
"The best thing you can do is look into his options for healthcare. With his age, family status, and what is probably not much of an income, he may be eligible for subsidized health insurance. He may not know how to navigate the process, so helping him do that will go a long way and would be wise.  "
"Well she's from Singapore, so she probably wouldn't care."
"Two things:

1. You cant ""show her"" she is emotionally ready for a relationship, that is something only she can decide for herself.

2.It is unlikely  to find your GF at a frat party, most people there are just looking for some fun and maybe casual sex.

 "
And we all deserve respect regardless of our size.
"How do I even refer him to a psychologist? This has all been out of character for him, but I'm actually afraid of him right now and I never in a million years thought I'd ever be afraid of my husband. I don't know how to help him or even if I want to right now. It's all s confusing. "
"&gt; And I also don't think his shitty behavior postdates her cheating. I think he was a shitty, horrible husband all along.

I'm guessing this true.

Plus, honestly, even if he was a perfect angel prior to the cheating... that is not an excuse for this behavior. Yes, cheating is horrible. Yes, being cheated on hurts. But it doesn't suddenly excuse you from all wrongdoing afterwords. Screaming for hours when you first find out? Yes, sure. Screaming for hours over every little thing for TWO YEARS afterwords? Not acceptable. And not being a good parent is NEVER acceptable. 

Obviously every post is biased, blah blah blah, but if what the 
OP wrote there is true, I think it's clear that at the very least, they are BOTH at fault here."
"Okay. I think I would have to leave while he is at work, because otherwise I won't be able to. I also realize it is physical and emotional abuse, but am unable to communicate it to him (just results in larger argument). Unfortunately I do not live close to family, but maybe a friend can take me in for a few days until I leave for good. "
"That might be a good place to start then.  Talk to her about how he still has a lot of resentment, see how she reacts.  If she seems genuinely remorseful, suggest she apologize.  Not that she try to justify or excuse her actions, but that she go to her son and say plainly ""I wasn't the mother I should have been to you, and I am sorry.  I would love for us to rebuild our relationship and am willing to put in the work to do that.""  Honestly if she balks at all at saying that, your husband is probably right to still be angry.  "
"I would CC the Professor's direct superior or equivalent, also."
"Ehhh, depends on the major. Even though real-life has bills and other bullshit, at least when you're done with work, you're done with work (not for all jobs of course). In college I felt like even when I finished my homework, there was always more work to do or more studying to do, so free-time wasn't as stress-free."
"That can be a hard realization to have, and good on you for facing it directly. 

I know you are scared of being alone. Being alone brings up all sorts of insecurities about whether we can be loved, if we will ever find another person to be with, if we can even have a worthwhile life. 

The choice to end a relationship when it is no longer working is about realizing your own self-worth and understanding that you deserve to be happy, and that happiness is not solely dependent on being in a relationship. Happiness can come from many different places in this life, and a relationship can be just one source of happiness among many. "
"But do you guys talk about the real serious stuff?  Have you talked about getting married?  Moving in together, even?  Living together is so much different than spending the weekend or going on vacation."
"DO NOT listen to this advice, OP.   
While telling your wife may make stur things up again briefly, it will show her without a doubt that you can be trusted to be totally transparent with the aftermath of your affair.    
You knew it would take work to make things right. This is part of the work. Don't take the easy way out. God forbid some day it comes out that you got this email and never told your wide. THAT would take you back to square one.

'Ignorance is bliss' is the kind of thinking that leads to lies and mistrust."
"Or if he genuinely has no idea, he needs to be more proactive about talking to his managers about his performance and how he can improve.  He can't just keep falling back on ""they don't like me"" without recognizing he's the common denominator in all these situations, unless he wants this to keep happening."
"Never say never about the music. If that's what you really want to do, you should pursue it. I dabbled a bit when I was younger and I had a great time with it. Never turned into a proper job but I made some money, met a ton of great people, worked with some musicians I idolized. I don't regret it at all."
"Community college is a fantastic place for people who have little direction in life. It's not designed for you to stay there and graduate, it's designed to open you up to the possibilities that the world has to offer. Once you find yourself, transfer your credits in general education to a different school, with better programs for what you want. Just make sure the community college you attend is properly accreditted."
"The frogs are an (amusing) distraction.  I am guilty of staying online too long over irl socializing, but I wouldn't tell someone it was ""work.""  If he's regularly canceling on you/blowing you off, that's the issue.  You need to have a talk about what kinds of time/social expectations and desires you have--if he's not willing to make moves to reserving some time for you that you can count on, that's where the problem lies.  It would be the same if his hobby was fantasy sports or science-fiction worldbuilding or philosophy or cute animal photos.

If the dinner was a one time thing, I'd probably shrug it off--although I wouldn't be happy being told he was working--but if, as you say, this is an ongoing problem, you aren't being unreasonable--but you do have to have an actual conversation articulating what you want and need, because clearly he's not going to intuit it.  

Your feelings are that it doesn't seem like he's making you a priority in his life, more or less--whether he's showing that by canceling plans or by not being willing to make them in the first place.  It has zero to do with frogs."
Just a headsup that sub is also filled with lots of never-muslims that are just internet atheists looking to shit on being muslim altogether.
"It's like I'm taking crazy pills. My husband was right there with me, he helped clean up my sick, one night he shampoo/conditioned my hair cause I was so tired. Could I have done it? Yeah. But it was really nice to have him do it for me."

"It's not about the scholarship interview, it's about feeling like you're slipping away from them and growing up too fast and you're going to forget about them entirely. 

They feel the separation. They feel the disconnect. That's what they're reacting to, not the vague slight. "
"So her response to being told you have a problem is to gaslight you, then make it about her issues so you feel obligated to comfort her...everything but actually addressing the problem.  Mental illness may explain her actions, but it doesn't excuse her refuse to work on or even acknowledge them.  So why are you going out of your way to look out for her when she refuses to do the same for you?"
"Simple except for the fact that putting it simply and concisely didn't appear to work with an overly enthusiastic and oblivious spouse. 

Asserting yourself is all well and good when it's effective, but this entire post is all about why it hasn't been effective. Therefore, you give them a bit of an info dump about 1. tired 2. kids at adult party, and 3. work for me, spin the web a bit to make him think he's a hero despite essentially telling him he's being a bit selfish by expecting a newly post-partum mom to drag kids along to a party she doesn't want to go to, and then offer up a low-key solution so he can see she's not avoiding her ex or socializing altogether and then putting him off the hook by thinking him going out alone is both fun for him and a gift for her... 

It's presenting the problem, proposing an alternate solution, and reassurance that everything is all sewn up without giving him the option to disagree. 

When speech is made, it becomes a matter of, ""No, no, I insist, I'll have a better time home with the kids."" Which is true, and allows for more firm insistence if he's that obtuse... 

What we have here is a man who is probably perfectly decent but can't see beyond the end of his own nose in terms of foresight and social intelligence, and sometimes the only way to get them going in the direction you need them to go is to hit them with a blinding flash of info and wiles, and spin them off to stumble in the right general direction. 

See, the thing is, all evidence points to the fact that OP's husband *doesn't* think. "
"I was in the military for 5 years. I talked and acted very much different around military buddies and their families than everyone else. If I were to joke with people outside my social setting the same way that I did with the people inside, it wouldn't be acceptable, it would just be me being a fuckwit. I certainly don't expect anyone to treat me like I have aspbergers or something and give me a free pass to say inappropriate shit just because I'm too stupid to realize not all social settings are the same. OP is right in her actions. "
"I think you, and most people responding under you, are mixing up a ""Professional"" reference with a ""Personal"" reference.  The OP could be a good ""Personal"" reference and speak to her character and general personality.  Unfortunately, the SO used him as a ""Professional"" reference where the OP is staking his ""Professional"" reputation on supporting his SO (not to mention, based on the field/job, favors or favorable consideration may be required to move forward).

The difference between those two types of reference is spectacularly stark.  The OP's word/reputation can be dramatically hurt if he backs his SO without knowing what type of work product she can actually produce."
"It would be really obvious as to who you're talking about though, especially if you add ""there's no easy way to put this"".

Don't make it seem like a negative. Say it matter-of-factly, as it's a matter of safety. The ""nice"" part can come in the form of directing the person to a rental place or helping them find other equipment."
I think it very likely you actually DO know the answer to that question - that you can probably guess. 
"My eyes just rolled so hard I saw my brain.  You aren't his mother, he's an adult, capable of taking care of himself.  If he can't get his ass to class that's his problem, not yours.  "
"No. Your mother has a mental illness and you will not be able to cure her paranoia with a reasonable conversation. Her only hope to save her marriage is to seek treatment, but even then I'm sure your father has had enough and is entitled to seek his own happiness.

Your siblings are young and, while they feel justified in their reactions now, may feel differently over time. They've been subject to their mother's mental illness and she hasn't done anything to try and rectify it. They're also entitled to want some space."

"I know. It's not fair. My husband took our daughter to the pediatrician, and she kept telling him to make sure mom does xyz. My husband called her out politely. He would also take her out with him on errands and such quite often and people would ask if he was babysitting. He would tell them that he was doing his part as a parent, and that parents are not babysitters ever. These weird attitudes that men are somehow unable to enjoy or care for children  is pretty vile IMHO. Painting any man who likes kids as a pedo is even sicker.  Expecting men to not show any emotion but anger is a boil on the ass of society."

Apply the money to the security deposit? I think the best course of actions is for Brianna to reimburse OP and roommate for the months of rent they paid when someone else was living in their rooms.

"Are you really gonna be mad at your lingerie model girlfriend for being nude on a *nude beach*? If you had a problem with it, why were you planning to go there in the first place?

Her job is basically to have strangers stare at her body. She gets paid for it. She is perfectly allowed to do the same on her own terms and personal time. 

She is obviously and understandably more comfortable doing so than most people would be. She was ignoring the people trying to flirt with her. What more do you want? She's not ""yours"" now.

If you're not ok with your girlfriend making her body visible for the staring of strangers, you probably shouldn't be dating a lingerie model? Uh.. Duh?

I agree with you about the negative effects of spanking but want to point out and emphasize that the kid *was slapped across the face and upside the head*. That's a whole other level of physical abuse.

"So it has been 2 months. You need to think what is good for you. I was in a similar situation and there comes a point where you need to move on. You cannot wait for this girl forever. There is plenty of fish in the sea and other girls who would want to be with you 100%. 

You cannot let her lead you on like this forever. Life is short, do not waste it."
"I have to agree with your statement that OP is getting ahead of himself. I read the post thinking that OP had already met her in person before. What actually is going on here is an Internet relationship. Basically online dating if they've never met in person. And I have to say, with the technology today, it's very easy to be misled on how someone actually looks. I've had a few Tinder dates where the woman looked somewhat like her pictures but not as nice because she spent time picking the right angle. OP might end up not clicking with her in person too. It's a different experience when you're actually with someone rather than either messaging or skyping them over the Internet."

Just make sure you've had a nice haircut, wear a lovely shirt (and iron it), a splash of cologne and shave freshly that day or trim your beard and I know it's easier said than done, but just try to be even a little bit confident.

"&gt;He has brought up multiple times in a ""joking"" fashion how I should be happy he's faithful to me because I'm a ""depreciating asset"" and he's only getting hotter and he could easily find a 20-something girlfriend who is ""tighter"" (I have no clue if he means vaginally or muscle wise and I don't want to know) but he isn't doing that because he's a man of character.

So this is all new behavior?  Does he have a brain tumor or something?  If my husband started to say things like that, he'd better hope he has a brain tumor.  

It could be that he's just insecure and going through a mid-life crisis, but that's no excuse to behave like an asshole.  He's being insanely insulting and disrespectful to you and your marriage.  You need to stop putting up with this behavior.  I would insist on couple's therapy and that this behavior stop IMMEDIATELY.  This needs to stop NOW.  If he says ""I'm just joking."" Tell him, ""Jokes are supposed to be funny.  This is not funny.  I don't want to hear it ever again.""  

If he continues to behave oddly, I would insist he get a cat scan or something, too."
"No it's not, it's saying that she cannot be truly happy and secure in a relationship without marriage. People have dealbreakers like this all the time, and it doesn't mean they don't love the person. It doesn't mean that they care more about the dealbreaker than the person. It means that it's a crucial, nonnegotiable part of a relationship for them.

"&gt;To me it's kind of fucked up that you view it this way. My sex drive is ridiculous. I know that. I've told her that I understand that. This isn't fair for either of us which is why I'm trying to find a solution. I'm not saying it has to be something she does, I'd be willing to do something as well, but I don't know what I can do. 

Newsflash: High libido means your body wants to orgasm frequently. This does not need to involve a partner if she's not in the mood! I'm pretty sure you can stay monogamous and not go insane, despite frequency dropping to every second day. Masturbation is a thing. THAT'S what you do if you're feeling antsy and she's not.

I have recently moved in with my HL male partner and adjusting to living with him has meant that with fatigue and work and gym and more non-sex quality time together in general, frequency has dropped from every day to maybe five times per week. 

However - he doesn't pressure or guilt me into ANYTHING if I'm not enthusiastic about it. Your girl needs to feel like she's not just a tool for you to get off. 

Living with you might not be all candy and rainbows, and that will show in her showing you affection and intimacy. How are things otherwise?

"I am surprised that I am agreeing with you, but pretty much yeah."
"Then let them die.

The answer is not to simply cook for them at their whim.
Absolutely not. This guy is clearly lazy about cooking. 
The answer is to show them you are not going to give in and show them they can do it. If they still refuse, then I go back to my initial point, let them die. 

Op. Do not let him double you into always cooking. He can learn how to cook. 

If you are really believe you want to stay in this relationship (because honestly, I believe you should end your relationship), then one night when you are both home, teach him. 

Have him do a simple recipe from the very beginning to the very end. Be there to guide him through every step and help him whenever he gets stuck. Be as detailed as possible, so he can't give you one of his awful excuse (oh I can't do this! F that, F this!). 

Have the patience of this world and do not lose your cool cause that would be his perfect exit to continue being such a baby and such a disrespectful idiot. 

If even after you have honestly tried to teach him how to cook basic meals he is still ""meh, I don't know how to cook, F that! F this!"", then that would be your cue to get out of that relationship. 
Because it will only get worse. 

Edit: When you are teaching him, do NOT do ANYTHING. Not a single step. Be nothing but a voice that guides. If he gets desperate, just keep your cool and explain the step and what he should do all over again. 
Imagine you are dealing with a stubborn child. They get desperate really easily when they are ""stuck"" or simply want people to do stuff for them. Key is to let them blow it out and have patience. Never lose it with them, because it gives them the perfect exit to the situation. ;)

Wait - you're getting your MBA but also considering having a kid with a married man 20 years your senior? Where does your MBA plan fit into that equation? "
... I hate to plant this thought but how do you know this was the *only* guy she fooled around with? 
"Yup, all of this. OP needs to run. The difference between BDSM and abuse is consent. It is fine that he has a humiliation fetish (I personally wouldn't date someone with it but there are people who are into it). However, he needed to be up front. By skirting around the issue, he didn't give you the chance to consent. He engaged in his kink without your knowledge. That is so gross and creepy. Others are telling you to talk to him. I don't think he deserves that. This man clearly has no respect for you. "
Sometimes red flags don't come out for a while.
Baby steps is a good suggestion. Can you reach into his pants and touch his bare penis? Use some nice lube and try that. Tell how how much getting him off turns you on. How much you'd love to see him come. See where you can go from there.
How times have changed.  But I agree completely.  It is crazy to get married before you have lived together for a few years.
"&gt; school counselor

YES!"
"&gt; I worry that if I don't wear the headpiece, she will forever have the resentment against me.

You and I both know that she's already *chosen* to resent you. 

There's *no* way she couldn't have known that wearing the same headpiece (exactly the same as your custom request) three days before the wedding would bother you. No way at all. She could have worn something different, but she chose to make the identical same one that she made you. She could have brought up her intentions with you and asked for your blessing. She could have recieved your text with grace, apologised and offer to wear a new headpiece, or just go, ""Whoops, I'm sorry I didn't think. I'm glad you're okay with getting a new headpiece.""

Instead, she maneuvered a situation where, either way, she gets to come out on top. If you wear the headpiece, she gets to feel smug that she wore it first and everyone's going to assume you copied her. If you don't wear it, she gets to make a big fuss that her stepdaughter has *rejected* her, after she did *so much* work on it for you. 

She is obviously bitter at not being the centre of attention - my guess is your father is incredibly excited to celebrate your wedding with you, which is why she feels the need to bring his attention back to her.

She made the situation, it's not up to you to unmake it. She is going to be better and resentful *regardless* of what you do, so you might as well take the course of action that makes *you* most happy. I was quite sad to hear that she made her own headpiece based off *your* design, so I'm really glad you've picked one that you like even more. 

It's a real shame that she's chosen to make this gift, what could have been an olive branch to ease your shakey relationship, into a new thorn in your side. But that's her pettiness and immaturity coming through, and it's not your problem.

"I hope you see the above comment u/usedanddisrespected. Oh my heart just goes out to you. My sex life is only back on track about a month and our son is over 1.5yrs already. It never even crossed my husbands mind to approach me for sex for months after having a baby, our days were too full of dirty nappies, crying baby, tender breastfeeding boobs, flabby post baby body, sleepless nights and everything else adults have to deal with even when you don't have a baby, sex just wasn't on the agenda. Neither of us minded though because we were busy bonding and laying the emotional foundations for our family which was so much more important than bumping bits. It sounds like your husband doesn't particularly care to bond with either you or your son (not sure why you had kids) and that's just tragic. In fact it sounds like you're of very little use to him as anything other than a sex doll.
I think that probably sums up my advice too, buy him a blow up doll and leave it at the house while you take your son and go to your mother's. You need space from him and a proper support network while you sort your head out. Best of luck OP."
"You don't know before but the next time I absolutely refuse. As for enabling, society has enabled men to behave badly. I'm treated far worse when I'm jogging or at uni by guys than at work. And all my non sex working friends have come across guys on tinder etc looking to cheat o their wives. It's not unique to sex work. The part that is unique in my experience is clients (&amp; other members of society) thinking because of what we do, we don't care. peopke love to blame the other woman/the sex worker. We don't want anyone's husband! They'd stop paying us! 😂"

"Thank you, really.


You know, I found that most times when someone asks for advice they already have a decision made, they just look for the confirmation.


I do want to remain in this relationship, but at the same time I know my patience is draining, I'm growing, my needs and wants are growing, yet this is stagnating. I don't want to end up resenting him.
He really is a great guy, I know a lot of people say this, but I believe the world is a better place with him in it, just not the economy :D



We've talked about it, every time he asks me for financial help I tell him what an impossible and completely awkward position he's putting me into. And he agrees - with that said, nothing changes.



There's no question as to what my opinion is about all of this. I don't beat around the bush, but I try not to nag him either.
What keeps me going is that I keep thinking ""it'll change.. right?"", but then... what if it doesn't. And that's when I get a mild anxiety attack.



He said in the past that he thinks the only way to save our relationship is if he closes the business.
I think in the back of my mind I know that if I stop helping financially it will get the ball rolling towards a breakup, and what then?
What a shitty thing to say, when you type it, sounds awful, it doesn't look as bad IRL, but maybe I'm delusional. 



I don't expect to receive anything back by the way. I know that when I give away that money it's gone for good.

Thanks again"
"That's what I'm going to have to do.  I have to take control.  I just have trouble doing this because I am extremely non-confrontational and passive-aggressive.  I will let things slide to avoid conflict.  But I need to do this.

He is 4 years from being 40!! That's what turns me off the most.  My dad was always super responsible and provided well for his family.  I don't even care that he can't provide for us the way my dad did, but damn, just pay some of the bills please!"
"He needs to know how serious this is. If it's within 30 days, he may be able to return the TV &amp; computer. 

Honestly, OP, I'd choose staying married to a cheater over your husband, if he's unwilling to change. Being married to a cheater is personally painful, but doesn't risk having your three children end up homeless. "
"Right? After reading the title on the main page, I thought ""Why the hell would the sister admit that? Must be a weird situation, better read this one..."".

Then I opened it up to read it and... nope. No weird situation. Sister reached out to OP unprompted just to give her a little head's up that she wants to fuck OP's BF. 

How fucking selfish can she be? She feels guilty for being attracted to her sister's BF, so her bright idea on how to assuage her guilt is to put this shitty burden on OP? Damn. "
I was thinking the exact same thing. 
Then sign language sounds like a great idea!
"Well, it seems like there are two different issues going on here. The question of you not being invited on the trip seems to be more about a group decision not to bring SOs along. If you are going to be mad at him, be mad at his friends too, because it seems like everyone is enforcing the rule. It sucks to be excluded, but life goes on. Maybe take yourself on a nice vacay with friends during that time. 

Frankly, the issue of him not paying the bills is a lot more troubling to me. You need to sit his ass down, and get him to commit to XX portion of the bills. Why has this not happened yet?!"
"Honestly it sounds like there may be strippers there. And, really, I would have an issue with a 14-year-old being around that as well. I'd also have an issue with your cousin, but less of an issue than with you - there's an ocean of development between a 14-year-old and a 17-year old. "
"So instead of trying to share this with her, you resented her for enjoying it on her own because it took time away from you?  Maybe you would have really liked the show if you had given it half a chance.  "
"&gt;The remainder of the trip I received no apology

Nor do you deserve one. You're a big girl who apparently is a bad ass partying machine. If you go too deep and can't handle your alcohol, how dare you blame that on your friend. That's so unfair of you to try and make it someone else's fault that you got completely hammered and couldn't keep your **** together in a foreign country.

This is on you, not her. You were the reason this happened, not her. She is not your keeper. You are. 

Don't you dare ask her to cover some of your hospital bill. The fact you are even considering asking her to do so is stunning and tells me you're either looking for a fight and get off on the drama or are just way too selfish to be honest with who was responsible for your actions. "
"r/leaves

It's easy for a pot user to convince themselves that because MJ isn't physically addictive, that it's 100% safe and won't affect your life. That sub is former r/trees users who don't use for one reason or another any more. Maybe either you can read to gain perspective of how to talk to him about quitting, or you can read together to discuss similarities, find similar people going through the same issues, find inspiration for quitting. 

About video games though- would it bug you if he watched TV instead of playing? If yes, then that's fine and I understand wanting your spouse to be more productive/proactive/involved. If no, you would prefer TV watching, that's a losing battle. My mom used to hate that I didn't want to watch CSI reruns with her instead of playing my latest game. To her, video games were lazy and brain rotting, when in reality I was much more engaged in my chosen entertainment, it helps develop or stimulate problem solving/reasoning skills, it keeps my hand fine motor skills sharp, and it also comes down to the fact that it was my chosen form of entertainment. 

Saying all of that, besides addressing the weed usage, you need to discuss expectations for division between chores, family time, couple time and personal enjoyment time. My husband and I usually each get an hour to ourselves after work, which we stagger with naps and bedtimes so the person taking their time doesn't have to help out with baby or second grader. This largely comes down to communicating needs, setting boundaries with drug usage, addressing any underlying problems (does he smoke for pain, depression, anxiety, something he should be seeking medical attention for instead of self medicating?), and finding a balance with budgeting time spent after work.

Good luck. "
My cell phone is in my name but my bank account is joint with hers. I'm pretty sure I can get it removed but it can't be right away.
"Your wife being a perfect match is complete bullshit. You wouldn't know unless she was tested for it. It wouldn't surprise me if your MIL was dying, and she wanted to ""make amends"" before she passes away. That is a decision that only your wife can make and it's so fucked up how they're pulling the ""your mom is dying and your wife is the only match for her"" trick so your wife would want to visit her."
You're creepy. Do you get mad when she has her period every month too?
"This is tough. Both of you will have to compromise, you with being nicer and such with the in laws and her with setting boundaries with her family and holding them accountable. The thing is you are generally in the right with what you've written so far, but your reactions and outbursts make you seem mean. Tone those down and deal with everyone in a calm manner and you will be better off."
Stop talking to him completely and let life take its course. You can't babysit every potential partner he has. It's impossible. You have to worry about you now. 
"Honestly I know I will remember her as the woman who didn't let shit slide. I see a woman who reclaimed the narrative. Rather than woman whose husband cheats and gets left, she is the one who left, the one who scorched the earth. People will always remember that she left him. He may have fucked around but lots of people do that without intending to leave.

Nothing lasts forever. She gets a moment to hold onto where she let hell loose. Sure he'll get over it but by then so will she."
"OP, I sorta think your audience at your ""for show purposes only"" wedding deserve something to entertain them if you're perpetrating a fraud by making them believe this is a legal marriage.  I'm afraid that I think your thinking is even more skewed than his and that this whole fake wedding idea should be dropped.  Now, if you want a ""Commitment Ceremony"" with outlandish costumes and such -- go for it.  But forget the white wedding dress, and formally attired attendants.  It's a mockery."
"Wow, that was really awesome! I don't know who you are but I hope you have a career in counselling or as a therapist or something where you can help people. 

I'm on my way to work now. I will do it when I get to the office.

I just got off the phone with him and I believe that he is truly sorry. Problem now is just me getting over it. Its not always easy when you hear the same words repeating over and over but I will try my best today to kill those thoughts as well.

Thank you for taking the time to help me find a way to make things better. "
"Yeah but it was like that when he met her so it really is just rude at this point to inform her of this. If he wanted someone with long hair, he should have dated someone with long hair. Pointing out some perceived physical flaw in a partner you have decided to be with is just mean. And trying to backhandedly tell them that they should change for you is controlling."
"&gt;be was understanding of the many ""quirks"" I picked up from then, like he never tries to startle me for fun.

Okay, kind of off topic, but do you actually have people startling you for fun? That's a pretty shitty thing to do to someone."
"That's awful.  Emotions aren't rational, but they do exist, and you can't just ignore them.  Love isn't logical, hate isn't logical, resentment isn't logical!  But if he doesn't start acknowledging your emotions, he's just going to end up divorced again."
"So if this is supposed to by quid pro quo, why didn't Auntie Clara ask your brother to be godfather and then regift back the money she gave him? &lt;\sarc&gt;  My advice, OP, is for you to resign as godmother to Mindy.  If in 16 years, neither your aunt or your parents have mentioned this expectation, then I don't think it existed.  And your response should be ""I think not."""
"She's 27, old enough to know better than to lie about this. By your age most people expect that the other person has a history, and it's not like you're religious or saving yourselves for marriage.

You could show her this Reddit post and watch her reaction. Maybe there's a perfectly good explanation that doesn't involve lying. Chances are however that she lied."
"I think it starts outside of reddit, though.  A lot of women wouldn't even post, they'd just go ballistic.

OP, I'm not saying you should go ballistic, but you certainly need to have a serious conversation with this woman.  "
"Yes, HE has had it, so she doesn't need it. His big day with his ex should be enough for her. /s

How do you even marry someone who thinks that them having a big wedding that was the best day of their life with their first wife means the next wife must put their dreams aside? "
The spin off is about a lawyer 
"I love everything you've written here, u/megatrain 

I'd also add that I could see that OP might have kind of been in a progressive reveal sort of situation, where the complete mess in all of its sorrow hadn't been communicated up front. Meanwhile, years have gone by, new relationship forms between OP and MIL, where MIL is in a better place in life, context of work, it goes well, etc., etc. It's complicated. 

I love this community in r/relationships, but life is so confusing sometimes. No one hands you all the data, fully tested and verified, upfront. OP was probably young when they got together, too, which compounded her naivete.

Has your husband ever considered talking some of this out with a therapist? He deserves healing and peace, whatever form that ultimately takes."
"She's justified in not going because she doesn't want to go. She said she just gave birth two months ago and doesn't feel up to going. Plus, I know his friend said bringing the kids is okay, but a 2 month old and 2 year old at an adult engagement party? I mean...."
"Nothing about their behaviour that you've described reads like rational parenting though. You yourself describe them as ""uncommunicative and neglectful"", but then also that  they always yell at your brother (is he actually poorly behaved or is he just never good enough in their eyes?) to the point where he actually thinks you're being beaten.

They've always been irrational. You've only just realized this because you always did what they said so they had no reason to unleash their irrational behaviour on you. This is the one time you did something they didn't want and look at how they behaved."
"**I would call off the wedding.**

 Getting married is one of the most important decisions you can ever make in your life and from this description, you two aren't exactly in the best place to say ""through sick and health until death do us part"". Call it off and ask her if she would consider going to couples counselling. Show her that you are willing to take action and not just say you want things to get better. If she refuses the counselling, ask her what she would like to do. I think you two can work this out but you will need to be patient. She might be feeling a lot of things right now."
"Be careful not to finger-spell exclusively, though.  If you think about it, it would be similar to someone t a l k I n g j u s t l I k e t h I s verbally which can get exhausting.  

I'm sure your efforts of actually taking the time to learn Asl would impress her.  Especially since it's just to get to know her.  It's sweet. "
"Death is hard.

Some people think the best way to deal with someone grieving is to give them space. A sort of 'they'll come to me if they want to talk about it' sort of thing. Especially if they're worried about coming across as overbearing or selfish trying to involve themselves in someone else's life when they're going through a tough time.

That may not be the case, maybe she's just impossibly self-absorbed and really doesn't care. 

But its a little unfair to pass judgement on her at this point.

Maybe reach out to her?"
SHE WAS SHOWERING IN HER OWN HOME HOW IS THIS SOMEHOW HER FUCKING FAULT OH MY GOD COME ON SERIOUSLY
The quickest way to lose a friend is to lend him money. He clearly doesn't think its a priority to pay you back since he's spending money on expensive luxuries. Even if he does pay you back your friendship won't be the same.
This is why Spock is asking her to share the things on the list specifically - there are some things you can't change that aren't a huge deal and some that are. It's impossible to tell if she's overreacting without knowing what the things are.
"This isn't a case of her parents ""embarrassing her in front of her peers."" They didn't show up to the school dance to ground her for breaking curfew or yell ""I love you sweetie"" out the window of the minivan on the first day of school. They were rightfully upset about a teacher being inappropriate with their daughter. There is absolutely no reason why any teacher should ever refer to their students as ""hot"" or ""delicious (*shudder*). The fact that this guy teaches vulnerable students makes it even more troubling. He needs to *go.* Her parents were more than justified and in a few years OP will realize how creepy that shitty teacher was and be thankful that her parents stood up for her."
"She won't listen to anything OP says, because he really obviously feels great disdain for her, and I'm sure that attitude comes through loud and clear whenever he talks to her.  That will make anything he says worse than ineffective, because people generally don't like to take advice from people who think they're a moron.  If anything, he'll drive her closer to this professor."

"Let me tell you from one guy to another, I was there dude. I was in your same shoes, two years ago! 

What's happening is this, you have a nice job, and your fiancée, she sounds like she does ok for herself but her and her group do not have careers (excluding the teachers- who are probably 8-10 years away from making good money). They have a fun job. They see your girl with a guy who can save up to do nice things. Pay off debts. Get a nice ring -that she likes- very important, SHE LIKES IT. They are jealous. They want you to say ""babe go fuck yourself if this isn't good enough for you. You can go live in a shitty apartment and date a waiter like ur friends and question your future....""  The second you do that, I guarantee one of the friends walks in the picture within 48 hours saying ""she was an asshole, I'd appreciate that. You give so much and you work so hard..."" 

So it's about them being jealous. Now... The thing is, you need to know where your girl sits on this. You need to flat out, spell it out. If this ring isn't good enough, take a walk. Sorry, but I'm not spending anymore time or money on you. You're free to go. You'll figure whether her friends have ruined her or not real fast. "

What caused him to try to hit the cop?? They couldn't have arrested him just for saying that.

&gt;  i m getting more mad that he didnt want at least give me a chance to make things better!

It sounds like he gave you a chance, not just any chance, but a six year chance! What do you expect him to do? Wait for another 6 years for something that hasn't happened in the last 6 years?"
"I wish she'd truly listen to you and follow your advice. From the sound of things, she won't, but oh, how I wish she would. "
Play the documentary Trophy Kids for your family.  It's on Netflix.  If that doesn't bring them around nothing will.

Then again, what can you expect from someone who relies on someone else to make them fabulously wealthy then uses it to preferentially treat one person in their family while ignoring the rest. She sounds like she has nothing to offer humanity."
"She sending him risqué pictures and videos. I would not be cool with that. My husband can have chicks as friends, whatever. If he crossed the line of actually receiving pictures from them and didn't shut that down immediately I would be LIVID. 

He says he doesn't mind if you flirt with other guys. It seems to me like he's using that thought process to justify what he's doing. 

Would he be okay with you getting sexual pictures from other guys? "
"Growing up in a broken family is far better than growing up in a broken home. 

You and your wife both deserve to be happy and if you guys can't be happy together then you need to be on your own.

You could damage your kids emotionally by staying with someone you don't love. Is that what you want for them? "

He checked the phone usage, and went through your phone? That's barely ok when you are married, it's not really ok when you are dating, and it's absolutely not ok when you aren't in a relationship whatsoever.

It's time you cut him out of your life.

"
There's no way that this will work out if you fuck somebody else.
"If you knew someone had those problems and they needed help?  No.  If you suspect they do based on one interaction, then told you the real horrible reason behind it, but you go ahead and ignore them and reach out to the parents anyone and turn it into a big ordeal that wastes everyone's time and forces them to tell strangers a terrible story about their past? Yes."
"She has pretty low self-esteem, sounds like she's really depressed about the situation but is bottling it up, you suspect her of possibly being on the spectrum... We can easily add stress and anxiety on top of this. That plus with the self-esteem issues she's absolutely comparing herself to you even if she doesn't mention it, and probably feels trapped. I think her going to talk to a counselor is a very good move. All these things are things that are getting in the way of a healthy relationship and marriage. She's gone through a lot of jobs and been fired from three separate places (or is it four now with Edible Arrangements?). Perhaps the things you both desire in a relationship and in yourselves/each other don't match up. "
"""Rebellion"" is for dirtbag teenagers, not grown men with big responsibilities."
"OK, that's good that you don't intentionally make passive aggressive comments...but that IS what your question to him was.  What did you think he would say?  ""No, all other women who don't look like you are gross.  You are the only hot woman"".  You would know that was a lie too, so you trapped him with a question that only had bad answers.
"
"Take the porn out of the equation, he is selfish, poor husband.  You have a right to be upset about it and want him to change.  "
"He keeps going back to drinking because he can have both drinking and you.  This cycle will continue unless you are willing to follow through with leaving, because that makes him make a choice.

Just know that he may choose drinking.  And that is not a reflection on you, at all."
In some countries churches get money from the government based on how many registered members they have.
"Make a donation to the charity of your choice, watch them get married, eat some BBQ. That's literally all you have to do."
"yes, worse is correct"
And be sure to follow up on your threat to talk to management if he doesn't stop. 
"There's being open to learning new things, then there's throwing a tantrum over having a simple, trivial task requested, with instructions laid out. Your average 8 year old can cook pasta with 100% less complaining than your fully adult partner.

The only 'reasonable' excuse I can see is that he is deeply ashamed of himself for not being able to mentally handle a task that a child could easily conquer and is lashing out at you to cover his inadequacy. Or he is simply lazy and wants to be mothered or catered to for the duration of your relationship. "
"Right now you're hurting. But, if you had another young girl interested in you, you'll be fine. But, you won't get there by wallowing in self-pity. You're young. You've not yet experienced too many breakups. You may have thought you'd be together ""forever"". 

So, no it's not easy to move on, but it is necessary. Get out make yourself available and open to new experiences and, above all, remember that you're young. You can take the opportunity to find someone else - or 10 someone elses - until you're older and ready to settle down.

Losing a loved one is a bit of a mourning process. It sucks, but it's necessary. After all, you would not feel the way you do, if you did not care deeply for her. Once you move beyond the mourning phase, you'll be open to meeting other new potential mates. That's the time to evaluate, carefully, what role in your life you'd like that potential mate to take.

Good luck. "
"Sorry if I sound like an asshole but....

If they cannot take care of themselves as it is, why do they think that having more kids is ok?  
Now they have one that is special needs? How is that child ever going to have any sort of quality  of life in this situation? Those poor kids....

Anyways, unless you plan on moving in and spending you life caring for these people, you need to start saying no. That doesn't mean tha you have to completely  stop being a family memeber, and doing normal family things, but the guilt tripping thing is bullshit. They are responsible  for their own lives. They are using you because  you are allowing it. 
Your boyfriend is right for being upset that you drop everything and run over there. Are you ready to lose him because your life is taking care of your brother and his wife who have been extremely  irresponsible?"
You probably got a very edited version of the story.
"Ehhh... you're assuming a lot without really talking to your brother, making excuses like ""his wife controls him"", also purely a guess, and bringing up things from aaaaages ago with your parents that are not at all relevant to the current situation. 

Why should you try to contact your brother in secret? Meet together, everybody, and talk, so that nobody can go behind someone's else back and tell another story to person X than they did to person Y. And I'm really quite sure that's what is  happening now. Your sister certainly didn't get her brother to take her in and threaten to call the cops on your parents because she told him ""Well, other brother played games and talked to friends and mum did the washing at 11 pm as always"", there has to be something different she tells him, and that, true or not, bred the tension that led to the escalation you saw happening recently.

That said, a meeting or open talk will only do any good if you and your parents have an interest in trying to salvage some kind of relationship with your brother and sister, but it doesn't sound like it.

I get it, you are mad, your parents are mad. If you are truly that mad and believe nothing can be done, why this post? Then the only issue is the question of paying support or not, and that is beyond reddit's scope to decide."
"What do you think a 36 year old man would have in terms of interest in a ""friendship"" with a 19 year old girl? Just curious what you think from your side of the ledger. 

There's always almost an angle. He said he's unhappy in his marriage yet? "
"May I suggest offering your number instead of asking for hers? As a woman that would make me feel more secure and safe, it's less confrontational. "
i wonder what your mom would say if she saw that text. 
"&gt; but I don't believe it because I don't think he'd go for a girl like me. 

That's a bad mode of thinking. Your thinking should be something along the lines of ""I don't believe it because he is twice my age, he has a wife, it's gross and he SHOULDN'T go for a girl like me.""

"Yeah, she said he only overshares with people he loves, so he absolutely has a filter and the ability to hold it in. I have diagnosed OCD with intrusive thoughts as well, but they pretty much stay in my head."

"Hey! I totally get where you are coming from. You've got an education, a job - you're independent at 22 and that's something to be proud of. 

Onto dating, if you want to date you could try platforms like okcupid or bumble. Everyone is quick to shoot them down. However, you kind of get what you aim for. If you present yourself as wanting a relationship, you can achieve just that from it.

I wouldn't be worried that you haven't had your first kiss yet. It's entirely your choice whether you want to tell people or not. If you do, you can just explain that you were busy with life experiences.

However, don't do anything just to appease your family. Live your life the way that you are comfortable!"
"What constitutes 'a lot' of kids, exactly?"
"OP, you seem SUPER uncomfortable with Internet creeps/not close to the family people knowing anything personal about you or your daughter, particularly her face. I'm sure your girlfriend couldn't, in good conscience, disagree with posting her face for safety reasons. Maybe to compromise a little you could post a short status or two every once and a while that doesn't include anything personal or private, like ""Went to the park with my beautiful girlfriend and daughter today. Love them."""
no way in hell would i go out with someone a friend slept with.
"They didn't teach their kid not to do random drugs she finds by like, age 6? They should keep telling this story so everyone realizes what brilliant parents they are."
Would you think your wife did someone wrong if she touched another dudes dick?
"Think about this: he's using his mother's death to cover up the insecurity. 

That's pretty dispicable. "
"What the fuck, OP?!  How can you not see how fucked up that is?!"
"You're not the bad guy. You have every right to feel safe and comfortable in your own home. People don't owe ANYONE a place to stay for an entire week, not even their own mother. I don't like houseguests, and anyone who suggests sleeping in the living room is NOT helping - then everyone has to tiptoe around that person and you can't use the living room for what it's for.

Just, nope. It's your house, you can decide and anyone who calls you selfish doesn't understand what it's like dealing with someone in your home for a week when you can barely tolerate them."
Because he's not the one OP is being pressured to kiss and make up with here. His share of the blame is irrelevant unless we believe the sister is not a mentally fit adult with the ability to make her own choices.

I stared at that for way too long trying to figure out what sort of weird work thing that was before I realized it was an autocorrected ""attendance""."
"It is still best to get all of her ducks in a row because sometimes, depending on the regional laws, it matters in divorce proceedings whether or not there was infidelity leading up to the split. Additionally, if she is ever facing fraudulent claims against her reputation, any and all evidence of infidelity can honestly be used for personal reasons post-divorce to set a record straight if necessary. It's rare to hear someone as conniving and manipulative as her husband to just admit to everyone, ""Yep, I was a scumbag who cheated on my wife which led to a divorce."" I have heard stories of people trying to save face in whatever way they can- generally creating some kind of sob story about how awful the wife was and how she is lying about details of the affair. Helps to have solid evidence to combat hearsay and blatant gossip.

Definitely not OP's fault either, according to what she said at least I read it that he was separated (but still legally married) and they were involved and then married happily for over a year before anything questionable changed. It's not OP's fault she got cheated on nor was it something she could have prevented so I don't think ""Whatever, you knew he had shitty boundaries, this is what happens"" is helpful to OP either. EDIT: Yep, confirmed in the hidden comment at the bottom of the thread, *he was* separated while they were together. Honestly, it's not all that uncommon to hear separated people beginning to see other people as  they are only bound together by law."
"...and if you'd picked slacks and a blouse for the wedding, she should have sighed a little, shrugged, and told you it was an acceptable choice and that you looked very nice."
"How is working as a coordinator at an abuse shelter ""killing time""? Those types of roles involve an incredible amount of responsibility, not to mention often needing to be a liaison between managers of other companies and community organizations (law enforcement and judicial system comes to mind). 

She may be volunteering for this position, but in many non-profits the coordinator role is a paid position. With five years experience she could honestly have a paid job if she needed one. But she doesn't.

If I were OP, I couldn't be with someone who considered working full-time at a community organization doing important work keeping women and children safe from abusers as ""killing time"". It's an abuse shelter. She is literally working to keep people safe - sometimes in life or death situations. If you can't understand that, you're the one with the problem. "
I'm just going to throw in there that I live in a place where it never snows and it's hot as balls... I've never owned an electric blanket in my whole life
"The fact that you're concerned with whose ""fault"" something would be makes me think that you're not ready for marriage... plus the reasons your girlfriend mentioned, plus the fact that you talk about this in dramatic absolutes (ie. She loves me or she doesn't etc). I reckon you should count yourself lucky to have found such a level headed girlfriend who respects your relationship enough to give something as huge as marriage proper thought and consideration, rather than being swept up in romance. All of that said, it's obviously up to you, but I don't think she is being unreasonable at all, or giving you a reason to break up.
"
"&gt; Sorry you don't have the outlook that some people in your life are special and contribute positively towards your life that it is by far not a mistake that they are in it.

Dang man, that's clearly not what they meant. Not everyone thinks people show up for a reason, that doesn't mean they don't value the people in their lives.

Not pushing someone to discuss something personal is okay. That's all everyone is saying. If you agree with that, then you're not really disagreeing with anyone...

I agree with the poster that says taking control away is wrong. The best thing OP can do is offer a few words of support, and then give the (presumed) victim control over the situation back. She gets to decide what she does with her body, when she talks about it, and how much she is willing to reveal to OP on her own time. Taking those things away from her out of some misplaced need to be a hero and save her from herself is wrong imo. She isn't a drug addict, she's been traumatized by something. Forcing someone to open up to you won't work. She doesn't need to go to rehab before she overdoses or something, she's probably got self-image issues, and trauma, you can't force someone out of being traumatized.

Giving her control is the kindest thing he can do."
"Her down-to-earth-ness, wisdom, heart, spirituality and trust in the universe, kind heartedness, sweetness, loving nature, love for activity and nature is what drove me to marry her. I should drag her on dates more often though I do occasionally. I think you are right in that there is a lot more I could do to be better to her. Maybe I am focusing on negative things too much. "
"How did you even find out about it? How awful. That must have felt terrible and honestly, your sister got what she deserved. Once a cheater always a cheater. "
"Ya no, don't be an idiot. The fact you slept with you your step sister in the past is something that you are allowed to keep a secret. To the die you die if you wish. The fall out potential is too high. If you feel like you can trust someone your with to disclose that that's great, but it wouldn't be right away. Clearly he made the right call initially and it's shitty she found out and is being a shitty person about it. He should dump her. "
"What? No, that's not customary at all. And OP would have to *know* about these expectations in order to ""silently agree"" to them. 

&gt; If I were you I'd get her a nice gift because she is turning 18 and that's a big deal and she's family, but I definitely wouldn't spend thousands. 

This, here, is the best option.  However, OP, you need to recognize that the kid has been raised with some pretty hefty expectations that you weren't aware of... and there's approaching a 100% chance that the kid will be disappointed and angry at you. Try not to blame the kid; it's the way she was raised, and not totally her fault."
I make 300k a year and have nearly a million in my own back account. I'd never consider asking my father or husband for a handout. 
"Did I miss the part where he said he'd be going off to college soon, or was that an assumption on your part? Either way, OP, you need to move on to a better group of friends. Your current ones are assholes."
This is fantastic advice. I really hope OP reads this and takes it on board.
"Hold up...he's a university student?? If he is, then he is completely lying to you. He should have student insurance through the university that he can access to pay for medications and therapy. Most universities also have their own health clinics--he could potentially walk in today and walk out with a rapid referral. Also, he can access student counseling services through the university regardless of his insurance status."
"If I had received a book like that for any occasion, I would be incredibly touched and happy. Art or other handmade gifts are really special and should be treasured by the lucky person who receives them.

Your sister in law is a disgusting person and her behaviour is extremely tacky. Seriously only an asshole would prize a thousand dollar coffee maker over a handmade, thoughtful gift.

I can't believe they are calling you a gold digger when it is obvious that she is obsessed with expensive, costly things. 

As for your holiday - even if you actively chose to spend less on her wedding thats none of her business. Your life and money does not revolve around her wedding. You had every right to go and enjoy your holiday and you should not have to justify it to anyone.

Thats the last time she would receive any kind of gift from me. I hope one day she looks back on her behaviour and cringes.

"There's a really cool guy who makes flip books like this, not exactly the same thing, but pretty cool! I don't know if I can link, but if you google ""The Flippist"" he should be top link. Wanted to order one for my boyfriend before leaving for Pilot training, but they're $$$ (for an entry-level gal like me)."
"I would LOVE to have one of these books. We have young children and the thought of receiving one of these books for our wedding made my heart hurt a little. We would love it. So, so thoughtful and beautiful. Imagine reading your love story to your kids? Not only would they delight, but it could get passed down. 

Can I just suggest your husband make one for you three? You should post it one social media and let your true friends and family remark on how wonderful it is, while your miserable in-laws watch and fret over their material possessions. What shit people. 

Please show him your post. And if he is open to it, I really am interested. Please PM me.  "
"Worrying he will do it again is probably the biggest reason to end it. Especially since he doesn't seem to realise what he did wrong ""because nothing happened""

"If they want to take you to dinner, why does it have to be different places all the time?

Seems to me that the best way to manage a condition like this would be to find a handful of tried and true restaurants where you know you know you  have certain dishes that work. So you can order the Seafood A La Maison, and just tell the waiter to hold this or that ingredient if needed.  

If you can find 3 or 4 of those, that should be enough. Say you'll be happy to have dinner with them at any of those. 

If they are foodies that always want to try new places, fine, but they can do that with someone else or you can send your husband alone. 

If they are so inflexible that they can't make that kind of accommodation, won't let you have advance notice to scope out new places, etc., then they are just being very inexcusably rude. "
"I think your best bet is to get away. You don't want to be dragged into this. You have a four year old son who needs more attention from you than your wife at this point. What she does with her new pregnancy is little to none of your concern. I understand you may still have feelings for her but she's made her own choices that has put her in her own situation. 

TL;DR: Your ex has made her own choices, she can continue to do so. Focus on your 4 year old son, he needs you more than ever now."
"Re-read this, and think about the expectation you are setting:

&gt;the first time meeting someone off an app I only meet them for coffee and here I will insist on paying

Guess what kind of people go for a second date with a guy like that? People who like when the guy pays. You are self-selecting for a certain type of person.

Just order for yourself. If you are out at dinner, and the waiter comes, just ask the waiter for separate bills. Some women will mind, and those are the ones you don't want to date anyway. You are making this so much more complicated than it needs to be."
"SAHM here. I tend to do this with projects. Sometimes, it's a costume I'm making, or something crafty, or a home improvement project. Something won't work right I just freak the fuck out. (while no one is looking!) 

Especially, if it's something repetitive. That you just get more and more frustrated with. Once, my old sewing machine kept binding up while I was making a costume. It would bind up, I'd pull it open, fix it, try again. It was taking ten times longer than it should. Finally, I stood up, snatched the plug from the wall, and threw that mother fucker out of the back door. I ordered a new one on amazon and moved on. It felt great!"

"But on the other hand, it sounds like you have a degree and 5+ years of experience. If you ever needed to, you could get a similar job that pays a living wage. For now, though, you're supporting a worthy cause with your time, which is invaluable, and not taking a paying job from someone truly in need."

"It may save him money. He can get child support from her because you don't live with her. And if needed, getting a restraining order of some kind really doesn't cost much and is something a lawyer might not charge extra for. Most often its just a court fee that isn't much. 

If you are very concerned about the cost, you can ask your dad if you can get a job. You probably want one anyway to start saving up for your future. At your age you likely won't be allowed to work ful time, more like 15 hours a week while you are in school so a few hours a day. "

"Okay, but hopefully you recognize that your GF not giving you a heads up (and therefore avoiding a conversation about your feelings ahead of time), it's 100% her fault that you may not have been at your professional best in the call.  You were caught off guard; anyone would have been.  Perhaps that is part of why you are feeling so angry with her--she forced you to appear less professional than you are.

Also, I do wonder if you might be feeling a bit used.  It does sound like she put you down knowing that you're a big name in the field and would possibly earn her an interview.  It's not the worst thing anyone's ever done, but it's definitely not great relationship behavior.  She took advantage of your position and didn't even discuss it with you ahead of time because she likely knew you'd tell her not to list you.  She may act as though you're just being selfish or egotistical, but if she had thought what she was doing was 100 percent not shady, she would have talked to you first."
"When my now-husband moved into the condo I bought before we met, we agreed on an amount he would pay each month for rent, based on the mortgage payment but also our different incomes and the fact that equity was being built in my name alone. We split utilities and other household expenses evenly.

You've already said you don't believe he's going to learn new communication methods after all this time. He's already said he'll dedicate himself to changing, but only in the way he wants--i.e., without a counselor. So what are you hoping is going to happen by you sticking around and how long are you willing to wait to see if it happens? Part of the reason people get counselors is to have an infrastructure. You doing this on your own--and you've already said you expect the duty for this show to be mostly on your shoulders--means you've got nothing. Do you have a plan for how quickly you expect him to change? Or what it means for him to change? I think you're expecting this nebulous ""let's talk about our feelings"" to do a lot of critical work in your marriage, but you need a whole lot more than that. It's not just that you don't talk, but that your whole dynamic is broken."

If you divorce in five, ten years after having a child will he resent having to give your child financial support? How do you feel about this man having the house you want to raise your child? "

Your sister is really messing up. She's going to look back one day, when both of you are grown, and feel terrible that she missed spending time with you while you were kids. It's such a precious thing to watch someone grow up.

Maybe you should sit down with her and explain how it hurts your feelings when she ditches you, and that you won't keep making plans with her just to be let down. Have a serious conversation. Tell her you love her and that you just want to spend time with your big sister.

Additionally, you can't just say ""I can fuck other people but you can't.""  It just doesn't work like that.

"Thank you for so eloquently stating this, I came here hoping that someone had already posted it. 

I would NOPE the fuck out of there. The dude clearly can't communicate for shit, and degraded OP in the process. These, as Liz Lemon might say, are Dealbreakers. "
"A lot of guys don't grow up with much of an opportunity to experience deep and platonic friendships with girls so what sometimes happens is when they meet a girl like your girlfriend who is friendly, conversational, and is someone they can develop a connection with. Those connections can become attachments and you'll wind up with situations like your girlfriend seems to deal with pretty often.

You will have to do some personal reflection to see why your response is to be insecure and defensive about the situation. It could be a subconscious trust issue you have with her, or you might somehow feel that other men being attracted to her somehow makes you feel less, or something else entirely. The only person that can answer why you feel that way is yourself.

I can understand how it's unsettling to you to hear about that whole abusive behavior she has to deal with. That has to do a lot with the culture of communication and entitlements and expectations made by men in interactions with women. Talk to her about that, and ask if she needs anything even if it's just an ear to rant to. You can't fix gender issues overnight but you can help provide a safe environment for her to talk to you."
"That's not okay.  If calling you names is ""part of his personality"", that personality is abusive, clean and dry.  OP, you don't deserve to go through this."
"I don't think the gay people comparison is fair at all. People can get put in prison/ killed for being gay in those countries, I can understand that.

All that's gonna happen to you is that you'll have to own up to your mistakes and you'll feel like a real big piece of shit (which you kinda are). Stop trying to make up an excuse to avoid telling her, that's just what you're doing now.

What about this, if you found out your best friend's girlfriend cheated on him, would you tell him about it? Of course you would, that's what friends do, right?

"
"I don't know if this would work, but maybe when you're getting freelance work, you could lie and tell her that the place your doing freelance with wants you to drive in. Then work at the library or the coffee shop or wherever. "

"This is well put, and really is what 'spouse before kids' actually means when coming from a therapist."
"First of all, $900 doesn't even sound like a lot of debt.  He sounds like he just want to have to deal with the kids by himself.  

He also sounds pretty controlling, in that you haven't been out with the kids EVER.  He hasn't ever cared for his own children on his own before?  Really? "
"Take off the rose colored glasses.  He is a mean person to put you through that.  There is a nice way to break up with someone.  Confront your friend nicely and find out if he is involved with or talking to someone in your group.  Sure, he's an adult and can do what he wants, but so can you.  Get the truth, and make sure you know who is really your friend.  No frenemies.  That's B.S.  "
Exactly. But you know 10 hours in the gym a day and some kale and activated almonds cure everything.
You already said Adam sabotaged one of your relationships before. How long ago was this? Would he do it again? Especially when he's the odd man out?
"While I don't believe you can say couples can never recover from cheating, in your case, it seems pretty obvious that your wife is a serial cheater. It seems to me that she may be incapable of changing. Thus, that leaves you in a bad situation.

If your wife cared about you and your children, she wouldn't be cheating. It's not always so cut and dried, but to me in this case, it is. Consult a lawyer ASAP, protect yourself and the kids and let her fend for herself. Keep the phone and take that to your lawyer. "

"If she has receipts, then why not?  I've taken someone to small claims, and the judge even added interest on top of the receipt values that I produced because he was so irritated by the gall of the party I was suing."
Everyone is capable of cheating. We're all human. Being aware of temptation and avoiding it is a standard part of being faithful. 
For two friends to share a bed? How is that weird? If there's room in a bed why would you make your friend sleep on a couch? 
"&gt; But we are mortified. And also, despite it ""not being a problem"" here on the island, it's certainly not going to fly on the mainland. 

Well, only if people find out. Something tells me that you weren't born somewhere where they keep really good vital records. Do you both have a birth certificate that lists your mutual parent? If neither of you do, then it's impossible to prove that you're siblings except by genetic test, and if you simply refuse to undergo such testing, someone would have to have pretty significant standing to be able to legally challenge your marriage, if you decided to marry.

So lie. His dad isn't in the picture anymore (it kind of sounds like he wasn't, despite how small your island being.) Secondary fallback lie - he's your cousin, but basically *everybody* from back home is a cousin, so that's not unusual. Somebody is going to have to be really motivated to prove your relationship is incestuous, at that point, and the only way they'd *know* is to be from your island, where nobody has a problem with it (which is not unusual in tiny island societies.)

Our social prohibitions against incest in the *modern* age are about issues of coercion, grooming, sex abuse, and power, not about genetics. Since you didn't grow up together, those don't really apply to you.

Another option is simply not to ever marry.

&gt; We haven't talked about kids yet, but what when that comes up? 

Incest doesn't make monster babies. It simply increases the chance that your child inherits recessive autosomal traits. But it doesn't *create* those traits, and the genetic risk can be known before you start. In particular, you'd want a medical history from your shared parent. Since you only share *one* parent, the risk of recessive disorders is reduced. And if recessive disorders simply aren't in your shared lineage, they're unlikely to crop up with the two of you. And look, if everyone on your island is as closely related as you imply, and which the lack of diversity would imply, then recessive disorders were pretty much a risk with *anyone* you might have children with from back home.

Yet another option would be to obviate the genetic risk altogether by the use of either a sperm or egg donor, or both.

All of this is to say - you have some options. There's no reason this can't work, provided the two of you are comfortable with it. But if you've lived away from the culture that accepts this, deeply embedded in a culture that doesn't, then the two of you might not be able to accept it yourselves, depending on how much of that view you've internalized."
"Next time say 

""That's so odd; a girl I know from [social group] used to say the exact same thing! I asked her why, and it turns out she was really insecure and jealous of my hair colour and was being super weird about it.

"As far as I know, there's no statute anywhere that codifies cheating and plagiarism as fraud and the act of committing them defrauding the educational institution. That's not to say that schools view it lightly. Generally, people found guilty of plagiarism are at the very least punished with failing the assignment, and in particularly egregious cases, failing the class or even expulsion from the institution. "
"Yeah I'm with you. I'm in the camp of ""if you didn't discuss exclusivity, you are only hurting yourself by expecting it"" - you don't own someone just because you want them - however that doesn't mean it's invalid to have your feelings hurt, and she was clearly being rude and inconsiderate (if it's even true she did these things). I wouldn't call it ""cheating,"" but it can still mean you might not be interested in her anymore because it hurt you; the labels aren't as meaningful as the actual situation &amp; how you actually feel about it, and how your discussion goes.

Agreed also on the ""slutty"" comment too. "
Red alert!! You have to tell her immediately! the clock is ticking!
This doesn't sound like it has anything to do with boundaries. This occurred prior to their relationship. This is about OP holding her to a different standard than he holds himself

"Probably ""well, she isn't much to look at."" smh"

"In that case, I would tell her that you simply can't afford it. 

You might have to find another job, but it's not fair of her to force you to pay for something like this suddenly. "

"One thing to keep in mind is that it's often actually harder for women to get these things because sociologically there's a lot going when people view women asking for raises/more time off. Employees statistically have more likelihood of giving these to men (men are still considered to be the breadwinners, etc.) than to women, so she may be concerned that they'll can her or make her life harder - admittedly, this is the same concern for guys.

Have you asked her why she's nervous? She may have seen another employee ask for similar raises and get hell for it. 

One thing you might be able to do is make a plan with her, talking about what she's done in the workplace that her employers probably haven't noticed -- a lot of work I'm assuming means she's working more hours than are expected perhaps? Have her show the value add to them -- i.e. she's taken lead on projects and she feels she's doing more than her initial job asked of her, and thus she should be paid more. She can also offer to take a leadership role moreso. "

"So, I spent about six months eating raw vegan, and it was awesome for me, so if she wants to eat raw vegan and you want to work with her to stop the insane weight loss and health problems, you could go the route of introducing raw vegan foods that will increase her caloric intake and provide the nutrients she's missing. Like, ""hey, I made you this raw vegan treat, I'm supporting you!"" but there are actual calories, fats and minerals in there.  As a note, I was recovering from a botched appendectomy that left me with adhesions and chronic pain, and eating raw vegan permanently fixed those issues for me - I am back the grilled cheeses and pizza and couldn't be happier about that.

Ehh... I get what you're coming from, but isn't this is a little harsh? Some people (lots of people, in fact) are bad with money; it doesn't mean they're bad partners all together or undeserving of love. It also doesn't mean that they're incapable of improving their financial situations. I'm sure that with good communication they can work through her problems together and get to a place where OP feels comfortable marrying her/moving in. No need for OP to run for the hills immediately like lots of people here are suggesting.

I don't think OP should give her the money either-- she got herself into this mess and she should get herself out of it-- but to burn the whole relationship down over the fact that she made some bad financial decisions and ended up in a bind is a little rash to me. "

"Attachment issues can often reveal deep-seeded problems with self-esteem. If you have been with multiple people in the past who have abused you, or those you love, horribly, and have not yet sought professional help, you have likely internalized that abuse.

Aside from therapy, I recommend trying to practice a little bit of self love each day. Even if he turns out to be no-good (which, by the way you describe him does not seem to be the case), the worst that will happen is you find yourself single. Being comfortable with and prioritizing yourself makes that prospect bareable - a lack of those things means you will continue to engage in controlling behavior and self sabatoge. For example, you mention being concerned when he goes out with friends and leaves you behind...but do you ever go out with your friends without him? If you did, perhaps it would cause you less anxiety and you would be better able to relate to his desire to do so once and awhile. There is absolutely nothing wrong with placing your partner as priority #1 in your life, but things can spiral quickly when they are your only priority. 

Recognizing that your behavior is destructive shows a promising level of reflexivity and a desire to change - now it's time to commit to saving your relationship before it goes off the rails; don't be afraid to seek out help, as that can be a daunting task without the proper support and guidance."
"I am a PhD so I was in grad school for a looong time &amp; I know what it's like to be so intellectually thrilled about learning due to an excellent professor, that it's possible to transfer that feeling to the prof.

"Yeah, it sounds like they're both deliberately doing things that they know that the other person hates. That's a problem. If OP needs space to clear his head (or even just to prove a point about her not sticking her fingers in his mouth), then he needs to tell her why he's doing that. He needs to say, ""If we talk right now, we'll have a huge, unproductive argument. I need fifteen minutes to clear my head,"" or ""I'm not going to talk to you or even want to lie next to you if keep doing something that you know that I hate because I've repeatedly told you that I do."" Of course, his wife's behavior definitely sounds like it's causing his, and she's doing nothing to convince him to change his behavior with her refusal to apologize and her persistence on doing things like turning the computer off. Then again, she likely is just as frustrated that he keeps doing the thing that he knows will upset her the most whenever there's a problem. (Although she's also causing the problems, so she doesn't have the right to get angry or aggressive like she does.) It sounds like the wife shares more of the blame here, but if they want to fix things, they both have to agree to stop doing things that upset the other to that degree and to learn to settle conflict better."
"Dump him. There is no other answer here. He's a selfish, manipulative scumbag, and you've been with him since you were a teenager, which only helps him take advantage of you. Get rid of him pronto."

"She can't blame dyslexia on not properly planning her time out. It's not like the deadline snuck up on her. If she knows it takes her longer she needs to take that into account. Talk to the uni or her lecturer for assistance and/or extensions.

As someone who is doing 80+ hour weeks due to full-time work and currently writing my dissertation, I am appalled that you wrote most of her dissertation for her. They are a test of our ability to motivate and organise ourselves just as much as a test of knowledge."

"First off, the friend zone is a horrible term to use. You are essentially admitting that you only see this girl as someone to date, and that *just* being a friend is an undesirable scenario. There is no such thing as the friend zone, those who are there were simply rejected and can't accept it. 

You can't force someone to like you, and if she doesn't show mutual interest then you have to accept that. Going out together is a good sign so keep doing what you did. Make sure though that the date has an element of excitement to it, something that makes her want more. Don't spend the whole date talking and reminiscing, create a fun memory. "
"&gt; but you can definitely limit things that might tempt you.

Yup, I feel like this is something a lot of people miss. How many times have people said ""I never meant to! It just happened!"" after they have cheated? Often their partner would swear that ""He isn't the type to ever cheat on me, I trust him.""

Limiting the situations you find yourself in that often lead to poor choices and mistakes is just being smart and respectful towards your relationship."
This is exactly what I was thinking. Them being juggalos is very relevant to how they are acting.
That's stripping any sense of context and subtlety out of the comment and conversation. 
I hope OP is reading this deep into the thread. They have a lot they need to work out before they sign a piece of paper tying their lives together forever.
"Yes, it sounds like she's doing a lot of the emotional labor in this relationship. On the other hand, I can imagine how her actions could be manipulative. She wants him to change. You shouldn't date someone with the goal of transforming them into someone else. They should break up, and he should do his own work to improve himself. "
"Might be worth exploring with friends and family what they don't like about him in a bit more detail, 'cause that's a lot of people that dislike him. It may be just as you said, but I remember when I was with someone who turned really abusive later on, friends and family picked up that he was low-level controlling and unkind from the start. I wish I had talked to them about why they didn't like him more."
"Sexual incompatibility is a real problem and a legitimate reason to stop seeing someone.

"She doesnt sound like a psychopath, more like her depression is awful and she doesnt know how to cope or deal with it. Take her to therapy, specifically behavior therapy. If she is open and honest with her therapist she can make some improvements"
"Explain that if the child had broken a customer's bike she wouldn't even get the benefit of a polite request to repay the cost and apologize, instead, she'd have found out about the footage from the court summons and/or a charge from the police for destruction of property. Maybe then she'll understand how generous you're being...

She really may have broken the law bringing the child into the shop if you specifically told her not to too - and what if her kid had gotten hurt? Would you have been liable if he'd hurt himself with shop equipment? What happens if you let this slide, she brings him back, and he seriously injures himself? She seems to think it's practically your fault this happened, so is she going to step up and accept the blame in that situation? "

"&gt;I'm not really a monster and he and I have a good relationship.

You don't have to be a monster to hurt someone. Good intentions and the road to Hell and all that. 

An abusers best weapon is manipulating other people. They're two-faced essentially, acting nice and kind to others and hurting their victims behind closed doors. Then when victims speak out or establish boundaries or try to leave, other people start invalidating their feelings or naively trying to destroy any boundaries. This stops the victim from acting and even worse the abuser can convince others to help them. 

You are naive and you've never been abused. You can't recognize when you're being played. Amy acts nice to your face and turns around and henpecks, criticizes and hurts your husband the moment your back is turned. "
"Someone did say that there is a lot of homophobia in Jamaica so that could be a link. But also he's just very territorial. Doesn't have a best friend or anything like that so I don't think he understand s how strong a friendship bond can be without getting sexual. I even asked him if he thought anything was going on and he said no that he just thought it wasn't normal. I don't think it's guilt or anything, at least from the vibes he gave off I wouldn't think so. I have a feeling it has to do with not having a best friend so he can't relate just how close one can be to one another. "
"Yeah I can totally see how that sounded contradictory. I guess what I meant to say is it seems so normal to me that I automatically assumed he always knew. Maybe that still sounds contradictory. Idk, So my fault on that communication part"
"Hey this sounds _exactly_ like my ex to the point that it could actually be him and let me tell you, it turns out I wasn't the only person he was taking pictures of/recording without consent. Go with your gut, he doesn't respect you and most likely doesn't respect other women either."
"&gt; If we gave her up she would go back to where we got her. He can control her and has a ton of land where he takes the dogs to run and play. She would have a good life for sure with hopefully less anxiety - we wouldn't be taking her to a shelter or anything.

If he's equipped to handle her, why did he adopt her out, and why did he lie to you guys about her history? Did you guys pay an adoption fee?

I ask because, given his less than reputable nature, this guy could possibly just adopt her out again (and collect 2x the fee from adopting her out) to someone even less equipped than you and your bf, and she could potentially seriously injure or kill a small child/another dog. 

For practical advice about the dog, I would recommend posting on /r/dogs or /r/dogtraining.

"I agree. She's doing this for your attention. You need to break up with her, and if she is a danger to herself, call the police immediately."
"So it's perfectly fine to judge people by hair color, height, weight, skin color, age, boob size, dick length, wealth, personality, and any number of other things, but sexual experience, nah fam, dats sexist. 

Let me also point out that this is not so much judging the person as a whole over their past experiences, but it's judging their compatibility with you as a significant other and potential sexual partner, which is *exactly* what you should do with anyone you date."
"OP says kid is 4'11 and 160, stating the family doctor labeled him as overweight.  So, it isn't necessarily imagined, but their approach is bullshit.  They chide him for being fat, blame it on him, go to elaborate lengths to lock up tempting foods, sign him up for activities without his input and then wonder why he's not happy go lucky about all of it.

I feel genuinely bad for this kid.  Wonder how they treat him when he doesn't get a good grade?  Tell him he's dumb and needs to study more or actually try to determine what help he needs to succeed?  I hope OP sees this and changes his tactics here, because his suck."
"&gt;they should acknowledge that a betrayal in a marriage is not the same as abandoning your kids.

Uhh, what? 

Considering that this kind of betrayal tends to lead to divorces and splitting up the family, how is this not relevant? Look, we're not saying they should have stayed together no matter how they felt, just for our sake. If she was unhappy? Fine, get a divorce. It'd have sucked for a bit, not gonna pretend it wouldn't, but we'd have gotten over that pretty quickly if they had split on good terms. This was just her putting some other man ahead of our dad, ahead of the whole family, and nothing more. We see that as abandonment. "
"It seems like you've made up your mind, and to be honest I don't blame you for not wanting to deal with his crap anymore. 

Being in a relationship and raising a child require partnership and mutual support - he doesn't seem like he can provide that."
I don't know I thought it was badass and the way he just came spilling out with it is hilarious you must be something when you're mad. Anger is justified sometimes it stops you from getting screwed over.The fact he had her picture as a lock screen ...what a sick fuck.
Just... wow. Just reading the sidebar made me speechless.  I guess people will believe anything if you're telling them what they want to hear.
"You need to talk to your mom.   I'm really certain your mom would not want you to give this information out to strangers on the Internet and would probably be a bit worried about them asking.  I would talk to your mom and then go with ""I'm extremely sorry,  but in respect to my parent's rules, I am unable to do this,  you are more than welcome to speak to my parents about this"" (Assuming your mom is willing to talk to this person,  but seriously,  this is weird and does warrant letting an adult know)"
"She doesn't have to justify her parenting choices.

This would put a terrible precedent for any other issue. Besides, the grandma likely doesn't nag because of actual concerns, but just to be controlling. "
Yeah ketamine is a really unlikely culprit here. The govt lists liquid k as a potential date rape drug but in reality it's not very good for that. 
"&gt; Wouldn't it make me look not serious? 

Quite the opposite. It takes a really strong person to step forward and say ""enough is enough"".

I actually (and I just mean this matter-of-factly) have **less** respect for people who just let shit go on when they need to just get it taken care of.

It doesn't matter what it takes for you to get this guy to fuck off - just make him fuck off. Tell him to his face, go to someone who can handle it for you, change groups - whatever you have to do! Your life is your own, and if someone is causing you constant discomfort - take charge of your life and take care of the problem. Whatever you have to do will be better than just ""coping with it"".

Best of luck OP, you seem like you have a pretty firm grasp on the situation."
Why are you dating someone who gets in fights?
"Consider counseling. Either to help you two navigate a divorce, or chart a new path to happiness together. You don't have to define the outcome when you start, and the two of you can arrive at the destination together. "
"The point is, you and your hair do not exist solely to attract men. Your reasons for having a short style are not founded upon, ""I believe that Tom, Dick and Harry find this to be the sexiest thing possible."" Your reasons are about comfort and maintenance.

It's inappropriate for Dick to be commenting on whether your style maximizes your appeal to men. It's none of his business. But he is a misogynist who believes that you, along with all other women, were put on this earth to give him a boner (or to give him someone to bring home to meet his parents). And that you're failing in this duty by having short hair. It's like you've taken something away from him that he deserves.

Your boyfriend may be dipping a toe into this kind of thinking. He's starting to go on a powertrip where he does find you attractive, but also wants you to believe you're lucky to have him."
"It's clear that he's cheating on you or at least intending to. You're not crazy, you have the evidence. Please stop wasting time procrastinating and deluding yourself. Tell him what you know without listening to his excuses, dump him where you are, and dump his beverage in his lap, walk out and leave him to pay the bill. He's a grown man he can deal with the aftermath of his shitty actions just fine."
"You might think you've done nothing wrong but you did. There is no reason why an older person should be having private email conversations with 12 year olds that aren't their own family. It doesn't matter what the subject is - it's not ok. As the coach you were in a position of power. It was your responsibility to keep communication to being about soccer only and to cc parents in. Private emails is how grooming starts. 

And don't say you were ""pulled back in"". You're an adult. You should have known better.

You have humiliated your daughter. This will follow her for a very long time. Her peers see you as a predator. Do you think they are being kind and understanding towards her or do you think they are giving her grief? Has she lost all her friends because of you? Can you blame her for not wanting anything to do with you?

Go see a therapist. They can work out a plan for you to properly apologise to your daughter and continue the relationship on her terms. Hopefully they can also help you understand why what you did was so wrong. "
"Well, to be fair, those are pretty drastic changes from what you were before, it sounds like. It's pretty easy to see how from the outside looking in you're making yourself over for your partner.

That being said, the only people who know what goes on in a relationship are the people in it, and outside opinions are almost always damaging to that. If you spend your time looking for validation or understanding from people outside of your relationship you're never going to be happy, because they aren't going to be able to give you that.

In my culture, it's considered wise and appropriate to, as a general rule, keep details and problems about your relationship to yourself and not share with others. The reason why this is important is because outside influences almost always aim (deliberately and indirectly) to cause strife and problems in other peoples' relationships. Sharing with others is known not to do because the instinct is to disrupt them (something like the idea of reaching out at all in itself indicates evidence that there is some underlying reason why you should break up and so that is the outsider's focus/plan when discussing the relationship). The idea of normally and casually sharing details about your relationship with outsiders is cautioned against.

You are probably going to need to start implementing this if people around you are only giving you negative feedback. "
"Um, no. It's her kid. She didn't want her baptised. Period. You don't baptise someone else's kid, or circumcise them, or cut their hair, or tattoo them, or perform Satanic rituals on them, etc etc. It's HER KID. 
It's like if I ever have kids, nobody gets to smack my kid, that is not how we're going to discipline my kids. Other people may disagree with that or think it's ""not a big deal"" but that's just how it's going to be with MY KID.

People get to make their own rules and maybe MIL shouldn't have made such a ""massive issue"" about having to baptise this child that is NOT HER CHILD.

"Talk to a lawyer and I fucking promise you, your husband was in on it.  Waiting for your response?  They had this planned??  Divorce.  Bye.  Doesn't respect you, your lack of beliefs, not going to stand up to his family.   Fuck I would be beyond infuriated.   Divorce.  Restraining order on the grandparent who essentially assaulted your child and falsified documents and bribed people to have her will fulfilled.   Get child support and do supervised visits only.   This runs so deep it will sicken you to the core.  Do not for a minute think your husband is innocent.   What a piece of shit."
"i actually found unused toilets on the fourth floor of my building. i can poop like 3 times before noon and have to pee like every hour. so being alone in a bathroom and doing your thing without having a coworker ""judge"" you relieves from the anxiety and embarrassment.

"He loves you just as much as you love him. As a human, he needs and DESERVES time with his friends. And imagine trying to plan a poker night with multiple friends during the weekday! Saturday has got to be the best, if only, option.

What are your hobbies? Just try spending some time focusing on YOU on Saturday. :)"
"She was looking at houses in the same suburb but when the latest one fell through he offered for her to move into the attached flat (which we actually really need for our own family unit for living and work space) despite the fact that just the night before I told him very clearly that I wanted to live with just us and no housemates. Unfortunately she is now excited at the prospect. She offered to help out with the kids which was very kind but I'm sure we can help each other out, as we have been doing, without all living together.

"Were you ever just friends with this guy or have you spent ten years at his side hoping/wishing he'd wake up one morning and realize you're the one for him?

Here's the thing about men...if they're interested in someone romantically, they don't waste time in making their intentions known. He found a woman he's interested in and here they are, barely a year later, getting married. And your ""friend"" is over the moon happy. 

You need to go no contact for your own well being. If you've not dated anyone during this friendship, you should give serious consideration to getting yourself an appointment with a therapist. Sometimes friendships grow into romantic partnerships. One key factor in both is honest communication. You weren't honest with this guy or yourself and now you're in turmoil and denying he loves someone else.

He wants to keep you around because he thought you were as honest as he is and you really are friends. You aren't. That's why it makes no sense to you and why you can't share in his joy. If you decide to be truthful now, things won't suddenly change (he's not secretly in love with you) and it won't be pretty. "

"Things rarely get better.  I'm sorry.  So few people in this world, who start out with an attitude like this, can calmly be shown a new perspective on things, or be willing to even try.  What you have described, OP, is so painfully immature that my advice would be for your BF to describe the aspects of his behaviour that are causing her pain, and if she can't observe even a willingness on his part to change, it's time to move on.  For the sake of the baby.  

You haven't mentioned but I have to ask, has the father even changed a dirty nappy?"
"Oh shit man, I hope things start working out for you eventually."
Unless it's Bruce Springsteen. 
I wouldn't like to be someone's maid. OP doesn't sound like their happy about that either so I don't think having him pay and do nothing will solve anything.

"Remember, he may be using this time to prepare for divorce. You should, too. ""Just in case"" it comes to that, see a divorce lawyer and make a plan. That way, you are being smart.

Of course he is not a monster, otherwise you'd have no reason to stay. But ""walking on eggshells"" is a sign of abuse; he has trained you to never express dissent, for fear of setting him off. The stonewalling is your punishment.

"I'm so sorry to make you feel that way, really, I apologize.

Probably not. My sister (who is a year older than me) had a part time job that my parents always argued with her over. My dad did yell at me to get a job before summer, and I jumped on that so hard that I filled out at least 7 applications. Not one response. Now the school year started, so no jobs for anyone. My sisters volunteer at a nursing home once a week, and they get to get out of the house a bit more, but my mom will hear none of it from me.

They don't want me in any classes, and I'm not sporty at all. I'm more intellectual and musical and into more social type fun, not athletics. Ugh, I just feel so weird and like a failure as a person for not being able to do anything."
"Just a little advice for the future. 7 job applications is a fairly small number. At a minimum you should be filling out 15-20 of you want a decent chance of landing something, and you frequently need to apply for more.

And the big thing is a week after you submit your application, go in and ask to speak to the manager and say you submitted an application and ask if there are any open positions.

When I was a teen I got a McDonald's job strictly because the manager was impressed that after I submitted my application I followed up with him asking if they had open positions."

I don't think they would be able to. It bothers me *a lot* that she doesn't believe me - but I'm willing to accept that she probably thought it was 'better safe than sorry' and that it wasn't out of ill intention.

"Yeah, I'm not being hyperbolic. I like drinking, and it's a great way to unwind. It is unhelpful to OP to suggest to her that her reasonable request is an unbearable load on her spouse when there is any number of other things be can do to chill. It's also inappropriate that his response to her compromise of ""please don't drink around me"" was ""ok I'm going to go out every other night and get drunk and let you go to bed alone every other night and also gripe about you to all my friends."" Doing this says a lot about what he will be like as a father given his apparent list of priorities, which right now looks like this:

"Well, you have three likely results that are going to come of this.  One, you have the baby and he eventually comes around and you guys go on with a merry life.  Two, you have the baby, he resents you and the child for tying him down.  Three, he leaves you and you have to raise the baby as a single mother. 

He really only has two choices... stay or go.  I just hope if he decides the former that you two can work through it together."
"No... I'll not tell you to suck it up... I'm going to tell you to quit your job.  You would be doing your boyfriend, boss, his wife and his children a favour by not being there because I think its rather apparent that you lack the maturity to shut this down.  Nothing, absolutely nothing good will come of this.  Best case for you is you and your boss end up together... but that's also the worst case because now you'll always have to wonder if he's fucking around on you behind your back with the new intern.

"Do these friends and family members think that actors who star in films together automatically go off and must have families together?

"Again though, whats the goal of the set-up? So they can both say ""haha got you!""? If they were cheating together then why introduce you at all and then later deny knowing each other. The whole suspicion around this is a little strange. I think the most likely situation is your BF saw her on some kind of social media of yours, thought she was attractive and managed to find some pics. I highly doubt your whole relationship with her is some kind of lie and this is probably just a coincidence or a snooping BF who decided to creep on one of his SO's friends."
Move out for god's sakes. You're not ever gonna convince someone to change decades of thinking. Don't waste your time. Your relationship with your mom is too precious to potentially ruin over something so easily fixed.
"Unfortunately, she's joined a scam. Sure, there's probably people who can make money on this but these are the people up the food chain. It's just pulling people off the street and using loads of talk and motivational conferences. If she's as big into this fitness and coaching thing as you say she is, see about broaching the topic of her becoming a personal trainer at a gym. At least they'll pay her hourly and she won't have to blow all this money on replacement shakes that aren't worth it. 

Having to pay to get into the conference along with paying for your own flight and hotel is just infuriating to me.

On the topic of formal education, that's subjective. There's nothing you can't find online or in a library that if you're dedicated enough, you can't learn on your own. And that costs pennies in comparison. "

Rubbing her back and cuddling and touching her hair isn't looking after her medically. It's just looking after her. Like a good caring boyfriend. She's probably is just more comfortable asking you to do some more medical things on top of that because you're exposed to that sort of thing and know some of what you're doing 
"Make rules. No borrowing money from anyone without asking you first. No buying anything on credit. A certain amount of money for him to spend as he pleases (except not as down payments, only as straight purchases). Giving the rest to you to pay bills with etc. Showing you receipts to verify that he's actually paying the child support he claims he's paying. (Any chance he's lying about the whole child support thing? Anyway, he could lie and say he's paid this month's when he hasn't.)

If possible, have him direct-deposit his paycheck into an account in your name, and then you transfer his allowance into his account. Maybe you should even take over paying the child support -- not as a legal obligation, just you sending the money on his behalf (so he can't spend it on something else).

Is it possible to return the tv and stuff he bought? Otherwise, I'm not sure whether he should make the payments for that out of his allowance, or you reduce his allowance and arrange the payments yourself (to make sure he doesn't spend the money on something else).

Talk to a lawyer about whether there are ways to prevent him from borrowing money, e.g. credit cards you don't know about. If it's not really feasible you might have to get a divorce."
Can you blame them for being terrible? Their mere existence is a sin against nature and have a constant struggle over their identities. Are they people with horse tendencies or horses with people tendencies? I can't imagine what they go through.
"Yeah, if my girlfriends response to an argument was to attempt to humiliate me or make me feel sexually inadequate I'd peace out."
"Good call. I've been married to my wife for two years and together 8. I've never once had a dinner with just one of her friends. It was never even mentioned. Not even with a group of her friends by myself. Not due to lack of friends either she's got a couple different groups from work and moving and what not she's in touch with daily. 

So this is very strange and attention grabbing by your friend imo. "
"I don't really understand why you need to be friends with her. Fine you're an introvert so am I. It's hard as hell to meet people and make friends when you really just don't like to be outside your bubble, but you chose to do so with one of the two people your husband wants nothing to do with. You need to stand by your husband. Damage is done with your kids. They are going to have to adjust and Abby's feelings shouldn't matter in this case. My husband doesn't understand why I hate my grandmother. He's met her finds her lovely but we're pregnant now and I told him she will have nothing to do with our child. Nothing. I don't care that she's the only great grandparent they'll have because she was an awful abusive person to me and my brother as children. Hell I have nothing to do with her now and the only reason he met her is because she was at a family funeral pulling her fake sweet grandma shit. You know what my husband said...""whatever you feel is best."" That's what you do when you are married. You stand by your spouse when there are things that make him/her upset. You're husband isn't just holding a grudge for no reason. He clearly has his reasons for his lack of relationship with both of them. "

"Jumping on this, OP... I'm a teacher in the UK and can give you a little bit more guidance regarding the provisions available for kids in your situation. We're now trained to spot kids in your predicament, because there are now laws to protect you. The Serious Crimes Act 2015 now makes controlling or coercive behaviour of a partner OR family member a criminal offence. I can't link the document here, but if you google the statutory guidance framework for the Act, you'll see your parents fall within the remit of a number of offences. The law is on your side, and the Act was introduced to specifically address this kind of abuse. We teachers are also trained to spot potential enforced marriages as well as radicalisation (I don't mean to generalise but this all falls under our safeguarding statutory duty of care). You CAN report this kind of abuse and you, as a vulnerable minor, WILL NOT be left in your parents' care. I appreciate your school may not necessarily fulfil their duty of care in acting appropriately to any disclosure you may make, so I advise against speaking with a trusted teacher, however, you can contact the NSPCC for advice, and they will help you get out safely. It's free to call, and completely anonymous if you wish. Feel free to PM me if you need any further information. Good luck and stay safe. "
Why do you think your boyfriend can read minds? 
"My dad died of lung cancer from smoking. Tell me how attractive that is.

I also don't think this girl needs to feel bad because another girl smokes cigarettes 'attractively.'

"
I see C as the most likely and reasonable answer. The tension is just going to have to be tolerated. It would be unfair to deprive his son of half his family and culture but at the same time his son deserves a balanced life without the sins of said culture. 
Yeah I actually wondered if I was going to see the plot of The Slap in the OP hahaha
"Unless you were born yesterday, you both knew she wouldn't like this gift and instead of giving her something she'd appreciate, like a gift card, you gave her a gift that made you feel good about yourself.

When we give gifts to people, we make an effort to give them things they'll like, not to get a pat on the back. Also you sound resentful as heck about SIL and her financials, they are honestly none of your business and you need to stop focusing on them."
You had one job. Jesus.. 
"And there's the problem. These people are of the entitled kind, and you know that this demand is coming from who they are rather than tradition. I don't even know who my godparents are and I was raised Catholic, this is a nonsense demand. Treat it as such. 

Don't give in to peer pressure either, these kind of people are usually skilled at manipulating crowd pressure through social media to get what they want, because it's a natural tool for social bullying and they have lots of practice. "
"Yup same here, my wife has a bachelor's, works in aerospace engineering, was working on masters but dropped out since she got the job offer, makes 3 times what I do... And she would never say anything like this at all, and always compliments me honestly on how smart I am about something or skilled at this or that.

I'm mr. college dropout with a GED over here, and she could so easily just say something and shatter me completely. But of course she doesn't because she's my partner.

OP's boyfriend isn't her partner at all."
She's going to keep mooching off you as long as you put up with it. That's her character. She is lazy and full of excuses and comfortable not contributing. I want to just scream GET OUT at you. Get out of this relationship! Leave her and all her pets and her credit card debt and see what she does. 
"Did you discuss your boyfriend staying with you for a week or so with your roommate and make sure she was OK with it? It doesn't sound like it. If you didn't, that was a really inconsiderate, rude, inappropriate thing to do. It's her house too, she pays her share, and she gets a say in what's going on in her own home. This isn't your boyfriend staying over and hanging with you on a Friday night. You moved in a third person to your apartment who is using electricity that she also pays for, using water and gas that she also pays for, who is there hanging around when you are not home, who is in her space without her permission, and who isn't paying for it to top it off.

It's generally considered rude and inappropriate for a roommate to have a guest hang out at their house when they're not home. It tends to make the other household members feel awkward and uncomfortable. Personally, I'd be upset in her place that this person was in my home for an extended time without my consent, that I couldn't relax in my own home, that I was expected to pick up the extra expense of this other person, and that I was trapped in my own home alone with this person who I would feel I either had to hide in my room for some privacy from, or entertain if I was in common areas. 

She tried to tell you that she was uncomfortable with you moving in your boyfriend for a week into a home that is just as much hers as yours. She is absolutely right when she says hat the fact that your boyfriend doesn't have anywhere else to go is not her problem. It isn't, but she's being forced to give up her comfort in her own home for it anyway. He can stay with a friend that has their own apartment without roommates. He can stay in a hotel. He could rent a room short term off of Craigslist. He could stay at a youth hostel if he's broke and has no one else to host him until he finds a place. But really, he didn't think to start looking for a place to live before he lost his previous housing? It's not like he didn't know it was coming. His poor planning is absolutely not your roommate's job to fix for him.

Maybe she could have handled it better, but when it comes down to it, it's her home, not his, and she tried to tell you that she wasn't OK with this arrangement. You shouldn't have brought him there without discussing it and getting her OK with it first, and you should have made other arrangements the second she told you she wasn't OK with him being there. This one is on you. Your boyfriend is a grownup, he can figure out a place to stay that doesn't intrude on someone else's home while he finds an apartment. 

Edit: He's 23 and graduated with a masters degree and is literally in a tent in the woods because his girlfriend's roommate isn't cool with a man she barely knows in her home all the time? Does he not have any friends or family? Does he not have any money whatsoever to rent a room for a week or two, stay in a motel, go to a hostel, whatever? If not, then how the hell is he moving into his own place in a week or two? I just moved, and it cost me first and last month's rent plus a month's rent deposit to move in, plus a $30-50 application fee everywhere I applied, plus a $250-$500 holding fee most places I applied, plus proof of renters insurance to sign the lease, plus utility deposits, etc. If he doesn't have a couple hundred to spend at a motel or short term room for rent, how the hell is he going to afford moving into a new place? And why the hell hasn't he been planning for this? It seems like there may be much deeper issues here."
"Well, she's here to discuss his recent off behavior. The behavior that makes her question his character.

Of course he isn't going to sound so great to a bunch of strangers. But they're together for a reason, obviously. "
Exactly. I always picture someone leaking the comments he posts and posting them on the bulletin at his Drs Office. 
"Probably. People are nice when it comes to temporary lapses of judgement. 

That gloating was no temporary lapse. "
"If this isn't a joke post, there's probably something serious going on in her life.

Changing religious believes is not usually a rapid process and acting so extreme with it doesn't seem very healthy.

Have you asked what prompted her decision? Why she feels this way?
"
Great. After a lifetime of easy living and getting her way.
"I suspected as much, because my boyfriend actually pulled the same shit on me by quitting his job without telling me. No matter how much I loved him, that was the final straw that made it clear to me that he didn't regard our relationship and commitment the same way I did. Instead of wasting my time, I peaced out and decided to put my efforts on finding someone else who would respect my presence in his life. 

...said boyfriend showed up on my doorstep crying his eyes out two months later because he realized life was much worse without me. 

Sadly, you can't help people to get to that moment, the onus is on them. The best thing you can do for yourself is move on when you feel your presence in their life isn't respected or valued, and if they realize they want you in their life, they'll work for it. If not, then you saved yourself time and misery. "
"Not only that, but are you gonna live like this forever, OP? 50/50 of your assets now will be less than 50/50 of your assets in the future (hopefully, anyway).

If you do not see this improving in the future, why waste anymore time/money?

Grow a backbone. See an attorney. Discuss nothing with her; this is why you pay for an attorney. "
"Plus, he recognized that it might not be cool for him to go, so he asked her if she would be comfortable with that and told her that he'd be fine skipping it if she wasn't before she even answered. That makes it sound like (a) he didn't really want to go but was only considering it because his friends would be there and (b) he values respecting OP's feelings and boundaries. She didn't even have a fight with him over this."
"Not being able to hold a job is a pretty big red flag for me.  I don't really care what the job is that they are doing, but I won't be with somebody who isn't reliable and able to put forth enough effort to do decent in a work environment.  It's not the money that's important, it's that I expect this person to be my partner and equal when we take on more responsibilities together.  I totally get not knowing where your going in life (i've been pretty rudderless over the past few years), but you at least need to have enough sense to support yourself and make due with whatever job/situation your currently in."
"&gt;  I just know my decision won't come without consequence for our relationship somehow. 

Clearly, your boyfriend has basically said as much. Unforunately that's life, there are often times when we are choosing between two difficult choices. We want it to be ""right"" vs ""wrong,"" or ""easy choice"" vs ""hard choice."" Sometimes you can't make everyone happy, and sometimes no matter which choice you go with there will be emotional repercussions.

Honestly though? If you break up with him and go on this trip... I doubt you'll come back dwelling about the breakup. I know there is more to every relationship than we hear in these threads, but it's not as though you speak of your boyfriend as if he's your one and only. 
"
"Just god damn semantics. 

I mean you're both grown up adults so maybe sit her down and talk to her about what she means, specifically?"
"Yeah, I just wanted to raise the possibility because I think OP was kind of dismissing it because he was thinking of it as an empty legal threat. She may have phrased it as a legal threat, but even that is a really fucked up thing to say to expectant parents. And when she realizes she can't take their child by law, she may feel justified in doing it by force. Obviously this is conjecture on my part, not every situation turns into a Lifetime movie, but this lady sounds next-level messed up, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I could throw her."
"Yeah, what was he supposed to say about how he knew her, if he didn't say they were dating? ""Oh yeah her, I totally know her in a professional capacity! I worked with her at x company in y position, where she showed great skill in z project!"""
"Also OP, the problem with buying people out when its time for someone to move out, is that those individual items devalue over time.  Do you really want to pay someone the cost of what they paid now despite it only being worth 50% of that 12-24 months from now.  It might be worthwhile also agreeing a schedule of costs now and at the time of moving out they get the lesser of either the market value or what's in the schedule.  A lot easier for everyone to buy individual stuff but seems like you've agreed to do it this more complicated way!"
We've discussed marriage but I don't think he has any idea I'm planning to propose 
"You're still watching though (and so is everyone else), and that's what makes many guys feel like they're creepers for being with their own kids. It's a serious and very annoying issue. "
"She kinda invites herself. Just as she leaves says ok, I will see y'all on Tuesday. To save her ex having to do it I think Ghosting it the way to go. :-) Thanks."

"&gt; sn't that why people post here? To try to get to the bottom of a problem because it's hard to see everything when you're in the middle of it?

No you're right, sorry if I came off hostile.

It's just that he was/is literally calling random women sluts apparently. That seems to me to be the bigger red flag. But I get that those things could suddenly click over something as minor as wearing clothes in the house. "
I was at a friend's restraining order hearing. That's really not true. 
"Whenever she talks about you doing things for her, ignore her.  Once you get there, do exactly the amount of helping you feel is appropriate. You control what you do.

That said, I think you need to start working on a backup plan. What if you arrive and discover that your mother really is in over her head?  "
"If you have had zero sex in six years why do you want to be in this relationship? Sorry to be blunt, but it sounds like he's just not that into you and you would be better off with someone who is."
"With an income that allows you to contribute $2k or $500 a month to him, you could have way more than a few months or even a year of income saved by now.  If you had saved and invested, you could have a pretty good nest egg. There's still time though."
"fo' real. my husband had 'back of the house' duty when the baby was little and I had 'front of the house' feeding since i had the tits. It was never,ever a thing with him to be weirded out by. One of my favorite pictures of him and her when she was a newborn is an over the shoulder shot from her view where he's trying to clean up the tarry first poops and is looking at her like he just found an unexplainable shattered pistol or busted hydraulics, a very studious, determined engineer look and a handful of wipies. He looks like he should be wearing safety glasses and a hard hat for this job, its hilarious 

Most guys who won't change diapers just don't wanna change diapers. You can't really say 'i don't want to change her diaper because I'm afraid of people thinking I'm a pedophile' because a) thats insane and every sane adult knows that b)somebody's got to do it ,especially in the beginning when your stomach ,core, and arms are so very sore from pushing that you can't sit up by yourself c) you and the missus are the only ones in the house so who is going to think you are a pedo? the dog? "
"That's bullshit. If you leaving were that dire of a situation, he wouldn't be emotionally cheating on you.

This is abuse. Manipulation and emotional abuse. Recognize it for what it is. He's not actually worried about you leaving. He's trying to manipulate you.

If he *ever* threatens suicide, you call the police and step away. That's it."
"First off, ""Treat others the way you want to be treated"" should be extended to the woman, too. Her no should be respected, not just her assertion that another man has some sort of claim to her. This often isn't the case, as the women in this thread are saying they have real life experience with dudes persisting in trying to win them over until they mention they have a husband.

Secondly, they specifically used the term ""creep"" to describe the kind of people they're talking about. Not ""the best guys."" 

I know you want to have your feelings hurt over this, but you're just digging for reasons to invalidate what the people here are saying, which you aren't going to do successfully since it's a very real phenomenon."

"You are not being rude, you are looking out for your niece. Trust your instincts. 

But if you're known a the family bitch, that might be because your family is one which prefers to hide/ignore abuse in the family. and they might get shitty with you. "
"100% agree. My husband cheated on me, and I ultimately decided to stay and we worked hard to repair things. Several months after he went no contact with her, and we had begun the process of reconciliation, she called his at his work. He answered (because he didn't know it was her). But then immediately after he called ME at work, sounding very shaken and upset, and told me all about it, answered every question I had, and apologized profusely that this happened.

His immediate and full transparency only increased my trust in him and our chances of working it out. Had he not told me, maybe I never would have found out. But if for some reason I did it would have obliterated any shred of trust/hope I had in him. Even if he told me some time later, it would have been damaging. 

She may hurt over this too (I know I did), but you have a great opportunity to prove your remorse and commitment to making things right."
"I could hear Stitch's voice in my head when reading your comment, and with that a tsunami of nostalgia and ""dem feels"".

But yes, this is an excellent way to describe family, in addition to ""_your real family is the family you **choose**_""."
"Listen, dude, if I were her, and I found out you had kept something like that a secret from me, I would be livid.

 She has a right to know that her father is actively trying to undermine her life. She has a right to know that her father and friends don't view her as a whole, complete adult, and are saying shit behind her back. You have a responsibility to tell her."

That is a way different story! Oh my goodness I would be livid in her position!

"I've always felt like my ""Why"" questions sucked, so I'm really excited to see another approach. Your advice is honestly one of the best birthday gifts I could receive. I really do want to fix my communication problems and make it easier for my partner to talk through issues with me, instead of me talking at him. I really appreciate your help with this situation. I needed an outside perspective, and this has been so useful."

AUGH - as someone who's constantly yelling about sex-positivity and how terrible slut-shaming is ... this isn't slut-shaming. It's asking her to be considerate of where is appropriate to wear star pasties. Going to a club or a party where that type of attire is acceptable is *waaaaaaaay* different than wearing it to dinner with your parents.

"In your last thread, you failed to explain why you were so upset with her. It seems like you want her to apologize for not keeping you updated with a minute-by-minute walk-through of her evening. She told you she was out and told you where she was that night and you seem upset that she didn't text you what you deemed to be ""enough"".

You've now admitted you didn't handle yourself the right away or speak to her the right way in this second fight. Your girlfriend is right to say that there's nothing to talk about and I'm sure she's also thinking how frustrating it is to talk to someone who is so stubborn and won't listen to her point of view..."
"I feel like you have buried the most important part of your post.  David never comes to any of the things you want him to?  I think this invite, that is something he wants and you don't, is starting to make you realize that its BS that he doesn't go to kids parties or socialize with the kids' friends.  I think two separate conversations are key here.  

1. I don't want to go to this party.  The baby is 2 months old and wrangling the 2 year old and the newborn sounds like a shit time.  and 

2. When you don't come to the kids' parties, it makes me feel like I don't have a partner in parenting or in these social settings (or whatever you feel).

The first one is short and he should get a chance to share his feelings too. The second one might be a longer talk..."
"She should have apologized to him when she saw him later but I understand she'd panick when he gave her the lipstick. She is a teen girl, in front of other people and she wouldn't want to risk to bullying or slutshaming. I'm not saying he should become her FWB but I can understand her first instinct was trying to keep her sex life a secret."
"&gt; You make it seem as though I intentionally forgot about him

No, you're projecting that. I never insinuated that by any stretch of the (rational) imagination. 

Intent has 0 to do with it, and your outright denial of that is the stem of this confusion (""I was genuinely confused"").

&gt;I will not know what is up with him 

Because you refuse to believe us. You told him you forgot about him, I've literally ended a relationship on the tail end of a girl saying something similar. It's disrespectful to the n^th degree and the fact that you want to ignore that and minimize it is appalling. 

You basically said, ""You're not important, I don't care about you"" and now you're 'confused' why he's being a cry-baby and cant get over it. 

Maybe stop thinking about yourself and look at it from his point of view.  Stop thinking we're out to shame you or get you, and just listen to what we're saying. 
"
I will. 
"I think if they were actually having an affair that's what your sister would've thrown in your face. I think what's happening is exactly the thing she *did* throw in your face, which is that he's told her that he jerks off to her pictures. In this case, the jerkoff experience is going to be enhanced because he knows the pictures were taken while she was sitting on him and enjoying herself.

This is still really bad, obviously, and a betrayal that you need to work through. But I see married people engage in this weird game of sexual brinksmanship all the time. I see it much much more often than I see actual affairs. They're in a position where they can't sleep with whomever they want to, but they need reassurance that they *could* still fuck a hot person.

You said your sister derives a lot of her self-esteem from her appearance. So she enjoys knowing that your husband finds her attractive. The relationship is mutually beneficial because your husband thinks that if he propositioned your sister, she'd say yes, so he gets an ego boost from that. She probably wouldn't take things that far unless she has a history of that kind of destructive sabotage, but she likes feeling that she wields that kind of power over him, and by extension, you."
"I missed the first post. Is the sister sending him nudes or something? Also, who thinks it's okay to jerk off to their wife's sister? This is a huge clusterfuck."
"Seriously, it's unhealthy to be lying about this so early in the relationship... Lying usually causes guilt and consternation, I don't know how OP does it."
"I said nothing of the sort. I stated in my post that ""I know she only spoke to me out of concern."" 

That said, I think the fact that I probably now have to get my own therapist involved in this mess to clear my name and get them to believe my explanation is an invasion of privacy and shouldn't have to be done. "
"Yeah. I mean, most young people don't have ""guest rooms"" because they're not quite at that point in their life. At 23/25, OP and her friend are probably renters and probably rent exactly the amount of space they need to live.

I'll be 26 next month and I still share a bed with my best friend when I visit her because she still lives with her parents and there is no spare bedroom."
What a fucking drama queen. 
"He understands, he just doesn't care. He is with you because girls his own age would tell him to fuck off"

Please stop."" If he doesnt stop at that point, hes not going to without intervention so contact HR. What hes doing is invasive, unprofessional, and inappropriate. It creates an uncomfortable work environment for everyone and demonstrates a weird, unhealthy fixation with you. Do you guys speak regularly in a friendly manner? If not, its a little weird how concerned he is with you. "
"Does she have any idea of the way you feel? I would be completely honest with her. There's no reason that you need to put on a disingenuous anniversary. She wont look back and appreciate it, and she may actually resent it and start to look at other times where you may not have meant your affection. Talk to her about what you're feeling, and I'm sure that some of the affection that you still feel for her will show through. Maybe you could let her know how things are, but talk about putting that aside for a bit and just celebrating the good times for the day."

"The best hustle is the one you don't see. At the same time, you never know unless you try. So if I were you, I would go back when she's working see how it feels and if your still interested. If you are, then give her your number and tell her you'd like to see her outside of work and if she's interested she can give you a call and then leave. If she's interested she'll call and it avoids any awkward fake numbers or her having to shoot you down.

"&gt; since we roast each other a lot I thought it was just poorly thought out teasing

IME, overly frequent ""roasting"" between friends often stems from some un-addressed underlying source of tension between them. It's almost kind of an excuse to shit on your friend without actually being called out as being rude. Obviously that's not always true, but I find that in cases where the majority of interactions involve ""roasting,"" one or both of the parties actually holds some sort of underlying resentment or jealousy.

It doesn't take a philosophy course and fourty years of life experience to know having an affair is wrong. What is up with this sub, honestly. "
Don't be silly. They clearly play Scrabble.
Sounds like you handled it perfectly. Good job.
"the stupidest thing you could possibly do would be to act on those feelings. There's a very low likelihood it'll work, and if it does there's no chance of this ending well."
"The fetish is called ""bladder control"" or ""Omorashi"" which means to wet oneself in Japanese. I honestly don't know if he's trying to imply this is your kink or saying it's his. By-the-by, if you go too much when you don't really have to go your bladder will shrink. His communication skills are horrible. it makes kink pretty impossible to explore because communication is so necessary."
I think it's more like he wasn't interested in sex unless there was some opportunity for him to shame her for having to piss
"Do you know for certain they are in a monogamous relationship? Just like you and your boyfriend have an arrangement, it might be possible that they do as well (admittedly a very slim possibility).

Talk to your friend. Ask him why he thought it was okay to sleep with you while in a relationship. Tell him that he needs to tell his girlfriend what happened and deal with the consequences of that. 

And maybe ask your next third if they have a monogamous partner before a night of fucking and bdsm. "
Yeah she'll be over with us drama llamas in r/justnomil
"&gt; He was crying, apparently having an emotional crisis, not sure if I even wanted to be in the relationship. So I pulled a third all-nighter reassuring him.

Holy shit. If you told me this was about a 14 year-old boy in his first relationship, I might understand. A 31 year-old man after a month of dating?? He needs some serious help. 

&gt; 6 hours of texting a day is normal.

No, it is absolutely not normal. Nor is it healthy. It's fine to want to check in with each other every day, but you do not need to be in constant contact. 

You've only been dating for a month and a half -- get out now. This guy has *serious* issues with boundaries, and probably leans towards co-dependency. I am totally weirded out by his attitude. This guy would terrify me.

You are not being selfish at all. ""Needy"" is an understatement. 

I would run fast and run far. "
"Is your wife working, or is she at home with the kids? If she's at home, it's easy to get into a trap where you know the quickest and most efficient way of doing something and it can be hard to not think that the different way the other parent does things is wrong. 

However just ignoring a screaming child would have me mad at my partner too. She may have wanted her mum, but that doesn't mean that your comfort wouldn't have helped at all. "
"&gt;I wake up many mornings early for sex or to give him BJs. I make him breakfast and coffee before work. I pay our mortgage and he pays very few bills.

...So what exactly does he bring to the table in the relationship?  Emotionally, he seems toxic and financially he doesn't seem to be pulling his own weight.  I know it might be a challenge to find someone willing to enter into a relationship with 2 kids involved, but this guy is a scumbag and you're better off without him in the long term."
Get outta here OP's sister. 
"I wouldn't trust you again, you used your depression as an excuse to chat up an old fling. So what happens if you hit another rough patch and fall into the old pattern? She is probably wrestling with trying to figure out if she can trust you fully."
"Don't, don't, don't loan her the money.  There are some enormous red flags here:  Despite making quite a bit more money than you, your GF has absolutely no savings nor any credit, not even enough social credit to borrow money from her parents.  In other words, she owes more money, already, than she can afford to repay and/or has a history of failing to repay debt.  There is no way you should risk your savings by lending it to her.

Additionally, her comments about your lack of car ownership indicate that she doesn't respect you, as does her refusal to even consider financing the repair while insisting you should lend her the money you must have (at no interest rate) because ""you are so cheap"".

Tell her ""No"".  If she breaks up with you, you may be better off without her.

Also... Don't move in with her.  Someone who expects you to lend her $3000 is going to think nothing of being short for rent or utilities."
"""No"" is a complete sentence. 

So is ""Stick it up your ass.""

And ""Are you fucking kidding me?"""
"Being in a relationship with someone is a two way street.  You can't have an uncompromising relationship where one side is continuously being level headed and the other is continuously being bull headed.  You come across as a mature well thought out individual who is willing to discuss her issues.  He comes across as someone who deflects blame and immediately turns every concern you have into your fault.

He knows you are unequivocally bothered by an over aggressive woman and yet still arranged a meeting with her... that's a red flag.   He is very defensive about you not trusting him.... red flag...  I'd be on my guard and if I found too many more would be formulating my exit plan."
I think he found it hot for you to be ashamed and embarrassed about having to pee. Humiliation kink.
"Similar thing happened to me. Couldn't understand how she could tell her mom these things. She's said same thing ""I tell my mom everything"".

10 years later, we are married with 2 kids and now that I know her mom so well I get it. They have no out of bounds. It took some getting used to but their relationship is so close because of it. They are basically best girl friends. 

It's not s big deal. It is much better than the opposite where mother/daughter don't speak."
"I wish I could say I'm shocked about how many people are defending him/downvoting me, but it seems like people are so intent on defending guys like this that they give them crazy amounts of slack to keep pushing themselves on their targets.  Even my fucking therapist told me that ""oh maybe he's just trying to start a conversation with you!"" when I told her about the above.  It's baffling.

The cornerstone is OP SAID SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT.  The fact we're getting a pile of ""oh maybe he likes you"" in here is worrying."
"I seriously have no idea why op is this adamant about this... She requested ass pills, so what? Maybe she can't swallow pills without throwing up, maybe its just uncomfortable for her, maybe someone told her horror stories. Whatever. I get horrible gag reflex when i have migraines and i would consider ass migraine pills even if its not the ""standard"" prescription. Just tell her you don't want to help out with them the next time she asks."
"Wait, hold up. His father, a grown man, sexually assaulted you, a teenager?? Or your ex assaulted you? Either is horrible and your ex gf and the police should be informed about these dangerous people. Have you talked to anyone about this? It's really not ok. "
"Our finances have always been separated, so there's no logistics to go around.


Thing is... I want to know I've done everything in my power to make this work, don't want to have to deal with the ""what if's"" some months from now.


I guess I just wanted some confirmation that I've gone above and beyond what anyone would do and it's time to have a serious priorities-check..."
Does it bring home real money that pays bills and stuff? Then its a real job. 
"Exactly. So if my attorney is going to get involved, I'd rather not attend this *mediation*. My lawyer said the same thing. She straight up told me that she will not sit for these sessions, and if the need therapy, they can request it from court. So I guess, I'm gonna stop going to the sessions now. "
Seriously this is fucking creepy
I wanted to add to this because the scars could also be because of a medical condition. My breast are covered in scars from an auto immune disoder that causes me to break out in ulcers all over my breast. 
"Also chiming in this is not normal -- I'm 30 and a loan of that size between friends is totally unheard of to me. The only ""loans"" between my friends are ""oh I don't have my wallet, will you get this candybar and I'll pay you back tomorrow?""

Your ""friends"" are definitely using you and I would cut them off financially, be polite about it but cut them off, and see which ones remain your friends. I'd say you're going to unpleasantly surprised."
"I'll let you in on a secret, since you had parenting drop down on you out of nowhere -- we all feel like that sometimes.    You don't have to be perfect to be a good parent. It's about compassion both for the kids and yourself.

You recognize your anger is stemming from fear you can lose your job. 

Kids are the ones who get to be selfish. Your job is of course to teach them to manage an process that selfishness with their awareness that other people matter too. 

Being able to accept your fear of losing your job and setting that aside, lets you look at the kids outside of that set of feeling.  WTH is their problem (it's been ramped down from WTF IS WRONG WITH THEM)?  They need attention, feel sad, have no context for what positive attention is, they are scared and want to be reassured, etc.  How to acknowledge those in ways that build healthy emotional responses in them is what parenting is all about.

Your husband really does not deserve you, and I hope you know that.  I think HE knows that and resents you for exposing who he really is.

Edit: clarity and \*cough\* language
"
It still lists the sugar in grams too though so anyone could easily check for sugar. 
Honestly no.  His personality and values have only started changing very recently.
"&gt; you could say that hosting the viewing party has become a bit stressful you're reevaluating.&lt;

This is perfect.  It's also true and contains language that might make her get a clue.  

"
"Of course he's not leaving. You pay the mortgage.  He hardly pays anything. You get up early to give him sex and BJ's and breakfast.  He won't find someone else to put up with his abusive, manipulative, lazy butt. And talking to kids that way? Really.. kids who just lost their mother? Unbelievable.  I bet they feel really welcome when they are being told how they better shape up because they are being **allowed** to live in that house. That is **not** family. It should be their house now right? They shouldnt feel like guests. Wtf man. If my sister ever let that happen to my kids I'd haunt her ass. Those poor kids. "
Don't get used to it. It's not okay. 
I had to read it three times to make sure I had everything straight.  At this point I still don't know who's kids are who's and who has college money.
"&gt; A 18 yo doesn't need a new car

I would understand buying her a used car or something, but a 15000$ car is just crazy!"
Seems like you're desperately looking for reasons to stay with him. There are none. You probably should have left ages ago and made better use of your life.
"I think there are other previous behaviours to consider too - for example, what was on the phone wallpaper before the Rachel pic? Was it another one of his pictures, or was it a pic of OP? 

People really do have platonic, creative relationships that work really well, but the sudden secrecy is not ok. OP, why not arrange drinks all together (since you've met and you're casual friends) and gauge the atmosphere or their reactions from there? "
"Exactly. I'm both a former photographer and dating a photographer. Wall paper needs to change. Find another photo you're happy with, maybe a landscape. "
"Here's another factor to consider, my mother did something quite similar, left my dad when she was 52, I was in college at the time. 

Well, my dad basically fell apart--not because he was all that devastated, he was pretty furious--but he just wasn't used to taking care of himself. The house, the animals, cooking, cleaning, everything at home just got very sad and dingy and I worried sick about him. He drank a lot too, scared me to death. I would drive home from school al the time to make sure he was ok, to get him a Christmas tree, cook, tidy, etc. With my mother gone I felt totally responsible for him, and it was pretty difficult. It changed my carefree college life dramatically. 

My mother didn't do anything wrong, btw, I just don't think she ever anticipated the fallout for me. And my dad had a job and a dog he loved and somewhere to go everyday. But it still hit him like a ton of bricks and things got very dark. That's rough on a kid too."
"Three kids. Had to be induced three times for pre-eclampsia. 

Three healthy babies. I felt better an hour after birth than I had in months. And doctors don't mess around with pre-eclampsia, if she's eight months along and hasn't been induced yet that's actually a great sign.  Educate yourself via the doctors, not friends, not even here.  This is a time of a lot of change but you can do this, you can do hard things.

Good luck and congrats!  "
"lol that part made me wanna throw up.
"
"So he had sex with someone else while you were broken up. It must've occurred to you that that was a possibility. 

&gt; The guy is rude to me and he said ""your boyfriend must not have loved you to much because he f***** me while you were broken up.""

I mean, if some rando an SO of mine had a one night stand with when we weren't together contacted me with that, I'd probably tell them they must not have been a very good lay and move on with my life."
I think we can give OP a pass considering how psycho crazy his girlfriend became.
"Being used isn't a ""tie""...

The level of spinelessness it would take for OP to help her sister out with something this shallow is excruciating for me to envision.

I personally cannot feel good about myself when I'm being used."
"CPS and Police for everytime he is trespassing and making threats. As far as confronting the kid, you and your husband got to stop. The kid doesn't care and wont listen to you, you are just wasting your time and you are not his parents, its not your job or responsibility to get his behavior in check. Also, just stop talking to his mother, you said enough to her. She knows what a nightmare she has, the kid is running circles around her, just stop talking to him. The kid will move on to his next target eventually. You are inviting drama every time you confront this kid or his mother. The kid curses you out, don't respond, pretend he is a ghost. "
I'd pick an ex escort who had two clients over an ex junkie who whored around town with little to no limits any day. 
It's almost like a reflex. I even asked him if he had ever been hurt/touched inappropriately (he knows I have) but he insists that its just that he hates his penis. 
"Hey- as someone who has just got out of a lawsuit, I want to say that this is a great idea in theory. But if you can only pay for say...3 months of the hot show lawyer and you need  them for six, that's not great. You may want to go with someone that You can afford for the long haul. "
"There is definitely something wrong with it if it makes her uncomfortable.  He's not ""cooler"" than OP, he's a respectful partner.  Any man who ignores his wife's (or fiancé or girlfriend) request NOT to go to a party alone with strippers and prostitutes, is an asshole.

If your wife was on board with it, that's something else altogether. But don't belittle her because something makes her uncomfortable, for a good reason."
"I am NOT suggesting people who are raw vegans automatically have a mental disorder/illness but in this case your GF very well could have. Has she gotten obsessive about other things, does she already struggle with OCD or anxiety because there is a lot going on here around control and rigidity. She needs to talk to somebody, at least visit her GP for a check up, get some labs drawn make sure she does not have any other health problems. Do not get married yet this could get worse."
"Your girlfriend is suffering from a severe depression. Call some psychiatrists today. See if some of them specialize in depression related to pregnancy. In fact, you may want to call her OB/GYN and ask for an IMMEDIATE referral. Assuming you are US, it is hard to get a psych appointment quickly. You need to emphasize to anyone that will listen this is a dire situation. I normally wouldn't use my personal experience - but when I needed to see a psychiatrist, I was forced to go the ER and say I was suicidal. It was the only way I could see a psychiatrist immediately. It was a shitty, shitty experience but it was necessary. If that's what you need to do, do it.   Most insurances have a ""find a physician"". Stop redditing and start calling. Now."
You and everyone else are right and I definitely needed the kick in the pants. I called him and apologized 
"To address your edit: she is *very* jealous. There are naturally self confident people, who don't put others down, and then there are people who brag about it and show it off.

I had a friend who would do this all the time, proclaim she was smoking hot and better looking than everyone. Then one night she got plastered and confessed that the reason she did it was because she was insecure and bullied as a child, and it's the way she copes."
"I feel like I wouldn't lead with this because what if she wasn't hurt and it was stretch marks or something else, and she felt further humiliated with ""they look so bad he thinks it was painful?""  I'd go the route of just saying that seeing her so upset and crying, and not meaning to violate her privacy like that, made him cry.  And 100% tell her how beautiful she is."
"&gt;  It messes with you mentally and emotionally as well as physically. You feel like your body has betrayed you. You feel angry, bitter, resentful of healthy people, guilty for being boring or a burden or for feeling resentful of people who've done nothing but be healthy.

Dammit.  Thank you for saying that.  I'm going through it now (beginning signs of rheumatoid arthritis, made worse over the past 3 years by an injury that I didn't immediately seek treatment for).  I actually have an appointment with a hand and wrist specialist in about a month about possibly getting surgery done to help some of the problem, but that's honestly just scaring the shit out of me more than anything.

The things I love to do require the use of my hands (knitting, video games, and even reading), and it took me ages to realize that this was a big contributing factor to being sunk back into a bad depression.  The things I love doing the most cause me pain.  It *is* a complete mindfuck."
"Also she's saying that she doesn't really love him, because she knew how much it would hurt him and got with Josh anyway. "
"Who said they hate kids? Do you think your brother hates his niece because he didn't want a preschool at his hawaiian wedding.

"I'm sorry you had to go through that. Your main question seems to be ""how do I move on"". 
 
1.  Surround yourself with your support system. 
2.  Erase everything that will make you remember her. Block her #.
3. Focus on your career and hobbies, and in general living well.
4. Don't hesitate to get a therapist to help you through the grieving process.
5. Be glad that you're young. You'll find a better woman.

"How are you gonna monitor that though? What if you encouraged them to live in communities you could keep track of? You could call them, I dunno, camps of high density?"
"If he's not calm and reasonable, then it's a damn good thing you're having this fight before you give him money to become a partner. "
"Step 1: realize that your GFs family may be shit.
Step 2: reorganize future financial aid so it goes to you GFs account.
Step 3: probably take a step back from contacting the mom for a while. Realistically, she's not getting that money back but she was pretty foolish to leave this in her mom's greedy hands in the first place.

Step 4: contact mom and have GF explain to her (maybe over email?) that she expects to be repaid for the 24,000 or whatever the amount is.

Step 5: mother gets angry again, etc.

Really, since your GF seems to be unable to stand up for herself and her mom is a huge asshole, you're probably best off severely limiting contact with her. But that's on you GF. it'll be hard for her but she has to face facts, her family sucks."
"People hate it when other people ""trickle truth"" them. Why would you do it to someone else? If you have one chance to get all the cards on the table, you put your damn cards out there. If the other person find out later that you hid some cards up your sleeve, it undermines the entire trust you're working so hard to rebuild. Always, always lead with the full truth"
"That still doesn't explain why you went in and read his conversation..?

Edit: deleting your rationalization doesn't answer the question.."
"I like this way of addressing it: it could be a really eye-opening experience to suddenly consider the idea of a woman with interests and hobbies in common with him; that fits his lifestyle; and is someone he can talk to and hang out with etc.


Unfortunately it could well be that he simply pictures screwing a faceless woman call day; being brought breakfast in bed; and receiving massages before relaxing in the jacuzzi."
I'm guessing he was already cheating on his girlfriend or has cheated in the past if she was so ready to dump him. Especially since he was so bold as to ask you over and make a move while his girlfriend was inside the house. I'd tell him to fuck off.
"Does it matter if he's using her or not?  I doubt she wants to marry a guy who is cheating on her.  If she did, she wouldn't be here.  The fact that it's with an escort is beside the point."
"You may have had the child, but you don't own them or their identity no matter that they share your DNA. Once they've hit a certain age it's disrespectful to disregard a harmless request. "
If that's what it takes then yes. Your father's sister is a bully. You do not allow yourself to be bullied. Tell the children that they are always welcome to contact you whenever they can. 
"I should clarify, they are not paying for the wedding fully, they have pitched in an amount equivalent to 20%. Not to minimize, but just for transparency. I appreciate your input!"
"In fact, one of the reasons Elizabeth Bennet is so shocked by Mr. Darcy's first proposal is because he was not courting her, this was not expected, she could not do him the courtesy of rejecting his courting in advance - accordingly she has to be cold and clear in her rejection because she could not do so more nicely or subtly earlier.

"Does this guy care at all about anything that's important to you?

You're a grown up, you can buy a dress if you love it, or for any reason at all. You can wear it to the supermarket at broad noon topped off with a purple hat and a feather boa and belt out Gypsy in the dairy aisle. And I think you should.

You have agency here, and free will, and you are a self-contained human being with desires that are no less important than his. Like a desire to not come face to face with an old wedding pic eleventy seven times a day. But I get this sense you're a victim of logic-whiplash here, where you get, for want of a better term, ridiculed out of perfectly reasonable ideas and made to feel silly and small for having them in the first place. 

It's very defeating, and it's no way to live either.

But what if you put a photo of you and the other actor in the sex scene as your phone wallpaper and started hiding your phone while giggling at texts this actor sends you at all hours? The phone wallpaper is like the cherry on top of this mess.
"I don't mean this in a disparaging way, but do you normally have a difficult time grasping how to navigate these types of social situations? Or do you maybe just come from a culture where it's acceptable to make unprompted comments about appearance or other individual characteristics? It seems like a lot of people have already tried to explain this to you and it's not making sense to you. 

But basically, in the western world normally adults don't just go around telling each other ""You sure are average at your job"" or ""You're a perfectly plain looking person"" or ""Your clothes are totally nondescript"" or ""Intellectually, I give you a C."" It's making a subjective assessment that wasn't asked for, and in most societies it's just not something that's socially acceptable. The person doing it comes off totally socially inept. It's not a direct insult, but it's  something you don't want to think about when you're just trying to go about your day or have a good time. Most people don't think about the fact that others are judging them constantly, and to have a friend tell you ""I have judged you as X"" can be a little jarring.

There's nothing wrong with being average, most of us are by definition. We are talking about how socially inept it is to go around voicing unprompted value judgments about people."
"Then actually use your fucking words. If and didn't know she was jabbing you, you just hit her out of nowhere with no explanation."
A person should not convert to a religion solely based on another person. If you were interested in the religion regardless of her than that would be different but that doesn't seem to be the case.The mormon religion is very involved and is not just converting it touches every facet of your life. It is basically a lifestyle change not just church on Sundays. If I were you I would look into it more but personally I wouldn't do it.
"

&gt;Plus I'm afraid to leave the house sometimes because my dad might pull some crap while I'm gone, and now I feel bad about leaving my mother behind because she's isolated too.

&gt;

Do you mean that your afraid your dad will hurt your mom if you leave?

It sounds like you are in a really bad situation. You said you and your mom have thought about leaving, why haven't you?  Have you contacted a shelter in your area to discuss options? "
"Reddit is really, really unforgiving of cheating no matter what the circumstances, (sometimes, it seems, to the point of refusing to read anything *about* the circumstances) but Captain Awkward (I think?)  has a good line about how it's not good, but in some relationships it's a ""gnaw off your own paw to get out of a trap"" sort of thing.  I think that might be what's happening here.

If you want to make a relationship you *can't* keep punishing someone, you can't -over the course of years! -- keep telling them they're a horrible person and screaming at them for hours. That's abuse. And it's still abuse even if the person did something wrong. No one deserves to live their life like that indefinitely.

Yes, you should get a divorce. Yes, despite what you did, you do deserve to find happiness."
"""The thing to get into your head is he does not care.""
Yes, I guess that is true. I wanted to think he did... but when you say it that way, you're right. He really doesn't care about anyone but himself it seems."
"I'm curious as to how old your husband/his father is. If you're closer in age to your stepson than you are to your husband, it's no wonder he doesn't respect you. You're more a peer than an authority. 

And on top of that, you're not his parent, you're his step parent. And as such, you absolutely have no right or responsibility to parent him. He already has two parents and that's their joint responsibility, not yours. 

Give the kid some space and try taking on a less motherly role. Let him define the relationship in a way that makes him comfortable."
"I have two kids and have never posted a picture of one of them on social media, and never will.  I don't even use my real name on Facebook.  I like privacy, and anyone who I would want to have pictures of my kids will receive them individually, through other channels."

"Personally I would be more concerned about the the paranoia, the manipulative and immature ""silent treatment"", the needless aggression and sudden escalation to shouting, the inappropriate controlling sadistic tendency - ""made me change my profile picture on social media to my dog because he was too disgusted"" WTF - and the grudge-holding /inability to genuinely resolve an argument.

In its narrow sense, ""gaslighting"" proper is usually deliberate (and less common than some in this sub believe). It's hard to tell whether he is doing this on purpose or genuinely has a poor memory with a lot of distortions caused by his emotional problems, but either way he's not currently behaving in a way that's conducive to a happy, healthy relationship."
"Baby is on the register now, so it isn't just water... now there's a paper trail and this kid is, in the church's eyes, Catholic.

"I don't see how this relationship can go closed and you still be as happy as you have been. You enjoy your freedom to hang out with your friends and go to the gym. Now that Kelly is getting jealous, she is trying to take away your freedom. Kelly is now showing her true colors. "
"Tell him that you like where you live now, and were expecting to stay there. 

Talk to him about the various options.  If he doesn't see any other options, don't marry him.  If you are unwilling to consider moving in with his family, don't marry him.  

Really, I'm pretty sure this is going to come down to ""Don't marry him"" regardless of the discussions. It's too bad you didn't discuss any of this sort of thing before getting engaged, but it sounds like you want incompatible futures. He, apparently, has always planned to go live with his parents and work for them, and somehow never thought to mention it. So he needs someone who is up for that life, which isn't you (and likely isn't any woman).  

Ruining your relationship isn't the biggest fear here. Ruining your life is.  If you need to end the relationship to not ruin your life, that's a better outcome.

Do not agree to this. You are right about the relationship with his mother and its likely effect on you.  Let alone what this means about how much regard he has for you and your opinions.  

You're 22. You have plenty of time to chalk this one up to a learning experience and find someone else more compatible to spend your life with.

"She's a grown adult that knowingly leaves faeces on the toilet seat at her workplace. This is an actual biohazard in their workplace and you're more worried about being sensitive?

OP, there is a host of risks involved with having contact with human waste, especially if she's leaving ""skid marks"" from old waste. This needs to be escalated ASAP."
"Yeah, I do want to basically say to him, ""I'm not your kid or your employee, so I don't have to be lectured by you.""  I don't know if I could cut contact (it would basically mean not seeing my dad or my sister) but I could lay down that I'm not engaging with him anymore when he does this.

The weird part being that our actual dad is not like this at all."

I would guess she either has a crush on you, is dealing with the idea that she might like girls, or just wants attention. 

None of those things are your problem. She is molesting you, and you need to firmly tell her no. "
"She has a long distance relationship with the new man and as far as I'm aware it's an open relationship. I have never met him and don't know what he would think of it. I wouldn't move in with my ex and his new partner. He tells me my boundaries around this are selfish and unhealthy (""I'm worried you'll have the upper hand and get everything you want and I'll get nothing"" and ""maybe you should get counselling around this issue"") which I'm told is a tactic that narcissists use to try to beat down healthy boundaries to get their way."
"Your perspective needs to change.  Your boyfriend isn’t a good guy.  Maybe you could have done something to stop him, but he doesn’t care about you.  Sure, people can have open relationships or try new things sexually, but good people are clear, considerate and cautious."
He's masturbating to my clients. It's called respect and privacy.
There is. But every time I went to one of those meetings it was so freaking bleak. And every single person was divorced or separated. It was like seeing a sad future. I don't know. I just honestly thinks he has no respect for me as a person and wife.
"I think it's pretty clear that his intentions are bad and that he's willing to mistreat you.  Doesn't sound like a friend to me.  Sounds like a manipulative jerk.  Why would you try to be friends with someone like this?  I get it, you invested time in him, but why keep going along with it?

Btw, I get that you're probably great and all, but what reasons do you think a 50+ year old guy would be online cultivating female friends half his age for?"
"I highly doubt that's the case because in order to work at a bank, you have to have decent credit. They don't really trust people with poor credit to help others with opening bank accounts and making smart financial decisions. "
"That quite the assumption you made.

They each have their own apartments, and presumably jobs at different locations, so it sounds like she's not necessarily with him when he's spending his money frivolously. 

She refers to the time they spend together as date nights. That tells me they don't live in each other's pockets. He's likely not buying the take out and beer home for *them*, but for him.

He needs to learn how to live within his means instead of relying on others to subsidize his fun times. "

I was 11 at the time... I have called CPS once before when my mom hit me but she didn't leave a mark so they didn't believe me."

"Tell your husband that if four teenagers are going to be home from school for two weeks on his say-so, then he is the one who:

* gets to stay home with them - Jude is not out running around, he is immobilized, so they don't get to treat this like extra vacation.  It's home schooling time, and he's in charge of it. I'm sure his workplace will have no problem with him bailing for two weeks unannounced.   

* Which means he gets to coordinate collecting their school-work and materials and making sure it gets done in a timely manner and returned to the school every morning.  

* As he's home and you're going to be taking care of Jude, he is in charge of all domestic issues.  This doesn't mean he necessarily has to do it all, but he does have four perfectly able helpers.  They should be more than able to move all the heavy furniture for a good deep post-summer-vacation vacuuming.  

* Presumably, at least one or two of your eldest daughters have driver's licenses.  They are now in charge of running the errands.  On a time-table.  You know exactly how long it takes to pick up and drop off the dry-cleaning, and that's as long as it should take them.  So your husband needs to make sure they aren't abusing the car rights by driving around for two hours when 15 minutes will do.  

Your kids are being kids.  Your husband is the problem - he is not acting like a rational parent."
"OP, I'd find your background much more difficult to accept in a potential partner than hers. 

You had shitty coping mechanisms, suggesting to me poor judgement and immaturity. 

She had a practical issue and found a way of solving it that sounds much safer than what you were doing (two sugar daddies vs sleeping with anyone available and doing drugs). 

I think you should work on yourself before forming a relationship - you sound very insecure. "

"She's in for a surprise.

I've spoken to a lawyer. I forgive her for what she has done, but I simply can't remain in this marriage. At this point, I don't see any winning scenario. One of us has to lose in order for the other to win. I'll be initiating the divorce proceedings."
"First he isolated you, then he got you pregnant as quickly as possible to trap you, (which is reproductive coercion, a form of domestic violence) and then he started financially abusing you. From the way this has progressed it will probably only get worse.

Bloody hell, I wish you weren't so *right* in your well-earned cynicism.

"Because ""when you know, you know 💜💜💜"". (eye roll) 

My dad married a woman, neigh, a succubus, after knowing her for 4 months. Met in February, engaged in February, married in May. 

It was the biggest mistake of his life and 8 years later, he's still up to his ears in her shit. His blushing bride is absolutely insane and has isolated him from his children, siblings and friends. What I keep coming back to is the fact that he took the plunge without ever getting to know her in and out. I just can't reconcile that in my head. Wtf was he thinking? 

OP, don't be like my dad. Don't be a doormat. Don't be naive. Don't bury your head in the sand. Red flags abound. It's still early. Walk away from this fool. "
"If all you needed was a ride, then how did he get involved in the selection process, and why didn't you just firmly say ""I can handle this, and $14K is out of my price range?""

I'm also wondering why you started off by telling us about your SO's salary and spending habits. That's irrelevant to this story, unless ""why won't he help me"" implies that you are wishing he'd contribute financially to the new car, since he makes more? Is that the case? "
"Dude, take a breath. Reread what I wrote. I never said what she did was ok. I stated what popped into my head as a possible scenario, then said it was unlikely, and said that OP should talk to his girlfriend about what she did. I never said anything justified her letting some dude take those photos, or that she was in any way innocent. "
"You're right, my belief is that i would have accepted it if they were up front about it. 

However really when i left her and california i wanted to start again new. It's awkward to have something lingering from my past which I have no control over.
But if they're truly happy together i wish them well, just wished it was communicated earlier."
"I had my heart set on a baby name since I was a baby myself. I got pregnant, told my husband the name, and he laughed in my face. He hated it so much! So we picked a ton of names until we found one we BOTH liked. Both parents should have veto power."
"Do not feel bad for saying no about Adam. This is your trip too and you don't want him there. Period. No. Too bad. Your brother knows how you feel about him, you've made it clear. And it frankly sounds like your brother just doesn't care one bit about your feelings.

If your brother was bringing no one and you were also bringing your boyfriend, that might be one thing, but your brother is already bringing along his girlfriend, too (who I'm sure also is so thrilled about bozo tagging along). 

Tell your brother no, just no. And if he pushes it, ask him if he really wants to use this trip to spend time with you because he cares about you. Because if he just wants to hang out with his dick friend, they can plan their own trip. "
She's not your friend.  
"Yeah, where the fuck do these people come from? "
"&gt;&gt;Eventually, after considerable lying and denials, she admitted that she fucked him at our house while I was traveling in June. She said it was a one-time thing.
I still have her phone and I have been texting the dude. I have told it is me. He has admitted that the had sex back in 2010 in their hotel, which she is still denying.

Really sorry to say this, but it's time to go. If she cannot be honest then there's zero hope of rebuilding the marriage that she chose to throw away.

See a lawyer ASAP. Tomorrow if possible. "
Imagine the shitstorm that would happen if OP was actually overweight. 
"This guy doesn't care about her well-being. He's trying to shame her in public and make her feel self-conscious. Those are some of the least effective tactics for encouraging long-term diet changes. Most importantly, OP has asked this *coworker* (also an inappropriate role) to STOP. Coworker ignores OP's boundaries. This is not only wrong, it's harassment and totally unprofessional. Coworker should be subject to disciplinary action."
"It's not incest disgusting because technically your not related. For some possible overlooked perspective, you sound incredibly selfish and ungrateful. This man, a man who adopted you and raised you as his own son. A man who seems to have provided you with an over privileged life, possible feelings about this was only mentioned briefly at the very end of a very long letter and it wasn't really about him really, it was about you being worried about getting caught.

So for something that you seemed to have completely neglected to think about, or at least mention in this letter. How do you think this would make him feel? Personally, I think it would be pretty upsetting and maybe even devastating to him. I think this would probably feel like a real knife in the back from you. Anyway, that's my whole two cents on this."

"It's not that you're handling fights wrong. It's that he's saying abusive, controlling shit. ""Don't talk back to me""? Seriously? He's not the parent of a poorly behaved child.

"She didn't open Pandora's box. He asked her first, as a way of cushioning what he planned on saying."
"Yeah, there are much bigger issues here, but you're right that the compromises should have been ""we each get to pick a few things that are most important to us and do those"". So he could pick brunch and playlist and she could pick dress and photographer.  This way she just ended up losing out on every aspect that was important to her."
"You will never convince someone who believes they are god's gift to the world that maybe they aren't as special as they thought they were. Women aren't pieces of meat, to be served on a silver platter by a butler. His ""high standards"" are wanting a model to be his fuck buddy, essentially. 

The thing here is that his attitude WILL affect your ability to get/keep a girlfriend, because people will think you're an arrogant, misogyntic asshole too. That is not a friend that will have your back. He may or may not learn eventually that he is the problem, when he is single at 40, but until then let him dig his own grave."
"She wanted to the world to know exactly why she was leaving him and to know how shit of a person he was. She sent it to his parents and family members knowing that it would cause this kind of reaction because she wants him to suffer as he has made her suffer.

Sure she could have take the high road but the only person who benefits is the cheater. Why should she say nothing and save his skin. 

She has fought her own battle, she's just using his family as tools against him. She was married to him for years so she knows his weakspots. She didn't ask for them to get angry, she just showed them salient information and let hell break loose.

It doesn't matter whether he ends up with preggo girl or not. What matters is that she got some small sliver of her pride back. She can say ""well he f*cked another girl but I f*cked his life up"". It's not a nice thing to do, it might not be the right thing to do but the whole situation is wrong.

Honestly, I think fair play to her. Woman are so often told to be meek and let shit like this slide. Men (well people generally) like him count on her embarrassment when she has nothing to be embarrassed about. She made a bad choice picking him to marry but at the end of the day it's not her that chose to have her husband screw around. 

She let her anger be known and she scorched the earth all around her. If that's not closure on a shit time, I don't know what is. "

"I know that this is just a guess, but I'd say that she is in love with you and the guy. Her talking about wanting to have sex with him might have been a way for her to slowly introduce that idea to you - to basically have a V-relationship with him, herself and you. Obviously this is not working out.

The only advise I can give is to talk to your girlfriend. Put everything on the table: 

* You feel like the two of them are in a relationship - or at least madly in love.

* You do not want a polyamorous relationship - their behaviour is breaking your heart, it makes you suffer heavily.

* Your agreement was, and ever will be, a one-time sex event. Not an introduction of him into your relationship.

* You feel like your girlfriend is committing more to him than to you and that her behaviour towards him is breaking relationship rules the two of you set up long ago.

If you tell her all those points, her reaction should tell you if this relationship has a future or not."
"You sir, sound like an idiot. Since you are an engineer, I will instead assume you are not an idiot, just that in many arenas (especially social ones) you merely resemble one. I have many engineer friends; this is a common experience. 

You have made several assumptions which are not necessarily true, and that's causing you some distress. To wit:

&gt;she is so smart and should be finishing school first and foremost.

Why? You're using the word 'should', implying that there's some obligation, or duty, that it is self-evident that schooling is both the correct action, and the most pressing. Examine your assumptions. 

Yes, college was great... **for you**. But there are many, many successful adults who did attend or finish college. There are many industries and trades that require training but not schooling, and there are many entrepreneurs who are quite successful without needing school. 

&gt; I have never asked her, but I'm not sure that they haven't slept together.

Do not start making a list of all of the people you cannot be sure your girlfriend has not slept with; you will start giving the side eye to the grocery store check out clerk and the gas station jockey. This line of thinking is utterly and completely unhelpful to you. Is she sleeping with him now? No? Then all is well, and drop the inquiry. 

&gt;Every Time I bring it up that she should be in school getting a real career she gets angry

Good for her! Not only are you making an assumption about the importance of school for her, but you are trying to assume a role of telling *her* what *she* should do with *her* life. 

&gt; But I'm the one who has her best interest in mind. 

Who do you think is, and should be responsible for making choices about her future? Her, or you? 

Who do you think best knows what makes her happy? Who do you imagine is an expert in what they enjoy doing for work, what skills they have, what future they want? Her, or you?

You want good things for her, but who do you think knows her better, her or you? 

Let's take a step back, because that last bit might sting a little. 

Right now, she works the same number of hours or less than you do, earns more than you, and has better job perks. (free car! Cruise for the two of you!) Your position is that she should quit that job, lose all that income, enroll in school, probably take out loans to pay for it, all to work at a job that will likely pay less, with worse benefits, that she might not enjoy as much. Because it's what **you** think she **should** do. 

Can you see how weak a position that is? "

"Sometimes there are gay people who are so deeply closeted they really haven't even acknowledged their sexuality to themselves, and they may marry due to self-deception or intense religious pressure, or due to a belief that they really can choose their sexuality or ""be healed"" or some such.

First thing I would do is have a personal talk with the little girl. Let her know that you love her, that under *no circumstances* will she be hit, and that this is her home.

And then please ditch the asshole. I've never heard of anyone as awful as your husband, and I've had my share of destructive exes."

"I don't blame him for breaking up with you, 0 sex in 6 years is pretty bad, and sexual incompatibility is a pretty common reason for breakups.

Sucks, but try and move on. Don't contact him again."
"You bring up good points. 

My initial request sprang from a discussion at our parenting group. The thought that was by abstaining from alcohol, fathers can be more a part of the pregnancy. I thought that was a really cool idea, especially as the fathers in the group stated that they really wanted to experience as much as the mothers did in a show of support. 

And we compromised based off of that request. He truly seemed engaged and plugged into the compromise. I'm not kidding or mincing words here - he seemed 100% fine with the compromise. Previously he did not go out a lot with his friends, either, so it wasn't like I was expecting him to be gone as often and as long as he is. 

I've tried working with him on this subject and if a bottle of beer brought him home more often, then I would be fine with him drinking around me. But he won't talk with me about that - I've straight up asked him if he would be around more often if I said it was ok to drink around me and he completely deflected. 

So I agree with you - it's worth it to have a few beers in the house to have my husband. But he's completely shut down from communicating with me, which has me worrying on a deeper level, that alcohol isn't his issue at all.

"Dude, most people have expressed what I've thought on the topic. But let me tell you, there is no way in hell any man is going to be able to explain to you accurately how a vagina feels differently from your hand or a fleshlight. The biggest difference that I am able to express is that it is another human being doing the actions, so your own brain doesn't know the movement is coming, reminiscent to as if you try to tickle yourself, and you're not ticklish, but when someone else does it, it's crazy ticklish.

Let me also say, that your attitude is kind of shitty. Please don't go into this thinking, ""I just really need to get laid, I don't care what happens.""

Best advice I can give you is just be yourself, and let things progress naturally. Start slow, with foreplay (Kissing, body rubbing, nibbling) and then let it progress to oral maybe, and don't worry if you come too soon, if you do just let her know to give you a minute to recover and you can start over. While you wait to recover, go back to oral, or kissing her all over her body or something.

Just DON'T jump right to PIV. Women are like diesel engines, you gotta warm them up well before running them for any period of time.

But most importantly, stop worrying about getting laid. The minute you stop worrying altogether, it'll happen organically."

"When someone threatens to kill themselves, you have to treat it as a serious threat. 

By calling 911, it does a couple of things. Firstly, if they are seriously suicidal, it saves their life. The police arrive and assess the situation. They are trained for situations like these and they know what to do. You are not trained, so you can't help. You MUST call the professionals, or you run the risk of making things worse. If the police believe she is in danger, they will get her the help she needs. That is so important. 
 
The other thing it does is important, too. If she is trying to threaten suicide to manipulate you, it lets her know that this tactic will not work. In the future, if she starts to think ""PostAwayTossed won't do what I want, and I'm REALLY mad! If she doesn't do what I want her to, I'll tell her I'm going to kill myself! Then she'll feel terrible and she'll listen!"" she will think twice. ""Wait...what if she calls the cops again? That sucked so bad last time. I had better not..."" 
 
It sets a clear, firm boundary. And right now, what you need are clear boundaries. Because she is stepping alllllll over yours.

I don't know, OP was talking about something romantically sweet, yet non-sexual, that Adam did, and Rachel responded with ""Yeah, I've always wanted to fuck him, but don't have any other feelings for him."" That is a complete non sequitur to what OP was talking about. I think Rachel did that deliberately to hurt OP. Sure, it sounds like OP was bragging a bit about how great Adam was, and if Rachel has purely sexual (or more) feelings for Adam, she can not like to hear that. But, Rachel knows that Adam and OP are in a monogamous/exclusive relationship, and knows that OP isn't as open sexually. Sure, maybe Rachel, and maybe most of the people in this friend group, only have open relationships sexually. But the fact that Rachel hasn't yet been with Adam sexually, despite wanting to fuck him and being in this very sexually open group of friends for a while now, is also evidence that she was trying to deliberately mess with OP."
"Based off of this one incident I don't think she's that crazy. She acted kind of rudely, sure, but OP did give her the lipstick in front of her friends... The implication of intimacy can definitely be seen there, especially when you put on the ""I'm 17 and in high school and not even dating OP but somehow left my lipstick at his place when we 'studied'"" goggles. A man sleeping around is a stud... Not so much a girl, even if she only did sleep with one person. Don't forget this is high school, hormones are raging, how you're viewed socially is a pretty big deal. Women expressing their sexuality like that is kind of frowned upon, and more so if OP and the girl are in the U.S. given the kind of religious/taboo undertones of women having sex with people that aren't their boyfriends. Hell, OP even said she did apologize in private. My money is definitely on her trying to save face in front of her friends after being put on the spot. "

Everyone thinks they have something witty to say about your hair...from crude sexual jokes, to guys hitting on you because they're fixated on bedding a redhead, to women accusing you of dying it, to stylists who try to talk you out of putting any color in your hair at all.  Just let it alllllllll roll off...or come up with snarky comebacks, that's what I do."
"You're not in love. You're in lust with a hot eighteen year old. You're the kind of silly fucker a stripper would have a field day with, she'd leave work with your car keys.

At your age you really should know better. Come on man. Leave her alone. 

And yes. You're a creep. Not for looking, but for everything else. 

Well... Yeah. Kinda, borderline for looking. "
"Yeah no.  You may be trying to play devil's advocate, but it's not working."
People like this....ugh.... With a very slight attitude adjustment they could be having a wonderful co-pregnancy experience. My bff and I had daughters 3 weeks apart and it was so great to have a friend going through it with me.
Yup. Some people get way more attractive and grow into their looks as they get older. Look at Kate Winslet. 
"Just... move past it bro.

She probably thinks you're a dick, because you were a dick. Nothing you do is going to change that.

And seriously dude, be less gross."
"So did you ask her? You said you asked her multiple times. Then you said she was still asleep when you left. Then you said you needed to change gauze and dose pain medicine.


So what exactly happened when you asked? Did you ask? Do you communicate with her the same way you're currently communicating with me?"
"&gt;When I realised it wasn't **I said no and tried to push him away**


Bolded added. Can you not read? Forcing sexual contact on someone who has clearly said no and physically attempted to resist is not a mistake. That's rape. "
"&gt;They've been friends for 15 years, and have been meeting up quite a few times.  He never raped her, or sexually assaulted her any of these times.  That tells me that he's not that type of guy.  **The sex could have been consensual**.  I'm not saying it was, and I'm not saying it wasn't.  

They've been friends for 15 years and it's been completely platonic on her end with him relentlessly trying to pursue a relationship in the last few years. What seriously seems more likely, especially based on the post? 

You're honestly a complete and total idiot. She said she passed out drunk on the couch. She was black out drunk and **completely unable to give consent.** 

She got drunk with someone she trusted. He used that to his advantage to prey on her and sexually assault her. 

Stop victim blaming. In no way, shape or form does it sound like OP had drunk sex and is regretting it and people like you are the reason so many rapes go unreported. Give your head a shake man."
"This dude is a total ""nice guy"". Seems harmless, but isn't."
"&gt;If you need intellectual conversations, find some friends to have them with.  Your wife doesn't need to fulfill every single one of your needs.  It's OK to get some needs met elsewhere.   
  
If I could put this on billboards everywhere I would. There is nothing wrong with having (appropriate!) needs fulfilled by someone other than your partner. Hobby and interest type needs. I love football and my girlfriend could not possibly care less - so I post on football forums online and talk to friends about it. She enjoys playing softball and I can't play due to injury any more - so she's on a league with her friends that I'm not involved in (except for meeting up for the occasional post-game beer!).  
  
Having separate, individual lives is important. Obviously it's *much* harder with two young kids, but even a few hours a week can make a difference. "
"I for one think the people on this subreddit love the word divorce too much, he made a mistake true but its the reason for it that should concern you hes depressed badly and no him saying he wants to die isnt him looking for sympathy for what he did, he may actually feel that way especially if his career is in danger with a baby on the way, what he did was messed up and you both will need to speak to a councilor about it but HE needs therapy before he actually does something to himself,he did something wrong even if you had to ask him about it for him to tell you,he didnt try to turn it around on you or to guilt you he just gave up not on the marriage but on himself the dude needs help, it was a great marrage before and theres no reason that it cant be even better once you 2 get through this"

Wow! I'm still amazed by her attitude.  I'm limited to experiences here in Manchester but walking seems very common here in the UK.  Your response made me laugh. :) 
"He was fine with her going out partying and hooking up with some randos. IE, so long as it was physical, not emotional. He wasn't fine with her having feelings for a friend, and using this as an excuse to cheat. He told her this. Then she lied about it, ""oh no, I've got nobody in mind"" ""definitely not seeing a coworker"" ""okay maybe I'm seeing a coworker"" ""I can't decide between him and you"". This was not what they agreed on."
"You guys don't really sound like your compatible, why try to change each other so much?"

Well MY doctor ripped me from vag to asshole with my first! I'll attend a baby shower from time to time, but sweet baby Jesus, the war stories really turn me kinda green."
Classic case of being able to dish it out but not take it.  You made her feel insecure when you talked about your exes even though she asked for it and shes been blabbing about hers.

"Im aware of cry it out. We sleep trained our 9 month old. I am a vocal supporter of ferber.  

I 100% disagree with CIO for tantrums at 9 months though. You comfort your baby at that age. 

I disagree. He should have went and got the mom and took over mowing. Instead he did NOTHING. Let the mom continue working, to come in tired to have to comfort the baby. God forbid he get off his ass and mow eh?"
"He also views relationships with women (and maybe all?) in regards to what he can get from it. There's no give here, and companionship for companionship's sake does not appear to be on his list of useful relationship benefits.  What a disgusting person. I could never be friends with someone like that. "
"I'm an American and I'd still be uncomfortable receiving a gift of that value.

1) I'll never be able to reciprocate, so it's setting up the relationship in an unequal manner.

2) It feels wrong to spend that much money in a short time when it's more than I make in a year. I have debt, or there are charitable causes, or I could travel the world or take an entire year off of work . . . instead I am spending one night in a hotel room. It just feels weird."
/r/raisedbynarcissists might also help OP with the family side of things.
"As a 35 year old woman with a younger boyfriend:. I find that kind of ""guy talk"" immature and crass.  It wouldn't make me jealous it would just turn me off.  Those women are people with feelings, and though thy won't hear you say those things, I still find it disrespectful to them.  We all find other people attractive, but doing the whole ""fuck i would bang her so hard!"" Is just showboating and immature.

I also am not ok with my SO sharing our private relationship issues in a group chat without my knowledge.  Problems between us should be discussed and solved between us.  If he has another friend or two he wants to chew it over with with my knowledge, that's fine...but general bitching about our relationship problems isn't ok.  I respect him enough not to bitch to girl friends about him, and I expect the same from him.

So yes, I take issue with what you did, but not in the way she took issue.  She's clearly insecure and jealous (which I am not).  If you two can discuss this calmly and try to find a way to set up boundaries around the relationship, and she apologizes for her over reaction, you could work through this."
"Not only would you completely betray your daughter, but you'd sell your own dignity. How much is your morality worth? You're free thought? Your love for your daughter?

On top of that, you'd prove to your mother that you can be controlled on a whim. Anytime you do anything she doesn't like, she can just threaten to take away your inheritance. Why would she stop now?"
"I agree with you...but..at what range would it be worth to just pretend that they broke up? 
I assume that the daughter lives very far away from the rest of the family so who would know?...my grandfather went to his racist grave not knowing that I had gotten married to an amazing woman who happened to be black. 
So my question isat what dollar amount would you sit down with the daughter and say ""hey Grama sent me this letter... sorry about this situation, but I want my million dollars, call your Grama tell her you caught him cheating and broke up with him, we'll see you in April for the wedding. Stay there for a year or two, mom doesn't have long left, after that it's a fait accompli"

I always love when Michelle Williams (the actress not the singer) had short hair.  I thought it suited her really well and she looked completely adorable with it and she was with Heath Ledger for years with that hair.  
We've tried shopping together but it ends poorly. She ends up in a lot of the stores that have clubbing outfits and says she's too young to wear grandma clothes from GAP or Banana republic 
"&gt;""I'm cringing to think he's been seeing what I Google or text""

Has he ever indicated awareness of things that he shouldn't have been aware of? You are bound to have texted things that out of context would have bothered a jealous/insecure personality. Has he ever nonchalantly brought up your relationships with other men, particularly those you've ever texted? Something like, ""So tell me about this guy Michael you work with. What's his story?"""
It is very level-headed to be reacting with anxiety to this situation.
"I'm confused. What did you get pulled back into? Pulled back into coaching because no one else would step up? Pulled back into emailing people because those 12-year-old girls just have so much power over you? Are the allegations that you molested someone, sent inappropriate pictures, what?

I would write an email to her explaining things better than you do here and not have anymore conversations in email or otherwise with girls her age. "
"Well, it might be a cultural thing, but I also reacted pretty strongly to not letting your mother stay at your home. She is your family, you probably lived together for around 18 years, she has raised and cared for you for all this time. Now she asks to stay for just ONE week with her son, even on an air mattress on the floor, but because this may cause some discomfort for the introverted guy, he wants her to pay for a hotel instead. For me, it is just a given that you give back to your parents, and in this case I really do not think much is being asked. This is, then, not considering the water damage, and assuming that she had been a good mother to her son. "
Oh so it's OK then to point a gun at you. He was drunk after all. Wtf that's such a weak excuse. It doesn't matter why someone pointed a gun at you...because they pointed a gun at you. If you had a daughter and her bf raped her or killed her by shooting her do you then go oh but he's was drunk it's OK lol.

"Yes, I also saw that he still has wedding pics up in the home. I can really see why you are feeling like you were cheated out of an experience - you're getting it from all angles that other people had their dream weddings and you didn't. I agree with others - there's something going on here that he hasn't acknowledged yet, as to why he chose to be so negative this time around on the wedding aspects, but I don't know what the answer is. Just want to validate you that it doesn't seem at all that you are being shallow or superficial. "
"Meh just roll with it.

Everyone else here is too negative.

You are 21 years old, don't take it too seriously, experience life.

I dated my 100% enemy 0% match 0% friend on OkCupid and it gave me a lot of perspective on what I really wanted in a relationship.

Obviously it didn't go past the first date, but I gave it an honest shot.

But yeah, don't get whipped or get too obsessed with her. Just experience who she is mutually and be respectful, and if it starts affecting you negatively, get out of it because she's probably pretty crazy."
"This is really not okay. Just because *he* thinks you're being emotional does not make him automatically logical, nor does it make you wrong. Your edit made me sad because I don't think you're being shallow at all. It sucks if your husband shuts down your emotions and needs by claiming some higher ""logical"" ground. Also, is he even that logical? Not wanting a wedding party, a DJ, a Saturday night event, etc. All stems from emotions about those things, not logic."

"&gt;he sincerely doesn't want to hurt me and as much as it may sound hard to believe, he is a very genuinely kind person. 

Being kind sometimes or most of the time doesn't mean you can't also be terribly cruel and intentionally hurt the people that love you. He is doing this over and over again and you have told him it hurts you. At this point, it is intentional.

&gt;he mentioned that he wasn't attracted to overweight girls in several situations...let some jokes slip that compared me to a whale and cow, and how my butt wasn't nice enough ""to be a cheerleader"" (it sounds weird, but it's contextual).

"The email could mean he has a watersports kink, but it could also be the opposite: that he isn't in to it and thinks that you having to pee so much, including occasionally pausing sex to do so, is causing him to associate the two. His own discomfort with your totally normal bodily functions is making him avoid sex with you. 

If that's the case, then he just sent you a bunch of porn as punishment. Like, he thinks you're gross and subjecting him to it, so he's now going to subject you to these gross links. 

When he gets back, you can ask him what was up with that email. If the answer is anything besides ""my account got hacked and started sending out spam,"" I'd break up with him."
More like enough that specific detail could be an identifier.
"&gt;I requested that my husband also abstain from alcohol during the course of my pregnancy and during the time that I’m breastfeeding.

WHY would you do this? OP, you get extra oxcytocin hits, he doesn't. I'm a fan of drinking, but this is unreasonable. He's going to be grouchy and stressed, you're going to be grouchy and stressed, at least one of you needs to stay chill.

&gt;I’m more concerned with doing what is right by our child

This has nothing to do with the kid, you just don't want to be left out of the fun and I do understand that, being the sober one sucks. 
But your kid is is going to be fine regardless of whether he has alcohol or not. It's going to eat, sleep, and shit and cry exclusively for at least 3 months. Really, your kid is going to act more like a drunk person than anything else.


It was terrible of him to ditch out on your appointment with no warning, and being absent is certainly frustrating. "

"Based on your post mom 45 has cardiac issues with multiple surgeries, abuse history and chaotic abusive family history. Now you want to keep peace in the family and help mom or distance yourself is this correct? 
My sense is you have tried to be the peacemaker for a long time and now you have reached a point where you can no longer keep the peace. First and foremost, self care is really important and learning to recognize subtle abuse triggers. If you have the energy you can try to keep peace but you can reach personal burnout quicker each time out of guilt or other issues. I would suggest trying to find an abuse support group in your area."

"It isn't that at all. In a serious relationship this sort of thing should be talked about thoroughly before any big decisions, and it sounds like OP surprised her with the proposal without even talking to her about it first."
You should go see a lawyer yourself and ask them all these questions.
Then he has lost sight of what is important in life. He's sold his soul to the altar of money. 
You seem to think you need him to convince him he's abusive. You don't. What you need is to get out of the relationship.

"You're looking for permission to break up with her. You're welcome to do so. If this is your attitude, she probably is better off.

But keep in mind that what she did was very generous. I'm under the impression egg donation isn't trivial on the physical side for the woman. The kids are only biologically related to her. She didn't carry them, she didn't have sex with their fathers, she isn't raising them. If you were to marry and have kids with her, those would the first kids for both of you. It would be her first time being pregnant, giving birth, being fully responsible for a child."

"To piggy-back on this, one fashion rule that might help her figure out ""classy sexy"" is only showing off only one body part at a time. That means showing cleavage OR your legs OR your back etc., never all at one time. Showing off one asset and leaving the rest to the imagination and all that. If she really likes flashy materials like sequins, get her a small clutch, scarf, or hair accessory. Generally, the louder the material, the less of it you should use.

In regards to her slut shaming comment, you can acknowledge that she's totally right that she *should* be able to wear whatever she wants in any context without being judged. Until the world changes, though, she's going to face negative consequences for flaunting social norms."
"I was pre-eclamptic, in and out of the hospital the last month under observation. Pregnancy for me, like your gf, was miserable. We induced at 37 weeks. Labor was longish but normal. I and my baby were totally safe. Modern medicine has some great technologies to offer. We were both monitored closely the entire time, and if I had needed emergency cesarean for any reason it could have happened it minutes. But I didn't. I had a great delivery, excellent recovery, and baby is totally healthy. This isn't downton abbey. Pre eclampsia, especially sight early and monitored closely as you guys are doing, is a very standard complication.

By allowing her to continue her toxic behavior, you're reinforcing that it's ok for her to continue acting like this because of her mental issues. As a result, she won't learn to control these issues, she won't change her behavior, and you'll always be on the defensive. That's not healthy, and it needs to stop."
"I always clarify when ordering that I do need gluten free for ""actual boring medical reasons"" to differentiate myself from the hipsters. Although I'm grateful for the hipsters who made the demand for GF stuff high enough for me to have a choice of pancake mixes, I do feel that I have to emphasize that some of us will actually get sick from it."
"Honestly, he is going to have to get used to it with your baby due soon. He won't be able to party with his friends then, so they may as whey get a taste of that now. Good sign that he was upfront with you about the party."

"You keep mentioning that you don't know how to tell Rachel.  That makes no sense at all. Use your words, that's how. I think what you really mean is, ""I don't know how to tell Rachel about all of this without risking that she will think less of me.""  And you know what? There just is no way. That she might think less of you is the risk you take. But it's also the only way to defuse the disgruntled ex-girlfriends. "
I love this book and what an incredibly great suggestion. 
"That's not how sociopathy works.

I agree he is in desperate need of professional treatment, but don't demonize him by armchairing him with a stigmatized and frightening ""diagnosis."" The American Psychiatric Association doesn't even _allow_ children that young to be diagnosed as such, and for damn good reason. "

"I'm wondering why a married man is so worried about what an ex girlfriend is doing.

Also the way you went about texting her would have creeped me out so I would not have responded to you at all. "
"Rivers aren't the place to get complacent about water safety.  The river my husband and I worked on (whitewater rafting) saw two river deaths in one day on what's considered a relatively tame river.  Those PFDs can save your life, especially if you're out of reach of the raft/tube.  They allow you to float with your feet up and avoid foot entrapment.  

I would find a place that has rentals and see if she could rent from there.  Just approach her with tact and say ""Hey, I'm really excited that you're coming on this trip, but I just looked at our gear and we don't have a PFD that will fit you.  This place will rent one to you for $x.""  It doesn't have to be awkward.  Bailey blogs about her weight loss journey, it's not like she's unfamiliar with her weight.  The more matter of fact about it you are, the less awkward it will be.  When people are too ""polite"" about it, it makes it feel like her weight is this subject that's so horrible it just can't be spoken of straightforwardly."
"Cutting them off at this time is not necessarily a permanent divorce. If my sisters or parents said nasty things about my wife in response to someone else wronging her, brother or not, I would cut them off for a while too. The issue isn't necessarily the brother's transgression, but the family's reaction. If this happened to my wife and my family's reaction was to call her a whore, you better believe they'd be cut off for a good long time.

The brother violated their trust, privacy, and safety. The rest of the family violated basic human decency. I get what you're saying, but it's really hard to imagine OP overreacting here."
"I can't say he's ever shared it with anyone else. He loves to be doted on. That's for sure. Not as much. I try to give him attention and affection, but there are some things I just can't do right now. If he would help me more then it might be possible, but I'm the only caretaker of our son right now. "
"Don't waste another second in this relationship.  Even if the MIL, and the Ex decided they want this to get better for you it would still take years to get it all working like a machine.  Except the MIL and the ex have no intention of making the situation better for you.  

Run and never look back."

&gt; Well, that's never been an effective parenting strategy.

Right?  My husband was abused by his care takers growing up, and sometimes he opens his mouth to say stuff like this to our young kids.  I know what's coming out, and I shoot him the glare that says ""uh, don't you dare say that"" before it comes out of his mouth.  

Awesome way to parent a child who's mourning the death of her mother: scare the bejeezeus out of her to make her comply, because fear is a great motivator.  Fantastic. /s

"Thanks for your comment. I think you're right about them trying to 'fix' him, or find something 'wrong' with him that makes it not his fault. It's awkward because there are elderly members of the family who are standing by him and defending him, and I'm not sure they even know the details of his crime. It's very hard to stand in front of an elderly person and go into that detail. "
"Just disengage from the conversation entirely at this point. By asking her not to vent and then saying anything else, all you're accomplishing is giving her points that she feels the need to refute. Actually close the conversation. Ignore it when she texts about it. If she brings it up in person just say ""I respect your viewpoint and I'm not interested in discussing it further.""

She is not going to move out on her own if she is talking about needing a new job first, so I would issue that 30-day notice today."

"Block them both 100%. Tell Rachel upfront and honestly about your history, and don't try to gloss over the things that you did wrong. Sounds like she'll find out the truth anyways, so better from you than them.

Maybe do some introspection about why you find it hard to stay faithful and keep going for girls who are a little young."
"Wtf? She owned her sexuality. She made her own decision and did what she wanted to do. The only way a feminist should have a problem with that is if the guy didn't consent.

Anyone in her group who judges her harshly needs a wake-up call. Feminism is about women being in control of their own lives -- sexually, one thing it means is women choosing to have sex when they want to (with consent from anyone else who is involved, of course) rather than when someone else says it's allowed."
A rather tender subject.

"&gt;And I know he's thinking ""they've already put so much into it, as did I, what would giving up now mean?""

It would mean facing reality, growing up, and getting a job. It would mean being a full and equal partner to you. You have given this fantasy of his FIVE YEARS of your time and money! Five years of shoveling god only knows how much cash (btw, it's a very bad sign that you can't even bear to track how much) into a black hole. Enough is enough. If his parents want to continue supporting their kids in their expensive hobby, that's on them, but it's time for you to be done. You deserve so much more than being an ATM machine.

&gt;I read these comments and I don't want to make this one-sided, I'm by no means perfect, if it weren't for the business I'd be counting my blessings for having won the relationship lottery, truly. 

I never read the OP's stories thinking that they are perfect. I look for facts, and in this case, the facts are very clear. He's been running a ""business"" for five years and hasn't made a dime. He's perfectly okay with you supporting him 100 percent, with no end date in mind. He's willing to take your money, month after month after month, to fund what is essentially a very expensive hobby. I'm not even going to call it a business because businesses exist to make money. This is more of a charity -- funded by you and his parents. Worse, it's a charity that only benefits your boyfriend and his deadbeat sister.

&gt;The plan was for him to work and me pursuing another degree, add to that family influence + a couple of bad business decisions, a few other elements and it's gotten to the situation we're now in.

You know, it's really really easy to say that the plan is (all these wonderful things that would have benefited you.) What you need to take a hard look at are his *actions*. He hasn't had an income-generating job in half a decade. He hasn't supported you getting another degree. He hasn't even learned from his mistakes and made changes to the so-called business. He's apparently perfectly happy to coast along, taking advantage of you and pretending that he's doing a business.

I'm sure he has a lot of great qualities and I don't doubt that you love him. Unfortunately, I also don't doubt that he's using you. Not in an evil mustache-twirling gonna-take-this-girl-for-all-she's-worth sorta way, but using you none the less. He knows this situation is awful for you, but he's done nothing to change it. 

Want to know for sure? Pull the plug. Tell him you will be investing no further money. His response will tell you everything you need to know.

"That title made me burst out laughing LOL

But seriously, I would kick her out of my house for that"
"Did we read the same post? She went through a pregnancy, and a termination of it. She realised that she just couldn't stay with the guy any longer. She wrote a letter explaining all this to him, he even posted it. For whatever reason (maybe she feared she would be too emotional, we don't know), she did this when he was out of the house. He is posting about taking revenge on her, happily, it seems like he realises how bad that makes him sound. "
"Firstly, words.  He'd be *borrowing* money from you, and you'd be *loaning* money to him.  

Secondly, you are 100% right to not loan him the money.  $18k is an *insane* amount to ask for from a significant other for, like, anything that isn't a life-saving emergency surgery.  You'd probably never see most of that money again (and he'd always have some excuse) unless you literally sued him for it, and who has the time for that kind of bullshit?  Just don't do it.

Thirdly, he's being a manipulative ass for getting upset that you had to think about it.  It's a big decision, and even if you were on board, you'd still have to *think* about it.  Want to bet that in a while he comes back to you and offers to ""forgive"" you for your hesitation, as long as you eventually agree to do the thing he wants?  That's the wrong deal for you to make, but because of his initial behavior, it now sort-of seems like a compromise between your two positions, you know?  But it's not really a compromise -- it's him manipulating you to get exactly what he wanted all along.  "

"I have heard so many parents say ""I love my kids, but if a person knows they don't want kids,  the best thing they can do is not have kids."" Kids are insanely hard work. 

My husband and I don't have kids. It was the best decision for us.  I spent a week with my friend and her 2 year-old, and I was out of my damn mind by the third day, it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  Worse than my botched gall-bladder surgery that had me in the hospital for a month.  And he was a quiet, well-behaved kid!

***I would rather be in a hospital for a month after a botched surgery than spend another week with a 2 year-old***

Imagine if I hadn't had that experience,  and I just let my friends persuade me that having kids was easy and I would love it if it were my own and so on. What if I didn't? What if I hated every minute of it? What if I regret it everyday of my life having a child that I let someone else talk me into having?

Where I'm from if someone is riding a bike its because they had a dui. 
"&gt; Like what, specifically?

Dude, it's like riding a bike. You can read all the bike riding instruction manuals in the world, watch all of the ""how to ride a bike"" videos, interview professional cyclists on proper bike riding, and even with all of that research, none of it will prevent you from wiping out the first time you hop on a bike. Just like you won't be able to hide your skinned elbow and the bike laying there on the ground from the neighbor kid who can ride his bike without holding onto the handle bars and was watching you the whole time, you won't be able to hide the fact that you're not experienced from this girl you're hoping to fuck.

My advice, give her at least a subtle heads up that you're not very experienced, or tell her that ""it's been a long time"" if sure that admitting this is equivalent to your balls being cut off, and just follow her lead. Everybody is different and even two people with experience can take some time to be firing on all cylinders sexually."
"&gt;Later I received an email from a school counselor telling me they want me to come down for a meeting because ""someone has shown concern over your safety.""

"Do you think that the younger kids would be helped by a counselor?  They sound like they're pretty stressed by their brother's behavior, and that's without trying to factor in whatever their parents did.  I know a lot of families with ill or unruly kids can, totally unintentionally, neglect the ""good"" or healthy kids.  Checking in with the littler ones and giving them some extra support is a way to avoid that trap."
Yup. OP is the punchline. Fuck those people
"So I'd start by describing the current situation to him. Just describe. Here is how often I cook, these are the limitations re: nutrition and timing you have expressed, this is how long it takes me to plan, prepare, and clean up after (?) meals. Then express your feelings. ""The situation as I have described makes me feel XYZ because ABC."" 

I would open the conversation by asking him to just listen until you gave done the above (literally say ""I'm going to describe the situation as it stands and explain my feelings about the situation. Then we can have a discussion. But please let me get out my thoughts first.""

I would also make a list of your grievances in bullet point form ahead of time, to help organize your thoughts. I've found it helpful in difficult conversations like this to kind of role play in my head -- if he responds with X, I will need to say Y.

You also need to anticipate what a good outcome would look like for you, and to aim for that. Do you want him to cook two nights a week? ACTIVELY help and learn from you in the kitchen for every dinner for the next month? What do you want as a first step, and what does your ideal distribution of labor look like in the long term? 

I feel for you, and I understand wanting to fix this situation. But you should also think about what you'll do if he reacts badly to this conversation. Or if he ""helps"" for a week or two and then falls back on expecting you to do everything. Prepare for that scenario. In my experience, people (mostly dudes, sorry capable dudes) who have been waited on well into adulthood and who feel entitled to other people's (mostly women's!) free labor are generally NOT receptive to suddenly being expected to pull their own weight, and as you say, ADULT.

Good luck..."

Well, you've put your parents in a position where they either have to pretend you're an idiot or deal with your meltdowns over their dating. 
It's not fair to get mad at them for trying to protect you from something you've made it clear you can't cope with.

"You and your wife need to be on the same page about discipline and how other people discipline your kids.

I don't agree with slapping a kid, either. Whether it's true Mexicans use physical discipline on a whole, it doesn't make it right. Their culture's parenting traditions (if this is true) don't get override your culture's parenting traditions; it's for you and your wife to figure out what to do.

I suggest counseling."
"Tell your boyfriend the truth.

"My mum always used to threaten to send me away to live with my grandma as a kid when I was ""naughty"" because she said she didn't like me. I got major abandonment issues from that which I am still dealing with to this day.

"
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure this was just the POS's attempt to silence you and intimidate you with the lawyer, and have the lawyer around to make sure he didn't say anything incriminating. What's more worrying is that if he attended with the lawyer, the lawyer can testify to things you said during your session. I dunno about the legalities of that. 

I would be a lot less trusting of your therapist that she agreed to this situation. Who was paying her for these sessions? Why did she accept this as appropriate? Was she aware of his abuse and his goal of shutting you up so you wouldn't go to the police? I can't see why she, as your advocate or as a neutral third party, would agree to this. "
"I get what you're saying but when I invite someone or allow them to come on a trip with me, it's my feeling that it's ""our"" trip in a lot of ways. I don't know what their actual communication was like but I can't imagine just dictating all the terms with so little input. I get he's had a bad experience but I do think he could have given even a tiny bit of importance to her plans or feelings too. "

"It's easy to dismiss someone's views as ""Puritanical,"" as you did. However if someone has a track record of something it is a factor in deciding to commit to that person. I would think twice if I was dating someone who banged a different guy every weekend in college, because that reveals something about her. It indicates what her views on relationships and sex are, for one thing. It wouldn't automatically be a deal breaker, but it would be a big red flag. You can try to belittle the previous commentor's opinion and dismiss it as ""puritanical,"" but judging someone based on their behavior (both past and current) is EXACTLY how dating works. 

That said, if a guy has banged a hundred girls and expects the girl he dates to be virgins, obviously that's hypocritical and scummy behavior. But the point is if a potential partner has had a lot of casual sex, the other person is completely right to decide this isn't the person for them based on very different attitudes and values on sexuality.

"Completely unacceptable. You need to sit her down and tell her that leaving for four days without telling you where she was going was a complete dealbreaker for you, and not getting in contact with you while she was there only made things worse.

However, you need a LOT of people under you to actually try to make a career out of it. If OP's girlfriend is only annoying her friends/family and not getting any people under her at this point she won't be successful at this."
I know you want to remain her friend however the children are at risk and she needs a lot of help. The only way I know to help her at this point is you have to call social services if her family cannot help with financial or other means before someone gets hurt badly. In most cases you can report this anonymously to a 1800 number in the states.
"Yeah, the ""full-length"" proverb is really dubiously apocryphal. Meanwhile, ""blood is thicker than water"" can be found in that form going back to the 12th century."
"Sorry, I know I responded somewhere but things keep getting lost. They divorced, she's still alive, living in another country. They divorced pretty amicably."
"Yeah, her ""you're smart and dumb at the same time"" comment just shows her own close-mindedness. She thinks you're dumb when you voice any opinion she doesn't 100% agree with. "
"Considering she founded your relationship on a lie, I don't blame you for having trust issues.  If you want this marriage to work, I highly recommend you look into getting some couple's counselling sessions.  

Hopefully a neutral 3rd party can help the two of you re-establish some trust to start building from.

"&gt; It most definitely is the bride's day, and he needs to get over it.

No, it's not. A wedding is about celebrating the love of a couple. Sometimes the bride likes to be in the centre, sometimes the man but it's certainly not just ""the bride's day"".

&gt; If he tries to play the ""fairness card"", and claims the wedding shouldn't be all about the bride, ask him if there is some other way... some other day... where you can do something for him.

A wedding, like everything else in a relationship, is a compromise. And yeah, people who have a ""fake"" wedding without telling EVERYONE but fear what others might think about their fiancé's unusual clothes are certainly no hypocrites."
"I'm guessing it's a good thing they aren't. Sure is going to make the divorce cheaper!

OP's already got her husband demanding to be the center of attention and not taking the ""wedding"" seriously. Which OP seems to be taking seriously. That's pretty telling. I'd love to hear who originally brought up that it was ""just a piece of paper"". I got 10 bucks on the boyfriend being a commit-a-phobe. They seem to have no idea of how taxes work or any other legal safeties that come with being married. It may seem like ""ok, we'll just do the paperwork"" now, but that's going to be a bit of a rude awakening the first time they forget something they should have done. "
"This is my ideal situation for sure. 

I want to move back to the UK and have my daughter come live with me and go to university in the UK. My wife went to university in the UK too and is very supportive of this - I guess time will tell on that one though."
omg you keep avoiding the question!! Why don't YOU help as well anyway?
"so SMALL update. 

I reactivated my Bugs Bunny account and I have been blocked from the group. I wonder if somebody tipped the admins off. So I just made a new Facebook account using a generic name, and got added to the group in 15 minutes. So yeah it is easy to access. "
"Why is Leah the cut off point? Why don't you respect yourself enough to draw the same line on the sand? Here is the stark reality; your mom had spent your entire life abusing you with food and negative reinforcement around it. You're finally getting past it and yet you continue to let her undermine you. Every comment she makes about Leah's food is meant as a dig at you. 

If you continue to let her talk to you like this, it will slowly filter to Leah - even if she doesn't say it directly, Leah will hear it accidentally. You need to tell your mom the comments stop now. Today. You will never be in her company again to hear her make these comments. Then come up with a scale of consequences for your mom. The first time she comments (because she will) then tell her you won't talk to her for a week. Each time she makes an unhealthy comment then extend the time that you don't see her. If you haven't, spend some time in the sub JUSTNOMIL . 

To provide a healthy environment for your daughter you need to be healthy too. You can't be while your mother is still undermining you. "
"&gt;but he initially wanted all of this (except for the child, I wanted that).

You're saying he didn't want kids? How did that conversation go?"
"I worked in the electronic repair industry, specifically geared towards cell phones for over 6 years. Unfortunately, no shop is going to take you seriously and dismiss you as a tweaker (unfortunately we get this regularly). 

Because the unit has water damage, which can lie dormant for years or kill your phone immediately, I suggest claiming your warranty and get a replacement unit. That way you can be sure there is no bugging software.

I'd also just save your contacts to your sim card and move them over to the handset that way. Or sync them to your gmail account. I would not use androids restore feature as it might copy it (any bug) over. 

edit: (any bug)"
"&gt;If OP is really as happy as she says she is, who gives a fuck what these people are saying/thinking?  
   
And why write paragraphs detailing who paid for what, with so many petty asides about the bride and groom?  90% of the post was irrelevant saltiness.  So she posts a lot on social media.  Who cares that you saved your wedding money while they spent theirs.... GET OVER IT."
"Right? ""I'm fat but I'm not the bad kind of fat. And now I'm dieting but not the annoying kind of dieting."" -.-"
"You have to put yourself first and foremost. Don't turn down this opportunity just because your sister is unreasonably dependent on you. You are not her husband and it's not as if she's going to be left completely on her own, and it's unfair of her to try and manipulate you into staying.  
Definitely take the offer if it's something that you want to do. Your sister and bro-in-law are just being selfish."
"She has been told explicitly. Its why Im annoyed by it.
"

"&gt; Does she have problems admitting mistakes in other areas of life?

Not in my experience. She can be stubborn, yes. But she's also very good at discussing a compromise and acting on it. This time it's a different story altogether."
"Um, I've gamed my entire life. I've played hundreds of games. Some of them very frustrating that have really pissed me off... but I've never done anything like that.

Maybe once in a while I'll get pissed, roll my eyes, shake my head and say, ""Fuck!"" But that's probably about it. I can't imagine going off like that. That sounds really crazy.

If he's not having some kind of psychotic break or a seizure or something, he really needs to cut that shit out. I'd be embarrassed if I acted like that. I love games, but seriously... it's just a game. He needs to learn to control his outbursts."
Wow. Thank you so much... I'll always keep this comment in mind
But poor people are so gosh darn lame!
"Hey man,

I read your entire post and I've just gathered that you seem like a good dude with a good head on your shoulders. 

That being said, you know this could be a ""re-start"" in your life. Those material possessions, international trips, etc... they can be put on hold and possibly enjoyed more if you are working doing something you actually enjoy. Finding out what that is is a very hard thing to do though. I think you should sit down and talk with your wife. Explain to her how you're feeling - you feel no purpose or passion right now and you're sick and tired of going through the corporate cycle just to be laid off or forced to quit again. 

If you're okay financially (if you can eat, pay your bills, afford to enjoy life while living within your means) is there anything you'd like to try out? Do you like to cook? Make coffee? Bartend? Make beer? Do you like working with animals? What makes you feel at ease? What could you do that you wouldn't MIND taking home with you (or you wouldn't mind leaving at work)? Thinking about the next cool recipe you can pitch to your manager? Thinking of new brews to try out? What gets you excited? I know most of my ideas are food related but that's all I know - maybe you are more in the tech side of things... in that case, what really gets you pumped? What are your hobbies, what gets you excited to read about?

I also want to say that there are so many stupid quotes saying ""you *must* go after your passion"" and ""you shouldn't need an alarm clock to wake you up, you should just be motivated by your passions"" (Yes, I use spotify free) but I think that's a lot of shit. Not only are we NOT all handed a ton of money to go play around with, but I think we don't just PICK a passion, we sort of evolve into it. It doesn't happen overnight and it's NOT easy. But we need to give ourselves that opportunity and that time to explore and try new things. 

I was on track to become a career flight attendant (with seniority and patience, you get paid a TON of money, work 8-10 days a month, and have ridiculous flight benefits) but I quit because I was miserable. I am now baking doughnuts for a tiny indie coffee house in Chicago, and I love it. It's not my ""passion"", but there's so much more for me to learn and... I'm actually *good* at it. I never would have ever thought I'd be here just a year after quitting the airlines, but I'm glad that I gave myself that chance. And because the nature of my job allows me to leave everything at work, when I come home (and after doing adult things like grocery shop, clean, etc) I am free to pursue whichever hobby I'm interested in at the moment (including binge-watching netflix). 

And there was definitely the ""what the hell am I doing? I could be en route to ____!!! I used to work 15 days a month and now I'm working all these hours? WHAT HAVE I DONE!"" but then I just think about the pros and cons and I know in my gut I made the right choice. It sounds like you know that this path isn't the right one for you, and it may take a few more rounds in the corporate cycle for you to figure it out but I know you will. 

Sorry this is all over the place. I enjoyed two craft Chicago beers before writing this. 

*edit* I am also 29.

"Could pull a Justin Trudeau.

Mom, dad, it's 2016."
"Both of those are common red flags of cheating... and may feed into a desire for him to get something back for his recent gains in social standing.  No one can know for sure but like, I don't think it's a reach to speculate that he's cheating, and probably with someone he has easy access too with less moral scruples. "
"Well, for me it's the unusual situation that OP has described her family as Jewish Americans, but somehow they all speak German?  "
"Maybe he doesnt want to move now and then again in 7 months. Maybe he feels like your apartments is yours, and he wants to start over with you. Maybe he just doesnt really like your place enough to move in. You will never know until you ask him to move in with you now. You agreed to move in together when your lease is up, if you want something different than you have to tell him. "
"In theory she shouldn't have to explain basic shit about babies to a guy who decided he wanted to have one.  But she made the decision to marry and have a child with an idiot, so now her options are trying to educate him and get him on board or leaving him and raising this kid as a single mom likely with little actual help from the father.  Probably worth trying the first option first, though I wouldn't bet on him coming around. "
"I can't believe that this is serious advice. They're her parents and they're not being awful or anything, just different cultures values. "
"&gt; I would have checked on him

That's nice of you. You probably should have communicated to him that you wanted him to check in on you a few times. 

You were capable of texting him to give him an update, and you didn't.

You had taken an antihistamine. No texts from you + you took a pill that could make you tired... My mind would go to ""Oh, she's asleep. I won't bother her"". *So* inconsiderate. "
"I'm the same size as your boyfriend, if you want to ask any questions just send me a PM."
"Dude, normal mistakes are staying out 5 minutes past curfew or having a forbidden beer when you're 18. Not sexually violating people. Quit it with the persecution complex, or acting like anything the OP has done matters. You'd rather vilify some guy for a hypothetical action than the guy who committed a *real* crime."
"The way you're selling your agenda is really gross. Repeating ""innocent child"" many times and then playing on his hopes ""is there really no way that you are the dad of this child"". Seriously just stop "
Maybe you should just not be in a relationship with Sarah. Because it sounds like if you got the chance you would cheat and that is not fair to her.
"PA to a successful businessman? Um yeah, that's a real career. One that pays better than yours, it turns out. "
"Um, why are you marrying this guy?"
