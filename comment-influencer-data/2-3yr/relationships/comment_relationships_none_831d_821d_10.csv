Actually it makes you less smelly. Testosterone makes you smellier. In that sense mentioning she's trans and not taking hormones yet is relevant.
"Definitely, in fact I think it would be weird *not* to start talking in this situation. It all seems so normal to me."
"Your girlfriend obviously shouldn't have sex with you if she doesn't want to. That said her reason makes no sense. ""She's afraid of the pain of penetrative sex so wants to want for marriage"". Well yeah, it will hurt a bit the first time but that will be the case whether or not she's married! Usually people choose to wait for marriage for religious reasons, is she religious? If she doesn't want to have sex she should at least be honest with you about why.

It is not at all abnormal that you are frustrated after 4 years! And if you stay with her there seems no prospect anything will change. Sexual compatibility is important in a relationship and it seems like you two are just not compatible. I'd recommend breaking up, there are plenty of women out there with normal healthy asx drives. "
"Like others said, he's doing the right thing here. But it's also really important for you to know there is *nothing* you've done wrong or should feel guilty about. You're the patient, none of this is your fault. What's happened is on him, and he's taking the appropriate steps to address it. Please please don't feel guilty!"
There's nothing wrong with you. You just haven't been in a relationship where both people wanted the same things and the situations haven't been right. You live and you learn and I know everyone probably says this to you but you will meet someone one day who will make you happy! 
"Yeah, can you see how that (except for lip service) won't be your wedding? It'll be your mom's wedding and if we were taking bets, I'd lay money on her wearing a white fancy dress."
"My husband does stuff like what you did. Forgetting his ID when we go to new breweries, forgetting to pay bills until it's too late...It's really annoying when important things that most adults would take care of are put off until the last minute when there is no time to remedy them. I'm assuming you had at least a month to make sure you had the appropriate documents. Did you ever check? Why did you check the night before when there was no time to order a new one? Because of your carelessness and disorganization the trip she hoped for was cancelled and she's having to settle for a rainy weekend through no fault of her own. I'd be pissed too. You didn't ""fix"" it, ""fixing"" it would have been getting a new certificate. 

Edit- it also gets exhausting mentally having to worry if someone else is doing things that affect you "
"I used to work in the finance area in London. They drank. They drank ALOT. It was a coping mechanism to deal with the stress. The type of job your wife does - i bet she has managers demanding things yesterday in perfect condition. If she gets it wrong, it impacts a number of people. It's hard. It's stressful. Subways is so much less stressed in comparison. Listen to what your wife is trying to tell you rather than immediately panicking about yourself. She's falling apart and needs help. Pull up your socks and talk to her. Counselling if necessary. 

Carry on and Keep Calm."
"Yeah a little schadenfreude, which is German for ""getting off"" on someone's pain."
"I don't think he would be vindictive with a recommendation letter. I would have him send it to me first, for sure, so that I could include it with my resume. 

He's really good at being fake, so I'm sure he'd be fine on a phone call. He's always said he wants me to be successful and I just don't think he'd screw me in that way. 

Then again, I also didn't think he would cheat. "
"Honestly she isn't a good friend, but who cares if she was drunk. The more important betrayal is your SO cheating on you. For sure get rid of the friend, but do not blame her and then stay with him. "
"&gt; like they are not happy or good at anything.

THAT is something you should add to your post, and it's what you should focus on.  Those are the thoughts and words of someone struggling with depression or anxiety or a personal crisis.  Focus on that, not tour feeling that he's letting you down by wanting to have what you feel is a less prestigious career.

ASK him why he feels those things, and then just listen.  Stop judging him for how he is trying to manage those feelings and listen.  Try to find out why he's feeling so defeated and useless and support him!"

"Because there was no fight, no break up, nothing with the relationship that failed. There could have been a genuine, deep love there that was ripped from her by an accident of fate.

This isn't her chasing someone who dumped her or her regretting a past decision that caused a break up."
"If your parents are totally not open to any kind of compromise, I suspect it's your parents, not your girlfriend who are being unreasonable. Is this just a morals thing, or a power thing now? How often do your parents ""tell"" you to do something?"
"If she treats you the way you want to be treated, then maybe focus on that, but you can't make yourself love or be attracted to some one just because you know deep down that you should. 

 If you feel that there's no way to get past her 'appearance', then you should move on. It's very hard (for me) to understand how someone can be attractive to you, then all the sudden a couple years later it's gone so far that you don't find her attractive enough.

But you can't force it. If you can't find the attraction both inside and out, then you should move on and stop wasting both of your time."

"Just curious, how handsome are you? Are you a 10 with a weightlifter's body?"
"I kind of disagree with this unless OP gives us more info on their interactions.

Question OP. Does your girlfriend ever plan dates? If so, how well thought are they? I can understand her disappointment if she always plans out super extravagant and well-thought out dates and you don't reciprocate. However, if this is just an expectation she has of you, I don't think this is very fair. This was a play she wanted to see, you bought tickets for her. The date was the play. Yeah you could have left earlier to get food, but ultimately this was still a date.

Honestly she comes across very spoiled here. But again, I need to know the dynamic of the relationship beyond just this to make an assessment. "
"Lol but he was going into the navy! 

How were they supposed to get those sweet, sweet benefits otherwise?

Sounds like a depend-apotamus in the making.

'You can't divorce me! I'll lose my tricare!'"
"I really didn't need anything more than my typical botox.  which is usually 900 and i get that once a year... 

They put so much crap in my face -- it was insane.  I am still trying to figure out how to get some of it dissovolved and i would rather pay someone else to do it and not have him and his ""trainer"" involved.

If I fight this though -- it will be the end of us -- that's for certain. "
"At the very least he was using a personal issue against you to prove a point. At the worst he is a sexist jerk who think feminism is garbage and treats you like crap. I don't know about you, but I would definitely not see someone like that as partner material. "
"You look fine, lad. No one notices the uniform except you.

But, maybe don't make a move on the girl you're supposed to be tutoring."
Not any of our business to ask that.
"Plastic surgery is better for specific things, like ""I hate my recessed chin"" or ""my crooked nose dominates my face"". Changing those types of things really does increase confidence and quality of life, and doesn't lead to obsessive surgery.

The ""I'm an ugly mf'er and don't deserve my boyfriend"" does sound like therapy would be more useful. A good therapist can help put the desire and expectations for surgery into perspective, too. "
"Yeah, I don't think the therapist is pulling this out of the air. OP is an unreliable narrator."
"um I would be PISSSSSSED. You guys have been together long enough and are sharing your life / home together so therefore he should have been honest about his income. He was purposefully keeping you in the dark. I understand wanting to save money. I really do. But as a partner, if one makes a ton more than the other I think it's fair to have them help from time to time if needed . For example, desperately needing a new vehicle. Before my husband and I got married we had the money talk. He shared what he made and I shared what I made. He said saving is very important to him. He makes double what I make so we tailored the bills to reflect that but also so we could save the same %. Not the same amount , but the percentage of our income. We wanted to both be able to have an opportunity to save. Rightfully so. 
I think it's not JUST about the money, but it's an important factor. I don't know the depth of his cheapness. Not chipping in for certain things, not willing to go half on a trip to the beach etc. I can understand you feeling deflated. This is a huge breach of trust. At the very least he could have said ""hey I make this , but I want to pretend I make this so I can save for my future and hopefully OUR future."" Otherwise, from the outside looking in, it screams greed. 
I'm gonna need an update on this situation. "
"Who doesn't like blading around at night, twirling a pair of pantyhose with a bar of soap in it over your head while scowling at passersby?

"Perhaps keep all the food for one meal in a bag marked with the day and the dish ""Tuesday - fajitas"" then he'll clue in not to use it?  And def have a snack drawer.  You can still be frugal about it."
Exactly and that really tells you how genuine the relationships were too.
"I currently have a medical condition that causes me to burp regularly. (They are actually somewhere between a burp and a hiccup -- I call them ""squawks."") I don't think I could easily make them quieter or hold them in. And I don't have much warning when they're coming -- maybe a few seconds. I think if I tried to hold them in it would probably give me heartburn.

This may or may not be your colleague's problem, but don't assume you understand his experience in his own body."
"Right, and OP's mom apparently says she doesn't like him because he is irresponsible (while OP ascribes other motives to her). So I want to know what other incidents ""fun"" husband has pulled, maybe not quite on this level, but there must be some if even OP avoids ""fun"" husband. Maybe this is the straw that broke the camel's back for her, so while she seems to be quite out of line, if OP has downplayed other egregious behavior I might understand why her mom is just done."
"It sounds like your husband has issues with alcohol and boundaries. 

I think the appropriate middle ground right now, is to go someplace where you won't be pressured and think about what you want to do.

Turn off your phone. Spend a few days away from your husband.

I personally think that your husband exposing your body to your friends and then it getting posted on facebook is probably divorce worthy. I don't think it was a ""timely"" photo. He probably told a friend what he was going to do and that friend photographed it, posted it to facebook and even in 5 minutes, you better believe it was downloaded and saved to people's phones.

Is that the kind of person you want to be with the rest of your life? I mean he is 32!!!!! The fact that he is that old and that stupid is a real problem. 

Does he even feel bad?

It sounds like your mom is trying to advocate for you, even if she is going overboard. You don't seem to be standing up for yourself. You are spending too much energy on your mom right now, and not your husband.  "
Does your husband often go out of his way to humiliate or embarrass you she  he's drunk?
"Jeez, yeah. If this guy doesn't feel the same way, that poor girl is definitely crushing on him. What an unfortunate situation."
"You're feeling conflicted because ""everything has been great"" so far, but what you're missing is that it hasn't been. You just think it has because she's been deceiving you. Your opinion of the relationship is built on lies, and now the reality doesn't match your opinion, hence the cognitive dissonance.

Maybe she's planning on leaving you for him soon? Maybe she's keeping him around as a backup? Maybe she just likes the attention and knows it would stop if she had a bf? We could theorize on exactly why all day, but in the end it doesn't really matter. It all comes back to this - **she doesn't want this guy to know you exist**.

&gt; she might not have been ready to be exclusive at the time but that she loves me more than anything now.

Bullshit - you don't just magically fall more in love with your bf the day you get caught cheating. If this were actually true, she would have stopped on her own a while ago.

&gt; I know she is no longer talking to this guy, or any other guys, and I know that their communications slowed and then stopped soon after our original discussion.

Oh boy. You know nothing of the sort. All you know is that she stopped talking to him where you can see it. I'll never understand this attitude of ""she has proved herself to be totally untrustworthy, but I trust her because she says she loves me.""

If you stay with this girl, all you're doing is teaching her that she can disrespect your relationship as she pleases, and misrepresent herself as single for male attention. If you're cool with that, by all means stay. But if you have a little self respect, you'll bail. "
"&gt; even if OP and her bf weren't dating and were just roommates, it's still reasonable

it's amazing what people will let a boyfriend/girlfriend get away with that they wouldn't allow from a friend... just because someone sees you naked doesn't mean they get a free pass to treat you like shit. but somehow a lot of people think it does."
If you have an abortion...you didn't. Tell him nothing. You miscarried and how dare he accuse you of anything else. That is your story. Stick to it. 
You break up with her so she can find someone that's actually attracted to her. Staying with someone bc you don't want to be alone is selfish.

Okay that girl is a mean person.  I know a good handful of asian women who have had long term asian bf and fwb who were well endowed.
"A joking tone and actual joking intention are two different things. The way it reads to me, he had the first one but not the second."
"From the sound of it they have sex once every 4 days. That's still essentially twice a week.

This whole posts essentially screams ""I need therapy"", but I don't know if OP is in a culture where it's acceptable, in a position to even get some (is a migrant), or will realize that she's getting massively upset, depressed and hysteric over what seem like some very minor issues.

This is a recipe for disaster, I don't think anyone on here is qualified to help out with this. "
"Reddit really wants to see you hire your brother, not retire him. I can't think of a worse gift to a 25 year old male than stripping him of all ambition. Your girlfriend seems somewhat insensitive towards your mother, but that's to be expected from ""that"" culture. There are no greater sources of contention in relationships than money and family. If you feel the gulf is too wide consider other options. "

"&gt; I definitely think it's an extreme invasion of privacy to have cameras filming someone all day and night in every room in the house they're staying in without telling them.

She wasn't staying there. She was *taking care of the cat*... eg, come in, feed it, clean the litter box, and leave.

That is not implicit permission either to sleep over, and especially not to bring in a stranger and have sexy fun times in every single room. 

The parents had absolutely zero obligation to inform their daughter of the cameras. She had an obligation *not* to take advantage of access to their home for using it for sexual adventures. 

There is harm done, and that is that people can be reasonably disgusted by other people having sex on their furniture. She violated her parent's home and personal space by doing so.

"If she's suffering from depression then of course a financial planner visit didn't help her ""get it"" because that's not what a financial planner's expertise is in.

"It's not abnormal enough to make you this uncomfortable. I creep EVERYONE on instagram. People I love, people I hate, people I don't know, celebrities, everyone. I can't scroll through instagram without clicking on someone's profile that I haven't creeped in a while and looking through it. So yeah, I'd say it's pretty normal. I'd also say that men typically post less on social media than women in my experience, so going back 3 years might not have been much of a time commitment. It's also a totally normal thing to do to lightly make fun of your friends (I see people commenting on their friends embarrassing old facebook posts to bring them back to the top of the news feed daily), or it's possible that she was mentioning him to another friend who doesn't know him and that friend asked to see pictures, which brought her to his page. All of these are totally normal, harmless, friendly reasons she would've been on his insta profile. Liking one picture of a close friend is not something you should be upset about, and your description of yourself as less attractive, less smart, and less funny is clearly the problem in your relationship."

"The idea of a ""real"" name is misguided. People change their name. Try telling a woman who got married 40 years ago and changed her name that she's not using her ""real"" name and see how that goes down.

"Her story doesn't jive with the deleted texts you found evidence of. If this guy really did assault her, then why didn't she go to the police or tell you at the time? 

Personally, I think that you have no reason to ever trust this girl again. If she is telling the truth, then that means she doesn't trust you enough (after 2 years in a relationship) to have your back if she was sexually assaulted. On the other hand, she may be lying. Either way, I don't see any reason to have any trust in this woman ever again. "

This. He's saying he's guilty because that's easier than admitting he still has feelings. 
"Hidden deep in comments, the truth is revealed.

I too have a coworker who just refuses to admit he is wrong, ever, over the TINIEST issues.  He spent an entire lunch hour arguing with me that the turn into work was on flat road, and that there was no incline that made visibility difficult.  I grant that i should have dropped it sooner, but every time i tried he continued and i rose to the bait.

But dealing with these people in real life is, as you say, completely infuriating.  Some times you can walk away and disengage, but some times you get drawn in and when you ponder it, you get more and more irritated.

Hopefully OP can just take a deep breath and move on, but i don't fault her at all for falling into the trap.  That's just human nature."
"I don't see how it's controlling or bullying to break up with you.  She was serious about breaking up, it's not like she was pretending about it in order to manipulate you.


I don't think being friendly with an ex is a big problem, although for many people it seems to be a deal breaker.  My husband has an ex that he still hears from now and then, and it doesn't bother me at all.  I would say they are on friendly terms and keep in touch now and then.  If he described it as ""I really loved her more than any other woman I dated and we are still friends"" then I might be more worried.


It seems to me that your gf could have at least talked to you about this.  Maybe there would have been a reasonable compromise.  It's too bad she didn't have enough confidence in the relationship to at least have a discussion about it.  But it's still her choice to break up if that's what she decided to do.  I'm afraid the solution is for you to get on with your life."
"Your daughter must come first in whatever you decide to do. Personally myself and my ex do not spend time together with our son. However I see him every weekend and twice in the week. On the flip side I know people who do go out and do stuff with their ex and their kid and get on fine. (I don't necessarily agree that's always best but who am I to judge).

What I will say is that if your ex annoys you so much that you're likely to start arguing while you're out then that's not good for your daughter, but only you know how you'll react to spending time with your ex."
"Approaching a difficult friend directly can often get good results. This isn't one of those times. I've met many people like Vera, and they're mercurial. If OP were to confront Vera and ""give it to her straight,"" Vera will twist it that OP is attacking her for no reason.

If OP asks other people how they feel about Vera, she might find that other people also dislike Vera's behaviour but (like her) are too afraid to come forward about it. "

"A few years ago, I saved a cat from the shelter through a rescue group  because I felt bad for him and he was going to be put down.  DH was LIVID. I honestly thought he would just ""get over it"". I was mistaken. That poor cat really didn't cause much trouble,  and hid most of the time,  but my husband was so resentful that I just brought him in without us choosing as a couple that he would never accept that cat. I ended up having to beg rescue groups until a foster agreed to take him in. It was awful and we fought over it. I am lucky the woman who agreed to take him was so nice. I would never do that to my husband or another pet ever again. I don't think you should let yours off the hook either. "
"You need to stay away from controlling guys, not guys from cities. "
"Your best bet would be to go to couples counseling together. In the meantime, I'll tell you something a couples therapist taught me. Give it a shot, it can really help. 

This is called the ""dialog of intimacy"". I know it sounds lame, but it really works. If you google it, you'll find a lot of resources. 

Practice this a few times with some non-threatening issues before you use it when you're really upset. And make it a habit of calling time out and taking a break whenever anybody is really triggered - everybody has an emotional threshold where they can't see the other person's point of view anymore and there's no point trying until you both calm down.  

The dialog is about feelings only. One person gets to be the speaker, the one who talks about their feelings. The other person gets to be listener, the one who hears the other person's feelings without argument or contradiction, and validates their feelings as best they can. 

So choose who is who first, and then the speaker starts by saying what they're feeling. Feelings are: I'm hurt; I'm angry; I'm sad; I'm frustrated. ""I feel like you're an asshole"" is not a feeling. ""I feel like you don't care"" is kind of close, but ""I feel uncared for"" is the right way to express it. The speaker can say, ""I was hurt and angry when you slammed the door,"" but they shouldn't say, ""you were wrong to slam the door, that pissed me off."" The speaker's job is to express their feelings.

The listener's job is to make the speaker feel heard. When the speaker says they're hurt, the listener says, ""I see you're hurt, I can only imagine how hurtful that is."" When the speaker says, ""you were wrong to slam the door, that pissed me off"", the listener does their best not to feel accused and tries to guide the speaker back to feelings by saying, ""how did that feel when I slammed the door?"", EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T SLAM THE DOOR ON PURPOSE. The listener's job is the hardest, because they need to do their best to listen for the feelings in what the speaker says and react to that, not the accusations. If it gets too difficult, which it will, call time out. 

Don't try to do the dialog for more than a few minutes. Take a break afterwards, enough time to gather thoughts, then trade roles and do it again. 

The point is to take care of each other's feelings. When you debate facts and plans, that's fine, but when you have feelings about that stuff it gets really difficult to deal with the facts. So this process deals with the feelings, first and foremost. After that, facts are easy. 

Good luck.

"You don't get it. They are using you to cut costs. That's it. You said earlier that she is really self centered, but means well. No she does not mean well. People like that add, ""the means well spiel"", to the end of their atrocious behavior trying to manipulate their audience."
"And especially as a teenager who is not willingly going to therapy, I would suggest letting her talk to 2 or 3 therapists and pick the one she wants to see. the ""false choice"" technique might make her like the one she chooses more."
"Except they're speaking as if nothing was wrong/the baby had no reason to cry. The baby had a soiled diaper, hence why they continued to cry (and eventually become a more intense crying). When a baby cries for more than a few minutes, it's safe to say something is up more than them wanting attention. 

OPs husband ignored the crying and *turned off the monitor.* Then continued to ignore when the cries where heard across the house. He was probably more concerned with his own sleep than being a father for long enough to change a diaper which is a *really* bad habit  to get into. "
"As much as I cringed reading some of that, you need to say your actually uncomfortable with this stuff. Dodging around how you truly feel about it isn't going to help you. You are too worried about letting her have her own life and not trying to ""own"" her. 

I'm not saying just go and tell her what to do, I'm saying tell her how you really feel about this guy, that it does make you this anxious or uncomfortable and that you would rather her not spend time with him outside of work, especially with her saying she afraid of getting feelings for this guy. 

Let's go through the list of things you mentioned, and what it seems like objectively. 

&gt;whenever some new guy starts at her job, they start giving her goo-goo eyes day one.

This happened to you as well did it not, you guys met at a place you both worked and hit it off rather quickly. 

The difference is now, she's paying attention to one of the guys that is hitting on her, this hasn't happened since she met you I'm willing to bet. 

&gt;Still, she’s feeling pretty lonely right now

Loneliness among women is way up there for reasons behind cheating. Just look at this sub and you'll see at least one thread a day where some guy got cheated on because his SO was lonely, and the guy wasn't giving her the same attention as this new guy.


She self admittedly has being growing feelings for this guy, and you have basically supported it, and said its cool as long as you don't bang him. You realize you basically told her to have an emotional affair with this guy, and it's cool with you. Like what are you expecting out of that, her to get to know him better a no longer have feelings for him. 

What about this guy, is he pursing her and trying to break you guys up so he can date her. I would assume so, based on the way you describe it, what else would he be doing trying to make friends with a pretty girl and nothing else. Not normal behaviour for most guys and you know that as well. 

Then there is this
&gt;“Hey, before you go, I wanna ask something. I don’t want to bring up our talk last night and scratch the fresh wound so soon, but I was wondering if you’d be okay with me going for a walk with &lt;The Other Guy&gt; tomorrow to take his dogs out. 100% as friends, in the light of day and in public with two huge dogs.”

A few things with this she asked just before you got off the phone, despite her already having made the plans. So she knowingly asked you this at time where she knew you wouldn't really be able to argue you about it. Considering she even mentions she doesn't want to bring up a fresh wound so quickly, but then does so anyways. She knew it was a topic of discomfort so she brought it up at the last possible second to in a by the way type thing. This somewhat forces your hand to agree, or start a late night argument. 

Now she's made a choice here, she knows full well at this point she could develop feelings for this guy that will jeopardize your relationship. Yet she still made the choice to hangout with him anyways. 

&gt;“Don’t be nervous. I’m trying to be friends with him, not more, and you have my word on that. I love you &lt;hearts&gt;”

This line bothers me, first off these types of things usually start as friends then something more. Moreover it's seems she's trying to reassure herself as much as you that she won't get feelings for this guy.

Even if she's going into this with 100% innocent intentions there is no way that guy has innocent intentions I would bet every cent I have on that. Also what happens as people get to know each other, cannot be controlled even with innocent intentions she could find herself falling for this guy. 

Furthermore the way they met is very similar to how you met her, and if you weren't dating already would she end up dating this guy if she was single when they met? If the answer to that is yes you know how big of a threat this is to your relationship.  "

"&gt; Am I a chump for being cool about this situation with her?

Yep. A massive, giant, huge chump. 

She dumped you so she could fuck a new guy. She fucked the new guy. Then she came back to you because she knew you'd take her back with open arms. 

You're the back-up plan. She wanted to bang this new guy, so she dumped you with the sole purpose of banging him ""guilt free"". 

Find someone who will make you their first choice, not their X choice once they've exhausted all other options. "
"&gt; It's possible he'd been planning the proposal for a while? Rather than putting together some last minute proposal

It sounds more like a ""last minute proposal"" than something planned though. OP doesn't give a lot of details, but she does say that he asked her ""one night after work."" That doesn't sound like it was a special occasion that required a lot of elaborate planning that he didn't want derailed. "
"&gt;My relationship with their mother is separate from my relationship with them.

That's not how families work. The relationship between parents, whether it is harmonious, acrimonious or non-existent does have an impact on the children from that relationship. For you to pretend otherwise is simply untrue, and a way for you to minimise your actions. 

You don't get to decide if your affair affected your daughters; clearly it did. Seeing your parent, the person who raised you and taught you to be who you are as a liar and a cheater can have a profound effect on people."
Heck I bet BF's post would barely mention the pushy friend and focus on how GF bailed after making a mess of the bedroom 
"One thing...
You say K didn't abuse you because she never touched you.  But there are SO MANY more types of abuse than physical.  It sounds like you were a victim of verbal and emotional abuse, which are as much abusive as physical abuse. K knew that if she physically touched you, she'd be fired and possibly arrested, but she could say whatever she wanted and the kid fresh out of college would take it.

I'm glad that your support system is actually supporting you!  Everyone that's not an asshole will be on your side if the other person punches you, but in the case of verbal/emotional abuse, it's a lot easier for others to try to minimize or justify the abuse.

Finally, do NOT feel guilty about ""smearing"" her to S.  You gave a factual account of how K treated you.  That's not smearing.  That's telling the truth.  If there are ever negative repercussions for K, that is entirely K's fault.  She chose to abuse her reports.

And an aside, you told S about K, S said she'd never tolerate that kind of behavior, but K still has her job.  WTF?!?"

Is your housing in both yours and Jonathan's name?  If so, you're going to have to pay all the rent for the remainder of these lease.  You could later file in small claims court for his half but if Jonathan doesn't have money, you won't get repaid.  So, you need to figure out how to pay without him. 

Also, Jonathan has rights to return to the place you shared.  If it's in just your name, you need to give him legal notice to vacate.  If it's in both your names, you might contact the landlord to see if anything can be done to remove Jonathon from the lease.

Like other people said, cut your losses while you can. He's not doing shit because you put up with it *and* financially support him regardless of what he does or doesn't do. He's a leech and he knows it. So ditch him next time he tells you you're too good for him, because *you are*.

I mean he's basically saying that you know you aren't hot enough to act up. I'd be pissed off too. 
"I definitely think there's a difference between calling your partner the ""most beautiful in the world"" and simply just ""beautiful."" I would never tell my SO that he'd definitely land a modeling gig just by walking into GQ's office, but I do tell him he's handsome _to me_ which is the complete truth.

I think wanting your partner to see you in that kind of light (beautiful and handsome) really isn't asking that much tbh. There's such an emotional aspect tied to those adjectives too that it's not just about physical appearance. 

Then again, I could never call my ex-boyfriend ""handsome or gorgeous"" just ""cute,"" but that was mostly because I could never get the words out because _I just wasn't that into him_. 

""Cute"" was just the easiest, least-committal umbrella term for some kind of physical attraction. So idk."

Second, if Sally was truly confident that she had any leverage to get her old position back, she probably wouldn't have contacted you asking you to demote yourself. Instead, she strikes me as the type of person who would have gone directly to your boss in the first place.

Finally, in the off chance that your boss actually entertains Sally's request, I'd encourage you to schedule a consult with an employment law attorney."

This is going to be a problem in *any* conversation.  Not just when you're trying to ask girls out.  It's not playing games; it's learning to talk to women like you'd talk to guys, and not special rare unicorns.

Guys who are able to converse normally with women are going to win, yes.  They're also going to do better in business than someone who converses poorly, they're going to have more friends, they're going to be given more chances/opportunities... 

Your post history is GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS HOW TO GET A GIRL.  In fact, your last post just a few days ago outlined how obsessed you've been over them.   With this post, though, there's some clarity -

You're not having trouble with girls, you're having trouble interacting with *everyone*.  And it's all been starting since... you started getting over being high every day.

Going back to weed is not the answer.  You can't spend your life high.  You have to focus on interactions without being on something."

"Okay so I know this is really upsetting and brings up feeling really embarrassed.  You've gotten attached to him and it's hard to think about not having that connection with him anymore.  I just wanted to reassure you that *you did nothing wrong*.  People develop feelings for their therapists *all the time*, it's not just a thing, it's a damn cliche.  That wasn't really the issue.  The issue was that, in all likelihood, he developed feelings for you, and realized that he would not be able to maintain the professional distance from you that optimal care requires.  His feelings are called countertransference, you can google it if you want.

So all this is to say that what happened is normal and common and nothing to be ashamed of.  Him referring you doesn't mean that you're wrong or bad or did anything shameful.  He's just trying to protect you and your care and to look out for your best interests.  I hope this helps, OP.

"I moved to a new city last year and spent a while feeling like this. I've always considered myself an introvert, but I realized I was feeling much, MUCH better when I spent time out with friends...I think simply because I was spending so much time alone, I craved at least some degree of human interaction. Which is pretty much a need for all people. I'd definitely suggest getting out and doing more social stuff. Here's some stuff I tried:

- **Meetup:** didn't make any actual friends from this, but it did get me out of the house and helped with the loneliness.

- **Bumble:** this app has a friend feature that you can use to find your ""BFF"". Actually met one of my really good friends here.

- **Tinder:** went on some dates; nothing serious came from it but again, it got me out of the house and I've made some good connections from it

- **Facebook groups:** I joined a hiking group and made some great friends through that

- **Friends of friends:** I've made some great friends through friends

Do you ever hang out with your co-workers or acquaintances? If possible, I would probably start there, as the friends of friends thing usually gives you the most opportunity to meet a lot of new people and expand your social circle.

Also sometimes just getting out of the house and being around strangers can help. For example, go read in a coffee shop instead of on your couch. "

Unfortunately what has happened is that *you have moved past it*. You are finally seeing him for who he really is and no longer standing for it. You are moving on from the emotional hold he has had over you the last thirty years.

For some, this step can take another 20-30 years, for me it happened when I was 15. The bottom line is, you stop seeing the ""father"" label, and instead see the reality:
&gt; for the last 10 years he's been a very shitty person. Anytime I think about talking to him I think to myself why go through it again, he will find another way to hurt me.

In other words, you're moving on, and are finally leaving this shitty person behind. Your life is about to get a lot less stressful, trust me, which will leave more room for you to grow (and focus on your marriage)."

Ok, so after reading the entire post, the impression I have of you is that of a passive aggressive person who wants people to read their mind because ""otherwise do they really know me?"" Of course, I don't know you personally so I can't tell what you're like but this is what your reaction makes you seem like to me.   
  
Of course, as a married couple it is normal to give gifts to each other on a special occassion like birthdays. But you said that all you really need is her and, yes, it did mislead her. She can't read your mind. If she asks, it means she wants to know exactly what you want and work towards somehow attaining that. You can't just say ""I just want you"" then get upset, and have a full on fight because she did **exactly** what you said you wanted.  
  
It really sounds like she wants to make it up to you, but with the current constraints on her (vacation, family visits, money situation) makes ""at this moment"" not ideal for her. But she's willing to do it when you get home. Getting into a fight with her then going down to sleep on the couch is a no-no and makes things way worse.     
  
""Even after you have a fight, at least say I love you and good night."" Is something my girlfriend told me after we had a fight and kissed me goodnight.  I learned from her that problems like this are temporary. Your SO is your best friend and that can last until the day you die. Of course there are exceptions but this seems like a miscommunication that turned into a bigger problem.  
  
You mentioned work and sex. I think these are bigger issues to you than you make it out to be in your post. Think about those two subjects when it comes to your wife. How did you react? Now why did you react that way? Think about issues that you know of and write the contributions that both you and your wife add to the issue. And then ask your wife to do the same on her end and set a date to talk about them together.   
  
It is important that I used the word contribution instead of blame. Do not turn things into a frustrating game of whodunnit because it will just lead to both parties going on offense/defense mode. It's not about whose fault it is, it's about how do to take this problem apart and deal with it better next time. Try to open it up for discussion like this:  

1. Address an issue 
2. This is how I feel about the issue
3. This is what I think you contribute to the problem 
4. **And** this is what I think I contribute to the problem  
5. How do you feel about this?  
6. What can **we** do about this? 
  
Encourage her to discuss in the same manner as well. It is difficult but it works unless one or both don't really care. And in marriage, both need to care and work towards having a good relationship. That ""spark"" that acts as a crutch early on in a relationship eventually disappears. That's when you need to start choosing. If you really think it's worth it, then choose her. Choose her every day.

"I agree that he has a strange idea of what constitutes love.

It doesn't really matter that he thinks you're insecure or that you like getting compliments (who doesn't?!). What matters is that he is aware that one of your needs isn't being met and he isn't doing anything to fix it. He doesn't have to agree with your feelings, he just has to care enough to acknowledge them and respond appropriately. That's what a loving partner does."

"not all families are the same. you're putting expectations on her based on your own family, which is unfair. 

there's nothing wrong with wanting space, especially after a fight. if she prefers to be independent and likes her own space, while you want to be up her ass as much as possible, then obviously there's a compatibility issue. there's nothing wrong with wanting to up your significant other's ass, but if she likes having her own space and you want to be with her, you're going to have to work it out by discussing it with her.

it's a bit much to move in together after a year and whatever time together at 19. don't pressure her into moving in with you if that's something she doesn't want to do. you're already out on her own, but she isn't, and if she isn't ready then she isn't. that doesn't mean she doesn't want to move your relationship forward. you don't have to rush it."

"The boyfriend could have said, ""Babe, I think you are GORGEOUS. But, it doesn't matter if you don't believe it"". He avoided complimenting her. The. Entire. Time.  And never says it otherwise. She's right to feel upset and question it. Of course we must be confident, strong individuals blah blah blah but we all have sad days, and wanting to know you're attractive to your SO is a very normal thing to want and he isn't communicating that he feels that way to her.

"Her not wanting to raise a fourth kid is different from her not wanting to give her sister a second kid.

I think you're seeing it like she declined pregnancy for you but accepted pregnancy for her sister.  But surrogate pregnancy is different from pregnancy followed by parenting.  Maybe she was turning down parenting a fourth child.  In which case the sister's request is different from your request, and you should not compare them as directly as you have been.

Separately, it seems like maybe there is an issue where she is willing to pretty brazenly dismiss your perspective and so you censor yourself to avoid a scenario where she dismisses you.

As to your marriage, I'm not sure why the pregnancy itself is worth divorce.  I think the real problem is something like the broken dynamic between the two of you, and the pregnancy is just one sign.  Maybe you need to confront the dynamic, not the pregnancy.  If the two of you cannot learn a process to come to mutual agreement on major issues, like kids and surrogacy, then your lives may not be compatible."

"You're going to get a wall of responses from people who skimmed over your post telling you to dump him, so prepare for that.

Read up on codeine addiction and withdrawal so you know where your husband is at and what you should expect.

Get couples counselling for yourself and drug counselling for your husband. This is above the pay grade of people here, I can tell you now that only a very tiny minority of replies will be from people who are professionally licensed to treat addiction.

Don't beat yourself up about ignoring the problem. It's the easiest and simplest thing to do with high functioning addicts, so there's no point blaming yourself so far. But getting admitted into emergency via an OD means that your husband isn't so high functioning any more. What you need to do is recognise that you've drawn a line in the sand regarding his behaviour in the here and now, and into the future. The past is the past, you can't change that. Hopefully it's a huge wake-up call for him, as well, and you can both work together to make your relationship stronger."

"I think the only part of this that really needs to be dealt with is that Erin put your roommate in the middle of the drama by making her the one that would have to inform you that you're not invited to the birthday gathering. That was a shitty thing to do to your roommate when the issue is between you &amp; Erin. If you get on well with your roommate, I would maybe tell her that you're sorry she was put in the middle of the situation. But I think any attempts to address things directly with Erin will just fuel the drama instead of resolving it. "

"I'm going to be blunt...to me, it sounds like you're throwing a tantrum because you aren't getting your way. You say you ""don't think"" you could love her and ""it would"" feel like she was a different person. Most people wait for the love to actually die before shouting divorce. If this was months after she had given birth and you came here saying you resented her for her decision and were thinking about divorce I would absolutely tell you your feelings are valid and encourage you to do as you feel necessary. But these are hypothetical feelings that make it seem like you are just getting revenge for not getting your way. "
"tbh this feeling is really normal and expected. like when you have abusive parents a part of you, even if subconscious, still clings to the idea that if you succeed and do perfectly somehow you'll gain their approval and they'll change. he won't change, and you don't owe him anything."
"You'll never get over it. My ex faked an assault, after verbally and physically abusing me. She went to the cops, I got arrested, had to defend myself in court even though I was out of state with physical proof when the alleged assault happened. 

I got charged with a misdemeanor, had to defend myself and then after getting the charges amended to disorderly conduct (even though not a damn thing happened), I had to wait seven years to get it removed from my record. 

No fire department would hire me with assault charges on my record regardless of amendments. I finally ended up working part time(where I still am) and it's 80% what I always wanted. 

At my age now, and with some of of the injuries I've ended up with, my chances for starting over in an urban department are zero. 

If I were you, I'd still go after her for charges, and consider a civil lawsuit. Even after everything is done, I can't forgive her, I never will. She ruined my career opportunities. 

I've been separated for 12+ years from her and if she got hit by a bus tomorrow it wouldn't bother me in the least.... I'd probably throw a party.

Funny story out of the whole thing though... the same DA and detectives that Shanghaied Brendan Dassey(making a murderer)were the same shitbags that fucked me over. 

I'm not saying he isn't guilty BTW... but... if you watched that, you'll have a rough idea how I still ended up with charges even though I had a solid alibi and the cop that took the report got fired for falsifying other reports. 

TL;DR ... you need to end this, talk with the cops about charges, divorce her, cease contact, block her number/social media accounts and move away. 

Life sucks right now, but, it's going to get waaaaay worse if you stay. Whatever you do, don't drown yourself in booze to cope. "
"I completely understand why you feel this way. Unfortunately, he has demonstrated that it IS in his character. He has presented himself as someone trustworthy to you, and now that he's shown you what he's capable of you want to give him the benefit of the doubt, or assume he has made a mistake, because that's much better than seeing that he actually is a creep. Everyone is a million different people, we are different at home, at work, by ourselves, etc. He has shown you a side of him that is scary, and disgusting. You can't go back to not knowing that side of him, what you can do is protect yourself and take steps to ensure that he does not harass you again. Tell HR, or tell your boss. Nip this in the bud before it gets worse. You may not believe he is capable of worse, but I bet a week ago you didn't think he was capable of this. Stop talking to him, screenshot the texts, and take it to HR. I know it's scary, but I really believe you owe it to yourself. You do not deserve his harassment."

"I want to add this:

&gt;Strangulation is sometimes fatal. According to a large U.S. case control study, prior strangulation is a substantial and unique predictor of attempted and completed homicide of women by a male intimate partner.

Please reach out to a counselor or therapist - posts from people in your situation are common and that seems to be the most helpful thing that people can do.

"&gt; First, did he actually tell you how much he makes (eg, did he lie to you that he made only 20k) or are you just assuming that, because he is frugal, he doesn't make a lot? 

In one of op's comments, she says that he has turned down things because ""he can't afford it."" I don't think he ever lied saying he only makes 20k, but he has lied. Saying he can't afford certain things + being frugal with everyday expenses means he was purposely misleading her about his actual income."

"Look up ""desire smuggling"".

The best way to express what you want is to use your words.  Unfortunately women have been conditioned to feel like that's inappropriate/blunt/selfish, but the truth is, it's so much kinder to your partner to say what you want.  

You don't need to scan the calendar's next three months to three years and pinpoint the perfect time to say it.  You don't need to wait until you've found the magical perfect combination of words that will make it seem like you're not advocating for anything.  You don't need to cross your fingers and hope he reads your mind.  You don't need to act somber until you've coaxed him into verbalizing it for you.  Please don't do any of that.  That's for kids who want a new kitten.

Just say it.

It will be hard at first, so make it easier on yourself by telling him, ""I'm going to try to get better about advocating for what I want.""  He will be relieved!  Then next time you want to tell him what you want, you can go back to that.  ""So remember how I said I was going to work on advocating for myself?  I want to do that now.""  Eventually you won't need that excuse, you will just be able to do it.   

Good luck."

"Yes, OP: You NEED to discuss with your girlfriend what she would choose to do if she did get pregnant.

"I definitely see your point - in my personal sense, a sex scene is very different from outright role playing sex. For example, the difference between a fade-to-black PG13 and an NC-17. 


Plus I see a writing group as collaborative, as in, ""What do you think about phrasing it this or that way?""  Whereas role play is active, as in, ""I do this or that *to you*."" 


Those are the crucial differences that push it into infidelity to me, personally at least. "
"I would say that you need to get out of this marriage. What is your husband contributing? It sounds like he is a parasite. I don't see how you can get past the cheating incident, but ultimately that decision is up to you. 

In case you do want out: 

**Step One** is read your lease. Let's say the original term was 1 or 2 years. If you stayed put, it may be month by month now. If the lease does not specify what happens, then it will be up to what landlord tenant law is in your area. You can try asking your landlord what the procedure is for moving out. If they say you have to give 30 days notice, submit that immediately. You may be able to get put in one month, or by the end of July. 

**Step Two**. Tomorrow, of possible, take the papers you were served (though I'm not sure that leaving divorce papers on the nightstand constitutes proper service, but I guess that's another topic you can bring up), along with current statements of all bank accounts, debts, and investment accounts, as well as a rough write up of your monthly budget, to a family lawyer. 

Some lawyers offer free consults; many charge up to $250. Get recommendations from any divorced friends, as well as any friends who work in the legal field, at the courthouse, or in law enforcement. If you cam swing it, get at least 2 or 3 consults. 

Because there is a child involved, and because you may end up having to pay alimony, you need a lawyer. This is a case where this is the best money you can spend. 

The next logistical steps depend on how fast you can get out of your lease and what the lawyer says. So my **Step Three** is more about how to approach the next few months: 

* Get any valuables out of the house. 

* Do not fight or disparage your husband in front of your child, ever. If you need to vent, that's what friends and therapists are for. 

* To that end, counseling for yourself and your child. 

* Explain to your child in an age appropriate manner what is happening. The therapist can help with this. 

* Anything unpleasant and factual you need to inform him about is to be done through your lawyer. If he tries to start an argument, tell him to talk to your lawyer, and then stop responding. Do not engage AT ALL. Go to another room, leave the house, put in noise cancelling headphones, go into another room and shut the door whatever you need to do. 

* Be a Gray Rock in day to day interactions. Look it up. 

* Follow any advice given by your lawyer, and any court orders, to the letter. 

* Much as you may be tempted to do something spiteful or vengeful, don't. You are not going to teach him a lesson. If he were going to learn anything, he would have already. 

* Get your daughter involved in as many positive activities as possible. "
" You can't guarantee she won't find out. She likely will. If she does, that will be a way harder convo than telling her how important this is to you and asking her to open the relationship. 

Do you think cheaters mean to get caught? They don't. They get sloppy and overestimate their own abilities to keep things on the downlow.

What if you and your wife go out to eat as the other woman is there? Busted. Or if you're out with the other woman and you butt dial your wife? Busted. Or if the other woman finds out about your wife and decides she needs to know what you're up to?

It's your life, do what you want. But the loving thing to do, and what I'd want done if I were your wife, is for you to have a  honest convo with her about how you feel and how this is effecting you. You don't have to say you're considering cheating, just tell her that it means so much to you that you want to open the relationship. 

Who knows, maybe she'll agree and then you won't have to feel guilty. Or maybe she'll realize how much this means to you and will be willing to explore options to get herself more into sex.

Maybe part of you is turned on by this secret sex thing. It will blow up in your face sooner or later. It will change who you are as a person, from someone whose honest and faithful, to someone who cares more about their sexual needs than they do about their relationship with the mother of their children. "
"&gt; no custody agreement... which yes, you will tell me to get, but I realllllly don't think it's a priority right now

But it is, because all this bullshit is a direct result of not having a custody agreement. The point of custody is to determine what is in the childrens' best interests. By having this nebulous situation, you are making it much harder for your kids to rely on a routine, which they need to feel safe.

Get a custody arrangement ASAP. It IS the number one priority if you want your kids to grow up feeling some sense of security."

"&gt;  if she didn't have to split her love between two people

Love's not finite. It doesn't get split. Did you have to split your love when you had a second and then a third child?"
"My boyfriend is like yours to a degree - he believes that he should pay for everything. However, like you, that makes me uncomfortable. Eventually we came to a decision that whoever suggested the outing (i.e. you want to go to this bar tonight or he wants to go to that restaurant tomorrow) pays or we split if we both want to do something or one of us wants to help out the other. 

Your boyfriend is pretty extreme though. I agree with everyone else, have you straight up told him that you feel disrespected? Because this is way beyond being a gentleman."
"No, you're morally opposed to this and have made your views clear. He in turn won't respect what you're saying and continues to bring it up and guilt you into changing your mind. I strongly suspect he knew when getting the puppy (maybe the friends put it in his head) that this would be a side benefit of getting the puppy, but he knew better than to be upfront with you about it at that point.

If you care that strongly, and aren't willing to put your dog through that and take the responsibility of caring for and selling puppies (good dog breeders have literally YEARS if not DECADES of experience with a breed which, as 22-year-olds, you likely do not), pay to have her spayed as soon as she's old enough. 

Tell him one final time you will not agree to this, it wasn't what you decided together when getting the dog so you aren't obliged to accommodate this desire of his now that you have the darn thing. Tell him he NEEDS to can it with the whole topic because it is making you look at him differently. If he can't do it, well you have a new situation on your hands of a manipulative, controlling BF who won't take no for an answer. "

"If he wanted her when she was a young teen, that's pretty suspicious. Waiting until she's 18 was probably more for his own safety than it was about not being able to desire her until she was an adult. "
"Seriously. People have had their children abducted and murdered. They have become paralysed, watched their husbands and boys leave for wars they would surely never return from. If people can move on with life after these tragedies you can dump your shitty arse, cheating boyfriend.

Former parrot owner here.. You're not going to win this one. My suggestion would be to try tackling the behavioral issues together or just leave. 
"Yeah, I think that's valid - if she's only planning vacations with him and never planning solo trips with you, that's concerning regardless of the gender and should be discussed.

I don't get the two boyfriends thing, I think because it sounds much more like she has a best friend and a boyfriend.  If he were a woman I think you'd see him as a close best friend and not a girlfriend without the physical aspect.  

Did this not bother you when you started dating?  Why didn't you break things off if you have a problem with it?"
"But she's not just trying to cut contact with an ex-FWB. This is her husband's best friend, which she knew going in. Of course she'd be unhappy that it didn't go how she wanted, but she kind of just has to deal with it. Open relationships like this require maturity and honest, open communication. "
Yes there are emails.
"You shouldn't get involved. Your kids are adults, your mother treated them poorly. She needs to take responsibility for her actions and work to improve the relationships herself. If she harasses you about it, explain that to her. "
"&gt;I started crying and now we’re questioning whether I should even stay in touch with him anymore

No. No is the unambiguous answer to that question. 

If you let your child around this man, you are exposing them to abuse, and if you keep contact, exposing yourself and your husband.

&gt; ""which just reminds him that I don't want to be normal, and that my child wouldn't be normal either with me as a mom"". 

If you wouldn't say this to your child, don't ever let them be around someone who could.

He's the one that is broken and crazy. I can't imagine being so cruel to my child. You shouldn't have to accept that as part of any relationship. Your husband is right. You do what's right for your family. Not your abuser.


&gt;In addition, if we cut him off, then my mom will be hurt as well.

Are those hurt feelings​ more important that your child's mental health and happiness? Your husband's? Your's? Would you tell your child to keep being abused to avoid upsetting someone else's feelings? Then look after your family the way you want your child looked after, and that includes you.


&gt;Right now, I don’t know how to handle him, and how safe I’ll feel, emotionally and mentally, to have my child around him, regardless of if my baby is hearing or not. Please help, Reddit. I’m honestly a little afraid for the future, right now. 

You've been taking the pain and suffering for the sake of maintaining a relationship with an abusive parent. You'd should​n't have to, but I understand. But now that pain isn't just on you. Your family needs to come first, which is your husband and child, not him. And they CANNOT be safe and happy if he's around to tear you down or even worse, your child.

There's no compromise or middle ground. A promise by him to not say anything doesn't mean squat. Don't let your child even know about family who thinks they, or you, are broken and wrong. Protect them from abuse, by protecting yourself.

"It seems small but it's super weird he is concerned about the 3k credit card bill. It's not *that much* money to pay off in the grand scheme of things so it really makes me wonder if he is already in the clear.

People ask for prenups before marriage is a thing, postnups are shady AF. So I doubt he'd risk it until he felt he was in the clear."
"&gt; Bottom line, I don't know how to handle this situation.

Bottom line, you guys have shitty communication. You have some other issues going on, but with shitty communication nothing can get resolved. 

Research couples counselling, get some names. Have a chat with her about going, to help you understand each other better and work through your problems together. "
"I know this is going to come off very rude... but... I guess I'm not really sure why you're with someone you have such disdain and criticism for? He is not into the same things you are, and maybe he's still figuring out what he wants in life - that doesn't make you better than him. Why should he have to engage in volunteering if he doesn't want to? I think it's strange for you to be obsessing about that. You've filled this post with all sorts of nonsensical irrelevant details about how great your life is and how active you are. Do you think it's fair to hold others at the same standard?"
I just had a buddy dating a 21 year old woman who refused to use any form of protection and hadn't had a test done. She at least had the sense to get tested and get an IUD when he finally pulled his head out of his ass and insisted. This is bizarre behavior on her part.

"I don't want to sound insensitive but that sounds pretty constrained.  I'm not sure how to express this thought, but she probably enjoys getting a taste of going with boys when she goes out with you, and I bet seeing that freaks out your family.  It might be easier for them to suggest there's a sexual relationship between you than to admit your aunt has a (natural, healthy) curiosity about men and the wider world.

"Stop cuddling with him. Cut back on all the physical contact. You need to stop treating him like a surrogate bf, it isn't healthy for either of you. He came out as gay, so he probably isn't attracted to you or interested in your romantically. You need to accept that. If you want to save the friendship, you need to put in place more boundaries to protect yourself and treat each other like friends. "

"What happens when you try to demand an answer?  I know ""demand"" can have a pretty negative and forceful connotation, but something more like ""Sweetie, I need you to quit playing around for a second and just tell me X.""  It sounds like you're a serious person, which is not too far off from my personality, so you might be missing the point that she is trying to be playful.  Just way too often.  I mean, ""Guess"" or ""Do me a favor and I'll tell you."" both sound very flirty to me which would be pretty nice...just not all the time.  I'd try to push a bit more often to get that direct answer and talk to her about you both finding some balance on this stuff.  She needs to maybe dial back the playfulness every second of the day, and maybe you need to exhale a bit more and realize she is just trying to be flirty with you."
"I feel like I'm someone who can take a joke, but it was incessant.

Two maybe. But, it was getting into large numbers and just put-down after put-down is too much. "

"Yup. Had that happen to me when I was very young and naive, and struggling with poor self esteem. I reacted by doubling my efforts to impress the guys, but I didn't trust or like them. If I did understand it was negging, I didn't speak up against it as I was afraid to appear not fun. Had that happen in my late 20s, saw it for what it was, was repulsed, called it out, cut the date short, and refused to see the guys again."
"&gt;Bought me louboutins for my first birthday before we were even official

Jesus...

&gt;bought me jimmy choos for our first Christmas

Holy shit.

&gt;paid and suprised me with a trip away hiking staying in a fancy hotel when we'd been together a month

Why would he do that?!

&gt;a trip to a beautiful little lodge when we'd been together 3 months &amp; then Disneyland Paris when we'd only been together 5 months &amp; then the Maldives when we'd been together 8 months

What the actual fuck?!

&gt;I was upset when my birthday was over

Why would you be upset?! What possible reason could you have?!

&gt;so he said he'd buy me something or take me away once a month on the 18th and he stuck to this for about a year

Ok, I get it, he's your Sugar Daddy.

&gt;who cared that much about surprising me, being romantic and woo-ing me. 

Buying you is what you mean. He's buying your affection by spending a king's ransom just to be with you.

&gt;now if I wanna go out for dinner I have to decide where and book the table (although he'll usually pay)

God forbid you actually have to decide where to eat and dial a phone.

&gt;if I want a weekend away it's completely up to me to find out where to go and where to stay (though again, he'd pay)

GASP

Ok, the rest is just too rage inducing to comment on. You sound terrible and more high maintenance than a luxury jet. But I have to put some of the blame on him here, he's the one that decided to buy someone's love and set the table for this kind of ""buy me shit or I will get angry"" BS. Hopefully he realizes that spending more money on you is just going to make things worse and runs right out the door. Good luck with reality."
Those clauses disproportionately hit domestic violence victims. It's disgusting. 
"So hang out with everyone separate.  If Erin is more of a ""planner"" than you - expect to be left out of stuff.  You are going to have to make an effort to hang out and do some of your own ""planning"" in a non-passive aggressive way with your friend group.  Don't put them in the middle of anything (like you seem to be starting with your roommate) or you will piss them off.

Sucks OP...but this is fallout from having such a tight knit group (classes/study/socialize/roommates) and then throwing a sexual encounter in the mix too!  

I suggest trying to expand your social circle to people outside your program.

"Came here to suggest this. My brother used to drop his dog off at my house everyday so his and mine could play together while we were at work. When I moved out of state my dog became severely depressed and started experiencing extreme separation anxiety when I'd leave the house. I'd get home from work and is voice would be hoarse from having howled all day long. I got him a playmate a month later and everything changed! Dogs are pack animals, they *need* companionship. "
Hey man could you do me a favor by saving yourself and leaving this relationship forever? Thanks.
"That's good! Just be careful not to have an expectation without actually setting it for him. If he ends up not being home several days of the week, will you honestly be okay with that? If not, you need to decide whether this needs to be a black and white RULE, and not a hope. Otherwise, you will be upset that he's not respecting your feelings, and he will feel like he has to be home but can't really address it with you. I'm just saying that this statement feels like you're pushing your emotions onto him and expecting him to handle them with no clear instructions. "
I didn't even think of the police getting involved; good point. The Dad got off quite lightly and the OP is trying to push her fiancé even further. 
"Sounds like the script wasn't a pretense to her.  It doesn't sound like she's very interested in you.  How about instead of doing things unspoken, under ""pretense"" that only you seen to feel, just ASK HER ON A DATE.  Then she can say yes or no and not have to deal with you trying to randomly kiss her and making things super akward."
"Yeah, she might not be right for not letting him know she was gonna be out all night ***based solely on the fact that people worry and that's normal**** but ya don't call someone's job man ya just don't. She's not wrong in what she said about him calling her job either. "
At the least your boyfriend is ignorant/ inconsiderate.
I have no issues with her having male friends. I have met a number of her male friends and have interacted nicely with them. I have issues with her spending time alone with an admirer late into the night! 
"I think the answer is both and neither. He seems to have a fundamental problem understanding the nature of your priorities. Your kid is number one, the most he gets is number two.

He needs time to decompress,  I totally get that. That doesn't mean he gets to take it out on you or that you have to drop everything to be his emotional crutch.

And I'm going to be quite frank: He is likely going to have total or partial responsibility for his brother someday. Is he going to be able to care for him 24/7 or oversee that care? Is that something you are prepared to deal with as a partnership? Is that something he's likely to foist upon you?

I say this because I am about 95% likely to have guardianship over my twin brother (Autistic but not independent). While I've never felt like ""I don't have a brother"", it was common sentiment in the sibling circles I was in.  One reason I married the man I did is because he understands that my brother is a priority to me, that we are eventually a package deal. He loves him like I do.

If my husband couldn't handle that, I wouldn't have married him.

If your relationship is serious, and this hasn't been talked about, it needs to happen. And soon."
"Don't give it to your ex.  That would feel super weird to her.  I think you should keep it - IMO, it really wouldn't be strange to give it to a future GF as an engagement ring, or you could remove the stones from it and have them put into a different band/arrangement (if the idea of that doesn't bother you).  It could also be something nice to give to a future daughter if you want kids.

If you really feel weird about this ring, give it to someone else in your family."
"They are absolutely red flags,  and be thankful he's self aware enough to tell you upfront about some of them.  If he's not getting help for these issue then leave,  you staying is just helping him believe people will accept this behavior."

Then I started freelancing. Then I racked up enough of a portfolio and experience to get an actual job. Once I got the first job, I had a lot of employers seeking me out. I am a good communicator and a better saleswoman. There are better developers out there than me, but not hungrier ones.

"If you feel bad don't ask your boyfriend to tell you you look good. Find other things that will make you feel good, some shared activity, listening to your favorite music, read poems, whatever. You won't always have your boyfriend around when you feel bad, don't depend on him for your emotional well-being.

&gt; I started mentioning how bad I felt about my appearance

You felt bad and you wanted attention to feel better. Frankly, acting like this shows a poor handling of your emotions. Generally speaking, when somebody complains about their appearance there is no direct reply that will do any good, it's a lose-lose scenario. Comforting will at best reinforce the immature behavior."

"Turning off the monitor isn't a big deal and to all the people freaking out, no it is not neglect to not run to a kid every time they cry. 

It's more concerning that he yelled at you to fuck off, is that how he often deals with disagreements? Additionally does he often leave a lot of the baby responsibilities to you and try to get out of them? That would also be a bad sign and unfair to you. Parenting needs to be equally shared."

In that case, I recommend you remove any of your father's belongings that truly matter and to which you or your siblings have some legal claim (family photos, etc..).

If you haven't already, you should consider getting a consultation with a probate attorney to make sure your father's belongings are distributed according to his wishes and the law."
"This. I've never had alcohol, just can't stand the taste. People offer me drinks. I politely decline. Occasionally I'll get a champagne glass shoved in my hand for a toast. I awkwardly hold it until I can get rid of it politely.

"Assuming an equal share, yeah, but given that he's been voluntarily jobless for six years, she might be able to press for more custody.

OP talk to your lawyer about what it will take to gain full custody or at least give him limited rights. Document how little he's involved in your kids life (assuming that's true) and anything else they think is relevant."

"I'm a tall girl. Nothing was more annoying than a man who assumed I had hang-ups about height. For me, being tall is just a thing I am, and I saw guys shorter than me as normal a long time ago. I've actually rejected 2 guys taller than me because they made a big deal out of their height and acted like it made them superior to other men. As someone who grew up with tall family members as well as myself, I knew that it didn't contribute in any meaningful way towards making me a better person and is just as silly as claiming blue eyes make someone a better lover.

Agreed.
"There's a /r/relationships aphorism that pops up regularly: ""don't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm."" Even if your husband is mentally ill, the harm he's already done you and will certainly continue to do you if you return is just as real as if he were fully in control of himself. Talk to a lawyer ASAP to sort out what your situation is, with regard to your international marriage and what rights your husband may have to your child."

OP, your husband is a terrible damgerous man.  He is an abuser, full stop.  Your brain has recognized this and can't suppress it anymore.  You need the kind of counseling and assistance that will help you get far far away from him. "
"This just happened. 

What meltdown? Get ahold of what?

"Eh... honestly, this is kind of a crap situation. You've got: 

* a limited amount of time together in person.

* her still living with her 'ex' where she'll be headed back to soon.

* her head is probably not in the best place it could be right now due to the death of her sister and just ending a long relationship.

* long distance is really rough to deal with

If the two of you were younger I'd just recommend enjoying it for what it is for a couple of months then letting it go. That might still be the best advice. 

As you're both adults though, I'll say this. Don't worry about going slow. Take a moment, think through what you want from this. It sounds like a long term relationship is what you're after. You've got two months in person to see if that's a place that's going to work out for you and you've got to make the most of it. It isn't a great idea to pussyfoot around right now when she's leaving back to that messy situation soon. Figure out what you each want within these two months.

So go to her and say something like...

*""Hey... so I've been thinking, and I know I mentioned slowing things down. The truth is though, I do like you quite a bit, and we've got a limited amount of time with each other to see if this is something that can go somewhere. So what if, instead of slowing down, we just roll with it. We talk, we spend time together, and we let what happens, happen without worrying about any of the other worries life has waiting for us. If either of us aren't feeling it at any point, we can just make the call to be friends. If we get to the end of this couple of months and we both want more... then we'll at least have made the most of our time together and can start planning out how we want to make things work. Does that sound fair?""*"
"First, your ex-gf is your ex. You're broken up. You've got to accept that. Blaming the mcat or studying is probably only the surface level issues. You've got rose tinted glasses looking back on your relationship.

That is a separate issue from your friend.

And so it is messed up for your friend to go after your ex, especially when he knows everything about you. You should vocalize your disapproval and disappointment, and then lower your contact while you get over it. Don't lie to yourself or others saying ""It's okay"". Be true to your feelings.

You cannot control other people, but you have control over your reaction."

"Tbh it sounds like your boyfriend is totally frustrated because you're a debbie downer all the time and don't try to act on any of the advice he tries to provide so you can be happier.  It's not his responsibility to make you happy - that's your responsibility.  But I think he's just been trying to help you however he can and it sounds like you keep coming at him with the same downer issues all the time.  It can be a real drag to be with someone who is always being negative and doesn't try to make things better.  To me, it sounds like that's where he's at, and it's an incredibly frustrating place to be. 

I think you need to take a hard look at yourself and ask yourself if you're being a good partner.  Do you just complain at him or do you guys actually have a constructive conversation?  It sounds like the former from your description and if that's the case, I can totally understand why he's feeling drained and kind of over you.  

You need to get therapy ASAP to deal with our depression, regardless of your relationship status.  I think you also need to consider giving more in your relationship rather than just take, take, taking.  From my perspective, OF COURSE your boyfriend is completely exhausted by your relationship - he listens and gives advice and tries to be there for you and you still aren't happy.  You need to deal with your issues so you can be a good partner.  "

"&gt; the only times I've lost weight have been when I've been really internally motivated to do it.

This is so true, OP. When I was fourteen I went from 220lbs to 150lbs (I'm 5'11). I exercised for 2 hours a day and played volleyball for 2 years. Then I experienced a very traumatic event, stopped exercising, started eating way, way more, and regained all of the weight + more. I saw a therapist who specialized in binge-eating and nothing that she said to me helped at all because I wasn't ready to change. 

It has only been a few years and I have yet to lose all of that weight again. My depression is a million times worse now that some days I can't even fathom how I used to be such a huge health nut. It sucks, but I'm trying and I'm making tiny baby steps that are going a long way. I think the taking walks together everyday is a really good idea. I remember when I used to commute to work, I lost 6lbs in a week just from all of the walking that I did between switching trains."

You can certainly be respectful to her, and tell her you are sorry she has chosen to react this way, but that Mia is important to you and you intend to continue the relationship.  But if she continues down this path, she will absolutely push you away and that will be her own doing. 

If she is financially supporting you, you may want to prepare yourself for that to get pulled. "
"""however i still feel that she does"". yeah, screw you.  who do you think you are that YOU know her mind better than she does?    arrogant much? have some respect for her and leave her alone."
"Ugh. Neighbors.

I feel your pain.

I used to be friendly with neighbors. It just seemed like the nice, polite thing to do.

But then I moved next door to Joan.

Joan didn't have an off switch. Or a mute button. Or anything. She just kept talking about anything and everything. Social cues for her to stop meant nothing. Actual requests for her to stop meant nothing. 

It got to the point where we would plan to avoid her as much as possible: 


- If we drove up to the house and we could see her walking her dog near the driveway? We'd keep on driving, circling back to wait until she was safely back inside her house.

- If one of us got trapped with her on the driveway, the other would rescue them ""important phone call, come right now!""

I remember once hearing her talk with a friend/family member/whoever on the driveway (which was next to my bedroom).

I knew at the time that they'd been talking for not-quite 40 minutes (I'd been watching a TV show that ran that long), but I hadn't really been paying attention to the content of what they were saying.

I only really started paying attention when I heard the other woman say to Joan in a louder voice ""Well, I really must be off now, but it was very nice to meet you. Thank you for the directions...""

And I realized that she hadn't been a friend of Joan's after all. She was just someone who'd innocently stopped for directions and been caught in a terrifying trap of social obligation and awkwardness...

We moved away not long after that (for unrelated reasons), but we learned from our mistakes.

We don't know any of our current neighbors. We don't know their names. We barely know their faces. If they say hello, we smile and say hello back, but we keep moving. There is no stopping and talking.

And it's been fantastic. They live their lives. We live our lives. If one of us needs emergency help, we're all willing to step in (that's happened a couple of times in the last few years). But otherwise we're just ships passing in the night.

10/10 Would avoid my neighbors again.

TL;DR You're not alone. Neighbors be crazy. I recommend ignoring her entirely. Do your best to reset the relationship to what it was (nothing). She probably won't let up harassing you for a while, so be prepared to avoid HARD. You don't have to be overtly rude (unless you feel you should), all you have to do is just keep moving. Smile and say hello, but don't stop the forward momentum of your legs until you're safely into your apartment (behind the locked door) or out of the building entirely. Conversations are forbidden, they'll only encourage her. 

You got this."
"Well yeah... like I said, I'm a bit scared of what she's going to do. I've had some less than exemplary neighbors before, but nowhere near this caliber. I mean, I'm legit pretty nervous I'm going to come home to some fucked up stuff some day.  Or wake up to something bad.

I know she likes the drama, especially after how much she emphasized that she didn't last night, and emphasized how she's not crazy, and T is SOO CRAZY WTF IS WRONG WITH HIM. And she even said something last night along the lines of ""I don't know why, but bad shit is going on around here"". Like..  what a creepy, detached thing for her to say, especially since **SHE** is the one stirring up shit. She also even told me she didn't know what PTSD was (when I told her I had it, also regretting that), and talking to me like I made it up. I don't know how one would not know what PTSD is. I'm just starting to feel like this isn't a home but a place where I need to be hypervigilant. And it's upsetting."
"Sounds fake to me.

I'd bet that he made the account just to try to make you feel guilty."

"there was some slight ""I don't believe you"" at first but the screenshots were just too damning. I wasn't going to believe his excuses of ""somebody's using my photos"" or ""I was just on there to make friends"" either. 

Unfortunately it was also an emotionally abusive marriage and I got dragged along for another year before it finally ended. All in all it took about a year and a half for me to separate fully as there's a lot of back and forth that happens to people trying to get out of an abusive situation. It was a sucky situation for my friends and family to be a part of, but they supported me along the way. "
"I understand that one person can work and do most of those things, but the status quo is that he is currently living a life *as if* he was outsourcing all of those chores to other people. His life would be significantly different if he was working *and* taking over all the contributions she makes (either because he'd have to pay for it or because he'd have to lose a lot of free time and take on the stress of doing everything), which is the only way to justify his attitude towards their finances.

"&gt; I didn't do this to hurt her. 

Yes, you did. You wanted to punish her for paying more attention to your child and less attention to you. "
"I have talked to her about this. I asked her, where are we in our relationship, to which she does not give a definitive answer which really pisses me off. I straight up asked her, ""do you not love me anymore? do you want to break up?"" She started crying and replies. she does love me and wants to remain together. After seeing the tears I stop the argument and ""forget about it"" (at least for that night). But deep inside I still feel upset about what she said. "
"Before you said it was negging, I just assumed she was flirting by trying to start playful dialogue and you didn't realize it. I love teasing someone and having them tease me back and it's a key element of flirting w/me. Negging on the other hand is designed to make people feel like shit"
"oy, the kids.  especially if she's limited at all in her interaction with them.  my friend got put onto bed rest at 6 months so i went and stayed with them for 3 months to help take care of their 3 year old since her husband worked a lot.  that kiddo was totally excited about being a big sister but was FURIOUS at me and almost hated me and the baby by the time it was born because her mom couldn't do anything with her.  if, at that point, someone had then said she didn't get to keep the baby she'd have lost it."
And what would an apology effectively do? This man is in his 70s. He's not going to change. Apologies are good but at this point it would take a lot more than that to force this man to control his emotions.

"I'm gonna pull out the biggest cliche in the book here: you can't have your cake and eat it too. If you guys were both interested in polyamory and could go into it together, that's another story. But this guy is just being selfish and wants the comfort/awesomeness of your relationship, while getting strange on the side.

You agreeing to his hall pass offer probably makes him think you're okay with it. Make it very clear to him that you won't use it, and that you honestly aren't 100% okay with this. If he prioritizes his FOMO over your entire relationship, it's time to bonce imo."

"OP, don't be alone with the guy. Don't even talk to him. Go straight to you're superiors with the texts. You don't want this to turn into ""he said she said"", you don't want to give this man a chance to hurt you, and there's nothing left to discuss with him anyway."

"&gt;I still loved her so I was okay with being friends.

That's not how either love or friendship work. 

&gt;basically knows I'm a safe bet but wants to explore her options.

Yup.

Just leave. You're not her friend, you're her spurned ex. Leave her alone with her problems and move on with your life. She's cheated on you, twice, and will again if you're dumb enough to get back with her. She's stringing along this older man because she wants to and because it makes her feel good, and she won't make the hard choices necessary to be in a relationship.

But none of that is your problem. Your problem is that you can't just stay out of her life."
are you serious? this reads as a troll post... if what you said is correct and you really don't understand why then there's no hope for you seriously... 
"You did the right thing.  You treated a business proposition like business.  If they want you to do their makeup, they should reimburse you for all expenses AND compensate you for your time as well.  It would be far cheaper for them to hire someone local.

Move along with your life.  If you never hear from them again, it won't be your loss."
Or load the app onto the cheap phone and leave it at home. Then at least she can have her real phone and take it with her. 
Why even confront her? Who needs the added drama? Take screen shots of all of the texts and hire an attorney to situate it. She's a pedofile and needs to be dealt with accordingly. 
"Seriously. I laughed at that. Literally every friend I've had that's been cheated on, the boyfriend claims he didn't finish."
"Also - double check their STI screening actually included an HSV test (for both type 1 and 2), most don't unless you specifically request it."
"I'm sorry, but what the fuck does this 'handling' and 'being firm' that your father and brother are pushing mean? Because it REALLY sounds like they are openly advocating for abuse, specifically ABUSE AGAINST YOU. And it's straight up evil. It's about control, and it's evil. I'm sorry, OP, but you need these men out of your life. They're trying to hurt you any way they can."
"Yeah, that hurts a lot. Like a lot a lot. But whatever. I have to focus on myself and stay away from them.

I'm not going to attend the wedding and I'm going to go NC for a while."
"And the only children *I* know, are just fine.  
More importantly, statistically, only children are not disadvantaged.  

I'm not close with any of my siblings. I don't have problems with them, but they're just people who were raised in the same house as me. A sibling is not inherently a wonderful thing. I would not miss not having siblings. "
Yeah that email bullshit is yet another example of how immature your bf is. You want a partner in life - love isn't enough. Your bf is not a partner to you. 
"Damn, you got the whole truth into one sentence."
"It sounds as though your uncertainty stems from your own insecurities more than her actions. In all honesty, it doesn't sound like she's really crossed any lines at all. Even when you pile all those situations together, it sounds like totally normal friend stuff. The problem here is you comparing yourself to him at every turn-- let it go. If she wanted to be with him, she wouldn't be with you."
But they're not going to hook up with you if they meet you and aren't attracted to you because if your birthmark. 
"I'm a 35 year old guy, and I'll tell you right now that almost every guy over age 20 or so knows that you just don't hang out with underaged girls (or girls that young in general). And the ones who say they don't know it do, and half of them end up in jail. 

Just the way this appears to outsiders should be enough to deter him from forming a relationship or EVER being in a situation where he's alone with her. It looks bad, and it's risky -- she could make something up and tell people you touched her inappropriately, and you would be done for regardless of whether or not you actually did anything. 

The fact that he is hanging out with her and is obviously getting emotionally close to her tells me that he is extremely attracted to her and is trying to rationalize it to himself, you, and everyone else, at minimum. Whether or not anything physical has happened yet is an open question. My guess would be that something has -- kissing probably, touching, and maybe sex.

Your husband clearly isn't telling you the whole story, as is evidenced by the fact that he got mad at you for interrupting their alone time. 

Something is very fishy here. I don't know what the age of consent is on your state, but it might be worth looking into. "
...But why would you unless you wanted to meet people? It's weird to even still have the app after three years in a relationship 
If the man has recently ejaculated and there is live sperm in his urethra it will be able to be transported into the vagina and survive by the precum and then there is a chance of pregnancy. Precum itself does not contain sperm.
He might also be asking because if he's emotional and words get to him then the argument may make him doubt that you really do love him at that moment because of the argument so he feels you're just saying it to make him feel better but not necessarily mean it. 
"He talks about masturbating with his ex and gets angry when that makes you go quiet?

"&gt; I only mention my physical fitness to clarify that this isn't a situation where I have different standards for her than myself. 

You kind of are? You're asking her to put more effort into her appearance than you are. I'm sure she wouldn't mind if you put on a 6pack either, you know? (and you'd better hope genetics don't kick you when you're older)

&gt;I've also tried to push for both of us to eat more healthy food

You can and should be doing this for yourself, if you're serious about the health aspects, and not just her looks.

&gt;What can I do to help her be more healthy?

There's not much you can do, unless she wants to. The only thing you can do is have a conversation that her weight is important to you. There's no easy way, although it would help *a lot* if you committed to the same level of fitness. Even if she's ok with your weight, eating healthy/exercising is something that will benefit you anyway. and if you're worried about her health, you should be just as worried about yours. Having an on your feet job only goes so far- and having a fast metabolism doesn't make you any healthier.

My only major worry, is that based on your description, it's a very small amount of weight gain. If it only takes that little to throw you off, you're going to have problems. You say you don't expect her to be full on model all the time, but from the indirect comments, it kinda sounds like you do.

edit to match the edit:
Things make a lot more sense after your edit. That's a lot more than just ""a bit of a belly"" situation.

&gt;To clarify, I would guess she has gained between 15 and 25 pounds in the past 5 or 6 months

That's concerning. Do you know what has changed? That isn't a trivial amount you can gain/lose easily in that time frame. That requires a big change in habits or medically. Did she used to go the gym, and just stop? 

This isn't a ""eats an extra bag of chips now that we're together kind of thing"". So i think it's really important to figure out what changed. Even if she let herself go entirely, it'd be hard to match that.

&gt;She has been gaining weight progressively more quickly,

This could go either way. If it's natural, it should plataeu, and there isn't much to worry about. The speed of that gain, however, has me extremely concerned that it isn't.

You also mentioned in the comments she has stretch marks- is there any chance she had an eating disorder or something in the past? Tread carefully."

And while you're at it, you've been with Sarah for about 10 months. I say cut your loses and end the relationship. If she's not going to cut off Jenny, and it doesn't seem likely that she's going to do that, then you're always going to have to pretend to be on good terms with your rapist and that is a horror that should not be experienced by anyone.

"&gt; And I promised my parents I wouldn't mess up like this. 

&gt;I'd be responsible and have a career before getting pregnant. 


Your problem is called ""Brutally Unfair, Cruel, and Unrealistic Expectations"".

Both you and your parents are guilty of foisting them upon you. How dare you be so awful to yourself, that you would villify yourself-- as a totally sexually mature adult-- that you are some how dirty or tainted, irresponsible or a screw up--*lesser*--- for reproducing.

It isn't just natural. **It is a human right.** And millions of people everyday and throughout history have done it just fine in far worse circumstances and far younger ages.

Forget your parents for a second, and straighten out your personal values. Do yourself and society a favor and inject some realism and compassion into your views. "
"You think you're frustrated NOW, just wait.  Because this will be your life.  Look at r/deadbedrooms and see how many stories start with fear.  She needs counseling, probably.  Who put it in her head that it will hurt that bad?  It's uncomfortable, but not painful, at least not for me.  "
Setting boundaries early is important.
"You must ask yourself if you are ready for a life with no sexual intimacy.

She's just postponing. If she wants kids, you'll probably be having sex until the deed is done. Then it's over. If this is not something you want, I suggest addressing your gf serious questions about where your relationship is heading"
Don't feed the troll guys.
"That and/or someone that's just really, really dumb."
"Your family--those who do these things--don't love you back. They love the projection they put onto you and reject the actual person you are. Make no mistake, even if you were in a mixed-sex relationship, disrespecting your choice in partner disrespects *you*. Throw homophobia atop of that and it's just an added layer of bigotry that they choose to paint you with.

Practice asserting yourself:

&gt;""Meet [country] natives and have some exciting fun while you're still young and unattached.""

""I'm not unattached [Family member], I've been dating [Girlfriend] for four years.""

&gt;""cutting ties"" to ""begin a new life.""

""Who do you think I need to cut ties with?"" (Perhaps unsupportive family members...)

""I love my life, I don't need a new one""

&gt;""starting a new family""

Answer either with your actual plans with your girlfriend (childfree? Planning to adopt? Surrogate?) or other-species-family, i.e., ""Oh! [Girlfriend] and I have been thinking of rescuing a dog when I come home :)""

Don't allow them to drape their futures over you, shut down their ideas that have nothing to do with your reality."
"Why can't they maintain their relationships with her?  My dad's parents used to come visit my mom and my step dad every few years when I was growing up.  They came to see me and my brother, but also because they were still fond of my mom.  The idea that someone ""owns"" the right to control other people's relationships by value of being family is kind of sick.  Obviously, some respect is in order--don't invite ex and OP to the same family event, but for separate outings and social media?  "
"Okay, my initial reaction was fight back but after 5 seconds of thought, I'm thinking your sister doesn't understand the internet is forever.  I know too many people whose entire web life has been examined by prospective employers.  If a job involves any kind of government clearance, they will search and find these accounts.  This is putting her future at risk, not to mention any future relationship could go through these posts and decide she is a lunatic.  

You need to keep your distance.  This is a mud slinging fest.  Protect yourself."
"There are a few things going on here and I feel like they're in different categories.

First, for the baby thing. There are different parenting styles and you need to get on the same page, it sounds like. Crying it out is a controversial but an accepted method. 18 months is old enough and it's doubtful going to get him pegged for neglect for it if he's not neglectful in other instances. There are also parents who think that letting them cry it out isn't for the best. 

You should certainly talk about it and agree that if the baby wakes up at 1 am then it's probably for a reason and you should check on them, especially for instances of having a dirty diaper. There's a difference between letting a baby cry it out when they're first going to bed and when a baby wakes up in full on tears in the middle of the night and that's something you two should talk about, research if you have to, and get onto the same page.

Second, it sounds as if you're not really into the marriage. If the only reason that you're in the marriage is that you think you won't get full custody, you should probably start looking into your options. If you're not happy then baby is going to pick up on it and it's better for your daughter in the long run that she's in two houses rather than being with parents who are unhappy.

Talk to an attorney. Whether he's worked with police or not, you'll still have a valid chance. However, you may neither get full custody. Think about the fact that your daughter needs both of you and you might not be so stressed about it."
"&gt; what would have happened if I don't ask for it? They just invite both of us

Yup.  They invite both of you and let you sort it out between you if you can't even be in the same building together, or if you can hang out at the same event without talking to each other.

Since you requested that they not invite both of you, you were the one uninvited.  You were the one that made a big deal out of you and Ex being invited to the same party, so since you're clearly the one with the problem... you get removed.

You cause trouble, he doesn't.  See the picture?

&gt; I acted on a few occasions bitter and snappish towards Susan after the break up... I did apologize for when I was a straight up asshole.

Apologizing for being an asshole doesn't mean that people go back to trusting you not to be an asshole.

So... you raised a stink about your Ex being invited to a party you were also invited to, and you were a jerk to your friends.  Yeah.... I'm not shocked that you've not been getting invited out.

&gt;There was talk of me hosting a garden party this summer and invite Ex to see if we are able to coexist in the same place but to be honest I'm starting to to feel resentful. Why would I invite people to my home who never invite me out? 

This isn't the place to be resentful.  The garden party is a way to show people that you're over being petty and jealous and are ready to be a good friend again.  The party is a big apology and a ""Let's all get along"" to everyone.  

You seriously need to get over your butthurt.  Or you're going to butthurt yourself out of all your friendships."

"Yeah OP, what did this sucker ever do to deserve a better life versus you getting that better life? What makes him so special?"
"Having a healthy sex life in no way precludes me from being able to give advice on mental stability or healthy relationships.


You destroyed his property, attempted to destroy his reputation, and are *still* looking for revenge for no reason. Okay, so you had sex and then didn't want to keep dating you. So what? He told you multiple times your attitude and obsessiveness made him wary of getting into a relationship. When you refused to change your toxic behavior, he did the appropriate thing and stopped spending time with you. You drove him away, and now you want to punish him for leaving. Get help."
"First of all, what's the timeframe for all of this? Your SO is only 18 and not drowning in money quite yet, so presumably things like surgeries and all of that are a distant concern, years out. I would suspect that a young relationship with 18 year olds would fizzle out for other natural reasons long before those changes become a reality. 

All that said, it's admirable that you want to support her through these changes. Relationships get stressed out when there is a lot of change. That is when they become the most difficult. And not only you will be experiencing change, but he/she will too. So there's every chance that for one of you, the change will be too much or alter your perspective on the relationship and *that's ok*.

If you embark on this and it doesn't work, that's ok. You guys are only 18. There's no mistake here that you can't come back from. So if you want to go for it and then later it doesn't work out, that's ok."
"He'd known you a week and a half and cheated on you a few weeks later?  I think he asked you to be exclusive *much* too early and his fuck-up was a consequence of that.  A person is *far* more likely to drunkenly cheat on someone they met a few weeks ago than someone they've dated for months or years, so I wouldn't take it as any indication that he'd ever do it again.  Especially since he told you.  "
"IDK, I've never accidentally fucked a friends partner. "
"She really may not know she smells, people become habituated to the smells they are around a lot - such as their own body stink - and don't notice the smell anymore. "
"At this point in time, all OP knows is that she ""might"" be pregnant for any event that could come up in the next decade.  

If she actually *gets* pregnant, and at a time that is likely to conflict with the wedding, she'll have plenty of notice to let the friend know so friend can make adjustments if needed."
"Yeah I am also baffled by the people calling her an entitled gold digger. She sounds like exactly the opposite of a gold digger.

I'd be pissed if I'd given up a bunch of perfectly reasonable things (like the occasional vacation or dinner with friends) because my SO claimed he couldn't afford it, and then it turns out he was lying the whole time about his situation. He's intentionally manipulating her with guilt to avoid doing things he simply doesn't want to do. 

Maybe OP is different, but I know that if I ask someone to do something and their response is ""I can't afford it"", I feel pretty fucking horrible going and doing it by myself without them. So I'd skip it too, unless it's an extremely important event, in solidarity with my loved one who can't do those things. So yeah, I'd definitely feel robbed of experiences too in her situation, because for me I know if the answer is ""I don't want to"" instead of ""I can't afford it"", I'd shrug and go do my thing without any guilt involved, and maybe re-assess our different life priorities/goals/etc if it happened often enough."
"....yeah, it's still cheating. They at no point had an open relationship, and she is choosing to stay in this marriage despite the complete lack of affection and trust. 

I'm not unsympathetic, OP clearly has zero notion of what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like or that it's okay to divorce when a marriage is beyond repair. Her parents failed her big time. But now that she's an adult, with kids who are internalizing her and her husband's relationship as normal, she has a responsibility to get with the program and end this drama. She wants out, and needs to find a way to make that work, without screwing other people in the meantime. It only complicates things and confuses the kids. "
"That's a very legitimate question and I thought about it for a while. I can only answer for myself, but OP has mentioned a kind of ""student"" lifestyle. After graduating and when you have your first job and things calm down and you're doing well, I can say I'd expect a more ""grown-up"" lifestyle to come with all of that and time. Just a bit more comfortable. Maybe a place with a room more. Maybe not going camping but staying at a hotel (age matters) etc. At least she seems to think they'll stay together (wants to buy a house with him), so I guess she is kind of waiting around for that ""level- up"". 

Now, I know this might be unpopular, but I would find that really insulting to have a partner I pretty much consider family lying to me about that. Had he just said ""hey I got the money, but I don't want to spend it on that"", I can make a decision to buy it on my own. If I have the impression that you don't really have the money, I might be inclined to wait around until you feel more comfortable spending some as you earn more over time. She was just not able to make informed decisions here. And I feel he willingly deceived her in this. I'd be rigorous about that. I'd give (and do financially support my partner) everything for my family. But if someone deceives me because they're afraid they'd have to share with me, that is insulting. You can twist and turn it as you please. But that might also be a cultural thing. I know Americans are rather indipendent. Ah well, thank you for allowing me to think around on this a bit. Interesting. "
"Why can't she be in the wedding party at all? If I was her, I'd find that quite insulting. She could at least be a bridesmaid. 
"
I'm still not really understanding how you want to keep this girl on the DL but get mad that she doesn't pay enough attention to you. 
You want a beautiful woman. Would a beautiful woman want you?
"I do feel a bit trapped. At least she withheld my free will and didn't let me make a well informed choice. I'm trying to be optimistic though. She feels genuinely sorry. Maybe I'm naive but I would like to make it work and I do believe in a ""grow stronger from this"" scenario. I'm not sure that this will be the case, but I believe that growing stronger could happen with the right people."
That doesn't explain why someone gains nothing and the other puts on 20lbs. This isn't metabolism. This is very different eating habits and energy output.

2) Drop girlfriend a line.  Create a fake FB (or something else) profile and message her.  Send a package to her via mail.  Include print-outs of the nudes and all of the information about his fake names/profiles so she knows you're telling the truth and can do additional research herself.  Do not identify yourself, but she deserves to know.  If he's so easily banging you guilt-free, he's probably banging other people too and that improves the chances that he won't know it's you.

3) Make better choices in the future."
"It looks like there were two problems that escalated:

1. You were driving aggressively, which made your boyfriend uncomfortable. (Have you discussed this previously? Is it an ongoing issue? Was it his car that you were driving?)

2. You had different goals for the drive home. (You make a point that he was missing the point of a road trip by staying focused on getting home, but plenty of people just want the drive home from vacation to be efficient. They're tired, &amp; they want to be home. Plus, you were already fighting, so why would he want to extend the drive time? You've now learned you have differing views on this.)

However, the way this escalated is kind of crazy. Neither one of you was able to recognize that tension was building &amp; to address it before it exploded. Plus, your boyfriend was completely unable to self-regulate, &amp; he got to the point of screaming &amp; being physically intimidating / violent. People absolutely get cranky at the end of a vacation, but I would look at the level of his reaction as a red flag. Is this how he always acts when he gets frustrated? Is this going to happen again the next time he gets upset &amp; is unable to calm himself down? "
"That's ammo. That's creating more drama by being rude back - while I'm sure you're trying to frame it as not rude, it's pretty generally accepted that if you walk away mid-conversation or mid-sentence that's considered rude and therefore gives her more to talk about. She can talk to everyone about ""I was talking to OP and she just WALKED AWAY! In the middle of my sentence! Can you believe it?"" But if she goes the professionally detached, polite but not personal excuses to leave, she has nothing to talk about."
"I got pregnant a year ago by someone I was together with. Even though we had been together a while I thought, can I see this man as my loving husband, and raising my child? I realized the answer was no. I saw that the relationship was toxic, and he was manipulative. I got an abortion, and I'm thankful every day for it because I was free to end the relationship and move on. Even if you do keep the baby (which personally I would consider not doing) please don't stay with the father and give him power over you. Best of luck!"

"At the very least, you both should demand financial compensation for the medical bills from her sister."
"I dunno, I think that coming home daily to a pregnant wife who is not having my baby seems like a pretty steep price for me to pay in this setting. "
"why is it ethical for you to have a fourth child when there are so many children who need to be adopted but not ethical for her to act as a surrogate when there are so many children who need to be adopted? I'm genuinely asking.

"&gt; LARP is real-life WoW?

Yeah I guess? You don't have to RP when you play WoW at all. I've never pretended to be anything I'm not while playing, all I did was kill dragons for better loot. Besides, gaming culture has gotten so mainstream nobody cares about making fun of shit like this anymore."
"This is the most high-school thing I've ever read in my life. Holy shit. 

&gt; TL;DR I called a girl attractive, She didn't mention it at all and instead moved on by talking about something else I said.

What, exactly, did you expect to happen when you told her she was attractive?

She'd say ""thx"", you'd say ""ur welcome"" or whatever, and then you'd move on and continue talking. So... you missed receiving a ""thx"" and sending a ""ur welcome"" message. Oh well.

&gt; Is this bad, or should I not be too worried?

There's literally nothing to be worried about. This shouldn't affect anything whatsoever. Continue talking to her and eventually set up plans with her. "
"&gt;I talked to a friend about it and she said that it isn't wrong to ""expect"" marriage after having been together for this long and living together successfully.  
  
I agree with your friend.  It's not like she's been hiding the fact that she wants to get married.  If you really don't want to get married, you should have told her that long ago."
I think people are saying that your assumption that you will be keeping your friend and your wife's friend will be cast out (because your house is the site of group gatherings) is what is confusing people. Why does your wife need to lose this friendship? Why can't they continue getting together separately from these group hangs at your house? 
"I don't agree that the living room girl has a better deal. She presumably has no doors, no real privacy, people tromping in and out of the kitchen, no closets, and no direct access to a bathroom. She should get to pay less for that.

And you're literally wanting to rework your rents over $50/month? That honestly just seems really petty and not worth it to me."
"jeez-just text him-""hey, I thought about what you said and you were right-we should say broken up. When would you like to get your stuff?""

Boom.done.

When someone breaks up with you dont take them back."
"It would be creepier if it were an adult doing it, but a hormone driven 15 year old doesn't think normally and loses a lot of impulse control when hormones take over. It's say it's less creepy and more horniness leading to poor decision making. 


To me the phone is the only really disturbing or annoying one because that's major value. Anything like a shirt, deodorant, or pens are just common things siblings take from one another.


My sisters have at some point taken all of these just because they wanted to. My one sister prefers wearing men's deodorant so she took mine, or a couple of times they wanted to wear my old tee shirt or jersey for a special event. 


Not sure about the phone, could have used it to talk to someone anonymously. Just download an app and message someone, get the info you want, then return the hardware. 


I would say the next time something goes missing just casually ask her if she took it. Normally when I am accusing my sister of taking from me I give them a cop out of ""hey, did you borrow x? I can't find it and I was going to use it/wear it."" 

"
"It's good that you're going into this with your eyes partially open and that it's not something you're willing to run ahead with, because it's just such a weird idea. You said your wife started the divorce process, is there a reason that she hasn't pulled the trigger on it? Does she like the idea of having you around on a string she can pull any time she likes?"
"Ultimately, your hair, your decision. That said, if he only likes your hair a certain way, you can't *make* him like it another way, it just comes down to whether your feelings about your hair are more important than *his* feelings about your hair - IMHO they should be. No-one wants to upset their partner, but you shouldn't be making yourself less happy just to protect his mood. If the relationship is otherwise good, he's an adult and he'll get over it.

But maybe make it clear to him that whatever decision you make, you don't really want to hear negativity about it - it's fine if he doesn't like it as much, but him moaning about your decision repeatedly after the fact is a bit childish."
"You should edit your post to include that, because right now it reads like you didn't tell her about the broken condom until you had to. "
"this is all sorts of troubling OP. This is ABSOLUTELY on you. It's not crazy to use the word ""date,"" it's called communication. I hang out 1 on 1 with female friends all the time. Men and women can be platonic, and expecting her to be in on the situation you've created in your head is kinda fucked up. What do you disagree on? The idea that men and women can be friends? That's ridiculous."
"Hahahahaha. I doubted this could be significantly more awkward than normal but yeah, it kind of is. I'm torn because it's kind of like ""if a tree falls in the forest and no one's around to hear it,"" you know? 

The way you guys feel it's disrespectful I'm sure she's not going to be thrilled to know there were cameras running in the house that she (clearly?) wasn't aware of. It seems like to me the issue is exacerbated by the feeling of being aghast of seeing this side of your daughter, which she rightfully kept private from her parents.

There are a few ways you could go about this. You could be honest and admit you found out from the cameras, apologize for any miscommunication, and make your feelings known about not fucking in your home. I feel like you would need to leave out the part about it being disrespectful because she's likely to be upset about the footage too and IMO it is a fair miscommunication. If it's justified for you to feel disrespected, I think it's justified for her to feel embarrassed and angry. 

You could tiptoe around it and make up some excuse for why you suspected there was some funny business going on in your house and, without revealing that you know, lay down the boundaries for going forward.

You could out of the blue have a conversation about no houseguests when she is house/cat sitting.

You could ask her and see if she admits it, which I'm not sure how that's a productive route but it would put her in the position of seeing why you feel disrespected by her behavior. 

No really good route to go about it honestly, I think the results would roughly be about the same regardless of tact. An awkward situation that can't really be made less awkward. "
"Nope. Your dad sounds like he was a jerk and you don't owe him a relationship. Belittling a child dealing with depression is, in my opinion, one of the worst things a parent can do short of active abuse. 

Your family don't have to get it. Do not let your father back into your life if you don't want to, and if you do, only after he has actually **apologized to you**, not having a relative tell you he wants to ""patch things up"". 

Tell them what you did here ""My father, when I needed him, chose to belittle and insult me. I have no interest in rekindling a relationship with him. Please stop bringing it up.""

If they continue to, leave the conversation.

Also, congratulations on getting healthy! Depression is a bitch to deal with (trust me, I know). 

Did you ever get therapy for your depression or did you just work through it yourself? "
"&gt; he HAS to have wet wipes at all times

Is this the source of your yeast infections?"
"If she had a quickie then I just might agree a bit. If she was 19 I might even slightly chalk it up to some immature defiance. 

But she methodically and with purpose spent hours fucking a stranger in every room. She is 27. 

The sex isn't the problem. It's her intentions behind fucking a stranger calculatedly through out her parents home. It's almost pathological. "
"&gt; She is an adult and can have sex if she wants to

The issue isn't that she's having sex."
I mean they literally started dating when she was 18 and he was 30.  I think the risk is higher when there is an age gap like that and one partner is that young.
"It sounds like neither of you are ready for sex. Please do more research. No couple should be having sex without discussing what you would do in case of a pregnancy. I've have friends become pregnant whIle using condoms and birth control. They were still prepared and my friend had to get an abortion. You guys are ""adults"" yet still need to kowtow to controlling parents so maybe you need to stay celibate like children until you get some more agency of your lives "
"&gt;b) we're really good friends and I don't want to destroy that. c) she's never had sex.

From the sounds of it, you don't really have feelings towards her, you just want to get your dick wet. That's fine and all, but people who are sexually inexperienced can sometimes have a hard time initially differentiating between physical and emotional intimacy. There's a chance she could hook up with you without an emotional attachment, but there's also a chance you could really unintentionally mess with her. Also, there is a very strong likelihood that having sex with a friend will compromise the friendship. Again, not always, but you've already acknowledged that you don't want to destroy that relationship.

Find someone else to bang."
"Wow I'm glad my best friend and I never slept with each other. We always had dinner together in college, just the two of us. And we briefly considered dating, then decided against it. Nice to know that if it has gone even a bit further I wouldn't be able to have him as a friend today if I want a boyfriend. "
"As long as we're using anecdotal evidence, I know two couples that did this and both were divorced in under five years. One didn't even make it to two. Sexual incompatibility was a major driver in both. "
"It's not really that unusual or abnormal though is it? My partner and I always tell each other when we're heading out (and we're not living together yet). It's not anything to do with a lack of trust, it's just nice to know what's going on in each other's lives. I guess it varies depending on your own relationship - personally I don't find it restrictive as it isn't centred on insecurity issues etc. "
Of COURSE a gift is her money. I don't know why you think you have any right to it.

Well there's your problem man! Lol
I am not trying to influence you in one way or another.  I do not have the perspective to give you good advice.  If anything it seems that if the implants are reversible  (that's just what I  got from your post) then at least you would give your child a choice later in life.  What you should not do is let your dad manipulate you into doi g something you don't want to do.  He should respect any choice you make.
I have a pretty good idea of the reasoning behind his actions. My advice was more to turn the statement around on him. 
"The next thing that will happen us that OP will start to ""see""  all this negative stuff with his wife. It's already starting...she's materialistic...she only wants me to complete her picture of a family...she only wants me as a provider.  Which becomes...she's selfish...she's shallow...we have no connection and nothing real in common.

Because his wife has to be at least a little bit terrible to justify the destruction he is about to rain down on her life and his child's life...just to get some strange.

There is a book called ""The Script""  about the things men say and do when they are cheating or gearing up to cheat.  OP is already following it.

"It makes it ten times weirder that she's 20 years older and still acting like a jealous spurned teenage girl! She is inserting herself into your life with the last bargaining chip she has, the poor dogs she abandoned YEARS ago!!! 

Seriously, your bf needs to see how sick this whole thing is, and how unfair it is to ask you to accept it as normal! This is NOT normal, even parents who share custody of ACTUAL human children are responsible financially for the cost of travel to see them, and expected to pay half of all medical/care expenses, or they don't get visitation at all! These are dogs were talking about! You need to stand your ground and draw a line, and if your bf doesn't respect it, that means he doesn't respect you, or value your feelings..."
"Just to be clear- just because his actions are fueled by insecurity, doesn't make them any less messed up. It's unacceptable to yell at someone for crying. It's also unacceptable and actually abusive to accuse her of going behind his back out of nowhere like that and trying to control whether she visits him in the hospital or not. I don't care if my boyfriend literally cheated on me with someone; if they're in the hospital LITERALLY DYING he gets to visit them, end of story.

OP, seriously, don't walk, RUN away from this guy. This is not ""second chances"" behavior."
"&gt; She didn't elect to do this, she elected OP to do it. 

Yes because OP is the one changing her name to SIL's name not vice versa and she is doing it first!

There are many potential compromises here but OP seems to be pigheadedly dismissing them all.

"Hi child free person here. I have met two women that id be happily married to if we just didnt disagree on the child issue.

"She may have always thought that, but now that she is pregnant the reality of the situation is that she can honestly and truly feel that it is a live child that already exists inside her right now.  When you're pregnant, the hormones have a way of taking hold to make the child real in your mind and body.  I understand why you don't understand that.  I understand why she didn't use to understand that.  To me, this fact is why I don't think many women get abortions lightly or without due consideration.  It's hard.  That fetus is grabbing hold of the reigns and might as well be shouting out ""hey, I'm here, love me take care of me!"" via internal channels.  If your wife is effected by that, please try not to see it as a betrayal or even a change of mind. Her body has been taken over through no fault of her own, and now this child is as real to her as a baby in your arms would be to you.  Imagine holding a baby in your arms, nurturing it for weeks on your own.  The baby is real, it is there.  Now, imagine someone comes by and says ""ok, time to kill that baby now, no big deal yeah?""

Ok, I'm not saying she should keep the baby.  At all.  I'm not giving you any particular advice other than trying to give you a starting point for empathy for how REAL this shit just got for your wife.

Edit to say: by the way, I'm pro-choice too.  However, I have always thought that it is a difficult choice, and that we as a society should judge ourselves based on how many women have to go through what is (for some of them) a difficult choice and a potentially excruciating process.  We should judge ourselves on whether we did enough to make sure that woman had access to effective birth control, whether she was protected from abuse and exploitation.  I am not pro-abortion, in that I think that the burden of having abortions falls disproportionally on some demographics of women, and I don't think it was always an easy choice for them.  I also want to make sure that we don't see the availability of abortion as a reason not to provide social services for pregnant women, babies, and children.  (Which is a sad direction that being pro-abortion can go.) I feel like people can sometimes abdicate our responsibilities as a society by brushing off abortions as the easy solution, when real societal change to prevent women from being in that position in the first place is what is needed.  My position on that is informed by how hard I think it is for some women to have to get an abortion, even when they believe that it is the right choice.  It sounds to me like you discounted or maybe just never knew about this aspect of it, nor did your wife know about it.  If you had known how excruciating the choice to get an abortion can be, would you have done anything different?  Would you have, perhaps, gotten a vasectomy earlier instead of having your wife be the only one on long-term high-reliability birth control?  I feel like knowing this and acknowledging the difficulty of this decision is important, both in individual relationships and for forming policy decisions."

Idk if this is just about Pokémon it could be but growing up for me and some friends we always wondered about those ""mystery hours"" when parents would make us go to sleep and what occurred. Showing him it's the same boring crap may actually help and stop him from asking to stay up in the future.

"Ask your husband to run any big changes in routine by you before bringing it up to the kids. Conversely you should also do the same.

I wouldn't let my sick kid stay up late either. Sleep is so important to help combat illness. Adequate sleep can help keep people from getting sick and even lessen the symptoms and duration of illness in some cases. Any parent knows a sick kid is no fun. And a sick, tired kid is as fun as a kick in the face.

Does you husband have to deal with them after his fun dad stuff? Like when they wake up at night because they are over-tired? Or the next day when they are a whining crying mess. Maybe let him experience some of the consequences.  

Ocassional staying up is fine but there are definitly consequences. We had 3 things last week that kept my 4 yo up past bed time. Normally we might get 1 later bedtime a week. By the third day-after he was a mess. Crying because he had to brush his teeth. Crying because I put the toothpaste on. Crying because he I made him go to the bathroom. Crying because a fly landed on him. Crying because he had applesauce at lunch. Etc etc etc Sometimes the next day you question whether the fun the night before was even worth it. Since we parents are suckers we do it again anyhow."

It seems to me that while Marcia's good qualities are inherent to her, the problems you are having in the relationship are not necessarily inherent to her; rather, you are very reactive in terms of how you relate to her, and some of that reactivity is manifesting itself very negatively, for you and the relationship.

Samuel Hoffenstein, in his wonderful *Poems in Praise of Practically Nothing*, wrote:

&gt;Wherever I go,

&gt;*I* go, too;

&gt;And spoil everything.

It seems to me that it might be too bad for you to break up with Marcia, only later to find out that the real problem was within you, and that you took it with you to your next relationship and your next one and your next one.  I think given what you've described, that there is a chance that, because you are both young and both working on yourselves, that you might do a little personal growth together and work your way past some of these problems.

I think, furthermore, that maybe it might be wise to back-burner the breakup idea until you've had 7 or 8 sessions in with your new therapist, so your therapist knows you,  and you have had a chance to run your thoughts by him or her."

"Millions of couples who cohabitate first end up getting married. Are there guys who string along women with the promise that they'll get married ""someday"" and then never do? Yes, of course, but those same dudes will also waste years of a woman's time if they're not cohabitating too, because they *don't want to get married at all*. A woman insisting on marriage before living together isn't going to magically change their mind. 

Besides, most people want to get married to a partner who *actually* wants to marry them, not someone who agrees to marry them because it's the only way they can get what they want, so they might as well jump through the silly little hoop the woman is putting up. "

Tell them that while you love them and want to continue seeing them, their constant negativity surrounding political issues is making it extremely hard for you to enjoy your time together. Tell them that they can believe what they want, but you need them to keep it to themselves when around you or else you'll have to cut back on how often you visit each other.

Why on Earth do you feel like it's your job to be ""primary bread winner"" and support him financially while he pretends to follow his dreams. Even if he wasn't screwing around wasting time its a bit questionable that you've taken on this role and that he has let you. You guys are not married or in a super long term relationship with a commitment so why are you letting him take advantage of you put your life and needs and wants last? You should not have to be putting in more hours at a soul crushing job that prevents you from attending college just so this user can sit on his ass watching YouTube.

 Why isn't he busting his ass so you can go to school? ( Answer: Because it's not his job to) also he clearly isn't the kind of partner that would do that for you, even if you guys were in a long term committed relationship. 

Even if he wasn't wasting this opportunity I think you really need to question how you got yourself into this situation and why. He feels like he can take advantage of you when it comes to house work and maintenance because he sees that you are already willing to shoulder all of his other adult responsabilités. You are only 22, you need to live your own life and develop yourself. Im sorry if this sounds a bit rude or judgemental, that's not how I mean to come off but lets get real... You're way too young and not established enough to be putting your life on hold in order to let this lazy bum persue his dreams. Let's get real this guy wouldn't return the favor and support you in the same way you've been supporting him so why do you continue? What if he leaves you in a year after you've spent all of your time and money paying his way? Please ask yourself What are you getting out of this arrangement (other than not being alone, which would be far better at this point)?

I know all of this sounds harsh but this situation and your willingness to put yourself last is really really worrying. That can be a dangerous way to go through life. I know it's cliche to recommend therepy on this subreddit but I really think that you should consider going to individual therapy to work through your feelings and motives. You're young and this won't be your last relationship so take this as an opportunity to learn from your mistakes and grow as a person. It might be worth looking into buying out your lease or maybe if you find someone who wants to rent it the landlord or apartment manager will work with you to have them take over your lease. Good luck with everything."

"Don't push this. She's the one who knows how she feels, not you. It's very presumptuous for you to think otherwise just because you want to pursue someone who is not in the right headspace for a relationship with you, or possibly with anyone."
"You mentioned Stephanie being treated as the golden child. Do you feel you have been furthering this dynamic as well?

Thomas and Stephanie are adults. Expecting your parent to intervene and be the middleman when they can handle their own affairs is immature of both of them. It's OK if they don't like each other, but they should also realize for family functions they can either be civil or not go... If this is happening at your house I would tell all of them separately ""if anyone is being disrespectful to other family, you will be told to leave."" 

I think the cards between them will fall how they will and you won't have much influence over that. Either they'll let the bad blood keep them apart or they'll find a compromise to stay together, but if Thomas just lets his wife shit talk his sister, that's Thomas's issue as well. You can basically treat them as a unit at this point since they're married. So I think handle your relationships with them separately (Thomas/Emily vs. Stephanie) and don't pick sides. Respect your son's wife, but also respect your daughter and if she is being insulted in front of family someone needs to stick up for her. If she wants to stay in Germany and never come back, I don't think you can stop her.

Just as a note: my brother was the goldenchild and I was the scapegoat. But I blame my mom more for how that turned out than my brother - I still have a good relationship with my brother. I don't think being the golden child warrants having your family hate you. I think you should be honest with yourself about how much you reinforced any golden child dynamic here, and make it a point going forward to treat your children more equitably. Don't let either child get away with being disrespectful towards the other, even if Stephanie's insults are ""more clever."""
"There's definitely something fishy going on here, and I'm totally gonna sidetrack here because this thread has made me curious. I just turned 18 and I've been involved in volunteering and my community college for years, as a result, a lot of my closest friends are 20-40 yr olds. That said, I'm very often mistaken for being older, told I'm mature a lot, etc. But still, I'm now really self aware and curious--is that that weird and out of the question?"
"Anyone who has an attitude issue in a 5min game of RL needs to chill out and get an attitude check. Also blaming your team is classic in games like that.

There's always someone who wants to play devil's advocate. You did the right thing. 
I agree that these are being unreasonable.
"I also took a year off after I graduated high school, and my parents established some rules for me that I felt were extremely beneficial for my success as an adult in the ""real world"". 

* I owed them rent every month. It was far cheaper than renting on my own, BUT it taught me how to pay bills and pay them on time. My parents charged me $300 a month, flat rate (so all utilities and stuff were included). It got me used to the concept of bills. 
* I had to do my own laundry for the most part and I wasn't allowed to let dishes pile up in my room or be gross. Your rules about cleanliness here are fine it looks like. 
* Your idea for sharing household chores is a good one as well and will teach your kid how to share that responsibility with roommates in the future or just teach him how to maintain his household if he lives alone. 

Your other rules seem reasonable (EDIT: besides the family time rules, as I commented in a different part of the thread) and it's good that you're teaching him how to be responsible and respectful. I highly highly recommend charging the cheap rent, though (at least until he's back in school). You can save the money in secret and give it to him later if you want but I think this 100% helped me understand the concept of bills and I cannot stress it enough.

"&gt;Because I don't think I could love her if she keeps it.

And what if you could? What have you lost then?

You base too much of your life on hypotheticals, dude. What if she has the baby and you realize, ""shit, I *do* still love the mother of my child!""? Do you think she'll take you back, after you abandoned her in pregnancy?

You might resent her forever. You might not. For your own sake, you should see the pregnancy and the baby through infancy. If you still resent her that much when this child is here, *then* get a divorce. Don't throw your life away before you've had a chance to live it."

"Perspective: I don't know what you were looking for to be honest. You should have ended it after he said ""Take Care"". That's him ending the conversation. 

You went off on him when he gave you the news (which he probably could have handled better) and probably hasn't forgiven you or doesn't want to and has decided to move on...since he is moving to Italy after all. I hope this doesn't sound mean, I don't intend it to be, but why would he want to see you? It's been 3 months, he's moving to another country (I'm assuming you're in the US, sorry if you're not) far away...this is probably the best decision for him in his view.

You're using this to make yourself feel better, it sounds like, and not fully taking in to consideration that may not be best for him.

Sometimes you don't get to be friends with your ex. I know I'm friends with very few. Actually, only one. No contact is no contact. Keep on living your life, it sucks sometimes not having that person there, I know that too well (would love to talk to an ex but it just won't happen and will not make anything better in my opinion, things can't go back to be the same).

Also, I looked at your submitted post history because this seemed oddly familiar...holy shit. Move on. Six years and he dropped you like nothing. Time to stand up for yourself and find someone who you aren't on and off again for six years. That sounds healthy... "
"Holy shit, it's *that* guy!  Ugh. He's only gotten worse. I really hope she leaves him.  :("
"For clarity, this is a dig at him:

It doesn't matter if you are the most mature 22 year old in the world, a 31 year old should be at a pretty different place in life, and is likely very immature if he's dating a 22 year old.  That means you can expect immature reactions, like giving you the silent treatment for four days."
"Gaslighting, more than meets the eye."
He wishes that he had a girlfriend/ was with her instead. Pretty clear cut actually.
"You can be happy about the change and still feel betrayed that she made a life-changing decision without you. It sounds like she maybe also purposefully hid it, if she didn't mention this or her going away party before the wedding. I'd be very wary of how she'll handle decision making in the future. 

I'd communicate how unacceptable this was  and insist on counseling."
"&gt; If you would ask me if I would date a pansexual (or bisexual) girl I would definetly say no. [...] Dont get me wrong or anything, i have nothing against bisexuals or pansexuals. 

Clearly you **do** have something ""against"" these people if you won't date one.  Claiming to tolerate some group only if you aren't forced to be aware of them isn't tolerance, it's apartheit.  Compare ""I would never date a mexican"", or ""Asians aren't my cup of tea"".

She was telling you part of her identity, in the expectation that you would accept it and that your relationship would evolve with better understanding.  If you don't, you have a responsibility to tell her that so she can find someone more compatible."
"&gt; I've never heard of someone escalating an argument over the opinion of which side of the family a kid looks like.

"All of this, and especially the fact that OP said that he'd be really bothered if she started following a bunch of muscular, scantily clad men on social media! Ridiculous double standards on top of being disrespectful. "

"r/legaladvice would probably help you more with this situation.

"Most of my wife's coworkers are pregnant and only talk about how wrecked their bodies are. The ones who have had children describe in vivid detail being ripped ""hole to hole."" It's condoms for us all the way, because aside from not wanting children, it's her body and if she doesn't want that to happen I respect that. "
"""He keeps asking if we can continue meeting up “in secret” and complains about how he has to make excuses so his girlfriend didn’t know he was here.""

Seriously read some of the many cheating stories on this sub and other cheating sites. Your story is utterly text book affair seduction. The emotional bonding over complaining about respective partners( just joking around or not), the innapropriate conversations, innuendo and physical contact. And the final piece can you keep secrets from your boyfriend? You do realize what he plans on both of you keeping secret from your boyfriend so this is a test in progress. You keep this secret then as far as he's concerned its you giving the greenlight for a bigger secret to come. Tell your boyfriend all of it now, hell just have him read your post it should be abundantly clear to him what's happenning here.

There will be repercussions over this that's for sure. But if this comes out later or from any other source than you after Steven's next ""secret"" visit then it will be far, far worse. For example Steven's girlfriend finds out about his secret visits and exposes them to your boyfriend. How would you explain to him that you chose to continue these secret vists by a guy, his brother or not that is clearly trying to sleep with you. You wont look naive at that stage. You'll look fully complicit in all of it so tell him all of it now without ommiting anything espescially to save feelings."

"Every time they bring it up, give them paperwork on how they can sign up for your state's foster care program, or something along those lines. Otherwise, refuse to engage and shut them down, leave, etc."

"Youre making a lot of assumptions. You read they have different parenting styles and assumed he was spoiling her.

Also, i dont agree that she obeys him more just because hes there less. Spoiling a child makes them act out more against the spoiling parent, not less. They can get away with more with a spoiling parent so they push the boundries more. With a disciplinarian the child knows there will always be consequences and doesnt act out as much. The wife is probably disagreeing with how much OP disciplines their daughter, not how much he spoils her."

"Who said that the car would be hers, and not a shared car? If he doesn't want a new shared car, he doesn't have to buy it. But her simply asking if he would want to go 50/50 on a new car is not her wanting him to buy her a new car.

No idea how op and her boyfriend think, but some people would want to have a newer shared car. Their cars may be fine for day-to-day use, but may not be the best for traveling long distances. Or if one of their cars does have some issues, having a spare for when the others need to go in the shop could be useful if they could both afford it and wanted it. He didn't though, so it doesn't matter."
"This X1000. I dated a guy who said all of his ex-girlfriends had cheated on him... Turns out that he believes even coming home 20 mins later than normal is evidence of cheating. He would accuse me of cheating on him if I rode in an elevator with a guy. I now think that most of his ex-girlfriends were probably innocent. It took me two years to get out of this relationship and I only wish I had left sooner. OP, dump this guy. It only gets worse"
"As some have suggested as well you can also find a way to obtain the rent amount in the clear rather than through her email. I think there are many occasions that your rent would come up in discussion, like say you were talking to the landlord or building manager or another tenant and mentioned the steep rise in rent this year and wondering why it went up so high. This would inevitably lead to a discussion of the rent amount, which would lead to the original conclusion that she is stealing from you, yick. "
"&gt;they aren't ""bad"" pics but with the way bikinis are now, you can certainly see more butt cheek than maybe older people are comfortable with.

Look, stop trying to play this into more than it is. Did he word it wrong? Oh, yeah, no kidding. But someone reported you. That report is being taken seriously. 

If you want to make it in the real world, now would be the time to start taking these things seriously. 

You could report him, but what good will that do? He's highly respected and he's right.

You say it as if they knew she was fucking strange men on their kitchen table and purposefully recorded it for shits and giggles.  You are not at fault for catching someone doing something they shouldn't be doing with security cameras in your own home."
"If you're utterly dead set on never having a second child at all ever I'm of the opinion you should do it despite her objections (but not without her knowledge) but at the same time you've got to be aware what kind of damage that could do to your marriage.

Has she said why she's changed her mind?"
"Have her get an IUD like Mirena if you're both unsure. You can resume sex normally as soon as it's inserted, no issues with hormones, and an only 1% chance of pregnancy. Plus it dramatically reduces her monthly menstrual flow. The IUD can be removed at any time (for a fee) or you can keep it in for the full 5yrs and then revisit talk of a second baby.

Go to therapy for unresolved childhood issues like some others suggested.

Ideally, if she were to get pregnant again, she should wait at least a year to give her body time to recover. In the meantime you can remind her that baby #1 deserves all of your time and attention before sharing with a sibling. That'll give you at least 6 more months to push baby talks back or a few more years if she agrees to the Mirena.

I have two kids (ages 3 and 1) and it is very very hard caring for two children. If I wasn't so keen to have my two kids quickly and then return to my career I would have ideally spaced them out 4-5yrs apart so that the oldest could be in school and the youngest could have more one on one attention. It is extremely tiresome running back and forth between the two. For example, my youngest goes to bed at 1am and my oldest wakes at 6am."
It's cool. She says they have been buddies and probably just congratulated him. Take a drop breath. Its okay to have friends of the opposite sex. 
Just keep in mind that silent treatments are a form of mental abuse. 
"I've never been married, so I'm obviously not an expert.

But marriage allows you to be both financially and legally a ""family."" This has benefits beyond just the social things other comments have said. You can use each other's medical insurance (especially useful if one of you is ever unemployed or underemployed), you can get insurance together and have each other as beneficiaries, you can more easily start joint accounts (I once tried to join my ex's gym and couldn't get the discounted family plan because we weren't married). It has definite tax benefits, not to mention other financial and legal benefits if you ever have children together. Medical benefits (not only visitation rights, but other things important for next-of-kin rights). The list goes on.

I'd recommend googling marriage benefits for whatever state you live in. The government will have an official website detailing all the actual benefits, including a page for civil unions and domestic partnerships, so you can better see it all laid out."
"&gt;  If she thinks you're being too needy she should tell you that, not just shut down entirely.

Nailed it. She's basically just ignoring your feelings, OP, hoping that you won't keep bringing it up. If she has a problem with your requests/feels your being too needy, she needs to actually communicate with you instead of pretending everything's fine."
You should end things and probably cut contact.  This is rapidly going places you do not want things to go and trying to continue a FWB situation knowing this stuff would be insane.  Both of you need this to end.
"With the errands, he really means it's easier and faster for *him*. Next time he says it's easier or faster for you to do it, remind him that it's actually not easier or faster for you, or, ""It's okay, I can wait and do the dishes while you go to the store.""

Or start with making a rule: If he can't even get his ass up to see what he needs you to pick up from the store by the time you leave work, then he will have to go out to get those things himself.

"The smell could also be the result of the hormone therapy. I don't know this for sure, but it's just a guess.

But yeah, I'm also wondering the relevance of mentioning she is transgender. If you're worried that she will interpret this as discrimination based on sexual orientation, then it would definitely be better coming from you than the boss. If you're worried that she already feels ""different"" and may be mortified that she is getting made fun of yet again, my guess is that she will likely want to be treated as a human being and have you be honest with her.

Nonetheless, you may want to approach it from a place of concern. Like, ""I've noticed some differences in your appearance these days, is everything okay?"""
"It's not as if you're having sex by accident, dude. You need to break up with your girlfriend ND get help."

"Absent a broader pattern or other factors, it's not abusive to use ""I love you"" to soothe someone or yourself during a painful conversation.

Somebody might not like it, somebody might prefer you not do it, but I think it's highly dependent on the purpose and the situation.

This is a great example of why communication in relationships is so important. I'd go as far to say it is wrong and bad to decide whether doing this is right or wrong before talking to your partner about it. Context is so important, and taking away that context is a bigger deal than the issue in the first place.

That tack is to appear loving but be subtly or overtly racist to his own grandchildren. It sounds like something a person would never do, but plenty of people have experienced it."
"That's unfair. That's not something anyone signs up for at the beginning and staying in a relationship because your partner is taking care of abused kids and you're worried about how it sounds when you break up, is incredibly short sighted.

None of this changes the fact, however, that this harm and damage is 100% *his* doing.

There is no way this is an isolated incident, and I'm sure that he didn't go from zero sexual harassment to... whatever the fuck that was over night at the age of 47. He has almost certainly had *plenty* of chances to notice this destructive aspect of his behavior and try to fix before he crossed the line and fucked up his family, and he failed to address any of them.

I'm sorry, OP.  I've never had this long of a relationship so I can only imagine how much this hurts for you.  I won't tell you to pretend it doesn't hurt, or to go out and find someone else at once.  You need to mourn the end, accept the new reality, and earn to celebrate it.

"You can't replace therapy, but there are things that can help ( you may already do some of them).  I'm going off of what helped me - I had PTSD from high school bullying, depression and was hugely overweight for a long time, so basically had shredded self esteem. 

-  Compliment functional things about her appearance on a daily basis - aka, things she has done.   Her outfit choice.  The way she's styled her hair.   This means you are complementing her choices and actions,  which are harder to dismiss than compliments about pure looks.   If you are complimenting parts of her body, keep it to one part at a time and frame it as ""I love this thing about you/I like your _ "" comments.  Saying ""you're gorgeous  "" or ""You have _"" or other open ended comments basically gives someone with self-hating self talk more opportunities to deny something without being forced to process it.   This basically holds true for any type of compliment or encouragement you give to someone with a negative thought cycle - ""I think/I feel/I like""-messages are key to having them listen to you. 

- Encourage an active lifestyle. Make sure you're both getting out and doing something, whether it's just walks around the neighbourhood, cycling or other sports you can do that don't require skin tight clothing or have ""appearance"" be a big factor or mirrors.  Cycling, martial arts (gi's are some of the most shapeless, body concealing types of exercise wear there is), western sword sports, hiking, running (sweats and a t-shirt).   The reason for this is two-fold - one is that if you focus on improving what your body can DO, it's much much easier to worry less about what your body looks like.    The second is that PTSD is often accompanied by depression and one of the best ways to manage depression (with or without meds), is exercising. 


- Encourage her to broaden her support group. You may not be a therapist, but understanding what has happened to her may help you be more sensitive to her needs and give you ideas of what to do.   The big thing though is basically making sure you can control your anger at her ex while she's describing the abuse to you.    Some people get angry when they hear about abuse that someone they love has suffered, but it's 100% safer to make sure you can contain it and express it when she's not around.  A lot of abusers use anger as a control tactic, so anger can have big triggers for PTSD sufferers, even if it's not directed at them.   You probably know this, but just listing it to be on the safe side. 

Good luck

"Gosh, my heart is breaking for you and your family.  


I don't have any easy answers, but I have a few ideas:


- Believe Tessa is controlling the phone, email and mail, so I'd say go through your brother for anything important.


- Sounds like your dad is letting Tessa control his relationship with his family OR he's doing this by choice.  So, I'd say, don't go over for the holidays or birthdays.  If you do, then you should just go - don't bring your kids in case your dad or Tessa are rude to them. 


- Has your brother directly asked your dad when it's just the two of them, why he's cut you and your kids out?  If not, do you feel comfortable asking your brother to ask dad what's the deal?  (Yes, this is like middle school, but that's what's going on). 


- ensure that your kids are ok and DON""T BLAME THEMSELVES for your dad's actions.  it sounds like your son is at an impressionable age, so it might be helpful for him to meet with a therapist for a few sessions to vent/cry.  Might be also helpful for you and they can give you tips on how to talk about it with your kids.


So sorry OP, because it feels like you're ""losing"" your dad so please give yourself time to heal and grieve.

"Unfortunately, this feels like a personality/age mismatch. For someone of her age, she sounds very normal and the age gap is still pretty large at that age. Personallly I have a 20yo GF while im 25 but since were both still students it works. However you seem very focussed on the future and having a sustainable life while she is still a student. This wil change in ~3 or so years once she finishes school/school mentality and then you will get closer all the time, however I doubt waiting that long is what you want.

Besides that her forgetfullnes is horrible and that alone would be a breaking point, especially when she uses it as an excuse to not carry her weight.

Sometimes in life you need to reevaluate your life and who you want to spend it with going forward and unfortunately it seems that you have reached the point where being sweet, loving, carry and funny just doesn't cut it anymore and where you are looking for an actual partner, not just someone you are with."

So I'm amazingly happy to realize that my brother and I are much more than just family: we're BROS. We have such a strong connection and affinity. It's a bond that surpasses just being brothers, I guess we're more like best friends for life. I feel really lucky to have him."

1.  She was mad you lied via omission with her back in the day
2.  Women hold grudges (so do men lol)
3.  This age gap and coincidence just SCREAM red flags
4.  She could also act like she didnt know, then once thet cat is outta the bag, she could start telling your son all sorts of stuff, true or untrue who knows that will make him look at you, your wife, and maybe both of his parents as a whole in a different, not so good light.
5.  ""Yea we had a lot of sex"" - you dont think shes going to tell your wife that, like in detail to horrify her, and your son much less?

Not only is this weird, but you need to tell your son first and most likely he out of it just being FUCKALL AWKWARD will hopefully drop the entire thing, if he doesnt, you need to then tell your wife and start asking your son how they met and if this doesnt seem very coincidental and has a HUGE chance of being a toxic cancerous jerry springer meeting.

If you decide to not just outright tell your son that Monica is NOT WELCOME in your home, for very good and obvious reasons (yanno, not being outed by your ex to your wife and son, causing emotional harm to both of them, AND you) then please film this as it will be the next ""Casheme Ousside"" trainwreck."

Heartbreak is fucking beautiful. We're gonna come back to how you'll feel better after this, but I just want you to understand the miracle you're experiencing right now. I've been in and out of a lot of relationships the past few months and I am devastated I was never heartbroken. 

To have your heart broken, it means you *felt* something for someone else. She was on your mind day in day out. When you went shopping, you thought about what she would say about your outfit. When you got a notification on your phone and it wasn't her, you got disappointed. When it was her, you cheered a little inside. 

I haven't had that in years and I long for it. Back in February a wonderful woman broke up with me. I didn't care. I was more upset by my apathy than the break up. 

I look back at my past relationships now and smile. They are proof that I can love. That I can care about someone so much it HURTS (like you are hurting right now)

You just need two months. 2 months and you will be okay. 

Here are the rules for these two months:

* *Separate*. Don't be friends with her. (This doesn't mean be rude or unfriendly). Do not go out with her, do not go to places she will be. Do not answer her calls or text. Do not even say goodbye. Just give yourself space to heal. 

* Train. Train in anything. A sport, a hobby, a video game. Anything where you need to apply yourself to accomplish an easy goal. This will occupy your mind and make it so your mind drifts to her less. 

* Organize. Keep your days structured, avoid downtime. It can be as simple as, 'watch tv' in the morning, eat lunch, 'play Atari (or whatever you kids do today), . Just having a day planned makes your mind drift to her less

* No. No contact with her. No love movies. Just give yourself time to heal and get STRONG. 

* Go. Go live your life without her. Figure out yourself without her in life. What shows do you like, not just the ones she told you she liked. Go do the things she wouldn't think are cool but you want to do. 

Finally, embrace being single. Being in a relationship is great, but so is being single. When you're single, you have freedom to do more, but you won't appreciate that if you sit around upset that you're single. Relationships are also expensive. Save if you want, or spend money on yourself if you want. Or if you're broke, be happy you can sit at home and not worry about spending money going out. 

You'll be alright, it's gonna hurt, some days you won't hurt at all, some days you'll hurt a lot, some days you'll hurt the most for a few minutes. If you find yourself crying, just do it somewhere you're comfortable. There's no shame in crying, and that is truest with heartbreak. 

If all else fails remember this, people get divorced after 16 years of marriage and are ok. So will you.

If money is an issue, you can also consider a $2,000 Civic or Corolla.  Those babies last forever.  😆

Now she has an actual life growing inside her and it's made her feel differently. No one really know how they'll react to being pregnant until they are actually pregnant. 

I think that thinking of this as a ""betrayal"" is clouding things and not helping OP as it's contributing to feelings of anger and bitterness. 

I can appreciate feeling angry, frustrated, and trapped by the situation and her choice, I just think that seeing this as a breach of trust and a betrayal is adding an extra layer of bitter on top of an already difficult situation."
"&gt; , but fuck you for this accident

to me it sounds more like ""we had a life long agreement to do X if Y happened, that our entire relationship is based off of and a major factor when I chose you as a partner. Y has now happened and you are going back on that promise""

"&gt; I'll ask him to spend time with me and he'll be miserable if I make him even watch a movie with me.

"You say you don't mean to sound negative, but you are. Saying no to every suggestion you're getting. That vibe is going to be picked up by anyone around you, and most people don't want to be around someone who brings everything down. I haven't checked but I bet if you Google ""how to be more positive."" There will be something, you're not the only one who's ever gone through this. You're not alone. 

Someone suggested flipping a coin, not a bad idea if you've self proclaimed have no interests. Finding a class or an introductory course in something that may not interest you but will better your life might be a place to start. Glass blowing? Pottery? Knitting? Since you don't like sports. Heck my city has pubs that regularly host table top and board game nights geared towards complete strangers looking to get out of the house. 

A cooking class. Or a lot of cities have night classes for intro personal accounting. Two options that would help your life out going forward, so even if you don't like it, it will be a bonus skill you didn't have before. 

Or like lots of other boring people who have nothing in common, go to a bar, sit at the wood (bartop not a table in the dining room) and strike up a conversation with the person beside you. "
"end the relationship now.  physical violence is never acceptable and is an instant relationship killer. the fact that she didn't accept responsibility for her actions and at least apologize tells me that if you let her get away with this by staying with her, the violence will continue because she will think what she did is fine and you'll forgive her.  "
I'd probably go with the option of finding someone in Japan to take them. Where did you get them? Can they go back there? Or maybe find someone who's interested and question them on their beetle nurturing skills. 
So if it's unacceptable why are you still with him? He had all this time and he chose not to work or study.

"I think you should think hard about whether this is a relationship that has a future.

Leaving out the subject of your boyfriend's distorted perceptions - he's made a commitment to his family. And you've said it is not one you're willing to share, because your child is your first priority. (Which does NOT make you a bad girlfriend; it makes you a wonderful mother.) And there's really not much wiggle room in those things. Like when one person wants a child and the other does not. You can't make half a child.

Some incompatibilities are just not resolvable. And you should probably consider that very closely, before you even work your way around to the fact that your boyfriend's attitude toward your work and priorities is highly questionable. "
"Don't leave him 5 million messages but there is nothing wrong with reaching out and telling him your feelings instead of just waiting and hoping he realizes how hurt you feel too. That's just good communication.

Maybe call or text him (whatever) and leave a message if necessary saying that the way he has been acting towards you is making you really sad. You don't really understand why he is upset but you want to and you'd like him to talk to you about it. He means a lot to you and this tension hurts. "

Now, to all the haters, being a prof is a public facing role but at the same time you need to support your husband and feel strong enough about your own worth to be able to tell people off if they give him shit about his field (and hey, when you have kids what if he's a SAHD and people make out like it's wrong, while having their own wives at home...).

Why are you disappointed?  Did you and he talk expectations about budgets, money, retirement, etc?  

Disappointment stems from expectations, which are normal things and good things as long as they are openly communicated and something you work collaboratively about."

"Stick to your guns. Tell your mother flat out that if she wants to come to the hospital for the birth to either leave Alan home or don't come to the hospital period, and that you will be informing the hospital staff that he is not allowed to visit you. 

Sometimes you have to put your foot down. If Alan texts you eight times in an hour, tell him to stop it and that you will not participate in his obsessive nonsense. 

You can't change your mother's behavior but you yourself can set boundaries. See /r/justnomil and /r/justnofamily for more support. "
"An easy way to answer this might be to just try new things and decide whether you like them enough to keep doing them. It's always good to challenge yourself and you can schedule it if you want to. Decide every week to do something well outside of your comfort zone and meet new people. Go rock climbing, go hiking, go bowling, go to a modern art museum. Definitely get on top of the birth control thing! That's not something you want to leave to chance. And join a local young knitting group so you have more friends your age. "

I don't really think rational decisions are in play on this one, but I'm hoping I just read it all wrong.. "
"&gt; I found my gfs journal 

I found your relationship problem, and it's very much not your girlfriend's sexual history.  You snooped, probably because you're jealous (though you don't admit to that).  Realistically you'll snoop again.

Come clean.  Throw yourself at her mercy, and pray she forgives you.  Realistically this relationship will devolve into a toxic controlling mess, or she'll catch you at some point in the future and dump you."

OP, theyre dating. Shes his second girlfriend. You can date someone and still have an expiration date on the relationship."

"Yup.

He wants to hear how much you regret it and want him back.  He wants to hear how miserable and hurt you've been since you dumped him and what a horrible mistake you made.  He wants to hear how you truly love him and always will, and there can't be anyone else in your life.

He has to stop contacting you, and if he won't be the one to do it, you have to."
Tell him that strangers on Reddit think he's hardcore.
"You just tell him how you feel. Basically what you just wrote. That you love and care for him, but that you want a chance in life at having a family, and you don't think this can be with him. So you need to end things. 

That's it. Then you go low contact until you are both over it. It may take time. Don't try to be friends immediately after the break up. That doesn't tend to work out well, for as long as there are residual romantic feelings. 

It'll be a grieving process. You may doubt yourself. You'll feel very sad. It'll be painful. You may even get angry (at yourself, at life, at him?). It'll be a whirlwind of emotions. But you've got to stay strong. You'll pull through. Keep the long term in mind. "
"OK, ok, ok... Let me start by saying that if you feel like an asshole, that is a good sign (because it means that you care about her and don't want her to feel like shit). Yes, not all men are inherently sexist, but just because you agreed with her and stood up for her *that one time* does not mean that you have proven yourself a feminist and are now exempt from all criticism or complaint.

It seems to me that you are saying that:
a) because she felt 'undermined as a woman', and insinuated that you (and/or your friends) had some fault in this that

b) you felt bad and

c) she shouldn't make you feel bad because you're not sexist and are on her side.

I want to start with:
Just as you want your feelings to be taken as valid (You feel like an asshole and don't want to be made to feel like an asshole.), you need to respect her feelings as valid. Why do you think your girlfriend would say that she feels invalidated as a woman if she didn't feel invalidated? 

To me this sounds like, 'I don't like feeling like the bad guy, so you should stop feeling hurt.'

This is not what being a supportive partner is about. When your partner comes to you with something, know that they are not making it up. I think the idea of 'intent vs. impact' can be very helpful here. You may have had a certain intent with what you say or do, but it may be having a different impact than what you intended. And when your girlfriend is telling you about the impact your words and actions are having, it is up to you to reflect and think, ""Ok, my impact is not matching my intent, what can I change?""

And I think your description of the 'you don't always feel undermined' conversation is very telling. Rather than taking a counter position (e.g. trying to prove that she doesn't always feel undermined), try to understand her position rather than jumping to discredit it. e.g. ""What is it that makes you feel that way?"" or ""What can I/we do to make things better?"""
"&gt;That being said, I'm more neutral (**don't really like**, don't dislike) with him than anyone else in her family and I am totally fine with having the children be named after those other members.

and

&gt;The problem is, in voicing this opinion to my SO she has become offended and **believes that I don't like her father**

and

&gt;I could show my SO that I love her family and that me not wanting her father's name **isn't because I don't like him**

You *just admitted* you *do not like* her father. Do not like is not the same as hate, and you understand that. You ADMIT IN YOUR OWN WORDS you DO NOT LIKE HIM. Just because you ALSO do not hate him doesn't make your girlfriend *any less correct*.

You also claim it's not because you don't like him -- while previously saying IT IS!! You're trying to say, ""I don't hate him, I just don't adore him"". But that DOES MEAN you don't want your kids named after them *because you don't like him*. Again, don't like is NOT the same as hate, which you seem to be clinging to for some reason.

You also say it's illogical for you to take out your feelings on your girlfriend -- but you're doing exactly that. You're hurting and confusing her over something amazingly petty and that 100% involves nothing but your personal feelings. She is being punished for your personal feelings, so whether you think it's illogical or NOT, that is *what you are doing*."
This is not a positive relationship. 
Definitely ask if you can borrow a sibling's room.  Also worth trying earplugs and white noise.  
"There's definitely some bad apples in CF but overall I find the community extremely sensitive and helpful. Once in a while I see some dumb insensitive stuff upvoted but usually these bad attitudes are downvoted. I think the colorful language is just a way to vent and shoot the shit (""crotchgoblins,"" etc), they're just funny and if you don't take it too seriously, it's a fun supportive place. But of course it attracts a lot of ranting by the nature of what unites us there.

Naturally there are all sorts of reasons people don't want kids and so there's crossover with antinatalists, who think it's morally wrong to have kids for various reasons; I don't agree or understand, but it's not a big issue having some diverse opinions in a subreddit."
"20 yrs congratulations. Does your wife have reason to not trust you?
She isn't home while you visit then it may be best to visit outside the home however your wife may be jealous of that arrangement too. As long as you are upfront with your wife about the visits she should let it go but that is my opinion. "
"This isn't the kind of big life decision that you should be deciding on your own. You don't go to her and say ""Here's how this is going to go, you'll move out with me after a year."" You guys BOTH have big life transitions coming up, and the mature way to handle this is for you to start having a series of discussions about what makes sense for your future. 

You can offer up her coming out there after a year as an *option* but this needs to be a dialogue and a negotiation."
Lol to you. Just because she's having a coffee drink doesn't mean she doesn't have an eating disorder. This is from somebody who had an eating disorder at a normal weight
"Talk to your HOA or condo association representative. 

I rent a condo and had parking issues. We actually have assigned parking but one neighbor kept taking one of our spots and double parking in a way that blocked our second space. No amount of notes, phone calls, knocking on the door, and threatening to tow worked. I copied he HOA neighbor on all texts and emails I sent too. She wasn't helping. She claimed double parking didn't affect me and that since she had never seen them park in my spot she didn't believe me. 

Finally called my HOA manager and told her that these neighbors were breaking the HOA rules and I was done being nice. I was going to instigate towing and possibly small claims for getting rent back as my lease stated I had two spots and I was unable to use either spot. 

She showed up ten minutes later and dealt with the issue. 

There's probably something about parking in your HOA or condo agreement. You may even have a right to have her towed if she double parks. "

"So, he broke up with you and called you a lying whore?

Then you two get back together (I guess?) and he bites you because you are beating him in a video game and calls you a lying whore again and threatens to break up with you, this time in front of his friends?

Now he is going to break up with you because of your scars?

Why on earth do you want to be with this guy? Your relationship is total trash, and super unhealthy and toxic

And if you are still self harming,  you **need to seek help**. Doesn't matter what the issue is, because it's still self harm. I'm sure the last time you self harmed you said ""I know, it's stupid and I'm never doing it again"" but then you did. There are some underlying issues it sounds like, I hope you get some help.

But as for what to say to him, you should say

""i'm breaking up with you"""
"What did you envision in your life together, exactly? A bigger house? More holidays? Fancier cars? Or just financial stability? 

As a woman I feel we do also fall prey to the societal concept that our male partners must make more than or equal to us, that even if we make our own money we still subconsciously crave for men to be our ""providers"" in some form or other. In this case, you had been hoping that your husband might be able to help provide you with the life you'd dreamed of. 

That said, his 8 month unemployment stint is a red flag, although I can relate to unemployment being demoralising and demotivating. Was he on welfare, or were you financially supporting him? 

Sometimes, relying on another person to reach your ""dream life"" is going to lead to disappointment, and you either have to adapt accordingly and ask yourself if you can live with the way things have or will end up, or find ways to achieve that goal yourself. "
"I don't know you and I don't have your mindset or your life, so I can't tell you why it is you don't get along with your peers, but I'm 23, and am not that far from your position in life. So what I'm going to say here comes purely from what I wish I had told myself at 19. Realistically, take it for what it's worth, and apply to your life what does apply to your situation. 

I too also had predilections for older men. I would always end up with these guys that were like 20 or 30 years my senior. I felt like I didn't connect with anyone my age because I felt like they didn't have the same understanding of life that they did. I felt that by dating older, I was inherently older, even if I wasn't older by the numbers. I alienated a lot of friends I had previously simply because I felt like I had jumped from 18 to 30 overnight. But now that I've had the chance to meet someone my own age, and have had a 3-year dating period and are about to get married next month, I realize how wrong I was.

I dated older men because THEY were on my level of emotional maturity. I dated them because the guys in my life were moving on from college and starting careers and I was emotionally stunted enough to think that older = wiser by default. I ""broke up"" with an older guy I was somewhat seeing because I quickly realized that if I truly wanted all the things I wanted from life (travel, marriage, kids, etc.) Then soon my older man wasn't going to be willing or able to do all those things. I knew that as good as it was, it wasn't built to last.

And then fiance came into the picture. We spent the first year of dating being super casual, but having lots of fun and adventures. He introduced me to metal music and we started critiquing things. He was so refreshing because it wasn't all about sex and work all the time. We actually had fun, and it felt like I had forgotten what that was for a time. 

Maybe you're in this position. Maybe you're not. But ultimately, dating older men is neither healthy, nor a long term benefit. Maybe you do have daddy issues, maybe you don't. But in any case, I think you should seek after therapy to unpack these issues.

You gotta know on some deeper level that this isn't going to pan out for you in 10 to 20 years. "
"The best revenge is to live well. She only has power over you and your relationship as long as you hold on to that anger. I know you are working through issues with your husband, and you need somewhere to put that unproductive anger, but wishing ill on her won't help you now. "

"There's a lot of hate for your husband here  - But it seems to me that it hurt him as much to say it as it hurt you to hear it. It seems like you guys shared the same dreams and goals when you got married, and now those dreams and goals aren't coming into fruition, because of circumstances beyond your control. He understands that logically, it's not your fault. But emotions aren't quite so simple. I think it's actually GOOD that he said it out loud instead of holding it in, so that it can be addressed instead of being repressed and leading to resentment. 

Can you guys try individual counselling? You need to deal with what you've heard him say, and he needs to deal with the difference between what he FEELS and what he KNOWS. You're both going through some really tough shit. I'd keep up with the couples counselling, but you also have issues within yourselves.
"
"Tbh if I were in OP's BF's position, I'd be thinking I might be better off with the other chick after all that. Only together for two months and other options staring me in the face? Hard not to let your mind wander. OP better try real hard to make up for trashing his room and even harder in making positive changes in herself."
"The red flags are on your controlling and jealous behavior. Not on her for having a normal social life. That's probably why she dumped you. The attractive girls you date will sometimes be in the company of other men or her single girlfriends, you need to get a grip or you're going to keep getting dumped and/or keep making your girlfriends miserable."
"Maybe because controlling, immature misogynists tend to seek out the company of like minded individuals."
"He really doesn't need to be making nasty comments to her or about her. That's not nice and he needs to stop that.

At the same time, he's not to be blamed for what he finds attractive. 70 pounds IS a lot of weight. No, it's not her fault, but that doesn't change what he finds attractive. I'm sure he understands bodies look different when they age, but they're both still pretty young and he misses the body of the person he fell in love with only six years ago before her illness. He can love her all he wants, but if he's not attracted to her, he won't want to have sex with her. Just like you or me have preferences and physical deal breakers for who we'll have sex with. I'm sure this situation is difficult for him too. I doubt he enjoys being in a sexless marriage.

That's why therapy is key. Both parties need to talk about their feelings and decide what is best for themselves. "

"I think what happened is exactly what you described at the end -- she got drunk, she didn't think to call or text you, and nothing bad happened. You two sound head-over-heels in love. She wasn't ""acting like herself"" probably because she was drunk and busy. It sounds to me like you were expecting her to cheat and now you're pulling at all these little details to justify your anxiety. It also sounds like you have a bit of a temper and keep in contact with her more often than most people. Do you get mad when she doesn't tell you what's going on in her day all the time, little updates and the like? Or when she falls away from her phone for a couple hours without warning? If so... Things happen. People do things that don't involve you, and it doesn't mean anything bad happened."
Even jokingly undermining your parent in front of your children is still undermining. Its a horrible thing to do and a perfect way to be embarrassing yourself and make your partner embarrassed.

I've noticed you keep adding new info that's just another bullet point in her cons list. I wouldn't bother telling her to contact you in x amount of days or it's over. That kind of just reinforces that she can do this fucked up thing to you and in the end it will be okay.

You'd think 5 months on a new dose is enough time for your body to be stabilized, but it isn't necessarily the case. It took me 6 months to go from ""Wow, these pills are the best thing to happen to me"" to ""This is the first time in years I am actively planning my suicide"" with no lifestyle or dose changes. Talk to your therapist, find the root of it. Don't make a hasty decision this big without some input from your therapist. A neutral party to keep you level headed is vital in these kinds of situations."

You have a responsibility to build up your childs' self-esteem. I would worry if you have multiple children, and one is hearing, that he would favor that one. "
Nostalgia is a rose tinted glass my friend. 
"So, LPT: being sad is not a competition. People think that by telling someone who's feeling depressed that others have it worse they're helping, but it actually does the opposite. 
Because then your brain just says ""hey! you're an even bigger piece of shit! you don't even deserve to be unhappy."" Which just sucks. "

You forgot that he threw a very public tantrum and was rude to his son. As well as the general throwing a huge dampener on his *son's wedding day*. 
"Don't sign the birth certificate until you get a paternity test. You should get one done ASAP. Talk to a doc about when is the earliest possible. You should also talk about adopting the kid out since it's too late for an abortion, which would have been the best solution.

Keep in mind that you do not need to and should not have a romantic relationship with this woman just because you maybe knocked her up. Clearly you're bad together. Don't compound your mistake by doing something stupid like getting married."
Well I guess I'm the odd one out for agreeing with you. I love data....and sometimes people just like their own opinions better I guess!
"15 is a good age to learn that you can't live your life based on what other people think or say. And if your friends are picking on this girl, you need better friends. If you ask her out and they pick on you, you've lost nothing of value.  

The most badass person I knew in high school was a girl who absolutely did not give a rat's ass what the other kids said. If a kid was eating alone, she'd march over and sit down with them. If a kid was getting picked on, she'd tell the bully to STFU. If they'd try to pick on her, it just bounced off her; she didn't care. She had a ton of friends and anyone worth caring about thought she was awesome. "
"People have assumed my brother and I are together too (half-siblings, so no physical resemblence, but similar mannerisms and dialect). We've collected many a compliment for a lovely-looking family when we go out and do something together with my daughter, and we take it in stride because the misunderstanding is understandable enough, and old people seemingly love happy-looking youngsters. But we're 28 and 30 and related, rather than one of us being on the wrong side of 20, so it's easier to laugh it off and say, ""oh, we're siblings, but thank you"".

"My roommate said she just expected me to figure it out. 

I can understand that things being tense would be a reason for her not wanting me there. It sucks, but I do understand that. I just didn't feel any of that awkwardness, so it came as a surprise to me. I just wish there would have been some sort of heads up, from anyone involved really. I discussed with another person in my group, Erin's roommate, and he said that she gave the hint to him that she wanted to hurt me by not inviting me and not telling me about it. It wasn't explicitly said by her, but that was the impression. 

I do plan to reach out to other people to hang out with them separately, but I don't know if I feel comfortable going her to place anymore to study. That is the context of most of the occasions we have hung out in since we stopped sleeping together and now knowing she doesn't want me there will make me uncomfortable. And I especially don't want to put the rest of my friends in that awkward situation in a way that might affect their studies. "
"Yeah... I think this is the main issue here. For most average looking guys, you might find a girl once a month or every other month if you go out twice a week, and that's if you keep your standards reasonable. Lower your standards, and odds go up, but most people aren't willing to do that. 

Anyway, I think that just with single guys, he needs to reign in his thirst. Girls (shockingly!) can tell when you're just trying to bang anyone, and don't want to be the one you're ""settling for"". Have a fun night, and if you find a girl by the end of the night, so be it. "
"Yeah, I dated someone like this. Any time a new game came out he said he didn't want me there for at least 24 hours so he could just play without me there to bother him. And if I were there, it was just so I could make him French toast. Sometimes I would try to stay the night so I wouldn't have to walk home alone in the dark (he stopped walking me even to the bus stop after a certain point), and he would sit on his computer until 2 am when he and I both had classes in the morning, refusing to turn the lights off, left his metal core music all the way up (dick move to his ""best friend"" who shared a wall with him... and me... his sleeping gf) and then would make attempts to kick me out when he wanted to go to bed because I would snore, I was too hot, took up too much room in bed, would wake him up, or wouldn't get out of bed and have sex, which to him is unacceptable. It was ridiculous, and a new game he wanted to play came out multiple times a week. 

Same with my high school boyfriend. Actually addicted to video games. The only thing he would do with me, as in ""I'll only hang out with you and stop playing league/wow"" is watch game of thrones, which I didn't like. So I was working way too many hours for a 17 year old, and when I could actually go see him, he was on his computer. I once had a breakdown at his house because he was being so lame about wow. They had a 20 person guild or something and had their night to play for 6 hours on Wednesday. And then it was suddenly 3 school nights a week, and they were my days off. And he just didn't care. 

I posted this before I made a point.
OP, this situation sucks. You always think there's hope but ultimately once a person has gotten that deep into gaming, they're never going to give it up, and their attitudes likely aren't going to change. Between video games and everything else there's not much time left for you, and that's where I was too, your boyfriend must think he can get away with anything and you'll stick around while he ignores you and is rude when he spends time with you. His behavior isn't tolerable, and when I was there I couldn't take it anymore, it's not a behavior that goes away. "
"No offense, but your a dumbass. If you let something like that ruin your relationship, you are the literal definition of stupid. People have sex. Grow up. "

"Thank you, I didn't know that. "
"You don't think a person should change a little over the 10 years between 16 and 26, no?

Not into personal growth or growing up as concepts?"
I agree it sounds like grooming. The second she hits 18 things are gonna get wild.
"It might not fit nearly into an eating disorder, but this sounds like disordered eating--specifically, binge eating. It's not normal. Is he starving himself, or severely cutting calories, otherwise? Starvation diets prime people to binge. "
"Can you clarify some.things you didn't specify in your post?

How do you manage life financially? Are you in a committed relationship? If so, how does your partner feel about all this? And if not, what is your plan of action in providing for the child? For what reasons are abortion and adoption not viable options for you? 

If you have any reason to be as worried as you seem to be about your parents reaction then you need to very seriously consider all of the above because they may not be supportive of the situation. "
"GTFO AND QUICKLY.

please???"
"I don't know what kind of advice to give you because you're obviously well set in your ways.. what I can say is that it doesn't sound like you're financially or mentally prepared to raise a child. Pregnancy is not a proper reason to wed, and the fact that you won't give a straight answer regarding your relationship tells me that it's not so well established. To get married shouldn't be something your partner is offering, it should be a mutual decision based on what you'd both like for the future. You sound like you lack a realistic level of independence and maturity for a parent-to-be. 

I suggest if you plan to raise this child then you'd better get a job and gain as much independence as possible. Your parents financial contributions and your partners offer of marriage will not do it for you. "
So I understand the reason Katie isn't a gf material is because she is up for casual sex? :(
"No, it's a mental/emotional thing. I eat until i'm sick if I'm stressed or depressed"
"Say if she wanted to get a proof of aboriginality certificate for her daughter, those three components would be involved. Most schools won't ask for any proof of aboriginality for the child's records but the government will, depending on the circumstances.

Honestly, if she didn't want to get in contact with her ex's family, there are ways around. DNA tests or asking someone Indigenous in the local area about her ex or his family are two that come to mind."
