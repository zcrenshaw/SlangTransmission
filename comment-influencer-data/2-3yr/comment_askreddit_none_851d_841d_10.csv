"The sub should be renamed to /r/liberal. If you're going to be content with one ideology dominating discussion than don't do so under the guise of neutrality. Do you honestly believe there are no legitimate politics right of center?

Also anyone who has been on reddit for more than a year knows the sub abruptly changed tone during the election when Clintons PAC Correct the Record and later Share Blue started astroturfing it."

It's a subreddit to support the President of the United States of America.

Who the hell in their right mind thinks it's a good idea to drop out of school and do a tech startup?
"Ok.  Can we meet in the middle here?  Fuck yes, if you're 'out in the wild' and you suspect someone is having a stroke, by all means dial 911, call an ambulance, get them to a hospital.

Their BP drops (which most people wouldn't be aware of), but most importantly they begin acting 'out of sorts', confused, they may experience paralysis on one side of their face/body, slurred speech, etc.  

For the record: if anyone in your vicinity experiences these symptoms please dial 911 or get them to a hospital.

BUT if someone you know experiences these symptoms and you call 911, or if someone you know is IN THE HOSPITAL when they happen, medical staff aren't ALWAYS going to be able to treat the stroke...immediately or ever.

There's really no argument here, obviously I agree that strokes are emergencies and should be treated as such.  But it kind of bugs me that the impression is made that some daytime TV doctors can operate on a stroke and fix it when that's just not the case.  Maybe they can, maybe they can't.  I've personally witnessed several strokes and NONE were rushed to surgery.  Maybe that's just the good ol' American healthcare system for ya.  IDK"

"I'm not sure if you're trying to be original, because that's obviously the Rick and Morty plot. It seems like you're trying to show some profound thought by making no actual reference to Rick and Morty."
"Um, your reference fails.

Keep telling yourself that.
The Calamity News Network must be focusing more on the calamity rather than the person associated with it.

"Hillary clinton was the best candidate in the entire election process. He knowledge of the issues and foreign policy experience made her the best option. Joe was also dealing with the death of his son. In addition, the russian/wikileaks misinformation campaign would have happened against biden. T_D was making up things about him being a pedo. We also have to factor in the 200,000 suppressed votes in Wisconsin and thousands of others in key states. We would have been fucked the same way.

"Who cares. They're both peppers and they are both technically ""spicy"" to different degrees. Just because they don't share similar rating doesn't mean they aren't similar ingredients. He didn't get tomatoes instead of freakin' peppers. 

Restaurants will never substitute the jalapenos to something spicier anyway, and banana peppers as well as jalapenos are pretty standard stuff for most fast-food. There isn't that much variety. People can tolerate milder peppers, but someone won't necessarily tolerate something spicier as it would ruin the meal. "
Even the President complains about how unfairly he's treated at work. That's not really gender specific. 
And from the continual pedophilia cover ups
He's an asshole and i don't like him.
Please name an example? Oh you can name 1 or 2 of the millions of kids in and out of stores every day? A display falling over on a brat is much more likely and dangerous...

"&gt; If you go to someone's house and they have a Samsung smart tv your whole conversation will be recorded and transcribed by a third party. If one of your friends has WhatsApp Facebook now knows your number and potential friend circles. If you have your photo taken by friends or strangers in public and they back it up with a cloud service that can be used to track the locations you visit.
&gt; Just browsing the web and sites are making ghost profiles of you, waiting for you to attach it to an account.

Don't use a Samsung fucking TV then. See, that's the point. You don't have to use any of this shit.
