"It's a classic case of wasting dollars to save cents. Your time is $X/hr, her time is $Y/hr, the programmer's time... By the time you spent one minute investigating, the cents saved by fixing it to her satisfaction had already been wasted. This only got worse as more people got involved.

Nice to see the VP layeth the smack down, though."
"Yep, our VP is a no nonsense type of lady.  My boss set up the meeting just for this reason."
"Congratulations! You have now been promoted to Tech Guru for your entire school. As part of your amazing new position, hordes of individuals will come to you instead of entering pesky work orders for the IT staff since you are officially Good With Computers!

Seriously, though, good job saving the day!"
"&gt; Come all!

This is really a case of ""It uses electricity so it's IT's problem!"""
"The classic ""I don't understand it so it must not be doing anything"" user mentality. Followed by total confusion after the take it off and something breaks."
Tales from Truss Support.
That's some fine boss work there.
At least he wasn't toggling the 120V / 240V switch.
There are thousands of people issued drivers licenses and buy cars that cant drive! Thats more scary. Ill gladly let him wreck a PC
"""Will the employee who took down the entire network in order to charge their iPhone please report to HR to collect their phone and termination papers."""
That might cause an issue in the maternity ward.
"&gt; Why don't you have $User go down there, since they apparently can't do their job anyway since their printer is down.

That was golden."
"Exactly! We usually say ""If it has a cord we own it"". "
"All this and more - with absolutely no increase in pay, or additional benefits! "
"In hindsight your response to the lighter should have been ""get the fuck out"" rather than just asking him to stay put while you get a flashlight.

Live and learn."
You mean....like a boss?
I assumed the monitor's settings menu. It was worse than I thought.
"&gt;  That just leaves the task of clearing out his inbox of 1.3 million new messages.  
Of course, then there's the disciplinary action to follow.

Disciplinary action means deleting his mailbox, when you fire him... Right?"
Is there anything better than seeing a problem user getting their comeuppance from the higher ups? 
"&gt;I make a mental note that SpecialArtist's needs will henceforth never be greater than my need for coffee.

I've got a list of those people, among them are the whole HR department and most of the second floor... The third floor would be up there too, but they'd take it badly and try to start shit with my boss about it.  
I've been walking through the building and been stopped by second floor people to fix an ""urgent issue"" that was just pandora lagging because of our shoddy net connection... We've since blocked Pandora.  
From now on, if someone from that floor stops me on a walk through the building, I tell them ""I just need to go get my coffee"" and ignore them until I do."
"&gt;Starts carrying on that I broke it again

We need to come up with a response to this sort of thing. The number of users who immediately blame us for breaking their shit with zero evidence or reason is just getting out of hand. Half of the stories on the front page have this as a central theme."
"On a similar note, my current reinforced concrete prof told us a story of how he was called in to figure out why a cantilever concrete beam was deflecting. He ran the tests and figured it must have been the contractors who didn't place the rebar at the correct distance in the top flange. Not believing him, they had to chip away the concrete far deeper than they should have to find the rebar. "
"&gt;I've been trying to turn it on for hours

*Flicks switch on, flicks switch off.*

*scribbles in notebook*

Observation of experiment #637. Computer will not turn on. Starting experiment #638.

*Flicks switch on, flicks switch off.*"
"I told a few colleagues in the cubes around mine about how someone called for something so off-support in the first place and I stumbled on the right password when I was just about to hang up. Everyone laughed. 

Except *that one guy* who takes the support limit so seriously he argued it was wrong to help her past the support limit and that even if I had stumbled on the right password myself, I should have told her nothing can be done and hang up. For some techs, it's basically a full blown religion. But I've always given myself some leeway when it made sense."
"Nope, that's why my manager setup the meeting.  He was sick of her wasting others time and was looking for a way to stop it.  Go to the Sys admin wasn't working, so he resorted to public humiliation.    "
"I'd be more concerned that payroll was being handled in an Excel spreadsheet, because how is the confidential employee information (tax information, bank account, etc) being handled?  
Even so, for that sort of situation where you absolutely cannot short someone ever, by even a single cent, then that's exactly what the `ROUNDUP` function is for.

*If common sense was truly common, it wouldn't need a name.*"
"Just thinking about the fact, that people like this earn more money than I. That's so sad."
"Boy or Girl?

Congratulations, it's a new IT person!"
Nah make him delete it then fire him.
So he just wanted permission?
Well to be honest that is the kind of thing that should produce an error message.  You get a pass in my book.
"But surely I'll pick up the network administration credential so I can install software on the school computers... right? ....right guys?

At my last school I was able to reset student passwords which came in handy more times than I can count - nothing throws off a carefully planned computer lesson more than when half of them forget (or ""forget"") their credentials and can't log in. Forgetting that they're blocked from YouTube when you've embedded 3 or 4 YouTube clips in their assignments, on the other hand..."
"Naah. This isn't the first time *she* has put in a ticket similar to this one. We often encourage our users (especially retail) to check cables if a device is not working. In this case, the device wasn't working and there was a blaring error message explaining the problem."
"I hope you logged a ticket, and CC'd their line manager"
Why does he have a PC that costs that much if he doesn't know how to turn it on?
"I had a similar problem with a customer and a network cable. Customer thought that since the laptop worked wirelessly, the printer should too. "
#humblebrag
"Hey, I have a problem. Do I need to put in a ticket?

Yes.

*Walks away*"
"I had a similar call once. ""The message says, 'You are attempting to &lt;do process that affects another team&gt;. Please contact &lt;team&gt; to let them know.' What should I do?""

""Um, contact that team and let them know?""

""Okay, great! Thanks!"""
"&gt; But in general she is socially awkward around me because she's from the deep sticks and doesn't know how to relate to us city folk

Exactly the qualifications you want in an HR person. "
"This reminds me of the frog jumping experiment.

Mr Scientist places the frog on the desk with a ruler in front of him. He then states:

- ""Jump Froggy, jump!"" and the frog jumps 10-inches. He records it in his log.

 - ""A frog with 4-legs can jump 10-inches.""

He then cuts off one front leg and places the frog back on the desk. And repeats.

- ""Jump Froggy, jump!"" and the frog jumps 8-inches. 

 - ""A frog with 3-legs can jump 8-inches.""

He then cuts off the other front leg and places the frog back on the desk. And repeats.

- ""Jump Froggy, jump!"" and the frog jumps 6-inches. He records it in his log.

 - ""A frog with 2-legs can jump 6-inches.""

He then cuts off the one back leg and places the frog back on the desk. And repeats.

- ""Jump Froggy, jump!"" and the frog jumps 4-inches. He records it in his log.

 - ""A frog with 1-leg can jump 4-inches.""

He then cuts off the the last leg and places the frog back on the desk. And repeats.

- ""Jump Froggy, jump!"" and the frog just sits there moving a bit. Not going anywhere. Mr Scientist repeats his command.

- ""Jump Froggy, jump!"" Again, the frog doesnt go anywhere. So Mr Scientists exclaims much louder!

- ""JUMP FROGGY JUMP!!!!"" And again, no movement. He records it in his log.

 - **""A frog with no legs cant hear!""**"
"That happens more often that you would know, I've been called in to give an expert opinion on  2 balcony failures in the last ~5 years where they put the reinforcement in the wrong face of the slab... thankfully these failures tend to happen on the construction phase and not when there is people living there, so no dead people on those 2 cases."
"""Should we include an error message if someone tries to print a page that doesn't exist?""  

""Nah, who'd do that?"""
"When you work for a small company, that answer is usually ""it's on hr lady's hard drive only and she locks the door to her office.""  Even typing that out made me cringe."
"oh jeez pounding on your door? feel like its time to have a little ""chat"" with her boss."
"I think it's partially because she has this self righteous ""My problems are important, don't give it to the new guy"" attitude.  But in general she is socially awkward around me because she's from the deep sticks and doesn't know how to relate to us city folk.   "
That was my first thought and I thought this story was going to end very differently.
"I've been trying to play Candy Crush, but this one level keeps... kicking my ass!"
Go put 2009 back where you found it.
"You didn't lie to the user at all. The user lied to you and you used that lie to your advantage. Can never be too careful, I mean this keeps happening so it must have been the virus, right?"
"To give ""that guy"" the benefit of the doubt: he probably adheres to the support limit because he knows once you go beyond the limit ""just once"", your customers will start to expect and/or demand that you break that limit *every* time. It may be something he's been burned by before."
"Wow. 

I feel like each '...' written by a tech represents a mild aneurysm. I had one of those moments yesterday. "
"I call it the curse of line of sight. 

""Hey, while you're here will you-"" 

""did you submit a ticket?"" 

""Can't you just-"" 

""no."""
People say all kinds of shit. Growing up we're told not to believe everything we're told. As adults you can say some dumb shit to most people and you'd be surprised how many people believe them. 
"Wtf O.o That makes no sense... 
Why would he move them back, and still think the problem would be solved? ..."
"I work It for a city gov agency. Our HR Dept is right next door. When we implemented our service desk HR folks felt they were above putting in a ticket and waiting their turn. After several heated discussions HR was told to stay OUT of the IT area period by IT director. After that they now follow suit.
"
"After 30 years of doing this, I just stopped trying to figure out what people are thinking."
Scary how someone could so arbitrarily remove something from the blueprint... that mistake could easily have gotten someone killed.
"I am the programmer guy where I work. And work with IT and tech support all the time. I have noticed that one of their most subtle tricks reserved for the most unreasonable users, is to comply completely to everything the user says. Idiots get so screwed, since they don't realize the unwritten protective function that IT plays even when taking all their shit. 

For example, Business VP goes straight to IT VP (CIO actually) and says your people are the most uncooperative bunch we have ever seen. We have all kinds of needs, all kinds of problems, but they never do anything for us. This is big, so everybody gets called into a room. I see IT VP and IT Manager exchange glances. IT Manager is contrite. I am so sorry, sir, let's fix this. I am setting up weekly review meetings immediately with the users. First week, two users dial in. Second week, one. Third week onwards, none. Two months later, IT VP takes the attendance sheet (which was being tracked), and goes to Business VP and says, hey, looks like all your problems have disappeared. We are good, right? Business VP has nothing to say. 

Most people don't realize how much they can get done simply by being nice to the IT guy. Processes are meant to be followed, but Process Manuals are meant to be thrown. It is simple, don't make them throw it at you. "
"If HR there handles payroll, it's usually necessary for the numbers to match up exactly even if the one cent is not important. Shorting somebody even 1 cent on a paycheck is very illegal even though it probably doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. 

So there's a good chance that the problem absolutely needs to be corrected, but she shouldn't go wasting people's time and company money when the solution is so obvious. The world would run a whole lot smoother if common sense was a teachable skill later in people's lives... "
Making him manually delete each email seems like appropriate disciplinary action. Sometimes you have 2 problems that solve each other.
[Sort of Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1172/)  
So you had to tare him a new one? 
"Yep, I've gotten calls that my colleague fixed an email issue on their machine 2 months back and today it won't print so he must have done something to break it. (that call turned out to be that this user has unplugged the printer because the cord was in the way and he thought it was 'wireless')"
"At my old company (I wasn't IT) the boss was trying to cut the IT department down. I had a friend in the department and I knew how busy they were most of the time. The boss's justification was that they were never really seen doing stuff and everything worked most of the time, and he felt like he was paying them too much.  

I asked the boss why the building was so clean. He told me we had people come in every night to clean. I then asked him why we needed people to clean the building if it was already clean. He looked at me like I was a dumbass, but before he said anything it clicked and he realized that the IT department was probably necessary. "
You have a *door*?!
relevant xkcd http://www.xkcd.com/530
"I gave a user a wireless mouse because the wired one was glitching out. The receiver was in the battery bay and I showed her it was in there and gave it to her. I was really busy at the time or I would have plugged it in and tested but she's used them before so she said she got it. A few minutes later she came back saying it didn't work. I checked if it was turned on and it was. Then I looked for the receiver in the docking station and its not there. Open battery, hello tiny receiver. I felt sorry because she was instantly embarrassed for forgetting it was in there and needed to be plugged in. We both laughed."
"In all fairness, IT isn't the be all and end all of the working world, it just seems that way for us since we obviously deal with it so much.

In their eyes, it's just an unnecessary burden - right up until something goes wrong, in which case it's all voodoo black magic anyway, so the difference between it working and not working is a moot point.

The thing that makes me the saddest is when I consider the sheer untapped potential for IT systems, when more often than not we are delegated to putting out fires and applying duct tape appropriately."
"I don't know what happened officer.  I accidentally stabbed the user repeatedly.  Then I noticed they were still breathing and accidentally stabbed them again.

Why does it seem like this woman doesn't like you? Did you embarrass her in front of a room full of people once before?
*gasp* The level 27?
I really loved the blackberry storm. I used it all the time to spoof the phone number of parolees' moms when I knew they were avoiding calls from my office phone. 
Hmmmmm. A microwave that always flips a breaker? Sounds like a fire hazard. It should probably be removed.. Go through proper channels to get it decommissioned.
Your flair really sheds light on your response.
well I'm not a monitor person
"Had that in one of the schools I work in today.

Check list: One ticket submitted.
Walking to get coffee, 8 different teachers stop me with issues. I ask the same question each time. 

""Did you submit a ticket?""

""No.""

""Submit a ticket. Then I will deal with it. You know policy and rules.""

It's amusing as they are always on about students not following simple rules, yet they fail to do so themselves."
Hopefully she got past level 20 finally.
"Yeah, one time some people on construction moved a bolt by a few inches and it killed 144 people. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse#Disaster

Edit:  [Here's the change that was made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Regency_walkway_collapse#/media/File:HRWalkway.svg), there was a rod that went through one bridge and down to support another, with a nut holding up that bridge.  They changed it to have a second rod hanging down from the bridge, but that put all of the weight onto the nut, which couldn't support the bridge when it was totally full of people."
"Oh dear, that sounds awful.  And Ben and Becky owe you a tablet I'd say.

You did the right thing, and it was only going to get shittier.  Drunk people are arseholes to work with, belligerent and ungrateful often.  Lesson leaned, next time you know it'll be babysitting arseholes you take a proper fee upfront in cash ;-)"
Hi HR... I'd like to report an issue that I'm having with some of my colleagues... who work in HR.
I can't imagine what sort of a pain in the ass tech is in high schools.  The moment the kids realize they can grind class to a stop by merely 'forgetting' there password.
"That's the logic behind having a support limit, of course. I explained to countless batches of new hires not to take it lightly; because even if it's easy for you, some customers *will* then call and expect the same from other techs not trained to do the same thing and might very well end up unhappy. It makes sense to adhere to it relatively strictly, or at least get an exception OK'd by escalation staff or a manager if there's a special reason. 

But clearly this was already solved, the issue was super unlikely to ever occur again and it meant the world to the customer. Pretending I didn't have her password at that point and hang up would have been so mean. At that point might as well try to sell her our [security suite](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2bzu7d/i_give_you_the_genius_who_hardcoded_a_fixed_2key/) while rubbing my nipples evilly."
I'm really glad that most PSUs can auto-switch now.
"Moments like that make me want to take a spontaneous week of vacation. I mean, nothing needs to be done anyway, right?"
"it's easy to discount people like this as idiots, but any of you remember [The 500 mile email?](http://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html)"
"I like the idea of the tickets for the stupid things. Even if the problem is obvious, it can show habits or other weird one off things. A device might only be disconnected on Wednesdays and that's when the cleaners do that part of the office."
