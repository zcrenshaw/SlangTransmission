3,"&gt; I saw a box of mints open and I'm an Uber driver so I was like ""oh shit I can get free mints for my customers"" 

Really? Is that how your mind works? "
4,Even the title of this made me lol and the story did not disappoint.
5,"The fuck up is him bringing up butt stuff with the guy fucking his daughter. You didn't have any consequences, not a fuck up. "
6,"Hahaha i had a similiar experience where i jacked(stole) the car to do a girl at the beach when i was done the car was NOWHERE TO BE FOUND i had to walk home and there was the car... My parents thought a good scare would change my ways... It worked lol

7,"Doesn't matter, had sex"
8,i once had a homeless guy ask me for money. since i had some i reached into my pocket and gave him a dollar. he was so happy and kept thanking me. I was like chill dude it's just a dollar. Later I realized I gave him the $50 bill that I just got instead of the$1. Hopefully he put a downpayment on a house. 
9,"Subject:  Error in my prior email

Body: As you may have noticed, there was a massive oversight on my part in an email I just sent you.  As a joke, my significant other created a Chrome extension that changed all ""?"" symbols to read ""you fucking idiot?"".  I did not see the impacted text until it was too late.  

As you can imagine, this is incredibly embarrassing for me.  I hope you can overlook this error, and perhaps even find the humor in it that she was attempted to create.

Again, my apologies.  YOU LIKE THAT YOU FUCKING RETARD?!

Sincerely,

OP"
10,"He's Australia n he could've died walking through the outback.

12,Find a new job mate. Then hit her up.

Holy shit, i was not dissapointed!
Quite a day you had huh?"
21,"Something similar happened to me a few years ago. We were selling our home and had an open house. A guy in his 40's asked to use the bathroom. We gave the go ahead. He was in there for a while so immediately after he came out I went in to make sure nothing was stolen. 

There was shit all over the toilet and smudged on the wall and the sink. He didn't make it 5 steps away from the bathroom before I threatened him with bodily harm if he didn't go in and clean that shit up. Took him about 10 minutes."
22,"I really hope the delay in this TIFU was about waiting out the statute of limitations to avoid any potential incrimination, OP. "

30,"I bump my head getting into my car maybe 5 times out of 8. I tried opening my apartment door with my car remote more than once. I got in my car only to realize I was sitting in the passenger seat. I put ""cups"" into the gps because I needed to get to walmart to buy cups. The list goes on and on haha!"
31,"There's no other way around it. 

Either you admit you like taking it from dudes, or are unfaithful with his daughter with other (wo)men, or stand your ground and let him know you're a faithful family man who pounds his daughters bum. 

It's the father in law's fuck up here for sure. "
32,"That's nothing. I once knew a girl who forgot she had a tampon in and, after her period was over, had nasty bathroom sex with a dude, and STILL didn't realize she had something stuck up in her insides. She also developed TSS and had to have the tampon removed by the doctor. 

She ended up marrying the dude who fucked the tampon up inside of her. "
33,"She might've forgiven you for hitting her with the ball, but not for running away.  Dude, you're screwed."
34,She felt so guilty that she decided to make it worse?
35,"Doesn't matter, had sex"
36,And we put numbers on them.
37,Funny story. So even after all of that my parents decided to not tell my girlfriends family to avoid drama. My girlfriend felt so guilty afterwards that she ended up telling her parents about it to clear her conscious. So a week later I had to go to her parents house and talk to her parents one on one and explain that I was sneaking into their house and screwing there daughter on a weekly basis. I did not see her after that. 
38,"I have always wondered why people do this. I see it occasionally in public restrooms. Did they shit in their hand and spread it all over like a bathtub crayon? Aside from mental illness, what the fuck is up with that?"
39,But he cried the whole time.
40,I read the title and got curious. I read the story and found the title that much funnier. 
41,"Umm, pics?"
42,the delay was because I am new to reddit:)) I figured that there wouldn't be a statute of limitations on littering because it's a ticket.
43,And learn to read and count. 
44,That was an impressive chain of fuckups! Have you gotten any better at handling regular life tasks? 
45,"&gt;Am I fire ?

54,"After giving birth I had to feed my baby formula to supplement because she wasn't gaining enough weight. You have to shake to formula in the bottle.  First week back to work, I'm sleep deprived and pick up a Coke bottle, shake it and then open it completely. It's takes me a few stunned seconds of ""Why is the formula doing this?"" for me to realize it's a Coke and to try and stop it. Bosses got a kick out of it and my husband had to bring me a change of clothes."
55,"&gt;so I jumped in my car

62,Damn I haven't heard anyone say that in ages.
63,"Holy shit. I'll admit the meme was in poor taste, but to go as far as arresting and charging you for posting it??? Geez. Sorry dude. That really sucks. Glad you're past it."
64,"Nah man, the local teens will love him. Trust me.

Source: was a local teen a few years ago."
65,"Are you trying to create a popular 2017 reddit meme, you fucking idiot?"
66,I started dating her when I was 13 and a couple weeks later I turned 14. I started sneaking out when I was a a littler more than 14 and a half and this incident happened 2 months after my 15th birthday. It was all spread out.

My condolences."
75,"Yeah, if they were out on the lobby counter this story would make sense. OP jacked cleaning supplies to poison his customers!"
76,She put a bag on my head.
77,"So were you 13, 14 or 15 when this happened? You stated all 3 in your post."
78,My wife ate our 2nd child after I told her she gained alot of weight during the pregnancy.
79,"American man, living abroad.

Seeking a good time, meets the landlord.

Ushered inside, what wonders await?

Was that a camel I just ate?

Alcohol appears, but it's not just beers,

Absinthe was among my worst fears,

The shot is taken, the room flies,

I awake the next morning with a case of the whys

Shower time, fix my head,

But something below is not dead,

A sly tug, a cheeky yank?

Nobody else here, time to wank.

It's dark here, where to shoot?

Who will receive my tremendous loot?

Low is safe, so I shoot down there,

It landed who knows where.

The hangover fades, but I still taste alcohol,

I’d brush my teeth, but the toothpaste’s gone AWOL,

Nevermind, no need for that,

I’ll brush it straight, like a cool cat.

It touches my mouth, it appears it got hit,

My jizz is here, holy shit.

EDIT:

Thanks for the gold, Reddit dude,

It left me in a rather good mood,

I'll display my gratitude for all to see,

And cut this short as I need to pee.

80,It **was** shit.

91,I can definitely see it as a post on /r/pics if the teacher's a redditor. 
92,"Weirdly, I had precisely the opposite problem once. Thought I remembered having put in a tampon before I fell asleep, but when I woke up, I couldn't find the string. Dug deep and could feel strings and a tampon-shaped lump just at the edge of my reach. 

Google affirmed that, yes, a tampon can get stuck up against the cervix. I read all about toxic shock syndrome and started to panic.

When I finally managed to get hold of the strings, I pulled hard—only to have my IUD land on the bathtub floor. It turned out that the strings were, in fact, from my IUD, and the lump was just my cervix itself. One of the more painful experiences of my life."
93,"It was so horrible I almost thought I had to be dreaming, but I can share it and laugh about it now!"
94,Especially since he claims to have said pics to an unlikely story. 
95,"I hate how they say the reason the sheriff was shot was a ""weapon malfunction."" That is such horse shit. The odds are so astronomically small.

What actually happened is that he is a moron who pointed the gun at himself while it was loaded and pulled the trigger. The only thing that malfunctioned was his brain."

98,I'm sorry but you were in the bathroom and thought they had mints there. There is no logic in that.
99,"If you're having issues with your car battery because of the cold, odds are you need to replace it.  "
100,"&gt; So of course I went for that, because it was a tree bridge and I was 11 years old.

It's not because you're 11 years old. At my age of 23, I would still try to cross that shyt. Imma feel like some kinda male version Lara Croft.

By the way, thanks for telling us how dangerous trees are. I'll keep that in mind and will offer goods for the yellow jacket cult before I cross."
101,"You shouldn't worry too much about it. I had a clutch of baby tarantulas get loose in my bedroom once. I caught as many as I could and tried to raise them but they all died. I figured that if I couldn't keep them alive myself there's no way they were gonna survive on their own. Haven't seen any since, either"
102,"I say you buy her a small bunch of sunflowers (or just something that isn't a rose. Roses are too dramatic) and apologize.

110,"That is indeed correct. I was having mysterious pains when I was 14, and had to have it done.

Let me tell you, it doesn't hurt.

It just doesn't feel okay.

118,"My father-in-laws brother (uncle-in-law? whatever) was on a fishing trip, fairly drunk, and talking about sex. I was pretty quiet, as my wife is related to every person there. But for some reason he calls me out to say/ask/rib me about something (I forget what). 

""Do you really want me to answer that? My wife is your niece.""

He got embarrassed, and the rest of his family thought it hilarious that he got himself in that situation.

Anyway - your father-in-law went there, drunk, took you, drunk, along with him. He made that bed (and you slept in it with his daughter).

121,"My dad is blind, so here's what I can tell you from my experience with him. Bill identification during transactions requires some level of trust, since theres no real way to know if the other party is being honest. Generally people are honest about it (either because they're honest or they're worried about getting caught), but if there isn't a sighted person with him that he trusts, my dad will often request singles just so he knows he isn't being ripped off. He also doesn't typically carry $2 bills or bills in denominations over $20 to simplify things. He also has an app on his phone that uses the camera to identify bills.

Once they're in your possession, there's a standard for folding bills. Singles are left unfolded, fives are folded hot dog style, tens get the hamburger fold, and twenties are folded into quarters. I guess you could fold them any way that you can keep track of them, but the American Foundation for the Blind uses that standard so that's what's widely used (typically other blind people, banks, or others familiar with the standard will follow those guidelines too)

Edit: This was based off my personal experience in the USA. I am aware that Canada has braille (sort of, they're really just full 6 dot cells) on their banknotes for this reason. Costa Rica has begun to use a similar feature. Most countries have different sized bills for different denominations which is somewhat helpful but I imagine still hard to tell exactly what you have by size in hand with the incremental differences in size that most countries use. Some also have tactile marks or watermarks that can be felt to tell denomination. The US has none of these things, and might have the least user friendly monetary system on the planet for the visually impaired."
122,"Yeah, if he hadn't have ran away, the situation wouldn't be as bad. "

It was this stupid thing on Facebook that would show you who you match up with out of all your Facebook friends, so I did it for fun. Unfortunately, when I did this, it posted a notification on my wall that informed everyone that I had just signed up for this thing, which in reality was a dating app. I never realized it until a few hours after the fact when one of my good friends commented on it, asking if everything was ok at home, lol. I can't even remember the name of the app anymore, but it was like Koosh, or something? Anyone know what that app was? This was a few years ago.

TL;DR: Married mom thinks she's signing up for a cute little game on Facebook, turns out to be a dating app, all of her friends and family get told she did it."

I don't think she'd forgive you if she found them. "

204,"I'm imagining in 6 months, when someone asks reddit ""How did you know you were gay"", /u/definatelynotrandi will respond with ""Well, I was 17 and working at this grocery store...""

Edit:FatFingers."
205,"Reminds me of middle school in Arizona. They'd give us detention(9th hour) if we didn't do our homework, and I didn't quite a bit. Whenever I got detention though I'd have to walk home so my mother could get to work on time. 3-4 miles in the Arizona heat when it could get up to 115 on a regular basis. I probably should've gotten the hint and done my homework, but I was spiteful of all the stupid school rules."

217,"My father suffered (as did the rest of us) with fecal incontinence for 20 years.
Because he lacked a bag to catch it, when he shit it just fell down his pant leg all over the floor. In his infamous career he trashed private bathrooms, public restrooms, the showroom floor at Staples, the middle of an Irving convenience store, my garage, my car's back seat, my brothers living room rug, the supermarket isle, and any number of other retail outlets, restaurants, and the side of the road. He was also legally blind, so someone else had to do cleanup duty.

To me it looks like you got off easy."

225,"Gulp, I can try.  I can do this.  

Really I just want them to have ""healthy"" relationships.  Like, age appropriate and all that jazz.  But who the fuck says what's appropriate?  Like to me, a 14 year old driving 40 min at night to fuck scares me.  The idea of a 14 year old getting pregnant freaks me out.  I didn't date at all as a teenager because I was told boys were so evil,  and that's not healthy either. 

So yeah, rambling.  Normal fuck ups as a teenager if possible, hopefully  no teen pregnancies, but hey, not the end of the world.  "

I get hit in the head with any sort of round things used in sports: basketballs, soccer balls, footballs, frisbees, hockey puck even when I'm not even playing the game passing by or just watching.

259,Speaking from experience here. A college friend one time left a turd in a roommates bathroom over the entirety of winter break. Come back and the smell took almost a week to totally leave. It was like it'd soaked into the walls. If that was my house I'd find op and get the shit fired out of them.
260,"Plus he says he was unconscious long enough for his friends to notice his absence, break down his door, take pictures of him, and have an ambulance arrive and get him to the hospital. Contrary to Hollywood, you don't just casually get knocked out for an hour and wake up perfectly fine. That's a serious head injury,if you get knocked out from head trauma and are out for that long you most likely have brain damage"

262,You're thinking of the cakes. Naphthalene ball are actually pretty small.
263,"As an ostomate, I apologize for this turd's behavior. Not all of us are like that. But when your bag is full, and I mean, **really full**, it's empty or pop.

That being said, if he had to legit change his bag rather than empty it, you can do that without getting shit everywhere. That asshole probably just gets off on making cesspits. "

293,"If it cost $400? Then the pot was somehow defective. A pot that expensive you can ruin, but unless it has problems with its metallurgy it will be able to survive whatever your stove can throw at it without melting

Alternatively, whoever gave the pot to OP's mother wasn't telling the truth as to how expensive it was.

OP, what brand was the pot?"

300,"Most of my injuries are to peripherals like limbs etc, I seem to be fairly lucky with what happens.  In addition to the amputated thumb and broken leg, I've broken both wrists, my foot, 3 ribs, crushed the end of my humerus where it meets my shoulder, fractured my olecranon (elbow), broke my nose, and broken off both front teeth.  All were in separate incidents.  The flip side is, that I have had lots of really cool and exciting things happen to me too, so I guess it sort of all balances out.  "
301,Most internet connected security cameras have a login in system to connect them. Most employers won't ever change the password off the default or just leave them completely unsecured. So pretty much anyone can just take control of em. There's an entire subreddit when you can just start watching people's houses due to unsecured webcams. Many of those security cameras also feature two audio so you could just play something on your end and it'll broadcast.

323,"As a female I'm a pretty reasonable gal. I don't feel like I'm very demanding or like I ask for things that are outlandish in any way. It is my opinion that having those photos IS in fact cheating. You're looking at someone you used to date or screw or whatever and at one point you had an emotional connection (maybe not a deep one but still) to that person. It's not the same as looking at porn. Porn is completely understandable but someone you used to be with (in any sense of the word).... No not cool. 

If i was with a guy no matter how serious the relationship was getting and I found naked photos of old girlfriends in his phone, take me out of the oven because I'd be so fucking done. "

336,"When I was 14, I would write letters back and forth to my girlfriend. Well, after a couple years of lovey dovey dating, we started discovering our sexuality. Both of our parents were also very Christian and would never let us shut the door in our bedroom when we hung out. So, we started writing back and forth about the things we wanted to do or try with each other. I never thought about where she put these notes. One day, I get home from school and my dad asks me if I want to get pizza with him, as surprised as I should've been, I agree because pizza. We show up, sit down, and he lays out the notes I wrote to my girlfriend. My heart sunk. He tells me her mom found them in her top drawer (Couldn't believe that's where she put them). So I had to apologize to her parents. Her dad was 6'3"" and had a massive mustache. I was a scrawny freshman. After class, my wobbly legs and I walked out to the waiting lot for my parents and there I see him, standing and staring at me, and points his finger at me. I walk up to him and he grabs my shoulder and says, ""bigtuuuna,  I was 14 before, and I had my fair share of foolin around with girls too. So I'm not mad at you for that. But, don't ever let me hear about this again or I won't be as forgiving"" he shook my hand with the force of 20 ton press, and walked away. 
I went home and shat so hard. That's it.

Tldr; wrote dirty notes and girlfriends parents found it and forgave me sort of.  "
