14,"Dude you posted the *exact amount* you messed up with. Do you really think you're the only person at your job who is on Reddit. ""Ha, say, Johnson, this guy says he messed up and lost his company ~1.6 million dollars, didn't we just have a guy lose ~1.6 million? Wait a minute, we lost *exactly* that amount?
Then you got fired. No surprise there brochacho: you royally fucked up, then posted on Reddit with exactly how badly you fucked up.

Well, at least you took the high road and- OH WAIT NOPE, you chided your boss, acting like a petulant child and pretty much guaranteed that you'll be blacklisted from the industry.

What were you even thinking? Sure, your boss was shitty but you lost any high ground you might have had when you texted her a temper tantrum."

There's semen on his shirt already, mom's grand-baby.

He's nervous, on the surface he looks clammy but ready to drop his bomb,

But he keeps losing the flow and it goes down,

His mind screams so loud

He points to his mouth, but that's extra, he's out

He's choking how, she's stroking now

The clock's run out, time's up, over, hunggoouwoww!"
17,"One time my Great Dane drank dookie water out of a toilet and when I chided him he tried to give me apology kisses. I still have nightmares about it. I can't imagine having a beagle sized poop missle running around my house. Good luck with your sisters OP.

18,That's the funniest TIFU I've read in a long time. 
19,"Odd that I hadn't seen this in the comments yet. If OP hadn't actually done an offense worth firing him over then he'd probably just get a slap on the wrist for being a dummy.

34,OP seems like someone I'd want fired as well.
35,"Yes, this is a true fuckup. Not one of those 'damn I had so much bad luck' or those 'X interpreted something wrong and now I may or may not be in trouble'. 

No, this is a fuckup in the purest sense of the world. You played Pokemon Go in your workplace, that alone is something quite stupid. 

They most likely will find the pictures of your code, so I'd recommend you already start looking for another job that is really Pokemon-friendly, that's the most plausible way to be hired in tech again if your company is somewhat big. 

If that doesn't work I recommend you start a blog, use this story to the fullest to kickstart a career as a Pokemon Go-master and start a gym or something like that."
36,What kind of demon are you tho
37,"Honestly, your experience was not that different from many first times. You had the extra burden of a language barrier and a time limit, but many of the other details are familiar to a lot of men.

The good thing is that you don't have to best yourself up over having a mortifying experience with someone you want to impress in the long term. You also learned some of the lessons many of us have to learn only by going through a bad time.

You didn't fuck up, you had a bad first time, like very many others have had and will continue to have. It was a learning experience for you, as it is for all of us.  

Now go out and meet a real girl. They are not untouchable goddesses, they are real people just like you. There are plenty of girls in your league. Remember that they have real problems and self image issues just like you do. They are not all looking down on you from above.

Go get 'em. "

I usually picked a loaf of raisin bread or a box of donuts."

50,"Ok, Dude.  Awesome story.  

You need to keep that and roll with it.  

I'm not sure what you were expecting, but you pretty much described every guys first encounter with a girl.

When I was your age, I was making love to a Swiss ski instructor in the Swiss Alps.  Sounds awesome until you find out we were in a snow bank 20 ft from the door of a dance club.  That detail sucks the romance right out.  

You need to find your own romance.  When u get back state side I want you to do something.  

Stop looking for a girlfriend.  And start looking for girl friends.  

What is your biggest issue with chicks?   You are over weight?

That is YOU!!  Not them.  

Your biggest issue is that you are concerned with yourself, not others.  Start focusing on others and the rest will fall in place.  "

59,"Your response sounds whiny. 

If HR is the one who handles the firing, then she has no reason to talk to you about it.  There is no space for mentorship here, you fucked up(payment), fucked up again(reddit), and then got fired because of it. Its cut and dry."

71,"OP, I work with live power everyday, I recommend you go to the hospital right away. Since you claim it caused you to poop there is a chance it went through your body instead of just your hand.

Edit - yes he's not usually so squeamish - but - friday morning i went to the dr for my 39 week check and he checked and was like ""NO NOTHING IS GOING ON have a good weekend you'll be pregnant for a long while more!"" - hubby was getting a cold so about midnight, after confirming with me that i felt fine and what the dr said, he takes night time cold medicine. I woke him at 5 am when my water broke and was like UH.  Baby ready to come out at 10 am, Hubby hadn't eaten, exciting situation, etc. and boom.  Hubby on the floor!

78,"Doesn't matter, had sex."
79,"Since nobody else has mentioned it yet, you need to know this is covered by worker's compensation insurance. From your reference to Barnes Jewish Hospital I assume you are in Missouri, whose WC laws follow the Federal standards pretty closely.

Your medical bills should be covered 100%, also lost wages for while you are recovering.  Severing of two digits will likely qualify for a small settlement under the law's PPD (permanent partial disability) provisions. If you get a lawyer to help with the WC claim be aware that the lawyer's fees do NOT come out of your settlement.

If your employer for any reason does not have worker's compensation insurance, they are on the hook for 100% of the compensation you would have received if they did have the insurance."

95,"Needless to say, OP is burning even more bridges with this follow up reddit post.

Not that he would get a reference anyway, but continuing to post about it after he was literally fired for it seems like bad taste.

OP, if you're reading this, please take the above comment to heart.  

Also, start working on how you will address the imminent job interview question of ""Why did you leave your last job?"""
96,"Actually, if you wanna catch Mew, you need to place your phone under a truck and run over it a few times. This unlocks the special Pokemon battle!"

No they didn't. Why the fuck would you assume a guy's first thought would be that you didn't wash cum off of your face?

113,"You know what? I'm visiting my dad this weekend. He's a doctor. I'm going ask him and report back.

130,"So we're supposed to believe that:

1. 100GB of source code is managed on a single server with no source control. So no one can know who has changed what or what the previous working version of the code was?
2. Devs on the team don't have local copies of the code (how do you write/test changes? You're all saving into the production directory in real time and in conflict with each other?).
3. There is no backup.
4. You have access to plug a USB drive into this server and run commands as root.

I've heard of bad engineering practices, but this is about as bad as it gets, if true. Assuming you're not fired, if your management is really this incompetent and won't change, get the hell out."

137,"It was pretty hot, gruelling work.  I had to put pans on a belt (Pan Feed), and then hot-dog bun dough would drop into the grooves of the pan.  The pans were still immensely hot from their last trip through the oven.

The dough never fell quite right though, so there was a guy that was stationed on what they called 'Weiner Shake.'  He had to jiggle the pan so the dough nestled into the grooves.  Seriously."
138,"Over time, your GPS signal drifts around since its only accurate to within a few meters. However, the game doesn't really take that into account and just takes what the GPS says as fact. So, even just sitting still, over a long period of time, it will think that you've moved a fair amount. Incidentally this is a fairly big navigation problem for things like aircraft and robotics. 

EDIT: Yes, thank you, I am well aware of the many ways in which GPS inaccuracy specifically as well as how robust pose estimation and SLAM are performed generally for areas like aircraft and robotics. However none of that is relevant for answering the question I replied to."

170,But back to a lighter note - it started a fire.
171,"After reading this and his responses on the comments, I think I'm seeing why his boss didn't like him."
172,"There are so many fuck-ups in this post...

1. Taking pictures of code with a phone. How about print screen? Or snipping tool? Or just copy-paste the *text*? Are you sure you're qualified to write code?
2. Signing a contract with really dangerous rules in it that you can easily break by accident (for example by taking a facetime call or using a conferencing system). Note that if you have internet access on your machine, you don't need a phone to take pictures of your code. You can just copy-paste the whole shebang to pastebin anyway. If your company trusts you not to do that, then they might as well trust you not to take photographs of client data.
3. Working for a company that treats its employees like criminals by default: Taking a picture of nothing in particular means your phone gets confiscated? Do you also torture people to death if they make bad puns? If you work for a bank in IT, you certainly can get a different job.

Whenever someone in the office tells me that I am not allowed to do &lt;generic action&gt; because it could be abused against the company's interests, I explain to them that I have all the private keys to all the servers. If you trust me with that much responsibility, then you might as well trust me to be somewhat responsible when using my phone.

Edit: people don't get it: It's not about me wanting to destroy data, or threatening to do so. It's about me having so much responsibility that not trusting me with a phone camera is hypocritical, and disrespectful. Either you trust me, or you don't. You are giving me a loaded machine-gun that fires mini-nukes (because you know I need it for my job which involves mutant server bugs), don't complain about the dull pocket knife.

You should not *assume* I am trying to destroy our business, because if I wanted to, I totally could, and yet I'm here every morning and solving problems instead. If you assume for no reason I am evil and out to kill the business that pays my wage, then I do not want to work for you, because you're a huge asshole: You think I'm evil, unprofessional and retarded.

Disclaimer: It's completely fine to make a list of things that are really bad for the business (such as leaking customer data) and ways how that might happen by accident and then tell me about them all, just so I can be on guard against it. I make mistakes too. Just don't limit my freedom in pointless ways that you know will annoy me and have no further effect at all.

TLDR: Don't work for assholes (if you can afford to).

Edit: Stop telling me you wouldn't hire me. Guess how many fucks I give about some guy (who does not own a company) on reddit telling me he wouldn't hire me."
173,"Years ago my ex move out of my apartment following a breakup. At some point while we were still together she had purchased a squash and put it in the vegetable drawer in my fridge. Since I was the sort of person who only cooked canned/frozen foods and kraft dinner, it was months before I realized it was in there.

I reached down to scoop it up and my fingers basically passed right into it with no resistance. It was so soft, it pretty much liquefied as soon as I touched it."
174,"I was a waiter at a restaurant in college and I was typing an order into a touch screen register that kept freezing. I got frustrated and slammed my hand into it shattering the screen.

Above the register was a bucket filled with rolled silverware. I immediately grabbed the bucket and pulled it down on top of the register.

The manager came running out and saw me holding my arm like I was hurt. She was so worried about me suing that she didn't think twice about the broken register."

You shit on the person can tell her whole department to disclose what you did in case a future employer is running a reference check.  AND you posted about it when you know they know you're posting about them.

Perverted (and possible pedophile) babysitter pushes kid out of bathroom to take a dump (and possibly jackoff) with used panties in bathroom. In some type of sick perversion, throws the panties in the kids face, then tries to bribe (and possibly kill) the diabetic kid by buying him ice cream ***and leaving him alone to fend for himself***. Luckily, the parents got home before he could kill the kid with the devil sugar, but the babysitter still manages to snatch a stuffed monkey out of the crying kids hands.

he was on his radio screaming that i was in the process of assaulting him and needed backup... at literally the same exact time i was already on 911 with the operator asking for state police help. 


edit - i should add to this, the state police never came. they just sent more small town cops form surrounding towns. some came for his backup call, others for my 911 call. all obviously immediately came to his 'aid' and arrested me. 13 in total. charges all dropped ~ 2 years later (aggravated assault on an officer, obstruction of justice). private investigator/ex LEO knew particular cop right away, apparently had a history of this kind of stuff. mysteriously 'retired' a couple years early from department, before being eligible for the sweet pension. did not become a cop at another department. i'll never know what really happened, but he got his somehow."
199,"My dad used to work at the former Los Angeles Entenmann's bakery back in his youth. One of his jobs was removing angel food cakes two at a time from pans. To do this, you'd swing the pan up in the air and slam it down hard, and it'd pop out of the pan perfectly. (I tried this recently and amazingly it works, but scared the bejeebus out of my dog). Around that time, dad took a home economics class at high school. One of their recipes they'd do was, surprise, angel food cake. To remove her cake from the pan, the instructor cut timidly around the cake with a knife and tried to ease the cake out of the pan, leaving an ugly misshapen cake that she tried to instruct students on how to dress up so it wouldn't look so bad. When it came time for my dad to remove his home ec. cake from the pan, he did it just like the factory, and swung it up in the air and slammed it on the counter, causing the teacher to shriek! Then he pulled up the pan and revealed the perfect angel food cake. "

I watched some depraved shit to keep hard after a while... anyway gave up jerking for about a month and a half to let my dick/psyche heal before finally finding time and the drive to engage in hand to gland combat.

Came buckets after touching it for 2 minutes while the two porn actors were kissing. I'm pretty sure if you showed me a blurry jpeg'd picture of a decent butt I would have busted in my pants.

Whereas other needles are used to stab you and take stuff from you. 

Stuff that is part of you. 

From inside of your body.

And you can't see what they took or left, and you can't reach to check or look.

Your body is no longer an enclosed system, and outside forces are stabbing you and fucking around with your insides.

And even if you pull it out now, it's already happened. You have already lost the fight."

221,"His problem probably had little to do with watching lots of porn. It probably had more to do with his anxiety level, which completely kills erections. 

1. He was in an unfamiliar city, an unfamiliar environment, and an unfamiliar social setting. These are all going to put someone into an alert state. 

2. He probably subconsciously picked up on her cues of disinterest, which might have added to the nervousness of the situation. 

3. Suffering ED was probably causing an anxiety feedback loop. (ie the more ED happens, the more anxious you become, which makes it happen more).

4. The whole encounter was put on a timer.

To put it in perspective, imagine a situation where he knows this Brazilian goddess socially, and she expresses an interest in seeing what kind of porn he is in to. They watch porn together at his place of residence for a time, and then they proceed gradually through progressive levels of physical relations. One can image a very different outcome in this scenario!"

Whatever the fuck you're doing, stop it immediately. Imaging the drive is the first thing you need to do, so you have an exact copy of whatever the current state of the drive is, before you go fucking around with shit any more.

&amp;nbsp;

Take a memory dump (to an external device, not the local disk), then power down the server, boot from external USB/CD and clone the disk to an external USB drive. Something like a 1TB WD MyPassport is less than a hundred bucks and should do. Supports USB 3.0 with a write speed of 109MB/s.

&amp;nbsp;

After that, you should probably not touch the system and let a professional handle it.  You may do more damage and then you'll really be fucked. As it stands, your data is probably recoverable if you don't fuck it up worse. The more you fiddle around, the bigger the chance is that you're going to make the data unrecoverable.
