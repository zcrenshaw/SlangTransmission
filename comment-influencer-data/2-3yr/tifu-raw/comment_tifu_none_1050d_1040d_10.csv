6,"&gt; the cops were on us for hours and were not too lenient. We got a hefty fine for disturbing the peace, citizen hazard, slight vandalism to a neighbor's property, instilling fights and (mild) injury on our property, with an official warning ensuing, but we did not get in further trouble with the law because the sheriff and chief are pretty understanding. Four citizens (so far) are threatening to take us to court.

Whether you are guilty of any crime, owe any fines or are liable to other families is for a court, not ""the cops"" to decide.  I'm dubious that you committed any crimes here, unless you intended that mayhem.  Those charges all sound very vague.   Moreover, if you plead guilty to any crimes, you increase the risk of being found liable in a civil suit, which could cost you much more than the criminal fines.

I would strongly recommend you **get a lawyer** right away to help you with this.  Could save you a bundle in the long run."

Quick story. Back in high school, junior year I fell asleep in class. That day we had a sub teacher. Instead of teacher going over my desk to wake me up he proceeded to take my backpack and put it outside in the school hallway. The thing was, I had my ipod inside my backpack. Woke up, looked around for my backpack couldnt find it. Classmates told me teacher took it and put it outside in the hallway. Went to go check, and guess what? Backpack was gone. Someone stole it. Called my mom &amp; brother told them exactly what happened. We took this to the principal, had a meeting. I got trash pick up as a punishment for falling asleep in class but the sub had to purchase me a new ipod. "

So, the FBI would also be involved. 
Or he can give you the iPod and your passwords and call it a day. And this guy is never going to like you anyway, so it can't negatively affect your relationship with his daughter any more than it already has. "

I drank all of mine, and was pretty drunk. Around midnight me and her really fucked up watching wwe lol and her dad just barged in pretending he had no idea I was ever there, telling me to get the fuck out, and that he called the police on me to tell them I got his daughter drunk. I decided to just leave. when I got home realized I had no phone, must had left it, and my wallet at her house. Fast forward to afternoon, I come over while he's at work to find out from my ex he reset my phone and has it on him claiming ""it was his now"". Thanks to TILE, a small tracking device in my wallet, and my short talk with the sheriff's office. he was arrested for theft, assault, and resisting arrest.

he never returned the phone, or my Louis Vuitton Wallet (it was real). we will be in small claims court today actually at 8:30 am.

You need a fake surprise now to cover for the real surprise. Buy her some random(clearly not marriage) ring that she would like, online off of etsy or something. Have it addressed to her so she opens the package. She'll see it, be confused, and then you tell her that you just wanted to get her a gift. She always wears a ring so you thought some kind of ring would be a good idea. Be aloof and act dumb and innocent. You just wanted to be nice. 

She'll be kind of let down, but unable to show it because you cant just tell your bf you thought he was gonna propose. She'll just probably think youre lame and that she misread the signs and accept you werent planning on marrying her. 

Now you gotta act fast though lol.

I feel like this is a personal surroundings issue, as my troop was more focused on learning traits and abilities to survive in the wilderness, experience new events, and just have fun. 

Your entire issue right now is that you're in an incredibly religious surrounding. Everyone around you seems to be a ""God or Hell"" kind of person. The fact that your own father is berating you for a lack of faith is sad enough, let alone getting others to force it down your throat. That is not a positive environment, and certainly not what the scouts are about. At this point, you have two options, try to find a new troop, one that isn't supremely religious like this. Or you're going to have to own up to the fact that your dad is more concerned about his religion, than about your happiness right now. "

My advice to you. Soy down and seriously think about whether you want to continue with the BSA considering your reservations about their track record with LGBT,atheists,etc. Do you think they deserve *you*? Then, if it comes down to it, sit down with your scoutmaster and make your case. Point out that pretending to believe in God would be dishonest and run directly counter to Scouting ethics and values. Finish your project. Do it for yourself, not a rank or badge. Ultimately you may not get the rank, but if you want it, fight for it.

Alternatively, you could keep your mouth shut, and earn the rank, then refuse it on the grounds that the values and ethics the BSA taught you are incompatible with the BSA's treatment of gay and atheist scouts. That would make one HELL of a statement "

106,"I wouldn't suggest contacting a lawyer or police right away.  That is a big escalation for your gf father.  Assuming you want to be on semi good terms with her family if you are serious about her, maybe just go talk to him face to face and be firm.  Tell him that it is your property and he effectively hacked your accounts and stole personal information from you.  Try and be respectful so he doesn't try and retaliate against yalls relationship and make things harder but be firm and tell him you need YOUR property back now.  If he refuses then if you have to escalate it further, when people ask if you talked to him you can say you already tried.  I know most places wont take you seriously unless you have at least discussed it with the other party especially if you are a teenager. 

 Also, the NSFW pictures he has if he shows anyone that would be considered in the child porn section as he looked at then proceeded to steal them without permission from the owner and possibly show other people explicit pictures of a minor.  All in all, he is in the wrong but try and resolve this in a way that will let you still be able to see your girlfriend if her dad still has that much control over her.  If you don't care then yes you can get him into loads of trouble.

Now why I replied to this comment. Being an eagle scout means fuck all conpared to your schooling. No one and I mean no one will hire you because your an eagle scout if you don't have a degree. So if it were me I would say screw the project and maintain your GPA and your sleep. "

111,"As a father to a different son, your dad is an asshole.

You do not purposefully fuck with your son's future just because he doesn't believe what you believe.  I can't believe he would contact the scouts because of this.  No, don't lie to you dad's face.  Truth sets you free.  Never have to remember what you said when its the truth.

Proving the negative, I love this one.

Tell your father to prove to you he never cheated on your mother and then you will use the same logic to prove god doesn't exist.



Just keep going and if the Scout Master brings it up, this is where you lay into your father about keeping family shit in the home and he has no business nor right discussing something that is a family matter.  If scout master pops the question, why no god, just tell him the truth, God just had my father stab me in the back, his son, over belief in him and you have to ask why I don't believe?  Belief in god can set father against son and I will never do that to my family.

115,"If that was my son, I'd just go over to his house and demand he gives the iPod back, unlocked and with the accounts back to normal.

The complication is that the son did give the phone to his girlfriend, and the father DOES have the right to confiscate the phone from his daughter.

However, he DOES NOT have the right to access the device.

If you do confiscate someones phone, you simply turn it off and leave it alone.

Going on to access his facebook, instagram, and email accounts, and proceeding to change the emails and whatnot, That's a crime.

In this situation, The dad should be going to his house and saying: ""Hey father, My son has told me that you have changed the emails to his accounts, Could you kindly change them back and hand my son back his iPod"".

If there is any other response, that is simply not co-operating with this demand, take it to the police/ Community support officer, and force him to.

edit: The last thing you want to do here is escalate it to the police. While it's the most effective at dealing with the problem at hand, it's also the most effective at pretty much breaking the relationship between OP and his girlfriend. If the problem can be resolved with a simple request from OPs dad, there is no need to take it further.

reading the edit 4 of OPs post, I do believe the father handed it to the high school, which to me shows that he knows he is in the wrong, and isn't ready to confront OP or his dad about it out of embarrassment."

I think you are just unlucky that you are coming to age just before this happens.

Having said that, if the answer is 'Yes' then you have a couple of options.
Well maybe just one, depends on your Dad really.

Have a sit down with your Dad and tell him under no uncertain terms how you feel about the organization, where you are in your life, and that you have been looking forward your entire life to the Father/Son project that is getting your Eagle Badge.

He will either come around, or he won't.

So when her birthday came around I got her a nice-but-not-wedding-ring-nice ring. Like $100, silver, went well with her other stuff but obviously wasn't what she was expecting.

When I acted proud of the gift she realized she must have just gotten too hopeful, she calmed back down and life went back to normal for a little bit.

186,"This is good advice OP. You have 2 discrete choices. If you think being an Eagle Scout will profit you so much that you're willing to participate in a lie to get there (and basically everyone has done this on some level, even if it's just pretending to like a job you hate) then go ahead. If that's your decision, you can treat it like any unpleasant task that helps you: just feign your conversion efficiently and get through it and get your badge, then bail. Having said that, it sounds like a tremendous amount of work and not something you can do lightly.

So if, as it seems, your principles are actually worth more to you than the advantages that being an Eagle Scout will bring, then don't. It seems like these advantages are not the be all and end all: helpful if you want to join the military or something, but even then, not life changing. In that case, be proud to be someone who is principled, and know that, even though this might feel like a failure of sorts, it's really not, it's actually the making of who you are.

There can be something very personal and ennobling about saying: 'I stand to profit from this, but I would rather turn it down than participate in something I cannot condone'. If you decide to go ahead with the pretence, no one could judge you, like I say, people do this every day on some level. But you won't be throwing away value if you don't; you'll be controlling your destiny according to your rules, and as a man who has dealt with the vicissitudes of both doing that and not doing that, i can tell you it's worth a lot.

Good luck friend."

If you're uncomfortable with lying, remember this: being able to lie convincingly is another one of life's skills that you'll need, despite what the Boy Scouts may have told you. You don't want to do it often, but you're gong to have to do it once in a while if you want to get through this life. And when you think about it, as an atheist, this is a very small lie. It's equivalent to telling a child about Santa Claus. It's what we do to keep small minds happy, until they're ready to face the truth. It's a gesture of kindness, to be honest."

Also, as soon as it started going to shit wouldn't you have stopped handing them out? So there shouldn't have even been that many kids with them. And it couldn't have been that it was the end of the night and you handed all of them out already, because then there wouldn't have been nearly enough kids still out to cause that much mayhem, especially for so longer afterwards.

 - If the person you're sexting with is under 18: Contributing to the delinquency of a minor

You can have any one, or all, of these charges thrown at you for sexting underage."
301,I'm pretty sure I should be fucking dead here. I have to cross 3 different gang territories just exiting the freeway to come to work. 
302,"Yes, but what age for us people that don't come from freedom country?"
303,"I didn't have to read the post history to smell BS.

The story breaks down immediately when you consider how many Trick or Treaters carry lighters around to light these fireworks.  While I guess you could assume they borrowed their parent's or used a pumpkin those don't really make sense either.

Spooky Shit That Didn't Happen.txt

As a consolation here is a Halloween decoration my brother and I built this year.

305,SHOW US THE SALT DOG
306,"im not a really sensitive person, but it really catches me off guard how things will strike me.  this post and the other related stories makes me sad.  these gifters gave a really good gift, and people didnt know at the time.  the reaction of the people receiving the gift im sure was not un noticed.  they ask ""did you get that gift i gave you?""  and then the recipient just shrugs off a half assed answer ""oh yea, sure thanks"".  it makes me sad and im not really sure why."
307,"SLI is pretty much a waste of money for gaming or has been until recently. I think the 900 series and above actually provide significant boosts when paired, but I decided against it with my 970 since you don't get twice the VRAM with two cards and I would rather save my money for a while and do SLI when there is more VRAM available in graphics cards than games know what to do with."
308,A parent has no right to just kick someone to the street. They have to provide the same notice they would provide a tenant. I would go right back to that house and force them to follow the law and then I would take the things that belong to me with me...  then again I wouldn't be the moron to leave drug edibles in the fridge... so OP kinda walked into this situation.
309,oh noooooo
310,"quick, everyone, act like you're on my side. i'll use this post as exhibit A"
311,"You put the gloves on your HANDS, not your GENITALS. :)"
312,"You're probably not the first person to get shitfaced on Nyquil. But you're probably the first person to so literally get shitfaced on Nyquil.
"
313,Perhaps she'll die
314,FWIW those kids had the Halloween of their lifetime.
315,"Considering the extent that he went to by changing the passwords, it's easy for OP to claim that he never put that content on there and the gf father is trying to frame him."
316,That's the kind of cred that ensures the weaker drones save you the jelly filled donuts in the breakroom.
317,"Yo here's some blood shit on my finger to prove to you I was really blood shitting. 


Oh... You don't want to touch it?  OK then. 

*proceeds to wipe it on the jeans*"
318,excuse me m'lady
319,I wouldn't classify this as a fuck up. You got bonus points and you started a small riot in your class. Sounds like a normal day in college.
320,"&gt; he would contact the college's IT people and see if they could track down the offender's IP address through the Google survey

I guarantee that this will just end up with the IT people laughing their butts off in their office."
321,Why don't you need to slide?
322,Why didn't you just open your mouth if you were in the shower anyway? 
323,The next logical step is to set up Thunderdome on the lawn next year
324,He saw me take the stuff of and go back to doing my job before he came and talked to me.
325,"Yea, then he can plead insanity"
326,"&gt;  He wants to contact my dad first and discuss with him everything on my device (including some person information only I know about).

I think the other dad wants to get in touch with OP's dad anyway. To be honest, if my daughter is failing and I want her to study but some kid gave her an ipod with nudes on it I wouldn't be too pleased either. I wouldn't go as far as changing his social media's passwords though.

327,DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY SPACE IS SAFE?!?!
328,And a bumblebee fighting a witch.
329,That is fair. He was questioning how someone can die relatively young and was more in denial than anything. 
330,He really shot from the hip with that one.
331,"&gt;He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly  
  
When you spend your life in search of something, eventually that is all you see"
332,JESUS FUCKING CHRIST THAT IS HORRIFYING
333,"Old enough to have a girlfriend and smoke pot, but young enough that the girlfriend's dad still has control over her usage of electronics. I would put them in the late teens range. "
334,You're telling me you and your kids share a reddit account. Thats the most ate up thing I've heard
335,"[-""It's so dark down here...I can't see a thing!""  
-""Oh no, what a nightmare!""](https://youtu.be/D7E-D1KvXxE?t=1m7s)"
336,"No need for a lawyer.  The story is bullshit. Check OP's history.   

/r/quityourbullshit"
337,Truth.  Rule #1 be attractive. Rule #2 don't be ugly.  As a 40 year old eagle scout who is atheist as well. Lie. No one can check the choir log or ask God if you are true to the faith. Lie. Get the job done. Move on. Lie. Ask your dad if your parents were married before they had sex. Lie. Ask if daddy watches tv or drinks a beer now and then. Leviticus is a great. Lie. In the end it won't matter. Lie. 
338,"imo, if they think it's a big deal you should *absolutely* rub it in their faces.

If that was his reasoning, more power to him.

If it wasn't then I can see why you'd be pissed."
