0,"I love the logic of ""girlfriend gives a baby toot before oral, I must shit air into her mouth to requite my love"""
1,"I avoid the treadmill because I can't run on them gracefully.  The guy next to me is always running smoothly, you hear a near silent *skiff skiff skiff* as his shoes make contact with the belt, when I run it sounds like a retarded dinosaur with two different sized legs going on a dumbass rampage."
2,I'm imagining somebody trying to perform cpr or the heimlich maneuver on op in this situation. 
3,"Accident or not, buy your cat a tin of the best food you can afford. He deserves a extra treat. Furry little asshole saved you a hell of a headache. "
4,"I have a slightly less scary story. One-time I left an upstairs window open while my family were away, I woke up to find my cat on my lap in a sort of ambush position, while also prodding me. Hear some noises in the hall way and on the stairs which run up the wall behind my bed. So I grab my hockey stick and charge out, now I'm like a 5,9 skinny white dude in boxers here. No sure who I was going to intimidate but then I see the rest of our cats all standing their ground together at the bottom of the stairs, in sort of cat wall formation.

I charge up the stairs, turns out there is another massive cat which isn't one of ours. In my still half asleep confused state I yell at it ""what are you doing here!"". Cat then legs it back out the window.

My cat saved me from a home invasion by another cat. 
 
Edit: Wow my first reddit gold! Thank you stranger! 

2nd edit: Sad news I'm afraid, on getting home tonight I have been informed the largest and oldest of the cats in the story, Cleo has been put down. She was a rescue cat and had a hard life but I know she enjoyed her later years. "
5,"Urine trouble.

edit: thanks you for the golds. its very nice."
6,just proved to your mom you are still her baby
7,man I always remember someone asking this in 5th grade sex ed and the teacher said it wasn't possible.
8,Definitely a strong bond you guys have. That's all I could focus on. 
9,"Yeah I gotta finish my dailies, collect 30 dicks"
10,That was actually quite ingenious of you to try to have fun. I can see how 7 year old you wouldn't see that blowing up in your face.
11,"Imagine if he saw this.

Waiting on that TIFU post from his view."
12,Yer too smart. We will ground you until yer dumb. 
13,"Even if he was 18, why on earth would you say little guy??"
14,"And this is why we should communicate in relationships, friends."
15,"Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is ""never get involved in a land war in Asia"" - but only slightly less well-known is this: ""Never go in against a 65-year-old woman when your grade is on the line""!

Edit: [Gold!?](http://i.imgur.com/pb4cy9G) Thank you kindly!"
16,A sex ed teacher said pissing with a boner is impossible? Sounds more than a little underqualified.
17,"""Whatcha doin?""

""Me? Oh just grinding on Grinder""

""Oh, okay"""
18,"I lost it at ""that's all for you babe"" "
19,"That sounds, or would have sounded, just as funny as the initial situation.  Reeeeeeet."
20,TL;DR: you have a really nice ass
21,I feel sorry for you but I kinda wish this was captured on video.
22,Marriage sounds weird.
23,"Was expecting you to catch him jacking off, good job keeping me on my toes"
24,You have been banned from /r/relationships
25,"""I'll just be grinding""... With no context? That could mean anything. I'm surprised no one asked a follow up question, about what exactly that entails. 

Either way, what game are you grinding in? It's been years since I've played a good grinding RPG"
26,"If you did it as hard as hard as it seems you could have broken her tail or fractured it.

Worth a trip to the vets IMO.

*edit* wow this comment blew up fast... The advice I've given is because if the cat was hiding for as long as op suggested (if the story is real) it could mean that's it's injured and hiding is a reaction to a painful injury as they know they're vulnerable.

Don't quote me on what I'm saying as fact, but as an animal lover and living with an almost 20 year old cat/seen other cat's reaction from being hit by cars that's what I think would explain the long hiding period.

*edit 2* Well I'm glad my now highest rated comment is providing helpful and fairly accurate knowledge to all!

*edit 3* just had a curious moment and checked u/steezykobe's history, 2 year club but no comment karma and only started posting last month... Hopefully he's just a bot building up karma in which case this story is likely fake and no cat was hurt, but don't let that stop with all these comment chain stories as i love reading about your cats/experiences."
27,i chuckled thanks lmao
28,"That's cute. They clearly look to you as their leader, just a giant, bald cat. "
29,"The breakfast is ready 

I went to his room 

To tell him to come down 

So we can eat soon 



I open the door 

And what do I see? 

My 15-year old bro

Right there on his knees 



I took a step back 

And slammed the door fast 

But I couldn't unsee

The brush stuck up his ass    "
30,"That happened to me aswell, but I didn't fade. I just panicked and an automatic cough saved me.


Never again."
31,You gotta stop getting down on one knee to break up with people 
32,Talk to her about it.
33,"My biology teacher said this in 9th grade.  I raised my hand and said: 

""Ms. Jury, you're incorrect.""

""No, I'm not.""

""Yes, you are.  I piss with an erection every morning.""

""You have an erection every morning???""

Yes, dumbass.  I'm a teenager.  My hormones are fucking RAGING.

She lost a bunch of my labs and made me redo them.  Then, when she lost them AGAIN, and tried to get me to redo them again, I refused.  She also called and left a message on a Saturday night at 10:30pm drunk as a fucking skunk about me not doing my homework and failing tests.

...it was two years after I was out of HS.

Edit:  My highest rated comment is about my old, gross biology teacher wanting my morning erections.  Greaaaaaat."
34,"So one time I was having a party with a lot of friends and family, and we were playing cards against humanity and my mom was playing with us. I forget what the subject card was but my mom played the queefing card. When I read it it didn't make any sense whatsoever, and then my mom was like ""yes it does! That's the game Harry Potter plays!"" I had to tell my mom ""no, that's quidditch. Queefing is a pussy fart...."" My mom's jaw dropped lol"
35,Before he leaves for school ask him if he made sure to brush.
36,"Haha I don't think he uses Reddit, but if he does, sorry bro! At least he remains anonymous. "
37,"Every night, right before I go to bed, I take my dog out to see if he has to do some business because being woken up in the middle  of the night sucks. 

Anyways, I always lock the door right after I take him out and head up to bed, so he knows the schedule by now. Last week, I forgot to lock the door, and he stood in the living room and barked at me until I did it. 

That dog is going to save my life some time."
38,Lpt if you work in any sort of service industry or sales positions don't use diminutive terms for young people or women. It comes off as patronizing and insulting.
39,"Judging from your wording, I thought that Henry was going to bond with you in another way."
40,"Dear God, that's disgusting.... Applebee's. *shudders*"
41,"I was just anxious the whole time, thinking you were gonna say you caused her to fall in the shower or something"
42,"I'm confused... you use a throw away account to throw your mates off your trail. You then procede to give enough information for anyone of your mates who reads this to have a pretty good idea its you. Do yourself a favor, don't become a criminal. You will be caught in seconds."
43,"Yeah, if this story is real, it's pretty messed up op got grounded. The letter had the most innocent intentions. And a 7 year old isn't going to know the implications of those actions. "
44,"These were never friends of yours. You even feel like you're in the wrong here while they've been terrible friends and bad roommates to you. It's no loss at all, and they got what they deserved. I feel like you should think long and hard about this because you will be walked over again if you actually feel guilty about this. "
45,"I think I tried to ~~lie about~~ deny sending it 

"
46,"Nah, GF is full of it.

Edit: Most karmerist thing I've ever done is a rando piss pun. We did it Reddit!"
47,You both are disgusting human beings. Congratulations on finding each other.
48,I feel like this shouldnt be as common as it seems to be 
49,"Maybe he accidently swallowed his toothbrush while brushing and it finally passed through his system.  He was just retrieving it when you walked in and the sobbing was him finally thankful that the ordeal was done.
Kind of like a toothbrush kidney stone...."
50,"""sleeping"" pfft, that cat was photocopying her ass for the alley cats annual party"
51,"TIL: if you want to be a child molester, make sure your handwriting looks like child wrote it.

52,SOMETIMES IT DOESNT CROSS YOUR MIND YOUR LITTLE BROTHER WILL BE FORCING ORAL HYGENE TOOLS UP HIS ASS WHEN YOU DO
53,"I kinda do too, thinking about it."
54,"Cats see people as big dumb kittens.

They lick you because they think you can't clean yourself.

They bring you dead and partially dead animals to teach you to hunt. 

I guess they recognize we're big though"
55,Likewise... if I pissed on my girlfriend I don't think it would end in laughter like that
56,Username farts out.
57,"His asshole is clean as a whistle, but his breath smells like shit. "
58,Best birthday gift ever!
59,"Had a friend in high school who could lay on her back and make her self queef. We were 14/15 and thought she was just making her self fart. My Aunt walked through the door as she was doing this and gave us the weirdest look and started laughing her ass off. When I asked what was so funny she said ""That's not farting girls, she's making her 'who-who'(my aunt doesn't like the word pussy) fart."" My friend got up and left real quick after that. The funny part was it was so loud! You could actually hear the air being sucked inside and then expelled. I still don't understand how my friend couldn't tell her ass from her pussy! "
60,"*&gt; while holding my stupid fucking glorious water bottle up toward the heavens*

this actually made me laugh out loud, well done."
61,She had a crush on you I know it 
62,"Had a friend who liked to huff gas. 

Had. "
63,"Well I guess now it's a $1,300 gaming PeeC

Wait also if you play Mei, just wait for your ult to charge, press Q, press Shift, go to the bathroom for 5 min, you should come back to easy SR and a POTG."
64,😉 that came in due time
65,Not the right kind of dough went into that oven
66,"""you dont talk, i dont talk"" Lol your teacher was like, fuck i aint got time for this shit"
67,It is likely that his mates already know the story - He just doesn't want his mates knowing his *real* reddit name
68,"I don't think this is our primary crime scene. It's too clean. You could even say... squeaky clean. 


Yeaaaah (•_•) ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■ (⌐■_■)"
69,"Well shit, it's definitely one of the biggest fuck ups I've seen on here. Well done."
70,There is a valve that closes during arousal to prevent this but it is definitely possible to force it with a lot of effort
71,Well I can't say it's much better...
72,Ungrateful bitch didn't even appreciate it.
73,If the firm continues internships I bet the first thing they touch on will be professionalism...
74,"Well, that *escalated* quickly..."
75,Yeah no shit ey. I died from this like 4 years ago. 
76,"Not a soul, she said. Of course no one on Reddit has one of those so..."
77,"Cards against humanity with moms is the most fun game ever!!! The student becomes the teacher, lesson one: fleshlights"
78,"&gt; I still don't understand how my friend couldn't tell her ass from her pussy!  

Pretty much sums up a lot of ""losing your virginity"" stories.

"
79,"Poor guy.

I don't think he would ever see his toothbrush the same again."
80,"Not really lol. Who's to judge if he likes butt stuff
"
81,So... No boyfriend yet?
82,I've heard Grindr is pretty good
83,OP is literally the reason others will sit through an extra hour of orientation.
84,Spare the toothbrush and just give him a dildo as a peace offering. 
85,"You probably run with your heels. Try landing more on your toes. 

Edit: I'm not much of a runner so don't look to me for advice on how to improve. I'm just going off stuff I've heard.  
But there have been some great replies to this comment so check them out!"
86,Lol! I don't think I'm going to mention that...
87,You didn't fuck up. The person who placed the ad without firing her did. 
88,"Haha I'll just leave him to his business, but I don't think the toothbrush was the traumatic part."
89,"Just think, people cheering on her break-up will be in her memory forever. "
90,"Invader kitty would've been like ""shit, this giant deformed baby is coming at me""

Edit: My highest rated comment is about a giant, deformed baby. Thanks Reddit"
91,"To everyone blaming the client for being so offended - it's his right whether or not he wants to do business with a firm. Honestly, why would I wanna buy a piece of estate from a firm worth $15 million that won't even treat its clients its respect? I'd rather just take it elsewhere lol - it's not like they're doing me a favor by selling it to me"
92,You should've went full commit with the whole naked thing. Make it as awkward as possible for all involved.
93,"I might recommend a slight change to your lesson of the day OP; cats are dickheads but they know the hand that feeds them 

Seriously though, that's scary as shit and I'm glad you and your family are OK. "

&gt;Marriage sounds weird"
95,At least your foot wasn't sucked in. There have been many brutal amputations/mutilations/deaths associated with escalators.
96,"Your last sentence reaffirms that you are a doormat. Reread your your entire post and than stop before the last sentence where somehow it all becomes your fault. Rethinking a situation to blame yourself is not healthy.

Your so-called ""friends"" are huge pieces of shit. They have zero respect for anyone other than themselves and deserve whatever they have coming to them. This is all a part of growing up. If they are real friends they will see their wrongdoing and apologize to you (just don't bank on it).

Move on with your life. You seem to have a much better head on your shoulders when it comes to life choices and keeping priorities straight, but for all that is holy please stop blaming yourself."
97,"Hey, maybe they just thought you'd be grinding on grinder."
98,Did you get her pregnant?
99,Manly Men Organizing Rough Penis Games 
100,Wait till you're married. Pee stuff happens. 
101,"&gt; Talk to her about it.

While this isn't r/relationships, *this* is the solution to 99.9% of all the posts there."
102,"Just last night my friend was telling me a story about how when he was a kid he chased his naked little brother around with a disposable camera. He was just trying to  torment him a little and thought hed use them to embarrass him for the coming years.

Well I guess Wal mart photo Centre didn't see the humour either. "
103,"Can you imagine someone coming to my body way later and trying CPR? They hear that ridiculous noise as they pump my chest. Reet, reet, reet. Breath!  But upon breathing into me they hear an equally funny sound. I'd have trouble as the EMT not laughing in my dead face."
104,"This is why I firmly believe some ways of dying can be laughed at. Hell, even you thought your method of near death was hilarious "
105,Does anyone believe this story? Girl cries because you farted? In your sexual prime but haven't experience a girl's vagina making a 'farting' noise?
106,"Her palms are sweaty, grip weak, balloon is heavy

There's helium in her windpipe already, sister's confetti"
107,I'd beg to differ... Guys masturbating is one thing but it's another to be ramming your own butt.
108,"That is brilliant. ""Sarah? Sarah? Oh nevermind guess she left already. "" keeping that one for next time. "
109,WHY DO PEOPLE OPEN DOORS WITHOUT KNOCKING
110,"Should've played it off like you thought your friend was there, but actually wasn't. "
111,"That comment put the pussy on the chainwax, take my fucking upvote"
112,I did this at Applebee's a few months back. Faded to black while the server and his trainee looked confused and my 10 year old cried. Hit a wall/floor and cleared my airway. I can't go back there anymore. 0/10 do not recommend.
113,Way better tl;dr haha
114,I guess you could say urine a bad situation
115,"My trouble is the treadmill isn't large enough for the cop to fit on it too, cuz getting chased is the only time I rev it higher than ""amble."" "
116,Not so much a valve as it is your prostate getting engorged and cutting off the urethra partially.
117,You have to be a special kind of stupid to post a job opening for a replacement and list the phone number to your company and said person is who answers the phone. Maybe you shouldn't work there.  
118,My mom googled bukkake...
119,That does change things. At least they didn't have waterboarding yet.
120,"Ugh this is indeed a FU. I have been to a property and treated like  a child, including being asked questions like ""are you sure you know what a mortgage is?"" It turned me completely off the potential purchase and I just turned on my heel and left. "
121,"Holy buttfucking dumpsterfires batman, what in the ever loving fuck was wrong with ""Good afternoon. How can I help you today?"""
122,"Okay that genuinely made me laugh out loud, thanks for that Shakespeare."
123,We found the brother...
124,"At first I read that like ""I'm only a child"" instead of ""I'm an only child"" and was so confused as to how you would be in your sexual prime at such a young age. "
125,TIL: I'm not the only one who did that when they were a kid.  
126,The other kids who cheated when all the teachers were busy surrounding you are probably very thankful to you that you wore that t-shirt.
127,"It's always a terrible idea to put harmful liquids in any other bottle than the original. People seem to do that a lot. (Why?)

129,It's the same thing.

132,"Instructions unclear, patient is a rubber duckie."
133,The mental image I have of this has me losing my shit in the office.

135,"They are morons, what was your alternative? To lie and/or promote smoking to cater to their delicate sensibilities?

141,"My mom got the ""Bukkake"" card and she got upset bc ""the company should put definitions on cards with foreign languages on them!"" We were all dying laughing but wouldn't explain to her what Bukkake was so for an hour she just kept shouting, ""what is Bukkake?!"""
142,"Yeah, just turn in the quest in the back, there."
143,"Ahh, fucking kids."
144,HOLD UP...HOLD UP. I just um googled 'pussy on the chainwax'. No results. I'm just sayin'. 'Pussy on the chaninwax' is not an expression.
145,OH
146,"My wife and I call that the Jetpack (she lets one loose while being the ""big spoon"").

Sometimes I don't hear it, but that chuckle is a dead giveaway... Then the smell hits and she yells, ""JETPACK!! IT'S TIME FOR BLAST OFF!!""

Damn, I love being married."
147,"This is one of those few acceptable FU's you can take in your life, I think. The kid was invariably going to hear about how bad smoking is from someone. Of course, it was you, an educator."
148,Mind blown. OP is a mastermind criminal.
149,To be fair it is quite a bit more adventurous. 
150,"Nothing like spooning and almost being asleep, to have your leg vibrating from their fart. Ahh the married life..."

152,If you black out you definitely got a serious concussion that you'll be noticing the effects of for months-years.  Please go to the doctor so you can keep doing stupid stuff to tell us about :) 
153,"An asshole and a pussy fart,

Are different things my dear,

Ignorance leads to knowledge,

So you don't need to fear,

By learning or experience,

We do know truths of life,

The former is the better one,

The latter comes with strife,

You may have farted in her face,

Kink often disappoints,

Atleast you have a tale to tell,

And score some pixel points.

154,I never understood this. You break-up in the restaurant. Then you finish eating as not a couple? That's a bit awkward. 
155,Don't use diminutive terms for people is a pretty solid rule in general. 
156,"No no, it turned out it wasn't a pedophile after all."
157,"Straightforward, I like it."
158,Know your audience and use vocab adapted

160,Not a bad idea.
161,Did she get.... pissed off?
162,"Honestly, the kid is going to have traumatic flashbacks of this every night before he falls asleep for the rest of his life. The only way to counteract it is to send him a photo of yourself, with a toothbrush up your butt.

165,[deleted]
166,Ewwwww.  Well it was definitely not mutual. 
167,"To be fair, with a 15 year old boy in the house you should probably have assumed that 99% of the time when his door is closed he's doing something you may not want to think about or see.

But...you taught him a valuable lesson about keeping the door *locked* that 99% of the time."
168,"Congrats. Not only did you injure yourself for a joke, you injured yourself for one of the worst jokes I've ever had to read."
169,Let's just hope he uses different brushes... I wouldn't want to handle something frequently that I also stick up my ass.
170,"Lol please tell that to these ""geniuses"" that are claiming that they're sure he's gay."
171,"Mate, get that checked out!"
172,a little BACKstory for you
173,"Wow, very scary indeed. Glad everything ended up working out and that cat should get some extra treats! I had something similar happen. We have a dog run on the side of our house, completely fenced in with no gate to the fence, the only way into/out of the run is by an actual door on the side of our house. We rarely lock it as someone would have to fight their way through the tree line that runs along the run and then climb a 6 foot fence and then come in all without my very large dog noticing and alerting us...impossible, right? Nope. The door in question is in a playroom we dedicated to our kids. One night, I'm walking over their sleeping bags (fake sleepover that they just had to have) and letting the dog out to do his business. As I open the door, I am face to face with someone. They dog took off after them and I proceeded to scream like a banshee. They were caught, however, bc they broke their arm trying to get through the treeline and confessed to the ER nurse. Scary stuff. Now it's locked and we put a security light out there too. "
174,Fart stuff as well. Me and my wife regularly fart on each other
175,"Holy crap dude, it might be an idea to inform authorities on this location because it looks like a custom built prison at home of some sorts.

Thanks for the warning mate, I'll keep this in mind forever *brr*"
176,something something broken arms 
177,You should seriously pull her out from the couch and check her tail. You may have to take her into the vet. 
178,"Played Cards Against Humanity with my sons and their friends: 15, 16, 17 &amp; 18.  One of them plays a queef card and they all cackle wildly, high fiving and general ""bruh""ing all around.  So, being a terrible, evil mom, I ask, ""do any of you actually know what that means?""  The table gets immediately quiet and they all glance at each other and the table and the ceiling.  Then my youngest, practically whispers, ""please, mom, no"".  I then say, ""Well, since you all find it so hilarious, it's probably time you understand about females"" and I proceed to verbally eviscerate them with knowledge they never wanted to have.

That was an awesome game.  Good times."
179,"""And not locking the door"""
180,Didn't everyone have a vacant mansion for sex with hot college girls when they were 18?  
181,Sounds like he just did. Maybe he's from the future and in another universe he didn't bark at you to lock the door and you got killed by an axe murderer because of it.
182,Suuuuure. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
183,"Why did you think she would like this. Even if she farted, that does not mean she did it intentionally or she likes to be FARTED IN THE FACE."
184,Slam his dick into the corner of a table. Go to hospital and send pics for proof. That is a real TIFU.
185,"It's scary, but better to know and catch something early than pretend nothing is wrong. Hell, it's probably nothing or an easy fix. But either way it's better to go get it checked my friend.


Do me a favor, get an appointment setup now, not tonight, not in the morning... Schedule it now. Please, for your faceless, likely a bot internet bud. Beep boop, go my friend."
186,"Dude, you've got a problem here OP. IMHO, marriage is a team sport, particularly when neither one of you is loaded."
187,"So true. 

People in higher positions than me always say ""hun"" and ""dude"" to customers. So unprofessional and they always get called out ""youre young enough to be my son"".

"
188,"What is up my negros, how is it hanging?"
189,"This is... This is truly brutal OP :-( I'm very sorry, stay strong!


BTW, did you at least find the 100 bucks? It would be of little to no consolation of course, but still..."

191,"If their own family isn't giving them a second chance, that should tell you something."

""Probably just some grinding""

What? Who says that? I play video games and know the term and still wouldn't know wtf someone was talking about if they just said they were ""grinding"". "

208,Nope. You def gotta run on your toes

214,"I usually read these gross-yet-oddly-cute stories and think, *That's the kind of relationship I want.*

Not this time. "
215,"You only say an when using it before a word starting with a vowel, and use a any other time. Like this: An antelope, an earing, an otter.. A restaurant, a proposal."

The deadliest of formations."
218,"your whole story above is nice and all.

but, assuming it's true...you fucked up by not going to the bathroom after you got off the plane/train/bus before even heading home...

thus, leading me to believe that either you're dumb, or the story above isn't true."
219,"Message him saying, ""it's only a joke mate.. not a penis, don't take it so hard."" problem solved."
220,"Wait... The handle was up his ass? 

THAT'S NOT HOW YOU CLEAN AN ASSHOLE, AT ALL!"
221,"The fact that you would address anyone who is clearly in their teenage years as 'little guy' says alot about your character. 18, 21, 15, 35 it doesn't matter, for fuck sake don't address someone as 'little guy' ESPECIALLY when you're in a professional setting."
222,Did you know that sometimes sloths fall out of trees and die because they grab their own arm thinking it's a branch?
223,Wow that is the dumbest thing I have heard in a long time
224,Rip jonpcr931...
225,Next time?! 
226,"Feels good, according to my gf. We don't do it often, for risk of infection, but... sometimes...  

**Edit:** For those asking about infection in relation to urine being sterile: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/turns-out-urine-isnt-actually-sterile-180954809/

Even with it not being sterile, the bigger problem is that in more sensitive areas of the body, like the vagina or up da butt, there is a delicate balance of good bacteria and other things that helps keep things clean and operating properly. Disrupting this balance can lead to infections and other problems, which is why women shouldn't douche much, or at all unless necessary, or use too much soap or other hygiene products down there (even if they claim to be good for the area). Same with the butt with whatever gender, but less people shoot soap and other disrupting things up there.

227,For a 15 year old a toothbrush might be easier to hide.

230,"In my mind, the people knew it was a breakup, but they all thought she was a shitty person and just enjoyed watching her cry. "
231,"Seriously, it's just a mean thing to do. People do it, because they think it's a good way to avoid anyone making a scene. "
232,"Or just in general. 

Who the fuck calls a complete stranger ""little guy?""

"
233,"Translation for the out-of-tune: ""Why the fucking hell would you let the donkey put his two foot long penis inside your asshole?!?!""

You're welcome. "
234,No that would have been an abortion. 
235,Could have just spit on the food like a normal asshole. Instead you had to be a dumb asshole. Honestly though you majorly fucked up
236,Fairly sure waterboarding was invented before 1997
237,Whoa wtf bro I think I have prostate issues then... like I've avoided reading about this on purpose but that literally sounds exactly like what mine feels like (my urethra I mean). Sometimes I know I got more piss in there but it's just like it get closed off or something.
238,Checking out checks out.
239,I died more of the thought that 1998 was 18 years ago... 
240,"Lmao, you even warmed it up in the microwave"

243,"Broken tails are generally treated by letting the cat rest and pain meds, but if the nerve is damaged causing lack of sensation and the tail drags on the ground, amputation is often necessary. Early treatment can prevent that, sometimes"
244,"To be fair, if a problem can't be solved by talking and then leads to a break up it kind of became the solution.
Not a happy ending straight away but may enable those parties to find a truer happiness down the line.

Your sentiment is correct - but if two people are that disconnected then it's probably not a healthy relationship"
245,"I have to say, life is somewhat easier since I got comfortable with silence."
246,That's not fair at all. You should go talk to someone about being able to take the exam again. 
247,"Sore neck, and feelings now, neat."
248,That is a 6 page report and a bitching at about liability. Ain't nobody got time for that. My gym teacher used to tell us that if we were going to get injured do him the courtesy of dying because it is less paper work.

Negative of wan?
Wan not?"
250,He can deffinetly be a dick head. But just glad I didn't fight with my partner to stay in bed could have gotten a lot more than my empty wallet hahaha 
251,I mean it's a type of masturbation... just not the everyday kind.
252,Hope you gave that mother fucking homie a treat!

264,I think he gets that now
265,The girl who wrote that out was a bitch for that move. 
266,"When I went to do the paperwork to sell my house one of the office women commented to my realtor ""I didn't know 16 year olds were buying and selling homes"" after seeing me. Bitch, I was 29. I wish she had said it to my face so I could shame her in front of her coworkers."
267,Because you couldn't reach his face?
268,JRHNBR? 
269,"You, sir, deserve way more points for that comment."
270,"I mean, it IS Japanese..."
271,Dry. I like it.
272,That's true. I felt a little bad and laughed a little is all
273,OP was an idiot. Posting in TIFU is exactly for admitting idiocy. He's a college intern and learned a valuable lesson. Cheers on OP for recognizing the fault and learning from it. 
274,"""fuckin animals"""
275,"Yeah, just local police and PTA members weren't allowed to do it back then."
276,"I knew it.

One day, maybe a decade from now.  You will be happy and content.  You will have a spouse, you might have kids.  A dog, I see a dog, definitely a dog.

And the house, you are a homeowner.  You got shit that needs fixed.  You have no clue what you are doing but you fake it and hope for the best.

You will look back at this and when you do you will see something with absolute clarity.

God himself traded that $100 bill for that picture.  It was the best $100 you will spend in your entire life.  

A bullet was dodged.  No woman that gets pregnant with another mans baby then gets a secret abortion is worth keeping.

My friend, to say leaving was the correct decision is an incredible understatement.

There will come a point where she says she just wants to stay friends for emotional support.  (I know these people like the back of my hands)

Understand something.  She has plenty of people for that already.  Family.  Friends.  Those people that she confided in that kept this secret from you - she can get emotional support from those people.  She has no need from you.

Leave.  Block her phone number on your phone.  Tell Gmail to send her address to the trash when it gets incoming mail.  Be done.

You will do better.

279,Henry got mad that I didn't let him Into the chicken pen and when I came out he kicked me. Left a welt of his hoof print for a few days. Everyone has there days so I'm not mad at him 
280,Call the police non emergency number for the precinct of the air b&amp;b and explain the situation and your concerns. I suggest non emergency since this call may take a while to explain.

282,"If anyone is interested in reading into this and running in general, I highly suggest the book Born To Run. It's interesting and funny and discusses why people who run heel -&gt; toe suffer more injuries than any other athletes (at the time that it was published)."
283,I really hope you got them evicted because these people deserve to see their faults. I hope you meet better people soon!

285,"This is why I despair at American issues.

Instead of a doctor giving you a $100 arse fingering, you'll end up costing the country thousands of dollars in Medicare cover from your prostate cancer.

This, ladies and gentlemen is why it's actually cheaper to offer free, universal cover."
