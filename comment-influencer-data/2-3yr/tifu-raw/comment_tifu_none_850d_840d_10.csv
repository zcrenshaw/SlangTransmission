0,Secret Service into headset: I really scared the hell out of a kid lol.
1,"Another agent replies: ""Savage, lol. Over."""
2,"Well, that's what happens when you don't train your staff."
3,I love how you just decided to have a nap
4,I love the bit where your wife tries to mail back your degree because you decided to go all WWI on them
5,"21 seems a bit old to have a clown performing at her birthday party, but at least you delivered."
6,"""Look at my new bayonet! Does a great job penetrating"""
7,"Sir, if you read that comment again, I believe you will find that you have been burnt."
8,Own up to it. Your parents will be happier that you were honest with them rather than trying to hide it from them and they figure it out some other way.
9,"Good story. 

I've always wanted to tell this tale on reddit, and this is probably as good a place as any.

Back in 2009, my Wife and I were on Capitol Hill for a rally. We had been there for several hours, and wanted to refresh our weed buzz. We moved across the lawn to a large bush away from everyone, and proceeded to puff away in the shade. 

We started discussing how many people were there, the security on the rooftops watching over, and whether they had people in the crowd undercover...Generally just making jokes and wisecracking as you do. I said to my Wife, ""Haha, they probably have a sniper in this bush!"".

Directly behind us, in the bush, came a soft, throat-clearing cough. We both instantly froze, apologized to the bush for the smoke in the air, told it to have a nice day, and got the heck out of there.

 Edit: I just wanted to add (Since I have mentioned being a parent) that this was three years before our first child was born, and we had ceased our awful, sinful ways before he was born. I'm still paranoid, and don't want a knock from CPS. Haven't touched the stuff in a loooong time. However, the moment they are adults and it is decriminalized in our state (It will by then), I will certainly be taking a nice long toke. "
10,"Was CT searching for trauma, or just presence of brain activity?"
11,"But still. I've never been on a date and thought, ""well this isn't going well, guess I'll have a snooze"""
12,[deleted]
13,"Yeah, while this was OPs fault at the base level, fundamentally their boss should have not let them use the system solo 

Edit: also that's a basic travel package? The fuck? "
14,"Lol. She's literally a ""helicopter mom""
"
15,"This is as good a place as any for my secret service story.  I was in highschool and was chosen to be in the group of students standing behind Bill Clinton for one of his re-election speeches. As i was in the secret service pat-down line, i realized my keychain in my pocket mayyyy have raised some red flags. It was a 5""long metal bar with finger grooves and a tapered end, known as a fist-pack. 

As i got up to the first secret service agent, i put my hands up and told him he wasn't going to like my keychain. Lol. He asked to see it, i showed him and he just shook his head and said nope. I took it off the keyring and turned it over to him, it was only 8$. But then he told me to find him afterwords, i did, and he returned it to me after Clinton got in his limousine.  I have a weapon thats been in possesion of the secret service!  

"
16,"Could be worse. I once observed Obama through a rifle scope. It wasn't attached to a rifle, but I didn't realize how stupid it was until I was already doing it. He was giving a speech across the street from my place and I wanted to see him getting into his car. So, looking from the window in my closet I use my rifle scope, as I didn't have binoculars. A few seconds in, it dawns on me what I'm doing. I'm lucky I wasn't shot by a sniper. 

edit: Jesus. I grilled myself and my girl a few burgers...

Anyway, Obama was at the Oregon Convention Center and I lived in NE 1st at the time (Syringe Court). And I did indeed see the man from a rifle scope. I regret that, didn't mean to do it, I'm not a danger to either Mr. Obama or Trump, just that it happened. "
17,"I can't even blame her.  That's, like, chemistry 101."
18,"Setting up a client on one of your first days without supervision? That one's on management, mate. They were takin a piss or wot?"
19,"Can confirm there will never be a bill for Coast Guard search and rescue services. Your federal tax dollars pay for it.

Source: am Coast Guard helicopter pilot, assigned to Miami unit that searched for you last night. Glad you two were alright.

Edit: I don't Reddit good, 'cause I didn't see this blowing up. Sorry to leave everyone hanging overnight. As excited as I was to read this TIFU (because us operators never get the full story on these things, even after the fact), I hit reply and went to sleep since I was the one on duty last night--and you never know when you'll get called out at 2300 for a couple missing 20 year olds, amirite OP??

About ""sleeping on duty:"" A crew is on watch for 24 hours but we have bunk rooms to sleep in, not unlike firefighters. Still on duty, but will try to answer questions and PMs by the end of today.

To clarify: I wasn't the pilot looking for OP, my buddy was. I'm the one that took the watch from him yesterday morning, but you can bet your bottom dollar I'm showing him this post when he comes in this morning.

For those asking if it's a good job: it is, and it's rewarding, but it *is* a job, so don't kid yourself--there's still some bullshit that comes with the territory, but by and large I'm happy in my career.

For those calling bullshit on this post, standby for proof.

Edit2: Proof. http://imgur.com/a/1CdDC
And before you say it's not a Coast Guard H-65 because it's not all orange, this one is painted white with orange trim (retro colors as it was painted in the 80s) in celebration of the Centennial of Coast Guard Aviation. This is the exact helo (we have 5 at the unit) that searched for OP!"
20,"My man, what did you eat so I know to avoid?"
21,"everytime I read ""almost killing"" in the TIFU people used bleach the wrong way."
22,I want this to be what happened.
23,The whole time I was waiting for this girl to leave you stranded or rob you because you wouldn't bang her.
24,"""Dipstick"" is such a fitting insult for one working in the automotive industry. "
25,[deleted]
26,"That's a great TIFU.  Once enough people stop shooting and the range gets quiet; everyone looks to see what's going on. I can imagine people walking up asking others what was going on.

I wouldn't be surprised if you hear the story at another range a few years from now.

Edit, I was going to leave the typo. But I couldn't take the pressure. I'm sorry"
27,"That's the ""fuck don't sue us"" package"
28,Your determination is awesome! And fuck stinkbugs
29,to see if my skull cracked and bleeding into the brain. (I think..I'm a finance guy not a doctor so I'm not sure but I think that is what it was for)

32,What a maroon.
33,"At what point do you just buy a new place, because it's less stressful?"
34,"Dammit you're an engineer, not a chemist!"
35,I couldn't even tell you at this point. I believe the real catalyst was I skipped a couple days of fiber gummies.
36,"Maybe the fact that you spent $2000 more than you thought was in your bank account indicates you should be checking your account balance.

37,Holy shit. Gave me anxiety just reading that lol
38,That's what they bought to make up for screwing up the basic package. So 15k is not the basic.
39,Your baby brothers name is Mom?
40,"Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor. But ... every once in a while... it's a dildo. Of course, it's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. We have to use the indefinite article, ""a dildo"", never ... your dildo."
41,"This was just an honest mistake, tell them as soon as possible and they'll understand. You don't have any other options though so just don't fuck it up further! "
42,Flood it with water to rinse everything you can.
43,TFW he's a chemical engineer ....
44,"Actually when I was seven years old, my baby brother, Mom, and I were standing in a line to shake Clinton's hand. The Secret Service saw us being partially obscured by all the other people, and pulled us out of the line and brought us to the end out in the open so that Clinton could have a nice photo op with us. He shook my hand and held my brother and kissed him on the head."
45,"Aww, at least your fuckup was the highlight of someone else's day."
46,Finished and she hasn't? -sleep

51,She's packing.

53,dude...you had me...don't
54,As a 41 year old male... i can attest: do not miss fiber any day. Also never leave a toilet clogged. 
55,"A long time ago, my father saw a ""Do not mix with bleach"" warning label on a bottle of ammonia. Obviously, he had to try it out and see for himself what would happen. He realized pretty quickly what he had just made, quickly opened the bathroom window, and ran out the door closing it behind him."
56,"A couple of years back I cost my company 6k. It was entirely my fuckup. 
Pale-Faced and a little shaky I went to my boss and told him about it. Then he looked at me, smiled and said ""Congratulations and welcome to the club. My first fuckup cost the company 45k, so yours is pretty cheap. I'm sure you will learn from it and never do it again.""
And that was that. I'm very sorry that not all bosses are like that.

Edit: terrible typo"
57,"Your determination to write your post. You know with the Haiku, and Wikipedia link."
58,"But you've already posted this, OP. Don't you remember?"
59,"My wife woke me up really damn early one morning when we were camping by a lake to tell me my sailboat had drifted off during the night. When she asked what I was going to do about it it told her ""Go back to sleep and figure it out later."" Got up a couple hours later, and fully rested, to go get the boat. Was at the south end of the lake so I just sailed it back. 

Moral of the story: Sometimes you just need to sleep on it. "

66,"Insurance claim.

My buddy had a leaky toilet valve (toilet would refill itself sometimes) and a big burrito-size toilet clog that was left there overnight.  By the time they figured it out, poo-water was soaked into the carpets, flooring and drywall.

Cost over $30k to fix.  Insurance paid  Anything that got wet had to be replaced for biohazard reasons.  All new carpets on top floor, all new floorboards and all new drywall on the bottom floor ceilings."
67,"I mean if there was an award for tifu

It's like you want to laugh but inside like this poor man I am quite literally dying inside for him

That is like the ultimate in tifu bad luck Brian day week life "
68,"Can't see how you're at fault here, really. 

Did anyone :

* properly guide you through the system? 

* tell you about important stuff regarding the software?

* revisit your early transactions?

I'd bet they just gave you a quick 5 minute ""this is how it works"" and then left you on your own. Company got what it deserved."

74,"Lmao! Your description of Obama's interaction with the Secret Service was hilarious.

It was the presidential equivalent of ""Sorry guys, my mom says I can't come out to play."""
75,"In the future, double ziplock your phone and take it with you. Also, listen to your gut. Our subconsious minds pick up on stuff you don't immediately think about, so if something seems off, it probably is."
76,Well the solution here is obvious. Give him chicken nuggets in the shape of an animal he hates instead. Then he'll cheer when you cut them up and everyone's happy. 
77,"*Guy continuously muttering ""This isn't in my job description""*


Edit: My top comment is now about a disgruntled handyman cleaning liquefied excrement out of a stranger's basement. "
78,"If it makes you feel any better it's extremely unlikely that you were the cause of him leaving. If you worried them enough to warrant making him leave they would have done it immediately, not after he signed your ticket. 

It's more likely that it was just time for him to go and it was the Secret Service that told him his scheduled time was up for that event. "
79,Seeing a $30k tag put on a similar situation really hammers home just how badly I'm gonna need professionals to solve all of this.
80,"I laughed, my wife laughed, the bush laughed, we shot the bush."
81,"I was hoping you meant that and not to eat the stinkbug.

That thing was promptly spatted onto the floor with a single and sudden (albeit loud) utterance of ""FUCK"".

85,"Do you have to pay for search and rescue operations when something like that happens?

86,Again
87,"Sweden is a lot smaller than the US, but our ministers have bodyguards as well. When I went to uni I helped organize a speech our Minister of Finance gave at our uni. After the event we who helped organize it got to take a photo with him. Only that was not the only event taking place that day that we were organizing, so I had to leave briefly to go get something for the next event. When I came back to the venue as they were letting people out the bodyguards didn't want to let me in. They found it suspicious that I would want to get (back) in just as the speech/Q&amp;A was ending. I had to show them my ID and student ID and answer a bunch of random questions about what the guy had said during his speech to show that I really was one of the organizers and was supposed to be there for the photo. Like, it's great that you're careful, but you didn't search me. In fact nobody who attended got searched or had to go through security of any kind, nor show identification. There was no reason to get hyper vigilant after the event when there was zero security up until that point."
88,Nah.  In the US we just drag you out by your feet.  THAT'S economical.
89,Absolutely this. If you think it will harm the plants just flood them. Since they are in pots the excess water can drain and wont kill the plants. Diluting the solution should solve the problem due to plants having very limited time to soak it up. Also may want to watch the drain water and grab a PH test kit just to make sure you didn't screw the PH of your soil. 
90,"I've worked with Secret Service agents before. They take the security of their protectees *super* seriously, but other than that they can be some of the friendliest people you'll meet."

95,"It's ok because it was a tactical dildo, with the red light and everything"
96,"I'd like it to be too, but this was about seven years before ""savage"" entered common slang usage.


...I suppose we can reconcile this with the theory that the secret service is responsible for slang. 

Headcanon: Whenever a teenager hears an operative use a cool-sounding codeword, they start spreading it, then the official codeword changes and the operative is fired."
97,"Don't worry, I did this same thing when doing laundry. I was determined to make my whites as fresh and white as possible, so why not add bleach AND vinegar to really amp it up?

My boyfriend was not happy. He took the dog for a walk while I called poison control to see if we were going to die."

112,Remindes me of a schoolmate. Had an internship and they gave him full access to the customer data. Idk how but he managed to delete the whole database and they had... 0 backups. So all the data that gathered over decade's just blew up in dust. Because the Internship had been organized by the school the school insurance paid a few thousand bucks compensation... But who the fuck would let a teen work on such data and why would any serious business not have backups of everything? The fuck up was not only on his side imo.
113,"I don't know, I'd say walking around wearing flammable pants might be considered a health and safety violation in almost any circumstances."

121,Very economical. 
122,"He didn't sign the ticket though, I had to extend my arm as far as it would just to shake his hand. The whole situation had a ""its safer if he leaves"" kinda vibe. But who knows? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
123,"&gt; I laughed, my wife laughed, the bush laughed, we ~~shot the bush~~ got shot by the bush.

124,"They have the authority to use lethal force on an individual basis. It's the agent's call unless they're specifically told otherwise, either to shoot or not to shoot, and they can even override if they feel it's necessary. Of course, they have to explain their actions afterwards, but they have a lot of leeway in terms of prosecution, it might not save their career or keep them from getting fired if they fuck up."
125,You must have a super chill subconscious. 
126,I'm the head attendant on this particular helicopter. Basically my job is to dab the sweat off the pilots foreheads when they are doing difficult manoeuvres.

I went to see Biden in 2014 during a speech and I had a bit of metal in me from an operation.  The moment I stepped through the metal detector I had three secret service around me asking me to step aside.  After very carefully explaining what had set off the detector, they used a handheld scanner that I assume is more precise, verified my claims, and let me through.  But damn if they weren't very serious for that minute where they didn't know what I had on me."
134,Honestly the guy doesn't sound too much fun either.
135,"And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married... But then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll, I'll, I'll set the building on fire..."

Or you could just explain what happened and promise to pay them back. "
165,Tell her it's some funny shit. 
166,"This is actually true. It's a little-known fact that the secret service started the whole dabbing thing: they have a secondary comms system with microphones built into their inner elbows, which they use exclusively for ordering prostitutes when they're on location.

This is not something you are capable of cleaning on your own. The carpet and drywall that were affected need to be REMOVED. The carpet padding is fucked. You need anti microbial treatment and the fact that it's in your air ducts is a SERIOUS risk and you need to call a nadca approved tech out to clean them. I'd call your insurance. 
177,During my trip to DC we were told no to lean on the fence of the White House because a few years prior one of out teachers did and a secret service gaurd in the bush popped out and scarred her for a good chuckle.
178,"I, too, am very interested. Please deliver, OP. "
179,Thanks Obama

181,"It's amazing the way they can shift from ""do i need to put you down?"" to ""hey buddy, sorry for the delay have fun!"" in the blink of an eye once they verify that you're not a threat. And you can feel it even if they don't say a word, from behind dark sunglasses."
182,"My company has the mentality that employees are GOING to screw up - because they're, you know, human - so take every opportunity as a training experience. If someone were to make a $15k mistake, they become $15k more valuable to the firm. In other words, the firm just invested $15k to train you, firing you at that point would be counterintuitive. It's obviously not carte blanche to be careless and make unnecessary mistakes, but it does create an environment of ""ok I can take this risk because the company has my back."" "
183,"&gt;Tifu by *not* wanting to be a dick...

I mean, taking a nap on a date is something I'd consider to be being a dick, lol. 

""Yeah, this date sucks, wake me up in a few hours, will ya?"" 

Haha, what was that poor girl supposed to do? Two people alone on an island and one takes a nap. That's so awkward. "
184,Really wanna see an f16 escort a hot air balloon now.

187,Sounds more like a carefully orchestrated insurance fraud.
188,"That's what many people might not realize, the Secret Service guys in suits are only half of the security detail, also from what 
I hear they are usually pretty nice if you are actually talking with them, kind of a PR type thing

189,I have yet to read something about stomach ache and wanting to clean the stomach from the inside with bleach. 
190,"Dammit, so late to the party, but here's my secret service story. 

I grew up in Manhattan, and when I was a teenager  I would bike all over the city. This particular day I was around the UN building and there was some sort of summit there. Not a big deal but made traffic a nightmare for cars. 

Well,  I was biking down a main thoroughfare and even though technically bikes can't go the opposite direction down one way streets, no one ever obeys that law. I turn of the main avenue and onto a side street gong the wrong way. The only cars are 5 black suvs. I, of course, was wearing my dark jeans, a back hoodie, and a messenger bag. As soon as I pass the first SUV, doors start opening, and about 6-7 dudes jump out, guns drawn and order me to stop and get down on the ground. 

for that moment,  I was the mother fucking usain bolt of getting off bikes. They checked my bag and let me go. And I learned to not ride my bike around the UN building when foreign leaders are in town. "
191,"So I live in DC. When friends and family come to visit they want to do all the touristy stuff. Naturally, that includes going by the White House. We were there at some point last summer with my girlfriend's family. Her mom was walking along close-ish to the front fence, and a secret service agent walks out from behind a tree and shouts directly at her/us ""HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DID YOU JUST TRY TO JUMP THE FENCE?"" We all froze immediately. After about 2 seconds he slowly cracked a huge ear to ear grin and said calmly ""I'm just messing around with you guys. Keep moving please.""

I'm still not sure if he was actually messing around or if we were really too close to the fence, but I'm not kidding when I say that that moment might be the closest I have ever come to spontaneously shitting my pants."
192,What is up with that persons foot.
193,I was more shocked at the part where he saw his girlfriend crying thinking she was dying and his reaction was to drink himself to sleep.
194,"60 ppm of chlorine gas is considered to be fatally toxic. You mix a 1 to 1 solution of acetic acid and sodium hypochlorite in water. Assuming 10% relative humidity and 90 degrees F ambient temperature, how much of this solution will it take to kill 4 people and a dog in a 200 cubic meter enclosed space? Show your work. lol"
