29,"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that while it is tough, your life isn't over. Many people will sympathize (as you have seen here) with your situation and will even go out of their way to defend you.

I am a registered sex offender for indecent exposure more than 25 years ago. I was messed up at the time but spent years in therapy and got my life in order. Unfortunately, then the registry came along. I was able to get off it, but then the laws changed and I will now be on it for life. I often feel deep pain for my situation but there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. I am married and have kids so I not only feel pain for myself but for how they also have to pay for what I have done. I really was guilty, but I am far from that person I was 25 years ago, but that will never make a difference. 

But I learned that much of my pain comes from myself. I had put myself down and imagined that everyone around me looked at me as a monster. The thing is, that is my choice to feel that way. I can also choose not to give a fuck and not be hurt by something I cannot change. My confidence and the person I am does affect the way other people treat me.

Look at Trump. He is accused of all kinds of stuff, much of which is true. But no one can hurt his candidacy because he simply doesn't care what people say. Even a small fraction of the things that have come up would have knocked any other candidate out of the race long ago. 

So stop killing yourself over this, you simply cannot change it. Accept it as part of your past, but refuse to let it define who your future. Say these words often: *I refuse to let my past define who I am*. You will always have fleeting moments of pain, guilt, or shame, but you can choose to not dwell on those feelings. 

Look, many people have to deal with things that have ruined their lives. I know someone who backed over their own toddler and killed him. I know people who have permanently injured other people because they chose to drive drunk. This whole subreddit is about people who fucked up. You made a bad legal decision but it was the best you could do at the time with what you had. At least you know you aren't guilty and don't have to carry that around with you. 

You can find love. You can have children. You can find ways to make money. I am somewhat known as an expert in my field but I won't ever be able to get a job in it. I had to start my own business and find other ways to make money over the internet. It is frustrating and it is hard, but it is doable. 

Be a good man. Help other people out and have integrity. Be aware of those people around you who might be silently hurting and just need kindness from a stranger; people are hurting everywhere. Volunteer your time for a cause that is important to you. If nothing is important to you, figure out how to make something important to you. 

But most importantly, refuse to let yourself be hurt one more day by this."

31,"My significant other is in a similar boat. SOR laws are shit. 

Rape conviction at age 12 for ""penetrating"" another girl. Class A felony. She didn't do anything, and took a plea bargain at the advice of her lawyer to avoid serious jail time and the lawyer said she could get it expunged in 2 years, but that was a lie. Washington state doesn't automatically hide juvenile records either. Its been on her record for over 15 years now.

Turns out the girl's dad was the one touching the girl (he got arrested a year later) and she pinned it on my SO because she was scared.

SO got married (to someone else), had kids, then divorced. Of course the ex used the prior conviction against her. She lost custody of her kids and it haunts her every day.

79,"Found an answer on reddit (credit to /u/krieksie) to this question from 2 years ago (long read): 

Exothermic reactions take place when more energy is created in the system, than absorbed into the system.

The chemical reaction takes place between the builder ingredient, and the water, also producing a gas as a by-product in the process.

If you pour the powder into the water, you don’t really feel or see the reaction taking place, because of your water to detergent ratio.  You can see small bubbles coming up and forming at the top of the water, but it takes a while, and it’s not a lot.  You can feel the reaction a lot better if you pour 25ml of powder in your hand, and drip a little water into it until you have a thick paste. (most chemistry teachers, dermatologists, and somatologists would advise you not to handle chemicals with your hands, and I wouldn't suggest taking a bath in this paste, because its not exactly fantastic for your skin or health)  If you take the time to look, you’ll see bubbles forming and a lot of hollow spaces in your paste (like larger bubbles).  This is where the resultant gas is escaping from the system.  This gas probably also have a function in entire system, probably antibacterial, or in some way moving through the water and fabrics in their eternal struggle to the top for air, and thus helping to loosen dirt and soil.  I'm not sure.  By this time the entire paste is also warmer than it used to be.  But another thing you'll notice, is that after a while the temperature drops again.  This is because the reaction has completed.  All the new bonds that could form has been formed, and the extra energy has been spent as heat, and no new energy is being released.

**If you only wanted to know the basics of why the laundry detergent heats up, you can stop here.  If you want more info, keep reading.**

Ok so we’ve got 15 possible ingredients in a single product.  Not all of them will be in all detergents, that will depend on the manufacturer. But we have 15 categories of typical laundry detergent ingredients:
Surfactants, Builders, Alkalis ,Anti re-deposition agents ,Enzymes, Active oxygen bleaches, Antimicrobial agents, Fabric softeners, Fragrances, Optical brighteners, Preservatives, Hydrotropes, Processing aids, Foam regulators, Corrosion inhibitors.

For the purpose of this question, the two most important parts are the surfactants and the builders, since they work together.

**Surfactants:**

These are the active cleaning agents.  They have three roles that they perform:  penetrating and wetting the fabric, loosening soils, and lastly, emulsifying soils and keeping them suspended in the wash solution.
The basic idea behind this is, polar substances interact very good with other polar substances, and vice versa.

Surfactants look like tiny little sperm.  They have a head and a tail.  The head, is hydrophilic, and also polar.  Literally meaning, it loves water *(and suddenly -philic becomes a very interesting suffix..)*.  The tail, on the other hand, is hydrophobic (and non-polar).  It hates water.  The head, due to its incredible love for water (also a polar substance) connects to the water, while the tail tries to get as far away from it as possible, connecting to the fabric.

So as soon as the detergent, fabric, and water are in the mix together, the surfactant connects the water to the fabric, allowing it to clean (there is some more science behind this, I’ll give you a link at the bottom of the page).


**Builders:**

These little guys are the supporting actors in the story, supporting the action of the surfactant.  They soften water, help disperse soils, prevent their redeposition out of our complete solution, and they also provide **alkalinity**.  This helps to remove oil based stains.

Naturally in water, we find positively charged metal ions.  Cations.  Calcium and magnesium concentrations in the water (2 cations) determine how hard the water is.  Both of these are present in our water, and both of these counteract the goal of washing clothes (they do nasty stuff like binding with the soap to to fix dirty spots to your clothes), as they hinder the action of the surfactants.  Now our lovely little builders come into the picture.  They form a complex binding with the calcium and magnesium, basically to keep them busy while the surfactant does its work.  This stops the cations from interfering in the working of the system, and also immediately softens the water (I’ll leave you a link to the definitions of hard and soft water as well).

**NOW:**

One of the most common ingredients in laundry detergent is sodium carbonate.  This is a *precipitating* builder.  What this means, is that sodium carbonate is water soluble, but only until they form a complex binding with the calcium and magnesium.  Then the precipitate, or fall out, of solution.

When the sodium carbonate comes into contact with water, the different molecules form a bond.  More energy is released during this reaction than required to create the new bonds that form.  This means that the molecules in the solution will now move faster, and thus increasing friction and also increasing temperature of the entire solution.

 The carbonate ions from dissolved sodium carbonate precipitate magnesium and calcium ions from hard water. These metal ions would otherwise combine with soap or detergent and form an insoluble scum that would stain the laundered clothes.

**TLDR:  Sodium Carbonate in the detergent react with water in an exothermic reaction, thus producing heat**

*I feel the need to put a little disclaimer here.  I am not a science teacher, or a chemist, or anything like that.  I'm a junior mathematician.  This is what I found out when I did my own research on this.  If I'm wrong, please feel free to correct me, I would really like to know, but please don't crucify me or anything* :)

**Edit** I forgot to add the links

[This one explains hard water](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-hard-water.htm)

[And this is an excellent resource](http://www.washwise.org.au/_documents/Laundry%20detergent%20ingredients%20info%20sheet.pdf)  if you want to know the science behind laundry detergents.  Lots of info, and lots of pictures

**Edit of the edit**

I take no credit to the above answer as it is all /u/krieksie's research as to the nature of each type of ingredient in detergents

However, as a chemistry student,  my own first guess was that dissolving one of the ingredients (in and of itself) is an exothermic reaction. Krieksie's mentioning of sodium carbonate being an ingredient led me to look up info on that specifically. 

If anyone wanted some real numbers to look at for sodium carbonate:
According to wikipedia, the enthalpy of solution for sodium carbonate is ""−28.1 kJ/mol for a 10% w/w aqueous solution.""

Given this number you could find out how much the temperature might change for a given amount of sodium carbonate, but I'm lazy and that involves me looking up stuff and using my physical chemistry book so you can look into that yourself if you're really that interested."

On top of being a spectacular conversationalist she was stunningly beautiful and mysterious to boot. We were there so long that the food had enough time to get digested, and so she excused herself to go to the ladies' room. She left her handbag on the table, and it was wide open. I thought I saw a ring inside, and my curiosity got the better of me so I peered in. It was indeed a ring. I was disgusted. I don't know how I could've ever trusted her. I felt completely betrayed. I called for our waitress to bring the bill so I'd hopefully leave before the woman came back. The waitress cleared the table of our food and fancy restaurant things (tablecloth, candles, cutlery). She was carrying everything at once, impressively, and I was hopeful she'd be able to bring the bill in time, but the lady came back. She asked me ""what happened to the table? Where are the candles and plates?"" I pointed to the waitress, who was holding them and walking around the restaurant, and then, angry as I was, quickly changed the subject to the ring in her bag. She explained that the ring was a gift from her sister from a few days before she died of cancer. I felt terrible. All I could muster up was ""oh...""

Anyway, the point is that that waitress was really good at holding those candles and may even be able to hold a candle to your wife."

You should have started talking to her about how your wife and yourself met when you were kids, and it kind of was always there, make a whole story, come up with anecdotes...

Now, get a female friend to pose for a few 'household' pictures with you, space them around the house... a drawer and wardrobe with some women's things in, scented candles and shower products in the bathroom along with a trash can, and then invite the girl over.  

Tell her your wife is out of town on a business trip, that she does this a lot and that's why you finally felt the need to talk to her.

245,"I get bewildered too. I grew up in a middle class suburb. Low crime rate. Even then, my parents drilled the mantra ""If it is not nailed or locked down, it is walking away"" into me. Thus, anything valuable that is not on my immediate person is secured behind a locked door, safe, cabinet, etc. I know multiple people who have had ipods or phones stolen from their car after leaving them out on the console or seat (with their car unlocked too) and then are surprised when it happens...

I even had a roommate that would get mildly annoyed/ fascinated with me for keeping the door locked when I was home. Security was just taught to me. It became second nature. "
246,"This never happened.  If it was a 200 person tournament in Florida I was probably there and even if I wasn't I would have heard about it.  It would have been on /r/kappa for weeks.

Smash and FGC tournaments have immortalized fights and near fights because they're so rare.  Both communities have thousands of people and hundreds of big events and physical violence never happens.  Two guys had a grudge match in Street Fighter 4, no punches were thrown and no punches were even close to being thrown and the video of the thing got 2 million hits on world star and people are still talking about it.  The ""almost fight"" went so viral that the guy who got clowned on built his entire online persona around the event.  A girl grabbed a guy at a guilty gear tournament and became a meme that hasn't died to this day (who bitch this is, google that).  Noel Brown actually hit someone 5 years ago at a Marvel tournament and people still talk about that.

This.  Didn't.  Happen.

I asked her if she would mind making a YouTube video that was private - only those I gave the link to would ever see it - telling about how she made it all up.  That way, no matter what happened between us later, I would always have that on file and I could show it to any potential women I would get serious with, or any potential jobs etc... something that would be clear and irrefutable. But she would never do that.  When she got sick, I wanted to ask her one last time if she would do it, because I knew that if she died, I would never have that opportunity again, but I never brought it up again.  It seemed too grim because we all thought she would pull through it.  It was drinking that killed her.  About a half gallon of bad vodka a day.  Cirrhosis of the liver.  One day she passed out and never woke back up.  So that was that.  I cried like a baby because despite how my life is, she was my sister and I loved her.  When she got older, she came clean to the family, just never officially, and that's what she said she was going to do right before she got sick. "
