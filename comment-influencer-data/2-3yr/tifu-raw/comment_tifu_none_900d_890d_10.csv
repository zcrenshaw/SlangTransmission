1,Dude.. the point of masturbating is pleasure you know? 
2,"If a YouTube video is enough to brick a computer, your office needs new computers."
3,I would be traumatized if I was on either end of this. I hope you're ​stronger than I :(
4,"Except you can prove the cop was tailgating which is a fireable civilian-danger risk.  Cop cars keep a record of when the sirens etc are activated, and this wasn't the case for you.

Basically he was risking a severe accident deliberately travelling so close to another vehicle ""on a hunch"", which can get you fired, especially if you make enough of a complaint that someone else higher up's job/promotion is at risk, and they'll throw this guy under the bus.

He was close enough to touch the flame which is only 1-2 feet back from the car, then the heat level dissipates enough to be safe.

I'd threaten to raise HELL with that police force's internal investigations if they don't drop all charges immediately.
"
5,That literally sounds terrifying - if you had not have had CBRNE training I think you may have come out a lot worse. Glad you and the kitty are alright! 
6,Her concern is definitely a positive to come out of this situation I guess.
7,"Hello new irrational fear!

Edit: maybe not so irrational

 "
8,This is like a three stooges episode. 
9,I'm curious how you can just sit there and slap your meat so many times in a row.  Like if you cum 2 times that should be enough
10,Oh dont feel too bad. I'm sure I'm not the only guy here that used shampoo as lube to jerk off in the shower and felt like I was pissing needles for a day
11,You still haven't washed your hands? 
12,That was quite a journey. The lesson I learned is to never give your neighbors your phone number.
13,"maybe physically, but not mentally :/ i now smell my hand everytime i wake up "
14,Why lay a duce in a clogging toilet? Seems like a modified russian roulette to me.
15,You walk in that *goddamn* shrinks office and you tell her Ed Sheeran has the voice of a *goddamn* angel.
16,"There's an upside to this,  you get out doing some work for a little while."
17,"Hi, Fap Master here. Through proper operation and maintenance the penis should be able to operate under even the most adverse conditions. Think of your dick like a 155mm Howitzer, only smaller. Barrel maintenance is paramount. Too much shampoo drys the skin out and contributes to weakening the tophat-shaft junction. 

Similar to a howitzer barrel, you need to check for damage, deformities and foreign objects before slamming out a few high explosive semen rounds. If you fire off a few skeets without proper verifications and checks you're bound to have some damage occur, much like OP had. 

Tldr; through proper maintenance your dick should be able to withstand even the most rigorous fap session.

Edit: Wow! I never expected such a positive response from everyone! I was just hoping my humble advice might help someone in need. But apparently we're making fapping great again! 

Edit: thanks for the gold anonymous fap enthusiast! "
18,How's the bike? Is it OK?
19,"That's my plan, I know I was in the wrong for using the anti lag but someone pulling out causing me to stop short could of caused a real accident"
20,Nope it fell to pieces after my tooth came out
21,"OP is forcing them to embrace current technology. He's a hero they need, but don't deserve."
22,"No, I'm not. But knowing Schumer, I'm sure my story will end up in her material anyway. "
23,im surprised i dont have a burning urge to amputate my hand actually 
24,Fuck that. 
25,"With that attitude, you won't break any records... (but also not your dick ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )"
26,"A bushfire, mate."
27,"Mate... that's grim. 

And your head chef didn't even give you the rest of the night or send you the the ER? Mine ran off like a little bitch when he chopped the tip of his finger off."
28,"I really hope you didn't permanently damage your tongue 

Edit: RIP inbox"
29,You're telling me he didn't feel some dudes fingers in his butthole
30,At least enough for a break.
31,"&gt;&gt;He's a hero they need, but ~~don't deserve~~ can't afford.

Fixed that for you. "
32,"/u/ass-on-houstan-texas can you confirm?

33,Son of a rum puncher I hate when that happens 
34,"Not sure, the person whos house I crashed outside of has it"
35,Next time try Bronner's citrus soap. Smells like orange oil. No chemical burns.
36,This happened to me with lemongrass oil when I was in Thailand on vacation. I was lemongrass crazy while I was there and put several drops into my bath. A few minutes later and my lady bits were en fuego! 
37,Pretty sure this is a rite of passage
38,Concentrated into a single stooge. 
39,Never douche with Listerine either.
40,"Let me tell you a secret: there is non-dairy ice cream that is just as good as, if not better than, the kind that made you shit yourself. I suggest Luna &amp; Larry's Coconut Bliss or So Delicious' coconut or cashew lines, but there are also non-dairy lines by more mainstream brands, such as Ben &amp; Jerry's, Breyer's, and I've even seen mention of some from Häagen Daz.

Secret number two: take a lukewarm or cool bath with some chamomile tea bags thrown in to help with the burns."
41,"And she knew she wasn't equipped to help you if there were ""issues,"" so she referred you to the right place(s)/people. She needed to help for your sake because she's decent, but also in a cover-your-ass type of way as an employer. 

Bummer, though, that they're intent on making a bigger deal out of this than it is, but I can see why it's going down this way. No more Ed Sheeran at work for you!"
42,That's a weird name for a cat. 
43,"That might actually help, see. Next time you see your work shrink, memorise some Cannibal Corpse lyrics beforehand and recite them while rocking yourself quietly.

""/u/what_choice, are you alright?""

""Th..the smell of decay seeps from her maggot filled cavity... I cum blood from m-my erection.. I pissed in her maggot filled asshole...""

44,Is the house OK? 
45,This. This is the plan.
46,You did absolutely everything wrong but sometimes the life of a Sims character is tough
47,"I one time put IcyHot on my ballsack, just to see what happened. I applied it, waited a few seconds, then sprinted to the shower because of the pain. I scrubbed all of it off and thought I was done. Then, the hot part hit. I think that one hurt more just because it was unexpected. Just wanted to let you know you're not alone in stupid genital experimentation."
48,"This is kinda gross.

I get the yellow mellow thing for saving water and whatnot. But you can't just leave tp to build up like that wtf. Just get a small garbage can and throw the tp in there."
49,"I'm calling BS on this. 
You're meant to grip the shorts of the outside leg, yet you managed to miss completely and not only get below the waistband/up the leg of the guy's shorts AND underwear but also ""grabbed thier rectum"" (sic). 
You also claim in the comments you got, ""about 3 fingers inside thier hole"" (sic), but that the guy somehow didn't notice? Unless he's accomodating Lexington Steele every second night there's no way a guy who's tensed up trying to scrum isn't noticing that happen to him."
50,Sooooo......Why are you corroding metals? 
51,"I'll take ""things I hope to never endure"" for 200"
52,"I worked for a computer refurbisher and this makes no sense. We've even made small python scripts to force overheating, the computer just turns off. I'm talking about old machines. If they had safeguards in place, I can't imagine what you guys call a computer in your office."
53,God! Are the pieces ok?
54,Where I'm from we call that plan C. 
55,"Just to think that being in the military going to the middle east and Korea, and your whole life before it, was preparation to save your life. What a funny world."

Hahahaaha... Hah... *sobs*

It gets so lonely "
59,"Bah, casuals

It usually takes me 4 20min sessions "
60,I'd feel weird leaving my waste to sit in the toilet without flushing.
61,"Well goodness sakes alive! Bless your stinky fat fingers. If I were you I would would start wearing surgical gloves during the matches. You never know when this could happen again. Finger me once, shame on you, finger me twice, we had better be Netflix and chillin. "
62,How would he not feel being penetrated tho
63,I wasn't edgy enough at the time of creating this name. However I also considered XxFapMaster420xX. 
64,"I mean, I feel like that's the proper response to chopping a part of you off. I've done it myself, and it's not what I would consider pleasant. "
65,Let's see this dick cast thing. 
66,Fugue state.

72,Yeah after they went to the house dentist.
73,"I'm an adult man who has shit himself as recently as Tuesday....so I believe I have standing when I ask: who the fuck stands 4+ deep in a public restroom when your private bathroom is an elevator ride away?

Edit:  For those who asked...Tuesday wasn't that interesting.  I was home...just didn't make to the toilet in time.  It's your run-of-the-mill ""shit yourself at home"" story.  Now...the time outside the 7-Eleven when I had a adult decision to make....and I chose poorly...that was a good one.
"
74,Should've break checked him tho
75,Especially since s/he's a chef.
76,Idk I'd feel weird about putting toilet paper with vag juices and urine anywhere other than the toilet. 
77,"What does your ruptured wiener and a jerk who drinks too much have in common?  

You're both a couple of dicks getting plastered."
78,Peen
79,"It doesn't always clog, but my roommate and I usually don't flush unless we drop a deuce. She also leaves TP in the bowl 'cause I guess girls use it either way, and that tends to result in clogging when I go. "
80,More like -200.
81,"Just talk to her. About anything. The more you put it off the worse you will like this

87,you dont to do it too much that you blast your barriers you know
88,"Why do you have to pay for the repairs? I never had to pay for company equipment in my life, even the stuff I accidentally broke. Seems odd, especially if it was old and sounds like it needed replacing anyhow."
89,Yes. And so did Amy Schumer. 
90,"My boss tried to charge me for a mistake. I looked it up, and it's illegal (in the US anyway). Look it up on the Department of Labor website. Basically, since you doing stellar stuff isn't guarenteed a bonus, they can't charge you for mistakes. They could still fire you, but they can't threaten you with termination contigent on you paying for the damage. Unless you're 1099..."
91,Haha somehow I don't think I'll have a choice ...
92,"""If you don't know what it is, look it up.""

98,Neither is ripping chunks out of your mouth with a super frozen spoon. 
99,"Why 64 and not 69?
"
100,"Is your wife still friends with Ursula?

Because honestly even if my husband *was* cheating on me, if one of my ""friends"" aired all my business on Facebook, that person would be on the receiving end of a furious scolding and a swift shunning. That person would not be my friend ever again. "
101,"Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive"
102,"Can confirm. Am a chef, worked with a girl years back who got dropped on her head while participating in drunken shenanigans and knocked something loose. Lost her sense of smell which makes up the majority of our sense of taste.  It was a career killer. "
103,You heard it here first folks.
104,"Damn, they put your teeth back in. I wonder how that feels."
105,"Dentist here. Yes and no. Re-implanted avulsed teeth have a low success rate. The guidelines say that you should only do it if the tooth has been out of the mouth for 60 minutes or less and kept hydrated. To keep it hydrated, a cup with your own saliva is the best thing. Milk is another, less ideal option. They also make a commercial product (a liquid solution) designed for this situation, but I forget the name at the moment. If you've done everything right, and get to a dentist quickly, they will take x-rays to determine if there is any part of the tooth left behind or if there are any related jaw fractures. If you're lucky and the tooth truly came out in one piece without any fractures, they will re-implant the tooth and splint it to the teeth around it to stabilize it. You will have to be very careful to not traumatize it again for a minimum of 2 weeks (soft foods, etc.) If your luck continues, the tooth will revascularize. Even so, over time the tooth may start to darken and/or become painful. Most of the time, you need a root canal and a crown, but it may not be for months or years after the original injury. Sorry for the long-winded explanation. Hope it's informative."
106,Rectum? DAMN NEAR KILLED EM!

Still can't take a shot of any hard alcohol because liquid steroids messed it all up for me! 

"
112,"For real, if this car is as expensive as it sounds I'd let him help me fund fixing it up."
113,Not going to lie until the TLDR I thought you were a guy playing with a prostate massager. Big difference. 
114,"Yeah, I'm also a chef, and couldn't imagine losing my sense of taste. Pretty sure that would be a career killer"
115,"Yeah if computers get too hot, they have protection mechanisms built in that'll forcefully shut the machine down to protect itself.

Unless the machines are like over 20 years old, there's no way they could be permanent damaged, and if a computer can't play audio and render a blue screen on a website for 12 hours without getting hot, there's a major issue."
116,I was more thinking Behemoth.
117,Maybe he was enjoying it
118,"I had blocked those memories out. I used some and once it's up your dick, you're fucked. No amount of washing or pissing will make it go away. 

I discovered conditioner works better without the searing pain if some goes into your cock hole. I used Mane n' Tail since it has no harsh chemicals in it.

I think I've said too much."
119,He even saved his cat's life!
120,"This was the sweetest, most helpful comment. "
121,Wonder what would happen if you submitted noise complaints against them
122,"Depending on where you are it may be illegal for them to charge you for it. That said, depending on where you work they could potentially fire you."

126,"This reminds me of the time my grandfather told me that one night he came home late from the bar and drunkenly decided to clean the bathtub. He used comet mixed with bleach. It made some kind of gas that made him pass out in the bathtub until my grandmother came into the bathroom to investigate the ""thud"" "
127,"Dude.. I'm not even finished reading and I've upvoted.

134,"Did you tell the counsellor ""Ok, what happened was I listened to this song for the first time and wasn't prepared for it. It reminded me of [insert person who's passed recently or a long time ago] and this Sheeran dude is an invisible emotional ninja cutting onions, I tell you. I'm not depressed, I'm just a person who got caught off guard by a beautiful, surprisingly evocative song by a guy who knows his way around the palette and canvas of emotional landscapes. This is why I listen to metal! Onion free metal!"" and then air guitar your way out of the room?"
