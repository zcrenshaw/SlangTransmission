4,"What country do you live in? In the US, you are protected under Reg E and you have the right to file a dispute for any electronic funds transfers made in error with your financial institution as long as they are reported within a reasonable amount of time.

Contact your financial institution and tell them that you have made a payment error and you just noticed it on your statement. You have already contacted the payee and they will not work with you. Once the dispute it filled, the FI has no more than 10 business days to complete it's investigation. They can extend this to 45 calendar days only if they: provisionally credit your account for the full amount (they can hold up to a small amount), inform you of the amount and date of the credit, and allow you to use the credit during the investigation.

Your FI may try to give you the run a round, but they are required by law to file this and do an investigation. That is a large amount of money to just send off and this is one of the many reasons why this regulation exists.

I work at a bank and have to work with Reg E everyday; I've seen situations like yours happen more times than I can count and I believe all of them had gotten resolved pretty well."
5,"I had a similar experience in high school, only the rumor was that I was a drug dealer.

Needless to say I did not say that and have never owned a gun and at the time ""my room"" was a house off campus.

I got investigated and she stupidly said I said it in class so I had thirty witnesses on my side but I still had to drop the class and not a goddamned thing happened to that crazy professor.

76,It doesn't matter that you couldn't afford a lawyer. You're still not obligated to say anything to them and that's the most important thing to realize when talking to the police in your situation.

Second up, a fucking hand job? You kidding me? You can get that at home, even if you're single. A hand job was hardly worth trying for when i was 16 (miss you, Kris). For $100 you could have bought a good blow job. 

Next up, never trust a hooker, no matter where she works. And in general, guns are always loaded, the electricity is always live, and the girl has an std. Go into every situation thinking that, and you'll be safe. "

Also, I don't know if you have some kind of medical condition, but if you *normally* practice good hygiene, then missing one shower shouldn't have caused three people to complain about your smell.  You have to wash and changes clothes regularly.  I saw elsewhere in this thread that it's a pain in the ass to do, but that's something you just have to suck up.  If money is an issue for the machines, do some bathtub laundry and hang them up to dry.

He clicked the wrong clicky-thing on the Internet, so he's out $40,000? 

I'd call every media outlet within 1000 miles and chain myself to that fucking bank's doors until they fixed it. There's no way a simple mistake like that can't be reversed by someone high enough up the ladder. 

If you want your money back, then get your fucking money back. It's really that simple. 

As soon as they choose to, they can restore it just as quickly and easily as you lost it.  

EDIT: Yes, financial wizards, I do understand that he's not ""out"" $40,000. 

But yesterday he had control of $40,000, and today he does not. The money has contributed to his future, sure, but that's not what he wanted to do with it. That debt wasn't about to set him on fire any time in the immediate future, and he had plans for that money in the present. 
A simple mistake shouldn't be able to force that decision on him when there's so much money in question. 

What if he had a 25-year mortgage for $500,000, and had $500,000 in the bank with many grand plans for it, and accidentally made a $500,000 payment one month instead of a $5,000 payment? Would you tell him to move on? Would you tell him to fuck his plans and be happy he's mortgage-free? 

He had years to pay off that loan, and he had other plans for that money. So he should get his money back. 

Yes, it's that simple. And yes, I really would chain myself to the doors, because no one does that anymore, and it would attract every news camera in the area until whoever was in charge threw up their hands and said, ""Screw this, let's give this guy his money so all of these people can get the fuck out of here immediately.""

And I'd bet it all that not five minutes after that was spoken, I'd have my money back.

edit: aight fam, it's happening. Will try to have it up come the weekend or early next week. It's been so long I can't even remember what the turnover on a development job is. Gonna take it to Wally Greens."

174,"I fostered bottle kittens for years, and I cannot even *imagine* how difficult it would be to foster 8 tiny puppers. I'd get kittens only a few days old, and you have to bottle feed them every 3 hours or so (through the night as well). And they don't pee or poop without ""external stimuli,"" so you have to rub their tiny butts with moist toilettes. Even if you're diligent, they still inevitably get constipated, so you feed them pumpkin or give them tiny kitten enemas (so many kitten enemas). If they get dehydrated and sick, you have to give them liquid injections. And so much ringworm. I'm not even remotely phased by ringworm anymore. And fleas. And regular worms. If you get a rare lone kitten, it tends to get lonely, so you have to sleep for weeks with it on your chest, which is generally pretty awesome, except for the constant worry about crushing it or having it fall off the bed. 

Anyways, it's hard work, but also so rewarding, and I salute you. "

189,"You made an honest mistake that really doesn't have that bad of repercussions. So you can't go an buy a home right away, that's unfortunate, but you also just freed up some monthly income. 

The best thing you can do is tell her right away and let her know that you're trying to follow up with the lender, but it looks unlikely that you'll be able to revert the payment. Put together a spreadsheet of all of your monthly expenses. Break them out into groups, such as utilities, loans, credit cards, groceries, etc. Go through every single one and ask yourself, ""how can I reduce this?"". 

* For cable/phone/internet provider, consider dropping land line and cable, and use internet only. Opt for a low speed plan. 

* For electricity, think of how you can reduce usage. Keep more lights off, shut down electronics when not in use, etc.

* Credit cards: Hopefully you're not carrying a balance, but if you are, look to transfer the balance to one of your other cards at 0% (be sure to pay off the receiving card first), then work to pay that off over time.

* Reduce your overall entertainment spending

* Set a budget

* Make a weekly menu for meals, buy the groceries and make the meals together, also prepping lunch for the next day.

Depending on your income/expense ratio, you could easily save up enough for next year. The harder you crunch and really commit to a budget, the faster the recovery. We waste so much money on things we don't really need, only to short ourselves on the large purchases we desperately need.

Started smoking and drinking, all that jazz, which T wasn't really into. One day, I ditched school to go hang out in the park when I get a call from Ts older brother accusing me of breaking into his beautiful old Mustang than him and his dad built from scratch (seriously that ride was awesome). He said that everyone was saying that I was the one that broke into his car, stole his stereo, weed, etc. And then proceeded to key the living hell out of it. He told me T had heard me bragging about it at school, which I hadn't attended in about a week. This rumor was never settled. I plead my case to them, to no avail. It completely ruined the friendship, to this day we still don't talk. Fast forward to about 6 years later. I run in to the youngest brother, who was doing what I used to do in high school, ditch and get high in the park with all the other rebel kids. We get to talking about what happened and he tells me that it was actually their dad that did all those things to teach the oldest brother a lesson of some kind. He blamed me for it, because he never really liked me. That is pretty much the end of it. The real fucked up part, is that everybody knows I didn't do it now, but just kind of let it go..."

Everyone who frequents /r/wallstreetbets knew he wasn't serious. They're familiar with him. The people who got trolled were the people who saw it from /r/all and thought the guy was serious and took his advice.

The trolling isn't really recent. It's been going on for several months, which turned into a meme to inverse whatever FSComeau says."

I was not involved at all in this situation, but I definitely hung around that shady group of kids. I didn't give a fuck about athletics, so I never was around to hear the rumors originate. I remember being in art class and having one of my classmates talking about how /u/Baehldozer and another kid were going to shoot up an upcoming event (it was a Grandparents brunch). It was pretty fucking ridiculous. I noticed that /u/Baehldozer wasn't coming to school anymore, which sucked, because he was my weed dealer, but everyone kept freaking out about how that kid got arrested before school and there were now cops guarding the front entrance and idk the entire situation just sucked ass. The funny thing is around my senior year people started making fun of ME for being the quiet kid and that I was going to blow up the school. I put a stop to those rumors really fucking fast.

307,"&gt; bullying at this degree can cause a Columbine (sp?) style shooting. 

Ah, yes, the old narrative pushed by the reporters who had no clue what was going on and were quite literally playing a game of telephone and fabricating news.

For the record, Columbine had nothing to do with bullying.  This lie led to countless bullied and outcast kids being treated even worse by their peers, on top of having forced meetings with incompetent school counselors.  Columbine was two assholes: one psychopathic and the other a loser who went along with whatever his asshole friend wanted to do.

Edit: I forgot to mention that they quite literally intended for it to be the worst domestic terror attack in history.  They constructed explosives which, were it not for their utter incompetence, would have killed a huge number of people.  It wasn't a school shooting, it was a failed herding intended to lock people in the library or gym (I forget which) and blow them up."
