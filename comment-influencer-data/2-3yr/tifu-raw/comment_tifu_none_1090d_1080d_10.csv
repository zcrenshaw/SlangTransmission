if you weren't speeding, and he was tailgating you....the judge may throw it out.  If you had sped up [which he may have been trying to prod you into doing], he would have nailed you for that.

6,"This is more of a FU for the software development company. There is no reason in finance for there to ever be two successive decimals. That's probably why it wasn't tested in the first place.

18,When I was 19 I had a miscarriage on a Monday and had missed work that day and they day after.  Decided to go to work (worked at walmart) I get to work and managers pull me into the office.  Apparently I had not called in on the Monday. They fired me.  I drive home crying uncontrollably. Park my car at my apartment. Decide to leave the next day. Car WILL NOT start. Cry more.  Walk to local Mexican used tire place to beg someone to help me. Crying like it's going out of style.  Friendly man who did not speak much English walks back with me and shows me I had it in drive.  Cried more.  That night he left Daisies on my car and a tiny teddy bear.  He was the only person there for me in that tough time since my boyfriend was away for work and he couldn't even understand why I was crying.  
19,Dude... not cool
20,"Cockroaches can FLY?!

Also sorry bro that sucks."
21,"I almost killed one of my friends shooting targets, as well. We were shooting tannerite targets with my Remington .243 out in a field one day. He went and set the target a hundred yards out, and walked back to my car where I was standing. After he got back, I opened up the car door and rested the rifle on top of it, setting the target in the sights. As I put my finger on the trigger and let out a breath in prep for the shot, the scope went black. I instantly took my finger off the trigger and swung the gun upright, to see my buddy walking directly across my line of fire. 

He got quite a bit of hell from me for that, cause had he been a split second later he would've gotten a .243 bullet square in the chest at near point blank range. That was the last time I ever shot targets with him."

25,"As a former police officer myself i reccomend you go to court. This officer was behaving totally unreasonably. Also, was he even on duty? There are a lot of red flags here. A lot of times officers have this superiority complex and do thibgs that arent always on the up and up. He likely wint even show to court and it will be dismissed.

32,"Good call, because the kind of person who would walk in front of someone preparing to fire is the same kind of person who won't exercise caution when they're the ones holding the boom stick."

34,How is this TIFU? You rekt an impolite kid.
35,"Seems like the biggest FU was leaving the hospital against medical advice. It is not easy to leave as they try their best to keep you there, which makes this story sound a bit fishy.

38,"I just want to take this opportunity to address those who might be unfamiliar with the four cardinal rules of firearm safety.

* Treat every firearm as if it's loaded.
* Never point a firearm at anything you are not willing to destroy.
* Always be sure of your target and what is beyond it.
* Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to fire.

EDIT: Upon suggestion to clarify, these rules apply to firearms and almost anything that expels a projectile at high velocities.  Air rifles, BB guns, bows, even paintball guns outside the controlled environment they're used in.  Anything that fires a projectile at high velocity can maim or kill if used improperly.

EDIT 2: I'm pretty sure reddit law requires me to say ""Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!""  That's the second time I've been gilded, both times for preaching the message of safety in one area or another.  I guess I should do that more often."

82,"Woah! I used to listen to the original version when I was a lot younger (about 7 years old), and I started to hear more and more of the censored version playing everywhere and was confused. I thought, ""isn't it supposed to be retarded and not started?"" But over the years I came to accept that as a misunderstanding of what I first heard, as I was very young. Op, your tale of woe has given me redemption to a frustrating conflict that's been going on in my mind for a very long time."

85,"I was driving to Walmart one early morning, like 2 am, because I was sick and had run out of cough medicine. I was going about 5 below the speed limit on a side street, because I was more worried about paying attention with my fuzzy head than getting there fast. All of a sudden, a car comes flying up behind me, riding my ass and engine revving. The thing is, it's 2 in the morning in a residential area. The street is empty. Anyone willing to drive like that should have no problem passing me. I figure it's a cop trying to scare me into speeding--the only ticket I ever got in my life is from that happening.  I don't fall for it anymore. So I allow myself to slow down a bit more, to make sure he knows he can pass, but he just stays behind me, tailgating me aggresively, like I've got his grandma tied up in my trunk.

After a few minutes of this, I turn onto the main road to Walmart, which is two lane. No reason not to pass, but he stays behind me, even after a lane change. If I had been ten years younger--like I was when I got that ticket--I would have between shitting myself, but I'm thirty four years old and the carefullest driver I know. At this point, we're on a well lit street and I can see it is a police cruiser, and he finally stopped tailgating me once I signaled to pull into Walmart. 

Fuuuuck you, you big bully. Turn on your sirens or get off my ass."
86,"Banks are just terrible at technology from what I have read. Being an 'IT Person' is a low status job there.

Yet, you will have some extremely talented C++ programmers there, though most of them probably will be employed in trading division.

Edit: [u/Mexiturtle]  (https://www.reddit.com/user/Mexiturtle) has raised a good point and I realized that I have not been clear in making my point. Banks are very good at using technology for specific purpose. They are spending tons of money that are useful in making it money (Systems that are used for High frequency trading, supercomputers that are useful for number crunching etc). Infact, they have become a core part of it's business which is precisely why banks are setting up innovation labs to make better use of technology along with investing in up and coming technology like quantum computing. On the other hand the situation mentioned by the OP involves user application software which is not particularly profitable and they have neglected that and are terrible at fixing stuff like that."

The magistrate never rules in your favor short of a miracle. If you want to see a real judge you have to pay again (50 this time, 25 the first time). When you see the judge they are also very biased against you so short of the cop not showing you're fucked. Even if you win you're out 75 dollars plus 2 days of work.

It's a no win system. Also cops tailgating is rampant and a fking disgrace. They issue citations under the pretence of safety (when it's obv to fund their dept) and do bullshit like this. Also contemporary studies indicate the speed limit does not enhance safety at all.

One of the things I would do was skateboard and I figured Hammie would enjoy a ride. So I set him on the front of the board got on my knees and started to push. I am not sure how far I made it before I had hit a crack in the sidewalk and it caused the board to bounce. This bounce knocked Hammie off the board and I'm front of the front wheels, and the skateboard, with all my weight ran over little Hammie. This wasn't just a bump and skid, the entire wheel had gone over him.  At this point he is writhing in pain in the ground. So I scoop him up with both hands and run home as fast as I can, the whole way Hammie kicking and squrming in my hands. I run up to my father and ask him to fix my friend...

I immediately pulled over, shut off the engine, and turned on my hazard lights.

In county's that don't have the ordinance legally requiring the ticketing officer's presence, the judge will still hold the hearing. Officers don't miss court on a whim, their feelings about your individual ticket is a blip on their radar among  50 other blips that day.

That really doesn't make any sense. If you're really serious about any of this (meaning: you're not lying and you really had an eye opener and want to take life seriously), get your ass back in there. Even though you 'knew what caused it', you have no idea what kind of damage has been done. You're not a medical professional. You're not just supposed to stay in the hospital so the doctors can find out what caused it, they need to make sure you don't have any lasting damage. You don't know exactly what entered your body, you hit your had, you had convulsions, you had a cardiac arrest(!!!!!!), you were out for 7 hours. You are NOT in the safe zone right now. You need medical attention, right now. 

At least, that's assuming you're not joking around about this (which would be sick), and that you really are ready to grow up and take care of yourself.

I've had my problems with drugs and health in the past as well, and I'm not judging you for that. But leaving the hospital after a cardiac arrest and just going about your day is completely idiotic. Please, please get yourself looked after.

Don't Shave That Hair!!!
I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!
