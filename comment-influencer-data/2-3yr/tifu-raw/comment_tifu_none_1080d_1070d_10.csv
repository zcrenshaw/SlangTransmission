9,Lab technologist here. Sorry to tell you but you TIFU twice- spilling any of the urine in a 24H collection test WILL fuck up your results. And could lead to mistreatment.

Edit: just to clarify what I meant here, it could have been worse if you had decided to use Plaster of Paris rather than cement to make your mold. Portland cement warms up a bit when it sets, but Plaster of Paris puts out roughly 30 times as much heat (about 3900 calories per gram vs. 120 for cement, from what I've read). Putting your feet in a bucket full of it would almost certainly have cost you your toes, and quite possibly the rest of your feet too.

It's *also* good that you used cling film, since Portland cement is highly caustic, as others have pointed out. I'm assuming here that you used Portland cement since it's by far the most common type."

41,"I wouldn't even say overreacted.  This whole story is her fault.  She called him and told him his son didn't want to go on the trip, then she clearly made no effort to let him know that the son did want to go until it was too late and he was already at the airport.  From the sounds of it she just left the son at his house alone and let OP's mom go rescue him?  And clearly the ex wife painted the whole thing as ""OP didn't want to take you"" to their son, so now he's upset.  This is just terrible parenting by the ex wife, no blame on OP at all that I can see.

OP, is your mom willing to testify that your ex wife left your son alone at your house for four hours after she told you he wouldn't be going with you on vacation?  You could probably get more custody rights after an incident like this."

BEWARE HOME DEPOT SCAM

A ""heads up"" for you all who may be regular Home Depot
customers.

Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam
while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned
out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't
happen to you.
Here's how the scam works:

Two seriously good-looking 18 or 19-year-old girls
come over to your car
as you are packing your shopping into the trunk. They
both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their
breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. It is impossible
not to
look.

When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say
""No"" and instead ask
you for a ride to another Home Depot. You agree and
they get in the back seat. On the way, they start having sex with each
other.
Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and
performs oral sex on you, while the other one steals your wallet.

I had my wallet stolen October 4th, 9th, 10th, twice
on the 15th, 17th, 20th, 28th, three times just yesterday, and very
likely again this upcoming weekend as soon as I can buy some more
wallets.

Again - beware!! "
76,Once I get done work I'm going to dive through and see if I can find it
77,"You're a good person. The lesson here is to be more careful about who deserves your charity, not to give up on people. Be very careful when listening to people's stories and try to find ways to help them that allow you to control the situation. If someone is truly desperate, they will be far more concerned with solving their actual problem rather than getting a hold of your cash. "
78,So what's next on your bucket list?
79,"Update: just finished the interview. Feel pretty good about it. I'll find out in the next couple of days...""when the other shoe drops."" "

Set the bag down to get the pies out, take them out one at a time. 

A soda can or bottle can help keep the pizzas balanced in the passenger seat if yours slopes back. Tilted pizzas means the cheese runs to one side. 

Keep your wits about you, pizza delivery people get robbed because they walk around with food and money. 

Remember to smile, stand with your back straight when giving the pizza to a customer, they'll be more likely to tip well.

It was a colossal fuck up on the part of the school"
94,"Listen OP, next year you and your wife are probably going to look and feel a bit haggard due to your new three-month-old.  Apparently you might be tempted to buy her makeup and beauty supplies in response to this for your next anniversary gift, but hopefully you will see the parallel here and realize that this would be an awful idea.  There's a reason why flowers, chocolate, and jewelry are staple gifts to women."

97,"Rip on this poor bastard all you want, addiction is addiction, and that petty shit isn't helping anyone. 

The suggestion of switching to a flip phone is probably the best route/place to start. Beyond that, prioritize your debts by working to pay down the smallest debts first, then work upward. If you really want to climb out of debt, you have to be vigilant and give up frivolous spending. Most people can cut a lot of unnecessary expenditure by taking a sober look at how they really spend. An outside set of eyes/perspective can help significantly as well. Pick the person you know to be most financially responsible and ask for advice. Best of luck, OP. "

107,"I got scammed as well. Kind of sucks, but I'm at a better place now, so I'm not as bitter about it. 
I was living out of my car with my girlfriend. I had just gotten a job (first week) and we are parked at a parking lot by my workplace, so that I wouldn't be late. We had been living out of the car for 3 months by then, so, in all honesty, you could probably tell. This guy comes up to us and asks us for some cash. Our windows are down, because it's summer time, and we couldn't afford to run the car for long. Asks us for $10 so that he could catch the metro to get home. We get into a bit of a conversation since we all spoke the same first language (not English), and we end up telling him that we live out of our car. We point to the back, where all of our blankets, pillows, and few worldly possessions are. He says he feels badly to ask for money like this, and then he gives us his number and address and says that he'll pay us back. We tell him that I'm actually an hour and a half early for work, so we can actually drive him where he needs to go! He insists that he doesn't want to impose, and then we settle to give him the money. I only had a twenty in me, and it was literally the last of our cash, save for some coins in the console and whatnot. He then changes his story, and says that he might need to take a cab from the metro station, because he doesn't know if his bus will run at this time, so 20 would be better. He seemed genuine enough, and we thought he would do right by us, so we give him the twenty. Five days later, we're running low on gas, payday isn't for another 3 days, and we still haven't heard from him. So  we give him a ring. No answer. Left voicemails, nothing. Nothing at could do about it, except for be bitter. My car ended up running completely empty on the way to get my paycheck. A roadside assistance vehicle gave us enough gas to get to the gas station, and I could literally only put 78 cents in the tank. It got us to where we needed to go though, and I'm so grateful for that. Fast forward 2 years after this happened. I'm walking around with my girlfriend, grocery shopping, and we run into the exact same guy. He goes through the same shannanigans with us, and we literally say ""you know, you've done this to us before"". I guess we looked less homeless this time around, so he didn't recognise us, but the moment he did, he bolted so fast. 
To this day though, I still give money to people that look like they need it. I was in a shitty situation, and that was a shitty guy, but that doesn't change the fact that I have been in that situation. I wouldn't wish it on  anyone. It sucks that this happened to you OP, but just keep on being a great person.

So the alert comes in and our nagios requires a comment to ack an alarm. I typed ""STFU"" as the comment, and of course the customer got emailed.

We were parked downtown late one night, drunk ourselves, when we saw him walking towards our car figuring he was going to ask his usual thing. Before he had a chance to say anything though my friend said ""Hey man can I get a dollar, I need gas money to get home?"" and without any hesitation the guy pulled a five out and gave it to him. My friend then thanked him, pulled out some ones, and gave him change. He walked off looking perplexed without ever saying a word.

I watched her as she went from person to person in the parking lot of the same home depot.  She made her way to me and gave the same story as before.  I asked her what happened during the last week that kept her from going to abilene? She became visibly flustered and choked trying to come up with a response.  I called her out on the scam. She stormed off, climbed into a brand new GMC Sierra with fancy chrome wheels, parked in a handicap spot, and drove off.  Made my day! "

What better way to make the kid pissed at dad?

1. Make dad so angry he shuts down in a conversation.  As his ex wife, I'm sure she has a gold medal in pissing him off.  If OP's story played out like he says, *she knew he'd get mad and shut down*

2. Act business as usual to kid

3. Drop kid off, knowing you're gone and likely not going to know.

4.  Kid gets more pissed at you by the minute.

It's diabolical.  You're going to need to spend a long time making this up to your kid.  Emotionally and just suckage-wise.  Thing is, don't check out and give up.  That is what your ex is hoping for.  Show your son that even though you're ashamed, and feel terrible, that nothing will dissuade you from loving him.  

And for the love of god, stop letting your ex tilt you like that.  She made you irrational with anger, which led to some of this.

TL;DR his ex is a manipulative monster that orchestrated this entire thing in order to alienate him from his kid by causing him to shut down.  And his mistake was letting her, but this isn't entirely his fault.

I just picked up my son and dropped him off at his mom's house. He is still giving me the silent treatment. His teacher was waiting with him because she was worried something was wrong. He was really quiet and sad the whole day which is really unlike him. I felt so embarrassed telling her what happened.

Luckily my ex father in law was there when I dropped him off and not my ex. The last thing my son needs is for his parents  to be yelling in the street.

I don't even have proof that my ex lied to me. It's my word against hers. i hope he will forgive me in time.

He refused my hug and hugged his grandpa instead. He started crying really badly. My son rarely cries and I felt like the biggest pos because I caused him so much sadness.

Im not going to lie but I feel like such a jerk. I ended up crying again on the drive home.
