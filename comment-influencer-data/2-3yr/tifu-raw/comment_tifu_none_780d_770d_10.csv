1,"Ahh, OP I see where you fucked up. H&amp;S is only for head and shoulders. For your case, you needed Elbow Cracks &amp; Johnsons. That oughta fix it.

9,At least now everybody knows you're not a two pump chump
10,"Similar thing happened to my dad. Day 1: wow my chest really hurts, probably just indigestion.

Day 2: This must be a bad case of it huh

Day 3: Yeah, I'll go see a doctor why not.

Later in day 3: The doctors told him he was having a heart attack and needed surgery NOW.

 "
11,"This man is a legend for adding the dick pics for proof.

These posts remind me of why I use reddit. "
12,"I mean the dude ran away afterwards, so I'm imagining people know.

Either way it's not a big deal. Farts are funny and natural. As long as OP isn't dropping thunder every Sunday he's fine."
13,"I didn't run away, I silently crept.  

OK, I ran away...shut up!  "
14,"My husband's appendectomy experience was similar. He had awful nausea and stomach pain for a couple of days, and I finally convinced him that he needed to see a doctor. 

We tell the doc my husband's symptoms and he has some tests run. Doc: ""Your appendix needs to come out.""

My husband: ""Can we schedule that for next week? I have to get back to work.""

The doctor's incredulous wtf face shut him up pretty fast and he had surgery that afternoon. "

28,"Well it's really stupid if your coworker truly hates you now, and anyway, the truth was going to come out eventually."
29,"We have a product we carry called ""Tuna ^^^for ^^^cats""

I pointed out the small type ^^^For ^^^Cats (mind you it has a picture of cats on the label) and she just straightened right up, said ""Ummmm, nevermind"" and I never saw her come shopping there again."
30,"I'm sorry this happened to you OP. I am the mother of a son with autism and you clearly didn't MEAN to spill coffee on the table. You reacted to HER and it made the situation so much worse. 

Even if you had burned him, which you clearly didn't, it was an accident. I know it can be extremely stressful traveling with my son but instead of chewing someone out for a mistake, you set a good peer model for them so THEY know how to act if a similar situation ever arises. 

Shame on her behavior. You did nothing wrong and you shouldn't feel bad. "

41,You're God dam right
42,"I really hope you don't let this eat at you - it's definitely not your fault. Sure you could have slowed down, but he could have thought about his positioning and the possible consequences of being in said position."
43,How big is that anaconda normally?
44,"You should go back whenever they are doing confession and try to get into a confessional with this priest. Act all nonchalant and cool about it, and he'll ask about your sins and you can be all like ""I farted on your service, father."" 

Then post a follow-up here and say how many Hail Mary's he charged you with.

Edit: Might wanna switch to Saturday mass next week."
45,Yeah firing went too far that manager is a dick. There's always a few people like that who love their power and love wielding it. 
46,"It's kinda fucked up that they felt no need to verify they were cops, I'll be frank I don't think I would've opened the door. I would've backed off, told them I was calling 911, then would've done so"
47,"I had a similar experience, though for me it was abdominal pain. I was sure my appendix or something had exploded because the pain was seriously 9/10. Halfway to my parents' room, because this was at 3AM *of course*, I doubled over and had to grab a chair to keep from falling and ripped the loudest fart ever. The dog *outside* started barking. On the bright side, the pain was immediately alleviated and I didn't wake up any of my (human) family members. "
48,"My dad used to work at a petco. He would snack out of the dog treat buffet. He said they were all sugar free and were very mild tasting. They're just snacks that are safe for your pets, not snacks that are for ONLY DOGS OR ELSE .

49,I love this comment (in a platonic way)

57,"Around middle school, when I was in a Catholic school, we learned that the Holy Spirit sometimes manifested in the form of ""a mighty wind."" This very promptly turned into a fart joke."

63,"Best church laugh I ever heard was at my nieces Christening. Big Catholic church, completely full, both sides somewhat quiet, easy going people. My nieces two brothers were sitting in the pew next to me and they were grab assing. The older brother got a little rough, and little brother yelled ""KNOCK IT OFF FUCKFACE!"". There was a lull, then the whole place just fell apart. My SIL was mortified. "
64,"So let me get this straight....

He is sitting on the other side of a door that swings inward - towards himself - with no way of warning the person opening the door that he is there, in this position?

Someone... possibly multiple someones.... is responsible for this.  It ain't you.  There is no version of this where you are responsible.  

The first time someone seems to indicate you are responsible 'you should be more careful opening doors' you put things in terms EXACTLY like I did.

Throw it back at the dickbags face, 'why was he sitting in the path of how a door opens?  Who the fuck does this?  Does OSHA know?  has an injury report been filled out?

In fact, why wasn't I consulted about the injury report?  Why was none filled out?  I m calling HR...'.

84,"*shudder* So you just reminded me of a thing...

Middle school had a pool; gym class had a week or two of swimming each year. Had a particularly hairy gym teacher that would enter the pool with the kids. When he stood in chest deep water, the 2-3 inch long hair all over his body would sit on the surface and wiggle around with the water, radiating out from him like cilia on a bacterium.

104,"You are not alone buddy, the exact same thing happened to me (except the vacation part). I thought I was constipated, but after 5 days of feeling that way, I thought it was not normal. At hospital, I had a cat-scan and they rushed me into surgery minutes later.

The surgeon told me next morning that I came very close to dying, that the infection already started to spread and she had no idea why I was not boiling with fever. My blood test confirmed that I was pretty sick. They put me on a big antibiotic treatment + morphine for the pain. Then 3 days of hell in hospital with my body finally shutting down due to infection (they cleaned up as much as they could in surgery but the damage was done).


24 hours before my surgery I was playing golf with my dad. When he came to see me in hospital in the morning, he said what a dad would say in this occasion ""I knew you were dying, that's why I let you win!"""

Loud knock on the front door, we heard ""JPD open up"" my mom's initial reaction was confused understandably because we had been home all evening, not doing anything special. My mom investigates by looking thru the peephole at the same time that she touched the door knob to open he put his finger over the peep hole. My mom froze. She freaked out a little(lot) she grabbed me and my sister grabbed the phone and we went to my sisters bedroom closet. The furthest away from the door. She called 911 and explained what was happening. She sat on the phone for a few minutes they asked if he was still outside, she checked and said yes but this time he was pounding on the door, even the dispatch heard it and said something about it. Few moments after my mom comes back to the closet I heard the dispatcher say they don't have any on duty officers in our area but they're sending one then to check everything out. Still on the phone my mom was told the officer was turning down our street To investigate the area first and then he'll be here to stay on the line. Cop shows up. Checked the property, checked the whole neighborhood, not a soul insight. I think that quick thinking saved my mom from getting pushed in. It was a big issue in our area for a while. We had about 7 the span of 3 months. "
112,"I feel like this is more about your damage control than eating expired food. Firing might be a bit harsh, but your first instinct was to start lying to him so how does he know you're not going to do that with something else?

It was a disaster, but not caused by any flaws in the design. The higher ups told the plant operators to ignore the fucking manual, and keep the turbines spinning as long as they could. To do this the operators had to override saftey mechanisms that would have turned the turbines off. This caused a pressure saftey valve to be deactivated. The valve cause a huge amount of steam buildup, and a chemical explosion ensued. I specify chemical explosion due to the fact that there was not an actual meltdown. Had there been a nuclear explosion, like you get in certain meltdown scenarios, Moscow, and the people who ordered this, would not exist. 

I really get sick and tired of all the false information here. There has only been 1 full meltdown (intentionally caused in a sealed cave), and 1 partial meltdown (three mile island) of any reactor either land or sea based in history, both occurred in the US. Fukushima and Chernobyl were horrible accidents. The former caused by a ""fuck you"" wall of water, aka tsunami. The latter caused by a chemical explosion, caused by idiots.   "
181,Sir Methalot I presume
182,The true Airbender.
183,this had to be the first TIFU story I've actually lol'd at haha~! I'm particularly a fan of your story telling and word choice. (still chuckling over here)
184,"Yeah, but /u/VBgamez seems a bit flaky."
185,I literally quit amphetamines even though I had them prescribed and they were very helpful because no matter what I did I would spend my entire day jerking off.
186,thats not what ur mom said last night
187,"I sort of suspect this is the case but then if I were to go for it again, would this happen again? I feel like it might be worse cause now has the added embarassment from last night."
188,"Perhaps a comfortable cucumber? 
"
189,"Thanks for doing this. Even as someone who *[REDACTED]* myself, it's always incredibly cringeworthy when people just completely derail any and all threads that mention religion because they feel the need to brag about ~~being a teenager~~ how smart they are.

It's honestly nice to see such strict moderating even on a very large sub."
190,"Expelled, ejaculated, what's the difference"
191,the way she goes
192,They are let go after they let go.
193,"Dear lord, 

My nose has always bothered me, and I am considering plastic surgery to improve its appearance.  I don't want to go though with such a superficial operation only for the sake of vanity.  If you could just send me a sign, some way to know that you are ok with this decision, please... -
WHACK!

Amen"
194,"More like you realize how cringey you were a few months ago while continuing to be cringey but in a different way that you'll regret a few months from now, and the cycle continues but longer between each realization."
195,Why didn't you just say you were dabbing and the photo timing made it look like a salute 
196,"So let me get this straight. You befriended a spider named Boris, let his wife Bora move in, then they have children.

At this point Boris and Bora must have grown to trust you and allowed their children to visit you and play with you, only for you to murder all of their children and Boris's wife right in front of him.

No wonder you couldn't find him right away, he was hiding from the monster who he thought was a friend, but then killed his entire family right in front of him.

Then to top it all off you rip off all his legs and send him down the drain where he'll die slowly.

Cruel is too light of a word for the horrendous horrors you've inflicted upon poor Boris and his family, you monster!

Edit: Popped my gold cherry, Thank you kind stranger!"
197,Who's a healthy boy? You are! You are! Look at your coat. It is just shining!

199,"I had a couple of doctors tell me before that their favorite visits are the ones where patients aren't sick in the end, or it's just something simple. That's because 1) it takes the stress off the routine of having to deal with very difficult and serious illnesses 2) makes their work easier. 

Honestly, doctors just want you to be fine. And it's better to say ""well, your chest pain is because you need to burp"" than say ""your heart is failing and you have little time left"". "
200,You sound like a huge mess. I mean honestly how hard can it be to just double check?
201,Same
202,"Don't even feel bad for this one. That just means your dog gets good treats.. I make it a point to at least taste most of my dog's lol some of them are pretty fucking good

Edit: apostrophe ..assholes"
203,Starts throwing cats at cashier 
204,It's Berenstain
205,Aphrodisiac.
206,"&gt;Try ~~not~~ to fart in the confessional

FTFY"
207,Yeah after cooking the food safety regulations are extremely over-cautious so after that point in the story I was wondering how this could possibly go wrong.
208,Sure she does.
209,This kept changing direction so much that I did not fukin see that coming - a real TIFU
210,"Maybe it's just me but, hairy or not, it seems like a gym teacher shouldn't swim with the kids. He should, you know, be acting as a lifeguard or something. "
