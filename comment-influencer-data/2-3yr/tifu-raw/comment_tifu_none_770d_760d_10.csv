What the fuck OP?"
1,"""I hear my mother is going to be out for the entire afternoon. Horny me decides it would be the perfect time to fuck a coconut""

Boy I tell ya, if I had a dollar for every time I had that same thought. "
2,"the sheer look of terror the Reddit co-founder puts on when jimmy starts clicking your username to view your post history as he knows what could end up on live tv.

*nervous sweating*"
3,"Too early to explore space, too late to explore Earth, just in time to read about people fucking coconuts"
4,Quick everyone check his post history!
5,"""he's going to reveal the true nature of my people..""

first comment 'baby, there's nothing micro or soft about me.'

""fuck."""
6,I was worried that your mum was accidentally gonna use the cumconut whilst cooking and serve it as a meal for dinner.
7,"So penetrating a coconut is okay, but penetrating a coconut *raw* was not?"
8,You had a random coconut in your closet?
9,If a hopeless romantic like you who breaks out wine to set the mood for a coconut cant get laid what hope is there for the rest of us
10,"Everybody's in OP's history almost as much as they're in his mom

Edit: Thanks for popping my gold cherry, kind stranger. Luckily my gold hole is still tight, unlike OP's mom."
11,"Was the tree completely removed? tbh I'd complain to the council that the contractors didn't have the correct equipment to stop the tree from falling.

Rather than saying ""I scratched my... pickle."" I'd go with ""though I was asked to help, the tree took more effort to hold that expected and fell.""

I'm sure you could spin it to get the council to sort this out."
12,"""Nah theres no way""

*checks top post of all time*

""Oh shit"""
13,"Don't you?

EDIT: Didn't expect my most upvoted comment to be about coconutting.

EDIT 2: Oh damn, thanks. My first gold!"
14,"Mate, you've just made Reddit history"
15,"Ikr, should've gotten a second coconut "
16,Just did.. that's how I ended up here.. Lol

""And the problem is...what?""

""Good point, guess I'm fucking a coconut.""

The general thought process of the male brain since, well, forever."
19,Now I have to worry about another thing I never knew about happening to me! Yay
20,"[He was right](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6jhf15/comment/djeloz9)

Also, OP should have treated the coconut like condoms, use just once or twice "
21,"If I see even one of you dirty bastards in my local store, I am going to stare at you so hard, shame, shame on all of you cocofuckers. 

Edit: thanks for the kind gold stranger"
22,Hey you stole my job :(
23,"Your boss will probably talk about this with his wife/your ex, but I can't imagine that you will lose your job over this. It might become awkward, though. Truth or not, be sure to know that your ex will inevitably say some things about you, and those things will in turn 'color' your boss's perception of you and may act accordingly. This is like finding an extremely unwanted pin in a haystack you never wanted to be in. "
24,And for once it's not just your mom calling me again! Amazing!
25,You fucked a coconut. Why are you passing judgement on people's ideas?
26,"&gt;Saw the big red button I wasn't supposed to push

29,You know what would be grand? If your landlord had Reddit. And was subscribed to this sub.
30,Upvoted so the kid reads this
31,"I get that your horny brain made you think that fucking a coconut was a good idea, that's not even what surprises me.

But your brain is supposed to return to normal after you blow your load so why did your normal brain tell you ""it's fine to leave an open coconut in a warm room with semen and butter in it"" and most importantly how were you not disgusted at the idea of fapping by using your several days old semen as lubricant ?!"
32,"""Hey, OP, you've got great abs!""

OP: ""What?""

"
33,"&gt;I shaved her


&gt;her"
34,I think my favorite part of the story is the 20 minutes you spent drilling the hole in the coconut. That really show some serious commitment to your goals. 20 minutes prepping a coconut for fornication and at no point do you stop to second guess yourself. Way to stand by your decision. 
35,Honestly thought this was gonna be another cum-coconut story. I'm quite pleased with the fact that it isn't.
36,Instead of shooting my own knee I shot my own head
37,"Should have just explained to the RSO that you were just doing a desk pop.

EDIT: Still a great read, very entertaining."
42,"Jeez Louise, a third one!? Soon we'e going to need a whole subreddit dedicated to having sex with coconuts."
43,"That's what I was waiting for.

Came home ate some coconut chicken dinner with the family.

Went upstairs to visit the wifey. Wifey was not there. "
44,"Also you don't want a bunch of little coconuts showing up at your door, demanding coconut support money. "

48,"I saw it live while my SO was sleeping. I couldn't believe 1-that I recognized all of the posts Jimmy showed 2-that I caught a glimpse of the meth-masturbation title on live TV right before he said ""we're now going down a rabbit hole"". I immediately checked on Reddit if anybody else saw it and posted something about it but I wasn't able to find anything. 

Edit: I know the show is not actually ""live"". I meant during the airing of it. 

Also, I think all of the links were purple when he first showed the front page of the internet. Probably because of ""research"".

Edit 2: amphetamines, not methamphetamines..."
49,"Lmao I didn't notice that, this made me laugh so hard "
50,"To be fair, I think hormonal girls are just as bad.  There's just less evidence, no one suspects them, and they've been conditioned not to admit it like guys do.  Even typing this comment has me questioning whether I should say it or not, but when I was 13, 14, etc, I found inventive uses for bananas, cucumbers, carrots, the handle of my hair brush, the handle of a screw driver, magic markers, even pencils... I could probably go on, but you get the idea.       "

52,If they were latex condoms then the oil in the coconut might have weakened it. If the condom tore then you might have gotten that coconut pregnant.
53,So what you're saying is OP didn't want to become a coco pop?

No need for graphical details thank-you-very-much....."
56,"Reddit both amazes and disturbs me 

On one hand, you have countless subreddits dedicated to things like human progress and mathematical data 

And on the other you have a bunch of degenerates fucking coconuts"
57,"/u/awkwardtheturtle look, someone is actually willing to fuck you"
58,Fucking a coconut is good. Fuck coconuts. Don't just read about people fucking them.

64,"Finally -- a fruit fucking post that didn't end with cringeworthy  genital injury. Congrats, OP. You fucked a coconut and escaped physically unscathed. Using protection was probably a smart idea -- I was reading about guys trying with pineapples and citrus fruits, and all I can think about is how those fruits can actually be really harmful to skin.

71,"Tip from someone who lost it on the other side....you don't really ""get used to it"" with the balance. Prepare to clip door frames and walls for the rest of your life lol. Eventually you just get used to running into things.

77,"So let me get this straight- these guys came to do a job woefully unprepared, were unable to finish the job, and instead of asking for someone else from their business to come help or at least ask you to do the least dangerous job, they ask you to help and force you to do the most dangerous job possible. So much incompetence lol, definitely not your fault."
78,It’s treason then.
79,Yea I know the probability of me losing my job over this is slim. I'm just freaking out a little since everything was going perfect until now. I guess I'm worried about how this will pan out over time.

2. Use a proper sized hole. 

3. Check for allergies before fucking any fruit. 

4. Be careful about which fruit you are using.

EDIT 2: Added links. Note that there was one guy who had a penis sword fight with friend, with their dicks in coconuts. The post is now removed though, possibly because the post was not actually a fuck up (he was just sad that he lost the fight)

I mean, technically you still did fuck shit up, but legally it's probably not your fault. 

Your stupid, stupid fault. /s

But honestly, what would've happened if the tree somehow went the other way, and pinned you or broke a bone? They shouldn't have been doing that shit to begin with, and now will probably be sued for their lack of ability.

I distinctly remember peeing after I scrubbed my dick and seeing a lone, solitary maggot shoot out to its fate into the toilet bowel so yeah, you could say one of them did somewhat succeed. That's partially one of the reasons I puked, combined with the other sensations (the smell especially)"

They come out without the right equipment, cut down the tree in an unsafe manner then ask you as a occupant to come ""hold it up"". Did they check you had safety training? Whether you had any medical conditions? Weren't an idiot who would stop holding the tree to give his tackle a scratching? Did they provide you with safety gear? They're damn lucky you weren't hurt. 

I'd alert your neighbours, tell them you were put in an impossible situation by these fools and together sue the council for their contractors stupidity. I think you should check and discover a sore neck and emotional trauma from your brush with death. Use all the red tape to your advantage. 

Jokes aside - this is their fault, not yours. Councils are meant to ensure they hire trained professionals to do this kind of work, and those guys fucked up by getting you to do this rather than get the proper equipment or.more trained help. "

214,Good way to avoid inheritance tax on all the internet points you have.
215,"Even if it wasn't through the city, you pay a contractor to do a job and you expect that they will have all the equipment and personnel to handle the task. What if he wasn't even home at the time? What would they have done? 

Not to mention, even though he did help out, the liability still falls on the contractor. They're the ones performing the work. The fact that they had to enlist the help of someone not skilled in the profession doesn't mean it's not their responsibility.

If I hire someone to mount a TV on the wall, they don't have enough guys to lift it and ask you to, then you both drop the TV, it's still the contractors fault. He shouldn't have relied on the person that hired him (unless that's in the contract) to supply labor also. "

322,"Ok here's a similar situation which happened to me, but with an unintended consequence. 

At my school in the late 90s we were all given school laptops. I liked to hack around so I modified the boot up sequence on mine to have a photo of one of the mulletsgalore photos with the words ""you wish you were cool like sebeckmas"" or something.  Picture a giant flaming guy with a giant mullet with a huge cheesy grin. 

On some day a few weeks after, I was matched into the head office and was proceeded to be interrogated for ""hacking"" the school network. The principal said ""we know it was you!"" And ""you infected every computer!""  He was livid. And I was shitting myself! (This time) I had no idea what he was talking about and could only mumble responses, but finally managed to get out a ""what did I do?""  The principal then turned his computer monitor around, turned it on and loudly exclaimed ""this!"" as a giant full screen photo of a glorious man with a mullet appeared ""This is on every computer with your name on it!""

Now as it turned out, our school was hit with a virus which wiped out pretty much all the computers - except mine. So the IT guy used my laptop as the new ""master image"" and re-flashed every conputer in the school with mine - including my boot up sequence.  Everyone who turned on their computer was met with this massive photo of a guy with a mullet and a note saying they wish they were as cool as me. 

Fortunately the IT guy worked out what happened and I got away with just the initial berating! 

EDIT: ladies and gents, by popular request I present to you the mullet: http://www.angelfire.com/punk2/nnofx/hair.jpg"

327,"In highschool I would bring my laptop every day. I was the only one who did this. I was always known to be very tech savvy. All the teachers trusted me and so did the schools it person.

So during my time on the school paper, I learned how to add networked printers to a school computer. Turns out the same steps worked on my laptop as well.

Then the county changed how networked printers worked. Instead of each school having it's own print server with all of the schools printers on them, the county connected *every single printer in every school in the entire county* to a single print server. I now had the ability to print anything on any printer in any school in my county/district.

Now we add in that every student starts with a default password of 12345678. Now we add that, while I couldn't access another students networked directory, I could look at the names of the student directories to get usernames. From there I just have to reconnect my laptop to the wifi using random usernames and the 12345678 password until one worked. Not many students changed their password from the default.

Now I had access to any printer, and I could use many different student accounts.
