1,Don't feel bad --  I once drove 13 miles home after work to a house I had not lived in for 3 months.

7,"OP, listen, this is very time sensitive. 

Now we have all heard how call center jobs can be shitty jobs, pun intended. So, the question is, do you like your job, and is your boss a dick?

If you answered no and yes respectively, you need to *shit on your bosses desk*"

Hope your Dad feels better by the way, I know those feels."
9,"Haha ouch. Muscle memory really can get you! I woke up this morning, went to work for an early meeting which lasted all of an hour rather than all day. Went to get the train (going back home from customer site), train was delayed so automatically went into the pub and asked for a vodka cranberry, sat down and realised people around me were eating breakfast...was 9.50am rather than the 5pm is assumed , interesting way to start the day"

16,"All you had to do is remove ""the blunt"" from your sentence.

Don't be so obvious. Talk about it without talking about it.

26,"Poop directly into your other ear for comparison first, though."
27,Had a buddy that used to piss in the closet when he got drunk too. Any closet. Lots of piss. :-|
28,"Dude, I used to work for a call center. Go into whatever Aux code you use for emergencies, tell a sup you're feeling ill, go take care of business, then tell the sup you feel better and get back on the phones. Unless your compliance is way fucked you wont get fired for it."

32,"I work in a dealership too (not in sales) and based on the salespeople I know, reading a text message out loud in front of a customer is playing Russian Roulette at best.  It sounds like he screwed himself on that one."

63,"Last time I got that drunk, I also left my car and took a cab home. Was super lucky, since there were check points along the way. They just waved the cab through, of course. It was convenient since the next day the cab was already on my lawn so I could drive it back to my car. "

I caught myself just in time but I was right there with the bin lid up and my dick out.

101,This!!! Like holy shit squatting on a toilet not designed for it is incredibly dangerous and it's not uncommon for people to be cut from thigh to behind the knee to their waist when they break. Toilets are not designed to carry the entirety of your weight on two pressure points on the rim.

111,"Fire on a plane ain't no joke. 

&gt;On 2 June 1983, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 operating the service developed an in-flight fire behind the washroom that spread between the outer skin and the inner decor panels, filling the plane with toxic smoke. The spreading fire also burned through crucial electrical cables that knocked out most of the instrumentation in the cockpit, forcing the plane to divert to an alternative landing field. Ninety seconds after the plane landed and the doors were opened, the heat of the fire and fresh oxygen from the open exit doors created flashover conditions, and the plane's interior immediately became engulfed in flames, killing 23 passengers who had yet to evacuate the aircraft.

119,"Reminds me of something my buddy did a couple years back. He lived in Montreal, his girlfriend lived in Quebec city ~3 hours away. He'd drive up there every friday night, drive home early monday morning and go straight to work.

One monday morning, it was getting kinda late... 10-11 rolls around and my manager who was sitting right next to me gets a call, chuckles a bit and hangs up. Turns out buddy who left Quebec city took a wrong turn and was half way to New Brunswick before he realized his mistake."

138,"My girlfriend worked at his restaurant for a couple years. When she left she never actually ""left"", they just started leaving her name off the schedule. Gotta $100 gift card in the mail the other day from the company that owns the restaurant and a congratulations on being with them for 5 years. "
139,"You work in a job where you're not allowed to go to the bathroom outside of allotted time slots? Even if it's a case of ""I'm going to shit my pants/throw up everywhere"" ? "
140,"To be fair, if he has that severe of an allergy then he should be paying more attention at a restaurant like that. You didn't mention that he told them about his allergy. Did he? Because if he didn't that's a huge mistake right there."
141,"Aha, I went yesterday and I had a story myself. Wasn't anything that happened to me, I was just an amused observer.

&gt;Worth the trip to subway just to hear the woman in front of me fail to understand the difference between 6 and 12 inches.

&gt;""Excuse me? What?""

&gt;""Sorry, did you want a six inch, or a foot long""

&gt;""I don't know what that means.""

&gt;...

&gt;...

&gt;""Do you want a big sandwich, or a small sandwich?""

&gt;She actually got increasingly infuriating. To the point where, while attempting to make her second sandwich, the man behind the counter decided that he'd had quite enough and walked away.

&gt;Another guy in the back caught him and asked him where he was going - without a response. My eyes were following upset sandwich man, so the new guy exchanged a cursory glance with me while he realised what had happened, and had to come take his place to resume sub-par sandwich production. 

&gt;It was great."
142,"Bear repellent is serious stuff.  It's pepper spray.  The stuff cops use.  Same thing.    In Canada it is considered a prohibited weapon if used against a person, even in self defense.  There are no personal defense pepper spray for civilians here.

anyway... the bear spray stuff is generally better than most ""put in your purse"" type jobbies.  So anyway...  I ended up finding some in the street a year or three ago.  Plastic wrap, orange safety clip still zip-tied down on it and all.  Very grenade like.

On the can it says it has an EFFECTIVE range of 18 feet.    It has 0.857% capsaicin and 0.753% capsaicinoids.  It empties the can (think spray-paint sized) in 8 seconds.  That's a LOT of hot stuff.

Doing this in an enclosed space would be a very very terrible idea.  It would SERIOUSLY endanger the lives of the people on board, no question.

Also they're extremely flamable and explosive.... being aerosol cans and all.

oh and you gotta show ID, and the store you buy it from keeps you on file, how much you bought, address, etc etc..  dunno why but I looked it up when I found the can of spray.  Better me find it than some kids.

I wake up to some rustling and this big sigh of relief as I start hearing the piss hit the speaker.

206,"Did something like this to one of my friends in high school. He liked to experiment with different drugs, so being the funny man I am, I gave him an herbal laxative while my friends backed me up saying it was a new drug on the streets. About 45 minutes later we're finishing up our dinner at mcdonalds when his flood gates open up. He was on that toilet for almost an hour. "

Next time, sing ""Here I Go Again"" whilst rocking back and forth, then cough and bang on the side of the stall whilst doing your best chewbacca impression. This releases the poop into the toilet bowl. Works every time."

So while walking to work i ran into some friends and stayed to chat for a bit and have a few smokes.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.

The bee, of course, flies anyway.

Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

222,"They're two different drugs.

Cannabis vs Alcohol is a dead debate, it isn't logical to compare them since you behave very differently on them.

**But I totally understand your point and here comes some words to all work smokers**

I live in a place in Europe where it's allowed to smoke weed at home and buy it at dispensaries. It has become quite a bad habit because I've lived here for 5 months and I've probably smoked at least one time everyday except one or two.

While I do enjoy smoking it and I'm aware I smoke way too much but still. I would never, ever in my life come into work stoned and everyone of my friends that smokes would never do that either.

I know you probably don't do this but to everyone else, please do not assume that everyone that smokes is like OP, that we forget everything and smokes before work.

This is a completely unnesserary post but I just feel like the loudest cannabis smokers are often the douchebags who treat it like some miracle medicine and smokes it before work and keeps arguing that ""It's not like alcohol so I can do my job at the same time"".

Well yes you can, but you're not 100% focused and efficient. You do get paid to do your best work after all, so respect your employer and do your job. Smoke when you get home instead.

Also we (me as well) who smoke pot should stop joking around about it as soon as we do stupid shit. Way too many ""I was stoned so I did this"" stories.

It's not interesting, not funny. Quite sad when you think about it. And yes, you do stupid things when you're under the influence of all drugs. But just because it's pot doesn't mean it's OK, cool or funny. It's a drug and if you can't behave without hurting yourself, anyone else or even your wallet then you might have a problem.

Also we who smoke pot have to learn and accept that other people do not like Marijuana for their own personal reasons. Please stop questioning, arguing or even accusing people who don't like it. I mean if someone at work would talk about any other drug it wouldn't be okay at all, what makes pot so ""okay""?

Sometimes the only reason we even find out about a domestic is because of concerned neighbors. There's nothing at all wrong with calling the police because you're legitimately concerned. You did the right thing. "
