0,This could be a whole episode of Seinfeld.
1,"G: Jerry, the guy thinks I'm Muslim.

J: who does?

G: the lunch guy at work. He won't let me have bacon with my breakfast. Took my plate from me.

J: but you *love* bacon!

G: Love the bacon!

J: and you can't have bacon?

G: Can't have the bacon! Jerry, I'm screwed. Muslim!?

J: How in the world did he get that impression?

G: It's the beard Jerry. Nothing but trouble. Should never have grown it.

J: I tried to tell you. Why do you think I shave? 

E, from couch: Bad Jew?

J, snears: Yeah, okay, bad Jew. Forget I said that. 

J, back to G: ...You know, now you have to follow through.

G: Oh I'm following through. Huh-ho, am I ever following through. I'm going all out for this one.

E: ...Ramadan is coming up.

G, takes off glasses and rubs his eyes: Guess I have to quit.

J: You could just shave.

G: and let him win?

K, bursts through door, full beard and towel wrapped on his head straight out of the shower, looks at G: Anyone ever tell you you look like a muslim with that beard?

Everyone looks back and forth to K and G.

K: not seeing the irony: Jerry, can I borrow your conditioner, this beard takes work. Used all mine up.

J throws up his hands and let's out an exasperated sigh. K runs into the bathroom. /Scene

------------------

EDIT: 

G: GOLD! They gave me gold Jerry! 

J: what is this, the wild west? Who uses gold?

E, imitating an old prospector: there's gold in them there comments!

J, G: No, don't do that again.

K: I keep all my cash in gold. Awaiting the * *squiggles hand in the air, makes a popping noise* * apocalypse. It's coming. George, stock up. It'll be worth millions when the money becomes useless.

E: millions of what?

K gets wide eyed and bursts back out the door to his apartment. /Scene

-----------

Edit 2:

K runs inside the apartment and slams the door, peering through the peep hole.

J, E look back and forth to each other.

J: Kramer?

K shushes him, still staring through the peep hole.

J, getting dressed: Kramer, what's going on?

K: too much gold, Jerry. 

J: not possible.

E: didn't you say you were saving up for the apocalypse?

K, almost whimpering: they found out.

J: who found out? What are you talking about? 

K, pulls out a telescope and places it against the peephole: Pirates!

J flings his hands: there's no such thing.

K: oh yes there is, Jerry. And they know I have more gold.

K turns around, sees J in his puffy shirt and stumbles, knocking over everything on the counter. K does a spin, points at J and mumbles, then runs out of the apartment. G is walking in, wearing an eyepatch after his fight with the food guy resulted in bacon grease to the eye and the guy getting let go for racial discrimination. K points, spins and stumbles back into his own apartment. /Scene

[Damn, guess you liked it. Just to clear things up, no I'm not Larry David, just watched Seinfeld religiously from ages 7-18, daily. I know most muslims don't wear turbans, but the show would have used the sight gag. Thank you all for your comments and gold.]"
2,"I'm a firefighter.   Went to a house fire started by a cat.   The owners said the cat used to sleep on the stovetop because the pilot light was warm.   Awwww.    So cute, isn't it?

Until one day a cat fireball went running through the house setting shit on fire.  "
3,"Home from school, sick in bed

Fever, cough, and achy head

Horny, bored and home alone

Strips himself to bounce his bone

In a cup, he shoots his cum

Leaves it near the couch for mum

Mother's back and wants a drink

Doesn't smell the water's stink

Drinks the water, starts to squint

""Did you get this shit from Flint?""

Though it was a semen shot

He told his mom it was his snot



"
4,"It might not be too late. Sneak out, get an identical second container of tea. and stash it in the back of the cupboard. That's your Tea. Your boss messed up and tagged the wrong one. Go now, escape the bathroom in the chaos. You can do it. 

Edit: Gold Tea, Best Tea."
5,"*looks at you*

*coldly picks up intercom*

""Clean up on aisle 4"""
6,"the jello wasnt the explosive part it was dropping ice cubes in the super hot water that did it.

wow my top comment:

no I'm not a chef or an o-chem student or anything. I mostly know this because of the old troll of heating up a spoon or other metal utensil then telling people to run it under cold water. Some poor fuck got shrapnel all in his hand. "
7,"She knew

Edit: My highest rated comment is on a post about a guy's mom drinking his semen. Thanks reddit."
8,"Enough internet for today.

Edit: Thanks for the gold."
9,Now you have one more thing in common with your father ;-) 
10,"that's exactly why I drink coffee in the morning.

EDIT: hey, my first gold. Thanks stranger"
11,"Man. I'm so sorry, dude. I can't even imagine how fucking frustrating that is. Jesus Christ. You'll make it through this, though. Keep your head up and good luck. 

Edit: some of the comments on here are so nasty and rude. Y'all need to chill. Why would you want to rub it in his face? I swear, some of y'all just live to upset people and is fucking disgusting. "
12,You should refrain from having kids for a while.
13,tifu by sexing the sexy sex too much sex
14,"Jesus christ man when i read the title i though you actually managed to close your butthole

Edit: really guys this is my top comment"
15,I am just glad my cat never figured out how to light a match...
16,"&gt; She was extremely disgusted and pissed at me. 

Yeah... "
17,"Licks her lips, smiles at the door.

""Darling do you have any more?"""
18,"It's not your fault. You did not tell your boss to write that message on the tea, nor did you tell your coworker to drink while on the job. You are not responsible "
19,"I used to have a murderous feline as well. We had guests over and it climbed up the stairs to the mezzanine level and pushed down a potted plant which we placed at the edge to make things look pretty. It smashed down right next to where my cousin was sitting missing him by inches. There were many pots right there but it chose the one that would fall on the guy. The cat conceived, planned and nearly executed the perfect murder.  "
20,Defacing tea in the UK is punishable by life imprisonment or death by hanging. Your boss should lie low for a while.
21,"Didn't your parents tell you ""Be careful or your face might get stuck that way""?"
22,Oh God that's horrific. I mean who in their right mind just discards ice cream like that.. You barbarian. 
23,Too soon
24,"He smiles back, cause what's the harm?
He didn't even break his arms. "
25,You seem really butthurt.
26,"Sorry for saying this, but more likely than not, your mom knows what semen taste like"
27,"I searched through my car and scrapped together enough coins to pay for it. There is one of two lessons here and I'm trying to figure out which. 

Lesson 1 - keep some money in your car, or 
Lesson 2 - lose enough money in your car and don't clean the inside too often."
28,"Wait...why didn't you use the shower to get them off?


EDIT: my first 1000+ comment. Thanks!"
29,What an oddly specific reason to drink coffee.

31,I'm not Muslim!  ...Not that there's anything wrong with that!
32,"&gt; G: Love the bacon!

On point. That one line made it real for me."
33,"We've beaten this horse well past dead

34,Stories like these are why I can't read this sub very often. This is 95% a bad erotic novel and 5% actual story.
35,Duuuuuuuuuude.
36,"This hurt to read but it sure as heck sounds like a love story tbh. 

The bus driver should be held some sort of responsibility though. "
37,"I just couldn't save anything that day. People, ice cream, my public image... I should find another line of work "
38,[removed]
39,"That's genius.  You've been involved in tea-related todayIfuckeduperry before, haven't you?"
40,"""Johnson, what are you reading?""

""I.. uh.. it's..""

""Oh. *Letting my mum drink my own semen*... Carry on Johnson, keep up the good work."""
41,How the fuck if this *kind of* NSFW!?
42,"Now you have a sweet (a little salty as well) comeback when you fight with your dad. ""Oh ya dad, well ask your girl how my cum taste."" 

Edit: make sure you have enough money to move out after. "
43,Examsoft? It was Examsoft wasn't it? I HATE that program 
44,"It's both. Lesson one is the dream, lesson two is the reality."
45,You should have pointed it at the her and said...this is a stickup
46,"If you change your mind and do ask, break your arms first. 
"
47,And I only just started ._.
48,this is so ridiculous it sounds like a plot line from The Office.
49,Some moms don't like to ingest their son's mouth babies.

54,"Because he was done showering &amp; it was time to towel dry, of course."
55,"""No, in fact I'm at my desk wondering what I'm going to do for Ramadan.""

Priceless :') "
56,"But what happened?!?!  

You left?  You ran?  You got your ass kicked?  The clerk paid for you?  ???"
57,Did you make this up because you wanted to use that clever TL;DR?
58,"And, three hours from now...

""TIFU by thinking an old lady on a scooter died in aisle 4""."
59,"Hmmmm....how would that play out in a court of law if the cat killed your friend do you think?

If it was a dog and it bit and killed them, then yea it's the dogs fault and maybe you put the dog down because intent is pretty clear.

But with the cat knocking off the plant...you'd have to assess the cat's intent on killing your friend. Like how would we discern if the cat WANTED to kill your friend or if he just wanted to knock over the plant? 

Or would it be well you placed the plant there knowing your cat gets into shit so you are ultimately responsible via negligence...but if the cat had no history of doing random stuff like that, and this was a one time incident...who is at fault?

Lawyers of Reddit?"
60,"So you think, that's plan B."
61,Not planning on asking her though
62,"IT WAS THE CLASSIC THING TO DO
"
63,I'm glad that someone else here knows the pain of Examsoft.
64,Honest tea is the best policy. 
65,Chef verified!
66,Atleast you have access to internet and Reddit.....I hope you have power and more importantly you brought your charger!
67,Imagine if the lady fell asleep by the time they got to her and jerked when they touched her 
68,You don't choose the halal life halal life chooses you
69,Be careful about labeling tea 'fruity'.  Look what happened to OP.
70,"They've been calling me crazy for years but finally it happened to somebody.

Now who's the crazy one, Janice?"
71,"My favorite part is that your dog has a nest.

72,You can have my Reddit username if you want.
73,Don't jizz were you eat
74,"I shared a hospital room with a Muslim guy in a *very* conservative state and was shocked when I saw him eating all sorts of haram things. When I asked about it, he said that the Quran says it's okay to eat pork, et cetera, when it's a matter of survival, and that he was too afraid to tell hospital staff that he's Muslim because he was afraid of mistreatment.  I went to the nurses' station, asked for halal meals, and asked them to send the chaplain to bring me a Quran.  At mealtimes, we'd trade food; the chaplain was initially confused when I told him that I'm a devout atheist, but came around quickly with an explanation.

It's shameful to think that we, as Americans, live in a country where certain people are afraid to be who they are.  We can do better.

75,I thought he was doing some kind of *shitty* self-surgery.
76,"Ants are vicious bastards. I had one, unknown to me, hitch a ride on my shoe, climb all the way up the inside of my jeans, wait till I was in the supermarket surrounded by people and bite me right in the arsecrack."

78,How is a Cell Phone like Anal Bleaching? They both let you change your ring tone.
79,"I was in your exact same situation minus the computer issues. My test was given on a scan tron, and I just strait up failed a year of pathology by one point.  Out of a total of 1000 cumulative points over the year, my friend had one more point than me in pathology at the end of finals and he passed, so very clearly, I was the cut off for failing.  They told me at the same committee meeting that I had to take my entire second year over--every damn class I already passed, including and in addition to pathology as well as pay another 50,000 for the privilege of doing so.  I had to meet with the same committee of professors, deans and student representatives you mentioned.  In reality like many things in life, the committee and it's members do not really care whether you stay and complete another year, or drop out--it's your life.   Your professors and dean will not be affected by your situation-- it couldn't affect them less.  I arranged emergency meetings with several different professors who I trusted to get their take on my situation having been in academics for decades and having seen this before.  I also forced a meeting with the dean who's secretary said he was too busy, but I waited outside his office for hours until he came out.  He didn't know my name before, and he didn't remember my name afterwards or ever having met me (evident during my eventual graduation).  The committee won't remember your name either in a year or two.  But for you this period of time can be true hell.  For me it was a dark period of my life--those weeks or months where my fate was undetermined and in the hands of a group of strangers who had no incentive to deviate from protocol in determining my fate.  I was told at that committee meeting that in no case in the history of my med school, has the committee ever recommended a different practice besides repeating the year--this is a hundred years of precedent, so it's almost like these meetings are conducted as an exercise in academic policy which has no effect on the actual outcome of the meeting.  My med school friends all started their clinical year while I was still in purgatory.  They moved to different cities to do their rotations while I stayed home in my apartment.  Everyone's life moved on and they had nothing to say to me anymore, after all why should they care that you've created a shit storm for yourself?  I felt like I was left behind by life while my friends and family continued on the path their lives were supposed to follow.  Then and even now nearly a decade later, I equate that period time to being diagnosed with a terminal disease.  I know that sounds absurd, and of course it is not the same.  Still you are plucked from the path of your life and you are forced into a situation which is uncertain while the lives of your friends and family continue without you.  As a medical student who already has 200,000 of debt, another 50,000 tuition added to 20,000 for another year's cost of living really weighs heavy on a young 20 something year old person.   I thought briefly of suicide as a way out of the the whole situation, so to those who would scoff at the situation, my analogy to a terminal disease might be closer than you realize.  I think the perspective this experience gave me was the only benefit I got out of this whole experience--to understand for the first time what it is like to be told relatively unexpectedly that your life is going to take a different path, and the separation this will cause between you, your family, your class and friends.  Also seeing how little the problems in your own life affect the lives of the people around you--your dean, your professors, your close friends and your family far away on the other side of the country.  My mother was the only one who could hear the pain in my voice, and she offered to fly to be with me, but realizing that would not help get me out of the situation, I told her to stay home.  

What became of me and what will become of you?  I will leave the details of my life out of the story because this story is about you.  I graduated, I'm a physician and everything is fine.  It took me 5 years to do medical school instead of 4.  I paid off all my loans a year or two ago.  Your life can be fine as well.  But I walk away with the knowledge that we are fragile individual creatures--quite easily disrupted by life events, illness, and many things both in our control and outside of it.  Ultimately when something like this happens, it affects you and can change your perspective on life, and can change the way you view what it means to really care about those around you.  I think it can help to shine the lens on what it really means to give a shit about another person.  Showing up to a committee meeting because you are the student body representative and this is one of your responsibilities, is not truly caring for someone, just like showing up to an O.R. or clinic to see the patient's you have scheduled is not caring for someone.  These are the motions, but having and maintaining empathy for other people and not letting the monotony and bureaucracy and annoyances of human tenancies destroy that empathy is what I took away from my situation."
80,I feel like this is your moms tifu; not yours. Who drinks from an almost empty glass that a sick person drank from without confirming what it is? Or even just drinks from a sick person's glass?!
81,"&gt;  i dont think she ever wants to see me again.

some flowers would work and next time your on a bus together break your own nose and fracture her skull, that way you have matching stories "
82,somehow that is really incredible..... I take it you didn't eat a mentos mint after the vomit to help with the after taste? 
83,"As a Muslim, TIL that there are actually people in this world that PRETEND to be Muslim to get BETTER food or food of their preference. I'm sitting here baffled with my mouth open."
84,"I like to imagine the point where you make eye contact, spoon inches away from your mouth. You can almost see the word ""DONT"" spell out on your bosses face as you inch it closer. He wants to put out a hand to stop you, but no force on earth has the power to defy ice cream. "
85,"Reply to the group chat ""tell your boyfriend to help with the chores..."""
86,"When I was a baby, I had diarrhea in the bath &amp; my grandma's pug Dudley hopped in. My dad proceeds to vomit into the sink while in the phone with my mom who was at work. 

That's one of my favorite stories of my dad. He always retched at anything remotely gross."
87,"So, Piotr got really... forked up?

Seriously though, this was a load of bad decisions all around, with yours only being a mild flub vs boss's inappropriate workplace etiquette vs Piotr's breakdown.  Don't beat yourself up, but do try to duck out without being seen.  Give your boss a chance to cool down first, so he doesn't do something irrational out of embarrassment."
88,"As much as i would like to agree to the first part, i dont think she ever wants to see me again. 

As for the second part nobody really wants to tell the bus driver that he drives like a fuckin idiot because the bus drivers have full authority to remove you from the bus if they deem it necessary. And ofc a power like that could be and is abused. "
89,if he wanted his comeback he would wipe it off his mums chin
90,"I love the britishness of this. I picture you getting locked out in nothing but your ""pants"" thinking ""FUCKSHITBOLLUCKS!"" but muttering ""oh, bother."" quietly to yourself instead. "
91,Maybe your imperial butt was incompatible with the metric bidet.
92,And then she went out into the hallway and furiously masturbated while swishing it around. Praying to god that her son broke his arms sometime in the near future.
93,*spreads sawdust*
94,"It'd be worth taking up with your department head, school's ombudsman, etc.  

I'd stress 1) the accident, 2) it's proximity to your test, 3) your subsequent unfamiliarity with the new computer, it's display, and the possibiilty you weren't seeing a full screen, 4) the tiny amount of the failure percentage, and 5) the huge personal cost in terms of time (1 year), money (65k), and lower opportunities at residency time.

Especially if your prior grades have been very good, I'd stress the last point.  Their mission is to turn out excellent doctors.  They shouldn't allow bureaucratic rigidity to take this accident's ramifications which resulted in a tiny score miss to prevent you from having a top-notch and challenging  educational experience as a resident, not to mention the personal cost.  Nor will you learn more by retaking the class.  So having you re-take it will not further your education or skill as a doctor.  The fact is, the test was not a good indicator of your knowledge, solely based on its format.

Definitely persistently chalkenge the decision, albeit humbly.  Good luck."
95,"This reads like a law school exam question!

103,"My younger brother was deep frying chicken in a pot with oil one time and decided that the oil was too hot because his first batch came out burnt. He turned the stove down and then I saw him go to the freezer and grab a handful of ice cubes and start walking back towards his pot of boiling oil. I was hung over as fuck but I managed to jump up from my chair and slap his hand right as he was about to drop the ice cubes into the oil. He gave me a what the fuck look and I had to explain to him why that was a terrible fucking idea. He didn't believe me that the oil would explode on him and possibly burn the fuck out of him because the ice cubes would almost instantly turn to steam so I grabbed a smaller pot heated up some oil took it outside had him follow me and tossed an ice cube in it from a distance and watched it explode. His jaw dropped and I told him it would have been so much worse if he dropped the 10 or so ice cubes into the pot he had. 

That is the story of how I taught my brother about kitchen safety."

108,"Raise hell. Escalate it.  Send an email asking for an appeal. Call their office daily and ask if XYZ reason is possible to appeal it. 

Schedule a meeting with the president, the dean, the chair, your professor. The board, other random boards. 

Go to the professor's office hours until they tell you to f*ck off trying to find loopholes. 

I got slightly screwed over by my school. I raised hell (very,very nicely) and made it a point to spend 1-2 hours a day emailing and talking to people. They solved my problem to get rid of me. 

Make this such a big issue that they simply give you 0.5% to your grade to pass you. 

Ask for documentation. Blame the technology software and email the vendor. 

All you have to do is be a bigger pain in the ass then this is worth to them for them to pass you. 

This is $65 grand and one year of your life.

174,"During a track meet, my fellow competitors (my team and others) all sat in the grass to wait our turn. Unfortunately, I sat in an anthill and began spazzing out, jumping around, and swatting myself in the groin, putting on a huge riot for anyone watching.

My coach laughed and asked if I was doing some exotic new warm up exercise.

At least 2 others got up and had to do the same before word got around how bad the ant hill was. There was like 5 different holes they were pouring out."

And she didn't instantly spit it out?  

Your mom knows what cum tastes like. So she knew it was your cum and just gulped it down? Secondly how did she not smell it before she sipped it? Cum has a pretty distinct odor. "
177,"This one time in college my roommate challenged me to chug the remaining liter of a half full 2 liter bottle of coke.  I was so quick and skillful (I was a champion shotgunner) that 2/3 of it went down with barely any fizzing.  Big mistake.  I stopped, looked at him and said ""I fucked up"", then spewed a perfectly silent fountain of foam all over the floor."

181,"Shitting in the shower

Multitasking power

Toilets are so overrated

Flushing's over-complicated

Needs to empty out his bowels

Has no time for clothes and towels

Spreads his cheeks over the drain

And from his ass, he makes it rain

Stinky mud, from the sky

Watch his feces multiply

On the drain, log by log

Team to make the perfect clog

H2O and number two

Mix and form a shitty stew

Mashes crap to no avail

In the tub, his mudclots sail

On his toe

A hellish foe

His own secretions love him so

Showers have a single use

Wash yourself, don't drop a deuce"

Drinking at work, no matter the circumstances, is completely unprofessional, and to then operate a forklift is downright negligent (And completely illegal in the states, don't know about where you are). 

The guilt for this lies not on your shoulders, but on Piotr, for not only reacting poorly, but for making terrible choices in response. Your boss could shoulder some blame, as he should know better than to put on paper something so unprofessional, but he didn't hand Piotr that drink, and he certainly didn't give him reason to destroy property."

222,"Once, in second grade, I decided to finally help an ant after years of squishing these little bastards with my shoe. I protected it from my friends' soles, and tried to carry it on a stick with me to class when all of a sudden the ant fucking LEAPED on my finger and bit it. 

In my life, I have *never* felt a more excruciating pain than that. I started howling around and started wildly moving my finger around t get the ant off. The ant stayed put, mandibles still stuck in my finger when I decided that I had had enough and just squished the ant to death. I then ripped its body off my finger and flung it far away, never to be seen again.

I will never help another ant again. Those fucking backstabbers."

We go and the host sits us down. The waiter then pulls up our last name by room number. When he approaches me, he says my last name questionably. I'm like ""Yeah?"" Then he's like ""Asalamalekun"" and I replied with ""Wa alikum Salam"" because I've heard it in a Rick Ross song before.

296,"Well damn.... I knew this a while ago, but a want to forget so hard. When I first discovered masturbation ( I don't know when exactly, but I did some non traditional masturbation before puberty and by the sixth grade I moved on to the traditional way) I masturbated a lot. I mean a lot. It started once before school once after school. Then once an hour after school.... anyway, I would do the deed and let it just cream my underwear. Based on the knowledge of now. I would go to class smelling of one cream, then to taekwondo practice smelling of 5 creams. I would notice that, around that time I smelled a little different, but I chopped it of as me just smelling different because puberty... and because, to me, It smelled of mild bleach, so why would anyone else consider what what it was. 

If I keep getting reminded of this fact that adults know what sex and cum smell like, I'm going to spend a lot if my time cringing at my younger years. Fuck man stop reminding me.... damn I hate my younger self for being a dumbasses and making me feel like this.
