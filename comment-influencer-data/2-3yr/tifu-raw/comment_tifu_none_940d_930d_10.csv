3,That went better than I expected.
4,"&gt; Going to do another this weekend if it drops another 10 degrees

The real TIFU is always in the comments."
5,"That's nothing a tourist could be expected to know. :( ...

In Canada there's a strong culture of the public quickly reporting thugs taking advantage of a riot. I remember the [Stanley Cup riot of Vancouver in 2011](http://globalnews.ca/news/2763636/looking-back-5-years-since-stanley-cup-riot/).

Canadians were absolutely appalled by it. So much so that a web site created by the police for the public to submit pictures and evidence of suspected rioters was inundated by Canadians.

That public cooperation contributed to:

&gt; In the end, 300 alleged rioters, including 54 youths, faced 912 charges. All but 16 of the accused pleaded guilty.

A number of the rioters ended up making public apologies for their behaviour.

Law and order is not just the police's job. Everyone has a duty to expose thuggery, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the only way to avoid down the shitter of indifference toward living in a society where only heavy handed police action controls the festering violence."
6,"'I opted to eat a couple while still standing next to her'

clear priorities. good man."
7,Pretty sure this is just a lesson on how you should never get in a car with a stranger
8,The Uber driver should have had a SIGN in his car: 'DRIVER IS HEARING IMPAIRED'.
9,"Let me reassure you: ""VAG JUICE"" is safe, even when consumed regularly."
10,Sadly a face I see far too often.
11,"Nice TIFU, Mary Poopins."
12,Hahaha you evil bastard haha
13,That's the face of regret. 
14,"Sounds like dude was looking for any reason to fire you if you've worked there for 3.5 years but he's not going to give you a warning for taking one euro. He probably could've taken it out of your next check too. 

Technically speaking you are in the wrong but for one euro? It was an overreaction on his behalf. "
15,"Now, I'm no engineer, or plumber, but that intake seems awfully large...
And it was just the one? That doesn't seem very safe..."
16,"This is probably the most metal TIFU I've ever read. Carrying your girlfriend through a riot in a cloud of tear gas before being robbed and having your nose smashed. Sorry to hear you had to go through that, and I'm glad to hear you guys are safe and sound now!"
17,"Still wondering how the conversation with the roommate went. 

""Hey dude,  I am naked at my office because I wanted to take a picture with a temperature board. Please come help me. ""

Friend - "" lmao. "" *hangs up*"
18,"I know you aren't looking for advice, but go in person and apologize to the Asian chef guy and then your boss.  You'd be surprised how much body language can make a difference and making the effort might at least save your future"
19,"Phone died when it was being taken and the photo was never successfully recorded. I gave it to the guy and had to wait my turn due to the line, which was about 10 minutes. 

When it's that cold, your phone stops working in minutes. My phone will die within a 30-minute Cross Country ski session in my pocket when it's at 50% under 0F.

Going to do another this weekend if it drops another 10 degrees"
20,"I'll be honest, I expected it to be alot worse with the title.

Okay didn't expect this to become my top comment... "
21,Oh God.  Not your sisters tho
22,All I can think of is the episode from Arrested Development where Michael picks up that random Latino woman who doesn't speak English and he keeps making hand gestures like he's going to kill her. 
23,"No kidding, I think dude took blaming the dog to an entirely new level. "
24,Keep going I'm almost there 
25,"It probably broke because she sprayed a fire extinguisher at an electronic device, not because of cookie dough."
26,5 out of 10 Dentist recommend vag juice to fight cum disease.
27,The real LPTs are always in the comments. 
28,...can we see the picture?
29,What are you saying against my sister? She's healthy! She keeps herself clean! Some people. :-(
30,"""It was tremendous, such a large poo. Believe me, it was substantial."" ......I know it, you know it, we ALL know it. lol I read that in Trump's voice. "
31,That makes me love Canadians more than I already do hahha
32,They call that a hot tub? It's a tiny bath!
33,"&gt; I wanted to stay dry so I started hopping down the dirt road in my sleeping bag 

wutface"
34,"I mean, you didn't think to say, ""Oh, no! I accidentally dropped it in the toilet! I wouldn't use it..."" ??"
35,"Holy shit! I was there too: showed up late and got in the midst of the riot, but I was lucky enough to get out of there without any injuries. This just reminds me of what could have happened. O.O Glad you guys are ok now!"
36,"Use your girlfriend's foundation makeup - even if the texture looks a little odd, it should normalize the color"
37,"yes we are still very much together, the fact that she willingly continued with our trip after all of this, hobbling around with a knee brace, still blows my mind."
38,"I had an Uber with a hearing impaired guy a few months back. Uber notified me he was hearing impaired as soon as he was on his way to pick me up. Plus it was pretty obvious once you got into the car. 

After a few drinks though, I could see how you could oversee it. 

But that dude was probably one of my favorite Uber drivers. He was insanely nice and still blared music. He claimed to just like the feel of the beat. "
39,"Yea I know right, there was only 1.
here's the warning and the intake is in the bottom left.
http://imgur.com/a/BKOHE"
40,Holy shit. It looks like I'm the first to comment but I don't know what to say. This is real r/TIFU material. This belongs at the top of all time. Are you okay? What's your current status with everything?
41,A Jacuzzi is a brand name. A hot tub is a type of tub.
42,"Woulda been more exciting if Liam Neeson showed up getting chased by a carnivorous pack of wolves...

But alas... naked man shaking uncontrollably is enough to satisfy my sick mind.  Upvote for you, shriveled penis man."
43,You like that you fucking retard?
44,"Had he used one of his fries to wipe a dab of mustard off of her face and then popped it in his mouth, I'd be bowing to him.."
45,If it makes you feel any better...I did not know what a space cake was until now
46,"Pretty much. My roommate enjoys humor like this, so he gave me shit for a while. The fact that he came out that late with clothes means he's a great friend though."
47,Can't you book another flight? Fly separately if you have to. Meet up at the destination?
48,"Found the guy who punched you, OP! We did it! "
49,that's called Tuesday in Paris.
50,"I would add that if you want to apologize, do it for the right reasons.  Don't go there to apologize hoping it will save you, that is even more selfish and rude, it's also easy to tell when people are only doing something to benefit themselves.  

I would go to your ex-boss first and tell them that you know you fucked up, and explain to them what happened and that you would like to go aplogize in person, and ask for their blessing to go apologize first.  You insulted someone (I'm assuming) you have never actually met before, and there is a chance that going directly to them would only make the situation worse for your boss and his relationship with this other chef.

Don't ask what you can do to make up for it, don't ask for their forgiveness and don't go aplogize on a work level, you hurt this person on a personal level and by association made your boss look terrible.  But most of all, just don't bother if you're only reason for doing it is to get your job back because they will see right through that and it will be obvious."
51,"""And son, this is why you should never trust a stranger."""
52,TIL -40F is -40C
53,"""Oh no! Don't use that I accidentally dropped it in my vagina.""


""whaaaaaaa"""
54,"If you have time in the morning, head to a Sephora and pick up Kat Von D Lock it Tattoo Concealer. Get them to help you apply it. It'll cover it up."
55,Racist
56," You should have hung up the phone and denied getting it. Hell throw your phone out and get a new one, claim it got stolen"
57,"Once I was waiting to pick up a friend at the local light rail station and had some woman I didn't' know climb in back seat.  She kind of glared at me when I didn't immediately take off.  I said ""I think you are in the wrong car,""  she rolled her eyes and jumped out -and slammed the door."
58,"In case your sister ever does anything disgusting to you, you have a hidden card under your sleeve. "
59,"Actually, this is a great example of how even strangers can be trusted.  I mean, OP did apologize and return them immediately! LOL"
60,"..YOU..ARE..GROSS..

64,This story belongs to /nosleep.
65,we're okay! back in the states safe and sound and still very pleased with our trip &amp; experiences in Europe overall. My girlfriend's knee is perfectly fine and my schnozz is still kinda messed up but whatever. I still cope with some anger and anxiety that stems from this experience but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger :)
66,"Well that, in addition to the fact that he cooks every night and is a solid ethical person in general... I'd say that he's a great friend."
67,"Way to think on your feet, not the shitting in the back yard part, the roommate cleaning up part."
68,Yeah you basturd
69,i didnt think of that all the way through reading until i read this comment and she only had like a second probably. youre a smart cookie

71,My penis was sad
72,"I wish. I looked at every single available flight. It would be 1098 for him to get there in time and we definitely do not have that kind of cash at the moment.

77,"Not too related but a funny pseudo-similar story a friend told me about a trip to New Orleans.  He was out drinking late and needed to get back to his hotel on the other side of town.  He steps to the curb and goes to flag a taxi, a guy pulls over and he gets in and (pretty buzzed, not paying much attention) he tells them his destination.  They drive, chat, he said the guy was very friendly (my friend is as well) and after 10-15 minute drive they get to his destination.  He goes to get out and asks the guy what he owes him and he tells him nothing.  My buddy chuckles and says something about not being a good way to make money as a taxi driver.  The guy says, ""Ha, I'm not a taxi driver!"" After some confusion he asks the guy why he pulled him over and picked him up.  The guy tells him, ""You just looked like a nice guy that needed a ride."""
78,"Found except from OP's comment history: ""My ex used to love that. I'd offer her a massage every other week when she came home. It helped her sort of de tangle until I ripped off her underwear with my teeth and shoved my face so far up her ass I could almost swear I saw communist China. She was Lil kinkster that one""

I think i see the problem here."
79,An insensitive dick head?
80,You should see Wednesday in Glasgow
81,"Read this as ""blowing him"" at first. I'm going to continue reading it as that "
82,But how are his blowjobs?
83,"""fuck the phone"" pretty much sums up the situation.  Glad you're safe.
"
84,"&gt; Oh God.  Not your sisters tho

Trust me, his sisters juice is safe, tastes like pear juice mmmmmm

"
85,Fucking rude lmao
86,"&gt; apologized to the adult leaders, who understood and gave me blankets to cover up with

87,"&gt;This is something I will take to my grave.

88,"I'm gonna be real here, you deserved it."
89,I'm potty training my 2 year old. After several falling into the toilet incidents I caved and bought one of those little baby potties. She was pooping while my boss came over for coffee to chat about my plans to come back to work (my boss is super nice and came to the house because I have a new baby and couldn't make it in to talk) and I guess when she stood up the dog ate the poop. She came running into the kitchen with her pants around her ankles screaming PUPPY ATE MY POOP over and over and then fell on her face. It was the funniest thing I've seen in weeks
90,"After having visited the city multiple times and reading your story, I'm under the impression that Paris is 30% romance and 70% straight ghetto."

94,"As a counter read up on the Toronto G20 riots. 

EDIT: Not to shit on my country. Especially now Im a pretty proud Canadian. I just hate the storybook image people have of our country. We're not as friendly as we're portrayed! We have problems! We're human beings! I think its healthy to admit when your country does something absolutely terrible."

99,"If I ever write a book, I'm gonna seek your advice on the title."
100,Could be worse. suction cup DILDO
101,"A general tip I've heard for escaping riots is to move away at a perpendicular angle as soon as possible. The crowd generally moves as a blob so it's unlikely it will spill out left or right as opposed to forward, especially if the left or right direction are smaller side streets. Go with the flow from the sidelines until you can break off at an angle -- resist the urge to run directly away, as that's likely just the same direction the riot is moving, which you won't outrun. 

Of course, I imagine all this is much harder if you're getting teargassed and carrying an incapacitated girlfriend over your shoulder!"

Edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger!

105,"My husband had his nose broken and became crooked years ago. It causes chronic health problems for him and it will be thousands of dollars and intense surgery to fix it (and we are not guaranteed the surgery will be successful in fixing the problems). Please get your nose fixed now instead of later. It may just be cosmetic right now, but years from now it might cause you a lot more problems."
106,"...huh, TIL"
107,Why would you just start yelling that down the phone for that long without even waiting to hear a word from the other person? Got to say the perfect storm of coincidences in this makes me a bit sceptical.

114,"I'd say it makes him a *good* friend, as not doing it would make him a spectacularly bad friend. Saying that deed made him great is implying he'd still be a good friend if he had left you out to freeze."
115,"What the fuck would he call you over at midnight to have that conversation?

From your account, why did he feel the need to have that conversation at all?

At any rate, I'm sorry that happened to you, that must have hurt."
116,I had a deaf Uber driver the other day and the first thing he told me when he got in the car was that he was deaf. It woulda been really awkward if he would of said nothing. He talked the entire time but he was really nice.

132,"i really wonder about these kinds of tifu's. it sounds like you were actually being racist and trying to be funny and were called out by a guy with no sense of humor (and rightly so). and then you cooked up this story about how all that racist shit is just innocent pillow talk with your gf. idk, i mean it seems maybe plausible, but come on. pretty fucking coincidental. anyway if you are lying, you suck at lying. if you're telling the truth, then damn. your truth sucks.

On the upside they said London was amazing, cleaner than expected, they thought it would be a slum compared to Paris, but it saved their trip. I think my mother's heart was broken and rebuilt in the span of a few days. "
141,Or color your whole face red so it doesn't stand out
142,I regularly put the cheap shitty chocolate chip biscuits they supply at work into the microwave so the chocolate melts. One time I put some on a piece of paper towel as all the plates were dirty and put it in for 2 minutes by accident instead of the usual 20 seconds. I left the lunch room and when I came back the room was full of smoke and the microwave appeared to be on fire. I opened the door and tipped the microwave over the edge of the bench so that the biscuits and paper towel slid out into the bin below. At this point the bin caught fire as well. I dragged the bin outside but not before several co-workers came in to find out if the lunch room was on fire. My boss was not impressed. They still give me shit about it years later.

He taps on the window and is like ""haha come on dude"" and I roll down the window part-way and say ""uuh, you sure you got the right car?"" He does a double-take and is like ""Woah, I swore you were my friend. He's got this exact same car!""

I think maybe, now that I think of it, had I turned around once the tear gas cleared and made my way towards the police with her in my arms, maybe they would have realized what was happening and helped me.  it just never occurred to me, I didn't trust that the cops, in the chaos, would be able to realize that we were innocents caught up in it.

The friend we were waiting for always wears a baseball cap, so when we saw a guy in a baseball cap driving a white SUV pull up to the curb, we walked over and got in the car. Once in the car, we looked up and saw a guy we'd never seen before looking at us like he'd seen a ghost. We quickly apologized and got out of the car. The guy driving, obviously spooked, drove off. Then finally after a few more minutes of waiting, our friend pulls up to the curb. We get in the back and I tell him about our mistake, ""You won't believe what just happened, man. We got in the car with some random guy!"" I look over at him, laughing, and quickly realize we just got in the car with THE SAME GUY we'd scared before! As it turns out he'd circled the block and pulled back up to the curb. Without saying anything we awkwardly got back out of the car just as our actual ride pulled up. We told him about what happened and had a good laugh."
200,Name totally checks out. ಠ_ಠ
201,"Just to let you know human poo to dogs is the holy grail of treats. No joke. While potty training my son if he had a number 2 in his pants I always knew from my dogs trailing behind him and snapping at one another over who would get to eat it. 
Many times I had to struggle to get the dogs to let go of his poo filled undies. 
People poo is like doggy Crack. "
202,If you tilt your head to the right your bruise kind of looks like Squidward 
203,"Sorry to hear that, are you and your girlfriend alright now ??"
204,"I'm African and was not bothered by the fact that OP mentioned the guy who punched him was African, he was simply describing his attacker. Why anyone would be bothered by this is beyond me. I'm more bothered that OP and his girlfriend had to go through that simply while trying to watch a football game."
205,"Morning and occasional evening routine.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Send help."
206,"""Guy is a rare living recipient of the Darwin Award after he caused his testicles to implode due to repeated exposure to extreme cold.   According to his best friend, they were always this size and the man just needs to accept his micropenis and learn to use his tongue."" "
207,Ah the joys of Paris. The buildings! The views! The constant sense of mounting tension in the air!
208,That is by far the most.. and only positive thing out of this. 
209,Sounds like you went to the..... DANGER ZONE
210,"The thing is, you probably don't realize it, but what you're doing is offensive. Sure, our 70 year old uncle gets away with this because no one tells them anything since they're days away from croaking anyways. 

But if you're younger than 70 and are doing 1950s type stereotypical racial voices and don't realize it's not an appropriate joke, then you're probably gonna have a lot more TIFU days.   "
211,"Light green definitely looks like it's gonna be your friend here. Find a theater friend with some ""mellow yellow"" "
212,"&gt; your fiancé 

Too soon, man. (Also, it's unclear which one you're referring to.)"
213,"As in behaviour by the authorities? or behaviour by the protesters? Because as a downtown person who got caught up in it while walking home, what the police did was absolutely appalling and a complete violation of our civil liberties (and this coming from a guy whose sympathies initially rested with the police, but almost getting trampled by horse cops at the official protest zone changes a man)"
214,"More like /u/reincarn8ed, /u/ElPresidenteCamacho  and /u/Tronck need to start a research group. That post links to another:

Clearly, this NeedsMoreTests."
215,"Yo at least try to find the dude, pay for for the ride and say...well...write sorry in person."
216,A little concealer should do the trick
217,You say underage in your tl;dr like it would be okay if she were of age.
218,"*Just a spoonful-o-feces, makes the kimchee go dooown...*"
219,"&gt; Lil miss pussy scrubber 

Thanks for this OP."
220,"""whoops, silly sis, how did you manage that! Geez. Tehe tehe"""
221,"Would it surprise you to know that [mustard is rich in vitamin A,C and K, and that it unclogs pores and is great for your skin?](http://www.totalbeauty.com/content/slideshows/homemade-face-mask-150422/page15)

You should've stuck two cucumber slices to her eyes and offered to trim her toenails."
222,"i know right!? i mean, if he had gotten that cellphone charged he could have demanded a considerable ransom money"
223,"I wish my girlfriend made me a racist everytime I had an interaction with her.

Or I wish she existed at all."
224,"Better than nothing I guess, I'd personally just say goodbye to my underwear but I guess we're all different."
225,What if the tornado walks through the door?
226,Also commit ritual suicide.
227,Uber tried to tell him that before the car even arrived.
228,Managed to hold in her laughter until my daughter fell and her tiny (not properly wiped) butt was up in the air
229,"I can't be the only snowflake thinking that, even if there's not a word of a lie in OP's story, he was still pretty racist, cos the whole comedy asian voice thing is really fucking racist. "
230,Give it a blanket and tell it to cover up.
231,You ARE allowed to mock anyone or anything you want. You're not allowed to demand that people think it's not shitty.
232,Dated a girl with a deaf mother for a long time. She did the same.
233,"&gt; ...been really awkward if he would of said nothing

IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID NOTHING. WOULD **HAVE**. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY... MY ANUS IS BLEEDING."
234,"Went pretty well for your friend.
Expected another ending of your story ... "
235,[deleted]
236,Absolutely agree here. It's safe and sweet tasting.
237,"Yes, for a reasonable $200 fee Delta will do anything."
238,AMA time?
239,"I had something similar happen during thanksgiving with my family one year. We had it at my sister's apartment (her bf at the time was a pretty big stoner).

There was food everywhere and I had a bunch of turkey and everything and went to the kitchen to put everything away - saw a plate of brownies.

Thinking some desert sounded great, I ate one.

It was so good, I almost grabbed a second, but decided against being a fatass.

About 30 minutes later I was talking to my sister when I stopped mid sentence and asked... ""uh... why do I feel high?""

Turns out those were pot brownies - I hadn't smoked in a year or so at that point so I spent the next few hours blazed as fuck slightly annoyed. The only time in my life I have just randomly been high."
240,The GF in his username stands for gigantic farts
241,*brushing intensifies*
242,"At least he was only 14, not much for u/penguincarnage to show which would explain the not so reaction."
243,Throw the couch out.... 
244,"Can verify.

Friends talked about it for years, blew it off.

Discovered the candyland of reddit a couple months back, now part of my morning and occasional evening routine."
245,Good thing for that chef to find out early enough that his former prospective employee makes asinine racist jokes to his gf.  Sounds like he dodged a bullet there.  
246,yes we are great! thank you for your concern
247,....that should win an award of some kind
248,"Seems like everyone is forgetting the tornado. If there's a tornado, no matter what walks through the door I would understand and welcome it. "
249,Is the pizza ever not okay?
250,"I have no idea where you're flying from. But I'm in Chicago, so I just did a quick search for red-eye flights this morning (18th) from ORD-SLC. Unfortunately, it does indeed look like it's gonna be about four figures.

Hopefully, the bf will realize it's an honest mistake and forgive you rather easily.

Have you thought about going to the airport anyway? Maybe there's a last-minute cancelation and the airline can do something to help? What if someone on the red-eye overslept and missed their flight? I honestly don't know the answer here so please don't take my words as some sort of actual reliable/informed opinion. Just spit balling."
251,There's only one way to make it right. Eat her vag juice.
252,Natural selection was so close ....
253,"Interviewer: *this guy fucks, better hire him*"
254,First thing that popped in my mind also!
255,That is totally the TIFU I expected. 
256,"There's something for everybody on here. I love it.  

*unzips*"
257,Or got slapped with a dick. Either or.
258,"They wouldn't have helped you unfortunately. During riots, the police rarely help civilians, even tourists. And I'm not saying that to say the police sucks or anything, it's just what happens. If you treat an injury they beat you up. If you're moving across the street, they beat you up. It's what they're told to do."
