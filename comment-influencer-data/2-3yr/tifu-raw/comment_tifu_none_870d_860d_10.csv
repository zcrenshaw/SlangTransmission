0,"Go to urologist now.

http://www.healthline.com/health/urethral-stricture

No joke, not knowing about this issue nearly killed me twice.  any damage to penis can cause them, treatment is just steroid shot, if they get inflamed your urine flow gets cut off and if not treated immediately with a catheter, your bladder can rupture, this kills the crab."
1,"Seriously though. And if you're embarrassed, you can just say you tripped and fell, dick first into the opening of that bottle."
2,Sounds like you got bamboozled
3,"""Hey, you two potential witnesses, move along!"""
4,Instructions unclear dick stuck in bottle.
5,"Why the fuck isn't this higher? At LEAST call your damn doctor.

Edit: thankfully this is now at the top."
6,I was expecting something worse like your magnet flying into a teacher/student's pacemaker or something
7,"Classic scam.    Find injured bird, get some sucker to stop and help, rob the guy while he's running after the bird.  "
8,"""Your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot""

Sounds like somebody just played themselves"
9,"Million to one shot, doc."
10,"yeah dude, girlfriend's judgement is questionable at best here"
11,"Dude, you can't just go and tell people about 4chan. You should've at least show her what you were browsing."
12,"this reminds me of getting pulled over. I had made loads of home movies with blood and had a white shirt soaked in blood and took it off and threw it on the dash. Cop asks why I am covered in blood. Tell him, ""Oh, it's fake"". He goes back to cruiser for a while. Comes back with a speeding ticket and never mentions it. Now I'm not detective but I would have asked a few more questions."
13,"They knew about the queue, fucking pricks acting like they couldn't see the damn thing. I would've given those kids the evil eye.  Hell even just a regular eye."
14,"I went to the urologist and he told me that I had to stop masturbating. When I asked him why, he said, ""Because I'm trying to fucking examine you!"""
15,"She probably went on 4chan.com instead of 4chan.org

Edit: Fuck Sake guys. I don't want this much attention."
16,Your girlfriend sounds kind of mean tbh... What other outcome besides your dick getting hurt was she expecting when she stuffed it into a non-yielding plastic object and then made you hard?
17,[removed]
18,"A least you didn't yell , ""Oy, what are you lot looking at?""  It could have been worse."
19,You should probably go get that checked by a doctor
20,Break into her house again and leave apology notes everywhere
21,"Funny story... As a dentist I can assure you that no amount of denture adhesive would've fastened your teeth permanently closed. Your jaw muscles are powerful and your saliva prevents a strong bond from occurring. I'm sure it wasn't a fun mess to clean up, though. Thanks for sharing your experience with us"
22,Could have happened to anyone.
23,"OP's GIRLFRIEND IF YOU'RE READING THIS:

WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU TO STOP (whether they're begging or not) YOU FUCKING STOP."
24,"&gt;
Edit: So my girlfriend saw the post and says she's embarrassed and wants me to take it down.


&gt;If you come back here to check, no I'm not taking it down


Good on you. I think we've established that she has piss poor ideas."
25,"""I get off in 30 minutes. I don't need this shit right now."""
26,"Yeah, what the fuck. She didn't listen when she got asked to stop too."
27,"From someone who wore a steel cockring that caused permanent damage to my junk... go to the fucking doctor.  In my case I damaged my dorsal vein fucking around with stuff I didn't know much about.  Have fun being 20-something and needing pills to help get it up.

And learn how to use the word ""no"" or ""stop.""  Anyone who walks through a request like that, and doesn't stop, doesn't deserve to be with you.  Imagine if she said **stop** and you didn't?"
28,One of my younger female clients was asking me about torrenting so I showed her the Piratebay. I didn't consider that she didn't have an adblocker installed yet. The ads were all porn. One girl deepthroating and another one squirting. It was pretty egregious shit. Luckily she was cool and we both had a good laugh over it. 
29,i can't even feel my dick cause i'm paralyzed from the waist down but damn... i felt pain just reading this
30,No I think  you did it right.
31,"Grandpa looking at watch - ""Says here that you masturbated for three miles."""
32,"I was going to say his girlfriend is fucking stupid for that, but I like the way you worded that. 

Not only is her judgement terrible, so is OP's. If your girlfriend asked your to put your dick in a cigar cutter, would you do it? 

Edit: If I was to give OP some advice I would say use condoms. If you're going to procreate, at least one of you needs to have good judgement. You don't wanna have some kid stickin his dick in outlets to see what happens. "
33,"You'll be glad to hear that I am fat and plump now, but thanks for saving me ;)"
34,This is where public phones were the best option - you make a call from it to 911 to let them know that the blood spill is actually an accidental stage prop. Wipe the handset and walk away (hopefully there aren't any cameras to pull footage from).
35,"I wish I could sit in on that conversation where you explain copypasta to a group of uptight administrators. 

""Start from the beginning and tell us again about this... spaghetti xerox..."" 

edit: 

""...I see. Well, I hope this talk will make you think twice about engaging in ""the memes"" from now on. Now don't let us catch you plagiarizing any noodles in the future. You're free to go, Mister... Freer... Sorry, what was your name again?"" [;)](https://youtu.be/rQkCH_C-7AM)   "
36,"Hey, OP. Let us know what happens at 8. Like whether or not you still have a GF."
37,They got me
38,And a valuable lesson was hopefully learned that day about privacy and personal space.
39,"But that would require her targets to have been as careless as I was, unless I just made her job super easy by just dropping it. I don't know man. I just hope the local PD get a lead on this thing. I really needed that cash. "
40,"Shit, just getting fingers caught could be bad enough.  My fingers have had run-ins with numerous HDD magnets (try separating 2 of those)."
41,Can you imagine the outrage if it was the other way around?
42,"Honestly, probably the best thing you could have done considering the circumstances.  You lost only cash, your clothes, and some dignity.  Could have been worse and lost your wallet, phone, and other various valuables.

In the future, if a girl is willing to go to a sleazy hotel to hook up, chances are they're a prostitute or they're going to steal your stuff."
43,"My bad, man. I'm just quite stressed about this at the moment and can't really tell anymore. Gotta tell my wife about this too. Fuck, she ain't gonna be happy about it one bit!"
44,"Q: ""What's the difference between 4chan.com and 4chan.org?""

A: ""One is full of depraved, obscene filth. The other is a porn site."""
45,"Watch out buddy. You blocked out a bunch of identifying information in that first picture but the names of the vice principals are still there, the state is easy to see, and it's making it all too easy for some asshats to start doxxing. "
46,Holy shit this has to be the answer lol
47,"I'm 72 y.o.  When I was in high school all the cool kids used to come to school with a magnet tied to their belts, as was the fashion at the time.  We couldn't get rare earth magnets because of the war, only the usual hardware store kind."
48,"""I begged her to stop"""
49,Yes
50,"""Oy, what are you, blind?"" "
51,I once sent that same copy pasta to a friend of mine thinking he knew what it was and would understand the joke. He told his parents and I had to talk to them about how it was a joke and I didn't really want to kill their son in 700 different ways with just my bare hands. Some people just don't understand blatant overexaggeration.
52,[deleted]
53,I would highly avoid showing torrent to anyone without proper knowledge because 95% they fuck it up anyways and then it was YOU who showed them the illegal site that's full of viruses.
54,"That was a joke, btw.  "
55,"Bloody piss poor ideas, actually."
56,He really didn't want to do any paperwork 
57,"Half way through I was expecting ""then the dick pic sent to my aunt"""
58,"&gt;We can see your IP and notice it belongs to [insert college name]. We will now forward this onto your college administration.

...what the fuck did you say to me, you little bitch?"
59,"Man, I love. Sentence fragments. "
60,"Female here.
To your girlfriend:
You are awful.  What did you expect to happen?  Did you expect it to get tight just enough so that it would get stuck, so he can dance around with it?  Are you stupid?
Can you even try to fathom how that felt, how it still feels?
Also:  STOP MEANS STOP.  STOP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
You are a cruel being, and I hope you stay embarrassed so you can learn from this.  I'd also suggest you read allllll of the replies on here so that you won't do this again."
61,"Isn't that exactly what the killer would do, in order to slow down the investigation?"
62,Halfway I was expecting a threesome including friend's mom. Guess too much of porn I have seen. 
63,You and I apparently have different ways of making new friends 
64,I can't tell which one of you is more dumb
65,"I know OP probably has this shit set to go to his inbox, but just in case. /u/3yronF1ve go to the dick doctor pronto!

Edit: Read the parent comment!!"
66,"&gt;You should probably go get that checked by a doctor 

Yeah I definitely would. "
67,"""If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue""

Good luck."
68,Magneto's origin story
69,I know. I'm just saying there would be outrage if a man wouldn't stop fondling a woman when asked to. 
70,Lol harsh but it made me laugh! One ticket to hell confirmed 
71,"Ha, your ""thanks for sharing your experience with us"" line made me think I was on some dental form. I definitely scrolled to the top to check where I was lolol "
72,You have to pay your magnets to separate? Britain seems like a strange place.
73,"BITCH.

Sorry I had to say it."
74,The lack of any kind of conclusion really makes me think it's made up. He didn't just ride off naked into the sunset to never be seen again. 
75,I can't upvote this enough
76,"Fuckin magnets, how do they work?"
77,It would help us understand if you could show us exactly how your joke was worded. If it's as ambiguous as you imply then it seems dubious that they'd proceed with charges.
78,"""what's 4chan?""

""it's where most of the fucked up stuff on the internet happens"" or ""it's like a really fucked up reddit"""
79,If there's a hell then I'll see you there mate. Can't say the same for the blind kids. They won't be seeing anybody. 
80,"This is so me... I used to be very athletic when I was younger, I could throw down a slam dunk and was both quite fast and had a pretty decent upper body strength. Problem is that when I drink I forget I'm not an 18 yo active basketball player anymore. My friends know this and like to make bets when we're drunk and it always end up with me faceplanting or almost drowning while trying to jump over a river or something."
81,"""Let's play a game!""

""What's it called?""

""Sexual Battery."""
82,"Tell her about the pigeon scam, maybe that will lighten her mood

83,"This is suspiciously close to something a friend of mine did. Same time frame as well.

Rich, is that you?"
84,"She browses 9gag, it was for the best man."
85,Wtf? This is pathetic. I feel so sorry for you. 
86,"Man, I understand this is tifu, but shit. The amount of tifu's about getting in trouble for school shooter memes and jokes should have tipped you off :/ still sucks though"
87,"I remember my high school biology teacher telling a story about a student who's housekeeper found a ""human heart"" in the refrigerator of the students house. Apparently it made the news, etc.. Well, when the camera panned to the ""human heart"" he immediately recognized it as a pig heart they had dissected in class. I wish I could remember more details but I can't imagine the police were very pleased."
88,More concerned whether or not he still has a dick tbh
89,"It's their fault for not letting you talk. You're a witness in the area. I would've talked to you if you approached me. I would assume you knew something about what was going on, and if you weren't afraid, that would make me more interested. If cops weren't so impersonal these days, things like this wouldn't happen. "
90,Whew that's a relief i thought all the blood meant i was doing something wrong.
91,"If she dumps him because he told a story of her sexually assaulting him to a group of internet strangers, then she's a fucking asshole. On top of being a sexual predator."
92," I'm so sorry, I just picture you standing there paralyzed by indecision like a squirrel in the road! Totally something I would do. "
93,"That sucks. But it could have been worst, thinking about a splintered bamboo through a thigh/femoral artery literally just gave me chills. "
94,"""Honest, doc, I tripped and fell into a collapsing table!"""
95,"I just did... At work... Let's hope no one checks my internet history... 
On second thought that would make for a good /r/TIFU post."
96,"Piggybacking onto the medical advice post here to add some more:

In case anyone else ever considers anything like this: Constricting the flow of blood to the penis and getting an erection is **incredibly dangerous!** OP is very lucky he didn't get his penis suck - because if he did, he'd have to go to the hospital to have it drained. They do this with a large bore needle directly into your penis.

Depending on how long you wait until seeking medical attention, you may end up with penile gangrene or they may have to **amputate your penis.**

This is why you hear warnings on drug commercials for ""if you experience an erection lasting more than 4 hours seek medical attention."" Also the same reason that cock rings are often made of a flexible material or may include safety release mechanisms.

Edit: In case you're wondering what I mean by a ""large bore needle"" - here's a NSFL image of someone undergoing a Winter Shunt after a 29 hour erection: [NSFL - click at your own risk](http://i.imgur.com/QWda4eJ.jpg) - and here's an animated version of that same procedure in case you're afraid of clicking: http://i.imgur.com/Fh9Yblp.jpg"
97,Upvote for the edit. 
98,"My ex did this. Him and his then girlfriend went to a gig and had a fight. Some bloke was just staring at her. Kept looking. In a total piss my ex shouted at him ""Stop staring at her you creep!"" He replied ""if only I could..."""
99,"&gt; Men, op certainly is having a rough month

Are you addressing a WWII battalion?"
100,"You'd think after ""gorilla warfare"" they'd realize that you're either a troll or at the very least not a Navy SEAL. "
101,"The fact that it made her cry sounds like she's just stupid and thought it'd just be an inconvenient prank.  A lot of girls don't seem to realize that penises are woundable.

My girlfriend often will try to, instead of moving her own body, bend my penis to her.  Once she bent it down far enough (and rapidly enough) that it ""popped"", making an audible noise, and hurt for a couple of days.  I think I *might* take a break from the relationship, or sex at least, if it ever happens again.  It'd be one thing if it was a one time occurrence, but I've told her time and time again not to bend my penis left, right, or down more than about 45 degrees but she continues to do it sometimes (although it hasn't been bad enough for the aforementioned popping to happen).  

It's infuriating to me.  Imagine if I routinely just twisted her arm out of socket due to lack of consideration.  How hard is it to learn to be gentle?  You don't even have to be super gentle, just don't bend it.  It goes upwards.  I don't think she realizes how big a deal it is, but if that ever happens again I swear to god I'm masturbating instead of sleeping with her for at least a month or two.

Just typing this out pisses me off.

edit: Not sure why so many of you seem to assume we've never talked about it.  Hasn't really happened in a while.  Who knew reddit's powers of armchair analysis would once again prove to be impotent?"

106,"""Uh guys, yeah there's this hacker known as 4chan whos been using the same paragraph for years."" "
107,Any traffic lights nearby? You could call your local PD and tell them you believe someone stole your wallet when you stopped to help the injured bird. Usually traffic light cameras will only be checked if there's an accident but perhaps if a theft that large occurred they may be willing to help. It's worth a shot.
108,Can you imagine the trouble the officer would be in if it turned out he *was* a killer?
109,"You mean the one that stuck his dick in a bottle, or the one that told his girlfriend what his reddit username was?"

112,Mods are ruining reddit. 
113,"For those having trouble finding the words to describe memes to others, here's how to explain a meme:

&gt; A meme (as far as the current internet culture is concerned) refers to almost any inside joke amongst a given online community. What makes a meme a meme rather than an inside joke is that the joke goes well beyond one's immediate circle of friends.

&gt; The Navy Seals copypasta has remained so well known in so many different communities for so many years that it's considered a classic by now. It appeals to a satirical sense of humor, poking fun at those who use the relative anonymity of an online interaction to put on a tough-guy facade. It has most likely never been meant seriously and rarely, if ever, is used as a cruel prank; in almost all cases, it's meant in mutually understood jest. The person in question probably (naively) assumed that anyone reviewing the chat in question would be familiar with this particular meme.

&gt; The site KnowYourMeme.com features an encyclopedia of sorts of most internet memes, which brief explains the origin and usage of any given meme, often also featuring external links to various in-context examples. Here is the entry on the Navy Seals Copypasta if you want to know more. (Insert link here but I'm on mobile and getting lazy.)"
114,Ouch! That's a big loss for a small mistake! Hope it doesn't have too big an impact on your business
115,"OP is my friend and I thought he was being pissy and not texting me for three weeks. He replied to a Reddit comment I left for him and told me he didn't have his phone and had been in the hospital for 19 days. Turns out I was in the same hospital with my father the whole time. I walked up one flight of stairs and there he was. 

Edit: now he is pissy because he thinks I'm getting karma from him. 😂 good to know his brain still works the same. "

163,"I once superglued one eye shut.

Was up late working on a report for the office, and by about 2 AM my eyes were itching and dry. Former live in girlfriend wore contacts occasionally and had drops. I grabbed them from the drawer and, in front of the bathroom mirror, titled my head back and dropped a couple in one eye. Thankfully it burned terribly almost immediately because it prevented me from repeating it in my other eye. Doused my eye with water from the sink but I was too late. Lid was stuck shut.

I walked to the nearest emergency room, about 1.5 - 2 km away and was greeted by a laughing nurse, followed by a very amused ER doctor. I was told they couldn't do anything about it since their ophthalmologist had gone home for the night and sent me to a clinic the following morning. 

The specialist told me I would have to wait two weeks until the glue broke down, then added that she could probably cut the glue between the lids since there was a small opening on one side. A couple drops of freezing and a minute of terror staring at scissors nearly against my eyeball and my eye popped open. Spent a while without eyelashes...

For those wondering, the dropper was eye-dentical to saline eye drops without a label. No lasting effects, thankfully."

Imagine this was a post by a woman who got a steel rod shoved up her urethra or something. Saying this would be outrageous. "
171,"We'll live... Overall our numbers are going up, so I don't doubt we'll make up for the loss.

But the clients we missed are well and truly gone, so whatever we make by the end of the year will always be 5000$ less than we could have had. 

I'm just glad it was easily rectified. "
172,"The first part of any kink (think if it as kink 101 class) is learning boundaries, negotiation, consent and safe words.

No one casually sticks their dick into a water bottle too small for their erect penis.  That's a fetish/kink thing.  Some people like pain.

But every single aspect is discussed (negotiated) before the ""scene"" (the act of what you are about to do).  There's a universal safe word ""red"" that means stop whatever it is you're doing and check with each other to see what's up.

Asking someone to stop is 100% respected and should be followed, unless it's negotiated beforehand to be ""consequentially non-concentual."" - aka a rape/abuse/rough scene, in which another safe word is chosen.

So her convincing him to stick his dick in a bottle and then not stopping if he showed signs of duress or pain, or asking her to stop, and she didn't?  That's 100% on her, IMO.  Regardless of how stupid it is to fuck with your urethra."
