edit: Apparently browsing ""new"" still yields you that pesky reddit karma, after all :x)"
1,"So you smoked some dank shit. Nice!  

Edit: my most upvoted comment is about smoking cat turds. Nice! "
2,This is the story we all hope for when wading through the neverending garbage pile of TIFUs where someone shat themselves or made an awkward comment to a girl and assumed the world would shatter.
3,"Honest mistake, but Jesus how crazy do you have to be that instead of ASKING you go about it to just try and snatch it, and then assaulting a tsa agent. People man

Edit: spelling. Yay phones "
4,I think this is my favorite TIFU of all time. So one-of-a-kind. I'd take this over twenty caught-masturbating stories any day.
5,I love when I get a slag over my tip
6,"ALWAYS attach resumes as PDF, much easier to work with for the recipient, and more professional"
7,"I'm no longer wondering why OP isn't allowed to smoke weed in the house. 

edit: this isn't an anti-weed statement at all. Just a joke. Ups to OP for editing to acknowledge the turmoil. I'm not anti-weed, pretty far from it. "
8,"""I wont be dealing with your shit, Lieutenant. You'll be dealing with mine."""
9,That money will probably make somebody's day
10,Not taking the chance to talk to Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler is the true fuck up

12,"As a wastewater treatment operator I cringed at this whole story. It would've been so simple to say ""I don't know how to do that"". And where the hell is your operators license? 

Edit: I've noticed a lot of people asking how to get into the wastewater/water treatment field so I figured I'd let you know how. First you don't need a college degree, with most of the plants I've encountered. I've found it's easier to just go on google and type in ""Wastewater/Water Treatment Operator Certification programs in [your city here]."" The classes are usually Monday - Friday from 8-4. For wastewater, tests are usually a month after the class. I've heard water is usually the week directly after classes end. (Anyone correct me if I'm wrong). Also you can call your local wastewater/water facility and talk to the Superintendent/Chief Operator and ask him/her what steps you'd need to take to become an operator. Hope this helps! "
13,"As a fabricator,  I know what you're talking about.  
Wait until you get Slag all over the tip. It'll sound like a machine gun.

15,I drank some rotten soy milk last summer ... It was so disgusting that I puked about 3 times. There was a piece of mold in my mouth. Never forget. :'(
16,"When you try to spank the monkey, but your ass unleashed the funky

17,OP is the worst designated driver ever. 
18,"Haha good find! Looks like ""Stephen Felt"" has been taking credit for my work as man on escalator"
19,Thank fuck that officer saw it all instead of being told you were trying to steal it or something
20,"Yup, out of the 150 union employees sitting around doing nothing, one should have been working."
21,I would say this is not a fuck up but a win. You just proved to your instructor that not only can you deal with something going wrong at a critical point in your flight but that you can also recover from the incident safely.
22,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038919/combined

I believe its this movie, theres even an uncredited actor in the role of man on escalator... OP?"
23,That money will probably buy somebody 20$ worth of weed some day
24,Right when my flesh started being shredded by a steel blade
25,"A man can only have so many ways of saying ""I went to jack off in the bathroom""

&gt; Bop my Bologna 

&gt; Do the deed"
26,"Yeah, I was mortified, honestly. I mean, I can understand being upset, but don't do something stupid..."
27,Sounds like they didn't really deserve your kindness but hey at least you get some good karma!
28,"*Looks at cracked screen realizing you fucked up*

""They don't crack, they fucking shatter.."""
29,"The position you are talking about is an operator. Each state tests operators and certifies them to operate water treatment.

If you are not aware of the situation there should be an operator in charge and responsible for the plant. 

Losing the job isnt even the bad possibility... Water treatment plants workers that lie about their qualifications and or falsify reports can go to jail."
30,Story of my life.
31,Tifu by having sex yeah that's right I HAD SEX! 
32,"About 5 years ago I bought a Grateful Dead album at a flea market and when I got home I realized there was over 60 bucks stashed inside the sleeve.  All of the bills pre-dated 1976.  I immediatly went out and spent it all on bud, I figured it's what that original Deadhead owner would have wanted. "
33,"Do you have a smartphone? If so, it has a little piece of silicon and germanium on the back covered in a phosphor. When you touch your phone the right way, current flows through it and large numbers of photons are shot out of your phone. These can be directed at objects, whereupon they will reflect off of the objects.

This is where it gets tricky. On the front of your head, there are two fleshy, fluid-filled orbs that allow photons to enter your head. You have to put those in a spot where photons are being relfected. Upon doing this, you will find you are able to gather information from your surroundings based on the nature of the photons hitting your face orbs. You can use this information to identify objects in front of you. Try it out, it's pretty cool!

Edit: Holy shit 1400 points? This was barely even relevant!"
34,So....anyone know which movie/tv series/commerical? has both Aniston and Butler in it that had a scene of them on an escalator in a casino?
35,"From the title, I had inferred that someone was going to be giving birth to a miscarried baby or something. I'm definitely glad that wasn't the case. "
36,Some subs are like panning for gold. You have to stay subscribed for that one small nugget of gold. 
37,"Easy solution.
Leave a blank page at that link and then send each an individual e-mail stating you sent them a college project by mistake.
Then send them an attachment of the new one.

Furthermore, you can go into the drive share settings for that file and just kick out the first 8 in order to be able to just keep the ninth if you are savvy and don't want to leave  a blank page.
Good luck mate!"
38,God damn I wish you hadn't interrupted them and we could have all watched a scene between Butler and Anniston take place with an extremely confused 'extra' wandering around in the background just trying to escape.
39,Holy shit that's what that is? I thought I might've gotten some metal shavings in my eye.

45,"Yep.  The same thing happen to me when they were shooting We Are Marshall on campus at Marshall University.  I was leaving Jenkins Hall and walked right into a shot with Matthew McConaughey.  Not my problem.  They couldn't lock the doors because of fire safety, but they could've at least posted a sign.  That movie was a great excuse if you were late for class because they constantly had streets and sidewalks blocked."
46,Somehow yes! Its absolutely fine. Thank god for samsung water resistance I guess xD
47,"That sucks! One time, a couple years ago back when I had my Droid R2-D2, I was out at the pub. After I had a couple rounds I started thinking that the glass on the front of my phone must be plastic because I had had the phone for almost 2 years and I had not cracked the screen. I had dropped it and done all kinds of awful things to that phone but it was just fine throughout everything. I was absolutely certain that the front was not glass, it was some sort of strong protective substance. I decided it would be best to bite the phone, for some sort of conclusive testing, you know? I bit the phone, smashed the screen and wound up with a mouthful of glass. I'm pretty sure to this day this is one of my most shameful moments. 

"
48,I find your commitment to your joke deeply hilarious and encourage you to see how far you can take this.
49,Maybe next time just stick something up your butt 
50,"""Slag"" is British for ""easy girl""."

53,Ha ha ouch! I think every person who's done welding will tell you they've done that a time or two. Not exactly a pleasant experience! 
54,"I'm impressed you were able to find these clips lol.. not me, but I bet they put that guy in the jacket behind them as a buffer after I screwed it up"
55,Or maybe the director thought the frame looked better with someone in the background... Maybe you did art op! 
56,"I suppose it is too soon to tell, but did your phone make it out alive? "
57,"Butler is a bro, even if all but one of his accents is pish."
58,Well thankfully you're not black. That'd have been an awkward sale. 
59,At what moment precisely did you realize that you fucked up?
60,He probably has a small case of arc eye. Basically feels like sand in your eyes until they recover.
61,"Five years ago I bought some $5 jeans at  a Goodwill. They had a $10 bill in the tiny pocket.

 It made my day because I was on food stamps, just had my car rear-ended and totaled, Husband's back injury kept him from work, slipping into debt... And my only pair of non work pants had a hole in the butt. I needed a pair of jeans. They fit me in the dressing room. I got them home and went through the pockets before laundry, like you do... I really needed that smile.

Things are better. Finally have full time work, my insurance now covers treatment for my husband's herniated discs, I have a replacement used car, and my debt is almost gone. Now I donate my spare things to Goodwill. But I always triple check the pockets."
62,"Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/qWfixQEIlb0) of them shooting on the escalator, but it's probably the next take after the fuck up.

Edit: [Another](https://youtu.be/cn3AB1X2OZg)

74,I would press assault charges. They should learn that that kind of behavior is not okay. The only way they will learn is if they pay for it. I would consider a lawsuit only if you can afford it.

78,"Good luck peeling it off, BUT it can serve as lifetime protection"
79,"I am so paranoid about having my laptop stolen every single time I go through security for this very reason.  The few seconds you lose sight of your stuff is more than enough time for someone to walk off with the laptop, and from your story, TSA is clearly not monitoring whose stuff gets taken by whom.  I hate the current security system so much.  "
80,"Yup. Been there done that. Your eyes will likely be fine, but like someone else said, it they keep hurting more than a day then go see (hehe) an eye doctor."
81,How's the tinnitus? 
82,"Yes.  If it's getting worse more than 24 hours after it happened, see a doctor.  Otherwise it will heal OK.  A lot of welders acquire anaesthetic eyedrops to relieve it - this isn't a great idea as if the pain is severe it should be treated.  "
83,"Yeah, not everything can be replaced. I travel with some very expensive camera equipment and at the end of the trip, those memory cards cannot be replaced. Everyone thinks it's just ""stuff"" until it's their stuff, and then it's tragic.

That said, getting arrested doesn't really help the situation. And assaulting TSA, while great for an emotional release, just gives them more leverage over you, and no one wants that.

I always go through last in my party, and make sure that someone else in my party is on the other side to receive, in case I get hung up or whatever. Also, I have no faith in humanity, so I literally stare at my camera bag the entire time. So far, so good."
84,[removed]
85,"Did you end up trying the actual non-rotten soy milk? I can imagine it would go one of two ways, either soy milk has been forever tainted for you or trying fresh soy milk makes you appreciate that it's not rotten and thus like it? I'm super curious."
86,"Bro, you're probably going to get *Toxoplasmosis*! **BUCKLE UP BUCKAROO!**"

103,"Yeah, this is potato level commitment. "
104,I feel like the person who put the ad in the paper for OP was probably a clansman and had no idea that a Kia is a type of car.
105,I think so because I held it up to her she did a double take at her hip then her face went from surprised to hate and she opened up lol. My boss asked me a few hours ago about pressing charges. I really want to get the man to pay my dry cleaning cause my slacks got all dicked because he was wearing boots like Docs or Tims.
106,"I don't know exactly what the regs are in NY/NJ where I work. Operating a plant like this is not the type of work I usually perform. I believe the OSHA 40hr hazwoper cert is sufficient though.

If not, do you have any idea if my employer would take responsibility for not letting me know I lack proper certification?"
107,"It's OPs fault for not just saying ""I don't know how to that, they never taught me,"" or anything along those lines. I doubt the people he asked knew he was never shown."
108,The craziest part is they charged you $11.83/gig. 
109,"When I was 12  I moved to Houston from rural Pennsylvania .  One of my first friends had property in Louisiana, and invited me to go duck hunting with his family one winter. We make the trip to W. Louisiana and things got a little strange. My friend had a small cabin that needed some work and his dad had some one doing repairs while we were there. The worker was a proud mullet wearing white guy with a huge sons of the confederacy sticker on his van. Me being a dumb yankee asked him what that meant. His response was to show us what his club was all about. With an ok from friends dad we all jumped in his van and went on a cruise to the club hangout. The club house was a large compound with 12 ft white fence surrounding a giant white barn with a large confederate flag on top. I instantly realized I fucked up and made up a story about being sick and needing to go back. I had never seen anything like that and I thought the rednecks from PA were bad. I have not gone back to Louisiana, my friend is now a youth minister so I guess the racist gene skipped a generation. 

TLDR: Ignorant yankee learned that KKK meeting houses are a real thing."

133,"The problem was too much acetylene... waaaayyy too much. I've had a few bangs but none that loud...

Also, turn the acetylene off before the oxygen when you're done, trust me."

UPDATE: I tried. I couldn't do it. I waited until I had to take a shit and then got my phone out in the bathroom and started looking at porn. As I was getting hard I felt like I had to shit less and less. I waited until I was suitably aroused and then started forcing it out, but as soon as the smell hit I completely lost my hardon.

139,"Might be a little late in the game here, but essential oils are hydrophobic.  Meaning wherever there's water, they go the opposite way.  So if you try to rinse them off your skin, they will go deeper into your skin (and away from the water).  If you're still feeling the burn, try putting (thick) oil - such as coconut oil, olive oil, etc. -all over your body to draw the remaining essential oils in your skin out.  

Source: Took workshop on various essential oils from someone that's made essential oil from scratch as her own business for 20 years. Seems like it's a common lesson that people have to learn (that you can't just rinse out essential oils) so she emphasized this point.


EDIT: Clarifying to use thicker oil to draw the essential oils out. Added Source."

172,"I'm a water plant operator, have been for ten years. If you honesty believe getting a little pre filter water on you will give you bone cancer then you really don't know what you are doing and shouldn't have left you alone.

193,"Found a $100 bill in a wallet in a thrift store a while back.  I turned it in and by chance they actually knew who had donated the wallet and returned the money to them.  The place gave me the wallet for free and later I talked with the guy that got his money back.  Small city, small store."
194,"If only there was a geek there, then they could have picked the lock on your car door... Alas, all nerds."
195,I have no knowledge at all about water treatment and the whole post sounds like huge don't to me.
196,"Lol, sets are typically 12-14 hour days. You're basically  guaranteed OT, so there's a distinct incentive to get things over with early. Nobody wants to hit hour 16. Producers on the other hand will work a day to its max capacity to shorten the total number of days on a set. Locations,  security,  equipment rentals, catering all add up quick. The more scenes you knock out in the day, the leaner your budget is. Fun to call people lazy,  though! "
197,Like Forrest gimp 
198,If I can get my hands on it I will definitely put it up here
199,"At that point he should have just straight up Seinfeld it and said excuse me while awkardly trying to squeeze through them. Get to the bottom, give them a thumbs up and continue his way out. "
200,Potato? Never heard of that before. Sounds pretty good.
201,At least you didn't leave your wallet in one of them or something.  It could have been a lot worse.
202,They were split? They cracked up? 
203,"Also, a song whose message is ""I love you so much I would die for you, but you don't love me back"" is not a great choice for a wedding..."
204,We did it reddit!
205,"Its not that they don't care, it's that there are so many people on those sets and no one knows everyone.  Not choosing a specific job and instead saying you're an intern is pretty smart actually.  There's not many people on set who would question something like that."
206,"Wouldn't be surprised , they are extremely fast with school calls. At least where I'm from"
207,I once walked on to a Keanu Reeves movie set and just told them I was an intern. Everyone around didn't say anything and let me be. They don't care as long as you keep your mouth shut when the camera rolls.
208,"Just so you know, Open Office is no longer supported. You should use Libre Office"
209,Her reaction is hers entirely.
210,Some say he's still cleaning up the mess
211,Make a complaint to the carrier that they didn't explicitly state what the costs were when you entered the country. You should have received a text or some form of notification of cost for roaming when you first turned the phone on in the new country. At this point contacting a lawyer may be a good idea for advice if they did not inform you like this in some way.
212,Because he didn't know they were filming it and just wanted to move through them but these 2 jerks wouldn't move?
213,Exactly how many of you found $5 on the floor? What is strange is that you think it is part of the soup story.
214,"Seriously, I have never heard of attaching a link instead of a file, and I would never attach a file that was not a PDF.  I get annoyed when people send me Word docs as finished files at work.  

With a PDF, not only will it be more difficult for the recipient to lose or insert random words, it also gives you solid version control.  I can look back at every cover letter and resume I ever wrote because I have them all saved as PDFs.  It also REALLY helps the people hiring you when they can 1. just print off your docs, 2. save your file(s), and 3. see what they hell they are about to open by the file name.  With links, you are forcing them to take an extra 30 seconds to save your file for future use, which is about 20 more seconds than they want to spend even looking at your info.

Edit:  Thank you, /u/dracarys317, for the gold!!  Cheers to those of us who think that the greatest FU in this post is not making a PDF! "
215,TIL. So cinnamon sticks are dried rolled pieces of bark?
216,"That right there was what I immediately thought, because holy shit if she'd had the TSA and the police working for her, I'd have been boned. As I ran it back up to her, I was terrified of some Seinfeld-type stuff happening. If nothing else I've definitely learned to take less with me if I'm flying. "
217,Why would Klansmen buy a car made by foreign devils?
218,Me too thanks
219,Why didn't you play along? You could pretend to be one of the crowd and even make it to the movie's final cut. You missed a big chance
220,LEEEROY JENKIIINS
221,"Seconded, go to the doctor, get it all documented, and try for Assault/Battery charges.  There's only one way these kinds of people learn."
222,"When you go to beat your meat,

223,"could have been worse, could have tore your gooch."
224,"Well, he did say he *volunteered* and didn't let them know he didn't know how to do this stuff."

226,Hmmm something about their actions seems hypocritical. Yeah you may have went a little to far but they shouldn't force you to say out loud if you believe or not. This only alienates the students that don't. Expulsion will probably be the best thing to happen to you. Go to a normal school and bullied for how you look and not your religious beliefs like everyone else :)
227,Is your name Homer Simpson?
228,Yeah they're finwrq
229,I hope everything **turns** out **right**!
230,"Could you ask for a copy of the clip on your way out, pls?"
231,"Travel and send your folks postcards.

It will drive your dad fucking mental and give your mother some comfort that you are still alive and moving forward."
232,"Guess you could call that... a prime fuck up.

233,"I don't think naming your wifi something controversial or inappropriate is probable cause... where do you live, OP? Country wise?"
234,"You mean, you bought vinyls off this guy who also gave you free weed along with them :P"

237,Favorite is the vanilla flavored one.
238,"This. Generally, a licensed operator has to sign off every day (more or less) on a plant. This is a bigger issue, sad to say, than someone losing their job. Probably some hefty fines from the state.  I've worked for tiny tiny jurisdictions and even they had contingency plans in place in case their operators quit or didn't show up (usually a neighboring jurisdiction's operator would come over to inspect/run the plant).

Edit: left out a couple words "
239,You too my friend!
240,"In case anyone was wondering, its a county heatmap of the 2016 election"
241,"Jokes on you, she wanted the free cavity search."
242,Honestly an hour seems like an awfully low amount of time to learn how to operate the amount of equipment he was made responsible for. It sounds like the company did not offer anywhere near the amount of training required to properly do the job. 
243,Nice
244,sounds like they were doing a secret agent transfer... you know drop duffel bag make a scene swap duffel bags... you just tried to give them the drugs/bombs back and they wanted no part of it
245,"Check whichever box applies.

⬜ White.

247,Fun fact: The Pacific Northwest (Oregon/ Washington) has a larger klan population than Louisiana 
248,"Haha agreed, my favorite part was

&gt;I just assumed this was what Louisiana was like.

Me too u/notnp, me too."
249,"If that's actually OP, this might be a rare example of actual movie footage of a TIFU..../u/m3ch3ngin33r did you ever get round to watching it by any chance?"
250,Was Aniston as hot as she is on screen?
251,"Having a wifi network named ""abortion clinic"" isn't probably cause..."
252,Username checks out

Would have."
254,"&gt; I did not do it for the first landing because it was so damm busy with planes in the sky and stuff happened to fast.

What the hell, is this a common thing for people in training?  Jeez there's a lot of planes here, fuck the checklist let's land this bitch!"
255,Got a slight coincidence for ya.  Only screen I've ever broken was an iPhone 4s with an r2d2 case.
256,"Exactly. The entire situation could've been avoided by checking for some type of certification. 

And I'm working on my Grade 3 Certification. Fairly young operator (23 yr old) but I still know the Do's and Dont's. 

"
257,"&gt; You should never mix the two if the flame is lit.

I know nothing, but I feel like you meant ""isn't"""
258,"Bahahahaha, oh my gosh, dude, I'm dying. I had something similar happen to a pal a few years ago on a long hike. Unfortunately, this dude had food poisoning and... life sucked for him that day, but at least he was in the woods. "
259,"Put it in a bowl or something with those packets that absorb moisture (you know, the ones in beef jerky). Rice actually does little to nothing in terms of drying the phone out. The real benefit from people doing that was not messing with their phone for days.

Edit: I was talking about silica packets. Thanks /u/pravus_belua"
