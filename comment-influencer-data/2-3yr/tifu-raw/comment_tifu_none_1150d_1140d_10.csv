0," Bro, you have a second degree chemical burn from a very alkaline substance. 

Did you know nair is literally lye and lime? I don't see pictures, so I don't know how much damage you have done, but I recommend you visit a doctor's office or ED asap.  Get some bacitracin (or silvadene if you can't bacitracin) on those burns in the mean time and cover with sterile gauze. Do this twice a day. Your junk area is very prone to infection. I don't recommend googling Fournier Gangrene, but I am concerned for your manhood.  

Sincerely, a general surgeon

11,"Everyone is na√Øve the first time, so don't feel bad.  A few years ago, I went to pick up two of my sons from out of town to drive them home.  I come to a huge intersection just as the need for a coffee hit me and I thought, ""If I back up a bit, I can get into the driveway of the coffee shop.""  I looked into my rearview mirror by habit, and there was my dear son's face.  I go into reverse and slam right into a BMW right behind me.
Now, I'm a little old white lady, and out of the BMW leaped a massive young black dude.  And you know what?  The dude was shaking like a leaf crying, ""My girlfriend is going to kill me!""  I calm him down and suggest we swing into the parking lot of the coffee shop, which we do.  Then I asked him, ""When I got back into my car, did you take a note of my licence plate?""  ""No.""  ""You should have"" I replied, ""I could have just taken off.""
He had no clue what to do and was still shaking so I calmly told him how we had to exchange information, etc. and that I know I was fully responsible for the accident. I told him I would contact his girlfriend and explain how it was no way his fault, and that I would pay for everything.
It turned out okay in the end.  They got a legitimate repair quote and I paid it in full (outside insurance).
Moral of the story, OP, is that everyone is shook the first time.  Even seemingly huge menacing dudes who turn out to be big scardy cats who need a mommy character to calm them down.

I was terrified to be in it, and had been cast against my will as one of the leads, so I hugely exaggerated the pain. Stayed home and pretended to sleep. Weird thing though, the pain didn't go away. It just got worse. I was convinced it was just in my head, so powered through. I was in really bad pain for about a week. The last straw was when I woke up a 2 AM and thought I was going to die. My parents rushed me to the ER, where my father write 'stomachache' as the reason for the visit. Needless to say, it was hours before they got around to seeing me. I was in agony the entire time. They took me into a room, said to drink a gallon of red dye, and left me there another hour. They came back, took me to get a CAT scan/MRI, and said they'd have results in a few hours. Literally 10 minutes later the nurses came crashing back into the room in a blind panic, loaded me on a stretcher and rushed me off to surgery. I'd spent the last like 8 hours with a burst appendix. I was in the hospital for about a week and a half recovering."

Here's the thing: spinal boards float, but once someone is on them they sink like a brick. It took more than a few seconds for me to break my head out of the straps and resurface, gasping for air.

Pro: If you have this kind of pain you should see a doctor. It *could* have been appendicitis which could be deadly if ignored. Noone should have to wheigh their life against a potential medical bill. Evaluating if it is serious or not is what doctors are for!

Con: When it gets too easy, and no cost, to see a doctor many times people will tend go for any minor thing. This ties up the staff so lines are longer, or staff unavailable, for those who actually need treatment. 

Personally I think the pro outweigh the con. It's someone's life and health we are talking about. It should not come with a price tag. There are ways to mitigate the con."

I grabbed it and tried pulling it over my face as I was kicking like a madman to keep my head floating above the water, but I couldn't find the 'right way out' if it and I had tied it so hard it didn't loosen. I finally managed to get it off and at that point I had lots of tears in my eyes and was gasping and I just looked up at my friends to see if they were on their way to help me or what, but they were just standing there laughing.

Let's forget the prank itself at this point, how in the hell do you not look at both sides of the paper you have decided to take for yourself and repurpose? . I wonder what I would do. Prank or not isn't it common sense to check both sides of something (that is not yours or you are not familiar with) before you decide to deface/destroy/use? 

This is the part that I still don't get. You decided to use someone else's receipt. It only has two sides to check. one side has a hand written note on it. how do you miss that for the entire process of using and tearing it up into so many pieces? 
Did you even read what the receipt was for? What if they needed that receipt?

186,"I was born in Ukraine and lived through Chernobyl before my family moved to the US. When I was 26 or so, I all of a sudden started urinating every half our or so. I freaked out a bit, went to see my Primary Care Physician, only to be told that he was on vacation, and that his patients were being handled by another doctor for the week, who happened to be female. I was told to give a urine sample, and other than being dehydrated, they found nothing wrong with me at all (they thought it was a urinary tract infection). Still being all panicky, and not having an answer, I asked for further evaluation, and mentioned the Chernobyl thing to the female doctor, asking if my bladder issues could be caused by an enlarged prostate/prostate cancer. She sent me to the labs to have my PSA numbers checked, as the urine sample showed no signs of cancer activity either, but asked if I ever had a prostate exam. I was 26 at the time, and other than kinky sexual activity with my wife, had never had anything official/medical shoved up my ass. So the doctor tells me to pull down my pants, and to lean on the exam table so she could check my prostate. For some reason I thought it would be appropriate to break the ice with a joke, so I said ""Should I buy you a drink first?"" Her bedside manner shifted dramatically, as she was visibly not amused by my comment. She simply said ""no"" and proceeded to check my prostate with a gloved hand slathered in thick lube. Your explanation of how medical professionals approach exams of that nature has finally shed some light on one possible reason that her reaction was so ""negative."" It is possible that by joking the way I did, I inadvertently shifted her association of what was about to happen from something routine and work related, to something sexual, even if it was for a brief moment.   "
187,"Yeah but if it was OP he would probably goof up and say: ""I'm sorry that you have a shit face....""

Even the god might not share his den with OP at that point.

217,"So your initial plan was to permanently vandalise your friend's house with a sharpie, destroying his possessions and losing his rental deposit. Then you tore up a piece of paper without spending half a second checking what it was first. You know paper can have importance right? Even if it was a receipt like you thought, it would probably have been an important receipt since he bothered to keep it.

You sound like a selfish arsehole who doesn't give a shit about other people or their things. If this fuck up gets you out of your friend's life and makes you more considerate then it'll probably be a good thing for both of you."

However, the combined power of boobs and bubble wrap, sent me bouncing off the wall and on to my back. I just kind went splat. It didn't hurt, just winded me.

One of two things is gonna happen here.

One, they just wait.  You're tied to a board, and they have, likely, several buckets.  They just keep pouring, and you slowly, logically realize that you cannot keep this up forever.  The you have the realization, and likely dread, that you are gonna need to inhale soon, coupled with the eventual experience of it.

Or, two, they notice that you are slowly breathing out, and *hit you*.

You are being tortured.  They have no reason to play by some weird rules.  You get hit in, say, the stomach, you sharply inhale, you have a shitty day.

Other people were quick to prompt him to demand compensation from me (due to some racial issues, I am Chinese, not native of the country). I was shaken, I didn't say anything much. He turned out to be a decent man, he only asked me some little money to repaint the rear end of the bike.
