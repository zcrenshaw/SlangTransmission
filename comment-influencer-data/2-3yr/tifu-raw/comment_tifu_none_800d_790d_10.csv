0,"Genealogist here.  Don't panic, at least not yet.  The DNA services are notoriously terrible at IDing Native  American DNA, but I'm surprised that your dad wouldn't be on the rolls if he is 25%.  If you want to contact me directly I would be glad to look into it for you, check censuses, historical records, etc., for clues. I hope to hear from you.

Ok, so this blew up.  Thanks to you nice people who made positive comments.  To the others, sorry, I'm not a troll, not a Nigerian, and have no need to trick someone out of their info.  I like doing genealogy, I have Native American ancestry, and I thought I could at least point this guy in the right direction.  I apologize that I will not be able help everyone who contacted me, but there are lots of inexpensive or free resources out there.  Please don't misinterpret what I said.  The DNA testing services are reasonably accurate and lots of fun, but one thing they have not yet been able to identify very well is NA DNA.  Even if it does show up, they cannot tell you from which tribe your ancestors came.  The databases are growing and becoming more accurate every day.  But keep in mind, even siblings may have results that vary significantly.   It is not yet the perfected tool Ancestry might lead you to believe it is.  "
1,This was probably the best delivery of his life. 
2,"Ok, I have a VERY similar story, that gets WAY darker, I apologies in advance.

So when I was a kid we lived in a walnut orchard which had a small creek that ran through it. We used to take walks as a family around the orchard fairly regularly. One day we find this whole family of bunnies living on one side of the creek. These were not wild bunnies, they were clearly domesticated ones that had been let loose or escaped from someone and started breeding. So, I'm like 6, and I say to my Dad ""Daddy, can I have one please!?"" and he laughs and says ""If you can catch one, you can have it"" while clearly having zero faith in my 6 year old skills. He was very, very, mistaken. I immediately ran and lept across the creek, shoved my whole arm into the rabbit hole as far as I could, grabbed one by the tail and yanked it out. Looked back at my Dad with the biggest shit-eating grin ever, and my Dad's jaw dropped, and my Mom stated laughing so hard she almost passed out.

So anyway, my Dad had to let me keep it at that point, so we got an enclosure for it and kept it in the yard. He had a really nice house and I took great care of him. Feeding him and playing with him every day; I had earned that bunny and I was going to take care of it. 

So, after months of this I come home one day to find my Dalmation standing in the middle of the yard, with a bunny head hanging by one ear out of her mouth, and blood EVERYWHERE (at least in my memory). Bunny parts all over the yard, and my Dog thought she had done something awesome because she started bouncing around happy as could be. I screamed so loud my Mom told me later ""I had never heard you scream like that, when I heard it I thought 'well, that's it, he's dead or maimed'"". 

As a funny aside to that, a few weeks later that same Dog got hold of one of my 3 chickens. I caught her with it held by the neck, but not dead. So my Mom wasn't going to let that damn chicken die after the trauma I had been through with the bunny, so she took it the vet. But our vet wouldn't see birds, so she had to take it to an exotic bird vet. We sat in the waiting room with all of these people with beautiful expensive exotic birds and everyone going ""is that a chicken??"" and wanting to see it. She paid like $125 in vet bills, kept that chicken in a box for a month in the laundry room giving it antibiotics 3 times a day. It did recover, and it somehow managed to become even stupider than a chicken already is (which, if you've owned chickens, seems basically impossible) and laid double-yoked eggs for the rest of its life. Also, my Grandma lived with us at the time and she had Alzheimerz and everyday she'd go in the laundry room, then find my Mom and say ""Dear, that dog in the laundry room doesn't look so well"".

One of my most vivid memories from childhood."

7,I'm looking forward to your full autobiography. 
8,"What made them think *that* was the picture to use? The raccoon is literally in the center of the picture, I'd think anyone who didn't know Spencer or at least didn't know his name would assume it's the raccoon"

10,"The only nudity i ever saw on pizza runs was a 400lbs asian santa in an apartment with a 3 foot yinyang on the apartment door.

11,"hey mate, firstly big hugs because you must be feeling really bad. I have a son your age. If it was him in this dilemma, I would want him to feel comfortable to tell me rather than sitting there stressed out of his brain all night, on his own. I would also want to try and help him first thing in the morning, to get down and see if it got handed in. As a mum, the main thing which matters to me, is that my kids know I'm there for then no matter what. 

I don't know your parents, but hopefully they are similar, and you can go out and approach them for help.

Incidentally, a few months ago, a young refugee girl in year 11, approached me for help. She was looking for the bus company. She had left her laptop on the bus. She was actually a few blocks from the bus company, so I put her on the car and drove her over there. the laptop had been handed in. She was crying because she was so relieved. Miracles can happen. I really hope one happens for you. Bless xx

Edit. I am so happy that the OP got his computer gear back!! It's also really great to see all the people offering to help the OP. Way to go, Reddit! Reading about all the people who had valuable items handed in, makes me smile.

Oh and, um the girl was IN my car, not ON it... Haha that's what you get for Reditting at midnight on iPhone.  "
12,How did his grandma fuck up that bad?
13,"True story. Confronted my mother. Denied it at first and then a half hour later ""There was this guy..."" Doesn't know his name. Nothing.  So after 40+ years I find out my Dad is not my biological father and I have no idea who is.

My dad's taking it better than I am.

"
14,I wouldn't feel too ashamed OP. I used to deliver pizza in a busy urban area and stuff like this became pretty run of the mill after a couple months. One guy had his girlfriend show me her tits as a tip. Give yourself credit for brightening up his boring day.
15,I don't know if it was his grandmother lying or his parents lying to him to make him feel more special or something.  We never really questioned it because both him and my grandfather are much darker skinned than you would expect someone with entirely Northern European ancestry to be.
16,"I used to work in an area the had a fair amount of camgirls.  For awhile a lot of them would order pizza then answer the door naked for a shit ton of tips, and i always left with at least a $20 tip.  That was a fun few months lol.

22,"If this is actually true, There are several things that don't add up. Parental trust level must have been in trouble before the condom.  If parents gave you condoms, it is beyond comprehension how you were not asked directly if it was yours before they filed for divorce. If one is a doctor let alone a neurosurgeon, the basic math of teenager condoms and gf seem lacking. IF this is all true, who knows if you had spoken up if it would have mattered...they obviously had issues.. many people manage to stay together after an affair.  Their leaving you their wealth and house prior to death also doesn't really make sense either. But, If they did, then use it for good, whether you adopt the girl or help someone else do it. I am sorry for your loss but skeptical of the story."

24,"My husband's family had an ancestor that we were told was Native American. Her last name was supposedly Tenlegs. And it was rarely talked about by his grandpa because of the shame of it. 

Turns out we found the census where she had written her name and it was actually Tenley and just written with messy handwriting. The DNA came back with no Native American. Grandpa (and ancestors) assumed she was Native American because they misread this one census. "
25,The other tip he gave you was priceless.
26,"Pizza guy here: this is exactly why I ignore people when they tell me to come in.

I wanna thank my mom and my dad and the god that I don't believe in."
27,"I'm Polish too, but I can't stand Polish jokes. People never hesitate when it comes to Polish jokes. I went into a deli on Friday and asked for some kabanos, and the guy instantly said ""Oh, you must be Polish."" I could tell he was going to crack a joke, not hesitating like you'd expect a guy about to make an ethnicity-based joke to, and I said ""Because I ordered a Polish sausage? If someone came in and ordered a Belgian waffle, would you expect him to be from Belgium? If someone ordered French toast, would you expect him to be from France? If someone came in and ordered a Cuban sandwich, would you expect him to be a Cuban fella? What about if someone ordered a German bratwurst, would you expect him to be German? Or maybe if someone ordered a Turkey club sandwich, you'd think he was from Turkey?"" I couldn't believe the audacity of the guy to assume someone's background from a simple order of delicious kabanos. He said ""Well first of all, this is a bank."""

32,I'm skeptical about the results of these tests and think your dad should be too.  I did the 23andMe test AND the ancestry dna test (one was a gift) and I got different results.  So I think the whole idea might be crap.
33,I'm 50% Native American (I have family that lives on a reservation) and I would say it's fairly obvious that I am looks-wise. My 23 &amp; me said I was 0% Native American. Tell your dad not to worry about it &amp; keep going to the pow wows!

37,"Haha... People always tell me I have a fascinating life, but it doesn't feel like that to me at all. It's just my life, and it feels boring and full of lost opportunity. 

My father in law climbed mountains, raced cars, passed the bar, moved to Alaska and ran the Yukon Quest, and on and on and on. Next to him, my stuff feels small and insignificant. I guess you could say I kind of feel like a passenger in an interesting life.

88,"I absolutely agree.  You have a son with a girlfriend and a husband and you find a condom and girls panties, how do you not at least suspect the son, or even wonder if the son invited other friends over?  What kind of person jumps to ""my husband is clearly cheating on me and doing a terrible job of hiding it!""

Next, if your wife says she found panties and a used condom in the guest house and accuses you of cheating, do you even consider asking your son if it was him?  Did the husband try to do anything to clear that up?

The mother is a fricken neurosurgeon for goodness sake, pay to have a DNA test run on the sperm before you throw away an entire marriage.  Oh, results came back that it was a familial match.  Huh!  Who could that be? Probably could have saved us the trouble and suspected the 16 year old son.

The two of them were clearly having issues and at least one of them wanted out and this was a good excuse.  This isn't some tv sitcom where because of wacky coincidences they can't resolve the simple misunderstanding.  Real life doesn't work that way.

Perhaps the husband was having another affair, perhaps one of them just flat out wanted out of the marriage.  Who knows."

I had the test done about three years ago for myself out of curiosity.  Nothing really came of it until last Monday when a guy messaged me through their website.  He had just taken the test, and it was saying he was my first cousin.  He was adopted when he was two years old in the early 1950s and he was looking to find his birth parents.

We spent a few days digging and came to the conclusion he was my mother's half brother (which has same percentage shared DNA as a first cousin, which is why 23andme was saying he was my first cousin).

My mother has tons of half siblings through her father (he was a manwhore truck driver who drove around the country impregnating women the whole time he was married to my grandmother), so this wasn't a surprise to her.  We did put the guy in touch with a few of her half siblings in his area (they call themselves ""The Halfsies"".  That's how many there are) and they're going to meet."

I'm trained as a population geneticist and use these analyses. They're mostly used for conservation genetics, but some use them in industry for money. 

On a side-note regarding samples and samples sizes, with advances in coalescent theory, we can accurately estimate several population parameters (e.g. effective size, gene flow) using only a few individuals. The sample can dip as low as a dozen or so, given the life history of the organism.  "

We spent two days making jokes like ""I did Nazi that coming"" and talking about becoming alcoholics. Then we moved on with our lives. You might not think it's funny. But, we thought it was funny.   

But, for real, those narratives existed in our family for multiple generations.  We have genealogical ""evidence"" about some of this. It would be great to know if the tests are the modern equivalent of getting a star named after you or what. "
138,"I'm a pizza delivery driver and I had a girl open the door fully nude and posing tonight not quite as dramatic as this but still interesting. 

She heard me walking up to the  door on the wood porch and opened the door posing against the frame thinking it was her husband. She was pretty attractive  and the $40 tip didn't hurt. 

Good night to be a pizza guy"

141,"What I find most difficult to believe is that he watched the divorce happen and never spoke up. Like what kind of shit human being are you when you're watching your dad be accused of something you did and his life in turmoil and you actually have to think about coming forward about something you wouldn't even get in trouble over? You watched a 2-year divorce process going on, but you waited until a year after your parents lives were ruined to speak up? Bullshit. "
142,"My mom once told me I could go on a lake trip with a bunch of friends only if a certified lifeguard went. She thought this was pretty much saying no but having reasoning behind it. So I got lifeguard certified (classes were after I worked anyways, I was already 16 and pretty independent by then and would regularly just go over to a friend's for a few hours after work, so she didn't even realize I took a certification class). She didn't expect that at all and let me go because her requirement was met.

To be fair to her, it's a miracle nobody died on that trip because we were all a bunch of super-irresponsible teenagers with no adults.

I don't say no with conditions to my kids if I really just mean no because I can see them doing the same sort of thing.

Extra bonus: my job before this was staging construction sites for a friend of my dad, which basically means carrying heavy shit places where trucks can't drive. Lifeguarding is basically the most cushy job a teenager can get. It was a huge upgrade (and something I could do during the school year too)."

147,"Native Americans are usually one of two types:

There's the Funny natives. We laugh about anything and everything. I've heard the funniest native jokes from my family. *Why do the Indians hate the snow? Because it's white and on our land!"". Heh. However, most humor outsiders get offended easily. Lots of roasting, and very dark humor. I think it's a way of coping with the dark not so far back family traumas of the residential school systems. 

Then there's the angry natives. They have short fuses, stick to the bottle, and it's never a good time. Where I am from, our native reserve is the funnies. Family reunions are massive. Everyone drinks, of course, and up until the light comes up laughing and carrying on. 

Reserve about 45 minute south of us, opposite. Don't go there to party. It is almost guaranteed someone is going to get in a fight or stabbed. That reserve has a lot of pent up anger. Most bitch about how unfair their life is, live off of welfare, then spend their money on drugs and bitch about being broke and blame the white people. It's ridiculous.

156,"I'm not a geneticist, but isn't it actually quite feasible to have 0% of genes from one of your great-grandparents ?

For example, his Y chromosome definitely has 0% genes from his mother's father and 100% genes from his father's father; as far as I understand, for all the other chromosomes it's pretty much a random chance - you have a pair of them with one copy from your mother and father, and that means that they are copies from *two* of your four grandparents.

Of course, it'd likely come out differently for each chromosome, but many of them don't have much racial differences, so being ""1/8th"" of a known pure lineage doesn't necessarily mean being 12.5% like them, it means having a certain (low) chance of being 50% similar to that lineage, having a certain (high) chance of being 15% similar to that lineage, and a certain chance of having none of their genes whatsoever."
157,"hey dude, that fucking sucks, but just so you know, you have in no way ruined any part of your life, scholarly or otherwise.

firstly, absolutely worst case scenario, you repeat the year and in a few years' time you'll forget all about it.

australia also has great higher education programs. even if you flunk your senior year in highschool you can do a diploma at TAFE in whatever field you want to go to university for and be like 80% sure you'll make it into uni within that field.

Strikingly beautiful with a really tight blouse which appeared hastily thrown on possibly while drunk, a lower button unbuttoned and no bra. It was just that one button holding her back.

While paying she has a coughing fit. Time to see if I have Jedi powers. She's coughing and it pops, they spill out. She hastily flips around and rebuttons, including the one she forgot earlier. I finally offer something to drink, she finishes paying and practically runs out of the store. I was thinking, I didn't get a chance to thank her.

Over 25 years later, I remember it like it was yesterday. I kid, but honestly, guys don't forget a thing like accidental boob. We just get over it."

A comparison I've heard that I like is: trust is like a statue. It can take years to create. But it can be destroyed in minutes."

175,"&gt;a crippled guy came in.  
But I didn't want to hurt his feelings or anything, so I just went with it

As someone who has come upon mobility issues in the past few years of my life (in other words, recently become visibly disabled) what surprises me most is the random things that people will let me get away with, just because my walker or wheelchair makes them uncomfortable (I'm guessing).   
  
I first noticed this when I went to the opening night of the The Force Awakens. There were multiple long queues for the various theaters. I attempted to get to the customer service desk, to get the parking validated, before the movies started. I felt like Moses, parting all the queues. Everywhere I went, people parted and offered apologies. Several people even offered me spots in front of them in line, thinking that's where I was headed. They'd been waiting for *hours*, I'm guessing, but were happy to let a disabled stranger cut the queue.   
I found it really weird. After I got my parking validated, I went back to my spot at the back of the line. It's not like it mattered. The tickets had assigned seats.   
  
I appreciate it when people hold doors for me. Those are hard to get through. But when you start giving a disabled person weird different treatment....it just makes me feel like I'm invisible; all they see is my disability, and they don't know how to react.   
   
I'd love to hear if any other visibly disabled people have experienced this, and what they think of it.   
Is it different if you've always been visibly disabled? Should I get to cut to the front of any queue I want? How can I help people I meet in person see past my mobility device?  "

180,"Hey. I delivered pizza for years(Pizza Hut).

*manager back at restaurant* "" hey bro, she called back and only meant to tip 10 bucks, not 100""

194,"Coming from an admin at a school, it's unlikely you'll get your data if we have to run recovery programs. It's too much work with little chance of full success. Depending on how they have the system set up, the data could be there until reboot, until a scheduled task cleans out the computer, or until the machine is refreshed. If it's one of the latter two, you'll be able to log back in to the same machine and get your data back, which is the same thing your IT department will do.
That type of warning is to just say that we aren't responsible for your data being lost and we won't help you with any data that may or may not still be on the machine unless you catch us in a good mood and are nice to us.
