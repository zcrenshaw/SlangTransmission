0,I... don't believe this happened. But good story.
1,socialism probably
2,"Just tell every girl you meet they're the only one you'll turn for, a golden opportunity "
3,"When I was a teenager I thought I could use nair on my vag.


You think your armpits hurt? "
4,"One thing that really stuck out to me, was that everyone just congratulated you and was supportive. Your town sounds wonderful. "
5,"How could you forget to say ""no homo""? You could've avoided this whole situation!"
6,"Looking at the title, this isn't a story about blame but about someone nice giving solid advice based on personal experience. Sad you had to put in the edit. You're not an idiot, you were just being young and made a rookie mistake. Trust me, we all do somewhere down the line. Some get lucky and walk away with but a few scars, you didn't unfortunately.

My advice to you? If you start feeling down or sad about it, talk to a good friend or seek out (semi-)professional help. Don't be embarrassed about your feelings, it's not something small that happened to you.

I wish you all the best in life, though I think you'll turn out fine judging by how and what you write. You could've said ""I wish I just hit the kid."" or ""I hate my father for being an ass about it."" But you didn't, you only came here to warn others and hope that they will wear a helmet. Have my much deserved upvote, it's the least I can do."
7,Your wife's entire family (except the kids) sound like they all have corncobs shoved up their assholes sideways.
8,"No, because your costume wasn't perverted and the kids weren't being perverts... they were being kids.  It was the adults that took it to that level and caused the bullshit.  All they had to do was tell the kids to stop touching the nose on the costume because they might accidentally break it... and tell them to stop punching the costume because they may accidentally hurt you.  At no point did genitals need to be brought up, and at no point did they need to just assume that you were intentionally trying to get felt up by a pack of kids high on Christmas."
9,...hummus?
10,Your wife must've seen what you were wearing before you got to her family's place correct? Maybe I'm misunderstanding something but if she thought your attire to be inappropriate why didn't she ask you to change before leaving your house?
11,"Im assuming the sma town people associate hummus with gay people, hence the ""hummus people"" just like how my small town associates me and my boyfriend with a lesser degree of satan"
12,I don't think using the black light was your fk up.
13,My richard was too hard i forgot to say no homo
14,She told me I looked like a moron....I don't think she foresaw the events unfolding as they did either 
15,"Assert your dominance and jizz all over the carpet, then use a black light to show then"
16,"I'm guessing that ""safe, gentle, non-irritating"" label doesn't also apply to the eyes? "
17,A water bottle you don't open until after your plane ride? Am I misundrstanding? I've never heard of that
18,"I believed it at the beginning, but as it got worse and worse, it just couldn't be true. It was a good laugh though.

Edit: holy shit this blew up. Accomplished my goal of getting 1k karma on a comment. Now to waste another year trying to get gilded, and accomplish that goal."
19,"Ah, I don't miss my days working for EB/GameStop. 

-  had a guy who traded in a PS2 with severe pot smoke damage. The dude had to have been blowing directly into the console. Right before he leaves, he says ""oh shit!"" And tells me he left something in the expansion bay.  It was a baggie with a couple nugs in it. 

-  a kid traded in his GBA SP.  it was so full of sand that the buttons didn't work, we couldn't get the game out of the back.  The kid had buried it at the beach so his sister wouldn't steal it. 

-  a guy brought in a box of games. He was holding the box at arms length. I smelled something weird and sour. Quoth the guy: ""can I trade these for the same games?  A friend of mine got drunk last night and threw up all over my shit"".  To which my coworker responded, ""bro, get the fuck out of here with that shit"". 

Ah, memories. "
20,"Oh man. I used to get nosebleeds at the worst moments. Mine are like yours too. Nothing tops the one that happened during my calculus class. 

Usually, I can feel a nose bleed coming within the minute before, mainly due to the smell. I smelled the iron-like blood about to drip out during calculus class. My plan was that I  quickly run to get tissues that usually rest at the back of the class. 

Well, I fucked that up big time. When I went to rush to the Kleenex, I tripped. I stumbled for a good part, but happened to catch my composure at the last second. Embarrassed, I looked back to see a trail of blood squiggling from where I traveled.


Even more panicked, I ran to the bathroom covering my nose. As soon as I got to the sink, I **sneezed.** Blood covered the floor and the sinks like a gunshot splattered through out the bathroom.

I still had to clean it up but I just decided to wait out the rest of the class to pick up my stuff and clean up the mess I made"
21,"Build a million bridges but suck one dick; you're not a bridge builder, you're a dick sucker. "
22,"don't worry, just watch some Spongebob to cheer up"
23,Still very confused about gay people and puréed chickpeas w/tahini paste.   
24,"Incase anyone is curious of what all problems this kind of stuff can leave you with, here's when I deal with: anxiety, aura migraines, horrible coordination (I used to play piano and cello), really screwed up vision, twitching, concentration problems, sound sensitivity, occasional stutter, short term memory issues, mood swings, mental math is impossible, and sometimes I get overloaded by too much stimulus and will break down and start crying, plus a bunch of other small things that I've begun to be able to just ignore

Edit: Also can't sleep consistently or deeply, and no longer have normal dreams, only nightmares, which make the sleep problem worse"
25,"OP, I didn't *peg* you for a guy until the end of the story.

edit: My top ranked comment on this website is about pegging. Great."
26,"I don't think you're cut out for either profession, son. "
27,Women do love the opportunity to turn a gay man straight.
28,"VÄLFÄRD!

"
29,"Ay it's not too bad, yeah life isn't the same it was, but you just gotta deal with what life throws at you. I have my rough days, but I try to stay positive. Next time I see someone snowboarding without a helmet though I'm going to throw one at them and make them wear it."
30,At least it wasn't by pretending you didn't know what a potato was.
31,I cringed and I don't even have a vagina. 
32,"Man, I hate to tell this to you, but you might actually be at least bisexual if you love making out with a dude. "
33,"the dumbbell fuck-up was real but the torn pec, ouch. hope you get well soon mate.

edit: that was one hell of a speedy recovery op, I can't even imagine myself healing up that fast lol"
34,"Instructions unclear, dick stuck in  bridge "
35,"Damn, that's gay."
36,"A few years time...

""TIFU by throwing a helmet at a snowboarder not wearing one, and giving them permanent brain damage"""
37,"I know I shouldn't laugh, but this is hilarious (and I mean that in the most kind-hearted way... You told that story really well.) I love how you didn't give an explanation... You own it girl! You don't need to explain it; random eccentricities are fabulous and endearing as long as you can deliver on your work and do it well. At least you'll be memorable and not for a huge fuck-up. Good luck with the career."
38,"&gt;me and my friend, we'll call him Dave, start joking about being each others New Years kiss.

&gt;I don't really back off when it comes to kissing dudes or making out with another with them for that matter. 

&gt;we just go for it...we hold each other

&gt;one of the so called ""females"" notices us

&gt;we go at each other as if our life depended on it


Wellllll ya ain't exactly straight either (͡ ͡° ͜ つ ͡͡°)"
39,"Ugh those socialist countries. High quality of life ranking, low crime rates, healthcare and education as rights- *disgusting* /s"
40,You'll be getting your pack of glitter and skinny jeans in the mail any day now.
41,"Thank you so much! I just really don't want anyone to ever have to deal with these things, because of something so easily preventable. "
42,"I refer you to my opening statement about being an idiot.

I sleep deep, it is warm and nice after knackering day, and it's slow.  It's not a sudden burn, it's not like touching a hotplate.  And I'm an idiot."
43,"&gt;I have news for you...

According to WebMD, it's cancer. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold mysterious stranger!....what do I do with this??? How do I eat you???

D:"
44,"My dad made this error once but the other bottle was a bottle of super glue.  (He used to build model airplanes and such and always kept a bottle of both on his desk).  He said he realized just as he saw the drop descending and tried to close his eye.  He still got the glue in his eye.  It was the sort that takes a second or two to bond and he managed to keep his eye open and pulled his lid away from the eyeball.  The glue stuck primarily on the underside of the eye lid.  I took him to a doctor where they flushed his eye but they couldn't get the glue off the eye lid, so they sent him to a specialist.  That guy took a pair of tweezers and grabbed the corner of the glue and ripped the glue off.  I heard the scream all the way in the waiting room. 

He had a scratch on his cornea, no skin on the underside of his eye, and no eyelashes for a while.  "
45,What does this mean in American?
46,"Step one complete.
Where can I buy a blacklight?"
47,I say his in-laws are the perverts. Their minds went into the gutter the instant they saw him. The kids only saw a silly sentence.
48,It would be amazing if this was all a brilliant plan by his mother to confirm her suspicions about the slightly crusty texture of the carpet.
49,Hummus ~ homos
50,Only to the soul
51,"I'm sorry, I just don't believe it. Your mother, and grandmother have no idea what it is? Can we get a picture"
52,http://i.imgur.com/Ax8jlkb.jpg
53,This cracks me up. Maybe I'll softly toss it at them and give them the angry mom glare instead.
54,"You probably just inspired the repairman, I know what he's been watching that night. "
55,"So sorry to hear this, friend. This is terrible."
56,"An average white person eating hummus, is very likely to be someone who embraces cultural diversity, hence the eating of a middle-eastern / vegetarian food, possibly lives in the city, and espouses more progressive ideals, such as being more accepting of homosexuality. This isn't to say your racist country grandma can't eat hummus, it's just more likely that the gay city-dwelling grandson does. Does the stereotype make more sense now?"
57,[It glows!?!?](https://youtu.be/c7mVHH9fHuM)
58,You only know the ones that passed their first test because they told ya. Lots of us didn't pass the first time and I sure as hell didn't tell anyone. 
59,"Fakest thing I think I've read on this subreddit, but at least it was well written. How would his grandparents know it was a dildo but not his mother? "
60,"There should just be a sub called ""funny creative writing"" or something, but maybe part of what makes things funny is believing it really happened, at least for a moment, or if you're very gullible. "
61,Don't forget to mail him his gay agenda.
62,How on earth did that not wake you up?
63,"Lmao, just thinking about seeing the same dude who just f*d up the mirror now crying out for help under the bar and picturing people being like ""what is this dudes problem?"".."
64,"Hummussexual, I'm guessing."
65,Am I bisexual if I'd rather make out with Jake Gyllenhaal than an unattractive woman?
66,"heh

Got a nosebleed while doing a 100 backstroke in my varsity meet. Best time I ever got as well, but needless to say the IHSA had to take some precautions after the incident."
67,I dunno about perverts they just sound like uptight assholes. 
68,"No. This is a natural reaction. If you find a unmateworthy female approaching, then most males instinctively reach for the closest male. The reaction ranges from just holding each other, to kissing, to stripping and going deeper by the second. Thrusting, bustling, feeling each other's love leave their body and enter their platonic friend. 

The female is usually gone pretty quickly."
69,"They put them in those secure bags when you still have another security check to go through. If they are in that bag, they can get through the security check despite being over 100 ml. Schipol (Amsterdam airport) for example is a black hole for liquids (in my opinion) where they are a lot of random ""final"" security checks way after the tax free shops where people may have brought alcohol to bring home.

Never heard of being stopped and searched while walking though, what I would've expected from OP is he wouldve lost the water bottle at final security check."
70,If he asks you to go out again he's a keeper for sure
71,Wtf.
72,"Really..  
I'll give them TEN chances  
If by then there's no clear winner we shall try Ten more times"
73,http://i.imgur.com/DxxsKI0.png
74,"I bet you never tried to masturbate with Nair, did ya?  I'm convinced I'm the only idiot kid to have ever attempted it.  I'm pretty hairy and I thought ""hey!  I'll tug one out and take care of my pubes!"". I'm guessing what I was dealing with was chemical burns on my dick.  Pretty sure I still have a weird little scar from it.  This was 15+ years ago.

Edit:  Just to add a little more.  About 3 strokes in I experienced the most abrupt regret of my life.  I recall a terrible sense of embarrassment thinking ""how the fuck do I explain this dick problem to my parents and the hospital."". And a little bit of ""I've ruined my dick for life."" This is all while I'm in an exceptional amount of dick pain in a cold shower attempting to wash it off."
75,"I feel your pain..My wife's family is so dull and boring it's unreal! Every holiday is the same, boring sitting around nothing but casual conversation. I decided to bring a 24 pack to spice things up a bit and received the same looks as you did, even got the "" could you stop drinking in front the the kids please"". Mind you I'm 27 years old and no one has ever stated there was a no drinking policy.."
76,Wait... is this just a thinly veiled advertisement for PornHubs app?
77,"&gt;hey thats just another person, kissing another dude doesn't mean i enjoy getting my plum penetrated by another mans love stick.

Well that's a beautifully poetic way to put it."
78,"Wait, why is ""females"" in quotations? Is she not a female? Is she in a relationship? Who is she? Does she have any relations to the mysterious hacker 4Chan?"
79,Lies you tell.this cant be true..nonetheless its entertaining;)

81,"Lmfao, just laughed at the ridiculousness of stashing weed in the expansion bay and forgetting, I guess you gotta be pretty fuckin stupid to blow weed smoke directly into a console constantly"
82,"Your username goes with your comment like egg goes with caviar
"
83,"I'm not sure if you read the warnings but on my hand warmers it says ""Do NOT sleep while using a hand warmer."" I joked with my friends saying that nobody would ever do that but I guess that's what TIFU is for."
84,You can use the word republican here. We're a few levels deep in comments they can't read well enough to find us here.
85,WHY SPONGEBOB... WHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? 
86,"The gay guy at their work is a genius, that's why."
87,"Simply because of your reaction to Polish Remover.

Edit - Thank you stranger, for the gold on my silly pun that may have been a part of Hitler's military tactics. "
88,You just gave me a great idea 
89,"On my second date with my boyfriend, we were making out when I my nose started to bleed. Due to the alignment of our faces, my nose blood dropped directly down his nostrils. I was mortified and embarrassed for like a full month. 

Luckily he was a graduating med student and it barely phased him. It turned into a convenient way to have a conversation about our past medical history and STDs (which I did not have).

He loves to remind me of the story. I have no idea why. We are approaching one year of our relationship now 😄"
90,"We had a transit in Schipol and in our final security check, I had a small chocolate milk carton (I was 11) that they took to throw away. But me being my rebellious self, took it from her and chugged it all down and gave it back to her empty with a smug look on my face. You NEVER throw away my chocolate milk. "
91,Going back and having to re-read it after I realized he was a guy was a real pain in the ass
92,Please. Don't  share anymore tbh
93,"Btw, fuck your dad and ski patrol, at least a little bit.

Chances are, when someone insists they are injured, especially if it's a guy, and double especially of it's a young guy, always always always take their word for it immediately.

Young guys are *the* number one most likely demographic to pretend everything's okay and forego potentially lifesaving treatment for reasons of wanting to appear manly.

And all of that goes triple for hitting one's head. I mean, I'm sure your dad loves you and all, but that was clearly not his brightest moment.

But those ski patrol guys, they should lose their job and whatever pathetic excuse of a license is required for that job. Someone who is professionally tasked with medical care in any capacity and who tells someone who hit their head that it's “just a headache“ after what couldn't have been more than a totally superficial examination... people like that shouldn't even be allowed to work as cleaning staff in hospitals for the rest of their lives. Seriously, fuck those ski patrol morons who dismissed you like that."
94,Guess I just gave him the best christmas present ever.
95,That's horrifying. 
96,"Oh, Russia. Feel your pain, had a 20 hr Moscow layover. They wanted 300+ USD for a 24 hr visa just for me to be allowed leave the airport for a hotel in the city and return for my flight. 

So I called their bluff and slept on the floor. Was woken up multiple times by Russian guards asking for my passport. 9/10 I think they're just trying to sweat you. 

Edit: Sheremetyevo airport. "
97,"Anyway, a few hours have passed, the situation got sorted. 
Her parents punished her, it was cleared up that it was all a misunderstanding, and that she used me. 
The only outcome is that the sisters aren't speaking anymore.
Oh well.
EDIT - for those who don't wanna read replies about how she got punished - They took away her phone, laptop, internet access, all of that. Pretty much house arrest, for a long time"
98,"I got a bottle of peppermint vodka at my families gift exchange on Christmas Eve. 

Since I don't care for anyone further on the family tree than my grandma, I hit that bottle pretty heavily for the whole weekend, just drinking straight from the bottle, especially since the Christmas get together is at my grandma's, which is where I stay for visits.  I forget who, but someone asked if I had a problem since I was drinking this like soda, so I looked them straight in the eye, and said ""yeah. I'm stuck here with you people.""

My parents understand my contempt for extended family, so they started cracking up. "
99,Well... I just wiped it with my foot lol. Wiped it in and called it good
100,"This is written like its straight out of a sitcom. And no person would remember that much exact dialouge in an actual TIFU. The dad laughing for thaaat long is something only a quirky tv show character could do. You even have a part where a neighbor walks in, like how often does that actually even happen? Admitting the protagonist was a boy at the end was basically giving it away as fake.

Really funny though. Good read."
101,"Wait, you just fully made out with a guy as a ""joke"". "
102,The fuck is wrong with your dad? Is he one of those guys that walked 50 miles to school each day in winter with bare feet? 
103,Don't think about it too long or blood with shoot out your nose 
104,Either you're fired or you just won yourself a raise and a second date.
105,"They do have the ""sensitive area"" nair for bikini lines and such. 

The normal one though, whew lad "
106,"""And then I fell and my mouth landed on Butters' penis and I accidentally took a picture..."" "
107,"In my country, license testing are owned by several different companies.  When my evil cousin failed her license test because of a very obnoxious examiner, she wrote a very long complaint complaining on the examiner's behaviour such as rudeness, and not giving clear instructions.  

Here is the more fucked up part.

She is quite popular, and her networking is crazy, so she also had over 300 friends sign up to that company for license testing, but then they all withdrew after ""hearing rumours"" of how disappointing their examiners were.  They told that company they are choosing another company to get their license tested.  

That license company then sent my cousin an apology and offered a re-test free of charge.  The examiner had to apologise.

But my cousin was most likely a bitch."
108,"It's un-American is what it is, god dammit!"
109,Oh no... I've been made! Pack up and run boys
110,"Can confirm.  Ate some hummus the other day.  Saw a penis on the internet earlier and thought ""Hey, that's pretty ok."""
111,"Fuck it, good for you standing up for your brother. Should have pushed him over and maybe he would have got the idea."
112,[deleted]
113,That's a midwestern corncob with Nutella.
114,"Don't beat yourself up.  That was a clear case of nerves and I'm sure that the examiner has seen it happen a hundred times.  

Look at it this way, you should have fewer nerves next time because you will have a much better idea of what to expect."
115,You think that's bad? I was an adventurous kid. I liked it up the butt (am guy). I've even gotten things stuck but those are stories for a different time. Obviously I didn't have any real lube so I used what I could get. It was usually soap. I ran out one day so I found some in my parent's shower. But it wasn't soap. It was Nair.
116,I threw up on my husband on our first date.
117,I thought of this at the time. To mitigate the problem I wiped it in afterwords. Very little crustyness... but very very deep stains
118,I have news for you...
119,"Yea a big back to back fuck up haha, but thank you I'm workin on it!"
120,"Caviar is eggs, so... perfectly?"
121,"Just think, you spent *years* laying your carpet constellations out, far more time than you spent arranging those hanging from the ceiling."
122,"a penis in your mouth, apparently"
123,"Okay, so someone else had the same thing happen, at least someone who read this thread.

Suppose this is happening to every person who purchases this particular drone? Maybe this company actually only manufactured like ten drones, they keep flying back to the warehouse and getting repackaged before eventually resold?

Genius business model"
124,Guess she didn't like No Mans Sky
125,MY LEG!
126,"Old male lawyer here.  Interviewed for my first job with my ass absolutely soaked in water while wearing summer slacks that really showed it.  I had to maneuver through the whole process without ever turning my back on anyone.  I managed it successfully and got the job.  Your TIFU will make a great story you can tell if you make partner and some day end up mentoring the newbies.

On an entirely unrelated note, later in my career I ended up in an office where the managing partner was a cancer survivor who seriously counseled all of us to shut off our phones and spend more time with our families.  Our firm did remarkably well under his leadership.  Alas, his cancer returned and he was forced to retire early.  The new manager has us back at the grindstone.  I billed 60 hours this week and am still behind.  After 30 years I'm considering a job switch.  

Edit -  All of this is a roundabout way of saying the brass ring is made of brass.  You can still have a successful, rewarding career in a small firm working for less demanding senior lawyers and representing less demanding clients.  You're young, smart and funny.  Seems a shame to lock someone with your youth, talent and exuberance in a cage."
127,Thanks for the kind words! Glad I could give a laugh.
128,"What did the manager say? How are u still employed? More than half of the story is missing... also, why did I guys start playing this game?"
129,"Wtf

You took the time to wipe the carpet after? Why didn't you just splooge onto the thing you wiped the carpet with?

"
130,Take a picture of said dildo because I'm having a super hard time believing this one.
131,"Despite what you say, I think you might be a bit gay OP."
132,A funny version of r/nosleep if you will
133,"Someone (a christian pastor I suspect) is going to skim through this and start claiming hummus is 'infected with the gays'

134,"Just steal it from a local hardware store, they will understand"
135,It dripped into his nostril? Were you replicating the scene from Spiderman where he kisses MJ while upside down?
136,"now this might actually be true.....I'm going to have to investigate this one.

137,"Eh, I feel the biggest F up in the whole story is you not realizing 5 year olds can read. That's Kindergarten/1st grade homie."
138,Christmas for a lot of families is the only time of the year the older generation can force the younger generation in the same room to tell them how terrible they are doing and why they are living their life wrong. 
139,"A helmet's like a condom, wearing one can save you from some big headaches."
140,"This is actually pretty accurate for a lot of women. I've had many, many girls come onto me and tell me that they wish I were straight. 

Source: am gay."
141,"Wow, I've been eating hummus all my life, and I never knew I was gay. Thanks, reddit!"
142,That's just the brain damage.

144,I'm definitely seeing them again....I'm married.   They all live within an hour of me.
145,"I'm also a straight male who has no problems with LGBT couples and isn't into experimenting with other guys. But I've also never kissed a dude because I couldn't find a girl on New Years Eve. And I've definitely never made out with a dude hardcore just to make a point. Just saying, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's ok for it to be hummus business. Especially given that everyone that knows you two seems so supportive and accepting. Doesn't really sound like anyone's shocked, just like their suspicions were finally confirmed"
146,"I'm 57 (for generational reference) and imo the shirt is ""meh,"" I don't like it, but I wouldn't have a cow over it. The pants are awesome. I think the carrot is exactly where it is supposed to be and doesn't strike me as pervy at all. Looks like I think it's supposed to, as if you were getting a piggyback ride from a snowman. Very festive! Don't beat yourself up, really, you didn't do anything mean-spirited so you have nothing to be ashamed of."
147,So your thirst was quenched then? 
148,I was a teenager in the 90s - when nair came out there was only one kind lol 
149,How did it take people this long to make this obvious connection
150,Tastes very strange!
151,"I smashed my head off a pole at year 5 swim class. Bled everywhere, blood on everything, lifeguards looking at it and all the teachers are losing their shit


Im a qualified lifeguard about to start work at that pool, and i recently heard the people at the front desk wondering what happened to the kid that hit his head on the pole. I might tell them, but again i might not"
152,I got out of their as soon as I could hahaha
153,Sounds like a small deal to me.
154,Yeah just various shade of gay.. I mean gray 
155,"Oyyy... those look like chemical burns for sure. 

OP, make sure to keep an eye on your pits. Otherwise, have a damn good Christmas."
156,"Of all the countless paper products you could've gotten, you went with the one he couldn't use. 10/10 FU, I'm very proud of you.

In all seriousness though, UC sucks and my condolences to tour brother for having to go through it. I can't imagine how humiliating having to use a colostomy bag would be, especially in the rebellious teen years, let alone the physical discomfort it must bring. Best wishes to him."
157,"I once saw a busker who said ""I tell some jokes that may be inappropriate, but if you kids get the jokes that's on you, not me."""
158,"As opposed to a backwards welfare state where millions are handed out to corporations but if a poor family is given Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, certain lawmakers lose their minds."

160,"I'm confused, why did he lie and say it was for your youngest son instead of just telling you not to open it yet?

Seems more like a fuckup on your husband's part.

I am sorry for you and your youngest. Hopefully he's old enough to understand and won't mind waiting til you can make it right.

If you'd like, I'm happy to help if you'd be willing to accept it. I have amazon prime, so if you pick a prime item, it could be delivered to your house within 2 days. Pm me if you'd like to do that.

Don't worry Mom and Merry Christmas."
161,She might be like me and really enjoy pushing her family's buttons so she grabbed some popcorn and just let it all play out.
162,The manifesto's been folded into the ass of the pants.

164,"Serious question, can any part of your family tree be traced back to Poland?"
165,"Yeah tbh I use it on my asshole and as long as you don't leave it too long, it's totally fine.

One time I left it on too long, right before a date, and I was squirming in my seat at dinner. I just straight up told the dude how I had FU'd and he thought it was hilarious. We dated for a month or so lol"
166,"Do we get even a link to the video? You're out to the world now, might as well own up to it lol

All I'm saying is that had to be one passionate kiss to convince so many people."

168,"Also, why would you have to leave the house if the smoke detector went off? Wouldn't you just reset the fire alarm? This isn't a college dorm"
169,"Mm, true. I hear AT LEAST twelve or more derogatory comments toward the LGBT+ community everyday.

I have no idea why but I had two or three paper towels in my coat pocket took them out covered my face and got off at the next exit leaving and trail of blood drops behind me.  

People definitely thought they were going to catch Ebola from me that day.  "

182,"How to stop a terrible nosebleed. Take a piece of paper or paper towel (not toilet paper). Tear off a stop roughly 2 cm by 6-8cm (depending on thickness). Roll it up and put it under your upper lip as far as it can go, centered. This pinches off the blood vessel that goes to the capillaries in your nostrils. It'll stop any nosebleed in five-ten minutes.

I apply 4-5 times a day in heavy winter with all the dry heat.    

Also.   I found that I'm more dehydrated in the winter than I think I am.    Dehydration allows for the polyps and nasal cavity scaring to crack and when that happens 
Its red river time.     

The best medicine is preventative with the spray and water.     Drink a lot of water in winter.    "

214,"While not the same scenario as yours, my wife's family gets very annoying when they all get together and fights are inevitable at that point. This introduces a lot of unnecessary stress during the holidays. Our solution was to time everything perfectly and limit the amount of time we spend with them. We now get there early so we can leave just after everyone arrives, so we have time to greet everyone and we can leave with a nice ""well, we have to see my family as well"". It took us a few years to get the timing right and for the past couple years I've been having my best adult Christmases. "

223,"Lpt, you can prevent gay feelings if you say ""no hummus"" before looking at penises."
224,No the grandmother knew. She just didn't notice it at first cause she was doing it absentmindedly. Mom was the only one not in on the joke and I've for sure seen some dildos that you might not realize if you're particularly naive.

For your sake, if he's a decent guy, he won't cash it. And think to the future, if you can't put yourself first and consider you may need the cash in event of an emergency, save the cash to spend on a future someone who truly loves you and wants to be with you no matter what."
230,"We got him, Reddit!"
231,"As someone who also suffers from terrible nosebleeds, a tip.

Vaseline.

No, not for wanking. You put a dollop up your nose with a Q-tip, swab it about till it's covering everything, then stuff a bit of cotton wool up there for about twenty minutes or so (or else all the lovely lubricating goodness will melt and drip right out your nose.) Once it's absorbed you take the cotton out, et voila.

It feels really gross, but it actually works."
232,"That is an amazingly generous offer, thank you!  He's been quite mature about it, reassuring me that it's ok.  He knows there's a check for him in the mail.  But I know he was fighting tears at one point and he disappeared to his room pretty quickly. :'( 

Idk why dh did it that way... He has brain damage and gets confused/doesn't think things through clearly.  Usually I don't get anything Christmas day, so maybe he was trying to surprise me?

He can't get out on his own and has to ask me for spending money because he loses track and overspends; I had to take the cards and checkbook away when we ended up almost $1,000 overdrawn and he couldn't remember what he spent it on - that was when he was still driving, tho he didn't drive for very long after that.  Scary, I know.  It's fucking hard to take that stuff away from an adult who is still there enough to know what he's losing, but not there enough to do anything to fix it.  His family didn't believe me (or the drs reports) and thought I was going to take his assets and the kids and take off.  It was a whole thing.

Anyway.  Sorry.  It's been a really emotional Christmas for me.  He's terminal but we don't have a real time frame, could be months could be years, depends on too many variables.  Last week he didn't know who I was for the first time.

Sorry for going on. 

TLDR Shit's been really hard and thank you for being kind to me.  It means more than you know. "

252,"In the interest of making this less of an echo chamber with everyone going ""OP did nothing wrong!"" I'll agree that it was indeed you who fucked up. Your family-in-law might be too serious, no fun people with a metaphorical stick up their ass. You, however, are a grown ass man and should know them well enough to have a good idea how wearing a dumb outfit essentially sexualizing Christmas symbols will go over with them and reflect upon this BEFORE you wear said outfit to their family get together. The fact that your family enjoys goofing about on Christmas is jolly fine, but there are those who view the holidays with some solemnity and don't appreciate that stuff. You probably didn't go from the ""fun uncle"" to the ""creepy perverted uncle"", but rather from ""that goofy guy we don't mind"" to ""that ass with no respect for our traditions."" Just man up and go visit them for new years or something and apologize for being that ass and everything will probably be forgiven.

He was down to earth so he didn't care. We ended up at his place later that night and he was like ""we're probably not fucking tonight, huh"" and I told him it would probably be a couple days till we could. Ha

I value being straightforward and don't really have time for people who can't handle it, so I'm upfront about things. I wanted to sleep with him so if he was put off by the conversation, it would have been a good indicator that I should probably not get my hopes up."
