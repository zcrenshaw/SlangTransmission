2,You see Jim had a grandmother who just lost her house to taxes.  Jim was working on his golf game to earn the money to pay the taxes on his granmas house so she wouldn't have to live in a home.  Now some guy named Shooter is about to buy that house because he was never able to get in touch with the old golf pro at the country club you promised to get him in touch with to help him with is golf game.  It's sad man.  Real sad.

9,She asserted her dominance over you. 
10,"I can't believe that you were stupid enough to post this on facebook by tagging her in it, but didn't check her profile to see if there was a ""Stacey"" that you could tag. If you hadn't been so lazy with your tagging, you'd probably have found her cousin and wouldn't be sad and alone."

Also, UPDATES!"
13,"Not a fuck up by no means. I had a lab for sixteen years. Watched him and the rest of his litter be born in to the world, picked him out from day one, picked him up from week two. Celebrated all his birthdays and every Christmas with him. He got old, got blind, senile and deaf. Couldn't control his bladder, and became disoriented easily. Finally made the call the day he couldn't stand up and peed on him self. I held him as the vet injected him and cried with him the whole process and after he was gone. It still hurts a year and a half later. This is a family member, and it's never easy. "

15,"No good deed, my man. Know at heart that you did the right thing. Hopefully the universe will get you back soon, because that's a weak way to get repaid for saving a person. "
16,"So, listen up. I'm an old guy. 

My first marriage was to someone who sounds a lot like your fiancee. Particularly the slapping part. Let me tell you - that part never gets better. It only gets worse. It isn't funny, or cute, or just how she is: it's assault, same as if it was you slapping her.

People who treat other people like that are assholes. Yes, they can be sweet when they want something, but after five years, when you have nothing left for them to want, when they control over all your stuff... yeah. Then you'll see some slapping.

Listen, OP. Go into the bathroom. Look at that guy in the mirror. Ask him whether he should be marrying this woman. He knows the answer; you and I know the answer. She's selfish, and she's an asshole. You only stay with her because you don't think you can find anyone better.

You can find someone better. Anyone who doesn't hit you is better, and there are tons of women who don't assault their boyfriends. I stayed with my ex-wife for 12 years because I was afraid of being alone, when in fact being alone (when I finally got fed up and left, much poorer and much wiser) was much better than being with her. Nobody was hitting me, for example.

You know what you should do. Now you just need to grow some balls and do it. As hard as it is now, it's going to be way harder after a wedding and mingled finances and car loans and gifts from parents and, god forbid, children."
17,"This isn't just TIFU though, this is clearly 'I'm an immature asshole and it's a good thing I'm not getting married'. Not exactly a once off thing."
18,Lazy tagging is really only like the 157th item on the list of reasons why OP is stupid
19,You should be able to quickly call the bank and get them to stop those payments.
20,"Why does everyone have to air their dirty laundry on Facebook, I just don't understand why telling everyone about the worst parts of your PRIVATE life seems like a good idea.

24,"Well if there's random violet water leaking from places at your company, I think that's where the focus of the problem should be at.

Especially if you guys are handling expensive paint."
25,"Was it too hard to give her a call or ask her, ""who is the dude?"". I think a relationship gets through with trust, how much idk, but there has to be some. 
You not only distrusted your fiancee, you showed her how stupid you are, not only calling her a cheater, but also publicly on ""Facebook"" (that is on another level). 

I trust that your ex-fiance dodged a dumb bullet.

imo: or for my own amusment, she could have been cheating on you with her cousin, and for your recklesness, you will never know. This kind of creepy stuff happens.-

61,"the only time in my adult life I have ever actually been punched in the head was at a music festival where things were getting pretty heated and wild up the front of the crowd and I notice amidst the mosh a dude on the ground getting trampled to shit. I muscle in and clear a tiny bit of space for the guy and notice he's going totally blue. I was a silver medallion surf life saver and had a tonne of first response training under my belt at the time so I just sort of autopilot into going through the motions - clear some space, get him into the lateral position, confirmed a pulse but no breathing, had already communicated with some bystanders to go fetch first aid team and was fully prepared to begin EAR and then suddenly I was just seeing stars. some dude who was I guess this guys friend was just laying into me and absolutely nailed me with a punch to the back of my head. the guy kept kicking me and telling me to give him space the whole time I was trying to piece together what the fuck was going on. Slithered out of there asap and flagged emergency crew who got in there and fixed the guy up and the dude was still calling me a piece of shit so I just bailed.

Really hurt, had terrible head pain and kinda ruined the whole festival for me.

Turned out to be a reoccuring problem with her that she had since she had given birth and i never understood why she didnt wear incontinence accessories. I wasnt mad about the piss, i was mad that she didnt wake me up and was going to let me sleep in it while she snuck out."

67,"Jokes in general around planes don't usually go over well. I got kicked off a flight to Las Vegas for a joke I thought was spectacularly funny.

111,"Career banker here: Yeah, you fucked up - but they did worse. Is this the US? If so, they endangered a lot of lives for federally insured money. Part of banking security typically emphasizes ""GET THEM THE HELL OUT!"" In all potential robbery situations. Guards typically aren't allowed to carry guns, and if they are it's because they're off duty LEOs or are in high crime areas that need the extra visible threat. Creating a potential hostage or shootout situation based on that little interaction is dangerous at best, and criminally liable at worst.

About the ""You never joke about robbery in a bank."" Rule. Yes, please don't. It makes us uncomfortable and is awkward - and never funny. That said: It happens ALL THE F*CKING TIME! There is no reason that any security situation should have been created over a bad, inappropriate joke that happens 10 times a damn day.

In fact, all the banks I've worked for and many of the ones I'm familiar with would have done the following: Guard &amp; whoever sounded the security alert would have been let go before the end of the day. Client who was in there would be met by high level execs to make sure she didn't sue (which she can do). You would have been issued a formal appology for the over reaction, and also met with execs to make sure YOU don't sue, and the police would have issued a citation to the bank for creating a false alarm - which may or may not involve a fine.

In fact, if you ARE in the US, I find myself highly doubting this happened (no offense... well, not much offense). If you're not... then ignore everything I said, I hope you're OK, and please be more careful next time :)"

115,"Most banks complete their transactions overnight.  The way it was explained to me is if you put a charge on a credit card, like $1 to verify that the card is legit, a hold is placed immediately on that credit card account for the impending payment.  When the banks ""talk"" that night, it gets sorted out.  That temporary hold comes up, the credit company says, ""Hey man, looks like we owe you $1.""  The payee bank, seeing it's a temporary hold to simply check the legitimacy, basically says, ""Nah man, that's not owed. We good.""  The credit company deletes the hold and things move on."

121,"""Today I fucked up by being a complete imbecile"""
122,"I think I get what you're saying, and while I somewhat agree..

The ""fuck-up"" was assuming, with certainty, that his fiance was cheating on him without having once spoken to her about it. Without even seeing the need for doing so, that is arguably an affect of immaturity. 

The rash attempt at ""revenge"", though, was purely the result of his being an asshole (cowardly vindictiveness is not necessarily a *shared* characteristic of the immature..), and likely what contributed the most to their engagement being called-off. 

Meaning the consequences were *deserved*, in this case. Their split-up wasn't the result of a mistake (or ""fuck-up"") but a more complete assessment of his personality by his fiance. At least someone made the right call in this scenario.."

The meds he took for that messed up his kidneys, and the meds for that messed up his skin.  He slept a lot more, and we knew that it was going to be time to call the vet.  

One day, as you do, the vet was called.  They came to my house on a Saturday.  Everyone was there.  My dog was *so happy* that everyone was there, although he knew something weird was going on.  But that's okay, everyone's here and there's a yard and we're outside, and outside is the best!  I like this yard, because my buddy the hummingbird always comes by!  Hey, there's a new person!  I wonder what they smell like!  

""Oh,"" as he smelled the vet, ""okay.  Today's my last day.""  

He went to everyone in turn, wagging, getting one last pat.  Everyone except me.  When he got to me, he just sat down.  ""Badhunter, thank you for letting me stay in your cave.  It was very nice.  I have to go.  Look after your puppies.""  

I hugged him, and the vet walked behind him and gave him his injection.  He barely flinched.  After a few seconds, I could tell that all his pain was gone.  I hugged him until he was too heavy to hold, then let him down onto the ground and patted him.  ""See you next time.""  I patted him until the vet touched my shoulder.

You keep running back to her because she's your most recent relationship and she's the only thing you've known for 8 years. You're probably a good person who is holding onto those ""good days"" as a little bit of hope that she'll just turn normal... but she's in her mid 30's so I don't think she'll ever change. Most likely it's only going to get worse from now on.

Run. It sounds like she is suffering from bipolar disorder. She needs professional help and you need to run for your life. Change your phone number. Move far, far away. Cut off all contact with her. Before something really bad happens. 

Get counseling if you need help exiting a toxic relationship. But for the love of God do NOT marry her. It's not right to bring kids into this hot mess. Think of the ring as a stupidity tax and just fucking run, man.

166,you were wearing a vest????
167,"Even if it doesn't work, you'll be too drunk to know!"
168,"Even if you lived with the extended family my university wouldn't make the exception. Yea, mom/dad are abusive druggies and your grandparents raised you since you were 10 and one passes away, screw you.

Got to love academia."
169,Your only FU was using so many different names for the one guy; it made it hard to follow the story.
170,"To add to this: $40,000 (or any amount of money for that matter) isn't worth a lifetime of misery. Do the math, if you marry for life you're staying with this awful person to save $1,100 a year."
171,"I'm gonna go the serious route here and will probably get downvoted because of it, but your willingness to make an impulsive, life altering decision, and publicly shame someone over a personal matter on the internet of all places indicate to me that you might wanna seek professional help. This wasn't some girlfriend of 2 weeks, this was your fiancee. "
172,"Here's where you messed up - before you threw your phone, you should have taught it the move Harden. "
173,Reading all the comments here make me glad I never got into drinking coffee. 
174,"Yeah, you think the wedding was costly, just wait until you see the divorce. "
175,wtf
176,Thank you :) unfortunately we don't receive karma for sticky comments :(
177,"So you spent a bunch of other people's money that you didn't have to begin with, and when you didn't have the money to pay it back, you just kept ignoring/challenging them hoping that it would just go away?

And you somehow think it's okay to waste other people's time and money who did you a favor to begin with by loaning you money?

Edit: To be clear, I'm looking out for OP by pointing out their real FU; their lack of financial integrity, and it will cost them in increased insurance premiums and decreased opportunities down the road; which would surely have been more valuable in the long run than any savings from ""wear[ing] them out"".  If OP had just made the minimum payments, would their car have gotten FU in the parking garage that day?  How much time did they have to take off to go to court(and dealing with their car) that they could have spent earning money at a job?  How much did they spend on gas to get to court?"
178,"Wow, that sucks and I'm sorry to hear that. Don't let it discourage you from ""doing the right thing"" again in the future. What is more important, a human life, or your material possessions? Your story indicates that you already know the answer to that. Thumbs up.

Also, at first, I didn't correctly read the title, and I thought this was going to be some elaborate reference to the Phil Collins' song ""In the Air Tonight"". I was disappointed it wasn't until I read the entire post.

*edit - re-read the post and saw that you actually took part in saving him, deleted portion of my post*"
179,"&gt;Did you mean penny ante? I don't know what the hell panty anty means

I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think his use of panty anty is understandable in this context. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it’s a peach of cake."
180,to a party??? while riding a bicycle????
181,"300 kilos also equals 300,000 grams. 

I'll just let that sink in."
182,"TIFU = Totally Increased Females' Understanding

Sometimes posts here don't look at it from all perspectives. Four kids and fucking around like that, Lieutenant Multiplenames is a douche, and OP kind of is one a little too if all they're thinking about is the guy in this story. "
183,He thought you were a meeseeks.
184,"You never heal from losing a dog. They just show you it's OK to keep loving, no matter what. "
185,I was wondering why she would break things off so quickly over a badly delt with miscommunication. Then I realised OP might do things like this often. 
186,"On facebook no less. Hard to believe it can be such a central aspect to peoples lives.

Like, assuming this is true - prior to facebook - would this person have sent emails around to all of their family and friends?"
187,"he probably knew it was you, and pissed on you on purpose"
188,"Or, hell, even if you absolutely insist on it, do it AFTER you confront her."

190,"&gt;Way to make me feel bad, Jim.

way to make it all about you dumbass. 

"
191,"Am I the only one here that thinks a follow up question should have been asked when told about stacey?

I.e. fiancée: hey my cousin stacey is coming down for a few days...

Me: Where is SHE coming from?
                          or
Me: What do you guys plan on doing?

 Eventually I'd  hear SHE... or HE....."
192,Urinetime lawyer checking in. I handle everybody's things from here on out.
193,OP make sure your wife gets in x-ray in all seriousness. A  broken facial bone is not fun at all.
194,&gt;He ~~is~~ was probably the senior staff member. Easy mistake to make but that fricken suuuucks
195,"Pilot here: The seat cushion also floats in sand!

I thought it was funny but you may have been removed per ~~14 CFR §91.17(b)~~ 14 CFR 121.575(c) which prohibits aircraft operators from transporting visibly intoxicated individuals."
196,To be fair to OP if your passport is so damaged simply dropping it cleaves the cover off you should probably have already got a new one. Sounds like an accident waiting to happen. 
197,"Maybe he was just an old fart looking for some company. I've met plenty of older Uber drivers and most of them seemed to be more interested in having a pleasent conversation with their passengers rather than make money. Damn, now I feel bad for poor, old Jim."
198,How do you know it was 50 quid? ;-)
199,[deleted]
200,"We all pay for it, we just pay a different price.

Watching free porn online consumes your soul. 

Support your local pornstars.
"
201,"What the fucking butts. He starts wailing into a first responder for not giving his friend breathing room. Fucking irony. 

I bet he'll turn into one of those arsonists who lights things on fire so he can fist fight a firefighter. "
202,You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
203,Rather a NLPT (NoLifeProTip). This is reddit so 90% of post could go to NLPT.
204,Or a cactus
205,"And then we wonder how accidental it was, don't we?"
206,General rule of thumb - Don't inform the police you're an international weapons smuggler. 
207,The visual of Septa Unella riding a beach cruiser made me lose it

209,Better still - envelopes with poisonous glue :)
210,"Dude. I did the same thing (minus the huge wedding) and the marriage lasted a year. The money isn't coming back whether you marry her or not. 

Run away fast or it will only get worse."
211,"I guessed what was going to happen before reading fully and was cringing so hard so *hard* for you. Nooooooo

Edited to include: hope you had many inches left "
212,"I cracked up at ""instead give it to your friends"". I may have to use that at some point.

Sucks though about the keyboard."
213,"Sunk cost fallacy much, bro? Call the vendors, cancel everything, get your deposits back. Salvage the relationships with your sisters, and never contact this woman again. Or, continue to be miserable for the next *x* years of your life until you finally realize you want to be free and get a divorce, at which point things are got to cost a lot more than they are now"
214,"This is terribly sad. Go easy on yourself, it was a genuine TIFU and was motivated by a desire to give your guinea pig a nice experience outside.  "
215,Seems like a good solution for deporting excess seniors
216,"I sometimes feel lucky my first girlfriend was crazy.  It sucked at the time, but in retrospect, it was like crazy boot camp.  I can assess the situation, identify exit routes and act without hesitation.  The training just takes over.  You could drop me in the ISIS of crazy girlfriends and I could get out with some twine and bubblegum.  She trained me real good.  

""THIS IS MY CRAZY GIRLFRIEND. THERE ARE MANY OTHER CRAZY GIRLFRIENDS LIKE HER, BUT THIS ONE IS MINE.""

That was around 20 years ago and I still get a couple calls a year for her from bill collectors.
"
217,Excellent for guitar fretboards. It's also used for the black keys on pianos.
218,I hate people that air their private shit on public forums. I don't understand the point. It is embarrassing for everyone involved and everyone who reads the posts. 
219,Bank of fucking America is right. That's what they do. 
220,"I always have a little bit of anxiety when I am making large payments too but I screwed up. 

When my co-worker informed me what I had done I dropped a nice professional ""fuck my life"" in a very loud manner. 
"
221,"Most fuck ups on here are genuine mistakes, or things that couldn't have been forseen. This is outright stupidity."
222,"&gt; ordered neatly 2 billion dollars worth of shoes

I would hope so, that many shoes could get very untidy."
223,What you seem to be saying is you hate personal irresponsibility. Like people who get fucked up and do stupid shit and try to blame that on the drugs. 
224,I identify as a Nokia
