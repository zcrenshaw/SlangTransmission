0,"Dude at least he said thanks. I noticed a young guy drop a load of notes on the pavement earlier this week. I picked them up, about £80 I reckon, I shouted, nothing, I whistled, that got his (and everybody's) attention. Anyway hes looking at me looking at him and checks his pocket, then comes walking back to me, like no rush, got to maintain looking cool. I said you dropped this man. ""Oh huh"", takes it and walks off. Not so much as a thanks! What a prick. 




Edit: well I didn't get a thanks from the individual, but I did get some sweet karma, and isn't that what good deeds are truly for anyway.

I also got a load of great stories from you guys, this is going to keep me very entertained for hours. 

Thank you. Or should I say ""huh, whatever""."

9,"Could be worse (true story).

My fraternity brother started a night like yours, first semester in, shit hammered drunk, some girl that wanted him dragged his drunk ass home to do the dirty. She was also drunk off her ass.

She was on top, and pushed on his stomach, resulting in him puking straight up in the air, in her face, all over her sheets, all over himself.

She went to take a shower, told him to clean up his mess and said where the washer/dryer was. Dutifully and drunkenly (also, naked, in a sorority house) he stripped the bed, re-made it with clean stuff, and threw it in the wash.

She got out of the shower while he was putting it in the wash, went in her room, locked the door, and went to sleep. Drunk girl forgot about him.

He went back up stairs and hopped in the shower to clean himself off. By the time he got out, she was solidly passed out and wouldn't open the door. 

In a borrowed tiny pink towel, in the hallway, he decided to go to sleep. Towel didn't stay on long, because her sisters returning from the bar found some random naked guy sleeping in their hallway, in a puddle of piss. They kicked him out in the piss soaked towel. No shoes, no phone, no keys.

He walked back to campus, but couldn't get in the dorm, so he camped out at a picnic table until some other people came back and he could follow them in. Realizing he can't get in his room, and with his RA already hating him, he decided to just go nap in the bathroom until morning.

He stumbled into the girl's bathroom. Some girls walked in for their morning ritual, saw a naked guy on the floor, and called UP. Some cops woke him up and took him for a little ride before letting him go.

By ""let him go"" I mean ""allowed him to walk out of the station on the far side of campus, and back to the dorm he still can't get into, wearing nothing but a tiny pink towel, right around noon when the campus is bustling."""

14,"Invitation in the late

Alcoholic movie date

Brings a pizza and some beer

To drive the date to second gear

Roommates bring a whiskey bottle

Drinking takes a higher throttle

Has a couple, maybe five

Tipsy past the point to drive

Invitation for the night

Slamming bodies now in sight

Teasingly removes her sweater

As her date is getting wetter

Sees her tightened corset laces

Heartbeat is off to the races

""Would you

Could you

Please undo""

""Girl, it'd be my pleasure to""

Freaky fast like Jimmy John's

The speed at which her date responds

Is startling, he's startled back

He trips while staring at her rack

Infatuated, balance weak

He stands up with a bloody cheek

The almost super lucky guy

Has scored a swollen blackened eye

16,...so what happened to the poor guy who ordered the pizza
17,No you wouldn't have. You'd have posted about it on reddit like the rest of us. 
18,"Hey, at least now you can tell people you had to go to the hospital for your nose and slip the ass laceration under the rug.

22,"If this story had the genders reversed, you wouldn't be the asshole in the story. She would be for taking advantage of a drunk person, who narrowly avoided the situation by pure chance of an uncontrollable bladder (due to drunkness).

Let's face it, when she saw you at the party covered in wine, she knew you were drunk and targeted you. At least that's how the story would have been perceived in reverse."
23,"Precisely. Throwing something in your face while you are driving a vehicle with your children in the backseat because you guys got into an argument is a Grade A cunt move. She could have gotten you *all* killed, and in the heat of the moment, you lashed out. I know there's two sides to every story, but the way you tell it, it sounds like she was playing the victim role up *hard* with the whole claim that you wouldn't let her out of the car and the ""He's coming back"" bullshit when she said she didn't know where she was and you went to go check the sign and tell her.

You also have your children as witnesses to the incident, which is unfortunate, but they would have seen her throw a drink in your face before the car went out of control. If that sort of action isn't enough to excuse a slap in a heated moment then there really is no justice in the world. Just because she's a woman does not excuse her actions, and the fact that all she got was a slap after she almost caused the death of everyone in the car speaks volumes to your character. "

34,"Ask her/the cops to drop the charges.

If she/they will not, get a lawyer (a real, a good lawyer).

Fight this thing. You slapped her, it is true, but she threw a cup of soda in your face when you were trying to drive your car. She is the one who is in the wrong in this situation. She endangered you all. It sounds like you were driving a bit too fast, so that is on you, if true, but in any case, she did not need to call the police and LIE to them. This is an important point. She LIED to the police when she told them that you punched her. Calling the police will almost never make these types of situations better. 

Get a lawyer and fight this. Even if you have to borrow the money to pay the lawyer. But, make sure that you get a lawyer who feels like he will win it for you. "

50,"I've been on both ends of the spectrum. I have picked up items people have dropped and returned them only to have them stare at me like I'm some sort of creep or that I'm about to ask for something in return.

One time though this lady dropped her phone in front of me in a checkout line at Target. It must have called through her cart because she didn't realize it and neither did I at the moment. It wasn't until I was about to walk away with my items that I noticed it. I clicked the home button and saw a picture of her and who I'm assuming to be her husband in the background. I ran outside as fast I could and saw her just about to get into her car. I yelled and said she had dropped her phone. She was extremely grateful and she wanted to give me some money as a thank you. I declined and we went our separate ways.

About a week later my girlfriend and I went out to eat at Olive Garden. I couldn't help but notice that our waitress looked really familiar and she kept sort of looking at me like she knew me too. We ordered, ate, and when we were ready for the check, the waitress asked if I was at Target about a week ago. I said yeah and that's when I realized she was the woman who's phone I found. She proceeded to thank me even more and when I went to grab the bill, she took it and said it was on her.

I really don't see how you fucked anything up. Sure you're paying for a couple of drinks, but you're getting out of it exactly what you wanted.

87,"You can spare a minute in-between. System isn't designed to turn people away and there's other people generally in the back and available to help out. 

There's generally a walk in option too. When this rolled out a lot of people took the appointment system too literally which is his managers fault for not teaching that out. 

Generally you grab the pick up and then you're supposed to demo the repair. You can give the customer the option to decline that demo and simply take it home. It does take literally 2 seconds and you can have your repair tech print the paper work out to the front. 

OP refusing to do this guys pick up because he had appointments is, no offense OP, completely unnecessary.

EDIT: A lot of people are seeing this so let me just wrap up my other comments here for further clarification on some things, mostly to defend OP.

This is a super high stress job. People are SO stressed about their computer. I have seen grown men need to turn their phone over and put their head on the counter and CRY. I mean WEEP. It's crazy. 

The appointment system rolled out in major markets years ago. These were growing pains that all stores went through but he's experiencing them now.

Edit: *It's the new Apple roll out according to someone here. Not the general appointment roll out.* Above statement isn't applicable.

Store management almost always avoids Geek Squad. They want nothing to do with it and very rarely give anyone support. They have a supervisor but if he's having trouble or out of his element he is interpreting new material on his own. OP is likely being told ""DONT TAKE ANYONE WITH NO APPOINTMENT.""

An appointment is ""Encouraged, not required."" If someone walks in he gets put in a walk in queue.

Edit: *It's not really a literal walk in queue. The custom is a walk in. This is vs slotting them in for something relatively quick or potentially quick hours later. And yes, it's ""required"" to have an appointment. What I mean to say is use your heart and head to realize when you can help someone in-between. No one gets turned away.*

Most customers are totally happy to allow you to do a pick up for someone if you ask them. The customer with an appointment hasn't been waiting long, and he has dedicated time with you. He's very happy. He won't mind you doing something quick while booting the computer up. 

Just further context if anyone was actually curious how things worked.

I'm from Northern California. A few years ago I went to Boston on business. Never had been to Boston before. Just had the typical stereotype in my head. Suffice to say it wasn't all that positive. 

Anyway, first day there we had a few hours to blow. So, me and my travel companion go to check out some sites that are within walking distance of the hotel. It's about 5:00 in the afternoon. So the streets are fairly busy with either tourists (we were near the site of the Boston massacre) and/or commuters getting off work. 

I honestly don't know how it happened. I don't remember reaching in my front pocket--where I keep my wallet. But over the din of street noise I hear a ""HEY! HEY PAL!"" I turn and there's a guy rushing at me. Honestly, my first/gut reaction is I'm being attacked. ""HEY PAL, YA DRAWPT YA WAWLET!""

Oh my shit I've never been so grateful to anyone in my life. Unfortunately I don't carry cash (much like OP). But my hotel key, company and business credit cards, ID (important for getting back on the plane home) were all there. As far as I know, he didn't even open it to rifle through it. It all happened so quickly I think all he had time to do was pick it up and run it over to me. 

I offered him $20 if he wanted to follow me to an ATM. He turned that down so I offered him a cup of coffee. He turned that down. Having had to tell him I was just in from out of town and how he had just saved the trip for me he just told me to enjoy my stay.

141,"Gosh, this reminds me of the guy who rescued an elephant karma..

In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Northwestern University. On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it.

As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.

Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenage son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder.

The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

Probably wasn't the same elephant."

157,"Some little shit took gum out of a urinal in the Las Vegas airport and threw it at me, laughed then ran off. I could have pissed on him. I coulda threw him in a urinal. I could have done so much harm. He was by himself and like 5 years old tops. I was a hung over, drugged up 24 year old leaving Vegas.  But I just took a deep breath then went and found him and his family and in front of a decent amount of onlookers I was like is that your kid? What the hell is he doing in an airport restroom by himself.  You are all idiots! I explained what the stupid little shit did then told them it was just the 2 of us in the restroom and how if I were a bad man I could have done very bad things and that would be on them (the parents) for not watching him. Told them how idiotic they were all once more and walked away. The dad was turning red the whole time and when i left he absolutely exploded on the little kid who then started crying his little eyes out. I took my seat a little ways away and smiled and waved as the dad was yelling at the kid and pointing at me asking him to explain what he was thinking. Thay was a pretty intense roller coaster of being pissed off and then very satisfied.

Edit: one word  "
158,"To be fair, his wife was unpleasant first. If she doesn't understand that a young child might make an assumption that all big people are pregnant due to her own experience of her pregnant mother (I'm not saying she is fat in case it's coming across that way), then she has the problem. 

And calling your child a little shit, in front of the child who made a simple mistake, is calling for the parent to defend their child. 

But it sucks, I'm sorry it didn't work out for you. Hopefully he will calm down and let you back into his good books"

He seemed to know what was about to go down too. Just saying, if it was a one time thing, or a first time thing, I think shock and anger would have been the  result.

164,"Assault depending upon local laws is defined as a harmful touching. You were assaulted by this person when they threw the drink in your face. This is a unique case because the assault occurred while you were in control of a large piece of machinery. You acted in either self defense by slapping her, or you assaulted her after regaining control over a dangerous situation caused by her assaulting you. Either way with a good lawyer I cannot see this going her way. Charge her with assault with a deadly weapon (lawyer up, I don't know exactly how this work) for the assault while driving in hazardous conditions, and child endangerment. I wish you best of luck. "

181,"He first sees his mother’s breasts at the age of six. She leaves the bathroom door unlocked and he walks in on her. She is naked and pale and hairy. Her large breasts sag, her nipples are inflamed and inverted. There is a scar on her abdomen, evidence of his entrance into this world.

He begins to see her breasts everywhere. He sees them floating in the darkness before he falls asleep and he sees them again in his dreams. He tells no one of their presence, knows even at this young age to stay silent.

His mother’s breasts follow him throughout elementary school. They float, they jiggle, they attach themselves to walls and doors and other kids. They change with his mood. When he is angry they grow large and he is blinded not by rage but by his mother's breasts. When he cries they cry with him. When he is happy they bounce up and down and sometimes he does not know whether he is happy first, or if it is the bouncing that makes him happy.

A year passes. He peoples his world with his mother’s breasts. He deforms them uniquely to the individual. His second grade teacher is a single giant breast with an inverted nipple that teaches them social studies and multiplication and cursive. His classmates are breasts, asymmetric, tear-dropped, round, bell-shaped. It is as if within his mother’s breasts lie the breasts of all humanity. He is not sure whom he loves more. His mother or her breasts.

His mother is sick and in the hospital. One day she comes home with a flat chest. His parents try to explain but he does not listen. All he can think about is that his mother’s breasts are gone. He wonders where they went. He vows to find them and return them to her.

He looks for days but cannot find them, looks at everyone he meets but does not see them. And then one night he looks in the mirror and sees not himself but his mother’s breasts. He goes to his mother and hugs her and he will never let her go. He lives there now on her chest like a male anglerfish."
182,"My dad's old phone number was like, one off from the local Dominos. He got calls all the time for pizzas. One day, we were at a baseball game and drunk. He decided to fuck with some poor dude who called for a pizza. Took his order, sounded legit af, and said 20 mins or whatever. We thought he would figure it out. He calls back a few times, dad says on it's way. After like 2 hrs, dude calls livid. My dad apologized profusely and explained that (the imaginary) driver died in a crash on the way to deliver his pizza. He really laid it on thick...He was speeding due to the guys complaint, etc. 

He played it all the way through without breaking. Still one of my fav memories of my dad (died 4 years ago yesterday). "

Can we go back to the whole 'underaged' bit and then follow it up with the tracking (stalking) of IP addresses and round out with a bit of batshit crazy virus info hunting? Ling needs help and I mean that seriously. That's beyond scary and uncalled for. And OP maybe you need to talk with your parents BC it sounds like your heart might be in the right place but you need to always put your safety first. To up the scary you not only put yourself at risk but also your family. Ling doesn't seem to understand healthy boundaries and could have just as easily gone to your house and hurt not only you but people close to you.

215,"I can agree with this, I went through some rough shit about a week before 4th of July and like tradition, I get drunk with my friends, though this time I was wayyy too into it. I was consitently switching between a 5th of vodka I kept to myself and keg beer through the entire night, I was aware of how fucked I was but I didn't care, I kept going. I ended up outside on the front porch and felt the puke coming, this was the first time I had ever thrown up from drinking, and I've drank a lot in my lifetime, I honestly believe it was just the constant switching between vodka and nasty ass keg beer. I started throwing up thinking I was gonna be fine after it, I wasn't, I kept throwing up to the point where two of my friends and my cousin had to take my puke covered shirt off and give me glass after glass of water to help get it out of my system, as my one friend was quite experienced with vomiting and drinking. Without them I would have most likely died by choking on my own vomit.

TL;DR Drank too much, probably would have died if not for reliable, great friends"
216,"I was buying a knife from this huge shady looking mother fucker when i was sitting outside at lunch in high school once. Before we sealed the deal i asked ""Is it sharp"" to which he responded by stabbing my friend in the arm with it, i'm not talking about like a fatal thrust but he pierced skin and there was a trail of blood after my friend started running away. So i bought the knife. My friend told the school nurse he ""fell on a sharp rock"" in fear of actually being assaulted by this shady bastard."
217,"Is it not a kind if shitty thing to do to the guys too? 

I mean, they are in Tinder looking for relationships or whatever (the same as you were) and you're messing with them, wasting their time and it's just a big joke to you. "
218,"As a former delivery driver (with AWD and studded snow tires), I always looked forward to bad weather because I knew I'd make good sympathy tips. However, I'm a competent, responsible, and prepared person which I'd imagine accounts for about 5% of all drivers, so you probably have a good point there."
219,"Honestly he probably didn't ditch the coat, as a man who has been down on luck and in new jersey during winter I would have given anything for a stranger to give me the coat off of their back. I most likely would of been in a cold and miserable mood and probably muttered a thank like that fellow did, this is also most likely due to the fact that at that moment that man was not only felling but he was helpless and one does not like being in that position so most likely didn't want to make a big deal out of your kindness even tho it was a huge deal for him.

Also if you went back to him and said you left money in the coat and asked for 20-40 bucks back for gas and food he would definitely give it to you and probably an thank you that you deserved for you incredibly kind gesture. Not many people would literally give someone else in need the clothes off their backs, you are a true hero."
220,"I'm trying to put myself in her shoes because right now I'm thinking she has no sense of humor and is too serious.

So... You guys have chemistry, you hang out, she likes you. Then you match with her bestie. &lt;----oh okay. I see where you fucked up.  Maybe she doesn't use tinder anymore because she obviously really likes you and now she's pissed that you ARE using it. 

I have never used it (got married to my husband at the ripe old age of 24, before tinder was a thing) but I feel like if I had met my husband on an app and later found out he was still using the app, potentiality to, you know, *find other people to talk to* I would be *so* done. 

It probably has zero to do with you matching with a man and everything to do with you not only still using tinder, but matching with her bff who she probably gushes to about you and that is oh so embarrassing. ""Ohhh yes he's *so great*! I like him so much!"" and then BOOM you match with the bf4e. Ugh. I'm cringing for her.

They're both gigantic assholes who risked their kids lives and deserve punishment. He deserves what he got, and she should also be prosecuted for endangering the kids."
223,"Got drunk in highschool and TP'd my buddies neighbor (who also went to our highschool) with a group of about 10 guys and gals.

224,"**FULL VERSION BELOW BUT THIS ONE IS NICE TOO:**

Knees weak, Chinese guy sweaty

Tickets to Germany already

Mom's spaghetti 

On the surface he looks calm and girly

To catfish guys

But he keeps on forgetting

That he's a man and burly

Clocks run out 

Ling's on his way now

Blow

Theyre  married now

Edit- thanks for gold i'll write the lyrics (all of them)


**FULL VERSION:**

Look

If you had

One shot

Or one identity

To play a game as a girl

In two years

Would you catfish?

Or do it accidentally?

Yo

His character's a barby, 

His Knees weak, 

Chinese guy sweaty

Tickets to Germany already

Mom's spaghetti 

He's a guy, but on the surface he looks calm and girly

To catfish guys

But he keeps on forgetting

That he's a man and burly

He bonds with a guy so loud,

He fakes it proud, 

He hides his info now, the hard drives come out,

He says he's german but he's in netherlands how?

Clocks run out, 

Ling's on his way now,

Blaow

Theyre  married now

Oh there goes his identity, 

Oh Ling's upped the complexity

Oh there goes his sexuality

Ling's sad but he wont give up that easy? No

He's gunna have it, his lovers ass, he'll grope

It don't matter, his love, he knows that, and the law it's dope

He's gobsmacked but he knows, when he goes back to his apartment home, that's when it's 

Back to the internet again, yo this whole sharade

He better go and capture this dutch guy and hold onto him.

You better, not hide your identity, the moment

You join it, you better tell em all yo.

You get lots of shots but, You shouldn't pretend to be a hoe

Catfishing can happen accidentally, you better

You better, not hide your identity, the moment

You join it, you better tell em all yo.

You get unlimited shots but, You shouldn't pretend to be a hoe

His asshole is gaping, from the marriage he failed to be escaping

His dutch body is ling's for the taking

Make him queen as we all read the tifu's

An online life is interesting, but his white lie

he only dug deeper, only got closer

He comes clean it's all over, Ling's still on him

China to Germany he's known as the fake-persona

Ling's loaded, god only knows, Ling's closer to his home, He's a good hacker

Ling digging through but cant find a'

To get behold of all his information on his old SATA

his dad taught him so good, he has another hard drive

He's moved it away from his tower, he doesn't wanna get caught'a

Ling still wants op though, he's his lover

Ling can't move on, though, he books tickets to netherlanda

So the story is told and unfolds on tifu, I suppose it wont end happily but Ling moves on

Da da dumb op dumb da da

You better, not hide your identity, the moment

You join it, you better tell em all yo.

You get lots of shots but, You shouldn't pretend to be a hoe

Catfishing can happen accidentally, you better

You better, not hide your identity, the moment

You join it, you better tell em all yo.

You get unlimited shots but, You shouldn't pretend to be a hoe

He still games, and hasn't changed his ways

Tear Ling's heart out like a surgeon with a blade

He was just playing in the begining but he's deranged

Ling's chewed up spit out but he's changed

He didn't catch the plane, he's no commuter

He ceased contact and he's no longer a communicater

All the love inside died, and by the 

dutch guy and he can't get to

germanys airport cause man this dumb guy pretendign to be a hermaphrodite, lied

It's a tifu, there's no update from op

his life's not too bad and hes not guilty

and he probably wont even stop catfishing

Ling won't bother, between china and germany is a lot of kilometer

Ling's probably crying and screaming too much

For op to want to say or stop, catfishing another clam or not

lings gotten to a point, he's like a cornered rat he's got

To suicide or not, he would probably rather get shot

Dutch booty is his only option, China's not

Op he really loves you but your traits have got to go, you cannot keep catfishing 40 year olds. 

So here you go, let's hope ling's hot

airline tickets fail you not cause it's the only oppertunity ling's got

You better, not hide your identity, the moment

You join it, you better tell em all yo.

You get lots of shots but, You shouldn't pretend to be a hoe

Catfishing can happen accidentally, you better

You better, not hide your identity, the moment

You join it, you better tell em all yo.

You get unlimited shots but, You shouldn't pretend to be a hoe

You join it, you better tell em all yo.

You fall in love with people's minds man

239,"You need a lawyer mate. A good lawyer would argue that her actions were a reckless endangerment of a minor as well as assault on you. 

Although provocation doesn't totally absolve you of your reaction it could be argued that if she hadn't directly caused a heightened emotional state and put her families life in danger you wouldn't have reacted as you did. This would also look better if (and I hope) you have no prior issues with domestic abuse.

Best case scenario, you both drop charges, you get some marriage guidance to see if you can salvage it and shit gets back to normal.

Edit - general consensus seems to be skip the salvage operation and get a divorce lawyer. Just want to add I personally agree with this, I was just looking at a possible best case scenario (as we don't know whether there's a history of mental health issues etc which could explain the unstable and dangerous behaviour).

Edit two - don't know why I thought you were married.  Adjust divorce lawyer to (probably) messy breakup. In which case you're probably going to need a lawyer for any custody battle."

I have an ass tattoo that says ""Shake"" my best friend has ""Bake."" We lost a bet in college and we are men of our word. So here I am bleeding an insane amount of blood with a tattoo that says Shake haha.


My beautiful Finacee was with me otherwise it would have been really wierd"
275,"That sounds very traumatic for the guy who ""ordered""."
276,"Tell that guy I said ""fuck you!"""

If just getting undressed does this much damage, Lord only knows what kissing might make happen"

279,"&gt; Worst part is I had a drink with my friend before and forgot my toothbrush

Am I supposed to carry a toothbrush wherever I go?"
280,"Imagine reaching way, *way* up the skirt of her bridal gown, fiddling a few seconds, and flinging a corset overhead to the groomsmen. THEN you get to tell this little story."
281,Yep. She tried to take advantage of a drunken person for sex and got what she deserved. What OP did is actually a taught technique for stopping a rape.

285,I would believe you. :/ Societal gender role expectations are fucked and unrealistic
286,"Idk if this is TIFU but I have a homeless guy that comes to my house every couple weeks hoping to get cigarettes. It all started about a month and a half ago. I had just gotten back from work and was sitting in my car before I went inside. This old man id say in his 70s comes around my car and is the sweetest old man ever. He says he is so embarrassed but he was wondering if I could help him with couple bucks to get a bus pass and to go see his doctor the next morning. He was really humble about it and just kept saying he was so embarrassed. I didn't have any cash on me but I decided the guy was so nice I was going to him even better. I told him I didn't have any cash but offered him to go with me to the gas station and that I'd buy him some food and give him a couple bucks. So after giving him a ride over to the QT and then back to where he was staying for the night we parted ways. 
A couple weeks later he shows up at my house. He is saying something about going to court and that he was complimented by the attorney because they could tell he was a teacher. It was a proud moment for him and the only person he could thing to tell was me because I had been the only guy to be nice to him in the past month. After telling me he then went on to ask if he could write me a check for 25 bucks and I give him ten bucks back. It was a repayment of the 15 i had given him the last week and ten more so he could go buy a pack of cigarettes. I didn't have cash on me so and then just asked if he could buy couple cigarettes from me. I don't smoke so i politely told him i didnt smoke and I was already in for the night so I wasnt going to run and grab cash. I still felt bad for the guy because he was nice and I really fell for his situation. my girlfriend had just finished making a lasanga so we gave him some food and a bottle of water for the road. 
He showed up again about about three weeks ago offering to give her a fake earring he had found and a blanket as a thank you. I wasnt there so im not sure if he was asking for cigarettes or not. She was alittle scared without me home so she kept the door shut. 
The last time i saw him was about a week ago he came by again to see if he could again give me check for 15 bucks and I could give him cash to buy cigarattes. I told him again I didnt have cash and he asked if i smoked. I told him again I dont smoke and that I couldnt help him out again that day. He just asked for some milk if we could spare any. The last few times we talked he had mentioned that he had an ulcher and the milk really help calm the burning. I didnt have milk to give but i grabbed a couple bottle of water and sent him on his way. 

I guess the only TIFU is that I helped the guy out once and it happened to be in front of my house so he shows up every fews weeks and asks if I can give him cash to buy smokes. Im not to comfortable being his personal ATM and giving him cigarettes which definitely wont help him with the ulcer. I guess i will keep giving him food or water when he shows up because he has been nice and never gotten nasty with us. 


Edit: Wow! I want to let everyone know that I am aware he is trying to pull a scam. I can't blame the guy he is very elderly can barely talk and homeless.  He has a very bad lisp so i understand maybe half of what he says. He is  probably desperate to get by. I won't keep giving him money but I will talk to him and give him some water or food. Like I mentioned hes never been rude. He does sort of stand and talk as though hes working and angle on me. I won't stop him thinking hes pulling one over on me because then he may start asking for more. But at the most ive given was a bottle of water or filled his glass back up. I gave him some leftovers. I'm not a wealthy person but i have extra and kept in check i don't mind giving an old guy a little company and food to get by. "
287,He could try Fucking some hookers and show her pics 
288,"&gt; The particular location I work at is a test store for a new layout and process that works on an appointment basis. . . (side note, I was never told to breathe but I still need to.)

So, it's a brand new system only in place at select locations as a test run, and you're faulting the customer for not knowing how it works?

302,"This reminds me of a time when I was a broke student. 

I was walking into town in the middle of winter with a  great big hole in my shoe and clothes I wouldn't give to a charity shop (goodwill?) nowadays, with the intention of trying to find some kind of work. (parents broke due to job loss, everyone was struggling) 

I saw a woman drop an envelope about 5 meters ahead of me ,i picked it up and it must have had about 2 grand in cash inside it (it was already open) 

This was more cash than I'd ever seen in my life (I was 17)  and could easily have made a huge difference to me and my family. 

MamaTritonsSecret did not raise a theif. I shouted to this woman and run over to give her the money back. 

Did she give me a reward? Nope. 

Did she say thanks? Nope again. 

Did she look at me like a piece of shit and ask if I'd stolen any of the money then proceed to count it before walking off? Ding ding ding, we have a winner. "
