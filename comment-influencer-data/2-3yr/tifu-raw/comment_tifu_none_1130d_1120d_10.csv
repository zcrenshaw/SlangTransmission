You might be able to work things out with them, but don't sacrifice your happiness for theirs."

6,"800 pounds is insufficient for a human of normal body weight to climb on. Hence why it's not rated for climbing. 

If a human weighs 150 pounds, he/she can easily put more than 1000 pounds of dynamic weight on a system by simply bouncing around a bit. 

Most climbing gear is rated above 8KN (Around 2000 pounds) or in many cases much higher for this reason. Source:  am rock climber. "

Your family is betting that you will break first.. say fuck that and live exactly how you want to. They can accept you or they can lose the pleasure of having you in their life. Either way use this opportunity to travel and go the road less traveled. Either way you will end up on the other side of this with more experience and an awesome story.

11,"There's a quote from ~~Sigmund Freud~~ some person on Twitter (the quote is commonly misattributed, thank you for the correction) which I believe applies here:

&gt; Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure you are not, in fact, just surrounded by idiots.

Of course your situation is slightly different, but it really sounds to me like the people you've surrounded yourself with, parents included, are ignorant as hell. (And I realize a young person often has little choice in who they surround themselves with.) It sounds like this is your primary problem, above the narcolepsy/apnea.

She had outgrown it and it was in the corner of our dining room and had been for months. 

 So at 1AM or so I was getting water, and I hear a circus sounding song, but in extreme slow motion and off tone, start playing from the darkness.  My lizard brain is convinced a deranged clown is about to come out of the shadows and I may have let out a little shreik.  Instead, our cat came  sashaying out of the darkness and went to the other room.  I swear that animal set me up."

If it turns out it's not yours, she will get in a lot of fucking trouble. (Make sure to save these messages somewhere without her number being blacked out) If it is yours, own up to it. You're going to be paying child's support regardless, why pay her to ""keep quiet""? Not to mention your patents will figure it out eventually, when you recieve notification that you're being taken to court to establish child support. And if she is saying she wants 50k for an abortion, it sounds like she already knows it's not yours and she's trapping you purposely. So abortion isn't really an option either way, she would most likely keep the 50k and the kid, and still file for child support denying you every paid anything.( remember to keep the messages) Plus the bank won't just let you withdraw 50k without asking questions. If it's not your own personal standalone account, your parents will be notified."

109,"I'm a criminal defense attorney, and I've handled loads of these sort of cases.  I'm not sure where you live, but in our jurisdiction, the prosecutor would have charged this guy with Assault based on your statement alone.  The victim wouldn't need to ask for the case to go forward, or even cooperate in the case.  That said, it sounds like you may have been summonsed for a trial, but even then, a witness shouldn't need to be there for a trial to start.  Typically, witnesses aren't called to testify for a few hours after the trial begins, at the earliest.  I'm not necessarily crying foul since this is obviously a court system I'm not familiar with, but the whole procedure seems very odd to me.  If you want to PM me where this occurred I would like to know.     

Edit:  After PMing with the OP, my guess is that this is a way for the prosecutor to cull through the cases that he/she expects to go to trial, and those that should be dumped:  if the witnesses keep showing up for pretrial hearings, then the case must be worth taking to trial.  That's a pretty crappy way to pursue justice, but it's equally crappy to just charge everything, make the defendant wait months for a trial, and then dump it the day of the trial because the state can't prove its case for lack of witnesses (which is what happens in my jurisdiction all. the. time).

and for the love of god, if she doesn't know/remember what happened and thinks you are some great guy that just came to her safety when she fell...*tell her the truth*. this isn't a zanny sit-com, don't try to play it off or turn it back around. be upfront and honest 'im responsible for doing this to you, it was an accident, i was awkwardly trying to start a conversation in what i thought was a cute kind of way and you slipped, i shouldn't have done it, it was silly and stupid and really just intrusive and turned out pretty dangerously. i am very sorry.' apologize and mean it, mean it for her sake and her sake only, don't try to make this an opportunity to try to get her to like you again. you have to accept that by all reasonable expectations that ship has sailed so long ago that it's now well beyond the horizon and completely out of sight.

in the future, it sounds stupid, but just try ""hello"" for an opening line and go from there. don't try to craft a perfect little cute moment, they don't exist. if they did, it's basically passive aggressive coercion, you're very subtly trying to get them to believe a false pretense skewed to your benefit. your goal should just be a good conversation with maybe one or two moments of light flirting to make your intentions known, anything beyond that is a bonus and not an obligation. you would be surprised how much a good conversation can make someone want to be around you more. 

i think the crux of the problem with the 'all according to plan' mentality is that there is an assumption that after this first meeting you'll have started dating or at the very least are going to hook up in some way. i can assure you, this is so unlikely to happen in the first conversation it's safe just to say that it won't, period...and if it does, than that's not the kind of woman you need contrived circumstances to get to know, ask that kind of woman for what you want and she's likely to just give it to you.

I don't think we realize how much pressure is put on Men to initiate. It's really stressful. The few times I've asked someone out, made me realize how stressful it must be for Men to have that expectation put on them all the time.

And given how things are changing, I would think a lot of Men would be afraid of offending women. Try to ask a girl out, and you are being a misognyst for bothering a woman when she's just trying to go outside. I know context matters (like where and when you ask someone out), but regardless I can understand why Men are afraid to just ask.

I'm so glad that society doesn't expect us to initiate. That said, obviously OPs idea was truly horrible (if it's even true). Why would anyone think it's a good idea to come into physical contact with a stranger?"

#2: Even if she IS pregnant, do not sign any piece of paper or say to her in any form that you are the father. She may have been pregnant already when she fucked you, and was looking for a source of money. Even if she IS pregnant, you may not be the father.

Chill out and wait for the medical facts. If she is not pregnant, you are safe. Insist to talk to the doctor with her, if she will not let you. You know that she is not pregnant. Even if she is, insist on a paternity test. This is your right. If it is yours, then you have to deal with it. If no, you are safe.

Being creative and intelligent we found a solution to the problem. I knew some people selling festival chairs and the chairs arrived wrapped in thick layers of black plastic. So we took all that we could carry and wrapped our tent in even thicker layers of black plastic(since it was cut open from the chairs we had to put a lot).

DO NOT tell her at this point that it was on purpose.

And for the love of god, give up on dating this girl. 

From the perspective of a woman, the thing you can do to sour this further and make her actively dislike someone who accidentally hurt her, is trying to get something out of the accident. Sounds like she's a pretty girl. Trust me. She will see it and recognize it if you're using this incident to lay the mack on. Does the sentence ""That guy came to the hospital brought me flowers just so he could hit on me, after he put me there in the first place"" sound like a positive one? That will not go well for you. And that is with the assumption that it was a genuine accident.

Just go and be sorry you seriously injured someone who didn't do anything at all, and leave it at that.

Also, god help you if she has some sort of permanent damage from this, and your post was this popular on reddit.  I wouldn't be surprised if someone from the wedding saw this, at this point.

278,"Probably late to the party, but having 3 kids myself, and 20+ years of menstrual cycles, I kinda understand how this works. If you had sex a month and a half ago, and the tests are showing up negative, it's probably not yours. Those tests from the grocery store are very sensitive and can read a result sometimes up to 7 days before a missed period. A period happens about 2 weeks after ovulation, so she should have missed her period 4 weeks ago and it would definitely (barring some crazy biological phenomena) show up on the test. 

TL;dr - it's probably not yours. 

Edit to add: there is always the possibility that she's not pregnant. The above info was for if she is. If she waits a week and had another test, probably not pregnant. 

Thinking over your situation, if it were me, and she is pregnant, I would tell her I'd need a paternity test to give her child support. And i won't have an income if my parents cut me off, so it's in her best interests to stfu. If you both want an abortion, you should help pay for it, but I would never pressure her into one.

285,"Exactly.  At a young age, OP has figured out things that take some people a lifetime.  On top of not accruing college debt in a futile attempt to bulldoze through the problem.  You have a decent job and a future to look forward to.  Don't look at the past with regret, you can't change that.  Look at the future with excitement.  "
286,A bum deal.
287,"The difference, of course, is that the pipes in the tobacco shop actually work for both their claimed and intended purpose. This hook is a prop. It is a toy."
288,"I once asked an old lady at a campground for a cigarette. I was probably 14 at the time. She told me she couldn't in good conscience contribute to someone of my age smoking. So I explained to her that I wasn't intending to smoke it, rather I was  trying to create a timed ""fuse"" so I could basically start a fire remotely (something I'd probably seen on MacGyver or A-Team). Her whole attitude changed and she was almost like, ""Well geez why didn't you say so in the first place??"" She asked no follow-up questions. Ended up giving me a few cigs because I would certainly have to do a couple of tests first to see how many minutes it took for a cig to burn down to the right spot. Times sure were different back then. I smoked the extras."
289,"Plus alcohol.

290,Because maybe nobody actually thinks of vulvas when they see that word used pejoratively.
291,"I don't think it's ""today I fucked up"" I think it's ""today those who were supposed to take care of me fucked up"". Don't be so hard on yourself, you did the best you could in the situation you were in. "
292,be sure to mention the exact reason as to why you've determined it's a bad product
293,Yea what are the chances that they'd know it was that specific bump skull-breaking incident he's referring to? Must be hundreds of those each day.
294,"Random question.  In the US, late 90's and early 2000's,  being 23 and living at home wasn't bad, but was on the edge of needing to wrap up your 'adolescence' and move out on your own.   

However, it sounds like living at home until much older is perfectly acceptable now.  Is this a European thing that's been like that for awhile?   Or is this the new norm across the world after the 07-08 global depression blew up younger people's chances of being able to afford rent/home ownership at a reasonable age?"
295,"Just by reading the text messages you two were sending back and forth on imgur, it's blatantly apparent that this girl is just that; a girl. She seems uneducated, lazy and willing to do most anything to make easy money because I'm sure she's not in a very good financial place at her minimum wage job(if she even has one) 

People decide that condoms aren't a necessity when there's all ready a concrete foundation to the possibility of a relationship. Yes, sometimes both parties can be drunk and decide that in the moment it's a ""good"" idea, but most women I've been with, sloshed or not, have generally always respected their bodies enough to remember the condom even when I didn't think twice about it because I was intoxicated.

She's trying to play this criminal mastermind game with you but at an elementary level. She's watched too many episodes of law and order SVU and thinks she knows how to work the system.

Recall the date you slept together and the date she thinks she became pregnant. Take her to the gyno and get the test done to make sure. Ask her if she's slept with anyone else, in front of the Doctor. That added pressure of authority could break her away from telling any kind of lie. 

Don't give her a single dime until the baby, if there is one, is medically determined that it's yours. She's quick to point out that you have a rich father, which makes me believe what I said above. She's just trying to play you for money. Maybe you appear weak. Maybe she has such an overly high opinion of herself that ""any guy"" would be lucky to fuck her, but she's sorely wrong. 

Gold digger for sure.

Get a lawyer. "
296,Or even asked some of his old friends if they knew the phone number 
297,Was thinking the same thing... Ginormous asshat. 
298,"European here. We are not.    
We just pretend to be kind. "
299,"Honestly, sounds like your brother is a little bitch boy who's hurt he got rejected.

Outed or not, he could have just asked you about it first because telling everyone about it."
300,"That's not normal. D: You forgot the context for the ""getting into cars with strange men"" too."
