0,"Back in the '70s, my dad (a biologist) was working with a guy who studied this tapeworm that can eat up a deer's brain (it was killing the population he was trying to study), and a human's brain, just as easily.  He (the other guy, not my dad) accidentally poked his own finger with a primed syringe full of lethal tapeworm, quite possibly putting a 12-18 month cap on his lifespan.  From the next room, my dad heard ""Fuck!  YYYEAAAAAGHHH!!!"" and then the sound of shattering glass.  Dude grabbed a scalpel, sliced his own finger open down to the bone, and dunked it in rubbing alcohol, killing any tapeworms that might've made it into his system before his circulation could send them to his brain.  He passed out from the pain and broke the beaker of alcohol, and obviously needed a trip to the ER for stitches, but he survived the experience.

**EDIT:** Some have asked what the tapeworm was, so I emailed Dad, and he said:

&gt; It was either Echinococcus granulosis or Echinococcus multilocularis.  The correct names could have been changed by the Taxonomy Politburo since then. It's only been half a century.

I don't know what that means, and it may imply that I've gotten some details of this story wrong.  If so, I apologize; I just recalled it from memory as best I could."

12,"I read a book about some rabies researchers who had several rabid monkeys in their lab.   They literally kept a pistol in the lab to use on themselves if they should get bitten.

\*edit:  Not just ""some researchers"", but Louis Fucking Pasteur

&gt; In the late nineteenth century, Louis Pasteur's laboratory assistants made sure to always have a loaded gun on hand. Their boss, who was already famous for his revolutionary work on food safety, had turned his attention to rabies. Since the infectious agent—later identified as a virus—was too small to be isolated at the time, the only way to study the disease was to keep a steady of supply of infected animals in the basement of the Parisian lab. As part of their research, Pasteur and his assistants routinely pinned down rabid dogs and collected vials of their foamy saliva. The risk of losing control of these animals loomed large, but the bullets in the revolver weren't intended for the dogs. Rather, if one of the assistants was bitten, his colleagues were under orders to shoot him in the head.

You're an executive, so you have experience managing people. If this truly was a FU, he would have mentioned it to you quietly after the meeting or brought it up some other way. Instead he chose to show it to the entire company, all at the same time, while laughing - he just found it amusing and correctly assumed the rest of the company found it amusing.

Regarding the lapse in concentration you're afraid it may show, many others here have said that it's normal for a human to be unable to focus indefinitely. He knew what he was doing - he literally stopped the entire meeting and he used your sword to add levity to the entire meeting, and give everyone's brain a break, that was no accident. If he was truly concerned about your sword drawing, he would have asked you a simple question just to bring you back to reality without focusing on your sword.

Another capful; still nothing. Bubbles must be broke, so we hit FUCK IT and poured in the majority of the HALF GALLON BOTTLE we got at the dollar store. About 45 minutes later all holy bubbling hell broke loose.

Que two teenage girls frantically scooping up armfuls of bubbles with towels and dashing around all-panic stricken and searching for ways to dispose of the mess... Filling bathtubs, sinks, throwing armfuls out open windows, off the deck... We fought the bubbles with no solid plan and a buttload of adrenaline until roughly 3am when we finally gave up. The jet tub was in the basement of this vacation rental, so eventually we just shut the door to the basement and went to bed.

Opened the door to the basement in the morning to a WALL of bubbles. We quite literally filled the basement with foam.

Her family was not pleased, but we scraped up the money to pay for damages. I wasn't invited on any more family vacations."

164,"3 reasons you're not going to die:

1) Bleeding is a natural reaction clearing out intruding particles - your cancer cells have probably been swept out by your first drop of blood.
Furthermore, in the upper layers of your skin, there is a heck-lot of immune cells specifically produced to catch intruding particles. Even if they make it into your venous system - again unlikely - phagocytic cells should catch them before they make it into the arterial system and capillary system of the bone marrow - what would be quite some travel to go unnoticed. The immune system has an incredible amount of ways in which to detect and destroy cancer cells.
As for needle-stick injuries in general some statistics from virology: Healthcare professionals often have needle-stick injuries from patients contaminated with highly infectious viruses such as AIDS or Hepatitis B or C. However rates of actually transmitting these diseases are quite low. 
1.5 - 3 % for Hepatitis C; 30 % for Hepatitis B; 0,3 % for HIV.
So the chances of cancer cells actually getting into and staying in your bloodstream should be quite low.

2) As far as I know spreading of cancer cells is linked to certain binding factors, alterations in these binding factors normally only occur in later stages. So chances are quite high that even if cells enter your bloodstream and don't get destroyed by your immune, the specific binding factor(s) for _your_ bone marrow is missing. That's a shot in the dark truly, because your subtype of your cancer cell would be important to evaluate that but chances are in your favour big time.

3) Lymphatic cells have a very high reproduction rate, so the natural occurrence of cancerous cells is quite high by itself. Your body however, should be well capable of destroying cancerous cells. Even if you should develop ALL - highly unlikely as I stated above - ALL should be very well treatable. Depending on your age and subtype survival rates, which are now mostly considered as ""healed"" are well over 3/4 and in some studies even over 90 %. New treatments are develloped every month basically. By people doing science - not injuring themselves with needles - sorry just joking.

So - Needle stick injuries happen quite often... Seldomly people die ;) You will not. But the check ups will be a pain in the ass ;)"

166,"Tetanus has nothing to do with rust, it's a bacteria, the reason that it got associated with rust is from farm workers. What do you find a lot of on farms? Animal shit full of bacteria. What else do you find? Rusty objects that have been plowed through animal shit. That's how misinformation is born."
167,"In case you're not a masochist, here's OP's story with paragraphs:

&gt;In concordance with the chief majority of cardinal Fuck-Ups, my story originates at the bar. I was with my best buddy doing a our regular Friday routine which consists of the usual bar-crawling, skirt chasing debauchery. Nothing unusual there. So, 2:00am eventually rolls around, and me not about to go down so easily bought two package bottles of Chivas. 

&gt;After settling accounts, (a few not-so-cheap bar tabs later) it is ascertained that there are no late night party pursuits or after-parties presenting themselves so I figured things were done for the night. 

&gt;I call my Uber back to our place and my roommate Sebastion and I jump in and head back with my plunder. I know its implied but it's important to state that we are stridently hammered. We walking inside our apartment, he walks in first and I close the door behind me. 

&gt;As I 180' after fastening the lock he's standing there with two things. A TREMENDOUS bag of cocaine and the biggest shit eating grin on his face I've ever seen. We proceed to indulge. Fast forwarding a bit. We're blowing lines bouncing off the walls and at this point its about 4:30am. I've been drinking neat all night but somehow I formulated a rational thought and decided it was time to switch to drinking on the rocks for a little hydration. 

&gt;As i reach my refrigerator to get ice from the door, my eyes slowly panned up my fridge an feast my eyes upon the glorious watermelon perched atop of it that I had purchased about a week prior. I don't know why, but I was immediately beset with an overwhelming urge to destroy it. Could have been the Mythbusters I was watching earlier. Could have been the near-lethal dose of cocaine in my system. 

&gt;Irrelevant. I knew what I had to do. I yell at Sebastion to saddle the fuck up because shenanigans were about to ensue in full force. I call another Uber. He arrives and I not-so-eloquently (but not impolitely) request transportation downtown as I get into his car clutching a watermelon at 4:30 in the morning. 

&gt;I chose this destination for its ideal topography. I wanna huck this thing off of the the highest goddamn thing I can find. Tall buildings. Bingo. 

&gt;In transit we pass a 24 hour Walmart. Recognizing this stroke of good luck, I shout ""STOP! PULL IN HERE."" at my poor Uber driver. Eager to capitalize on our good fortune, we run inside giggling like little girls while he waits in the parking lot. I need more melons. I didn't want them. I NEEDED them. I filled up my cart with about 15 and then rolled the rest of the melons behind the cart while Sebastion pushed it while dumbfounded employees stare, but don't intervene. (I checked my transaction history the next day. $124 fucking dollars.) 

&gt;So, we get back to the parking lot and begin to load up nearly two dozen WATERMELONS into his car. The guy, the guy was mortified. I've never seen somebody look so uncomfortable. I was the captain then. I could smell the fear on him. 

&gt;So, again fast forwarding a couple minutes; I realize there's no way I'm getting on top of a bank or apartment complex at this hour, so I direct our nearly petrified chauffeur to the first parking garage I can think. The one for the surrounding area of the restaurant that Sebastion's works at. 

&gt;We asked him to drive to the top floor but the driver mustered the courage to draw the line there and let us out there. 

&gt;We agreed. 

&gt;We debarked by loading our melons on the curb, sans the one we let him for a tip. We rolled them into the elevator about 20 yards away, which was was extremely convenient. 

&gt;Fortune was truly in our favor. So far at least.... We get to the top floor shotgun a couple o' beers and begin systematically destroying every single melon one by one. 50' blast marks in the alleyway, staircase, etc. 

&gt;ALL ON CAMERA. AT HIS PLACE OF BUSINESS. 

&gt;He got fired, We've both been charged with trespassing and littering. Altogether that one night cost me about a thousand dollars and my room mate and best friend's job. Not to mention, can never get an Uber ever again. Reddit, I believe I havee sincerely fucked up.

I remember a post on the new section of that subreddit, of a self-made business man who has been smoking weed since he was 17. He was 50 or so when he made the post. Suddenly, this man's wife of 15 years started making snarky comments about his habit. They instantly accused him of being a drug addict and telling him to quit and seek help. That she has grown to and he had failed to do so and that everything was his fault. Instead of listening to the opinions of the guy who was married to this woman for 15 years and, oh I don't know, might have known her a bit - they got downright *nasty.* Once the addict word got thrown around a bit, the guy started to get less accommodating (understandably, imo).

The guy updates that he wife was just envious of his lifestyle and ability to peruse his use (she was being drug-tested) and didn't know how to express her feelings so she turned bitter for a few weeks and deeply regretted it. She felt as thought she had to work and contribute something so that she could feel equal. He assured her that his money is *their* money and that he loved her so much he couldn't care less if she was working. She quit her high-stress job so her loving husband could support her dreams of pursuing art. He said they were smoking a bowl that night and that all the d-bags could suck it.
