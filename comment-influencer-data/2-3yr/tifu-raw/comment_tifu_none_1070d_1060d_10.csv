10,"Not to hijack the thread, but I too had an encounter with a ""Matt"" (not his real name).  I was working for a tech company in NJ, when this man about 50 applied for a position.  He was impeccably credentialed.  Graduated tops in his class from Princeton with MS and PhD from MIT.  Chair of this RFC committee, contributor to that tech project.  The works.  And his hair was perfect.  Thick luxurious silver, with no split ends, swept back from his brow like waves of pure intellect.  The whipped cream on the Matt parfait was his voice, though.  It was this deep resonating grumble that spoke of love and authority.  If the phrase ""titty sprinkles"" had existed at the time, Morgan Freeman would have relinquished claim to it and bowed to the new master of silk.  
We hired him lickety split.  If nothing else, the lady clients would make sure he stayed 100% billable (and then some).  
Around the same time, our company had this employee-empowerment initiative, part of which was that we got to write our own job description and pick our own title.  Matt picked ""Chief Scientist""- and they let him.  He even put it on his business cards.  
But things did not go as well all might have hoped.  Reports started coming in.  Matt had argued with clients on technical points and had usually been wrong (or if right, then only technically right and his solutions were outside of well-known best practices).  I started getting sent along on client calls with him, and it was really weird.  He would speak in paragraphs that were oddly familiar and propose solutions to problems other than the ones stated by the clients- but it was if I'd heard those solutions before.  I kept having to interrupt and say things like ""Well, what I *think* Matt is proposing is to start with this solution and build on it like this...""  
One day, I was in Matt's office (a corner overlooking the pond, natch) and noticed a set of books in his book case.  They were all from a suggested reading list I had put together for junior consultants.  Brand new, with a couple even still in the plastic wrappers from the nearby University book store.  I realized months later that everything he had said or proposed had come almost verbatim from exercises and explanations in those books.  Even one that I had been the author of, which was why I had experienced a sort of deja-vu at the time (I'd barely remembered writing the thing- it had been in my early post-academic career).  
Things snowballed.  Matt got kicked out of one client site for being absolutely horribly wrong and costing them tens of thousands of dollars in wasted hours and equipment purchases.  Then he got kicked out of another for a huge blowout argument with the client's tech director.  Matt had said something stupid and then doubled-down when he got called on it.  He slammed the door on his way out and returned with a text book (not mine, thankfully) showing how his statement had been correct.  Except that it was pure theory, and the equipment he was working on did not implement that aspect of the protocol.  Which he should have known- our company made that equipment, after all.  
One or two more incidents like that, and I got highly suspicious.  For some reason, it bothered me that someone with a PhD could possibly be that ignorant.  It was like he was a day 1 student at Uni- a brilliant one, but not nearly ready to graduate.  So I had HR call up Princeton.  And to our amazement, not only had they never had someone of that name graduate, they didn't even offer the major he claimed at the time he said he was there!  Neither of his graduate degrees were real either.  And the industry groups and standards organizations he claimed to be members of him did not list him anywhere on their directories.  Nor could I find any reference to any publication by him, despite his claims to be an ""extremely well-published author.""  
(I should note here that I had not been involved in hiring Matt.  HR was very monolithic at our company, and they did all the hiring with minimal input other than job specs.  Come to think of it- If nothing else, Matt could have added ""responsible for changing hiring practices at a major company"" to his resume.  We always checked credentials after that, and tech-screens became mandatory.)  
Anyway, the house of cards tumbled.  He was called in and asked point-blank if he really had the credentials he claimed to.  He broke down, sobbing, and admitted that he did not.  He'd made the whole thing up.  He'd had some rudimentary classwork and some OJT at a previous employer and tried to parley that into a full-on consultant gig.  And it hadn't worked.  We gave him a cardboard box to collect his personal things and walked him out the door.  And that was the last we heard of Matt the Chief Scientist.  
Or so we thought - There are two weird codas to this story:  
The first involves a failed project.  We had tried to start up a hardware and service platform that would allow physicians to do telemedicine with housebound patients.  The patient would get a suite of equipment (digital scale, video phone, blood pressure, pulse O2 monitors, etc.) and a T1 line installed in their home.  The physician would get a console that accessed the data from the monitors.  The physician could consult with the patient via video phone, view x-rays, see data, etc. and issue commands to a platoon of at-need nurses.  It was what would (three decades later) become ""the medical cloud.""  Very ahead of its time, though.  It failed because the technical infrastructure simply didn't exist and/or was too expensive.  But our illustrious leaders had been SURE that this would be the ""next big thing,"" and they'd made it the baby of their Chief Scientist (who had no idea what to do with it or how to pitch it).  So we had a small warehouse full of diagnostic and monitoring equipment that none of the others of us had seen and we all kind of forgot about because our lead guy had been kicked out of the company.  
Well six months or so later, someone had a light bulb go off over his head and said ""hey! didn't we have a warehouse full of diagnostic and monitoring equipment somewhere?""  And so we spent a couple of weeks tracking it down- seems we'd even forgotten where it *was.*  I got stuck going through Accounts Payable records, and found a huge bill for warehouse and office space at an address nobody recognized (Matt could also list ""responsible for increasing accountability to AR processes"" on his resume).  So I and a few others drove down there.  It took some wrangling with the landlord and a locksmith, but we eventually got in.  What we found was astounding- a showroom FULL of medical diagnostic equipment with nobody anywhere to be seen.  It was all brand new cutting-edge stuff, all uncrated, and arranged in what looked like a mock hospital ward.  The name on the corporate directory was ""Matt Diagnostics"" (note: not the real name, since he's not really a ""Matt."").  
The storage facility was in the same building, in a small attached warehouse.  Or the showroom was the ""front office"" of the warehouse might be a better way to put it.  Anyway, it was practically empty.  It looked like it had been chock-full of stuff at one point, but there were only random bits and pieces of tech lying about.  Exactly how much would take months of investigation by a platoon of accountants.  It turned out that Chief Scientist Matt had gone into business for himself, selling high-tech cutting edge diagnostic equipment to hospitals and physicians and taking orders (and prepayments) for millions of dollars more.  He'd netted close to a quarter-mil and then disappeared, leaving behind only bills and arrest warrants.  And that's the last we heard of of Matt the Chief Scientist.  
Or so we thought... Except that there's more:  
The second coda to this story is even stranger.  About two years later, one of my co-workers burst into my office yelling ""Dr. Matt's been arrested!  It's in the paper!""  Sure enough, right there on the front page was a story with a picture of our perfectly-coifed Chief Scientist.  The Silver Fox himself.  He'd apparently burned down his apartment building to claim his renter's insurance.  Why he needed a couple of grand in insurance fraud money was a mystery to us- had he managed to burn through all that cash in such a short time?  And why hadn't the cops arrested him before?  He was at the SAME DAMN ADDRESS we'd sent his paychecks to, for fuck's sake!  The only thing we did know was how he got nabbed for the fraud.  It seems that just prior to setting his four story apartment complex on fire, he had taken all of his personal belongings and piled them in a rented moving truck.  Then he sat in the truck and watched the building burn.  When the fire trucks got there, he got out of his truck, walked casually over, and asked the fire chief how soon he could have a report so he could file for the insurance claim.  The chief noticed all the stuff piled in the truck and asked how he'd moved his stuff out so conveniently prior to the fire starting.  Busted.  The chief was quoted as saying ""I've never had an arsonist ask me how to file an insurance claim before we started putting his fire out.""  He was arrested on the spot for the arson, and the papers stated that he also had several other warrants out on him.  Presumably at least one was for the theft of our equipment and subsequent fraud.  I never found out, though.  
And that's all I know about Matt the Chief Scientist.  For real this time."

115,"Combat does next to nothing now and neither does Raid. If you prefer to go the gel bait route, I whole-heartedly suggest you use Advion Cockroach Gel Bait. It kills up to 5 generations.

I had an absolutely terrible infestation from moving into a cheap trailer 40+ years old. Had nests of them. They would run across the floor in broad daylight. Even the exterminator told me we'd never get rid of them in this house and our best bet would be to try and control the population with monthly spraying and setting out glue traps regularly throughout the house. Basically milking us for $50 every month.

I refused to accept his answer and went online. Found advion and gentrol. I will add a link for them on Amazon. Basically the Advion is commercial/food grade gel for whole apartment buildings, hotels and restaurants. Use it just like combat. I will advise putting it out away from cats as it's toxic to them. It is technically safe for kids but would cause diarrhea and upset stomach. 

They FLOCK to it. Don't be surprised if you apply it and it's gone within 20 minutes. They have just enough time to make it to wherever they are building their nest, then they die. Roaches are cannibals so the others will eat the dead one. The bait will continue to work for up to 5 cycles of cannibalism. 

Along with that, use the gentrol IGR stations. They are basically roach birth control. You stick them in various places, break the tube containing the product and it works up to 75sqft. Any roach that walks in that 75sqft area will be rendered sterile. These stations last for 3 months.

The 2 methods used together will 100% eradicate your pest problem. It make take a few weeks to a month but it WILL work and you'll have a massive, rapid die-off in the first week.

131,"A douchebag in law school did just that. Turned in his cheat sheet with his bluebook. To make it worse, he lied, said it was a ""study guide"" that he did not at all refer to during the exam but had folded and left in his back pocket and inadvertently emptied his pockets in turning in his ""unused"" cheat sheet.

It gets better.  From the first day of law school, he got a doctor's note that he had severe ADD and could not take exams with the rest of the class and required his own private room.  His ADD was in fact SO bad that he could not even have a window to the room, and a proctor could not be in the room, or even check in from time to time. All that was allowed was a knock on the door 5 minutes before time for the test was up.

Up until the middle of the third and last year, he was one of the top 10 in the class and none of us could figure out why, because in class and in general he sounded like a complete moron.

He only got caught during our final year of law school.  As I said, due to his lies, he managed to hold a top 10 spot out of several hundred students.  He got offered jobs, grants, projects and other wonderful career opportunities that he not only did not deserve, but stole from the person in, say, spot #11 who did not have to cheat to get there.

So, he was suspended for a semester, lost the 20k for that year, had to repeat a bunch of classes, and his ""honors"" grades and status and ""top ten % standing"" was permanently wiped from his record.  All of this was reported to the state bar.

I happened to be working at a small firm and in came his resume via fax after his suspension started (yes, I'm old, get off my lawn).  I knew the story, saw his name on the resume, and that MOTHERFUCKER WROTE ON HIS RESUME HOW HE WAS TOP 10% AND AN HONOR STUDENT, AND RECIPIENT OF AWARDS and really, I'm not still annoyed as his total lack of remorse.

I called him as I was in charge of interviews, and has he did not recognize my voice, nicely ""interviewed"" him.  He told me his schedule was very ""free"" as he was only taking ""night classes"".  I told him I was impressed with his class standing and he confirmed with false modesty how hard he studied.  I then reported the entire matter (along with resume claiming to be honors/top ten when the school wiped that off his record) in to the dean of the school to prove that this shit clearly did not learn his lesson.

Matt, you sack of shit, if you are reading this, I hope you realize how much the class hated you.  If you fessed up, you could've saved yourself. Instead, you had zero remorse and kept at it, and lied and stole away the many benefits that the person who deserved that top 10 spot and other awards would have received if not for your lies.

OP: I'm not saying you are like him - he lied in the worst ways for years.  I'm not getting into a debate w/others of what makes one better or worse. Just saying you are one lucky mofo'.  I was sweating bullets just reading your story.

She had just breaded and fried some pheasant for us, and it tasted super strange and sweet, so we asked her where she had gotten the flour from. She goes to a cabinet and shows us. Turns out she had used vanilla protein powder instead of flour. My dad still ate the protein powdered pheasant. "
175,"Happened to me with an allergy pill once in college. I used to commute from my grandma's and had my own bedroom there. I used to keep Tylenol, allergy meds and various other stuff on a lazy Susan next to my bed so I could just spin it around and grab what I wanted while I was getting ready. Well I have an 8am class the one semester and instead of a vitamin I end up grabbing one of those 4hr allergy pills, but they were the drowsy type I'd take before bed if necessary. 

So it really didn't kick in until I got to school. I'm sitting there nodding off trying to stay awake. My first and second class were in the same room. So I'm drifting off and I'm like worst case I wake up in the next class.

Well I wake up. No one is in the room. Clock says 12:30 or something. I'm thinking there is no possible way. I check for my phone and don't have it (turns out I left it in the car, but initially I thought someone stole it). It's a windowless room so I couldn't just guess the time of day looking outside.

So I get up and go in the hallway and there is pretty much no one around. I go downstairs and go outside but it still looks early which is weird. Confused I go across to a different building to get a coffee from Tim Hortons to fully wake myself back up, there really aren't many people around so I know it's during class time.

I get over to the other building get my coffee and go check these big flat screen TVs they have that are always tuned to CNBC. 

Turns out it's 8:45. I hadn't even missed my 9 o'clock class. I later found out from someone the professor dismissed the class at 8:25 due to some meeting he had and I must have just woke up after a few minutes because I no longer heard anyone talking. Turns out the clock was broken. It just stayed at 12:30."

204,"Hi, reporting for my Matt story (he was a Mike, but whatever).

So mine was a cheater in PA (physician assistant) school.  The worst part is that the faculty really didn't try to do much about it.  He was seen and reported by students using cheat sheets and blatantly looking at others papers during exams.  Several reports led to the faculty giving him a designated spot to take exams in the front row, far left seat (everyone else was randomized for each test).

So one orthopedics exam, I see him with his phone out under his exam paper, clearly looking up at the proctor (who is bored, texting, not paying attention, whatever) and then using his phone.  So he's clearly cheating, and those who finished early continued to watch him do this from outside the class.  Someone went and grabbed the director of the program and a professor.  The both of them stood at opposite doors of the class, and saw him doing this.  The director pulls him into her office after the test, clearly angry at the fact.  Justice! No.

A week later...mother fucker Matt is still in our class! We had a practical that week involving a physical exam on another student that is monitored by a professor to grade.  The professor is supposed to just sit there, grade, and that's all.  The student who was Matt's partner said the professor fucking walked Matt through the whole damn thing when he would forget the next step, would remind him of things he missed, etc.

Matt, despite cheating his way through undergrad and grad program, eventually failed out.  Turns out, the brand new $40M library that was built had contributions and donors from alumni, a large LARGE donation coming from Matt's parents.

We never really got to the bottom of it all.  But Matt was just an entitled asshole who thought he could get away with anything.  Bonus story: I caught him parking (his very nice Mercedes) handicapped at the gym once and when I asked him why, he responded ""VIP parking"".

Fuck you Matt."

I had one such genius in a linguistics class. Not even ""the arts"" seem to be safe from douchebags.         
The guy came into our course 6 weeks late, with a note stating he had been ""bedridden"" or something. Later turns out the ""doctor"" who gave him that note was his uncle. Who is a gynecologist.          
Already, we can see the towering intellect of this scumbag.         
He got by with additional notes, excusing himself from group projects until the very last meeting, etc. You cannot imagine how grating it was to have this guy show up on the last day, every time, basically to make sure his name was spelled correctly on the group sheet. Or that it was on it at all.            
Final exam comes around, and guess who has a pink slip again?           
Yeah, he was ""sick"". Tactically so, because the week before he had been asking the doctor (our teacher) all about the re-sit exam, alternative dates, who would supervise, etc.           
Apparently, he felt more comfortable taking the final written exam in front of a relatively untrained substitute teacher, who didn't know him.             
And he got caught cheating. Of course. Of course he did.           
This guy had bought himself some programmable wristwatch (fancy stuff back then) and it actually had a keypad and a small screen. And he notes on that thing.            
This was before ""smart watches"", and the thing was ungodly expensive ....... but the TA had the exact same watch!          
Plus, it turns out our good doctor had told the TA about the suspicious little shit and to keep an eye on him.            
Plagiarism like that gets you booted.          
And, when they looked further into his conduct during the semester, they found out all about his sick notes from the gynecologist.             
He had stolen a block of empty pink slips from his uncle's office and was forging them. So, on top of being shitcanned from uni, this guy had to be reported for document fraud!          
Ahmed, if you read this, you are the suckiest guy I've met during uni so far - by a **huge** margin, and group projects with you still give me adrenalin-fueled flashbacks like I've been to actual Iraq.

270,Hurry up and tell him. The longer you wait the worse it will get. 
271,Don't forget that when you squash a female with eggs the eggs are to small to go squish and they spread everywhere to eventually hatch so they can go on to be shitty little insects that go on to hump and make more shitty little insects.

276,"I had to teach my son how to say ""Pens"". He has this strange issue which luckily wore off where if a letter sounded like another he would say the word strangley. Example, the ""E"" in pens sounds like ""N"", and theres an n right next to it. He pronounced the word ""penis"" at school and was sent home when asking his teacher to open his pack of pens.

""Can you open my penis?"""

285,"You already know this, but I always subscribe to the child as loaded gun philosophy.  You need to expect that something from them, toy, fist, foot, flop their head into your lip, box... is going to come flying from them at any moment.  if you treat them with respect and are always aware of their every move, you might escape without injury.  Except for the slight embarrassment, I am sure the black eye looks cool.    "
286,"I was at work , when the wife called me and told me my 4 year old was bleeding from the head. Turns out wife was cooking, my 7 year old was playing in our room and some how the 4 year old hit his head on the corner on the night stand.

I called 911 and they send am ambulance to take them to the emergency room at the hospital, while i drive to meet them there.

When i got there everyone was looking at me with these hate filled looks( i still remember till this day). I check on the kids and the wife, they are ok. 

Then the nurse start talking to me. Asking what happened? How did this happen? Why does my son have half of dozen dark bruised marks on his back. I told the nurse it was Mongolian spots:
   (Mongolian spots are very common in any part of the body of dark-skinned babies. They are flat, gray-blue in color (almost looking like a bruise), and can be small or large. They are caused by some pigment that didn't make it to the top layer when baby's skin was being formed.)

I told the nurse it was not abuse, she said ""they(abusive parents) always said its not abuse"" her tone was like a cop trying to get a confession out of a criminal. It got so bad with i had to get a doctor to explain to the nurses in the ER . What are Mongolian spots to the ER team. 

"
287,Yeah just let me go grab my azuras star. Brb
288,"I have a similar story from middle school. I found a way into a messaging system for the entire school district. Apparently nobody knew of its existence, so I showed a couple of friends how to get past the security safeguards and send messages to any computer on the network. 

We had our fun messing with people in our class. We sent virus scares, monitoring notices, mandatory restart notices, etc. The messages would pop up over anything you were doing and you would have to hit the red ""X"" to get rid of the message before you could do anything, as the message took absolute priority. 

One day I found a way to duplicate the message as many times as you wanted. We would send 100 identical messages to a class mate and laugh as they frantically clicked the ""X"" 100 times just to get back to what they were doing. Great entertainment! 

Turns out, however, that 3 people doing this to teachers and class mates over and over and over and over again stresses the network. We crashed the entire district and had our principal, super intendent, and 3 IT guys in our class before the hour was over.

I had to show them how to get in. They locked us out... I found another way in..."
