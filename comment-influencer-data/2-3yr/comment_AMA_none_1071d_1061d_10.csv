Have you established a pee corner?
 Make handjobs great again!!!!
"I'm in melbourne, between i95 and the river (within a mile from river). I wasn't in an manditory evacuation area, then yesterday (Thursday) after me and my roommates bought enough supplies to ride out a week or two without electricity, they tell us we are now going to be hit dead on. We don't have tv so we have been relying on the internet and neighbors for information. My roommates literally spent their last penny on baby formula and their car is in the shop right now, radiator blew on Tuesday. My car is barely large enough for us all to fit, so we are hunkering down. We have lots of food and water, but no way to safely leave. So here we are.
It's getting pretty windy right now. Lots of palm fronds being blown around, but nothing of concern at the moment. We still have power, internet and water!

Power went off twice but quickly restored. "
"it's not porn, but it's nsfw for most workplaces. Audio is absolutely necessary, and headphones are highly recommended. Keep volume a little low though, it gets loud at ~20s. The payoff at the 20-30s mark is well worth watching the kinda boring lead up rather than skipping ahead.

[Here is the grapefruit technique \(again, likely nsfw, no nudity\).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ38u5HBdiA)"
Wut up boo
I think you're my wife. 
"Unfortunately not. We do use tools during the workshop, but it doesn't include grapefruit, melon or any kind of pie. I'm considering showing them the video though next time."
And I'm free. 
"One of those asshats dressing up like clowns for social media attention I assume. I live in Philly, North East Philly, so people in my home area know better than to do stupid shit like this. But down here in South NJ people get bored and do shit like this all the time. We used to have a group of people dress up like super heroes and villains, their own characters, and do jackass quality stunts. I hate this town so much. "
OP your man loves you....and that ass. Apparently. Nice!
"No, I don't believe that what the people I was with needed most was the Bible. Or money, since they had no use for it. I don't think it's for me to decide what they needed most, I don't really have any right to. While there were a lot of differences between our cultures (some I weren't superbly fond of), I quickly learned it's difficult to keep an air of superiority when you're the minority surrounded by the way of life you think you're better than."
My girlfriend in high school used to get me going and squeeze a little pre cum out to use as lube and finish me off in her mouth. I still think about that a lot.
"Haha I didn't want to say it because I knew people may make it bigger than I meant it. The idea was more like she as a person was so awful the whole race was like, ""nah"". But I knew some people would think I was attacking ALL black people (and many took it that way). But when she said ""You don't have nothing to say"" it attacked my ego and I went in."
"Haha they actually did not care for it. Wasn't ""safe"" enough."
"Never felt like my life was in danger or anything. But I damn sure had to develop a thick skin and learn not to let words affect me. Also I got profiled by a cop once. But all these incidents made me realize I was had to be proud of where I'm from. if I didn't love my own roots, I had nothing."
"I'm glad you're questioning.  The idea of converting locals is not new,  and has resulted in the rape,  genocide and cultural destruction of hundreds of thousands of people (use Google if you think I'm exaggerating).  It's based off of the idea that these poor savages must be saved which is a dangerous one rooted in colonialism and ignorance "
You're terrible at asking questions.
I'm not a mom and I don't really intend on being one. But he knew this before we got married and I have nice tits without being pregnant so it works out
Lmao
"""You're the reason black men date white women."" is one of the most savage things I've ever heard, were you holding onto that to use at an appropriate time or did it just pop into your head? Either way it was genius! "
Hahahahha. I just watched the video. That was great. How'd your agent like it after all that? Lol
I ain't yo bitch. Sorry
"It wasn't that big of a deal, honestly. We weren't in that deep, we weren't wealthy or well connected, and we didn't have anything they wanted. 

We lived about an hour away from the org, and we basically ghosted once my mom got pissed about stuff with her ex-husband (step dad) who was also in the church.

I don't think I believe anything I was taught still... Every once in awhile, I'll use some of their lines on my mom when I feel like she's being unreasonable, lol! 

What I do appreciate is that because I grew up in a religion that so many people believe is bullshit, it was easier for me to eventually realize it was all bullshit. 

I'm an atheist and I feel like so many more people could ""see the light"" and leave their damaging religions behind if our culture wasn't so religion-centric. 

Sometimes I get annoyed at people's bitchiness about Scientology because they refuse to see that there's so much that's awful in Christianity. Like, yeah, Scientology is bullshit, but so is a virgin birth and letting child molesters go free."
How will they even see this post?  Their phone is gone. 
"We frequently get guys in the store who ask if we still need a model for the workshop :p But (unfortunately) we don't use any real life men. Instead, the table is filled with pink, glow in the dark dildo's to practice on. 

Most of the women do have a guy anxiously waiting at home though ;)"
"It took years for me to understand that I entered that place thinking those people needed saving. I can only imagine how much more good (by ""good"" here I mean actual good - tending the sick and those who were in need) I could have done if I hadn't thought this, as the majority of my time over there was spent reeling from my wrong expectations and not knowing what to with that.

Thankfully I can say my intentions were not conversion. I can't even imagine trying to convince anyone that my way is the better way (I mean seriously, when has that ever worked?) *without* having giant language and culture barriers to overcome. My intention was to help. I believed that some of the things we were teaching (the concept of loving one another, sharing, etc.) were good ways to live.

These people already had a religion they fully believed in, I don't understand how we could have walked in and said ""here's the *right* way of doing things because we say it is"" and expected anyone to go along with it."
"No, I didn't believe most things, just what my mom said to me. Like ""Aliens built the pyramids."" I would parrot that stuff because I was little and believed her. But it's weird, because I've always been fairly scientific so I also believed the science. 

Honestly, *I* was never a Scientologist. I've always been an atheist, ever since I was a small child. 

We stopped going by the time I was in late middle school/early high school because my mom had a falling out with some other church members. 

We just learned weird stuff. I dunno, it's hard to explain. For instance, all learning disabilities are just because one when you were reading you didn't understand a word so it blocked your mind from being able to learn anything else that was written. So, we had tons of dictionaries and had to look up the definition for EVERY word. We'd sit with the teacher and read something together and get quizzed on what a word meant- i.e. ""and."" 

""What does 'and' mean?""

Me, at six, attempts to explain the word ""and.""

""Go look it up.""

I would have to get out a dictionary and read out the dictionary definition of the word ""and.""

My mom and I still do talk. Honestly, I don't think she believes most of it anymore, but we don't talk about it. Our relationship isn't great for a lot of reasons. "
"If you liked it that much and you have a girl right now, just suggest it. If you want an awesome sex life you have to make it awesome yourself. I try new things all the time, but in the end, my SO knows what he likes best and he's not afraid to tell me."
"*""I'm Hindu so I get another life, you don't""* was the best line.  Fucking hilarious."
"Heh. What a question. The best and most honest answer I can give is yes and no. Yes, I still consider myself a Christian. No, I probably am not by some Christian's standards.

I'm thankful it's not Christian's standards I have to live up to - a lot of us have made trying to live up to unattainable standards a way of life."
He stated that he has a mom fetish. Just kinda put two and two together lol
I meditate a lot too and I noticed a lot of irritation arise due to your spelling.
Go on...
"No, surprisingly it was the janitor from the creepy abandon winery next to my moms house. No joke there's a creepy abandoned winery next to my moms house. Awesome place to explore at night. But he wasn't wearing a mask, just some really shitty makeup and some baggy clothes and boots. "
I try :D It's really underestimated. A good handjob does miracles!
You are doing the Lords work
I chose a good one! Thank you. 
was this the first thing you did since being free'd?
"""Losing weight while you suckin' dat dick"""
"Power off for total of three times as of 5:30. Not very long. A few brown out type fluctuations, but all in all, relatively uneventful. "
"I'm commenting to tell you I truly hope that this is the worst it gets for you and that you all remain safe. Said a quick prayer for you, I hope you all stay underwhelmed by The storm.

Obligatory question so my comment doesn't get deleted:

Are you are you alone in your neighborhood? 

Also, i read in a comment that your roommates spent their last penny on formula. if anything does happen and the formula gets ruined, after the storm I would be more than happy to help stock up on some more for the baby.
"
Highest post less than 500? Leave him.
So when's your vasectomy?
"All of the above, and yet you believe that the thing these people needed the most was the bible? Send money, not missionaries."
"Well that's the thing I guess. There is no ""one trick"". Every man is different. I teach different techniques and you just have to try them out and see what your guy likes. In the end, communication is key.

What baffles me though is how few women actually use lube. Everything gets better with lube."
"If it did I don't think it does anymore.

Jk I didn't hit him that hard. "
/r/thathappened
I mean a clown is just a person dressed up like a clown so I guess so 
"&gt;hurricane

&gt;Uneventful"
"So many things are strange. Whenever we were injured mom wouldn't let anyone speak because they would give us ""ingrams"" - basically PTSD that would be trigger when someone said a word that was said while we were in pain.

Some other things to combat ingrams- child birth was supposed to be silent so the infant wouldn't have ingrams growing up. If you're a sick kid and cry for your mom or something, she should never say ""I'm here"" or ""I won't leave you"" because in your mind that would make the illness stay for longer. 

Oh, and if someone dies, you're supposed to scream at them to get back in their body and wake up so the thetan (spirit/soul) would go back into their body and they would live. 

I dunno if anything I know is ""secret"" or not. Probably not. Supposedly something like 20 OT level 8's would ""clear"" the entire world."
"Women are always surprised when I tell them that you can make a guy cum without getting cramps in your arms or hands. 

Also, a lot of women complain that men always ""go for the clit straight away"" without any touching or kissing. But a lot of women do the exact same thing. No gentle stroking, no playing with the balls, just hands in pants and start tugging. "
Well then why don't you start something that interests you more instead of being a dick? 
"Officially speaking I'm not allowed to judge. Instead I should be happy that I can sell them lube. But honestly, I feel sad for their boyfriends. The same with couples who walk past the store. I always see the men taking a peek and the women next to them walking past it with a frown on their faces."
