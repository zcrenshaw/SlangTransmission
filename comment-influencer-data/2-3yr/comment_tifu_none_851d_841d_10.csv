Secret Service into headset: I really scared the hell out of a kid lol.

Own up to it. Your parents will be happier that you were honest with them rather than trying to hide it from them and they figure it out some other way.
"Good story. 

I've always wanted to tell this tale on reddit, and this is probably as good a place as any.

Back in 2009, my Wife and I were on Capitol Hill for a rally. We had been there for several hours, and wanted to refresh our weed buzz. We moved across the lawn to a large bush away from everyone, and proceeded to puff away in the shade. 

We started discussing how many people were there, the security on the rooftops watching over, and whether they had people in the crowd undercover...Generally just making jokes and wisecracking as you do. I said to my Wife, ""Haha, they probably have a sniper in this bush!"".

Directly behind us, in the bush, came a soft, throat-clearing cough. We both instantly froze, apologized to the bush for the smoke in the air, told it to have a nice day, and got the heck out of there.

 Edit: I just wanted to add (Since I have mentioned being a parent) that this was three years before our first child was born, and we had ceased our awful, sinful ways before he was born. I'm still paranoid, and don't want a knock from CPS. Haven't touched the stuff in a loooong time. However, the moment they are adults and it is decriminalized in our state (It will by then), I will certainly be taking a nice long toke. "
"Was CT searching for trauma, or just presence of brain activity?"
"But still. I've never been on a date and thought, ""well this isn't going well, guess I'll have a snooze"""

"Yeah, while this was OPs fault at the base level, fundamentally their boss should have not let them use the system solo 

Edit: also that's a basic travel package? The fuck? "
"Lol. She's literally a ""helicopter mom""
"
"This is as good a place as any for my secret service story.  I was in highschool and was chosen to be in the group of students standing behind Bill Clinton for one of his re-election speeches. As i was in the secret service pat-down line, i realized my keychain in my pocket mayyyy have raised some red flags. It was a 5""long metal bar with finger grooves and a tapered end, known as a fist-pack. 

As i got up to the first secret service agent, i put my hands up and told him he wasn't going to like my keychain. Lol. He asked to see it, i showed him and he just shook his head and said nope. I took it off the keyring and turned it over to him, it was only 8$. But then he told me to find him afterwords, i did, and he returned it to me after Clinton got in his limousine.  I have a weapon thats been in possesion of the secret service!  

"
"Could be worse. I once observed Obama through a rifle scope. It wasn't attached to a rifle, but I didn't realize how stupid it was until I was already doing it. He was giving a speech across the street from my place and I wanted to see him getting into his car. So, looking from the window in my closet I use my rifle scope, as I didn't have binoculars. A few seconds in, it dawns on me what I'm doing. I'm lucky I wasn't shot by a sniper. 

edit: Jesus. I grilled myself and my girl a few burgers...

Anyway, Obama was at the Oregon Convention Center and I lived in NE 1st at the time (Syringe Court). And I did indeed see the man from a rifle scope. I regret that, didn't mean to do it, I'm not a danger to either Mr. Obama or Trump, just that it happened. "

"Can confirm there will never be a bill for Coast Guard search and rescue services. Your federal tax dollars pay for it.

Source: am Coast Guard helicopter pilot, assigned to Miami unit that searched for you last night. Glad you two were alright.

Edit: I don't Reddit good, 'cause I didn't see this blowing up. Sorry to leave everyone hanging overnight. As excited as I was to read this TIFU (because us operators never get the full story on these things, even after the fact), I hit reply and went to sleep since I was the one on duty last night--and you never know when you'll get called out at 2300 for a couple missing 20 year olds, amirite OP??

About ""sleeping on duty:"" A crew is on watch for 24 hours but we have bunk rooms to sleep in, not unlike firefighters. Still on duty, but will try to answer questions and PMs by the end of today.

To clarify: I wasn't the pilot looking for OP, my buddy was. I'm the one that took the watch from him yesterday morning, but you can bet your bottom dollar I'm showing him this post when he comes in this morning.

For those asking if it's a good job: it is, and it's rewarding, but it *is* a job, so don't kid yourself--there's still some bullshit that comes with the territory, but by and large I'm happy in my career.

For those calling bullshit on this post, standby for proof.

And before you say it's not a Coast Guard H-65 because it's not all orange, this one is painted white with orange trim (retro colors as it was painted in the 80s) in celebration of the Centennial of Coast Guard Aviation. This is the exact helo (we have 5 at the unit) that searched for OP!"

"That's a great TIFU.  Once enough people stop shooting and the range gets quiet; everyone looks to see what's going on. I can imagine people walking up asking others what was going on.

"Actually when I was seven years old, my baby brother, Mom, and I were standing in a line to shake Clinton's hand. The Secret Service saw us being partially obscured by all the other people, and pulled us out of the line and brought us to the end out in the open so that Clinton could have a nice photo op with us. He shook my hand and held my brother and kissed him on the head."

"A long time ago, my father saw a ""Do not mix with bleach"" warning label on a bottle of ammonia. Obviously, he had to try it out and see for himself what would happen. He realized pretty quickly what he had just made, quickly opened the bathroom window, and ran out the door closing it behind him."
"A couple of years back I cost my company 6k. It was entirely my fuckup. 
Pale-Faced and a little shaky I went to my boss and told him about it. Then he looked at me, smiled and said ""Congratulations and welcome to the club. My first fuckup cost the company 45k, so yours is pretty cheap. I'm sure you will learn from it and never do it again.""
And that was that. I'm very sorry that not all bosses are like that.

"My wife woke me up really damn early one morning when we were camping by a lake to tell me my sailboat had drifted off during the night. When she asked what I was going to do about it it told her ""Go back to sleep and figure it out later."" Got up a couple hours later, and fully rested, to go get the boat. Was at the south end of the lake so I just sailed it back. 

Moral of the story: Sometimes you just need to sleep on it. "

"Sweden is a lot smaller than the US, but our ministers have bodyguards as well. When I went to uni I helped organize a speech our Minister of Finance gave at our uni. After the event we who helped organize it got to take a photo with him. Only that was not the only event taking place that day that we were organizing, so I had to leave briefly to go get something for the next event. When I came back to the venue as they were letting people out the bodyguards didn't want to let me in. They found it suspicious that I would want to get (back) in just as the speech/Q&amp;A was ending. I had to show them my ID and student ID and answer a bunch of random questions about what the guy had said during his speech to show that I really was one of the organizers and was supposed to be there for the photo. Like, it's great that you're careful, but you didn't search me. In fact nobody who attended got searched or had to go through security of any kind, nor show identification. There was no reason to get hyper vigilant after the event when there was zero security up until that point."
Nah.  In the US we just drag you out by your feet.  THAT'S economical.
Absolutely this. If you think it will harm the plants just flood them. Since they are in pots the excess water can drain and wont kill the plants. Diluting the solution should solve the problem due to plants having very limited time to soak it up. Also may want to watch the drain water and grab a PH test kit just to make sure you didn't screw the PH of your soil.

Remindes me of a schoolmate. Had an internship and they gave him full access to the customer data. Idk how but he managed to delete the whole database and they had... 0 backups. So all the data that gathered over decade's just blew up in dust. Because the Internship had been organized by the school the school insurance paid a few thousand bucks compensation...

Sounds more like a carefully orchestrated insurance fraud.

I have yet to read something about stomach ache and wanting to clean the stomach from the inside with bleach. 
"Dammit, so late to the party, but here's my secret service story. 

I grew up in Manhattan, and when I was a teenager  I would bike all over the city. This particular day I was around the UN building and there was some sort of summit there. Not a big deal but made traffic a nightmare for cars. 

Well,  I was biking down a main thoroughfare and even though technically bikes can't go the opposite direction down one way streets, no one ever obeys that law. I turn of the main avenue and onto a side street gong the wrong way. The only cars are 5 black suvs. I, of course, was wearing my dark jeans, a back hoodie, and a messenger bag. As soon as I pass the first SUV, doors start opening, and about 6-7 dudes jump out, guns drawn and order me to stop and get down on the ground. 

for that moment,  I was the mother fucking usain bolt of getting off bikes. They checked my bag and let me go. And I learned to not ride my bike around the UN building when foreign leaders are in town. "
"So I live in DC. When friends and family come to visit they want to do all the touristy stuff. Naturally, that includes going by the White House. We were there at some point last summer with my girlfriend's family. Her mom was walking along close-ish to the front fence, and a secret service agent walks out from behind a tree and shouts directly at her/us ""HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DID YOU JUST TRY TO JUMP THE FENCE?"" We all froze immediately. After about 2 seconds he slowly cracked a huge ear to ear grin and said calmly ""I'm just messing around with you guys. Keep moving please.""

I'm still not sure if he was actually messing around or if we were really too close to the fence, but I'm not kidding when I say that that moment might be the closest I have ever come to spontaneously shitting my pants."
What is up with that persons foot.
I was more shocked at the part where he saw his girlfriend crying thinking she was dying and his reaction was to drink himself to sleep.
"60 ppm of chlorine gas is considered to be fatally toxic. You mix a 1 to 1 solution of acetic acid and sodium hypochlorite in water. Assuming 10% relative humidity and 90 degrees F ambient temperature, how much of this solution will it take to kill 4 people and a dog in a 200 cubic meter enclosed space? Show your work. lol"
