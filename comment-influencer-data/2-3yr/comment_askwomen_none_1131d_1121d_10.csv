"I dated four men in a row whose first name was Jonathan but who go exclusively by their middle names. I didn't find out they were going by their middle names until after we had been dating for a while. By the fourth one I was like ""are you fucking kidding me??"""
"My exes could easily be brothers. No hyperbole, when I tell my best friend I'm dating someone new her response is ""can I see a picture, or should I just assume?"""
All of my ex boyfriends married the next girl they dated. 
"So, you've finally met Mr. Right?"
Ive dated three different guys who were all born on the same day.
"One of the hard realities of marriage is to learn that the old saying “marriage is 50/50” is bullshit.  It’s hardly *ever* 50/50.  It’s 70/30 or 90/10 or 20/80, and sometimes it’s just plain 100/0.  Rarely will you ever have a situation where a perfect 50/50 compromise is possible.  The hard part is accepting that sometimes you just have to give in, even if sometimes it infuriates you to do so.  But you grit your teeth and put up with it becomes sometimes your partner is the one that has to concede.

Another hard reality is the having to learn to accept your partner’s faults.  I don’t mean cutesy faults like leaving the toilet seat up (or down) or not putting the cap back on the toothpaste.  I mean the I-cannot-believe-you-just-fucking-did-that type of faults.  The kicker is, they’re faults you’re not even going to realize are there until you’ve been married at least several years.  It takes a long time to get to know someone on that level.  There will be times in the middle of a fight when you’d rather eat broken glass than say “I love you”.  But you do, and it’s worth it.  I've been married to this stubborn fucking lunatic for 25 years and I wouldn't trade a minute of it."
"Guy here.. 

The first time I met my ex-girlfriends mother, she greeted me by saying ""Oh nice to see you again *ex-boyfriends name*"" and when I told her I wasn't *ex-boyfriend* she apologized and called me the ex-ex-boyfriend name.

My ex-girlfriend showed me pictures of her ex-boyfriends. We could have all easily be brothers."
coudn't resist
"Of the five serious romantic relationships I have had, all have German as a second language and four have held pilots licenses in the past. None were ever employed as pilots or spent more than a week or two in Germany. I just attract men who choose German in HS and college and feel compelled to learn to fly."

Freud would have a field day with you.
"A friend's mother. She was a plump, stereotypical housewife sort of looking lady with a round, smiling face and heavenly hugs. She told me, ""Sweetie, don't you worry if you don't get to be beautiful. Beauty fades, but cute lasts forever.""

Also, after complaining to my mother that my long distance boyfriend never visited me after I'd made several costly trips to see him, she said, ""People will treat you the way you let them. You've taught him that this is okay, that you will always make the effort. Fix it."""
"I think people make too much of differences between boys and girls. Sure there's some biological stuff around puberty, but other than that, don't treat your daughter in a special way just because she's a girl. All I ever wanted from my dad was to treat me like my brother. Instead he was over protective and told me I wasn't allowed to do things that weren't ladylike.

The best environment for a girl to grow up in is one where she doesn't feel less than or different for being a girl. You want her to feel like you guys can bond as equals, not that you're a ""man"" and she's a ""girl"" and you're opposites."
"Any time a ""mixed signals"" question gets posted on /r/askwomenadvice. 99% of the time there are no mixed signals at all. It's usually just ""they said they don't want to date me, but they still are nice to me! What does this mean?!"""
"Because being a guy is seen as a good thing, and being a girl is often used as an insult. 

Edit: This distinction is made early, too. When I was in fourth grade I was both insulted (by a coach) for ""running like a girl"" and praised (by a teacher) for being ""better at math than most of the boys."" So. "
"My exes were both secretly in love with their best friends, if that counts?"
"Whenever someone mentions they are a woman it's usually followed by ""prepare your inbox"", ""no GW posts, I checked"" and other hurr durr I'm so funny comments."
"They're loud and rude to everyone around them. 

And they make fun of others in ways that are pretty much bullying, but because it's *banter* it's suddenly okay. ""It's just a joke, man. Didn't know you were such a pussy.""

They also don't handle it well when it's going the other way. 

Edit: thought of someone else who uses his religion not to do stuff. He doesn't put his shit away after lunch because that's *a woman's job* where he comes from. "
"For me, it would have to be in a confession posted recently a dad of a high school volleyball player admitted to eyeing the other girls outlines of their labia in their uniforms. Then the barrage of redditors who told this old ass man that it was OK because ""females are biologically ready to breed at that age."" 

I called him out on the grossness and everyone hated me. "
"No one knows what to have for dinner.  Ever.  You might think the other person will know and be able to solve the ever-pressing question, but they don't.  It's just an endless cycle of ""What do you want for dinner?"" and ""I don't know. Does anything sound good to you?""

More seriously, there are more family things to balance.  Not just your own family, but extended family.  ""Are we going to cousin Y's 30th birthday party?""  ""What weekend was your aunt supposed to be in town?""  ""Your step-dad's brother's son is getting married. Are we doing anything for that?""  All these can sound like silly things on their own, but this stuff piles up quickly, especially (or depending) if either of you have particularly large or close families (or both of you do)."

My first boyfriend had my brothers name. The last two have my dads name. I try not to think about it
"My past two boyfriends were tall, lanky redheads who were also virgins. Also, the first of the two once said that Churchill would be a cute name for a bulldog. The second of the two actually did have a bulldog named Churchill. "
Lefties!  For some reason everyone I've dated has been left handed.  
"""I'm only nice to her because I want to sleep with her, so why would she be nice to me if she doesn't want to sleep with me?""

This mentality would be (almost) tolerable if it weren't for the few that don't grow out of it.."
I ended up with a ton of dudes commenting on how they hate women who have short hair and that no men will ever be attracted to me again. 
"My (crazy) mom: ""Give a husband what he wants in bed and you'll never have to work for a living.""

Sorry Mom, not a prostitute. Also I find my career fulfilling, sooo..."
"The same thing has happened to me. When my last relationship ended about 2 weeks ago I even made a joke to him about it. ""Congrats on your upcoming wedding"" He wasn't amused. "
"My friend's mom advised her on the eve of her wedding night that the best way to ""keep him under your thumb"" was to withhold sex from him if he didn't do whatever she wanted, and that if he didn't bring her a cup of tea in bed every single morning he was a bad husband (???)..... Needless to say this woman has been divorced for a very long time now"
Any time there's a photo involving a woman on the front page you can find a sea of really stupid comments in the thread. I remember seeing a cute photo of the actor who plays The Mountain in Game of Thrones giving his girlfriend a piggy back ride and there were literally a hundred comments talking about how stretched out her vagina must be. Ughhhhh.
"Um, maybe it's time to leave Cancer Valley?"
"It felt... Meh. Really meh. I wasn't repulsed, but, to quote Angelina Jolie in the movie Gia... ""I could have done that with a German Shepherd."" 

I liked their faces, sometimes. I mean a lot of faces are androgynous and could easily belong to a butch woman. But I didn't enjoy getting close to them. Whereas with women, I turned into putty because of how soft they felt and how good they smelled.

I dated way too many guys. Like 5-ish actual boyfriends, about 15 more who I casually dated, and 7 one-night stands. I just lay there and took it, and they didn't want to do anything more either it seems. So I was just a hole for their dick I guess. And I got to call myself bisexual and keep being treated like part of hetero society - that was the main reason I was so determined to like guys!

I finally realised I was gay when I slept with women and realised men could never, ever compare. And I gave them enough chances to know it wasn't just ""that guy"". 

People do treat me a lot weirder now that I'm gay. Now it's not that I'm into girls, it's that I'm *not* into guys. I'm totally going against nature and biology and all that. I've had people tell me that if everyone was like me, humanity would die out. And I still have moments where I worry that being gay is a disorder. Still much internalised homophobia to deal with."
"My ex wife remarried a carbon copy of me, down to the exact piercings. Met the guy for the first time and we both kinda went, huh. Some people have a very specific type"
"I was married to an abusive man and I wanted to leave but was scared. I think I had battered wife syndrome or something. My aunt knew what was going on and asked me ""If your daughter were in the same situation what would you tell her? That's what you need to do."" It was about 2-3 weeks later, I packed what I could fit into my car and never saw him again. I've given the same advice to other women because it's what saved me and is probably the reason I'm still alive. "
4/5 guys that I've dated have been named Daniel. The other guys middle name was Daniel. 
"The other shaving tip that I will never understand is to shave with the grain. Oh, it prevents bikini bumps? You know what else it prevents? Hair removal. Seriously, do all you people get a smooth, hairless shave when going with the grain? Whenever I do it, it leaves a millimeter of super prickly and visible stubble. Then I just have to go over it against the grain anyway. What's the point?"
"Damn, Daniel"
"Yes, absolutely.  Also, if you feel like you're doing 50% you're probably doing much less.  If you feel like you're doing 70% you're probably only at 50%.  Generally, people overvalue their own contributions and overlook their partner's."

Did you tell any of them that they had the same name as the guy before?
Do you have any particular fascination with Red Baron pizza?
All my ex boyfriends have been pieces of shit. Seems to be a constant pattern.
I honestly can't narrow it down to one thing. The incel sub is pretty nutso and hateful though. 
"My biggest piece of advice is not to insult your wife in front of her. 

As a child, I heard my dad make snide remarks on my mother's weight and I lived the rest of my life placing my worth in my weight. It led to a long struggle with anorexia so that my dad could never say what he said to my mother, to me. 

I hope you have a healthy, happy baby and the best of luck guiding this precious little being in the world. "
"Thursday night my little sister and I got purposefully drunk, got out the art supplies, cued up Bob Ross on Netflix, and experienced the joy of painting.  Occasionally we obeyed our only rule, ""Drink when you feel the joy of painting"" which was basically whenever he said something adorable.  Our paintings turned out freaking awesome too.  "

"""Sometimes guys like to be the little spoon."" 

This wasn't directed at me but to a group I was in and I just thought it was so cute/sad, like all he wanted was for a the girl to hold him every once in awhile."
"It didn't feel wrong right away. Or rather it did, but I didn't know it. For example, I asked my straight friends ""Is it normal to not like penises?"" and they were like ""Yeah of course, I hate blowjobs!"" That continued well into my late 20s. Tons of straight friends recounting their miserable sex lives, which were identical to my miserable sex life, so that really threw me off.

I should have realised hey, I freakin love going down on women, maybe that means something... But I was too crippled with the fear of being gay. It was cool to be ""bi"". But gay was used as an insult: ""That's so gay"". Most of all, my family made it clear that they thought homosexuality was unnatural and weird. 

I dated/slept with about 8 guys before I realised I couldn't do it anymore. "

"When I realised it was supposed to become my life and when a manager didn't approve my request for time off and I thought,""fuck that, I'm having time off when I want.""

So I quit and started my own business and was broke for ages, but now I'm doing ok and I take holidays whenever the hell I want to."
"One of my best friends. I'd broken up with a bf and was feeling blue. She told me what her ballet teacher (who is the most amazing woman!) told her after her first heart-break;

""The heart is a muscle, the more you use it the bigger and stronger it gets, the less you use it the weaker it gets and the harder it is to open up and love - it might be hard right now, but do your best to keep using your heart."""
"the endless warbling about ""preferences"" and how they're *sacred* and cannot be questioned at all, literally ever. 

there's this weird pushback against *ever* thinking critically about your own sexual interests"
"i have had 5 boyfriends with cancer. could be the region (dubbed 'cancer valley'), but it's a higher number than my friends"
Food. I just... Really think food is great. But I'm also kinda lazy

"I make maps.

I would really love to open a bakery catered to people with nut allergies like me!  I am often screwed when bakeries don't know if they used almond extract in their frosting or batter (I have been surprised many times and the following reaction is less than pleasant).  I would call it No Nuts Bakery, and the mascot would be a squirrel because the squirrel would be taking the nuts instead.  :)"
"And ironically, the other thing you see all the time on Reddit is, ""It's so disgusting how people assume men are perverts and pedophiles!""

Sometimes it's the same dudes arguing both things."

"Bathtub issues.  Don't get me wrong,  I like personal hygiene, but it was one of the questions I asked my now fiancé on our first date.  The last one would sit in the shower for hours on end, when the hot water ran out she would wait 15 minutes and get back in.  Just sitting there.  The whole house was steamed up and condensation dripping off the walls in the living room.  An ex boyfriend of mine took a bath after almost everything.  Wake up, bath. Take a poop, bath. Eat dinner, bath, got a pain in your tummy, bath.  Drank a bottle of jack, bath.  I couldn't take it.  "
"Pretty much any product that is supposed to prevent razor bumps. You people keep shouting coconut oil and other more specific products but the only way I've found to prevent bikini bumps was to just stop shaving and use an electric shaver instead.

Edit: please stop telling me your specific solutions for shaving. I've tried everything and I don't even shave anymore really so please."
"Coconut oil is comedogenic, meaning it can clog your pores. I am not going to use that shit on my acne-prone skin!


If it works for you, great, but I hate seeing it touted as a product *everyone* should use as a moisturizer."
Unrelated note; I love your username.
"She has NO FILTER and will literally say anything that comes to mind no matter the setting (example: ""I make my boyfriend shave EVERYTHING downstairs because pubes make me remember my rape"" at a crowded dinner table full of strangers at a wedding. Her boyfriend was sitting right next to her and nearly died of embarrassment.) She's also physically and emotionally abusive to said boyfriend. She will drone on and on and on telling stories about people you've never met and showing you weird sores and boils on very private parts of her body. She tried to make me touch all her dildos once.The second you start to talk her eyes glaze over and she gets all fidgety and then starts talking over you,  continuing whatever bullshit story she was on. Within the first hour of meeting her she was showing me photos of herself standing next to the corpses of her niece and brother and told me the whole murder-suicide saga. Even though her daughter is 10, she still lactates and sometimes the milk curdles in her nipples and makes cheese. She uses a little nipple-suction-cup to get the cheese out. Then plays with it before she throws it away. *Her parents met in a mental institution.* This woman is my sister-in-law.

When her dad stayed with us for a while he intentionally smeared his poop all over the toilet TWICE. And he'd pee on the porch railings when he didn't think anybody was watching. 

I don't like this woman or any bit of her family. Ech."
My best friend always jokes that when I get married I'll see every guy I've ever dated on the grooms side since they all look so alike they must be related 
As if I needed another sign from the universe I should chop all mine off
"Picky eaters. And I used to be a chef, and still love to cook. Cons: they don't like eating anything exotic. Pros: knowing how to cook allows me to sneak vegetables in, or create dishes with flavor profiles they like. "
Men who are 'one of the girls' are likely to get more shit for it than the other way around. 
"Before I was a traditional Barber I was a Hairstylist and had a female clientele. There was a woman in my chair one day and I found out she was 99 years old! She was happy and healthy,  didn't need a walker and was sane...  I didn't believe it for her age.  She didn't look a day over 70 and she was so flattered when I said so.  Then through out her hair service I asked her to teach me something she would tell her 29 year old self (as I was that age then). 

She said "" The stupid things you worry about now, the things that may seem like you can't live without,  you're going to not only laugh at when you're my age but you'll wonder why you wasted all that time worrying about and making yourself feel unhappy over. ""

She admitted that it was hard to think this way when she told me about her first husband whom she thought she would still be with but she had to dump his cheating ass back in her 30's. Wasted years trying to get over him until she met her true love, who then died much later in life.  She was on her third husband when she realized how much she's been through and wished she hadn't spent so much of it worrying about what people thought, about what she has to do to please others instead of herself when it's her life she was supposed to live.  

Basically,  pick the happiness flowers and keep them,  cut out the weeds.  

Oh, and she mentioned something about living in a man's world but that's a whole other level of feminism I wish I had time to listen to but I had another client waiting. 

I never saw her again. I should have gone with her for tea or something. 

Edit: Spelling.

Edit 2: Just got double gold for this comment.  Thank you kind strangers!  "
"A guy who said vaginas got looser with EACH sexual partner, not with amount of sex (obviously we know neither would cause this, but I'm shocked he was able to come up with a reason that specifically targeted promiscuous women).  In his mind, after a few partners, the woman's vagina ""forgets"" what shape it's supposed to be in, gets ""confused"" and atrophies.  Obviously no medical sources, just his opinion, and I think he even admitted to being a virgin with zero female contact, so that's not me shaming him for being a virgin, it's just true...

Also, this one older dude on some other sub told me my anxiety disorder was caused by me being an entitled millenial who won't grow up.  When I calmly pointed out to him that I'm married, gainfully employed, financially independent and anxiety has run in my family for generations, he informed me he was diagnosing me with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) because apparently anything other than just believing his assessment of me (a stranger) right off the bat was ODD."
She used to date this guy but now she bangs his twin the end 
"It's not that I'm repulsed by sex with men, it just feels like *work*. Sex with women is like, ""oh my god, I can't believe how lucky I am that I get to look at her naked and touch her! This is the BEST THING EVER! I want to do this forever nonstop until I die!""
"
"I'm an office manager. 

If I could do anything else in the world, I'd open a cat winery. It would be like one of those cat cafes, but with wine instead of coffee."
"Almost all of the comments about racism. 

Things like ""white privilege doesn't exist, I grew up poor and worked for everything I got"" and ""if anything, black privilege exists"". 

I hate this site a lot of the time. "
"""ask for what you need"", from one of my university professors. "
"""Mixed race relationships are devils work."" ""Black men are put on this earth by the devil to tempt white women.""

Bit of background, ex co worker who was extremely religious and clearly attracted to black men. She used to get really angsty when couples in mixed race relationships would come in the store and always comment about them to me. 

Luckily she was agency and didn't stick around for long. After she'd left my male co worker, who happens to be black, said she made him uncomfortable as she always seemed to flirt with him when nobody else was around and then blanked him when they were. 

She was only young and I get the impression that these were more the views of her parents and she was clearly sexually attracted to black men and basically felt terrible for it. Hopefully she realises how ridiculous these views are soon and can go on to live a happy life with the man of her dreams."
"Omg and the whole idea that all these twenty year old women are looking for a sad, balding, slightly upper middle class man (with hobbies). I see that all the time on Reddit and no where else. "
A roommate in college dated three guys in a row with the first and last name initials CR. She married the last one.
"""men age like wine"""
"I think about totally random things - lettuce. books. stairs. fruit. 

I just run through a list of random objects to distract myself and calm myself down enough to stop the tears."
"Being the little spoon, as a guy, is awesome. I get warm really easily and my girlfriend has the body heat of a small sun so regular spooning is a bit uncomfortable. If she's the big spoon then there's less surface area touching her and I'm comfortable as can be. Added benefit: she gets to pretend she's a sloth, and just wrap herself around me."
"What she didn't tell you was that on a drunken night out with the first one, she got ""I &lt;3 CR"" tattooed near her naughty bits. The rest of her dating life was spent seeking out dudes with those specific initials so she didn't have to get it removed."
"I used to work at a domestic violence shelter. One woman (resident) came up to the front desk to chat with all of us early 20s staff and ended up lecturing us about relationships. Anyone who was dating someone for more than 6 months without talking about marriage was being accused of ""not being serious"" because she and *her* husband got married after 3 months of knowing each other. One woman was currently dealing with a stalker and she was told ""that's just how it is, you have to accept that's how he is. Give him a chance"".  Again, more comparison to her husband. 

It was funny how bad her advice was until it hit me that the relationship she was holding up as an example to us was most likely the reason she was in shelter in the first place. "
"Same.  My dad said when he met my now husband, ""What's that asshole doing back here?""

Different one, Dad."
"Don't bother playing the lottery, you have used up your ""luck"" with numbers. "
"You're afraid to bring up certain subjects. You feel like you have to edit yourself before you speak, and not just common courtesy of not being rude. "
"Dating: exclusive relationship (only seeing each other, unless it's a mutually agreed upon open relationship)

Casual dating: early stages dating - e.g. You're going on dates, possibly with multiple people, just to get to know them and see if you want to continue seeing them.

Fwb: sex only, no relationship.

Seeing someone: could be casual or serious dating - ""I just started seeing someone"" and ""sorry, I'm not interested, I'm seeing someone"""
"When I was about four years old I was in the living room with my parents and company.   I was told to get ready for bed so I started to take off my clothes.   My mom stopped me quickly and said to me, **""reptilesni, we don't take off our panties in public.""**  It's advice I took to heart and it's served me well throughout my life."
"Usually in a massive lack of desire for anything. I don't want to read, I don't want to watch anything, I don't want to go for a walk, I don't want to grocery shop, I don't want to go to bed, I don't want to get up, I don't want to be in contact with anyone I know, I don't want to cook an actual meal, I don't want any affection, I don't want to ""talk about it"". Everything is ""meh"", ""I don't know"", ""doesn't matter"", ""I don't care"". It feels like I'm this cold, numb person with no interest in anything and no willpower to do anything, whether necessary or for enjoyment.

There's also this feeling of constant exhaustion. When it's really bad I'll usually only be able to stay awake for a few hours then go back to sleep, then get up for a few hours and then back to sleep again. Everything feels utterly *pointless* and having to be awake and conscious feels aggravating."
Ate an ice cream sandwich in the tub for dinner. Because I'm an adult.
"From a very, very religious friend in high school:

""You don't have sex for *pleasure!*""

It just made me feel super sad because she made it clear that she expected her lot in life to be getting married, staying home, and having as many kids as possible. And that's cool if that's your jam, son! The thing that made me sad was that she viewed it as her Sacred and Irrefutable Biological Duty to lie there and think of England so she could have oodles of kids because ""there aren't enough [insert her religious group]s in the world!"" "
"You might be related tothe posterabove who dated all men who look the same.

"It doesn't fix any problems that existed in the relationship before marriage. I've seen too many couples that operated under the assumption that ""such and such will be better once we're married"" and didn't put in the work to actually fix their problems."
"""Don't put out too fast. If you do the guy will just use you and discard you because you're easy, guys like the chase. If you don't respect yourself and fuck too early, he will go away and tell all his friends what a slut you are. Men are like that, we have to respect ourselves because they won't"". Sadly said by a woman. I found it sad because of the internalized misogyny, the deep shame this girl felt because she had let a guy touch her over her clothes on the first date and the horrible thoughts she had about men. She really thought they were animals out for prey."
"Someone in an /r/relationships thread is trying to argue with me right now about how people with mental illnesses are completely incapable of having good relationships.  If you ever need a reminder about how mental illnesses are still stigmatized, wander on over there for a few hours."
"Do women have a sense of self/inner voice?

Don't recall if that was the exact wording, but the person was basically asking if we were people."
Why would you date him :(
"My boyfriend once (jokingly) said ""men age like wine and women age like milk."" I knew he was joking but I still got defensive about it and told him remarks like that are why women are horribly insecure when they start showing signs of aging (and even before.) because men and women generally age the same. Neither ages better than the other. People who take great care of their health generally are the ones who age better regardless of if their a man or woman. I think Carrie Fisher said it best when she said men don't age better, they're just allowed to age. Because its sadly true to reality.

But I knew he was joking because he actually adores kind older women and regularly compliments them in a not weird way... "
"We're both quiet blue-collar guys, same height and build, same lower lip piercing and a hole in the ear where one used to be. Even the children she had with him followed the same pattern of a daughter and 2 years later a son. 

We acknowledge eachother's existence, we aren't into drama. Had to reassure my daughter it was ok to call him dad but it was a hoot when his daughter tried to start doing the same. "
Start a fake rant about how trans-dimensional people shouldn't be allowed to use the same bathrooms as cis-dimensional people and see how they react ;P
"I (23F) was born without any functional female reproductive parts. Never being able to raise my own child is... Heartbreaking. I understand adoption is totally something I could try to pursue, but my partner wants to have his own genetic offspring... I would be okay with him having a child with another woman, and co-raising the child, but the feeling of not having my very own, from my womb, would still linger.

When people ask about children, or even assume it's an inevitability, I just want to scream... Or when other women tell me that I'm lucky since I don't menstrate, as though the reminder of my sterility is a comfort.

I would strongly prefer not to see a therapist. I've seen too many over depression/anxiety/queer things that I just really don't want to open that door again..

Anyways... any advice would be appreciated.

Cats are nice, I guess..

edit: I lot of people are urging for adoption. It's something that I had thought about before the full brunt of my sterility had struck me. I know it would mean a lot for a kid to have a nice/comfortable life (in the process of getting a degree which will hopefully pay nicely, nice hours, good family environment, etc). It's not that I'm inherently opposed to adoption, it's just that being pregnant, having my biological child, that whole process being ripped away from me is just frustrating and I thought I'd reach out. "
"I always post this on threads from dads asking for advice about raising girls and it's worth repeating:

*Pay attention to your friends.*  

My dad cut off contact with a longtime friend of his who he caught leering at me inappropriately in my bathing suit at a pool party when I was 12 (his friend was mid-40s, like my dad)

Please be aware that unwanted male attention does not always just come from strangers.

Sometimes it's your own friends."
"   Well I don't know if anyone else notices this, but pretty much any time a post is made about a women's issues such as rape, abuse or partner violence, there are dozens and dozens of men who immediately respond by bringing up prison rape, gang murder rates that show more men die than women, or post articles about how women are falsely reporting their rapes. Do these guys really think we're gonna buy their self obsessed bullshit?    
  No, we can see their comments for what they are: desperate plea for attention and a knee jerk reaction to silence women's voices. We know better than to dismiss other women's experiences because men also experience problems. Just because men also suffer does not mean it's okay to belittle or dismiss the specific experiences of women. We would not silence a man who posts an article about an important men's issue so why can't you do us a solid back?  "
"I've dated 10 ballet dancers. They've also all, 1-10, cheated on me with exes. "
He thinks we're friends and we're not. He gossips well beyond the social lubricant stage. I don't trust him with anything personal which makes all of his faux intimacy more awkward.

Hey at least it was secret. One of my exes was quite open about it and how I could never match up to her in his eyes. 
Eh i still enjoyed sex despite never orgasming before I did. More likely she just had shit selfish partners 
"I would also add a distinction for OP - a FWB is usually a friend or acquaintance who you also spend time with platonically - or at least it wouldn't be weird if you did. 

A fuck buddy is someone you have in your life only for sex, and it would be rare to hang out with them for other reasons. "
"I'm coming up to seven years. I'm happier than ever. The only 'reality' I've come to terms with is having to let things go. If they do something that irritates you, and you've brought it up many times but they still do it, try to let it go. You're probably doing something to annoy them too. That thing from a year ago? Where you were right about something? Let it go. 

My wife is my best friend. We go through all of life's challenges together and can't wait to see where it all takes us. We are a team first and foremost. It's amazing to know that no matter what, I've got someone who unquestioningly has my back. 

We love the shit out of each other. We have occasional disagreements but no major fights of any kind. We're usually on the same page and if not, we respect where the other is coming from. We allow ourselves to be separate people. We have many interests that overlap and many that don't. That's great--I'd hate to be married to myself. We each help the other become better people.

I know this isn't everyone's experience but it's mine, so I wanted to share. :)"
"I've gone through...like...libido swings? Where I'll want nothing to do with sex for months on end, and then suddenly sex is all I want. When I was trying to get past my worst ""no sex, please"" swing, I asked my partner if we could just kiss for a while, just make out like teenagers, without trying to take it any further. I found that once I stopped worrying about when he'd get tired of kissing me and try to take off my pants, I eventually *wanted* him to take off my pants. It didn't work every single time, but...it did work for us more often than not."
"That guy who asked if women were sentient/have an ""inner monologue"". "
"I have a Google calendar for meals that just repeats the same thing every 4 weeks. That's long enough apart that you don't get sick of eating the same thing but often enough that I can make most of the recipes by memory now. And I have a few standbys for when I don't feel like cooking. I also save money that way because no food waste since I know exactly what to buy.

EDIT: for the people who asked me to share the calendar, I really don't want to make it public and the items are my shorthand anyway. For example: taco salad. That doesn't explain anything about what goes into it or how I make it.

The best way to go about making a calendar of your own is to just add one meal you know and set it to repeat every 4 weeks. Then when you come across another meal that works for you, add it with the repeat. Continue as you discover stuff until your calendar is filled. It can take months but then it's YOURS."
"Change her diapers and clean her spit-ups.  

Girls' bodies are just as squishy and messy and gross as boys' bodies, and you want to be totally desensitized by the time she's old enough to remember things.  The goal here is for you to never show disgust at her normal body functions because girls get enough of that from the rest of the world.

You will also gain a much more pragmatic attitude toward clothing and appearance if you're the one changing her at 2 am.  Girls' clothes very often have stupid frills or are structured in very impractical ways, even BABY girls' clothes, and you will lose patience with that when you're fumbling to untie a row of unnecessary bows in order to clean up the poop that she's got all the way up her back.

"I'd been in my previous industry for over three years.  Worked hard.  Got great reviews from guests (I worked in the hotel industry).  Knew my stuff.  I felt I did pretty darn well. :)

January of this year. Major snowstorm dumps over a foot of snow on the area, and of course, I'm caught at work. No big, it's a hotel, we aren't selling the rooms in this weather (that much snow shuts down anywhere in the south for days), make yourself at home. I'd packed a suitcase expecting this.

While there, the contracted landscaping company responsible for shoveling our sidewalks and plowing the drive decides? Claim they're unable to come out when scheduled. 

So we've got a hotel with a bunch of northerners just wanting to pack and go home, and a hotel coated in snow.  So, being the type who puts her nose to the grindstone and who had parents and an upbringing that made sure I'm able to do whatever needs to be done?  Guess who got drafted into snow shoveling.   (I actually kind of loved it.  Nails got demolished, but it was invigorating.)

I get the sidewalks cleared, and help the drivers who do try to leave get their vehicles out.  Totally successful. Guests are thrilled, and when the work crew arrives 12 hours later, even they seemed pleasantly surprised.

Week later, it's my six month performance review. I'd been recruited to join this hotel's staff from my previous job, which I'd loved and been at forever.  The general manager had the audacity to say I didn't ""go above and beyond"".  I, the queen of the 50 hour work week, and Miss Snow Shovel 2016, am not going above and beyond.  I was one of the two who literally had to train *her* to do her job when she started two months before.  I decorated the lobby for events, holidays, and special occasions.  I helped with breakfast service on a few occasions. I repaired more than a couple televisions.  But no, I'm not even going above and beyond

I got an interview in the industry I used to be in (and that I liked loads better) within a week.   Got hired.  I wound up not even getting to fulfill my notice. Two days into my notice, I dropped the cash drawer less than a dollar short and was separated for ""inability to implement cash handling policies"".  I went to the local grocery store, bought a couple of bottles of wine, and spent two whole days celebrating. 

It's six months in, and I've yet to find myself sitting in the bathroom sobbing at the state of my life.  That is a definite improvement. "
Ironically harassing women is the most annoying shit on this website.
"I got pregnant while using the NuvaRing. I had been using it about 4 months. I had no idea I was pregnant. I wasn't allowing a period in between swapping rings, so no ""missed"" period. I started getting really angry and feeling weak. I thought it was my body reacting poorly to the NuvaRing and took it out. A week later, I had horrible cramping and began to bleed. It started getting heavy and clotty. I thought it was like a ""make up"" period or something since I didn't have one for 4 months. The bleeding became extremely heavy and I heard a loud splash in the toilet. Looked in and saw a mass with a sac attached. Since pregnancy wasn't in my mind,  I freaked out and thought I was dying. I took a ladle and scooped up the mass I had just passed (gross, I know. But I wanted to make sure the doctors could test and see what came out of me), put it in a baggy and went to the ER. They told me I had just had a miscarriage. I was dumbfounded. The bleeding really slowed down by that time and I felt so much relief. My body got rid of something I absolutely didn't want. I was scared of trying other pills because I reacted poorly, so I had a tubal ligation. I do take the pill now (5 years after the ligation) to regulate my hormones to stabilize my mood swings. Trial and error to find one that finally worked for me. The combo of a pill that works well with my body and the ligation is the best choice I've made."

"I think people spend too much time looking for red flags that they aren't compatible and not enough time looking at why it works. 

There are going to be areas in EVERY relationship where you and your partner are not compatible. There is NO perfect person. Everyone has their faults. If you go into a relationship saying ""Ok...now I have to keep out an eye for reasons why this isn't going to work out..."" Then you're going to find reasons. It's self fulfilling. 

Far better to look out for differences and simply ask, ""Can I live with this?"" or ""How can we negotiate this difference."" Sure, there should be things like signs they're abusive or not honest - but you should be looking for that before and during the honeymoon phase. "
Just wait until you find out the name of your SO's childhood postman/mailman

They think that women should be assigned to men by the government because it's not fair that Chad (the name they give to a stereotypical ladies man) gets all the women while they get none.
You do you. Lots of folks making babies all around the world.
My best friend has dated...  I want to say 4 guys named Steve/Stephen.  Including her current boyfriend.  In total she's been in 5 or 6 relationships?  
"It's always about 60% people talking about how they'd totally do the lady (as if the creeps would ever even get the chance), 30% complaining about how ""this only got upvoted because girl"", 6% saying she's actually pretty ugly and they totally wouldn't bang her (again, not like they'd ever get an offer anyways) and 4% people actually discussing whatever cool thing she's doing in the photo."
Wanting to follow any religion would make me disappointed but it's not like I'm gonna stop them.
"Remember that she is her own person, not your prize. The whole ""I'm going to shoot any boy who comes through the door"" is cute but incredibly misogynistic. Her body, her rules (not your rules).

Don't hold her back. Don't stop her from doing things or dressing how she wants because it's not feminine. Yes, be afraid she's going to get hurt like any good parent, but don't hold her back. Let her compete against the boys. Let her get her scrapes and bruises and play with the other kids.

**Compliment her mind and intellect.** The first thing girls hear as a compliment from anyone is ""You're so pretty!"" or ""I love your dress!"" 90% of the time, our compliments are physical. Compliment her mind. Tell her how thoughtful she is. Challenge her intellectually. Instead of telling her what a pretty little girl she is, empower her - ask her what her favorite book is.

Validate her emotions. No, she's not just emotional. Girls aren't just more emotional than boys. When she's upset, or when she's happy, or any emotion, it's legitimate. Even if you wouldn't be upset in her shoes, or you don't understand why she's upset, remember that there is a reason she is upset, and listen to her when she talks about it. Be her safe space. You want to be the person she feels she can come to for help. You don't want her to feel she needs to go to someone else, or worse, that she's alone."

"We spent about $5000 Canadian.  Honestly, I don't think I'd change anything.

Splurges were:  Photography, Food, Beer.

We only invited about 50 people, and the venue was my parent's back yard.  Their neighbor (who is an avid gardener) offered to lend us all of her potted flowers for decoration.  Dress was a last season/off the rack deal for about 400 bucks.  We had a meal out at a nice restaurant in town, then back to my parents back yard for a bonfire, snacks, and beer.  Cake was free, from a friend of my husband's.  Snacks were free, from my husband's workplace.  

Was it a super classy, high society wedding?  No.  It would never be featured in any kind of magazine.  But my friends and family were there, the price was definitely right, and I got to marry the love of my life.  We've been married 7 years now, and neither of us have regrets about our wedding.  Except one of the salads at the restaurant, it was disgusting and we still talk about it.  So much regret for that salad.

Well, every morning of the second day, my hair was greasy and disgusting and looked bad. Never got accustomed after a year, so I said fuck it and resumed shampooing every day. And my hair looks and feels great every day. "

She currently has her eyes on some guy in her church group and she's just waiting for him to make a move (it's been half a year now). I suggested that she strike up a conversation with him, maybe test the waters for any interest, and her response was to scoff and give me a look of intense judgemental pity. I just want her to be happy :(

"In my early 20's, I assumed I'd be married and settled down by the time I reached 30. I am about to be 29, and I am single, live in a condo, and nowhere near ""settled down."" I also realized that life trajectory wasn't for me. Being a product of suburbia, and having been told my whole life That's Just What You Do, I didn't even realize I had a choice. I assumed marriage and children would just happen to me, like some sort of inevitable train hitting me.

At this point I'm not sure if I even want to get married, and even less sure that I want kids. 

Also, people always would talk about how by the time you hit 30, your metabolism crashes, your body starts aching for no reason, your hangovers get worse, etc. I've actually found the opposite to be true...I'm in the best shape of my life. I began counting calories and lost 40 pounds, and I run half marathons, something I only dreamed of in my early 20's. People regularly mistake me for a college student. The aches and pains are yet to be felt. When I drink, I drink a lot more water and choose higher quality alcohol. My hangovers are non existent. 

Honestly, I think a lot of people give up at this point...they've been told college is the best four years of their life (it isn't) and so they settle into relationships and jobs that are safe and just sort of stay there."
"I don't even remember what the question was, but it was a guy talking about how women with large breasts can't breathe properly when they walk because with every step our breasts squeeze our lungs and make us sigh out a bit of air or something.

"Oh god, both of what you already said. Also, not hanging onto food and condiments that we never use/that went off in 2010/etc. Basically downsizing everything, my family are hoarders.

"I did it a few times when I was in college. I luckily had no side effects, was very fertile and have 3 sets of twins among other children out there. I don't think of them as mine, especially since I have my own now. I am happy that I did it and gave couples a chance to have their own children. I had a fantastic dr and the hardest part for me was driving, her office was about an hour away from me. It's like going through a heavier period but you seriously have to take it easy after retrieval. You bloat and feel uncomfortable but it's only a few days. After I had my own baby, the recovery from that was 10 times worse. Good luck, it's not for everyone and I tell others who think about it to make the decision in their own. In the end, it's your eggs and people will have opinions but you are helping someone else have a child that will love it and take care of it. It's a great feeling. "

Dog didn't make a damn peep the whole time he was in there, even though we were calling his name and shaking around a peanut jar (his favorite snack) for hours. Happy as a clam when we let him out, though, it did not seem to faze him at all."

Feminism isn't just securing the right for women to do traditionally male things, it's demanding that traditionally female things be valued equally as well. Depending on the person, I either try to point this out, ie I just ignore them and get on with my life. 

Honestly though, in my experience, few people are genuinely judgemental. It usually comes down to a combination of surprise and an inability to relate to your interests/lifestyle. I find that it helps to frame your goals or accomplishments in a way that makes sense to them. Currently, I make quilts in my spare time. When others share career information, I align this with my quilting. I'm working to advance, I just completed this one, I'm preparing this one to sell, I'm considering opening a shop, ect. 

Sorry for the wall of text! I hope this helps! "
"I've done this a few times.  The first time was as a freshman in HS, chopped off a foot.  Everyone just said how cute it was.


In college I did the same thing, she kept asking me if I was sure I wanted that much chopped off, I told her yes, and it freaked her out I was so calm about it.  I actually had to reassure her, ""It's just hair, it'll grow back""


I'm tall and broad anyway, but I have an hourglass figure.  I've gotten called Sir a few times, but it's whatever.  I just politely correct them.  No issues on other relationships.


Third time I chopped it all off was after SO jokingly forbade me from doing it.   Me being a shit immediately went the next day w/o telling them, and set up my phone to record their reaction.  But they passed the test with flying colors.  First words out of their mouth were ""you cut your hair! It's cute"" then ""ARE YOU RECORDING MY REACTION!? WHAT DID YOU THINK I WOULD DO!?"" and we had a good laugh.
The lady at the salon asked me why I was cutting it all off, and I told her SO had forbidden it, and she goes ""You are my favorite person of the day.""  The guy in the chair next to me whipped around and looked scandalized.

"This is one of my biggest weaknesses-- I used to make fun of my mom for crying so easily (like at a baptism at church), but now I find myself crying when I'm frustrated, hungry, or even when I hear a beautiful song. 

When I'm in a position or situation where I know that I should not be crying, I try and separate myself from what I'm crying about. I'm naturally really empathetic and I have to pretend that I'm just really stoic. I'll think to myself that what I'm crying about isn't actually happening to me, or anyone I know. I have to take away that personal aspect of why I'm crying. For example, I'll imagine that I just read a fictional book where x happened, and yes it's sad but it really has no effect on me. 

If I've already started to cry, well there goes all hope. You can read that on my face from a mile away. Hope this helps!"

"You need to cut her some slack. One of my awful coworkers, a young dude, ended up having sex with one of my other co-workers, also young, single, and already a mom. He went from praising her goddess like figure to braying like a donkey about what a dumb slut she was within a month. Because apparently that's how he acts when people are nice to him. It was one of those moments where yeah, you'd heard people could be like this but you didn't think they'd actually be that shitty oh hey, no, there he goes. Wow. Can't even keep the thought to himself and be cool. Nope. Has to go through the entire staff, having conversations, looking for opportunities to put her name and ""slut"" in the same sentence. Just what an incredible douche. He was so *proud* of himself, too, for fucking her and then trashing her. She was really nice to everyone, and didn't deserve any of that shit. 

Though I kinda want to smack her for even touching his awful, greasy little peen. I wouldn't though. She doesn't deserve anything but him kissing her dainty feet. She's moved on, though. New dude. Doesn't work there anymore. She's ok. God that douche is just bullshit. Like internet legend douchebro people-like-this-aren't-real grade bullshit about it.

I hit puberty like a brick wall. I went from looking like a little girl to having D cup breasts and curves within about 2 months. It happened early (12) and my father handled it very badly. I know he didn't mean it this way, I know it was just awkward for him to suddenly have his little girl have giant boobs, but from my perspective something happened to my body that I didn't choose and couldn't control and suddenly my father turned cold. Right when the whole world started treating me differently because of my body (creepy stares, everybody discussing what I could and couldn't wear, people finding excuses to make me run or jump) I really NEEDED my home to be a place where I could just be a kid again. But no- I had breasts, and as a result, I couldn't count on my fathers affection anymore.  I suddenly viewed my body as this hideous THING that would practically burn a persons eyes out if gazed on because of how he would freak out if he saw me wrapped in a towel leaving the shower. It hurt. That was over a dozen years ago, and I still haven't forgotten. It changed my relationship with him. I was a daddy's girl, and now I'm closer with my mom and this is pretty much why.

"Preparing for downvotes...

I went to catholic school and studied world religions a bit throughout.  Theology was one of my favourite classes. My memory is rusty but I do not believe that Islam is deserving of the negative connotations it has. I would absolutely not judge anyone for converting if they're doing it for the right reasons. I think there's a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings about what Islam is, and even though I studied it in high school, I have no issue with any true Muslims - just radicals (including those who impose strict laws on women). 

I have met Imams and been to mosques and stayed with very kind Muslims. I grew up around Muslims in school, at work, and in various volunteering positions. In my city, everyone comes from a different background. You do not understand the reality of what a religion is looking from the outside. In my community I have spent time with Hindus, Atheists, Christians of many denominations, and Muslims and I have never once felt like I should judge someone for their beliefs. Islam is not a ""bad"" religion. It is based around the same God as Christianity and Judaism. It is literally an Abrahamic religion. It recognizes Jesus. I might get down voted for saying this but really they're not all so different,  different sides of the same coin. It is only how the religion is interpreted that makes Islam seem so bad. No religion teaches you to be a bad person. They all generally follow the same kind of message and want you to do good. 

Though this may seem hard to believe now, the Quran actually has passages that recognize equality between men and women in the eyes of God. It is more culture than religion that imposes beliefs that women are lesser than men in Islamic countries, but they use religion as an excuse. 

For all of those who would disapprove of your children joining Islam, take some time out of your day, if it ever should come, to visit a Mosque. Muslims are incredibly charitable people, and must donate a portion of their salary to charity. Often, they will serve free food for the poor and have doors open to people who are respectful to their rules (no shoes, for example). Muslims are not inherently bad people. Do not assume that a religion is bad because of it... There is more to a religion beyond what you see and what you read in the news about terrorists and radicals and extremists.

"Haha, well it's not terribly interesting while also being kinda long. Hindsight is obviously, always, 20/20. When I was young I had crushes only on guys, but they were always somewhat feminine or from a distance could have been mistaken for a soft butch woman. I didn't realize this then or anything, I just thought that was my type or whatever. 

In high school I pretty much completely stopped noticing men, but I thought I was just picky or because they treated me badly, that I was wary of them. Butch women are my *only* type hands down, but I was never exposed to them and because of that was never able to actually explore my sexuality. It's like I had glimpses here and there but the full picture was obscured for me. So I was bi (or at least I thought I was bi), and my first crush on a girl was probably the worst thing for me ever. Fucking high school, I swear. I thought she was straight, I thought I was creepy for liking her, I felt unworthy of attention from women, etc etc etc. I hated myself for how I felt not for the act of being bi/gay, but for having feelings I believed would never be reciprocated by anyone. But I so desperately wanted to get to know her and to be loved and wanted by a woman. I didn't though, I kept my sexuality a secret.

Now obviously I was very, very insecure as a teen and met a guy who told me all the right things and I guess I convinced myself that I loved him and that he loved me, and I married him a year later at 19. And I just kind of....accepted that that was my life? I didn't hate sex, I didn't feel repulsed by him romantically, it was incredibly decent for a while (separately from my sexuality, he was manipulative and emotionally abusive and that marriage should never have happened). But I craved a woman's love and attention soooo....shortly after marrying him I was tormented by the fact I married a man, I was living my life with a man, what the fuck was I doing, what do I do. Also because of his abuse, I believed he was the best I could do and that no one would ever love or want me, regardless of gender. It was like a double whammy. 

In the end I stayed for six years until last year when I couldn't take it anymore, I came out, and he and I are divorcing. I have a girlfriend and everything feels right and the way it's supposed to be, but I do feel some regret and sadness for my high school self when I wish I could have known I was gay and came out then.

"My dad and I have never been close, so it's odd to me that he gave me my best advice, but he was driving me back to college and I was complaining about the boy I was seeing at the time. I was explaining how he would flake out on plans we had, constantly try to do things to make me jealous and just generally treat me like shit, but that I felt like we had an amazing intellectual connection and he could be so good blah blah blah. My dad, without taking his eyes off the road just said ""you know what they call someone with just a little bit of leprosy? A leper."" It was such a my dad thing to say, and that's stuck with me every time someone hasn't treated me how they should."
"""You'll be glad when you're old"" in regards to me getting carded for beer at 27. If I'm already tired of being mistaken for a child,  why would I be happier about it after 20+ more years of being mistaken for a child?"
This happens a lot less nowadays unless you post in literally any /r/askreddit thread that's labeled nsfw.
I mean if I'm not happy with you I'm not going to want to have sex with you but it shouldn't be withheld as hostage???
"My sister and I are black, and the answer is most definitely.  We live and work in mostly white areas, and while I did have a problem with it, I don't much care any more.  But it's a big problem with my sister, where she doesn't receive nearly the same amount of male attention as her white friends, and it's been that way all her life.  She was never seen as the prettiest or most dateable, and even her uglier and fatter white friends got boyfriends and spouses, and she has a lot of self esteem issues because of it, worrying if it's because she's inherently not good enough to be competing with these white women.

The biggest problem is that people think things like, ""I'm just not attracted to black girls"" exist in some sort of bubble, but, again, this is an issue my sister has faced (and I also have faced) for her entire life, and I know that she's not the only black girl to feel the same way.  She's about medium skin tone, but I am noticeably lighter, and I received different assumptions because of it.  I wasn't seen as attractive, but ""exotic"" because I was ""half-white"" (I am NOT).  But my darker skinned friends have just been looked over completely.

It's a shit situation."
"Mine told me I had a spark and a sunny persona that others are drawn too which was lovely to hear. 

He also cuddled my butt and gave it a massage telling me it was perfect. (it's far from perfect but he makes me feel like it is!)

I have to add a particular favourite from a little while ago..post sex when he held my face, kissed me and with a sigh said, ""one day babe, I'm going to marry the fuck out of you.""
I love how he said it.  I thought it was beautiful and the ultimate compliment!"
"The guy who had a wife and two daughters and wanted to know if women really needed to wipe because he was fighting with his wife about how much toilet paper they went through. He got really defensive about it when people were like ""uh yeah we need to wipe"" and insisted that he thought we could shake it off like a penis. Turned out he thought we peed from the clit but??? That still doesn't explain how we could shake that off?? "

If it's good and I go back, I'll branch out."
"Books. I read super fast, and I get really caught up in a series, and they get you by making the first book on Amazon like $.99 and then each one after that is like $7, and the last one is $14 because it's still only out in hard cover, and the next thing I know, I've blown $40 in two days reading through a really killer series that I just couldn't put down!"

"""Life is tough, but so is swimming! If grad school were easy, everyone would do it!"" -drunk girl at a bar on campus where I stopped for dinner and learned that we were both finishing our theses in different fields with different hurdles.

Reminded me that certain things are really hard, but they're supposed to be. If it were easy, it wouldn't be so rewarding. Hearing her problems with her thesis reminded me that everyone struggles and that there are similarities in everyone's story. Never saw her again, but well-wishes from afar, Tricia!"

"He thinks he knows everything and condescendingly tries to tell me how to do my job. He acts overly familiar with people and refers to everyone by nicknames he made up. He tells the same old annoying jokes every day - for example, if someone asks him ""hey can you come do this?"" he responds with ""NEGATORY! DO NOT WANT!"" If someone drops something or trips, etc. he yells ""EPIC FAIL!"" When he wants to buy something, he comes up to my register, shoves his card in the machine, and says ""Let me speak to your manager!"" He went to Cuba once as part of a school trip and never shuts up about it. Literally relates everything to it, and tells everyone about it on a daily basis.

I actually feel kinda bad for him because I think he's just really socially awkward and and wants to be friends with us, and he is good at his job, but damn does he get on my nerves."
Your poor dad hahahah
"I have to think that many posters on here are teenage/ young 20s, so they may not see just how creepy this situation is because from their perspective it is normal to be attracted to girls in their own age range. If these are grown-ass men arguing that, it's just gross. I mean either way it's gross to sexualize teenage girls, especially without their knowledge or consent."
"Ironically, one of their top posts right now is talking about how you have to be a violent psychopath to get women interested in you. If that was the case I'm pretty sure half the guys on that sub would have girlfriends already."

"I've been a SAHM for 5 years now, but I think there are some valid criticisms coming from people who don't give domestic work equal weight to working for a living. 

For one, I don't think every choice a woman makes is a feminist choice. Feminism has historically been about subverting a power structure in which women are controlled by and dependent on men. I don't agree with people who say that women who voluntarily enter into that power structure are making a feminist choice; they're making a choice that might be right for them but it has nothing to do with feminism.

Secondly, with the exception of the intensive childrearing demands of very young babies and toddlers, or people who have full-time paid help, domestic work is work that most people do in their spare time *in addition to* having a job. So I don't think it's fair to draw an equivalence between a homemaker/SAHP vs. someone who works full-time while still caring for a home and/or children. The workloads are really not comparable, and I say that as someone who has had ample experience doing both.

But those two things don't make domesticity *wrong.* Indeed, pretty much everyone's goal is to one day retire and have that exact job. So (almost) everyone agrees that a lifestyle of not working all day is desirable, why should anyone be concerned that you decided to do that at a young age instead of an old age? What is inherently wrong, immoral, or shameful about that?"

"That definitely happens there, but so often people bury the lede in their posts. Like the post will be ""My boyfriend wants to paint our bedroom blue and I want to paint it pink what do we do?!?!"" And you'll read through four paragraphs of irrelevant drivel and then the last couple sentences are ""Oh, and we started dating when I was 15 and he was 40. He is addicted to heroin, hits me, and got my sister pregnant. Idk if that's relevant"" "
"I've been living by myself for a year now, but something I always wanted was all-white towels and dishtowels, and all matching plastic and glass containers. And no more mess on the bathroom counter and shelves: only the necessary, the rest can go where it's not seen."

"I'd add: treat other women how you'd want the rest of the world to treat her.  Many men treat their wives and daughters as ""special"" while still saying awful things about other women. 

For example, my Dad frequently called me pretty and emphasized the importance of hard work and intelligence. However, he constantly insults other women based on their appearance..even women like Supreme Court Justices.  I have told him that I've met and seen various high-level people working in DC. The first thing he *always* asks about women is ""How does she look in real life?  She looks ____ on TV."" 

It effected my perception of my own looks and personal value growing up, and still makes me angry and sad to witness. "

"My journey to figuring out that I was ""a lesbian"" was rather weird and rather atypical. (I say that in quotes because I'm more of a gynephilac than anything. ""Pan with a hard preference"" so to speak.)

I dated boys in high school (though you could hardly call it dating) but we never did anything aside from holding hands. No kissing, rarely hugging and NO sexual contact. I was just uncomfortable with the idea of penises. (Still have yet to see one in real time in front of me either.)

So as college came...I started to think I was just asexual and was fine with that idea as it never occurred to me to consider girls. And for about three years, that's how I classified myself. Even dated a few guys that way. (I was a heteroromantic.)

But I still felt off...and couldn't really explain it. So one day as I'm driving somewhere with the bestie and I talking about it (she accepted all of the reclassifications without question) and she said ""maybe you're just gay?""

IT WAS LIKE A DAWNING OF SEXUAL COMPREHENSION. I literally said to her ""holy shit. That's right, I can date girls too, can't I?""

Went on my first date with one only two weeks later and haven't gone back since. My first kiss was with a girl, first time...all of it. (Although I have dated a few transsexuals as being femme or andro mattered more to me than strict gender alone.)

I finally felt right and just took forever to figure it out."
That you pledge allegiance to the flag every day in school??? To me it feels very culty! I thought it was just something they did in the movies until I became friends with an American. Totally wild to me. 
"One of the things I learned in my 20s and never heard before was how painful breastfeeding can be. I don't think it's very common (or my friends who breastfed got really lucky) but it never occurred to me it could be seriously painful. I even heard ""It's more painful than childbirth"" from a mother."
"I visit relationship advice often and you wouldn't believe how common it is for the first 15 replies to a guy asking for advice on a problem with his gf be: she sounds fucking unstable and mentally ill, dump her ass now before you regret it later. "

Idk what other people think but I find the whole 'upvoted because girl' or 'initially upvoted because girl but blah blah blah' kinda annoying and patronizing. But maybe I'm sensitive. 
"Preference for circumcised dicks. Not saying there's anything wrong with them, but the idea that uncut is ""weird"" or ""dirty"" is so pervasive here. 

FWIW I've tried both and there is absolutely no difference. I guess uncut is more fun to play with because there's more to do but in terms of like actual feeling when having sex, it's impossible to tell the difference. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Edit: sigh, I was trying to avoid exactly this discussion because every time I say I like uncut better I get a million angry Americans screaming at me. I just can't win."
"Such good advice. The relationship between you and your partner is going to be her first look into what a relationship should look like. Try and hug and kiss your wife in front of her so she knows affection is okay, don't get into screaming matches in front of her but don't be afraid to argue with your partner in a constructive manner in front if her, compliment eachother in front of her. "
"I met a girl kind of like this. Beautiful woman, 30 or 31 years old. She thought sex was kind of a favor to do for her man. (She only had a couple of partners before getting married very young, and never strayed from her husband. Her first post-divorce experience was very underwhelming too)
When we finally did it, I made damn sure to give her the time of her life. Apparently it worked. I've never had a partner so grateful for how I made her feel. She made me feel like a God,  I'm just glad I could show her a new part of life that she didn't know how to enjoy."
How you react to fights: do you resolve them or let them go unresolved? Resolution strategy is very important to a healthy relationship. 
"LISTEN to her instead of dismissing her ambitions and dreams as funny or cute. My dad and brothers and grandfathers never took me seriously because I am a girl and they always kinda assumed I'd change my mind from wanting to be a paramedic, and go into nursing. Or I'd quit wanting to do sports, ""you can't be successful in sports, girls hit like girls after all!"", or I'd only be interested in makeup and that I'd give all of the above up when I became a mother. That disrespect continues to this day despite proving them all wrong and is a major contributor as to why I don't have a relationship with any of them. No one should have to rebuild her own confidence after a lifetime of having it broken by the men in her life and it happens all too often. "

"I've known her for years and I can't name one thing she really likes. She's just kind of ""meh"" about everything. She whines often about the guy she's marrying, her weight, her friends, but does nothing to fix her situation, which are all completely within her control. She is, for lack of better word, underwhelming and it comes through in her conversations and general affect"
"Shaving with the grain is the wooooorrrrst because the razor just slides over most of the hair that way, and then I have to give it way more passes, which causes more bikini bumps. Using an electric shaver gets a closer shave than that, and though it's less close than shaving against, it doesn't give me any razor bumps so I would never ever go back."

There's also a saying that homophobia is a man's fear of being treated the same way he treats women. 
"My wife was extremely happy she put her foot down and hired a ""day of coordinator"", like a wedding planner except they just show up the day of and..coordinate everything. I didn't get it really but went along with her choice, and in retrospect it made a ton of sense. She made sure everyone else was doing their job, did random menial tasks herself like carrying chairs and setting up the place settings etc. etc. And she only charged $500 or so. 

We've gone to two other weddings since then and both were really stressful for the bride trying to organize everything themselves.

Personally I think while ""splurging"" is the wrong word, picking a good photographer / DJ / caterer / officiant is pretty important too. We tried to hire good reputable people and while they weren't the cheapest everything turned out really great and we didn't regret spending the money."
"Hate hearing this sentiment in all its forms on reddit. 

""Just appease your wife in every way possible, give in to her dumb and ridiculous demands, and never compromise on anything."" First of all, why would you put up with a relationship like that? Second, quit it with the whole ""lol women are shrill nagging harpies all the time amirite?"""
"Organic.

Nope. It was during the slow season for us (shitty retail store) and no one else took vacation days that week. The manager was just bitter and terrible to everybody.

"a post on relationships where a girl was asking for advice about how to tell her BF to wear smaller condoms because they kept coming off when they were having sex. He had gone so far as to REFUSE to wear a smaller condom, and I could not believe how many people were more concerned with placating this jerk's ego around his dick size than with OP possibly getting an STD or pregnant because her BF couldn't admit his dick was smaller than he wanted it to be. I don't give a shit about anyone's ego when someone else's bodily integrity is on the line."

Right. So many young girls in third world countries are harmed severely by the childbirth process because they were too young and too small.

"I became happy.

I was depressed for most of my teens/early twenties. All I wanted to do was be unconscious. Nothing had meaning and I hated myself. I had no self worth. By the time I was 21 I could feel the depression lifting. By 23 it was almost gone completely and when it did happen I was able to recognize it as something my brain was doing, not the actual state of my life. It was a combination of meds, therapy, solo travel and starting my career that did it. I learned how to take care of and stand up for myself and to find pleasure in things even when they weren't perfect. I'm so much happier than I ever thought I could be. I hope that the older I get, the happier I become. "
"Some of the contouring that looks fantastic on Instagram looks freaky weird IRL. 

Also now that the 90s are back, that means the post-90s shame is also going to kick in about a decade later.

"I guess I've never seen ""biological"" as a differentiating factor. My cousin was adopted, and so were some classmates. I never saw them as being any less connected to their families. 

I'm also biracial and don't look shit like my biological dad, so the whole ""looking different"" thing is a non-issue. Many biological families don't look a thing alike.

I wanted kids but really didn't want to carry (had health issues my whole life which are at risk of being triggered by trauma to the body), so my wife did. She really liked the idea of reciprocal IVF (my egg, her uterus) so we went that route. I wasn't fussy about it being my egg or hers... the child would have been equally ""mine"" either way. But she really wanted to do it that way. I'm honestly relieved that I get to have a child without going through pregnancy. My wife is my hero. 

We're considering adoption next, and won't see the kid as any different from the one made with our egg and carried in our womb.

Think of it this way, if you suddenly found out your mom hadn't actually carried you - that you were adopted, or she used a surrogate - would you consider her any less your mother?"
