"I dated a girl in high school for a period of about two weeks. One day this girl was eating a burrito and I asked what kind it was. She says, ""It's meat."" I then reply, ""What kind of meat?"" She repeats, ""It's meat."" Growing annoyed, I ask, "" Is it beef, chicken, or pork?"" This bitch repeats ""It's meat!"" For the third time. She truly believed ""meat"" was different from beef or any other kind of meat. What the fuck.

Edit: Sorry boys, this just can not be justified. This girl is a native English speaker raised in the US. The question was narrowed to beef, chicken, and pork to no avail. The official def. of meat is roughly the flesh of any animal. The burrito turned out to be carne asada. "
Yeah he's def not in the tres commas club. His car doors open normally(lame)
