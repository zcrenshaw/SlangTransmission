"I would have been disappointed if you **hadn't** locked his keys in his car after he refused to pay.

Good on you for standing your ground. "
"&gt; I didn't tell him, but they charge $100 to unlock cars

I was about to say, $40 sounds too generous to unlock a car"
"&gt;the three of us 

Excellent."
It's not like you can accidentally place a phone in a microwave either.
So how was jail?
"I have a quick little story that makes this more hilarious. 

I move about a few of the different branches of the dvd store in which I work, due to being the awesomely experienced person that I am. So it's not unusual for me to be in three different locations within a week. 

Recently, I had three separate customers complain I was following them around the city and watching what they bought. I tried to explain I just get sent where I'm needed but they weren't having it!"
"&gt;About 5 minutes later she walks back in without saying a word, picks up the key, and leaves. But not before my dad chimed in with a ""have a nice day!""

This is where a fourth character wearing a top hat, monocle and broom-handle mustache would have sealed the deal.

"
So there is this lady who is paid to do the shopping for someone and wants you to do the actual shopping? 
"Most public servants will not do this anymore, and are generally instructed not to. People would ask cops to help them open their car, and then bill the city for scratches or dents. "
"I would like to return this bottle of soda! I bought it two years ago, and the burping made me mad.

Gimme money."
"I was hoping for: ""I'll have to charge you for two service calls, and an extra out of hours charge."" "
That's one high motherfucker... sorta wonder how he got to the store in the first place.
Your dad though my goodness. Best attitude ever!
"It took ten seconds because you know what you're doing and he doesn't, that's also why you have to pay for services, skilled vs unskilled."
If you call your city's non emergency number they can usually send a community officer to jimmy the car open for free.
"""Thats right, you come down here and kick my ass, I dare you.  In fact, you do that, I'll pay you double!  And here's my address:  Acme locksmith, 123 across town street...."""
"My city cops don't unlock it, but they do give you the number of a locksmith who gives discounts if you mention they sent you to him."
"Best. Response. Ever!

Actually, If you've ever seen or used the ""Shop Disney Parks"" app, you've seen where all of my free time went."
"Yeah pretty much. Someone paid her to shop, so she came to us and asked us to bring her all of the items. Unfortunately, that's not quite how grocery stores work. "
"I got mine done for $40 once, cash. However, as a stupid teenager, I had gotten him out there by calling my insurance company, because my mom's insurance covered roadside assistance. 

Yeah, that guy got paid twice. He just popped the door open, said, ""That'll be $40,"" and left. I'm sure if I mentioned the insurance company paying him already, he would have just played dumb, like, ""Oh, right, I forgot."" I didn't even think about it until the next year when I did the same thing, tried to pay the (different) locksmith, and he kindly turned down my money. "
"I would've, but we advertise 24/7 service, so we don't charge any extra for night or weekend calls"
"&gt; How do people manage to even find their way to my store?

It's a form of chaos theory I think.  You take a large number of customers all moving around randomly.  They bounce off of each other and objects.  Eventually one walks through the door.

Seriously, it's all random chance."
"I've had several deaf transactions. It is glorious. Our registers no longer show totals to the customer, so I write the total on a post it note. I also say ""thank you"" by touching my hand to my chin, one of the only ASL signs I know. "
"It's the ""neither"" that truly makes it art."
"My very tired brain begs to differ. When attempting to make breakfast one morning, I managed to put the phone in the microwave and the frozen breakfast bowl thing to my ear. Luckily the cold jolted me awake and I didn't hit start."
We don't know what that dog was thinking. Totally could have been a pervert dog. One of those dogs you see on Dateline. 
"&gt; So we did our version of kicking someone out, aka everyone walked away and ignored her.  

I can just picture her fuming that her tantrum is being ignored."
"I bought a sandwich here 15 years ago when a different company owned this building. It was delicious, I want a full refund and another sandwich from that company. You have to serve me tehe"

I hate spineless managers. This only encourages the behavior and other retail employees have to suffer for it.
"Also, it was 10 seconds *plus the time it took to drive there and back*."
Fucking savage
"Seriously, FUCK people like that! I too would've been upset if he didn't do that. "
"Blimey. He's not just high, he's on a completely different planet. Does being high give you a hangover? If it does I'd hate to be him the next day. "
"I've been saying that for years - How in the hell did that person successfully get in a car and drive themselves here?

The dumbass is strong in many customers.

"Super big pet peeve when people say ""You are going to do this and then you will do this...."" NO asking, no politeness, just assuming that you will drop to your knees and do whatever their bidding is."
"He's pretty sassy when people deserve it, it's great"
"I know what you mean, but my heaven was being scheduled in the back and not having to deal with customers unless they asked me a question when I had to go out onto the floor to get items for online orders &lt;3 Loved every minute of it."
Some of us Deaf people are certain this is not a coincidence.
I don't get people. Why even ask if you know the answer? -eyeroll intensifies- 
You should've given him those candy cigarettes 
"""Then why should I give a fuck about you and doing you a favor?"""
"Now I'm remembering standing on my back porch after a LONG day at work clicking my key fob to open the back door.  It works great on my car, not so much on my house!"
Make sure it doesn't go under your chin or else you're signing fuck you ðŸ˜³
"""hey, do I have a *sweet* deal for you!""

Edit: aspace"
DVD store? Those don't exist where I am anymore 
You're in retail. You'll learn to never laugh again soon enough.
I'm hoping she or her husband or a child put it in there by accident and just did something stupid
"&gt;My guess was to dread whatever punishment awaited.  

Probably beat him with ~~jumper~~ charger cables when he got out to the car. Poor kid."
"I was pissed. I wanted to punch the dude, but that's obviously not smart when you've got 3 cameras watching you. Lol"
Well dang now I wish I would've been thinking
I worked for AAA recently. That was their policy for lockouts where they can't prove it is their car or if it was a cash call (member already used all 4 of their annual service calls service can be sent out but must be paid for) and they refused to pay. Service provider will lock it back up.
"Some insurance companies pay us directly, some reimburse the customer, but the latter is pretty rare. If you have roadside assistance on your insurance then they should cover it, and usually they call us themselves."
"Same! And she kept repeating that she just got off work, like that somehow made her circumstances an exception! You just left work so you can't download Facebook? Uhhhhh.... What?"
"I honestly think she just wanted an upgrade. She seemed persistent with getting a replacement (pushed for an upgrade). Since the whole blowing up phone thing, I think she thought the company would just be like ""sure just give her everything!!!"""
"Seems like the guy needed a dose of reality. Nothing in life is free, pal."
"well everyone knows that the mystical ""back"" is where you horde all the good stuff just so customers can't have it."
"&gt;Her most recent script for that product is two years old. She had a $0 copay. 

Ok.. I'll return it for you. (take box and give her no money)"
"&gt; can't you just uncut the key.

""Sure! Let me just get out my portable smelting oven and refinery here.""

People like this make me lose faith in humanity."
Might have been trying to charge it.

"I've experienced the same with a relative coming in to visit his aunt.
""My aunt works at &lt;insert chain department store&gt;!""

""Well, we don't know anyone by that name here. Are you sure she works at this location?""

""There's more than one &lt;department store!&gt;?""

""Why, yes, we have 200+ locations"" *shows him store list*

After a bit of digging we worked out he wasn't even in the right state lmao."
You did punch him in two of the three main places where it would hurt the most - his wallet and his ego/pride.
"Never, ever give a customer your last name. They absolutely do not need it for anything good, and I bet you that there is no company policy forcing you to do so."
I *love* when stoners come into my store to get cash back in the middle of the night. For some reason they always end up forgetting to get cash back the first and second time so they end up with like 4 or 5 little candy bars just to withdraw 5 dollars to round off their gram. Stoners are probably the only reason my store makes any money being open in the middle of the night. 
"I had a regular that kind of irritated me. I am not a chatty person, but being flat out ignored is a bit annoying. When she would talk to me, she would be very loud and would often ignore follow up questions if I didn't understand her. She wasn't a bad customer or anything, but she annoyed me more often than not.

Fast forward a year and I see her walking in on a day I'm not feeling so great, so I say ""I hope you get her"" to my co-worker. My co-worker asks ""Who? Customer's Name?"". I look blankly at her and say I have no idea because I never really learn names unless the regulars insist on telling me them so she asked if I meant the deaf lady.

I felt pretty foolish."
"I know the rules say not to, but can I post to Express Checkout with a really long story that doesn't belong there?

It's okay though, because the main section was full of long stories and I didn't want to wait.

I'll just post it here..."
"what an asshat. what did he think he was going to get for causing a scene, brownie points? turkey points??"
"I have a friend who used to be a manager at a brestaurant.  She's 4'7 and maybe 75lbs.  Also Native Hawaiian.  We're in the Midwest; the clientele were often big Nordic guys.

  Boy, the ones that she ""helped"" outside would have loved to know before hand that she also teaches Kendo, Judo, and Krav Maga.

  Watched her work once.  Guy wanted another pitcher, number 5.  Waitress said no.  He patted her on the backside and suggested that she get it anyways.  My friend saw this.  Asked him to pay his tab and leave.  He said he would when he felt like it and went back to his beer.  She handed off his food to be boxed.  He slapped at her hand.  ""Don't do that.""  He patted her on the head and told her to bother someone else.  As he realized he was on the floor, she asked him if she should call the cops or if he'd leave peacefully.  No cops were called.

TL;DR: Don't piss off the little ones."
