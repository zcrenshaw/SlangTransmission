so this is a weird AskReddit question...
"But... the teacher wasn't wrong.

The likelyhood of having a brown eyed baby from blue eyed parents is less than 1%. Essentially negligible. 

Google it. Its possible, sure, just highly unlikely. Ridiculously unlikely.

As in: You have as good a chance of having siemiese twins as you do of having a blue eyed baby from brown eyed parents.

So, really, he isn't wrong. Your teacher could say: ""None of you will every have siemiese twins"" to every class he ever teaches, over the span of a career, and still have a good chance of being 100% accurate.

The same could be said for the genetics of eye color regarding blue eyed parents and a brown eyed child.

Sure... its possible. Same can be said for winning the lottery. About the same odds."

"Vice versa,  Why should I be inconvenienced because you hate the smell?  Do you frown at farmers when you smell cow shit too?"
It's still the end piece of the human centipede of the internet. 
"""Ottomans conquered Europe"" They only controlled the Balkans and Hungary.."
"Oh, whoops. I misread it. By the way dude, what's with the overt aggressiveness? It was just a mistake. "
When did I say that? All I did was voice my opinion.
So you're in a very inhospital place with little food but no one dares try the beans until one guy sees it makes his goats hyper?
What point are you trying to prove? That nurses are nurses? 
You just stepped in dog poop.
"I know but the ones who die young are usually always very talented with even more potential with the years they would have had ahead of them, like the ones you listed"
Well if ya knew how to drive an awd car then you won't end up in a ditch like a bitch.

"Lol @ GoP smear shit. 

Trump is arguably more progressive than hillary, but you like most of america fell for DNC smear shit. Hillary may have said nice words about progressive ideas, but she'll say anything to further her career, who the fuck knows what she actually believes. 

&gt;But he hates women.

Trump tower NYC was built by a woman. In fact, the first woman to lead a major construction project in NYC

&gt;But trump hates black people

This is based off of a quote taken completely out of context and framed to make him look racist. Politicians speak in soundbytes to avoid shit like this. Plus I have yet to see anything resembling proof of this that's more recent than the video of hillary saying marriage is one man one woman.

&gt;But... But trump hates immigrants

Trump wants to deport illegals but has no issues against people who came here legally. He also only said he wanted increased screening for muslim immigrants, where Obama signed into law indefinite detention without charge or trial (direct violation of the 5th and 6th amendments) with almost no flak to combat the same problem."

Why do you feel the need to show so much hate and disgust for Christianity yet give Islam a pass? 
"I actually really liked Parks and Rec, once they got rid of Brendanawitz and Andy stopped stalking Anne. It even started to go uphill before then. They Flanderized every character on the show that they possibly could, though, to the point of caricature, especially the main characters. That was Leslie's whole gimmick, but it wasn't necessary to do it to Ron, Jerry, Ben, Chris, April and the dude from sanitation as well. I blame Ron Swanson memes. B99 is just not funny."
Worst case Ontario*
"You are assuming I think an intelligent person can't be racist?   Randomly flinging out fallacies that don't actually apply, to an argument I didn't make?  The 'fallacy' fallacy? Yikes, this whole post is just overflowing with emotion and a complete lack of critical thought.  My Trump comment was as much a poke at people who say he's smart and not racist as much as it was an actual belief.  Go cool down and we'll talk some more after, okay?  You'll be alright.  Maybe you can tell me about this Milo person then.

Edit: So you are aware, I'm calling *you* out for using a straw man.  For ad hock and no true scottsman to apply, my argument would have to be ""smart people can't be racist,"" and I would have had to refute you on the basis that your evidence doesn't apply in talking about the existence of smart racists.

You ready for what my argument was?  ""Your post didn't provide the information I'm looking for, here's why and here's more specifically what I want.""  My initial post was a question to better understand a phenomena I hadn't encountered.  You made it an argument."
"Wearing ""muscle"" tank tops at the gym.

"That is a very poorly formed hypothetical. Your response to I-aint-never's hypothesis (as follows)...
&gt;Women will so often mix their yes's and no's making it hard to tell what they truly want.

was to essentially flip the gender roles.
&gt;suppose I date a guy who sends out mixed messages and who gets upset when I don't decipher his meaning.

Simply changing the role of the gender doesn't add anything constructive to the argument. Men and women are both capable of being cryptic or dubious. Therefore, misinterpretation is possible regardless of the gender of your partner (which is a point that applies to I-aint-never's comment as well). 

Furthermore, your list of only two options as a response to your hypothetical scenario is poorly constructed as well. Presenting your A and B circumstance is misleading. Your A response...
&gt;A. Put up with it and attribute that same pattern of behavior to all men?

is illogical. No ethical person would expect anyone to put up with a circumstance with which they were uncomfortable. Nor would they expect you to attribute one personality trait to an entire gender.

Your B response...
&gt;Build enough self-esteem to recognize this guy is toxic, dump him, and look for somebody who has a better head on his shoulders?

would seem to be the better answer to the question. While your B answer still includes extraneous or subjective details, it would be very illogical to choose the A answer over the B answer. The B answer is not wrong, you just presented the B answer as if it were the **only** valid response to your question."
"I've been doing this one thing I think *might* be illegal. I've got like ten people from Craiglist and I want to see if I could make a food system type thing we're they all share one meal. They seem to be hating it. Lots of complaining.

"ok, so will you say the same for assisted suicide, I want to kill myself, cant do it at home because I could make a mistake and end up brain dead, which will in turn cost the state to take care of me.

so do you support assisted suicide for everyone"
Not what he asked. 
Except that all throughout history gender and sex were understood to be the same.....

Still better than what we were given.
"You haven't actually shown anything though, you're just declaring these scenes to have poor dialogue, pacing, and direction."
"I would wish that every progressive who votes or cries for open borders would be forced to indefinitely house a family of immigrants or refugees in there own home. Ohh wait that might actually create common sense, kind of the opposite of chaos. Hmm I'm not really good at this game."
"Well, considering that these sex crimes span the socioeconomic spectrum, whereas what I assume you were getting at (black and brown people) can be readily explained by poverty/low socioeconomic status, it's still pretty fuckin weak. "
Really? I rolled my eyes during the whole scene. Unabashed fan service that actually made no sense in context with the opening scenes of Ep4.
"But if Tony's death *was* supposed to be from his point of view-- if the screen going black is meant to show Tony's POV upon getting killed-- then shouldn't his family have made eye contact with the camera while walking towards him? Again, the argument that Tony was killed relies on the idea that it's from Tony's POV, and yet the scenes are not actually shot from his POV. I think that leaves room for debate.

They set it up perfectly for Tony to die. There was the line a few episodes earlier about not hearing the bullet coming, everything going black-- just like we think happened to Tony-- but they f'd it up with a poorly chosen camera angle."

"The first one was good, but after that they kinda go to shit"
"In all that time watching it, did you ever get that the whole movie is telling you that you are one of the Romans?

It basically is calling out American film audiences as decadent passive viewers who are entertained by violent spectacle.  And then it proceeds to you exactly the violence you crave.

It's one of the biggest middle fingers to an audience I have ever seen.  It boggles my mind that people love it."
This is going to sound brutal and I can understand if I get downvoted but that's pretty selfish. Those extra years will be nothing but a financial burden due to care costs as he gradually deteriorates more and more.

Why though?

"Yeah, well, Family Guy is a bit like the Simpsons. An artifact of it's time of creation, not really funny, and still around only because of some nostalgic fans.

In any rational world it would have been axed a long time ago.

wrong. safe spaces were a real issue between 2014-2015. same with triggers. hearing about it elsewhere had nothing to do with me experiencing it firsthand.
"This misunderstands what cultural appropriation actually refers to. Rather than just copying and pasting, I'll link a previous comment I made on this subject.

"Similar shit could be said about any president. Here, let me try. 

""Obama spent trillions of dollars sending hundreds of thousands of bombs into Libya and Syria, through short sighted, meddling politics, he created the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to rise to the prominence it currently enjoys, persecuted whistleblowers and vastly increased the state's surveillance capabilities, and also disregarded state laws on marijuana regulation and repossessed inventory and profits of legal dispensaries"" 


This is fun. Now try it with Bush. "
The people I know who voted trump are quite ignorant. One guy imitated the chinese restaurant guy from southpark in a chinese buffet. Another older white guy talked about how funny his neighbor is for posting a confederate flag on his lawn. I'm not calling them racist but ignorant and dumb.

"^ this exactly.

If you block traffic and get your guts smeared across the highway you deserved it. Fuck your ""cause"", my two tons of rolling momentum wins that exchange, and bet believe ""oh officers it was a tragedy I spilled my coffee and was distracted because it was so hot that I didn't see those retarded sjw snowflakes until my 65mph car smashed the first half dozen of them."""
"That is not true, though. They can all be true if they all lead to the truth. The stories may be different but they still point to the same truth."
"You have nice rhetoric, but complaining about how the system works wont get you a job. What you describe hasn't been my experience in the work force at all.

There are tons of startups looking to fill positions. Especially if you're a CS graduate! They're looking for people who fit their culture and have a work ethic, not people with years of experience. And these companies don't have the means to rely on nepotism--they'd never make it out of the seed-funding stage with less-than-ideal employees.

Find a company that does something you agree with and contact them. Ask for guidance on the subject or show them a related project you've done. You might not get a job, but you might make a friend. And friends are what you need to get your foot in the door."
Homosexuality 
"Ah yes, the old appeal to ignorance."
"Her boyfriend right now: ""aw fuck yessss"""
"I think we are in agreement. You shouldn't ghost someone just because you don't want to confront the guy or you *think* he will be crazy (when he's shown no signs of that). A lot of girls think ghosting is a neutral act but it's actually rude one. If the guy hasn't been rude to you, don't be the first person to be rude. Just decline politely.

However, if the guy won't take no for an answer or is not handling the rejection well, then yeah, just ignore him. That's not ghosting, that's just ignoring a rude person."
