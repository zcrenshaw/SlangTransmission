I don't need to edit the question.
What was your most rewarding sexual experience?
"My parents died a week ago in a vicious, Russian car crash. I'm only 11 years old and I've been living on the streets ever since. My (also Russian) uncle wants to take me in but I'm scared he'll hurt me again.

Can you give me any thoughtful, caring advice?"
Stayed at home and had a bunch of relatives over
"Damn, girl, are you a Communist? Because you're starting an uprising in my lower class."

How do you feel about the Nazi regime in Germany during WWII?
"Do you strangle cats? If so, how often?"
"In the dead of winter, you are stranded on a polar ice cap. You have been repeatedly anally penetrated by ravenous baby seals and penguins for the last 72 hours. Through the bloody, poo covered, penguin semen haze you see a shadowy figure. It's a large, grizzly looking man. 

He screams to you ""This looks fun, but I'm afraid I have a rule about not raping anybody under the age of 14. How old are you?"" 

What do you say next?

I usually punch something or yell
What's a good way to pick up women in public?

Because they're standing in the middle of the crosswalk when I have a green light
"Here's our convo

(Tobey from across the parking structure) ""Hey we can go up this way. We can go up this way right?""
(me)""yeah you just go up to the roof and walk into the dining room through the door""
(t)""oh alright cool. How's your night going?""
(m)""I'm getting whooped on dude""
(t)""damn well is it almost over?""
(m)""I hope so man""
*Elevator door opens*
(both) ""have a good night""  

Edit: I talked with a co-worker who has an attractive female friend who had hooked up with Leo and had pictures and text convos to back her story up. She said ""he just had me ride him forever while he leaned over doing bumps of coke""  "

"His was pretty forgettable, tbh.  I don't even remember if I completely read it before swiping.  All I saw was that he was interested in Game of Thrones and that was all I needed.

I had recently finished all five seasons (at the time) in a week and I needed a new person to obsess over the show with.

My bio was much better, IMO.

Do you think he would have proposed if you weren't pregnant?
"Yes, very much so. Since beginning as a cashier at 18 years old, to my sous chef promotion at 19 and a half, I've done nothing but find a way to seemingly ""connect"" with people. For instance, I made a personal friendship with the head chef at the restaurant and even loaned him 2500 dollars when his wife went through a horrible medical tragedy. This quickly lead to him teaching me and being comfortable helping me move up in that industry. I never got that money back, but it was a hell of an investment.

I don't like to admit how manipulative I am through every action in my everyday life. I Started as the office bitch here, and i'm now leading my team in infrastructure as an uneducated 22 year old and i know i have absolutely no motivation or qualifications to do what i do.

It's all subconscious, but i've learned to recognize these patterns and i hope to apply this knowledge in a romantic relationship where i can work with my partner to overcome my nature.

"Do you yawn when others around you yawn? (Seriously, there was a story on the front page a couple of days ago that said psychopaths don't)."
"#1 for awesome factor was guiding a young couple in rural Ontario on how to deliver a baby as the ambulance was going to be delayed. After about 40 minutes on the phone (woman was already several hours into a home-birth labour without a doula), baby popped out and wasn't breathing. Dad freaked out and I guided them on how to get the baby breathing (as per protocol). Baby ended up being okay and I got a nice little stork pin to wear on my uniform for it. It was a girl and I jokingly asked if they would name it after me (I'm a boy with a very non-ambiguously male name). They laughed and politely declined.

#1 for horrific factor was listening to the screams of a man burn up in his vehicle that just got into a collision while I was on the phone with a bystander trying to pry him out. (Sorry, hope this doesn't bring anyone down but it's the reality of the job). "
Yes I am.
If you went on a murdering spree who would you start with?
