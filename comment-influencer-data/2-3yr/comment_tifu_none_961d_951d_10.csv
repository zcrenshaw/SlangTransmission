"I avoid the treadmill because I can't run on them gracefully.  The guy next to me is always running smoothly, you hear a near silent *skiff skiff skiff* as his shoes make contact with the belt, when I run it sounds like a retarded dinosaur with two different sized legs going on a dumbass rampage."
I'm imagining somebody trying to perform cpr or the heimlich maneuver on op in this situation. 
"Accident or not, buy your cat a tin of the best food you can afford. He deserves a extra treat. Furry little asshole saved you a hell of a headache. "
"I have a slightly less scary story. One-time I left an upstairs window open while my family were away, I woke up to find my cat on my lap in a sort of ambush position, while also prodding me. Hear some noises in the hall way and on the stairs which run up the wall behind my bed. So I grab my hockey stick and charge out, now I'm like a 5,9 skinny white dude in boxers here. No sure who I was going to intimidate but then I see the rest of our cats all standing their ground together at the bottom of the stairs, in sort of cat wall formation.

I charge up the stairs, turns out there is another massive cat which isn't one of ours. In my still half asleep confused state I yell at it ""what are you doing here!"". Cat then legs it back out the window.

My cat saved me from a home invasion by another cat. 
 
Edit: Wow my first reddit gold! Thank you stranger! 

2nd edit: Sad news I'm afraid, on getting home tonight I have been informed the largest and oldest of the cats in the story, Cleo has been put down. She was a rescue cat and had a hard life but I know she enjoyed her later years. "
"Urine trouble.

edit: thanks you for the golds. its very nice."
just proved to your mom you are still her baby
man I always remember someone asking this in 5th grade sex ed and the teacher said it wasn't possible.
Definitely a strong bond you guys have. That's all I could focus on. 
"Yeah I gotta finish my dailies, collect 30 dicks"
That was actually quite ingenious of you to try to have fun. I can see how 7 year old you wouldn't see that blowing up in your face.

A sex ed teacher said pissing with a boner is impossible? Sounds more than a little underqualified.

""Oh, okay"""
"I lost it at ""that's all for you babe"" "
"That sounds, or would have sounded, just as funny as the initial situation.  Reeeeeeet."

I feel sorry for you but I kinda wish this was captured on video.

"Was expecting you to catch him jacking off, good job keeping me on my toes"

"""I'll just be grinding""... With no context? That could mean anything. I'm surprised no one asked a follow up question, about what exactly that entails. 

Either way, what game are you grinding in? It's been years since I've played a good grinding RPG"
"If you did it as hard as hard as it seems you could have broken her tail or fractured it.

Worth a trip to the vets IMO.

*edit* wow this comment blew up fast... The advice I've given is because if the cat was hiding for as long as op suggested (if the story is real) it could mean that's it's injured and hiding is a reaction to a painful injury as they know they're vulnerable.

Don't quote me on what I'm saying as fact, but as an animal lover and living with an almost 20 year old cat/seen other cat's reaction from being hit by cars that's what I think would explain the long hiding period.

*edit 2* Well I'm glad my now highest rated comment is providing helpful and fairly accurate knowledge to all!

*edit 3* just had a curious moment and checked u/steezykobe's history, 2 year club but no comment karma and only started posting last month... Hopefully he's just a bot building up karma in which case this story is likely fake and no cat was hurt, but don't let that stop with all these comment chain stories as i love reading about your cats/experiences."

I took a step back 

And slammed the door fast

""Yes, you are.  I piss with an erection every morning.""

""You have an erection every morning???""

Yes, dumbass.  I'm a teenager.  My hormones are fucking RAGING.

She lost a bunch of my labs and made me redo them.  Then, when she lost them AGAIN, and tried to get me to redo them again, I refused.  She also called and left a message on a Saturday night at 10:30pm drunk as a fucking skunk about me not doing my homework and failing tests.

"So one time I was having a party with a lot of friends and family, and we were playing cards against humanity and my mom was playing with us. I forget what the subject card was but my mom played the queefing card. When I read it it didn't make any sense whatsoever, and then my mom was like ""yes it does! That's the game Harry Potter plays!"" I had to tell my mom ""no, that's quidditch. Queefing is a pussy fart...."" My mom's jaw dropped lol"

"Every night, right before I go to bed, I take my dog out to see if he has to do some business because being woken up in the middle  of the night sucks. 

Anyways, I always lock the door right after I take him out and head up to bed, so he knows the schedule by now. Last week, I forgot to lock the door, and he stood in the living room and barked at me until I did it. 

That dog is going to save my life some time."

"Had a friend in high school who could lay on her back and make her self queef. We were 14/15 and thought she was just making her self fart. My Aunt walked through the door as she was doing this and gave us the weirdest look and started laughing her ass off. When I asked what was so funny she said ""That's not farting girls, she's making her 'who-who'(my aunt doesn't like the word pussy) fart."" My friend got up and left real quick after that. The funny part was it was so loud! You could actually hear the air being sucked inside and then expelled. I still don't understand how my friend couldn't tell her ass from her pussy! "

a little BACKstory for you
"Wow, very scary indeed. Glad everything ended up working out and that cat should get some extra treats! I had something similar happen. We have a dog run on the side of our house, completely fenced in with no gate to the fence, the only way into/out of the run is by an actual door on the side of our house. We rarely lock it as someone would have to fight their way through the tree line that runs along the run and then climb a 6 foot fence and then come in all without my very large dog noticing and alerting us...impossible, right? Nope. The door in question is in a playroom we dedicated to our kids. One night, I'm walking over their sleeping bags (fake sleepover that they just had to have) and letting the dog out to do his business. As I open the door, I am face to face with someone. They dog took off after them and I proceeded to scream like a banshee. They were caught, however, bc they broke their arm trying to get through the treeline and confessed to the ER nurse. Scary stuff. Now it's locked and we put a security light out there too. "
Fart stuff as well. Me and my wife regularly fart on each other

"Played Cards Against Humanity with my sons and their friends: 15, 16, 17 &amp; 18.  One of them plays a queef card and they all cackle wildly, high fiving and general ""bruh""ing all around.  So, being a terrible, evil mom, I ask, ""do any of you actually know what that means?""  The table gets immediately quiet and they all glance at each other and the table and the ceiling.  Then my youngest, practically whispers, ""please, mom, no"".  I then say, ""Well, since you all find it so hilarious, it's probably time you understand about females"" and I proceed to verbally eviscerate them with knowledge they never wanted to have.

That was an awesome game.  Good times."
"""And not locking the door"""
Didn't everyone have a vacant mansion for sex with hot college girls when they were 18?  
Sounds like he just did. Maybe he's from the future and in another universe he didn't bark at you to lock the door and you got killed by an axe murderer because of it.
Suuuuure. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Why did you think she would like this. Even if she farted, that does not mean she did it intentionally or she likes to be FARTED IN THE FACE."

"Feels good, according to my gf. We don't do it often, for risk of infection, but... sometimes...  

**Edit:** For those asking about infection in relation to urine being sterile: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/turns-out-urine-isnt-actually-sterile-180954809/

Even with it not being sterile, the bigger problem is that in more sensitive areas of the body, like the vagina or up da butt, there is a delicate balance of good bacteria and other things that helps keep things clean and operating properly. Disrupting this balance can lead to infections and other problems, which is why women shouldn't douche much, or at all unless necessary, or use too much soap or other hygiene products down there (even if they claim to be good for the area). Same with the butt with whatever gender, but less people shoot soap and other disrupting things up there.

"Translation for the out-of-tune: ""Why the fucking hell would you let the donkey put his two foot long penis inside your asshole?!?!""

You're welcome. "
No that would have been an abortion. 
Could have just spit on the food like a normal asshole. Instead you had to be a dumb asshole. Honestly though you majorly fucked up
Fairly sure waterboarding was invented before 1997
Whoa wtf bro I think I have prostate issues then... like I've avoided reading about this on purpose but that literally sounds exactly like what mine feels like (my urethra I mean). Sometimes I know I got more piss in there but it's just like it get closed off or something.
Checking out checks out.
I died more of the thought that 1998 was 18 years ago... 
"Lmao, you even warmed it up in the microwave"

"Broken tails are generally treated by letting the cat rest and pain meds, but if the nerve is damaged causing lack of sensation and the tail drags on the ground, amputation is often necessary. Early treatment can prevent that, sometimes"
"To be fair, if a problem can't be solved by talking and then leads to a break up it kind of became the solution.
Not a happy ending straight away but may enable those parties to find a truer happiness down the line.

Your sentiment is correct - but if two people are that disconnected then it's probably not a healthy relationship"
"I have to say, life is somewhat easier since I got comfortable with silence."
That's not fair at all. You should go talk to someone about being able to take the exam again. 
"Sore neck, and feelings now, neat."
That is a 6 page report and a bitching at about liability. Ain't nobody got time for that. My gym teacher used to tell us that if we were going to get injured do him the courtesy of dying because it is less paper work.

Negative of wan?
Wan not?"
He can deffinetly be a dick head. But just glad I didn't fight with my partner to stay in bed could have gotten a lot more than my empty wallet hahaha 
I mean it's a type of masturbation... just not the everyday kind.
Hope you gave that mother fucking homie a treat!
The first of many shared vomits to come awww  congrats!

I hope he flossed
Lmao what a turn of events...
Hope you find your couch.
*sigh zip*
I think he gets that now
The girl who wrote that out was a bitch for that move. 
"When I went to do the paperwork to sell my house one of the office women commented to my realtor ""I didn't know 16 year olds were buying and selling homes"" after seeing me. Bitch, I was 29. I wish she had said it to my face so I could shame her in front of her coworkers."
Because you couldn't reach his face?
JRHNBR? 
"You, sir, deserve way more points for that comment."
"I mean, it IS Japanese..."
Dry. I like it.
That's true. I felt a little bad and laughed a little is all
OP was an idiot. Posting in TIFU is exactly for admitting idiocy. He's a college intern and learned a valuable lesson. Cheers on OP for recognizing the fault and learning from it.

"Yeah, just local police and PTA members weren't allowed to do it back then."
"I knew it.

One day, maybe a decade from now.  You will be happy and content.  You will have a spouse, you might have kids.  A dog, I see a dog, definitely a dog.

And the house, you are a homeowner.  You got shit that needs fixed.  You have no clue what you are doing but you fake it and hope for the best.

You will look back at this and when you do you will see something with absolute clarity.

God himself traded that $100 bill for that picture.  It was the best $100 you will spend in your entire life.  

A bullet was dodged.  No woman that gets pregnant with another mans baby then gets a secret abortion is worth keeping.

My friend, to say leaving was the correct decision is an incredible understatement.

There will come a point where she says she just wants to stay friends for emotional support.  (I know these people like the back of my hands)

Understand something.  She has plenty of people for that already.  Family.  Friends.  Those people that she confided in that kept this secret from you - she can get emotional support from those people.  She has no need from you.

Leave.  Block her phone number on your phone.  Tell Gmail to send her address to the trash when it gets incoming mail.  Be done.

You will do better.

Henry got mad that I didn't let him Into the chicken pen and when I came out he kicked me. Left a welt of his hoof print for a few days. Everyone has there days so I'm not mad at him 
Call the police non emergency number for the precinct of the air b&amp;b and explain the situation and your concerns. I suggest non emergency since this call may take a while to explain.

"If anyone is interested in reading into this and running in general, I highly suggest the book Born To Run. It's interesting and funny and discusses why people who run heel -&gt; toe suffer more injuries than any other athletes (at the time that it was published)."
I really hope you got them evicted because these people deserve to see their faults. I hope you meet better people soon!

"This is why I despair at American issues.

Instead of a doctor giving you a $100 arse fingering, you'll end up costing the country thousands of dollars in Medicare cover from your prostate cancer.

This, ladies and gentlemen is why it's actually cheaper to offer free, universal cover."
