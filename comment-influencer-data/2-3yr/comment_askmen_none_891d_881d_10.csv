Has to be the display of moderately expensive bottles of liquor they've drank and decorated with.
No clean up and shows some sense of either devotion or just freakiness. Plus it feels good when she just keeps sucking. 
"It's a feeling of being enjoyed rather than obligated.  When a girl spits it can have an ""I'll do this but I don't like it very much"" vibe about it.  When a girl swallows, it makes it seem like she actually enjoys getting you off.  That's sexy.

Imagine if a guy got you off orally and IMMEDIATELY ran to the bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth.  As opposed to the guy who stayed there and enjoyed every last drop of you while you came down from your orgasm. "
"My senior year of high school I asked out this girl that seemed to genuinely be interested in me and she told me to meet her by my car after school to talk about it. She didn't notice me walking up behind her when I hear her tell her friends standing next to her that ""he's way too ugly to get with someone like me."" 

I know that other people have heard way worse and it doesn't bother me much now but at the time I was completely crushed. Pretty much destroyed what little self esteem I had. "
"""Man cave"" sign"
"""You're *really* awesome Pollo, way better than most guys I know. I would totally sleep with you if you lost some weight.""

I understand where she was coming from, I do. But fuck man, that's not something you say.

Anyway I dropped 60lbs and fucked her best friend."
"Romantic.

"""You're basically nothing more than a human dildo."""
Good cover. 'Gee baby I just don't know where on earth we'd ever fin- why would you lookie there?  The links are even color coded purple for passion!' 
"Oh boy...I was talking to this one girl and she asked me where my family was from so I tell her I'm from Ethiopia and she hits me with ""Oh, so you're not *Black* black"". Against my better judgment I ask her what that means and she goes on about how ""you people actually have values"" (as opposed to Black Americans I guess??).


Anyways, that was the last time that I talked to her."
"This is the best answer, and I did what you described to a girl I dated in my youth.  I love giving oral, but she did it as a duty, bored and ran to the bathroom to spit and brush her teeth.  So one night, I was going down on her, she came, and I ran to the bathroom to brush my teeth.  She followed me, yelling at how offensive that was.

This was the day I learned that women aren't rational and are incapable of seeing their own hypocrisy :P"
"I went on a date with a woman a couple of months back and during the process of getting to know each other, I told her that I take care of my disabled older brother.  He has major depression issues and is unable to use his dominant hand due to a bad injury he sustained a decade ago.  He has been on SSD for awhile now.  All she did was criticize me for taking him in.  ""He's a big boy, he can take care of himself.""  ""I don't get why you're taking care of your brother, that's his own responsibility.""  I will never ever kick a family member when they're down.  The last thing he needs is to be put out on the street with the possibility he may take his own life.  Fuck you bitch, and the horse you rode in on."
"She was paying 40k to major in religion, math is obviously not her forte."
"""Ill fuck anyone, i have no standards at all""

Then followed by my friend suggesting me she then said:

""Well i have some standards of course"""
"&gt;  someone like me

lmao who even talks like that"
Fuck. Thats me.
"""Got any kinks I should know about?""

""I'm an ass man"""

"Say ""Don't worry, I've got this"" give a wink and do the finger guns"
"My money is ""our money"", her money is ""her money"".

Because, she's self described feminist with ""traditional relationship beliefs"".

So in other words, she's a modern woman who know's what she wants and can have what she wants but also cherry picks ""traditional"" values that basically mean I provide everything she wants but anything she has, she keeps for herself.

**Edit:**  *Just want to preface, I'm rarely someone who fishes for internet points but I have to thank those of you who've made this one of my most upvoted comments. Although there is a much longer story to the above, it was a difficult breakup recently. I and anyone else who'd listen was told what an awful person I was for having concerns about how things were going to the point I was doubting myself after being told I was crazy. As nuts as it sounds, the fact at least a few people here agreed makes me feel a little less crazy right now, so thank you.*"

"My comment is for relationships that are ending: *Just because the relationship ended doesn't mean it was a failure.* Maybe you two just grew incompatible. Maybe one of you moved away and one or neither wanted a long distance relationship. Whatever the case may be, I feel like whenever a couple breaks up, people assume that something is wrong with one of the people in the relationship, or that the relationship was bad. These things *do* happen, but I don't like to think that this applies to *all* ended relationships.

IMO, as long as both people were able to grow and are better people for having dated each other, it's hardly a failure."
"100% agreement and compatibility, all the time, no exceptions.

People are not like this. Relationships take work and compromise, and if something is broken you should try to fix it instead of leaving."
Just because technology allows us to be in contact 24/7 doesn't mean we have to text all day every day. I had an ex who got upset when I told her I couldn't text back and forth all day when I was at work.

He lost weight and got sex. Seems like she helped him out in the long run.
"She has certain traits that i place a lot of value into; so to me she's superior.

But that doesn't mean everyone places the same value on the same traits.

So I guess from my perspective it's both, but to everyone else it's a matter of preference"

"
Both those girls are super naive. That's beyond normal for guys to do. 
"To be honest if a woman doesn't like to swallow it puts a big ""I don't enjoy this that much"" stamp on her giving me oral, as such I simply cannot enjoy it that much if I feel she is not enjoying it.

Like, you can't just lie back and relax because you are painfully aware that the end result is unpleasant for her. It sounds like a small aspect of sex...but after 35 years of living and 8 and a half years of what I am happy to call a perfect relationship I put great stock in sexual chemistry and comfort for both people. 

Edit : Getting a few weirdly aggressive DMs from people who seem to love pole but not swallowing. That's awesome, enjoy it but I answered the question from my perspective is all. I ain't asking you to suck my dick so you shouldn't worry about how I feel about dick sucking. lol "
"Not directly to me but still... I was dating a girl and after a few weeks we decided to tell everyone. Some of her friends laughed at her: 'omg are you really going out with THAT guy hahahaha'.

"I was a Sophomore in College and at one of my teammates' house party and a buddy and I asked these two Junior sorority girls if they wanted to play beer pong, one guy, one girl to a team. So we're playing and starting to chat, typical college small talk, which dorm, where are you from, etc. She is friendly and cute so all seems to be going well. So like 2 minutes in, I ask what her Major is, she says ""Religion, what's yours?"" I go ""Well I have been in Poli-Sci, but I'm thinking about switching to Math."" She goes ""Ew, Math? Well then *we* have nothing to talk about."" Straight up stopped acknowledging me after that. "
"That's the one, right there.

"Yup this was me up until last month. I posted on Askmen asking for advice on what to get for my new apartment now that I am recently single for the first time and living solo. This came up of what not to do. I realized that I kept all of my empty bottles of wineâ€”not intentionally to be a douche and gloat, but just because I just never threw them away. I realized how douchy and tacky it looked and I quickly threw them all away.

This is why I love Reddit. "

"Just got shot with this today:

""What do you think of me?""

"Oh boy! I feel like I was born to answer this question. I'm in a 10-year-old relationship with a very active women where I am very calm guy that is very introverted and needs a lot of time alone. I will try to write you a quick ""manual"", just give me 20 min or so. Also feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions. BRB with extended version.

EDIT:

First of all, and this is crucial, establish with your SO that this is this kind of relationship, and that you both have your needs. Try to both express to eatchother your needs, what you want to do for fun, what you want to do to chill together, what you want to do when you want to be alone.

In that conversation you both have to accept your differences and feel comfortable with the needs of the other party. He probably needs some time alone to ""recharge"" his batteries. If you live together, in time, he will become comfortable with regenerating with you around. If you're living apart you have to give him space where he's not answering phone, not responding to texts and where you not pressure him with those. On the other side he has to acknowledge your needs to keep active, to stay in touch and keep conversation going.

It's a delicate balance, that will probably be more daunting on you. He's used to people bothering him and breaching his ""personal bubble"" and the default response is to cut them off. Your both job is to make you welcome in that bubble in a way where he's comfortable with you and you feeling comfortable within it.

There's a lot of reaching out on both parts if it's to work in a long run. However hard it is for him, he has to gather the energy to go out, meet new people, engage in your endeavours. On the other hand you have to be able to smoothly integrate into his world, when he's ""alone"". In our case we played video games together, because I love games. I read to her my childhood books when she was falling asleep, because I love reading. We cook together because we both love delicious, foreign food. Create your own little adventures, where you are the only two heroes.

When you plan your time together, remember that anyone but you may be a strain for him. Friends are ok, but hanging out around them is tiring and requires some silence afterward. From him; and that may be a VERY hard lesson; he needs to learn to let you go, experience world on your own. But remember, trust is the key, once you loose it, it's near impossible to recover. But if your intentions are pure, in time, he will begin to feel comfortable with you exploring world and bringing results into his bubble.

Speaking of silence. Learn the beauty of it. We, introverts, love being quiet. Try sitting on a bench, just enjoying the air, wind, smells... no words necessary. Or eat a meal at a food court without a word. It's not awkward, if you try it it's really not. You can experience the sound of surroundings, communicate just by smiles and eye expressions. It really builds a connection when you don't have to verbally comment on everything.

It's a difficult road but very fulfilling if you're able to find that equilibrium. You both will grow and experience new stuff, and belive me... love blossoms at the edge of silence and shouts.

EDIT: My first gold. Thank you."
"I asked her out and she told me she wasn't interested in me that way. We're still friends, but no where near as close as we used to be. Which sounds crappy, but it's actually good for me. I'm not breaking my back trying to please her anymore and I don't have to pine after her anymore."
"Relationships with constant drama/arguments/bickering. The thought of it just makes me tired. I've already got enough to worry about, and don't need that kind of stress in my life. "
"Yeah, its like a cycle that repeats itself. 

1. Start feeling really lonely and horny
1. Chat up lots of girls on tinder/okcupid
1. Go to dates until theres some mutual interest with someone
1. Go to a few more dates with same person, maybe have sex, probably not
1. It blows up or fades out
1. Get really sad and delete tinder/okcupid accounts and swear off internet dating for good
1. Start feeling really lonely and horny"

"Dating this girl for a few months. To give some background, first girl I really liked and went the full ""nice guy"" route. I'd cave in to her demands, let her push me around, make fun of me in public, etc. Obviously that won't work in any relationship so when she dumped me she said I was a bitch and Im the type of guy she would settle for in a few years. She then asked me to stay in touch so she can see how I am doing in a few years. That very night I found out she fucked one of my player friends within minutes of dumping me. Felt pretty bad but I took it as motivation to be better and now things are pretty great.

"Oh man. I used to be in the gym about 14-15 times a week between weights/condition and assorted martial arts stuff (BJJ, MMA). Was a huge guy, fast as hell, could do endurance running or cycling events. Absolutely lived the gym life. 

Then I had an accident resulting in a broken neck and some messed up intestines. Depression and anxiety followed, agoraphobia, suicidal thoughts and efforts. Thankfully with the help of loved ones I was able to overcome it all.

The intestines were the worst, those issues lingered for YEARS until we solved them but I ended up losing over 100 pounts and become incredibly weak as well. Been working very hard now to get myself back to even average health and build a base for a healthy active future. I guess the good thing is that my doctors have said repeatedly if I wasn't in the shape I was in when I first got hurt I would most likely be dead by now.

In my case I had to become obsessed. Every meal, every sleep, every physical effort is all towards a future than I want to be better than my past. It was really the only way I could stop the depression and anxiety from controlling me. I had to make it my enemy and effectively get into my old mindset, that I was training each and every day to become more than I was before.  "

I am happy for her finding a relationship, but I lost respect because she said it to gloat and to be rude as that was OPs question.

"A friend of mine was dumped by a girl after they'd been together for EIGHT YEARS.

"Don't in the same breath tell someone that they're awesome *and* too fat to fuck.

"I told her how I felt, she said she ""didn't feel that way"". I had a hard time dealing with seeing her dating someone else and we kinda lost touch. Then a couple years later she had broken up with her bf, we met, reconnected, started dating, and now we're married."
"I don't like getting oral (better to give than to receive in my opinion! :) ) but I've had girls swallow and I've had girls spit. Activities being interrupted for her to walk into the bathroom semi-gagging and rinsing her mouth is pretty unsexy.

However you can spit in a sexy way, pushing it out of your mouth and letting it dribble all down your face. Add in a ""I'm your dirty little whore, Daddy."" and that'd probably get most guys' motor going."

"This wasn't said to me, but to a friend of mine:  I was pursuing a girl (friend of a lady friend) and we all went out one night with a guy friend of mine who is younger (early 20s) than us (mid 20s/early 30s) and still has a baby face. She kept telling my friend he was like a little puppy, at one point she said to him at a bar ""go bring me a chair, puppy"". I had enough at that point and told her to knock it off. She got all pissy, but apologized later on in the night. I stopped pursuing her and didn't follow up when she would try to set up future dates. "

She puts up with my shit. And throws my smart ass-ery right back at me and its fun. Other SOs in the past have not done that. 

But no I don't think she is superior to other people on basic human level. She is kind, and pretty, and we get along great. She is a superior match for me personally but on an objective level I don't think she is superior. My friends probably wouldn't be interested in dating her. She isn't saving the world or anything. Shes just a person like the rest of us. And that's okay."
"Currently about a year and a half. I simply haven't met a woman that I find really attractive and compatible since my last breakup.

I don't need rebounds and similar shit. If I find a woman that seems right for me I go all in, otherwise I don't even try. Why would I waste mine and hers time and energy?"
"I wear glasses. I don't know if it was like this for everyone, but behold I had them, I just sorta unconsciously stopped paying attention to shit beyond my range unless I had a reason to. One day in math class I'm a little tired and zoned out. Class hadn't started and we'd all taken our seats or were chatting.

While I'm zoned out, I guess I picked the wrong direction to space, because I realize that this girl is yelling at me beyond my visible range. I don't know what all she said,  it what I heard towards the end of it was, ""You're too *ugly* to stare at me.""

I felt bad for the microsecond before I heard her words. Then I just shrugged, said, "" I spaced"" and did whatever else I did to pass the time in middle school."
"I don't pay you enough to complain. In fact, I don't pay you at all. "
"Couldn't have coffee in our break room. It was the most perplexing thing when I showed up as not providing free coffee to employees seemed like bizzaro world. It was also a place where it was all academics.

Turned out that the woman who managed the break room was also the president of the institution's sister.  Ok, so I ask someone, ""Is it like a Mormon thing? Are they against coffee cause religion?"" That was responded to with a really hasty ""no,"" which was weirdly defensive since it's not like a bad thing to be Mormon, but apparently the leader I asked thought that would be awful to be accused of.

The answer given is that she says coffee was too messy and they made a rule against it. Then find out she also runs the cafe in the building that's the only source of coffee. Got it. So it's a racket to make employees buy coffee instead. Am told that's not it either and that it's really the mess thing and to really just drop it.

So, I decided to save money on coffee downstairs and just bring in a French Press to make my own. This works for about a week where I leave it in the break room to share with people and promptly clean it up to avoid that thing about coffee being messy. Then, one day, the woman managing the break room sees it and it's like red alert. She's pissed. Someone yells across the office space asking whose it is and I decide to duck out for a bathroom break through a side door. She was like an Amazon and kinda scary. It was also my first grown up job and I wasn't going to rock the boat with leadership by a squabble with his sister over coffee.

In the end, I just boycotted the cafe and walked to the gas station down the road for coffee breaks instead."

Maybe I have some expectations for my wedding and some things I want for me and my tastes, or to be catered to on valentine's day rather than just catering to her all day for a blow job or some sex at the end of the night.

"Reminds me of a poem by Jack Gilbert:

Failing and Flying

ByÂ Jack Gilbert

Everyone forgets that Icarus also flew.Â 

It's the same when love comes to an end,Â 

or the marriage fails and people sayÂ 

they knew it was a mistake, that everybodyÂ 

said it would never work. That she wasÂ 

old enough to know better. But anythingÂ 

worth doing is worth doing badly.Â 

Like being there by that summer oceanÂ 

on the other side of the island whileÂ 

love was fading out of her, the starsÂ 

burning so extravagantly those nights thatÂ 

anyone could tell you they would never last.Â 

Every morning she was asleep in my bedÂ 

like a visitation, the gentleness in herÂ 

like antelope standing in the dawn mist.Â 

Each afternoon I watched her coming backÂ 

through the hot stony field after swimming,Â 

the sea light behind her and the huge skyÂ 

on the other side of that. Listened to herÂ 

while we ate lunch. How can they sayÂ 

the marriage failed? Like the people whoÂ 

came back from Provence (when it was Provence)Â 

and said it was pretty but the food was greasy.Â 

I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell,Â 

but just coming to the end of his triumph

"

""Hey self, I should fuck this hot chick!""  ""Fuck off self, I've got an awesome girlfriend who would be devastated if I cheated on her.  Also she might castrate or kill me, an that would ruin my life."""

"I just want to be 'fair' and not make them feel like they have to pay for me just because they're men. I mean, if I went out with my girlfriends, we would all pay for ourselves. But every time I tell them the reasoning above, they insist that they're doing it because they want to pay, etc etc."
"Story time! A few years ago I was dating this seemingly very shy girl who was also liked video games. It was our second date, and we had decided to go into the city to just explore and see what we could find. We had a destination in mind at first, but on our way there, we see a big neon sign that says ""ADULT ARCADE"". We talked and figured it'd be pretty funny to see what exactly that meant, so we went inside. It was a pretty seedy porn shop, and the ""arcade"" was in the back behind a curtain. We asked about it, and the guy looked us up and down, then told us it was 10 bucks for 10 minutes, with a 20 minute minimum. Deciding 20 bucks was worth our curiosity, so we bought the passes. We go in the back and it's this very small and narrow hallway with rows of small doors on either side. We hear some faint sounds, and the doors that are open reveal small closet-like areas with closed circuit TVs in the wall, and a single chair. We go into one of the closets and just sort of awkwardly laugh at the situation. It was pretty weird, and the girl just laughed and said ""well we have at least ten minutes"" and she put in one of the passes into the slot below the TV. Porn comes up, and we find that we're able to change the channel to different porn movies, and different types of porn - gay, threesome, shemale, all sorts of stuff. There didn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to what the next thing would be, so at first we just watched trying to figure out a pattern. After a bit, we came up with a game. One of us would sit in the chair facing away from the TV and the other would change the channel. The one in the chair would have to guess what kind of porn it was based off the sounds. We did this for the ten minute pass (we didn't keep going for the next ten). 

It was this weird, uniquely unexpected fun experience with someone who seemed kind of closed off. After that we were totally comfortable and she really opened up. We only dated for a couple months, but we would just go on long drives or hikes, just go around the city, or walk through small towns. We never let it get very serious as she went to school in an entirely different state and neither of us were up for that. I'm getting off topic, but yeah, that's my porn experience with an SO lol"

"This. 

My wife of 16 years left me because, and I quote, ""I'm feeling old, fat and ugly. I need to go find myself. All I know is that I won't to be married to you anymore.""

She had changed into a 37 year old party girl, regularly coming home at 4:00 AM. As it turned out she had a boyfriend."
"""I don't date asian guys"" - an asian girl.

"Part of this is because a lot of us guys are brought up this way. We're taught that the man is the one to pay. I have some friends that I hang out with regularly. We take turns paying for drinks and dinner. It took some getting used to at first though. 

Just tell them this time dinner or drinks are on you. Tell them they can pay the next time.  "
"When I was in high school, I took this girl I had been dating who I really really liked to prom. My parents decided to be cool and got us a limo and reservations to a 5 star restaurant.  The girl's best friend was dating my friend at the time so they were going with us and 2 other couples I knew also went with us. We did all the pre-prom bullshit at my house and one of the moms just wouldnt stop taking pictures so my parents had to keep reminding them ""hey they better get going, they have reservations at 7:30"". So we're on our way to the place and it's like 7:10 but we're most of the way there. Suddenly my mom calls me and is like ""hey I'm really sorry but I just realized the reservation are at 7:00. Your dad called the restaurant and they said it was no problem, but I wanted to let you know so you guys wouldn't waste too much time when you got there."" So I let everyone know and say that my parents just got the time mixed up, it was totally cool, we just had to kind of hurry up when we got there. Everyone seemed fine and then my girlfriend says in the most sarcastic, bitchy tone, at conversation volume, ""I'm just sooo glad that my boyfriend isn't a total fuck up"".   I don't even remember saying anything, I was just so hurt that I could try so hard to do everything right and plan all this stuff to go to an event that I thought I wouldn't have fun at (I fucking hate dancing), but I was optimistic and down to dance. I did all this planning to make this girl happy and she just shit on me. 

Someone also told me that she was going around telling people that she had a shit time at prom a couple weeks after she broke up with me. I don't think I'll ever forget that though."

"What I miss about a relationship is that comfort of days gone by. Waking up with someone, being able to vent, that awesome sex that only comes from being with someone you are really comfortable with.

Having said that, if it's not the right person, it comes with all sorts of problems that just make life worse in the long run. In that case, it's better to be single"
"What you said was still rude tbh, especially if the guy was genuine. "
"One thing I refuse to tell girlfriends (and this may change if I was going to marry one) is my number of sexual partners.  There is no reason they need to know that.  The thing is, everyone has an expected number in their mind based on age, attractiveness, etc.  IF you are too far either way, then they start questioning things.  Very little good comes from this"
"At a party in high school a girl got dared to hug me in front of everyone, (because that was my role in HS, be that fucking joke) and after she did she told me in front of everyone that was the most physical contact with a woman I'd ever have.

"About 10 years ago I was a waiter at a restaurant and it was a slow weeknight. I was shooting the shit with the hostess, and casually mentioned how empty my section was. She replied, ""I guess people don't want a waiter with jacked up teeth."" Fuck. Ouch. 

For context, my teeth weren't that bad - they were crooked and were a natural color, as opposed to being the unnatural white you see in toothpaste commercials. Eventually, I got braces and now my smile is ballin'. "

"I work in labour and employment law. A lot of my cases are about a new manager coming in and deciding he/she wants to bring in their own team, which means forcing members of the old team out and looking for any reason to discipline and fire the old employees. I've seen it so often that it's easy to spot when the disciplines and terminations are not legitimate. The managers think they're being slick and covering their trails and think they can talk their way out of it, but it all follows the same narrative. It's one of those things that you don't realize is so common until you deal with it day-to-day. I get that it can be hard being a new manager and getting everybody to buy in from the get-go, but you can't just fire everybody when they've been in their position for years."

I've tried meetup, I've tried volunteering, I've really done my best and I just can't find people to spend any meaningful time with regularly and it's not enough for me. They're just not interested in putting in the work to grow friendships, and I'm far from an awkward unlikeable neckbeard stereotype.

Having kids is my last hope. Maybe I'll make friends among the parents of other smelly, screaming hellgoblins. But until then, reddit is my methadone. 

Hold on to your friends for sure, and by that I mean really hold on to them. Go where they go."

Women tend to decorate the house. Society in the U.S. has it so women make the house decisions and the whole ""happy wife happy life"" syndrome.

Her way, and this seems to be the norm, is ""my place is mine, yours is ours, and ours is mine""."

But I'm not wild about me.  I can only remember the failure, can only see things not coming out the way I have them in my head.  I'm embarrassed about my sexuality, deep down.  I feel guilty for wanting sex, guilty for liking certain acts, guilty for lots of stuff.  Irrational stuff.  Knowing is different from feeling, I can know my concerns are bullshit but still feel the weight of them.  

When she swallows me, that feeling goes away.  That someone would accept me, even that part of me, is amazing.  "

"Indeed.    

Women say some pretty dirty shit when a hot guy walks in (depending on the group dynamic). Then act all hypocritical when a man does the same stuff. If men shouldn't objectify women then women need to stop objectifying men.   

Realistically neither men or women are going to change; so people should stop being all critical of others for completely normal behaviour. Where it crosses the line is when these ""bro"" cultures mix with jobs/professionalism and women or men are left out in the cold as a result. This is personal life stuff with your friends, not job/work stuff. Also catcalling is always a dick move, regardless of gender.    

To be honest in the OP's story it reads more like petty jealousy than anything; or as others have said they have a stick up their butts.

"I think this is why very romantic people actually end up the least happy or end up alone, because they have this idea that relationships are always supposed to be heart racing, butterflies, and no problems.

"So, I used to play football in school and was in amazing shape. When I quit playing I ballooned out to around 280 lbs, but had deluded myself into thinking I was still moderately healthy. I stayed that way all through highschool. Fortunately once I went to college I lost a little weight due to improved habits and generally being too poor to avoid food. After a couple years I got pissed at the whole institution of higher education, dropped out of college, and went to play semipro football. Got into amazing shape again. Then, once again, quit playing and became a disgusting fat sack of ass. This time my knees started hurting, I wasn't sleeping well, dropped into crippling depression, got winded going up the stairs...

One day I stood on a scale and it read back 315. That was all it took. I went and bought my own scale and lived off a 1200 calorie diet. Dropped 50 lbs in a few months, started going to the gym and converting fat back to muscle, and was once again able to wear ~~people clothes~~ pants from a department store instead of a specialty fatass store.

A man and his wife had plans to go to a Halloween party. The night of, the wife suddenly came down with a headache. ""Go ahead and have fun without me,"" she said, so her husband put on his costume and went to the party.

An hour later, the wife felt better and thought it would be funny to surprise her husband by showing up at the party incognito. She quickly bought a different costume than what she had planned to wear and went to the party. 

To her surprise, her husband was at the party drinking away and wildly flirting with every woman he saw. So she decided she would mess with him a little bit. She danced up to him and really started grinding on him. After a few minutes she whispered a suggestion that they go upstairs. ""Let's keep our masks on,"" she said. Then she proceeded to do all sorts of nasty things in the bedroom upstairs. She rode him, bent over for him, even let him go up her ass.

Afterwards she hurried home and got into bed. A little while later her husband came in. 

""So how was the party?"" she asked. 

""Eh it was ok, but I left pretty early because some of the guys invited me to play cards. I lent my costume to Fred, though, and boy did he have a good time."""

"It really came down to she was just more sexually experienced than me. It was a little over a year ago and we had been hanging out about two months with her basically living at my apartment for the last two weeks. The last day we fucked in the shower, then as we were getting dressed my upstairs neighbors started getting pretty loud with their morning session. I kind of jokingly asked her ""what the hell could he be doing to get that kind of reaction?"" And she replied with with that... 

So I know I kind of asked for it. But to add insult to injury she left probably 10 minutes later, and thats the last I've heard from her. I guess the reason it's such a shitty memory in my head is that she never once during sex said she wasn't enjoying it, or ""hey try this"". There just isn't really a better way to kill a man's self esteem than to equate his existence to a piece of plastic."

"The first time my gf (who i've previously only had very vanilla sex with) and I watched porn we were casually browsing through pornhub and what it had to offer.

Well it turned out that this girl had daddy issues and couldn't stop dirty talking about how much she wanted her dad to fuck her, and calling him 'daddy' the whole way through.

I'm feeling awkward as fuck thinking 'jesus she's going to think i'm into some weird ass incest shit' when she turns over to me and goes 'daddy will you fuck me now?'

It's now a thing that drives her wild and we use it in the bedroom all the time! Ty pornhub!"

"I won't lie, I was pretty heartbroken, but after some time apart, I was able to get a better perspective on things. I found that our friendship wasn't really fair to either of us; I treated her far better than I would someone I wasn't romantically interested in, which meant she probably valued me as a friend more than she should have. Without the romantic tension, I can treat her as just a friend."
"Pretty much any complaint about how women only go for a certain type of guy.  Whether the complaint is that they only go for rich handsome guys or for broke douche bags who treat them like shit, either way it's clearly false.

"So, you're not fundamentally wrong, but there's so much more to it than ""just a bit of cramping,"" and I feel like you should know that. I had an abortion with the pill method a few years ago. I was eight weeks pregnant and absolutely certain that it was what I wanted-- it still *is* what I wanted, and I've never regretted it. The first pill is pretty big and hard to swallow. The second thing, 24 hours later, is four (bitter, pill-flavored) pills that you have to hold in your mouth, between your teeth and cheeks, for at least half an hour while they dissolve (and then swallow what's left). I went through labor pains for eight or nine hours and blacked out twice. I vomited everything in my stomach, repeatedly, even the tiny sips of water I took to wash my mouth out. After that was dry heaving when I wasn't blacked out. And huge blood clots. I bled through six towels and my sheets. It was disgusting and hellish. I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat, but it sure as fuck wasn't ""just a bit of cramping.""

It's my experience that people that think you need to be rude to help someone aren't particularly adept at zeroing in on other's communication styles.

I wasnt able to get a decent job (thanks 2008) but I had a plan to join her after a while.  A few months pass and she starts to lose touch. 

A few months after that she comes back into town for our best friend's wedding. I tell her I still love her and want to work this out, I have a plan etc.   She tells me that she doesn't see me in her life back home and ""... You are not going anywhere in life anyway..."" 

Well, guess what bitch, I was just headhunted by a very well respected company in my industry and making 6 figures.  Game...blouses"
"For me, my space/alone time didn't feel like it *counted* if my ex made me feel guilty about it afterwards. 

We talked about our respective needs a lot, and a lot of the relationship involved both of us making pretty good faith efforts to meet each other's needs. 

I asked her to give me no strings attached space and not to hold it against me. In return, she asked me to step up my efforts to make sure the time that we did spend together was quality time where we really focused on each other and didn't just exist in the same room at the same time while doing separate things or going on autopilot.

It was a reasonable compromise, and we made it work for a while with each of us being willing to sacrifice some of our wants for the sake of a good relationship.

After two years, we ultimately decided that our needs about space/attention and other important things were too different to be sustainable forever and we split amicably.

Sometimes a good relationship has a fatal flaw."
"It felt so tender and mushy on the inside and it is an amazing feeling on the fingers and even more so on the penis. Most of all, the sense that the woman is letting you access to the most intimate part of her body."
"Is this even a question? Legs and skin showing. 

"
Are you Asian by any chance?
"Driving for the first time by myself, such a great feeling"
"I think we can all agree you only have two options:
 
1. Kill yourself.
 
2. Clean it up."
"Move to Australia, if that was said here she is now your best friend."
"Dude it's not a fucking rejection, it's a polite way to spare you a rejection.  Also, people in very attached relationships often talk that way, regardless of who they're talking to, because that's how they see themselves.  To do otherwise would be like a football player talking about the time he won the super bowl.  When you're part of a team, you speak in terms of the team when you're talking about team activities."
"That's kinda what guys want, keep sucking until he tells you to stop. 

At least that's the logic I take when I go down on women. I never assume theyre done their orgasm until I get that tap on the forehead telling me to stop. Unfortunately in the past I ruined a few orgasms by stopping before the girl actually got over the line, thinking they had already started cumming. 

Plus if you keep going down on a woman during her orgasm, you must just parlay it into multiple orgasms. 
"
Some guys cum can taste like a mouthful of battery acid. Not swallowing has nothing to do with enjoying giving head.
"Oh shit man that stings. The worst I got was ""Just be happy"". I hope you're doing okay."
"I don't understand how someone could let household repairs go undone.

My ex-wife got the McMansion in the divorce.  I've been divorced going on 7 years now and my former home is falling apart.  The exterior paint is peeling, the internal paint in the bathrooms are peeling.  Toilet seats are broken.  There is black mold around the seams in one of the tubs.  The sidewalk and driveway concrete are crumbling.  The garage automatic door doesn't work any more, and there is a vice grip on one of the burner knobs on the stove.  

Meanwhile, I hear a squeaky cabinet door and I am out with the WD-40 like a gunslinger.  

This must be a trend in women I marry because my second wife has her own home since she works in a different state.  There is a ceiling tile missing in the kitchen, one of the kitchen cabinet doors has fallen off, and half of the rooms upstairs don't have electricity.  

If I was ever captured by ISIS, they wouldn't have to set me on fire, they would just have to put me in a house with broken shit and not let me fix anything.

Edit: Spelling"
"A few years ago, one of the managers in the office had a vacancy that would have been a promotion for me.  I worked closely with this manager before and he always acknowledged that I did good work.  At the beginning of the year, he told me he wanted me for the spot and I would just have to wait until HR approved and advertised the position before anything could happen...but HR can take forever.  So in the months following, I did even more and more work for the guy just to show I can work for him.  I continued to do good work for him and upper management even noticed. Then about 6-7 months later, HR advertised the position, and he asked me for my application/resume/references right after.  I had an interview and I thought it was promotion time.  A week after my interview, he asks me to help schedule interviews for the spot.  I thought, ""okay that's fine..probably just to show HR we went through the motions instead of just handing me the spot.""  I helped with the interviews and then nothing happened for 2 weeks.  

2 weeks later, I walk into work, fire up my email, and see an announcement email announcing that someone else, outside of our office had gotten the job.  Shortly after reading that email, he walks to my cube and says, ""you must be feeling destructive right now, so can you destruct these applications.  Thanks.""  Mine was in there.  

I later learned that the person he chose was a close friend and also a friend from the military, which lead to me to believe he only fed me lies to show our upper management, who was all about hiring within, that he was considering people within our office.  "
"Female here.

It's strange to me how public everyone is on social media about their relationships nowadays. 

""Sweet note? Flowers? Gift? Better take a pic and post it so everyone knows how in love we are. Oh, it's your birthday? I must post a status about how much I love you so everyone knows!!""

Keeping things between the two of you and cherishing your privacy is a very under valued gesture now. 

There's something about knowing it's ours. That it's almost like our little sweet secret. The tender moments. The romantic, serious conversations. The depth in how we feel about one another. Not everyone needs to know all that. Which, in my opinion, makes it all the more special. "
Stepping on my shoes really activates my almonds. Or not treating my property with care and respect in general.
To be fair the army was pretty douchey tho
What does musky smell like? Google says a deer anus lol
"I want the fucking mammoth. I want it all. I want its meat for dinners and warmth. I want its rib cage for shelter. I want its tusks for weapons and its fur for clothes.

I want it all to myself. I hunt alone. I don't need anybody by my side. I'll distract it and spear it in a one man show.

That mammoth is mine bitch. I can feel its flesh giving way to the sides of of my spear tip beneath my force. I can feel it shaking the ground as it topples, defeated. I can feel its last whimper as I end its suffering with a stone hammer to its skull."
"How people can honestly believe the world is flat

Why OPs mom keeps coming back for more"
"Other than how amazing it felt, I was surprised by how you can feel the vaginal muscles squeezing from all over. You can definitely feel that when a girl has been working her kegels. "
Because she judged him by his culture.
"
&gt;""What do you think of me?""

""I don't.""

Ive said this to really piss someone off before. It, uhh, worked.
