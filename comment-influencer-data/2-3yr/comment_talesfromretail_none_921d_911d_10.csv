"It... bruises paper? Paper, which is made of wafer thin bits of dead tree?"
And he had three small children with him? Oh my.....
"Yeah, that was the most unnerving part. I wanted to get his license plate but he drove away too quickly. It would've been a different story if he HAD a licence but just didn't have it with him, but he was very adamant that he did not drive or own a drivers license. 

Part of me feels like he is lying though, because in order to GET a credit card at our store, you need a license or a state ID."
I would love to be a fly on their wall after that phone call
Present me wants to find her ask her how it bruises paper. Past me was working really hard
"I used to get calls like this when I delivered pizzas. Usually I would be polite and explain myself, but every so often I would get a jilted lover who wouldn't accept it. 

Once one of them caught me in a foul mood and I snapped ""well maybe if you delivered what I can deliver then maybe he wouldn't call me!"""
I had one man who ordered a case of 10 tiles. He brought back 9 cases a few days later. Turned out they sent him 10 cases instead of 10 tiles but charged him for 10 tiles. He didn't want anything in return. Just was doing the right thing. 
"This reminds me of the time I visited Hoover Dam and there was a long line to go through the metal detectors to get in. You could either take an escalator or use the stairs to get down to the entrance but the line was long enough that it started going up the stairs a bit. Some people came down the escalator, looked back at the line and just started to shuffle forward and move over like they were part of the line. I called them out on it and the woman looked at me and said ""But the line's all the way back there."" I said too bad and they grumbled but made their way to the back. Maybe I was being a bit cranky but it pissed me off that they thought they shouldn't have to wait when everyone else was."

"&gt;Don't name drop if you can't handle the consequences!

That was always fun at the paint store, someone wants to charge to one of the larger accounts, ""Oh so and so said it was fine"" Well I gotta hear them say that, call them up, account owner will either say yes, no, or ask to speak to the person. Loved it when it was option 3 and the person hangs up and says they'll be paying cash. "
"*Y: JUST LET ME SHOW YOU MY CREDIT STATEMENT.*

No thanks. Let me show *you* our fine assortment of **HEARING AID BATTERIES.**"
The caller id had a mans name.  I feel bad for that guy
"Yeah, one common theme on this thread is customers that get irrationally angry when asked for an ID. That's probably all this was. I just don't get it. Keep your freaking ID with you at all times. Wallet. Purse. Pocket. Whatever. At the very least, keep it in the glove compartment. Oy."
How can you be that deluded that after 3 different people have explained why it can't be done that you still demand it be done the way you want?! 
"There'll be all those people who watched Bladerunner and CSI and the like where they zoom/enhance/rotate something and get crystal clear images, and think it's real"
"The customer felt foolish. There have been so many times where customers have threatened ""I know so and so"" or ""so and so said this"" so it's nice to see someone smile and say ""OK"" instead of just giving in to what the customer wants. They don't expect you to call, just to roll over and give them everything they want. 

The customer also has to deal with the fallout that his neighbor is now going to think he's a ridiculous cry baby."
What you don't understand is that the law doesn't apply to them because they *want* something. The consequences you incur by illegally fulfilling that want is your problem.
"I work at a place that only gives out military discounts to active military, not retired. I think that's kind of ridiculous, personally. I'm more than happy to give out discounts to anyone who is serving or has served our country.

With that being said, if company policy says I can't do something, then I can't do it. It doesn't matter how much you think you deserve it, or how much you yell and complain at me. Some people could get in trouble or even lose their job for not following the rules. And I'm sorry, but your service doesn't put food on my table."
"I don't get this woman. Does she think in your free time you're going in the back and making shuttlecocks (whatever a shuttlecock is)?

This sub really makes me happy about my switch from retail to healthcare."
"""Not at all. You have the option to wait or leave. I expect you'll make a decision between those choices."""
"I don't work retail, so I can get away with it, but I work with engineers...

When someone pulls that ""let me speak to your male co-worker"" I always smile veeeeery sweetly and say, ""Maybe you should send your wife over here to talk for you since you seem to be unable to communicate effectively with a woman.""   

"
"I'm surprised you didn't make an exception because after all, she's 52! WTF"
You accept State IDs.... so you don't discriminate based on whether the customer drives or not... No part of his argument is valid LOL.
"I have a valid explanation for what's wrong with that woman, but I don't want to waste my time arguing with her about it."
"This sounds like one of those things her parents might've said to stop her from throwing/dropping things.  ""You'll bruise and ruin it, like an apple."""
"""You're discriminating against people who don't drive!""

*drives away*

"Just so you know, if you are in the US, you are not legally required to give a customer your name, and businesses are usually not allowed to require that you release it either (eg. List it on a receipt)

I never give my full name to a customer looking to complain. My first name is enough to figure out who I am, and I don't want to be harassed on any form of social media, which can and does happen from time to time.  "
Don't fuck with the queue. 
"He just wants to be able to drive down to the grocery store in his BMW, dressed in clothes made in Malaysia, talking to his wife on a cell phone made in Korea, and buy some god damn tomatoes grown in the god damn USA!! "
He just wants to make salad great again. 
"Stars,  it feels like you work at the Big Box store I used to work at. 

Anyway,  I also used to work at a returns counter and people would try to elicit sympathy on their return was denied. "
"I mean, it just barely begins to make sense, from a physics standpoint. 

Paper towels are porous and absorbent. Crushing paper towels would render them less porous, therefore less absorbent. 

Fortunately, paper towels are elastic (at least in this circumstance) and will bounce back into shape. it *barely* makes sense. "
"Did she think you answered your personal phone with a greeting like that every time?  

""Thank you for calling X Store.""  
""Uh.. this is.. just reminding you that you have a Doctor appointment on Tuesday?"""
what if he likes pain? then i just ruined his orgasm
"""Sir, the only available thickening agent is your brain, would it be ok if we use this?""

""Okay. I want it extra thick."""
"I wonder if she wanted proof of the value so she could then sell it? If it was for 100, and she sold it to someone for 90,  that is a win-win for both parties. "
You have said what many of us could not. We salute you for your bravery and forthrightness! 
I don't understand - what were the consequences? The customer got what he wanted? I'm annoyed that the manager bent the rules 
"YES. I'm a receptionist and have to place large catering orders but certain departments have a limit for their orders. If they tell me what to get them and it goes over the limit they'll tell me ""so-and-so told me it's fine. Just order it.""

So I email so-and-so and the tell me no, this is the rule, this department has a $200 lunch budget. So I tell the original person we are sticking to the budget and then they awkwardly have to pick a cheaper restaurant or take things off their order, which I find hilarious."
"I used to work at one of those ""we sell brand names for cheap"" stores. I was working the fitting room when a thin frazzled woman and her friend came in to try clothes on. At first I internally groaned at the sight of how many items were in her cart to try on as the limit was 8 at the time and their carts were overflowing. Finally after 35-40 minutes of just the thin lady trying on all these clothes she finally decided to take maybe 2 or 3 items. Before she left she said to me ""thank you for being so patient. My husband just died this month and I haven't been able to eat. My clothes just don't fit anymore."" And I just about lost it. I hugged her and she left but I will never forget the sadness that she radiated. "
"*Customer: Really? Is there a manager here?*

Why? Do you think he has more onions on him??"
"I work at an authorized repair place and get a lot of that too. 

Tons of ""I looked it up, it's a known issue"" - no it's not, if it was I'd have an article about it. 

""I'm here for my replacement phone"" - no, I'll be the one to determine if you get a new phone, repaired phone, or even if your phone has any problem at all. 

""You should have known I would need X part before I got here"" - no your appointment info only had your name, email, and that your phone was crashing. 

""I have insurance!"" - Not through X company you don't. 

""I have Y insurance!"" - Why did you come to X company??

""But I can get this fixed for half as much at the kiosk in the mall"" - Ok so why did you come here? Our prices aren't secret. Also their screens will stop working in 60 days and they are 80% likely to muck up your phone during repair. 

""I don't want to pay for a replacement phone. Why can't I just get a screen repaired?"" - well your phone is bent. Can't put a flat screen onto a bent phone. "
Velkum to the hooodrawlik press channelll and toodey ve hav deez PAPer towelsz
"&gt;Customer: WHY IS MY TOTAL THAT EXPENSIVE? I DID NOT GET THAT MUCH!!

Because you are too stupid to read or do basic math. "
you just freed him of a life of pain 
"Also, the customer probably feels like an idiot for blowing his namedrop on something as easily resolved as a cashed check. He'll have to do some big favors for the marketing manager before he can use his name again and not appear like a wimp or a moocher. "
"&gt; The old woman looked at him in shock, and as the cashier walked over to pick it up, (too shocked himself to really react properly) the old man ran over to him with supernatural speed, and slapped the carton out of his hands. The cashier tried to pick it up again, and the old man DID IT AGAIN.
OM: I JUST TOLD YOU WE'RE NOT BUYING IT!

Oh yes, excuse me, we'll just leave this fucking carton of ice cream laying on the ground creating a hazard that people could trip over and let it melt and be forced to throw out a perfectly fine carton of ice cream just because you're a fucking shriveled up cock gobbler who acts like a jackass in public!"
"My roommate leaves his wallet in the apartment 90% of the time. Doesn't take it to work, class, anything. I don't understand it"
"""Maybe you're done shopping...""

That's the most chill GTFO I ever saw."
(side eyeing the current U.S. administration) I dunno...
I really hope your colleague didn't sell her that certificate and just bluffed her out of the store.
"I work in a children's clothing store. The amount of times I have had to go through this is too damn high. We are supposed to ask the reason for the return after being hit with this I just don't anymore. I've had one where a woman came in with her child and when asked the reason she said ""the doctors say he won't live long enough for him to need them"" absolutely crushed us. Especially having to look at the sweet guy in the stroller while processing it.
"
"I find it hillarious when a customer name drops. I work as a mechanic for a national corporate owned repair chain. My favorites are ""I know the owner"" (founder of the company died in like 1948)  ""wow he died like 70 years ago, you look great for your age""(usually when talking to someone in their 30s) or I know(former store manager that retired in 2007) ""sorry sir he no longer works here, I hear he's a boat captain now and runs charters on his boat if you want him for that"""
The shuttlecock is the projectile in badminton. You might also call it a birdie. 
"It's not that .45 is ""too much money."" The lady thinks she is proving a point to you and sticking it to the business you work for. The lady is wrong. People like this are funny."

"I think she believed i was calling him on company time. 

Now i want to actually call him and tell him she's a bitch and he should move on. "
"You were closed for 35 minutes. Thirty. Five. Minutes. Why the hell would your manager let them in?! How long did they end up staying and spending, and how late did you end up having to stay as a result?"
Plot twist: His son is also his wife
ALL THE TIME!
Did she at least try the Jedi hand wave when she said it?
Did you tell her not to touch you?  I don't understand customers thinking they can do this!
Probably the same reason why she asked me three times how to eject the flash drive from her computer...
She's breaking them because she's not good at Badminton. They break from being hit broadside after being lobbed.  
"Yeah, but my version rhymes."
"I bet if you crushed a paper towel in a hydraulic press or something, the result would not be nearly as useful around the house. But it's not like dropping it on the floor would be enough."
"I once had someone try to pull this crap with alcohol. I stared them dead in the face and said ""So what time should I stop by?""

They were perplexed. I continued ""Well, since I'll be losing my job by selling this to you, I figure the least you could do is put me up in your house until I find a new one.""

Suffice it to say, they didn't get their alcohol."
"Don't even get me started on having to deny returns. It's a firm 30 days with receipt or transaction lookup. Period. 

I have had so many articles of clothing thrown at me, accompanied by the ""well, just keep this then it's of no use to me now"". 

People stink. "
Sorry ma'am but we are not a library. 
"No Ms. Bond, I expect you to die!"
