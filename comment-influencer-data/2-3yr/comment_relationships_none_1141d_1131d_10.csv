"It might not be just that. People with incredibly low self-esteem can seem the best friend because they'll agree with everything, even while they shove themselves under the mat. And then when they've got a new person to focus on. So unfortunately some of the things that may have made the friendship good, was because her shitty friend wasn't being true to herself. Who knows what she's really like?

You don't know until she decides to grow and not put someone else before herself."
"I think that's the main issue here!! The stuff that got taken to goodwill is probably gone forever. But the stuff traded to friends could be easily taken back! The GF is prioritizing her own social capital over making things right with her BF, clear as day. "
"&gt;them saying ""you're just embarrassed by your parents! you don't like us! etc, etc""

This is a pretty classic manipulation tactic; it's supposed to simultaneously derail the conversation (while you defend yourself and say it's not true) AND make you feel guilty. 

So here's an idea: you say to your parents ""I'm not comfortable with you posting about me so much on social media. I've asked you several times to stop posting about my personal life. If you can't stop posting, I am going to have to stop telling you what's going on in my life.""

""But you don't love us!""

""I'm sorry you feel that way. But, I need you to stop posting about my private life on social media.""

""You're just embarrassed by us!""

""I'm embarrassed by your frequent posts sharing my private information, so I am asking you to stop.""

You know, and *they* know, that whatever things they say to guilt you are unreasonable and untrue. So you don't need to argue with them. Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain.) Just set your boundary and keep it.

If they keep posting about you on social media, then it's time for an information diet. They can't post what they don't know. So, stop telling them about your daily activities, pending decisions, etc. If they ask for this information, you can act like they didn't ask, you can change the subject, you can even say ""I'm not giving you personal information anymore, remember?"" 

Remember: you aren't really hurting their feelings, even if they say you are. You are setting a boundary about *your life*, and if they are upset, it is because they aren't getting what they want, not because they are hurt. Also remember that they have no hesitation about hurting *your* feelings in this matter. 

Good luck!

"Way less likely, though. Drug addiction is way more common than rich old guys marrying young women. Also, if he really is that rich, he's probably going to have a prenup/will so that his kids get most of his wealth, not the new wife."
"Hi, OP. I'm a newish mom so I'm coming at this from a sentimental place, but bear with me. 

You're your mom's first kid, and even though you're fourteen, she still looks at you and sees the tiny baby you used to be, and she is going to have a hard time letting you go, even if it is in your best interest. It does sound like your dad's place might be better for you, and you can try to persuade her, but be gentle. I'm sure it breaks her heart to think of you leaving. It's the tough part of what happens when two loving parents divorce - someone is always going to miss out on time with their little one."
"&gt; Has he been cheated on in a previous relationship? It's possible that is clouding his judgement now.

or he could be projecting cause he has cheated before. happens a lot too. either way at 6 months in this would be a deal breaker for me, honestly. but to be fair i'm absolutely allergic to men telling me what to do based on their own insecurities so take my opinion with a grain of salt."
"I guess... I don't want to say it seemed normal. We were fighting over the television. I like Law and Order svu (it's a guilty pleasure) and he just thought it was so stupid and vapid American television. So one time he just started yelling that it was on and I started snapping back and he wanted to leave the house and I pulled on his arm to get him to stay and he just turned around and choked me. We fell to the floor and he smacked my head against it a couple of times and left me there and I was dazed and got up. and it was horrifying and I guess I just immediately tried to justify it because he started crying about how this relationship was making him a monster and I said, no it was my fault I didn't let you go.

I grew up with a mother who was, well, a little physically abusive so in my brain it didn't seem... so out of the norm. But reading everyone's posts make me think that I'm just fooling myself."

He could also be taking it out on his little sister just because she's there.
"&gt; she is a thousand times the person Irina will ever be

This is a very good start in what you should tell her. Tell her how you feel about her. Reassure her that you would take her over Irina any day. And go from there."
"Oh no, not tattooed! He must be a jerk!"
"I'm living this right now.  My ex was never close to our two teens, so when he walked out and pretty much went MIA for 5 months, they really didn't notice he was absent.  By the time he popped back in, expecting to pick up where he'd left off, he'd met a long-distance girlfriend who lives on another continent.  He's spent the past two years cancelling as many visits as he shows up for, and the kids have had it.  He's eager to have them for the full visitation weekends (when he's around), but he's lucky if the kids agree to meet him for anything more than lunch, and he resents me because I refuse to force them (18M, 14F).  He spends an average of 10-12 hours/month with them.  

What I hear from him, however, is how I'm obviously poisoning them against him, and that cancelling visits to travel with his girlfriend wouldn't be a problem if I'd just teach them to be more flexible.  I have no doubt he blames me for alienating the kids; I have the emails accusing me of such.  Because I'm still friendly with his family, I know that when he shows up to events alone he tells everyone I wouldn't let the kids come, when in truth he's never asked me.  Heck, there was one family event he was planning to take our son, but called up the night before to say he'd decided to go with his girlfriend instead, then told everyone our son wasn't able to make it because he had other plans.  I don't need to do anything to alienate him; he's doing a good enough job on his own.

I know his girlfriend blames me for interfering because she sent me an email begging me to force the kids into visits, moaning about how important it is for the kids to have a father.  It wouldn't surprise me if she writes a similar letter to OP's in a couple of years."
"&gt;  I don't even want to think about how big or expensive that would be! Outrageous!

I looked it up and the simplest solitaire on their website only goes up to 2.5ct and it's quoted at $55,500."
"Not all of those YouTube channels use paid actresses. I was approached by a guy from a yt channel for a very similar thing and I told him I had a boyfriend. I'm not a paid actress and none of the other girls were either. OP's girlfriend most definitely had the choice, but she cheated. "
"Yes usually, but not always. Two of the children I taught also exhibited their mutism at home. One would only speak when wearing dress ups and costumes for most of a year - at school and home. The other was later assessed as displaying traits of giftedness and started speaking for the first time at the age of 6 at a level well above her age. She displayed other examples of perfectionism too. "
"Causing drama by flaunting her good fortune?

If you go from a 50k job to a 100k job, you're going to be able to buy nicer things and go to nicer places. You shouldn't not take advantage of that because your friends will get their irrational feelings hurt. 

It doesn't sound like she walking around with a pay stub and waving it in everyone's faces, she probably just bought a Prada bag and everyone is mad that they can't afford to get one. "
"But what's the difference between her borrowing the car for this hobby, rather than for another? 



I don't disagree with you here - I'm just saying you might need to think through your reasons before talking to her again because it can seem like you are saying no only because you dislike that she plays the game. "
"I guarantee she knows what she did is wrong. She's jealous of OP and showed that by disrespecting her ""neat-freak ways"" she always makes fun of. "
"Having fingers placed in the vagina without warning, without foreplay, is about the cringiest, most unarousing thing ever. If he needs help understanding, ask him if he'd like fingers put into his unsuspecting butthole during a massage. (Some people may like that - who knows. This could backfire!)

I get that he's frustrated, but that wasn't cool, and you need to make sure he knows that. Not only was it wrong to do, but it's just not an effective strategy to convince women to have sex. Be very clear that when you say no, that's it, and it's not something he can bargain over with an impromptu gynecological exam. 

I get why sexy nudes and cyber sex bother you, but I do think you two need to maintain the sexual spark and connection during your off times. Is there something you would feel comfortable doing?"
"&gt;Honestly, any 36M that chooses to want to be friendly with a 24F strikes me as odd

I don't agree with that, I'm kind of in the middle of those ages at 30 and I've friends ranging from 24 to 37 who also are friends with each other."
"OP, speaking to your edit, I really do not think you understand the overall issue going on here. Yes, you are happily engaged and all that jazz, but if you want this relationship to survive a marriage, you need to learn how to communicate with your fiance when issues arise. Instead, you said nothing to him and ignored any possible underlying issues. Maybe your fiance is truly a clueless FF goof or maybe he does not understand how to take your wants into consideration. Either way, you really should listen to this advice and those of the other redditors before you enter marriage. It sounds like you and your fiance have a lot to learn about the fundamentals of marriage before saying ""I do."""
"I'm so sorry, I have to do this, my mom was a newspaper editor for like 20 years. I am prepared for downvotes:

Lede* buried"
"I'm so sorry. That sounds really tough to navigate. But please don't commit to a life of insecurity due to the sunken cost fallacy. You are a strong, beautiful and independent person, you'll still be that person if you break up... And hopefully your family will come around if you do just like they did this time. 

Remember, there's a different story to tell here than the fall of the sinner. There's the story of a woman strong enough to do what makes her happy. Hopefully your family will see that too, and if not, your happiness still comes first. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with an open relationship if that is what both people want, but if you don't, please don't allow yourself to be forced into one. The fact that he says you have to be open to it if he suddenly one day ""reaches that point"" is worrying... Because once your married you'll have even more pressure to stay and give in. 

I think there are few true deal breakers, but whether you want to open the relationship or not is one of them. "
"I don't see you mentioning anything your wife does just because she likes to do it, even if it contributes nothing to keeping the house running. Can you clarify what time she has for her own hobbies and interests?"
"Speaking from experience re: no contact: when I started dating my biracial (black and white) now-husband in college, I found out from my mother that my father told her he didn't like me dating a black guy. I confronted him, of course, and he gave me the typical, racist ""I like black people, I have black friends, I just don't want them to date my daughter"" bullshit, and made some other gross comments as well. Funnily, he also brought up how he wishes I'd date an Italian because that's ""our"" culture, when my mom is Jewish. My parents are divorced, and he was never a great parent to say the least, but that was the last straw for me. It really revealed a side of him that I wanted absolutely nothing to do with. 

It's been more than 8 years since I told him I would not speak to him ever again, and I have no intention of reconnecting with him. I've been with my husband 9, and we married last year. 

/u/JenniferDeJong stand by your daughter, and respect that this very well may change her views of her father permanently, whether she ends up marrying Kenton or not. This is a very ugly, cruel side of who he is, and she has every right to do with that knowledge what she will. And understand that if you don't stand by her, this could very well affect your relationship with her as well.

Edit: I can't word right sometimes"
"&gt; He says that he was going through some personal things


Transaltion: ""I was also talking to another girl but that didn't work out so I'm back knocking on your door"". Even if it wasn't that, he could have easily given you the heads up that he needed time instead of ghosting you. That's why I think his response if full of shit."

"So the parts I didn't find weird: 

- Sharing a bed
- Cuddling
- Spending time together
- Travel

But it gets weird in context of how he treats his girlfriend. When you have a partner and choose to sleep with your sister instead of talk, pretend to be married, buy a romance suite and then use it to mock your partner... that is the weird part. 

I know plenty of siblings who remain close until they find a romantic partner, then some things becomes an ""us"" thing and not a ""family"" thing."

"&gt; We are going to therapy still, so I think part of her wants it to work, but I'm worried she is just trying to keep the peace till she feels it's the best time to divorce.

Yes, this is exactly what she's doing. She went out and found someone else who takes care of himself, seems to have self-confidence, and makes her feel exciting again. She's checked out completely already and it sounds as though no amount of effort you make is going to change things. The fact that she blew up at you sitting alone at the party and using that as grounds for divorce means there's MUCH more going on here, and she's ready to move forward in life without you.

So sorry. :( Time to find a lawyer, and start preparing your new life. "
Well you should probably tell you mother before she walks into an ambush by Jesus freaks unprepared. But I'm not sure if she would take your advice and not attend the party. Babies are a powerful motivator. And she might try to convince you to go with her to the party. On the other hand keeping secrets like this could ruin your relationship with your mother. And if the party goes bad and you warned her you might have an easier time to get her to pull away from your sister.
"This is very strange behavior.  How does this even come up in conversation with Dave?  I have never said to ANY of my FRIENDS EVER ""Hey, it would be cool to go cat fishing yea?""

Don't let fear encourage you to accept shabby treatment. :) 
"Yeah, it's gotten to the point where I have anxiety when I'm invited to something :/ even this weekend we discussed I had plans, then I'm the worst person for following through on those plans. Even worse, that I didn't text her while I was out. I'm really trying hard to not lose friends while figuring this out, and I can tell she resents every activity that doesn't involve her.

We went to counseling once and she revealed that she feels like I am consistently on the edge of leaving her. I really don't know where that comes from. The counselor told her to have faith and to stop saying things are ok if they really aren't. She hasn't followed through with that. I've pursued my own therapy just from the stress of everything in general.

We both work full-time now, and that's a huge issue. I can't focus on my work by sending her cutesy messages all day, then risk her becoming upset because I didn't respond as fast as she would like."

"Hey, hold on in there, you seem to be having a hard time :( 

But listen, the words you use are a bit strong: ""prove"", ""accuse"", ""guilty"" etc. You don't ""accuse"" someone of being gay (you might ""suggest"" it). You ""accuse"" people of being thieves, liars, cheaters, bullies etc. Being gay is simply a sexual preference and there is nothing bad with it, so I would never use these words to talk about the issue. 

Think about whether you would use the same words about someone being straight. Would you say someone was ""accused"" of being straight? If not, try to think why you use these same words about a gay sexuality.

The fact that you seem to be so negative about the notion that you might be gay tells me that _if_ you were, you would have a very hard time accepting it, and you'd pretty much write the exact same post you wrote now. In order to really know yourself you really need to be free of prejudice. 

I am not challenging your claim that you are straight (although I believe that everyone has even a tiny gay side to them, it just varies from person to person!). I am simply suggesting that your problem might not be that people mistakenly think you are gay, but that you are convinced that being gay would be such a bad thing. If you tried to see that being straight or gay has nothing to do with how awesome you may be as a person, then maybe you wouldn't spend all your effort and energy trying to hook up with girls you don't even particularly like, just so you can prove to the world how manly you are. Instead you'd lay back and enjoy doing your own thing and when people suggested you were gay instead of flipping out you'd just laugh and tell them ""hah, that would be seriously all sorts of cool and interesting, but sadly I'm really straight :)"".

On a side-note, you don't _have_ to date if you don't want to. It has nothing to do with whether you like men or women. A lot of straight people prefer not having a partner for long periods of their lives. Others are very particular on what their partner would be like, and they actually prefer being alone over settling for something less than their ideal. It's all fine. You don't owe anyone explanations for your personal life choices.

"I mean... it may help, but probably it'll be negligible. The best way to lose weight is to just stop putting so much stuff in your face. Has she been sneaking food? Do you two tend to eat the same amount at meals? If there's a significant height difference between you two, she might accidentally be eating too much. "
"&gt;  am not sure you read the whole post. I put this in a post a few times but it bares repeating. My fiance is an amazing person. She would politely let him come if I told her it meant more to me that he come. She would wear her pretty dress and pretend she was ok but she wouldn't be. I know her. She is nice to a fault. But I know it would hurt her. She would knowingly put her feelings above that of someone else
&gt; Why would I ever reconsider my wedding to a person like that?
&gt; And she would never ask me to stop seeing him. She just doesn't want to be personal friends with him or his wife. She said she would be more than polite to them. She just wants her wedding to be about her.
&gt; But I want him and her there, and I want both of them to enjoy it. She would let him come but I'd look in her eyes and know she was miserable with him there on her day.

I wrote it to the above comment but it applies more here.

&gt;Honestly, I think that any bride who's more focused on a particular guest than on the person she's marrying at her ceremony probably isn't the kind of person I'd want to marry.

You are just wrong. And I feel like you didn't read my post at all."
"Neither, but I see your point."
"I have told them that before I made the money that changed things for me, I worked 2 jobs in addition to studying, even the money I made, I worked hard for that and didn't expect that I'd make a large amount like I did. Basically I was pointing out that I worked for what I have and so should they. No I didn't give them any money, I don't mind giving them a thousand a month or so but they'd finish it quickly with how much they go out so that's out of the question. "
"Sorry it's me again. 

I've been thinking about this situation and I wonder as a compromise if your fiance would consider getting the pendants professionally framed together? That way you could display them in your home and you would always have the memory of them to look at, show to guests and so on. "
"Your boyfriend didn't do anything wrong and he doesn't owe you a lifestyle because he makes more money. If you want to talk about moving, you need to talk about this sober. If you wanted to see him during the weekend, you could have. You failed to communicate and are basically mad at yourself. He didn't get rowdy this weekend or do any of the things he has done drunk previously that could have given you any sense of vindication here. You need to apologize. "
Dude I can't do it. I just can't. I'm 33 and I've put in about the hours worth of 30 years of full time work already. I can't do this anymore. I need to sleep well and relax and take care of myself.
It sounds like you are the only one with a problem with it?   If nobody else cares why tell them no?
"I'm pretty sure from context OP's girlfriend was lying about forgetting, but I wish people here didn't push the misogynistic narrative that a birth control failure ALWAYS represents a manipulative lie on the part of the woman. Birth control *fails* sometimes and sometimes people really *do* forget. I have ADHD and I've forgotten for days while having no interest in pregnancy. In my case, luckily no pregnancy resulted and I switched to a more mistake-proof form of contraception but if it had failed before I did it would have been a genuine accident. "

"The parents are probably just as nervous as you, but also really excited! They probably worry you won't like them or that they won't do everything right.

Three years during which you never had a conversation lasting more than 5 minutes. Three years after which you couldn't tell us what music she likes. Three years of having to force her to interact with you. Doesn't sound like a mother. **And that's because you're not her mother.**
well if you're only 5 months in and he insists that you're a weirdo for this then maybe your initial reaction was right and you should go look for a more open minded person. for what it's worth: i live in a laundry room (it has lots of windows though!) and i have a mattress that i just push up and lean against the wall every morning so it's not in the way. no guy i brought home ever complained about it and i think that's much weirder than what you're doing. so open minded men are definitely out there and you shouldn't feel weird for living the way you want to :)

"I understand completely.  

I knew I was serious about my husband the first time he stayed over for a weekend and I WASN'T relieved to see him leave by Sunday. I thought I was ready to move in. I wasn't.  To add stress to the mix, I have a needy child and a clingy dog too.  I used to look forward to the quiet times after kiddo went to bed, but after my husband moved in, those times were gone.   It doesn't help that he doesn't really have any other friends, and I am his SOLE source of social contact. Like your boyfriend, he used to follow me into the bathroom.  

The ways I deal with it:

- First: I go out for some ""me time"" a couple nights a month.  He thinks I go to a local coffee shop to write, but even that is too much people for me.  More often than not I find a place where I can access the free wifi from outside and sit in my car and reddit or read for a while. 

- Second: I was VERY clear to the point of rudeness that bathroom time is alone time. It doesn't matter if all I am doing in there is brushing my teeth. The door stays closed and locked except in the case of a potty emergency, but in those situations he MUST allow me to vacate our tiny bathroom before HE evacuates. 

- Third: I explained that I need quiet time to myself to not be a major bitch face.  He didn't understand it at first because, even though he is an introvert, I don't give him that ""tired"" feeling he gets around other people.  I love him, I love my son, I love my dog, but there isn't a single person or animal on this PLANET that I want to be around all the time. It helped him to understand that my feelings weren't personal. It isn't an aversion to HIM specifically, it's just how I'm wired.  We worked out a system that he understands but doesn't require me to specifically SAY I want to be left alone. I have some noise cancelling headphones and when they're on, he knows it's my own ""Do Not Disturb"" sign. Of course if he needs to talk to me about something important, he can, but it signals that trivial stuff and general conversation should wait. 

- Lastly: I really do recommend noise-cancelling headphones. The high-quality over-ear types. It helps create an illusion of isolation even when there is someone else in the room and I find it immensely helpful."
"Give him time. My husband hit a cat once while we were driving. We saw it, we slowed down, swerved to the side, and it still ran right directly into the tire. I got out and made sure the thing was dead, but if it wasn't, I would have done that dirty work. He was so, so torn up about it. 

As much as it hurt to see him hurt, it made me love him all the more to see how upset he was over this little life that he never even knew. Not everyone has that kind of compassion. Give him hugs. "

"Getting an IUD is not a solution to your boyfriend not ""allowing"" you to be on BC. Breaking up with him is. This is likely the beginning of a pattern of manipulation and control. If at four months he is allowed to control what medications you take, what will he decide he is allowed to control at 6 months? A year? This is your personal medical choice. The problem isn't so much really even about the birth control, it is about his inappropriate and deplorable behavior."
"Hi, thanks for this response, it really means a lot.

Because it's a small start up in a male-dominated environment, I definitely agree that escalating the scenario to HR will only come back to bite me. The HR head themselves would probably think i was being a ""silly girl"" if I had to involve a higher-up to handle the problem. It's almost like conceding to their assumptions, in a sense. No one at my company in the States is exceptionally PC and all have a bit of crass humor. It doesn't bother me so much, I guess that I just did not expect my first interaction with someone I just met to be so influenced by my gender. My boss before this was a woman (she retired), and this is my first job out of college. 
Like you were saying, for every jerk there are one or two great colleagues who don't let being a girl define you. This is definitely the case, and I am lucky because a couple colleagues my age also find the Boss saying ignorant genderless statements to them (One of my coworkers was a d1 basketball player and Boss treats him like he doesn't have two cells between his head).

So thank you for pointing me to that.

I will work on not letting it get to me, it will probably just serve me better to be able to dismantle these comments in real-time. Even Lauren (a chemical engineer in the company) responded to him by just rolling her eyes and telling him that she would let him borrow a dress so that he could feel as good about himself as she does. She threw in a little zinger about him needing a few sizes bigger. She is probably used to these comments as well, but has mastered deflecting them. 

Your comment was really inspiring, so thank you a bunch! "
"Consider yourself lucky that she only got you for $400. I know people who have been screwed out of a lot worse. You were extremely generous offering to pay for 25% of her rent in the first place and she should be happy you did (did she even thank you?), however, now she has the audacity to DEMAND another $400? She's been dating you for a few weeks, she doesn't get to demand money from you. Shit, I've been dating a girl for 3 years and she doesn't get to demand money from me. Fuck, my dads been married for almost 30 years and my mom doesn't get to demand money from him (she can occasionally ask, and he's always happy to give, but it's never a demand). You need to get the fuck out of there bro"
PLease tell me that piece of shit was arrested.
I like this- gracious as possibly while still being broadly true. Classy as.
"Actually, that's a damn good point."
"&gt; Maybe it is hormones and will pass, maybe not

As someone who is currently pregnant, I can say that I had thoughts about not being pregnant anymore, especially when I was really sick all the time. There were some days where I kind of wished that I magically wasn't pregnant anymore because I felt so bleh and waiting another 7 to 6 months to actually have the baby felt too hard. That eventually passed and now I'm perfectly content with my pregnancy and my husband and I are both very excited about it. Hormones will do very weird things to you. Hopefully this is just a weird phase OP's wife is going through and not the end of their relationship."

"One of my bridesmaids was 9 months pregnant on my wedding day. I asked her how she felt about it beforehand and she wouldn't miss it for the world unless she was in labor of course. 

Day of, all eyes were on me as the bride. She looked absolutely beautiful as did the rest of the bridal party, but she didn't steal the show or anything. Our photos came back and you honestly barely notice, and when we do point it out it's a happy moment to remember for us as well!"
"It may or may not.  If it's using GPS, there's a decent chance that it will give you a good idea of which apartment he was in.  I just opened up my phone and used GPS on Google Maps, and it showed correctly which room in my house I was in, based on the overhead photos that GMaps has.

But if he's gone there once, he'll probably ""have to work late"" and then go there again.  The way to be *sure* is to go there and wait outside for him.  Then you'll know."
Doxxing is harassment even if it only happens once.

"We had a cat. My mom had a cat. My nephews developed crazy bad allergies and couldn't go to grandma's house anymore so my mom (very reluctantly) asked us if we would take her kitty.

This situation is 100% their faults. 
"&gt; It might not be a slam dunk case, but I'm sure an employment lawyer would at least start drooling a little bit over it.

Former lawyer who did a couple of labor law cases: no, not drool-worthy. Really not. Not any evidence to show that there was gender bias. Just think about it: there is no way people can sue when a person of one gender is replaced by a person of another gender.  That is just a normal, typical thing which occurs. You would need more, like explicit remarks made by the firer/hirer which show a clear bias, to make a case worth doing anything with.

And in this case we know the father wasn't motivated out of a gender bias. He would have hired those stepkids if they were boys or one boy &amp; one girl.

"Indeed, there is a point where you have to call it quits. I think OP has done what she could to salvage a failed relationship. Life is too short to wait for things to happen."
Make the kids go with your last name. Maybe the kids will stop talking to you to avoid the difficulty. 
"&gt;She wanted help from the husband and he took more shifts at work for money.

That's helping...if they're 20 with 3 kids, I assure you they were broke. He's not the villain just because he is the dad."
"OP, can you expand on what happened in the past?  It appears in the comments that you are second only to Jesus in your purity and your SO is insane.  Do you have a habit of going out with guys and getting drunk?  Have you lied to your SO about going out with guys ""so you don't get into a fight""?  Have you omitted going out with guys so you ""don't start a fight""?  Do any of your ""friends"" have a crush on you or have you had ANY type of relationship with any of them in the past?  

If there is litterally NOTHING at all in your relationship's history to bring this on (i mean really nothing, not ""well i don't consider that important or an issue"") then your SO is over reacting with his demands.  That doesn't mean that he is wrong to be very hurt and pissed.  You fucked up in a HUGE way and ""nothing happened"" has litteral fuckall to do with it.  

Also, just a heads up, but ""nothing happened"" ... ""but but but, nothing happened"" isn't a very good way to approach your SO being upset.  ""Nothing happened"" can be shouted all day long and will accomplish nothing at all.  ""I'm sorry"" and ""I know i fucked up"", and possibly ""I can fix this (insert YOUR suggested fix to rebuilding trust)"" are much better ways to showing you are sorry and know you fucked up.  Seriously, ""nothing happened"" is also one of the most common statements when something DID happen.  "
"See if you can maybe rely on friends/family to help you take them over for a bit until you are on your feet, or cancel the services you don't need. YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THIS DUDE. He is abusing you, and it will only get worse from here. loveisrespect.org "
"&gt; It sounds like your wife is having trouble adjusting to the idea that she's the breadwinner. 

In fairness to OP's wife, being the breadwinner for *3 adults and 2 children*, as well as actually **paying one of those adults a salary** is a hell of a lot of pressure that would frustrate and stress even the most calm, rational person. 

OP seems to insist that because the current setup is fine for *him*, his wife must also think it's fine and couldn't possibly be stressed.

It may not be the socially acceptable way to think, but having to be the breadwinner for your husband, while paying someone else to do the work at home that he cannot do, and then having him tell you that he needs more support and that he is depressed (while you are the only person actually keeping the entire family from being homeless and destitute) is going to be incredibly frustrating and insulting. 

Even if OP's wife fully accepts that his depression is a genuine problem, that doesn't mean she can't be frustrated at finding out that the husband who gives her no support and cannot understand that she might be stressed is suddenly insisting that he needs more support."
Do the guys you slept with also make you sick because they actively pursued sex? Honest question.
"Right. But he also would have been mad at you for getting pregnant in the first place. 

**The man is manipulating you.** He is putting you in a box where nothing you do is right. 

Somebody fundamentally can not say, ""I will hurt you if you do X,"" and then, ""You should come to me if X happens."" There is no world where those two statements are okay together. The first completely engages the second. 

What he is doing feels to me like an example of psychological abuse, like he is trying to make you completely dependent on his judgement and support. 

You haven't done anything wrong here, and every time he so much as implies as much, he's being an a-hole. 

DTMFA. 

If his reaction was, ""Oh, shit, and you probably felt you couldn't come to me because of those things I said, I'm so sorry."" you might be able to consider remaining with him. 

But putting this on you? That is some serious bullshit. Dump him. Now. "
"Well congrats, you succeeded.  Your siblings are just collateral damage I guess.

One day your siblings will rightfully blame you for ruining their relationship with their mom and her dying without seeing them because you enjoy inflicting pain.

This is your last chance to do right.  Take it."
Then I guess we're not in agreement. I would fuck SIL over as politely as possible if I were in OP's shoes.
"&gt; Discipline them when they hear it 

That's what she wants him to do.  He is refusing to even ask the boys to stop saying those things, as he doesn't seem to think there is anything wrong with what the boys are saying.  He *laughed* in her face when she asked him to address it with them."
"From another woman - Your girlfriend is way, way over the line controlling here.  I think that she is into the area of abusing you emotionally.  

This reminds me of a selfish, manipulative, controlling *former* friend of mine, who got upset that her husband was jacking off during his morning shower.  She discussed this with all of her friends, and also her *mother*.  

I fear that your gf may get more and more controlling as time goes by, OP.  You need to ditch her, and find someone who cares about your normal, healthy needs."

Maybe you could bring up the reasons you don't want children. Ask her ""why did we choose to not have kids?"" I assume the reasons are something like -- *they can be unruly*, caring for them is expensive, *they have to be watched almost constantly*, they sometimes puke on the carpet.

Taking care of a dog is high maintenance. Be firm, friend. "

"They are still approaching you out of good intentions, I'm sure, and not a sense of your ""obligation"" to the church. They still love you and want you around in your ""old"" capacity. That's why they are answering that they don't *mind* you're no longer ""officially"" needed. 

You are wanted. So, respond with kindness and positivity, like ""thank you so much for thinking of me. I'm a lot busier these days and won't be able to make it."" Etc."
"Tough shit. He has to pay child support no matter if he wanted it or not. Did you put his name on the birth certificate? Even if you didn't, you can (and must) get a court order establishing paternity and a child support schedule. 

One thing to keep in mind about child support is that it's not for you, it's for the child. So even if you feel guilty about making him pay, you need to think of your baby. The money he can contribute can buy your daughter clothes, food, and medicine. She deserves to be supported. 

There is nothing wrong with contacting his parents. They are the child's grandparents -- and they can enrich your daughter's life. If they live nearby, they can also maybe provide some support as you seem to be struggling. This might be easier to do after you establish paternity through the court order. 

Finally, make sure you get screened for postpartum depression. 

But absolutely make sure he pays child support -- and DON'T accept a verbal agreement from him. Get a court order that establishes the amount and the schedule.

"Its over, dude. Lawyer up. Dont leave your home"
"I just don't understand why people subscribe to that idea. Having a job *isn't an option*. You have to do something, and sometimes all you can get is a shitty job that leaves you broke and that you hate going to. Just because someone is getting paid doesn't mean they aren't struggling! I really want people to realize this and I'm glad your boyfriend grew up thanks to you. "
It was indecent if you to pursue him while she was trying to work things out without even giving her a heads up. She has every right to be upset. But that's all she gets. Holding a grudge for 20 years and badmouthing you is childish. She must learn to move on.
"This will not solve her co-dependency problems, but what if you suggested she hire a personal assistant with the money that used to be your ""salary""? Someone who can help her out with her businesses &amp; keep her company.

Ideally she could just go out &amp; make her own friends that share her interests, but she sounds like she might not have the world's greatest social skills, so a friendly-employee could be a good starter?

If she has some undiagnosed social anxiety, maybe it would make her more comfortable to introduce some friends a few at a time that she can get to know better in a less threatening environment., Like invite a couple over for dinner or a night of wine &amp; board games or a movie at your place?

It seems unsustainable for both of you to keep doing your own thing without compromise. What she wants makes you miserable, what you want makes her miserable. If you can't find a middle ground this relationship won't survive."
"&gt;I think if she has the kid in the UK shes basically got a free pass to stay

Unfortunately this is not true. I posted this below but I'm gonna hijack this comment so this doesn't get buried.  

&gt;You need to speak to an immigration lawyer ASAP. As the law stands in the UK, your son cannot sponsor her for a visa or settlement in the UK unless they are married and he personally has an annual income of £18,600, or £16,000 plus £6,500 in savings. You cannot make up any of this as a third party sponsor. Having a child who is a UK citizen will not help her.
&gt;
&gt;This is an extremely dark part of UK immigration law and is currently the subject of a supreme court challenge, after the case against the law was rejected by the court of appeals.
If her parents have truly abandoned her, you need to move fast and maybe find some way you could take guardianship and sponsor her as a child or something (I have no idea if anything like this is even possible at this stage). Otherwise she will end up on a plane to Canada and either she or your son will have to be responsible for the child without the other.
&gt;
&gt;Canada may less restrictive immigration rules (the UK is the worst in the world in this regard), and he may have to settle there with her if they're going to raise a child together."
"I'd say that the relationship is hardly doomed. He is 24 and can quite easily have a conversation with her father to the tune of ""I get how people can mistake some Muslims for all Muslims, but that's like comparing Pentecostal Snake Handlers to Catholics. Sure they worship the same god, but have entirely different beliefs on how they should live life.""

Then probably go into how many radicalists have a problem with society, and turn to ISIS and terrorism because they see it as the only way to make a name for themselves, much like youths turning to gang culture, because they've had a hard life, and someone comes around and tells them how much better they can have it if they join up."
"This is awful and this is something your Dad needs to step up and handle. The circumstances of your birth are not your responsibility.

The fact that this has been going on so long without your Dad putting an end to it is shameful. 

It's not your fault OP. You can't change other people's feelings. Talk CALMLY to your Dad. Perhaps write out your feelings first so you can explain things calmly and rationally, write down these and other examples like this. "
"This sounds like an insurmountable incompatibility between the two of you--and you've both dug your feet in--and you're both right to think how you do.  Honestly, if I was him, my SO wanting to adopt would be a dealbreaker.  I want biological children, and I don't want to adopt a child unless my SO of years and years was sterile.  I'm also in my 30s and know more of what I want out of life than I did at 20.

You're 20, he's 21, you're both too young to settle for such a huge incompatibility.  I don't know how you made it to engagement before settling this, but I'd come to a mutual decision before moving forward in your relationship.  It really sounds like a breakup waiting to happen.  Next time, ask the important questions sooner."
"Well, potentially sexism aside, it does sound like you were being a dick.  Mind you, if your girlfriend had been frequently asking you to buy her stuff without contributing to any of the purchases herself then, yeah, you'd be perfectly justified saying that you don't want to pay for stuff.  But according to your post, you share the purchases pretty evenly and the only reason she needed your money was because she forgot her wallet, so it doesn't sound like she was out of line asking you to cover her for that one day.  Supposedly if you forgot your wallet sometime in the future, she'd cover you, right?  I think that's a reasonable thing to expect from someone you've been with for two years.

So put yourself in her shoes.  Picture if you'd gone out somewhere and forgotten your wallet.  You see something cool and cheap that you want so you ask if your girlfriend can cover it.  You tend to split purchases anyways, right?  Well, she lets you know that while she does have enough money, she's still not going to buy it for you.  Because *she* doesn't want you to have it at the moment, despite the fact that it she knows it would make you happy.  Wouldn't you be at least a little pissed off?

Okay, now multiply that by ten.  Why?  Because you *know* she's been wanting to eat healthier.  What does that say to you about her body image?  Probably that she wants to lose some weight, right?  How do you think it makes her feel that her boyfriend is essentially making unilateral choices about her diet ""for her own good""?  Basically, through your actions, you're inadvertently telling her, ""You're fat and you don't know what's good for yourself.""  So you've made someone who already feels potentially shitty and insecure feel even more shitty and insecure.  I know this wasn't your intention, but as a woman I can tell you, that's the sort of thing we're likely to take away from something like that.

You should apologize to your girlfriend."
That doesn't explain the OkC thing though.
"Well done on breaking up before pursuing girl #2.  You should feel good about yourself for being a decent, honest person.

If you feel like you deserve sympathy because not being in a relationship is so horrible, that's a problem.  You should be fully capable of being happy for some length of time without being attached.  

On the other hand, if you want sympathy for it not working out with chick #2-- sure, it's always sad and maybe a bit painful when that happens. "
"Yeah, I see your point, and I don't want to discourage therapy if it seems needed. But, story:

When I was six, I got a minor injury at my father's hands - we were joking around (screaming with laughter) along the theme of ""I'll throw you out into the snow!"" and I stopped to put boots on, and as he closed the door, my pinkie got pinched in the door hinge, smashing up the fingernail to the point where it needed an ER visit and stitches.

It hurt, yes, but the pain in my finger doesn't linger in memory. What hurt about the whole thing, was watching my father be totally contrite for an extended time period, and that he basically never roughhoused with me again.


In the alternate universe where OP's daughter never met her grandmother, or had visits that were supervised every minute, she might've grown up thinking, ""why is dad so paranoid and unforgiving about granny?"" or ""does granny not want to see me (because we never visit)."" These things are not terrible, but there's an emotional downside to being fully protected from harm, rather than simply taking reasonable care against proven threats.

So, her takeaway should be something like, ""Granny was abusive to daddy, but he thought she had mellowed out as she got older, so he tried to let her get to know me. But it turns out she's still horrible, so I won't be taken to visit her again."" Not: ""daddy's trip to see granny got ruined because I was clumsy and broke a plate.""

Kids can be kind of wonky about causality, and the real lesson is, ""I'll help you stay away from people who are horrible"" not ""a single beating is so terrible that I can never forgive myself for letting it happen to you."""
So basically you aren't going to tell them to stop and your bf's insecurity will get worse as they talk more about it
"That is horrible. Actually truly horrible. He waited to have you trapped in, especially given your family situation, that is so gross. I mean that is what abusers do. 

You know that your happiness is the most important thing, and that ultimately by finding happiness you will be a true role model for your cousins. So I suggest you dump this person who is looking increasingly like an asshole the more we hear about him. "
Why didn't you address it with a conversation?
"This backs up the advice you're getting to cut your dad out but think about forgiving Lexie if you can. Nothing worse than someone who, rather than owning up to their terrible behaviour, just attempts to shift the blame."
"Yeah this... there's a huge stigma about being in therapy and how it's for ""crazy people"" and if you go there's something massively wrong with you. 

Like look, if you have a broken bone, you go to the doctor, if your computer isn't functioning, you take it to a professional. If you struggle with a learning difference in school, you hire a fucking tutor or see if you college has an on-campus tutor. When a big life event changes your mindset, you go to a professional to help you work through it. Just the same as any other issue you may have in your life. 

No one shames someone for getting their computer fixed or their car repaired... and they shouldn't for therapy, either."
"I hate to make light of your situation...but having your boyfriend only being able to fit in his rave clothes...and hanging out in them all day is hilariously ridiculous.

You need to talk to him or get out of this relationship."
"&gt;(Here's a useful thing my wife said to me: ""Whatever blame you're hearing? That's your mother's voice."" Right as usual.)

Damn."
"If the person you married, who supposedly you trust more than anyone else in the world calls you lazy, why are you dismissing that? She sees you every single day, she knows you. And she says you're lazy. Forget about being indignant about Internet strangers calling you lazy. Your life partner thinks you're lazy and you're not willing to entertain the thought that it could be true. 

Look, I get it. I have a major lazy streak in me. Left to my own devices, I bet I could lay around and watch Netflix for 10 hours a day. I'm a naturally lazy person. Oh well. But, if it's affecting my husband or family negatively, I need to step up and improve myself. I went through a funk about 2 years ago after I lost my job. Was unemployed and just let my lazy tendencies sneak up on me. My husband told me flat out he felt like I was being lazy, and he was right. I didn't deny or complain,  I looked within and improved myself. That's what you need to do. Stop being so defensive. Your wife has a point. She deserves her husband to respect her opinion, even if it's an uncomfortable truth. And I do agree, the same goes for her. She should try to listen and hear you out about your depression. But, your post and every single comment you make is all about how she needs to listen and respect what you're saying, but you categorically deny her opinions and statements. "
"So she knew when her husband was coming to pick her up and had 45 min warning before you came home and didn't clean up before leaving? Either she doesn't understand how simple time management or she did this deliberatly. She didn't want to clean so she left it a mess until she had to leave, with a vague offer to clean it later that she propably knew you were going to refuse becaise you're such a ""neat freak"" that your not going to just live in that mess until she feels like taking care of it.

She didn't want to clean, so she set it up so she wouldn't have to, simple as."
"If kids at school get wind of his visits to a 'professional', however, there's a chance they'll be absolutely fucking ruthless to him over it. These are 15 year olds we're talking about here.

Does this mean that she treats all situations like that? She got you suspended, imagine what her choices mean for her own career and life?

Then take this as your permission.

Frankly, you're allowed to break up with someone for any reason under the sun- all it requires is that you want to."

"I think it's dangerous to sidestep it. You don't want HR involved in a fuzzy situation.

You're very uncomfortable with this person, and you're uncomfortable subjecting your other employees to this kind of person.  

Hr usually runs criminal background checks and won't hire people with a violent history.  

I think the mistake is understating it. No decent hr department wants someone around who has a history of making violent threats and harrassing people. "
"I'm a black man that grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods. Because of this, a majority of my friends (women included) were white. However, my parents explained to me early on that though other adults may accept me as a friend of their child, those feelings would change if the relationship became romantic. Kenton sounds a lot like me as a HS kid and I will say he most definitely knows what your husband means with his coded language. 

As a parent, this should be a teaching opportunity to show your daughter that you don't accept bigotry in any form. I would also suggest you and your husband attend therapy to discuss this issue further. Bigotry and racism are rarely confined to just one area of life."
That's what I mean. Maybe it's something a counselor could help her with. I don't think it's fair to ask her BF to give up that lifestyle but maybe they just aren't compatible.

"I have done literally nothing. I have nothing to hide. If my boyfriend wanted to tag along every single time I hang out with my friends, I would be totally fine with it, because *nothing* inappropriate happens. 

We got too drunk, we both passed out on the bed. But shit happens. If I had actually cheated I would accept it and break up with him. But I didn't. Nothing at all happened. I know it looks bad, but I don't have inappropriate relationships with my friends. Who in the world sits down and says, ""Look, now that I'm in a relationship...if we ever get too drunk, don't pass out on my bed with me in it. That's no good."" 

Obviously I thought that was given. And if we weren't drunk, it never would have happened. If I had been awake when it happened, I would've given him a pillow and told him to find a comfy spot on the floor. But I wasn't."
"Well if he isn't willing to let go of the idea of a power struggle (but you are) he's responsible for at least meeting you half way.

I think this might be the approach I take. Torn between your suggestion and just ignoring it and I can't decide which one is making me sadder. Thanks for your input, it's really helpful."
"&gt;I am being evasive for a reason: I not willing to go into detail about it.

People talk about warning signs all over the thread. Well there's a fucking gigantic one. That's a HUGE red flag that OP here is not being fully honest, and is only giving one side of the story. 

People aren't going to like me saying this, but I'm gonna say it anyway. Your refusal to give enough information to talk about the situation makes me straight out no longer believe we're getting a remotely unbiased accounting, no longer believe your descriptions of the interactions are accurate, and no longer trust your claims.

I've seen manipulative people convince others that their SO was abusive, when really it was the first person just being really dishonest and deceitful about what happened. 

I know someone who does EXACTLY that kind of evasive answer when she makes similar complaints. I also know that's because her ""just wanting support for my insecurities"" means asking if she's pretty enough and does he REALLY love her for literally the 20th time that day.

At this point, if I had to make a bet, I'm more inclined to believe you're misrepresenting things to garner extra empathy than to believe your description of events."
"no, your wife is not being emotionally abusive, she's reacting in a normal way to an uneven division of labor.  the problem isn't that you're disabled, the problem isn't that you're depressed, the problem is that she's supporting 3 adults and 2 children on her salary while you &amp; your sister put the kids in daycare so you can put your efforts into volunteering elsewhere.

volunteer work is a **luxury**.  it is not a necessity.  I understand that you enjoy it and it makes you happy, but you can't just put your own satisfaction ahead of your wife's needs.  it doesn't sound like you appreciate her at all.  she's paying your sister a hefty salary so you two can leave the kids with other people and go volunteer?  

I've struggled with depression so I know you need a positive outlet in your life, but you can't pursue it at your wife's expense.  it's not fair to her at all.  you need to stop paying your sister, stop putting your kids in daycare, stop volunteering and pull your own weight around the house.  once your wife's financial burden is reduced and she can work a bit less, then she can start seeing you as an equal.  right now, you're looking to be treated like a child and you're wondering why she's not treating you as an adult."
I'm still a heavy Tumblr user and I can guarantee you that this culture of 'fund me!!' continues.
"Wtf, what is it about your family that your girlfriend hates them so much?

She seems to be throwing a tantrum because she's not getting what she wants. Unless your family are just the most awful, mean people I don't really see what she has against them.

Have you met her family yet?"
"You can take comfort that if you do muster the self-esteem to actually leave, she will find another sucker tout de suite to pretend to fall in love with and move in as her sugar daddy. The kids will probably get attached to him, too, and the next clueless guy after that, and so on. 

In any case, she and the absentee dad will be the ones screwing up the kids' lives, not you. "
No. I would not give that example at a wedding to show how much you love your brother. Come up with something else.
I'm dying to see what it looked like! 
"She sounds like me. I'm 5'9, was 150-160 lbs all throughout college, then gained 45 pounds after graduation. I tried time after time after time to lose it, and threw out every excuse in the book: I'll start on Monday, I'm waiting until the 1st of the month, I just want to finish this pizza then I'll start...blah blah blah. I complained and cried and threw out my favorite clothes, and my boyfriend tried to encourage me, but nothing worked. 

With weight loss, the motivation has to come from within. There are lots of things you can try. You can cook healthy food for her, you can encourage her to do physical activities with you, you can help her find a sport she loves, you can help her research diet and exercise programs. My boyfriend bought me p90x and tried to get me to do it with him. I think I did 3 sessions before quitting. I ate his healthy dinners...after stopping at Chick Fil A for a secret pick me up. I skipped the activities he suggested and made excuses to avoid the gym. 

I know this sounds really negative, but she has to find it within herself to get past the ""I hate being fat!"" stage and move into the ""I'm ready to do something about this"" stage. Until she does, she won't lose weight. For me, my tipping point was getting a new driver's license. Holding my old one next to my new one let me see just how fat my face had gotten. Since then, I've been on the weight loss path--30 pounds down since 4/20. /r/loseit has been an invaluable resource to me. 

She has to find her tipping point. I'm sorry, but short of being supportive, there's just not a whole lot you can do here. Much like quitting smoking, starting a healthy lifestyle requires a hell of a lot of internal discipline and motivation."
"Get yourself to therapy. Do NOT get sucked into discussing it with her. You are going. End of conversation. Don't respond to any attempt on her part to continue it. Change the subject. If she won't change the subject, exit the conversation.

Mental health is as important as any other kind. Her trying to stop you from doing this is just as shitty and unethical as keeping you from receiving critical medical care for an injury or illness. 

Your girlfriend is abusive and controlling. Maybe therapy will help you see this. 

&gt;I refuse to leave her.

When you make the relationship more important than ANYTHING else, including your own psychological health, you are setting yourself up to be abused, manipulated, and taken advantage of. "

"Don't complain, just tell your boss you were having a stressful day (which isn't a lie). If you can find a position in a different department, do so. Don't complain about the director or talk about the things he said to anyone at work. Word will get around. You will look like a problem that other directors and managers won't want to deal with. If you can't find a position in another department, consider finding a position with another company. 

All of this might seem drastic, but that director has made it clear that he doesn't value your work and that he wouldn't think twice about ruining your career. Why? Who knows? You need to protect yourself"
"I honestly think it would have been more suspicious if she was still fancy at that hour. For me and most of my girl friends, we take that shit off as soon as we're home *unless* we're keeping it on for a guy. Fancy shit looks fabulous but it is usually uncomfortable!

This guy is unreal"
"Wow, he's incredibly selfish.  He basically asked for threesomes with women, but anything you might want (like a threesome with another man) is not allowed? Hypocrisy at it's finest.  

That feeling you have?  The deadness when he says he loves you, the random crying, etc...OP, that's your gut telling you loud and clear that now that he's revealed this side of himself, you no longer love or respect him in the same way.  And I don't advise you to ignore that and try to push through.  If you really really want to try, pause the wedding and get into couples counselling to try to work through this. I think you'll end up staying and being pressured into a threesome you don't really want and feeling horrible afterwards, or you will leave him.  I think leaving him is the right decision here.

"
"By all standard social metrics in every culture I can think of, your parents are right.  That said you can be whoever you want...but without those social rituals being followed you can't expect them to have a different view of you.  "
What do you mean by your daughter refusing to talk until she was four? Did she not talk at all? 
"Yes yes yes. This is absolutely a blessing in disguise. OP's wife can relax. I'm sure it hurts her feelings right now, but hopefully in hindsight she'll recognize how much easier her SIL made it for her.

I wonder if OP's wife is a pleaser who insists that everything is okay, but gets overwhelmed. 

SIL tried to give her excuses, but she refused them all, so she had to point blank kick her out of the party. It's unfortunate that her tactful approaches didn't work. But I wouldn't write her off as a bridezilla just yet."
"&gt; I am 18, I am an adult and I am capable of making my own decisions

I love when I hear teenagers say that. Hilarious.

You're right to be concerned, a guy who is almost 30 should not be dating a teenager. Unfortunately, she doesn't realize it yet. And she probably won't listen to you if you tell her she shouldn't date him, on principle that you're her father and the ""bad cop"".

Educate her. Tell her the factors of a good, respectful relationship. If a guy is selfish, abusive, or pressures her into anything, he's not a good partner.

She'll likely be making a lot of her own mistakes. All you can do is give her all the information you can."
He's broke?! I thought for sure money was involved. Why is she dropping out of school -- structural engineers is a career that's pays well -- to marry a broke senior citizen? Is she moving in with his son and DIL too?
"If your going to talk to the siblings about it I'd make it as up front as possible to stop the ""tattling"" complaints. Just a group chat between everyone asking ""I wanted to talk to everyone regarding the present before I give you $6k"" your siblings will pick up on the unfairness. "
"Yeah, I would just tell him. I would start with, ""Hey, I was at the bar friend Stacy and Clinton. Hookup came and introduced himself.""

See if Pat says anything and if he doesn't, just be like, ""I'm gay, Pat's gay, and he has been telling people you guys hook up. I just thought you should know incase it's supposed to be a secret. No one reacted badly. I just would like to be told the same info."" "
" I remember this! Exactly the situation I thought of!   it's the same thing. She says ""life's not about money"" but if he weren't paying for everything for her she would not be with him.  OP - leave her, you deserve better."
"I don't like Ariana Grande, and part of what weirds me out is the way she seems to *know* she looks young and capitalizes on the cute sexiness. But while it's my right to not like that, it's everyone else's right to be totally into it. I don't get to tell other people they're pedophiles for reacting the way she intends them to... She's obviously attractive and is very much not a child, so there's objectively nothing wrong here. 

Your SO just sounds insecure. A frank chat needs to happen about this, and if she can't apologize for accusing you of something so heinous over someone who has been legal for even longer than you have been... I would send her packing. It's just not ok."
"Hilarious.  I can see it now, ""your honor, this dog is claiming self defense."""
"Why does an unreasonable age difference make his totally unreasonable treatment of her reasonable? Lay out your thoughts, cause I'm not following"
"It kind of sounds like your boyfriend has outgrown his friends. I don't think there's anything wrong with choosing not to do drugs, so I think your view on drugs is just fine. Being around people who are fucked up on drugs when you are sober is zero fun, so I wouldn't want to go to the party either. 

Is there a compromise? How far out in the desert is the party? Could your boyfriend and you meet up with them the first night before everyone gets blackout? That's probably what I would try to do."
Do you realise those guys would probably continue harass other women even if they speak up? Abusers don't care. Stop blaming victims.
"&gt;when he does take breaks he doesn't try to hang out with m because he says he doesn't have time, but ends up watching tv or going out with his coworkers 

Sounds like he's not really into you. That or he really is just to busy. Either way, if you aren't happy waiting or coping with his hectic work schedule, dumping him isn't a bad idea at all."
"This needs more acknowledgement. She is constantly accusing him of cheating yet she lives with her ex boyfriend, this is most likely projection. It's very odd if the two of you have been careful that she has miraculously fell pregnant again, especially with her Ex still in the picture.

OP I would make sure you are certain that this child is yours. Paternity test most definitely. 

You do not need to stay with this woman if you are unhappy in the relationship but if the child is yours you have a lot to plan and prepare for."
"This is totally true. Ask them if they really want to alienate the person who will be responsible for their healthcare, living situation, and general well-being in a few decades."

Update! My dad told me to tell him since he originally bought me the laptop that it's his.  So I came to his house once find my iPhone notified me the laptop was on (literally it's still registered under me) and told him he has 5 minutes to bring it out.  He brought it to me and I paid him for the repairs which amounted to exactly $321.95.  I even sent him a screenshot of the repair bill which was sent to my email originally.  He proceeded to text me to go off and be a whore :) blocked and done with! I'm ready to go on with my life now! 
"The house is not only costing you money, but also makes you liable for a lot of things... I'm guessing her family wouldn't have any issues taking you to court if they feel you don't maintain the property or if someone gets injured.

If she doesn't want to keep the house, then she can donate it or sell it and then donate whatever money you get. At this point, she's enabling her relatives and harming your future."

Oh, really?

""Ok Jack, I am asking if I can drive your car!""

See where that takes you.
"
"I agree that it's possible that he doesn't trust OP as a driver or that he doesn't think that she's got enough experience with this type of car to drive it without a high risk of accident. But how does he know so much about his female coworkers' driving skills that he feels comfortable letting her drive it? OP has said that she was fine with him not letting her drive it. She's just upset that he let someone who really isn't into cars and who's an attractive woman drive it. Also, if there was good explanation, he should've given it rather than just saying, ""I let her drive it because she asked."" Yes, it's his car, and he can decide who does and doesn't drive it, but that's a non-explanation that's bound to cause confusion and hurt feelings."
"&gt; Yeah, I'd take a bullet for the guy, 

Would you take an STD for him? That's what his wife might be doing."
"**You are NOT whining.** If your sister, mother, or anyone else tries to tell you otherwise don't you dare listen to them. You're 15, you shouldn't be acting at the parent of a new baby, especially not when it's your idiot sister's child (and two babies by 17? Has she never heard of birth control??). You think you're not getting enough sleep now, wait until school starts up again. You won't be getting any sleep at all. It's one thing to be asked to help out with a new baby but what your mother and sister have done is all but having given you this little girl and washed their hands of it. Sister is taking zero responsibility for her actions, and your mother is allowing that which is unacceptable. Even if she works all day and night, she's the grandmother and your parent and should NEVER be allowing all of this to fall to you. She and your sister allowed this kid to be there, you had no choice in the matter. Your mom and sister need to hike up their big girl pants and stop acting like none of their choices matter.

Your sister needs a serious reality check and some tough love instead of the wish washy no consequences bullshit she's getting now. Your mother does too if she's insane enough to actually roll with another pregnancy from your sister. Abso-fucking-lutely call CPS to at least have something on file about the conditions you (as you are indeed still considered a child by the state) and the baby are in. I would even go as far as to call or go the police station and report this all as child abuse (may go further or faster with the cops than with CPS). Your sister is an unfit mother and your mother is an unfit grandmother. The baby should not be in the household if you are its only caregiver.

Also, I don't know what the laws or regulations are in your state, but some places allow older babies to be adopted out and most children to be turned over to the state. It may be worth researching as an option for your mother and sister to explore regarding this kid, and adoption or abortion should be seriously considered options for the unborn one too. "

"Him throwing out the furniture and backtracking on this mutual decision to take in Chad is troubling.  Even more troubling is his disappearing act.  Who is being responsible for your other children right now? I understand they can probably mostly fend for themselves, but this is not ok.  You're out of town, he's in the wind, what if something happens??

You need to get yourself a lawyer.  Your husband's behavior is erratic and you need to protect you and your children.  Maybe he's cracking under stress, but you obviously cannot trust his actions right now.

Tell your boss you need to go home NOW.  Start protecting the family money, NOW.  Find someone who can check in on your daughters ASAP.  This is all very troubling."

This whole thread makes me very thankful that when we decided to move in together that we determined the best course of action was to pick out our own place rather than moving him into my home or me into his.

"Am I the only one who thinks it *was* resolved? She likes the ring, she told him she doesn't want to wear the pendant, he's slightly disappointed but he understands.

"I think he has moved on and is happy and you should just let it go. Personally if I were him I wouldn't even want to be reminded of that situation. Also I know a girl I went to school with spread a nasty rumor about me (never found out what it was, but she said ""Sorry I spread that rumor about you!"") and I connected the dots that that was why everyone I had been close to at school suddenly ghosted me. Frankly I still think about it occasionally and get upset because I really felt close to those people, but I'm upset mostly at them for believing her and doing that to me. If they came to apologize to me now I'd wonder why they bothered since they literally NEVER came to me to ask me for my side of the story or to try to get ANY clarification about whateverthefuck the rumor was. 

I have a feeling this guy would feel exactly the same way, if not even worse since he KNEW what the rumor was and tried to address the fact that it wasn't true and nobody believed him.

"
I'm a woman around her age and I don't get why you haven't dumped her. Clearly you don't have enough self respect.
you're never going to wake up one day and want kids and thats totally okay! i do not think you should have children just for your fiancé and you REALLY REALLY need to sit down and convey this to him. 
At that point she may as well dissolve the partner ship if she doesn't trust him this much 
"&gt;she literally wants you to CHEAT on your wife and have sex with her to get her pregnant

Not only that, but if her ultimate goal is to get pregnant then they're probably going to have to do the deed more than once. That's why people usually go to doctors for this kind of stuff because they can make sure the egg(s) are fertilized the *first* time. "
"I would love to do those things with him. I tend grow restless so I like taking walks. But he only wants to walk to get food and then he considers it not quality time together.

Sometimes what I offer to do also gets rejected. We both play Pokemon Go so I offer to go to s different city to play and have a picnic on the beach but he just says 'no that sounds boring as fuck'.

"First of all, do you really believe they spent four nights together in a hotel room and only got to first base? 16-year-old Mormons move faster than that.

Relationships do sometimes recover from cheating, but the fact that he's almost certainly still not being honest with you is a bad sign. That tells me that he hasn't turned over any kind of new leaf."
"How the hell is op ""not acting her age"" or ""slutting around the school""? Or are you one of those people who thinks merely existing as a woman with big tits is slutty?"
They will; I'll request this.
You still need to make sure the wife knows so she can get tested. You'll still have to talk to her about this.
"I think you might have to accept that the type of man who would date an 18 year old when he's nearly 30 might have some arrested development issues.

"&gt; your mother has legal rights to prevent contact with people she doesn't want you to be in contact with

I don't know if that's true. I mean you're less than a year from being a legal adult so I don't think any lawyer/police officer/judge that got involved would take it seriously &amp; he's not harassing you so I don't think she can get a restraining order. But you might want to ask r/legaladvice"

"Man you're too young for these games if she has to keep a secret like that, then what's the point? You're still young yet, and it may seem like she's your soul mate, and you probably love her a lot but the reality of it is you still have a long life of dating ahead of you and if she won't value your relationship in front of people she cares about, that tells you a lot about how she feels about you

In the end it's your call, I know nothing about you but looking from the outside in, issues like this only tend to get bigger. Think about this, the people she's friends with now will likely be her friends for a very long time, if so, how long does she plan on keeping this a secret? Eventually the facade will break, and whatever happens from there is unpredictable. Talk to her about it, tell her how you feel and then make your decision.

And to answer your last question, no. Asking her to acknowledge you at school is not too much to ask at all

Edit: grammar"
"All virgins, even if they seem calm, have some form of performance anxiety. If you decide you want to have sex with him, show him how to get you off (it will be a huge boost to his confidence if he sees you are enjoying yourself).

She is allowed to have friends. You both live with this one. I mean...I don't see the cause for concern. What is the difference between hanging out at home with your roommate, or catching Pokemon outside with your roommate? 

&gt;but I feel like I'm sharing my gf with my roommate and I don't like that feeling.

"I'm not going to comment on how much of a stupendously questionable decision it is to move countries to be with someone you've only known two months (ok aside from this) and answer your question of how to deal with your mother 🙃

It sounds like she is not going to approve of your decision. I get wanting to share a big life change with your parents but honestly it sounds like it will make things worse. It almost feels like when people in breakups wanna have closure because t will make them feel better when in reality we don't live in a mid 2000s romcom and closure only comes from within. 

She doesn't sound like she's suddenly going to come around so my advice would be to keep her on an information diet. Stand firm in your decision to move but don't over share. Let your relationship speak for itself over time and hopefully she will come around."

"&gt; I wouldn't call him a selfish person

He is probably just insecure. Getting a smaller size condom would mean admitting he is smaller than he wishes he was. It's stupid, but that's what insecurity is about."
"Frankly, the fact you had to ""lobby her hard"" at all should've been reason enough to back off.  Yes, both of you ultimately had to agree to this...but I can't help imagining some part of her was afraid that if she didn't say yes, you'd decide to fill out the rest of your family elsewhere and she'd be stuck raising the rest of the brood on her own.  

It also doesn't help that your argument was flawed from the start.  #4 isn't going to get the sibling experience your older kids did because twins tend to have a different dynamic.  But even if you'd just wound up with one baby, there's no guarantee they would've bonded.  And you and your wife aren't the same parents or people you were when #1 came along.  If you'd presented being the youngest as a good and normal thing, #4 would've followed your lead.  Instead, s/he now gets a mom who's completely overwhelmed and a dad who's trying to brush that off as ""anxiety"" because he's gotten everything he wanted and more.

Maybe your wife will fall in love once the twins are here.  Maybe this is hormone-related depression, and can be treated.  But I don't think you can count on that.  What you need to do is acknowledge she has reason to be feeling the way she feels, step up and figure out how to give her more than night and weekend breaks from childcare, and keep an eye on whether counseling might be needed to manage any lingering resentment."
"&gt;Can I buy a diamond alternative and pass it off as a diamond?

Sure, if you are fine with lying to her face and never getting a 2 carat ring insured (Insure the damn thing if you end up getting this thing). 

If she wants a diamond, I doubt you are going to change her mind. 

There are lab diamonds and they are high quality stones, but I believe that they are less expensive. 

Does she realize how large a 2 carat stone is? Has she done any research into the cost of that? Your budget? 

Has she ever seen a Moissanite ring? 

Edit: 

I just saw where you said that this ring will be less than one month's salary. It's not like she is asking for something that is actually going to damage....anything. So what is the problem?"
Can you maybe have a rule that for 1 hour a night you both do housework stuff? No video games between 6 and 7 or whatever and as long as he is doing something useful leave it at that.  If he does it wrong he just has to fix it.
"OP, you really need to listen to this. In this situation, co-sleeping could very well be considered neglect. A peed-in bed is not hygienic and the toddler in the bed is super unsafe for the baby. I have three babies that I co-slept with for years. This is a very bad decision. Toddler needs her own bed, and pull-ups got night time. You have minimal chance of getting through the exhaustion of a newborn if you don't fix this particular problem. 

Also, your husband is a selfish asshole, but he has a few points. "
"These are some good, concrete suggestions. If the husband is being rude directly to Kenton (I got the impression that it was mostly him being snide when Kenton wasn't around), OP needs to bend over backwards to deal with that. Get up and say, ""You know what, why don't I drive you two to the movies? Here's $20 for tickets"" when the husband starts showing his ass. She absolutely should not sit and watch this go down. 

And really, same thing when he does it just to their daughter: ""Husband, I don't appreciate you disrupting dinner to be rude to our daughter. She and I are going to go to the mall. Bye."" She can't change his opinions for him, but she can remove herself and everybody else from the situation whenever he expresses them. That makes it clear that his opinions aren't acceptable to everybody involved."
It seems like an odd statement too since he's not trying to meet their mother and steal attention away from OP or something.
Seriously. Some states are moving towards making them illegal. They have detrimental effects.
"Yup, control totally jumped out at me reading the OP. My GF and I will move in together sometime soon - and I totally expect it to be a stressful process to some extent, but we'll be ditching things on *both* sides. Just comes from both people having a lot of crap."
"I know. But she is. She grew up in the tropics where every day is 80+, even on Christmas. I've seen her put on a sweater when I'm debating dipping my feet in the water to cool off. So when we go visit my family in San Francisco, I know we're going to get off the place and she'll immediately say she wished she brought a jacket, and then spend the rest of the trip shivering and not wanting to go down to the water because it's too cold. But she never actually *packs* a jacket because ""My weather app says it's going to get up to 70, I'll be fine and just deal with the rest of it."" Yeah...70 for about an hour a day. And with windchill. And I know she's going to be cold. But it's still not enough to convince her that maybe she should take the extra half-inch of space to pack a light windbreaker. "
"The more I read the more I think you have to leave. This should've ended when he got aggressive while you were pregnant, or after the cheating, or after the lying. But better late than never.

There is an old saying. ""The best time to plant a cherry tree is twenty years ago. The second best time is right now."" Would you tell an overweight 30 year old who wants to get in shape ""too late tubs""? No, you'd encourage them to exercise and diet now. Same with you. You're miserable. You resent him. This relationship is toxic. So go."
"Just because she said that doesn't mean it's true, ya know... 

Maybe she'll have a different opinion when you tell her quitting your job is not an option. "

"She's not embarrassing herself. You feel embarrassed because you're overly  concerned about what other people *might *be thinking about her and, by extension, you. You need to deal with your weak self confidence and stop using your gf like an accessory. If she's not wearing this dress to a funeral or a black tie event run by your employer, you need to get over yourself. It sounds like she has a healthy sense of self. Maybe you could get some tips. "
"The idiot deserves prison. This wasn't something that snuck up on him, he was warned and did it anyways; it's his own damn fault."
"You live in NYC and didn't see who it was first?  You just opened the door to whoever happened to knock?  While you've got an ounce of weed sitting out in plain sight?

Hell, you're lucky it was just your sister.  I know in NJ, the smell of weed alone is enough to give cops probable cause to search your apartment.  If you had opened the door to them (because, you know, you didn't bother to see who it was while you were engaging in illegal activity), you'd have a lot bigger problems then having to find a better or second job and toning down your lifestyle a bit."
"You don't have to dump her, OP, but you sure as heck don't have to marry her if she sees your proposal as a photo op for her facebook page.  You and she need a lot more discussion about your core values as well as your goals and objectives for the future.  Communication is going to be crucial because you and this lady do not know each other well enough to get married."
"Maybe it came out wrong but the point of our conversation was that instead of going for the most expensive option or the most budget friendly option for me we will go for the ""most fun option"" aka the middle road. If the best option if the most expensive option and she can do it for me, I will be more than willing to accept. "
"Because it is. Saying ""but there might be men watching!"" or ""oh, she might be doxxed"" is infantilizing and concern trolling masquerading as legitimate concern. And asking *her* to change *her* life to accommodate *him* under the guise of ""safety"" is not only unrealistic, it's controlling, and yes, it is jealousy. 

With that logic, you can justify not letting her drive because there are drunk drivers, and women aren't great drivers. You can justify making her dress a certain way because men might stare at her. You can justify not letting her leave the house alone because she might be abducted and raped. Pretending that you know better than she does on her own safety, life, and hobbies is condescending and flat out disgusting. 

Grow up. "
"&gt;But infidelity doesn't happen in a vacuum.



I've never heard such a sickeningly apologist statement before. "
"This is terrible advice. 

She's the best friends little sister.

She's already proven her ability to work well within what the firm needs

She's been there more than ten years

She only said the kid has wonderful parents - how does that translate into ""you wanna fuck ny husband???"""
"This happened with my ex husband. It started with comments like ""I wish you wouldn't wear things like that, I don't want men looking at you."" Right before our separation, it was so bad that he would scream at me, accusing me of trying to fuck people when I dressed up (I was a music ed major and had to dress nicely for teaching and performances. It was required!) He was also cheating on me, and was controlling as well. It was an abusive relationship for far too long.

You said in your post that you started to apologize at one point, but stopped because you felt you shouldn't have to. Listen to that feeling. Trust your gut and stay strong."
"I'm not sure how she plans to handle the situation going forward, but she has my full support with whatever she decides, whether that be move forward and look past this or reconsider attending the wedding. "
"OP is male, so I very much doubt that marrying his closest male cousin will do much to improve his standing."
"This website is absolutely packed to the brim with men who say they won't get married because they don't want any woman to end up with their possessions or messing with their things...but of course you have a billion people here saying YOU, a woman, must share. If your fiance is a shitty driver, don't let him drive the car, until maybe one day when he isn't so shitty. Too bad if he thinks the car is too 'masculine' for you."
"You don't take it back. You just don't mention it again. If asked, you say ""I do not want to discuss religion."" 

She is probably right about not telling your grandma."
"But what if they did go backpacking through Europe while doing charity work for orphans? I know that's a very farfetched, unlikely thing that happened, but if it is true, I'd want to hear it. Is one-upping blatantly lieing? Is it sharing too much of a true experience? No disrespect, I'm just trying to understand. It just seems to me that some people don't like it when others share their experiences, and as a result feel insecure for not doing what or as much as the other person did."
"Hell no, 30 is awesome. It was like a switch flipped, and I realized I don't have to care what other people think of me. I spent my 20s anxiously trying to make other people accept and approve of my life; what a waste of energy! Live and let live - you do you, and I'll do me. In your 30s, you know who you are in a way you can't in your 20s. You do have to accept that there are some things that you won't accomplish in this life (like I'm definitely not going to medical school, for example), but that's fine. Seriously, no reason to dread being 30. 

Edited to add: OPs girlfriend sounds insufferably crass. Bragging about her style, sense of fashion, insight, and education? And dont forget her effortless swagger on the dance floor, ugh. People who actually have those things don't brag about them. If she was a friend of mine, I'd tell her that she's being tacky. But at 30+ I don't have time to be ""friends"" with people that obnoxious. "
"He needs to put up or shut up.  He agreed to help this traumatized kid and then backed out and is effectively abusing the kid now.

Can you tolerate such behavior from your partner?

He absolutely owes you an explanation at the very least.  You may need to report to child welfare or whomever helped set up this placement that your home is not as welcoming as you anticipated, simply for the boy's well-being."
"Ugh, I can't even imagine. There is a really cute picture of my niece and I from the wedding and my ex is peeking out from behind her head and it made me mad that he did it in the first place because he ruined a good picture by being weird, and now I'm even more upset because it's a picture I would frame if it weren't for him. 

It's impossible for me to photoshop him out because I'm not good with photoshop.

I can see a little bit of OPs side because maybe he feels like this is a long term thing, but I can also see OPs girlfriends side because I would have been so mad and I know my sister in law would have, too. 

OP, you should have a sit down conversation about your feelings on this being long term for you, if you haven't already. Maybe she doesn't think you're serious. "
"I didn't think about her being able to read comments and see it, so it would be better at this point to just write it out. "
[deleted]
The cookie jar is just a black hole at the bottom.
That might be okay if OP's girlfriend had not explicitly told him she's uncomfortable with it. What you are suggesting is a calculated lie.
"Our family introduced two kittens to our fat red cat.  We were worried that he might be territorial/aggressive (he prefers the outside, and is used to fighting strange cats), but he was really scared! Big cat, shaking over some kittens. 

It took weeks for them to want to be in the same room. Now he's over it, but he's an asshole to the male 'kitten', no problems with his sister."
"&gt;She was so attracted that she expressed her infatuation with him to her friends behind my back, telling her friend that he is extremely attractive, she can’t stop staring at him when he is in the room, she can’t stop thinking about him and she can’t help herself, and that she may be growing feelings with him and wanted to ‘bang’ him.

That's a hell of a lot of ""joking"". I'd say it's pretty damn suspect that she's saying this without you around to hear the ""joke"". Let me ask you: if you were ""joking"" like this about another girl to your friends and your gf picked up on it, would she be upset? 

If she is truly joking, it's a pretty shitty joke and she's not really valuing your feelings and making herself look like a trashy cheater. Otherwise, she's conditioning you to the idea of her cheating on you, so when the time comes around and she ""drunkenly"" kisses/fucks this guy, she can say, ""well I told you that I would XXX ..."". 

Honestly man, it's your life, and your time and energy. I can only tell you what I would do, which wouldn't include staying with someone who doesn't value my time as much as I do."
"Not to be an ass, but how did you manage to think that responding to calls and texts she initiated would make you seem clingy? "
Yea there's no way they just go their own separate ways after a few months of carrying on like this. 
"I was with a terrible ex for 7 years, got married and lasted about a year before I got divorced. I should have walked away before the marriage, but at least I walked away before I had kids. 

It doesn't sound like you're compatible. You're being his mommy when you're 7 years younger. There's a reason why people say that age gap relationships are problematic when the younger person is a teenager or early 20s. You grow up and mature, and the older person stays the same. In fact their immaturity is why they dated younger, and you just didn't realize it due to less experience.

I think you should look for a divorce lawyer and get out before you get further entangled. When it's a short marriage, the divorce is easier due to less financial mingling. Good luck and take care."
"I mean, you could understand. Think of one of your oldest and best friends, one who you aren't attracted to at all. He comes to you and goes ""SharpShot94z, I'm dying. I've never had sex with a guy before but I've always wanted to, and I've had a crush on you based on our friendship and my fetishization of your race, so can I fuck you?""

You're saying your reply would be ""... Well, as long as it's just once and you never tell anyone, that seems reasonable. Hop on!"""
"I was full of sympathy for the guy and then I got to the ""tiny asian"" part and I literally made a face of disgust. I hope he remains a virgin."
"&gt; Is it normal to throw a fit 

No.

&gt; Is not texting goodnight unforgiveable

No.


She is not mentally healthy.  She is actually not really even close.  Her anxiety is crippling, and she has severe control issues.  You should get out of this relationship for yourself, but if that's not enough reason, do it for her.  She does not need a relationship, she does not need to be enabled, she needs to hit rock bottom and get some real help.  Nothing you have described in this entire passage is healthy at all, let alone ""normal"""
"Wow lol.  I'm speechless.  Your bf is a piece of work.  This is how I interpreted it:  He wants you to feel comfortable not to question his hanging one on one with his ex, yet he doesn't want you to befriend her, because that will make it harder for her to betray you if he convinces her to cheat with him.  Or, his plan was to reconnect with her and when she rejected him, there was no reason to stay friends anymore and now he's embarrassed and doesn't want you to stay friends with her.  Also, if she rejected him, she may want to tell you what he did behind your back and warn you what a scumbag he is.  Either way, he sounds like garbage.  Throw him away."
"You're coming off as pretty victim blame-y. Are you seriously scolding her because she did not immediately know how to react to her BOSS saying such weird shit about her looks? 

I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you're not a woman.

But this:

&gt;and to be more confident. I argue that I am, to which he drops the kicker: ""no, you're not. If you were, you'd dress like Lauren.""
He said this as a suggestion to me, but also in front of Lauren in a critical of her way.
&gt;At this point I'm laughing (I laugh when I am nervous). So confused at who this man is. He tells me I'd be really pretty if I wanted to be, and comments on my dark under eye circles: is that make up? Are you run down?

I mean, I would have answered ""are you fucking kidding me? Go fuck yourself"" but I've always been a little too blunt for business &amp; have had ten more years of this bullshit than OP."
"or maybe, at least have a conversation with him? I'd say that could be the first step."
Maybe better to just let her think that and break up..I mean you doomed the relationship from the beginning. I'm confused as to why you have been together for a year when she is not a part of your life long goals. 
"""Loose lips sink ships!"" 

Some people like being the open gay drunk. If this is at a bar it might be a mix of ""HE IS MINE YOU SEXY MAN YOU!"" and ""STUPID DRUNK."" "
"The smell of gasoline, a clean windshield, and a shoeshine!"
If he's also 17 then there's probably nothing to get child support from.
"Yeah I figured this would come up. Well LUCKILY I'm not pregnant (ha, ha) but I suppose probably overwhelmed and feeling quite alone after leaving all my friends and family. 


I spoke with him a little about how he feels that he doesn't really give anything to the relationship and he explained that because he makes 30k more (I'm on 60k &amp; he's on 90k) and I get home earlier during the week (I work 6:30a-4:30p, he works 7:30a-6p) I have time to do these things &amp; he contributes financially. I explained that I also study 20 hours a week but he doesn't take that into account. He isn't really concerned about not contributing and said if we had kids etc. and I needed more help he would help and got quite defensive. 


He asked what I DID like about the relationship and I was able to name off a few things, but when I asked him he passive aggressively said ""well I WAS happy that you were supporting me during a stressful work time but I guess it's all done with resentment"" so I just dropped the conversation there, I don't know how to explain so that he will hear me."
dont say anything about your work schedule or give a reason.
Oh come one. I'd bet good money that she called specifically because she knew OPs girlfriends style. Asking OP what she was wearing was just a nice segue to asking what her GF was going to wear.
"I internalize a lot of my emotions and then talk about them when I'm ready and have thought them through on my own.

I'd be pissed if my pet died and someone continually tried to make me confront and talk about it."
"Ouch...dude, no.

Were you hoping she would throw herself on your cock when you dropped in at 1 AM if you ignored her for 10 days while texting her employee and posting pics with bars girls on FB?   

Here' s a clue...she tried to chase you. She tried to call and text, but you willfully ignored that. So she began moving on to someone who did pay attention to her. You've been together for over two years...she shouldn't have to beg for your attention and you should stop playing juvenile 'power' games. Girls who go for that shit have no self respect."
"&gt; The groom got on the phone and said not to tell the bride. Im like I only care about my boyfriend so whatever.

Ehhh. They asked you to lie to the bride, and you were perfectly willing to do so. You also knew *they'd* be lying to her. You're shocked, though, that they'd lie to *you*. Liars lie, news at eleven. My sympathy is limited."
"It makes me sad that OP thinks she is vapid or entitled for not being happy with a cheap ring and a half assed engagement. No OP, that's not it at all, you just have an apathetic boyfriend."
"While I don't think you can make this decision for him, I think you should try to become more positive towards the possibility that these kids come back into your lives. It will surely open up old wounds, and it will be hard to see your husband feel that pain, but those wounds may ultimately heal much better if he can form a healthy (if perhaps still distant) relationship with his kids now. The way he's reacting (aversively/avoidantly, emotionally, knee-jerk, black-and-white thinking) tells me those wounds are stitched up so that he can function but the incisions inside haven't grown back together yet, not even as scar tissue, or the nascent new tissue has been torn back open again. Maybe finally getting to tell his side and at least getting to a mutual Christmas card sending kind of relationship would be good for him. Plus, someday your kids are going to be old enough to wonder why they don't know their half-siblings...are you going to feel good telling your kids how you two are treating their half-siblings right now? I think this is one of those times to be the bigger person and try to welcome them, if cautiously. Honestly I think you and your husband (or at least him) should consider going back to counseling to work through your feelings on the kids contacting you, because that's a big disruption in your lives. Your husband may need time to process this still.

Remember that while 21, 20, and 19-year-olds are legal adults, they have very little life experience and their brains aren't even fully developed yet (you don't gain a complete appreciation for the consequences of your actions until around 25). Do you know if they were still living with their mom at that point? Most people don't really get a sense of themselves as their own person until they move out from under their parents' roof. It also takes time to realize something isn't right and you need therapy; how long did it take your husband to admit that? And he was a fully independent adult with a great deal of life experience, approaching middle age - they were barely out of childhood, newly minted ""adults"" trying to figure out who they are at the same times as figuring out the logistics of how to make ends meet and keep their shit together. Even if all three of them moved out at 18 and got themselves into therapy immediately, it can also take more than 1-3 years to work through what your messed-up home life was like as a kid and understand what fault lies where.

At some level, there are certain things you can't see until you have some real life experience. Try to remember what it was like to be 18-21 and reflect a bit on how much you know now that you didn't know then, and think about how much more distorted your perspective would have been if you'd come from such a messed up home life as these kids. Even the most responsible and well-adjusted kids from perfectly happy home lives take some time to figure out how to distinguish between four types of beliefs/facts/values/judgments they were taught as children: (a) things they thought were true but which turn out to be false; (b) things they thought were false but it turns out are actually true; (c) things that are partially true but which are tainted by bias, omission, or partial falsehoods or which are ultimately questions of opinion which require to make their own judgment call; and (d) things that were essential but which their parent(s) either simply didn't know, couldn't articulate, omitted either accidentally or deceitfully, or considered but incorrectly rejected or which are mostly new to this generation. 

Also remember that this doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision and it doesn't have to be made all at once. Opening the channel of communication to some degree doesn't mean they have to become 100% totally close family on the spot or ever. There is a lot of middle ground here besides no contact and trying in vain to replicate the kind of relationship he's going to have with your kids together (it's never going to be fully the same because of the lost time and bad memories even if they mend things as well as they can). A conversation isn't forgiveness or even a promise of future conversations."
"Leave him, take the kids, and claim child support so you can buy pull ups. No pissy bed and no pissy husband."
"These are the most common symptoms:

* Extremely loud heavy snoring, often interrupted by pauses and gasps
* Excessive daytime sleepiness, e.g., falling asleep at work, whilst driving, during conversation or when watching TV. (This should not be confused with excessive tiredness with which we all suffer from time to time)
* Irritability, short temper
* Morning headaches
* Forgetfulness
* Changes in mood or behaviour
* Anxiety or depression
* Decreased interest in sex"
He should just hire an army of Grandmas to bake the cookies for him.
Call AAA. Get a giant pillow. 
"I think this is the most likely scenario.

If OP told him he should have some friends come by to see the clothes, omitting that some items were reserved is a bit of an oversight. Most people would assume that it's first-come-first-served. 

I do think its a bit rude for them to take everything, but they would have just assumed that it was all being junked / donated anyway.

Maybe OP's boyfriend could get back some of the things that were promised to other people, by telling his friends some of the things were in the pile erroneously."
"Sorry it sounded so bleak. It's not like it's complete unhappiness, it's that I kind of have to slowly re-learn how to human, to be a decent friend, and to be a creative professional, and to be an assertive wife.

I'm really lucky that I have friends and a boyfriend who have supported me through my bizarre womanchildhood in my 20s."
That's what I thought too. Most people don't spend 10k on an engagement ring. Especially when she picked out one that was a little more than 1/10 of that. 
"Damn dude you're a terrible person. The first time you fucked her sister was bad enough but then you went and did it again when your GF clearly stated that was off limits (you should've known she was of limits the first time though). Break it off with T, your relationship is doomed anyway. And don't hook up with M again, it will hurt T even more. I realise this must be difficult, since the 2 of you are perfect for each other, both equal levels of horrible people, but please try to not be more of a dick than you've already been."
"Just to let you know, I read recently that this exact scenario happened except the fake proposal was in front of family, and the couple had three kids together. She was so humiliated that she sued her partner and the judge awarded her an £800,000 house that the couple jointly owned. So it's unacceptable even in the eyes of the law"
"Since she's no longer a bridesmaid, does that mean she doesn't have to wear the coordinating dress all the other bridesmaids will be wearing? Maybe something to compliment (what I assume) will be her new wedding outfit?

(this is so sweet!!)"
"And I'm confused about how his ex took him for granted. Sounds like it was the other way around since he was so blindsided. It's unfortunate, and I understand the pain, but OPs attitude makes me think his girlfriend knew what was best for both of them. "
I make way less than that working!!!  I make like 1500 bring home.  Considering their college is paid they could start working.  I've noticed people who don't work through college were the ones that didn't really apply themselves in getting a job after college.
"I'm not sure she's ever seen it... when we were younger, she auditioned for the choir I was a part of a couple of times, and was unsuccessful (unsurprisingly). She asked me to help her with her technique, and I recorded her singing and played it back to her. I was really young, so I wasn't comfortable being as direct as I probably could have been, but, I mean... she heard it! She knows what it sounded like, but persisted in believing that the director of my choir just didn't like her rather than acknowledging that it just sounded... bad. Come to think of it, she sorta kinda blamed my ""jealousy"" for that, too, so maybe it had been brewing for awhile."
"Have you ever just asked her, in plain language?


""Hey, Girlfriend, I noticed you don't talk about your childhood much. How come?""


That seems like it would solve a lot of problems..."
"&gt; I will never understand this line of thinking. I only work 40-43 hours a week and sure I may not have everything in the world but holy shit some people like to BRAG about working 50+ hours a week like it is some sort of accomplishment.
&gt; 

Lucy Kellaway is a pretty great British journalist who writes a lot about modern office/work culture. She did a podcast for the BBC recently and asked the same question as you -  why on earth do people *brag* about working long hours? Why is it ingrained in our society that your self-worth is directly tied with how much you work? 

I've never considered it before, but it's true. I used to be guilty of it myself, and I almost felt quite proud that I worked 80/90 hour weeks (as well as feeling depressed/exhausted). It's ridiculous. This isn't something we should be celebrating...I think sometimes you can get addicted to it and it's quite dangerous."
"How do you know exactly when his divorce was finalized? Maybe he was hiding you for a reason.

This is a personal opinion, but I think that ""shrill"" is an awful adjective that I really think women should stop using against eachother.

Her husband was with a woman 15 years younger than him within months. I totally get her frustration. I think you can't do much other than try to rise above her comments and not be the person she is claiming you are.

If I were you, I would absolutely make sure that he didn't in fact cheat before the relationship ended."
"You're not trying to be selfish? You can't be serious. You have made this woman look like a FOOL twice now, and you feel up to making it a third time. You are only thinking of yourself and what you want, not what she wants. Now that you are older and have realized that she is the one, you want to take it all back. You ruined her life! Get that through your thick skull! She had to cancel a wedding, face her friends and family, and carry on. Then she gives you another chance, but you have a girlfriend! For a year and a half you string both along. You are a selfish, immature sack of shit. Leave that woman alone. She has blocked you on everything; take the hint and do not stalk her. You've put her through enough. "
"You can feel hurt for not being picked, but you both need to get off your sister's back about who she picked and quit demanding explanations. There probably wouldn't be any drama if you and your sister hadn't started any. 

&gt; ""blood is thicker than water"" 

This doesn't mean what your sister thinks it means. "
"There are a lot of racists in the world, but, at least in the US, they are far from a majority."
"&gt;  I don't believe I have reason enough to go to the police

Yes you do.  Call them up and ask who you can send that message to.

Don't reply to the message.

I am wondering who sent it to you.  Is it something your ex would do to try to get you to contact him?  I'm having a hard time thinking of a reason a third party would send this to you, who hasn't talked to him in two years, instead of the police.
"
Well I don't want to cheat on my current gf.  If you mean the schizophrenia I don't talk to aliens through my car radio anymore.
"The only thing i can think of is that if your mattress is ON the floor it can cause some issues. Ideally you should have a little bit of ventilation going on underneath the mattress even if it is just resting on some shipping palettes or something. If you live in a super dry climate this might not be an issue but if you have humidity (or if your floors are carpeted as opposed to tiled or hardwood) then things might get a little icky underneath.  

Edit: Also, i think this arrangement sounds super cozy like other commenters said. You can control the light 100%, don't have to worry about blackout curtains and have extra living space to boot. My above advice would apply to a mattress anywhere in the apartment and is primarily a sanitary issue."
"&gt;Aside from the infidelity and lack of regard for my feelings, he is wonderful to me. He just doesn't believe in feelings and emotions, as they are irrational and simply do not compute.

Please read this to yourself over and over again until you realize how horrible this is. If someone you loved, a friend or a sibling, said this about their partner would you not be horrified?"
I want to feel insulted by this but it's just so damn true I can't even deny it. 
"&gt; And teachers actually calling parents to complain about a student reading too much? Wtf? 

Well, when the homework is not done because of reading, when reading happens instead of following the lessons or lessons are skipped in favor of reading... yeah, I would call the parents, too. (FYI this was the case with one of my nieces.)"
"It's bad... but i'm looking at alimony payments of $1500 a month for 4 years if we divorce in my state according to the calculator. We have 2 years of Daycare expenses left before she hits kindergarten, and by then I'll have the credit card debt paid off. That's a savings of OVER $1500 a month. Then, I factor in that I would only have to pay for myself and my daughter. PLUS, I'll probably be making more money then from annual raises.

It's sad that I've thought this far ahead... but I did."
"&gt; Unfortunately, that means I immediately fall in love with any relatively attractive girl that shows even the tiniest bit of interest in me. 

You need to recognize the difference between love and infatuation.  

What you feel for these girls is infatuation, and as your past experience has shown you again and again, it is fleeting.

The grass is always greenest where you water it.  Take this feeling of butterflies and think what you can do to feel like that about your girlfriend who you love and who loves you.  Then do that.

Or whenever you feel the butterflies, just swap out this other woman in your mind and imagine instead that your girlfriend is causing them.  Gradually it will be like Pavlov's dogs.  You'll see a beautiful women paying attention to you and it will give you butterflies for your girlfriend."
"This. I definitely would never classify myself as ""Insta-famous"" but about a year ago I started using my personal Instagram account as publicity for a hobby of mine, and I've built up a small following. Any time I post ""personal"" pictures (with friends, cat, etc), I lose a few followers. It sucks, because it starts to feel like you're limited on your own account - but if people follow you for a specific thing, they're not going to stick around for posts that aren't that thing. "
"This really made me laugh, thanks for that. Are you sure this wouldn't work? something tells me this kind of humour could really take the tension out of everything. Or maybe I'm just a muppet. She will be home in ten minutes and I'm just not sure which approach to take here.. "
"Maybe because your comment is confusing?

First of all, your response doesn't have anything to do with the top comment, just seems to piggy back off of it.

Secondly, it looks like you are saying that your experience with your BILs parents was terrible, yet you end by saying you wish the kids still had a relationship with them regardless of the ideals they were pushing on them. 

I don't care either way, but you asked and that's my take."
"Did you date my SO before me?

Jesus this is exactly what my relationship has been for the last 5 years. And I was at the tipping point of leaving mere months ago.

Thankfully ( a year and a half after getting that referral) I finally convinced him to get into therapy. Now he has a therapist he speaks with once a week, a psychiatrist he sees once a month who diagnosed him with anxiety and ADHD, and we see a couple's (sex) therapist together once a week. 
We've been in therapy since the early spring and things are just now starting to get better. But! They are actually getting better.

So yeah, I guess my two cents for OP would be that *if* he isn't ready to leave, he should see a couple's therapist together. Our guy really helped my SO see how much his behavior was impacting me, he didn't grasp just how bad it really was for me, and once he understood things started change very quickly for us.

That said, I would never go through this again. If my SO and I do break up and I'm in a new relationship they either already know how to be a responsible adult or I'm out so fast. This situation drained be for so many years and mentally I couldn't do it again."
You went full Twilight. NEVER go full Twilight.
"What your mom is doing is called ""parentification"". It is never the job of the child to protect parents. It is always her job as a mother to protect you guys. 

Your mom is expecting your brother to act as her father and that is wrong. It might stem from an issue she had with her father in childhood, but only she knows the real cause (if not consciously, then unconsciously). Maybe it has something to do with her ex-husband/your father. 

I'm really sorry this is happening. Do ask your teacher at school if there are resources that can go in-between, just say your mom is being mean to you guys and you want an adult that can speak to her. It's very hard to be taken seriously by parents as a kid, especially as a teenager. 

"
"So, read through all these things again and ask yourself why. 

""We just left it at that."" Why? Actually be honest.

""I didn't say anything."" Why? You should.

It sounds like he's doing this because he is not trustworthy and no one else in his sphere is either... Or he's drawing a narrative for them that paints you badly So he can get away with it. Stop dating losers like this."
"Let me tell you something:

I was in a relationship once with a guy who cheated on me and harassed me for months after our relationship ended. He alternated between begging for and **demanding** my forgiveness. He was full of excuses for what he did. There was no genuine apology anywhere.

Your ex is no longer your problem. In fact, every time you meet her, it sets you back. Why? Because you still have feelings for her. That's understandable, but that means you need more time to process this betrayal so you can move on.

If she feels guilty or unhappy, **GOOD.** She fucked up. Don't make this easy for her. It's not your job to assuage a cheater's feelings. It debases you. Let her go to a therapist and sort out her asshole tendencies there. How much longer would she have carried on with Rex if you hadn't found out? She felt so sure of her ruse that she was publicly hanging out with him and their affair was so obvious that other people noticed.

You don't owe her a last word. You don't owe it to her to help her through the pain of cheating on you. (You realize how ridiculous that sounds, right?)

Personally, I wouldn't read the letter because it will just be full of excuses and that would drive me crazy. A mature adult would not have cornered you on a plane to force you to pay attention to her. This isn't about making amends with you, it's about her not being able to handle the fact that she's been found out and looks bad."
"And OP, from a lady's perspective - clean up your apartment before you go out. No clothes lying around, no dirty dishes, no scummy bathroom. Bed made. She might not come back to your place or you might not decide to ask her back, but just in case you do, it might as well make a good first impression too! "
"OP, if I were you I'd find out how he connected the dots. You are a SW engineer, you have the background to do so even if it might take some Google-fu. The reverse image search is a good one, can you think of any others? I say this because depending on how he found it, this could be extra-creepy or even illegal. 

One way would be to ask him. ""Boss, I was wondering, how did you find my blog? Usually I try to keep that dissociated from my name, as it's private... Did I mess up somewhere?"". It has the added benefit of sending the clear message that he was wrong to dig it up. If he gets defensive, frame it as you want to improve your web security skills.

Edit: is your blog on a domain registered to your name? That is one easy way he could have found it. If you're comfortable doing so, PM me your blog, and I'll let you know if I can figure out how to trace it to your real name."
"I don't care what he says, he cheated on you with another woman in your own home while his friend helped him out. I don't see you being able to come back from that...

Imagine having to kiss him, have sex with him, or even looking him in the eyes. Imagine the next time either you or he goes out of town and you're staring at your phone wondering if he's cheating again... It's such a ridiculously large breach of trust, I don't buy his getting too drunk explanation at all, he must've wanted to cheat internally, it just came out this way.

Contact a family law lawyer and start divorce proceedings. I am so sorry this is happening to you."
"Given that his drawings include birthmarks which show he's been peeping at her naked, it's not a made up naked body. Stop saying silly things. "
"That's so strange to me personally. Like, I arrange and plan things for me and husband but he also does the same. As we both do it it kinda shows appreciation and the want to please the other person and make them happy. If it's only one half of the relationship making all the effort there's only one half of the relationship making the conscious effort. Does that make any sense at all? I re read it and couldn't word it any better! Sorry "
"You have to tell her the truth. Not only did you cheat, but you lost your virginity doing it, which was probably something special that she thought you'd do together. She honestly should break up with you if she has any self-respect. "

"He mildly screwed up, and could have been more aware and considerate. 

But it's a mild screw-up. It sounds like you are also overreacting a little bit - treating a mild screw-up like a major screw-up. 

The actual harm here (some free stuff went to people other than who it would have gone to) is very minor, so I'd encourage you to accept his apology and let it go. "

"&gt;  I don't think he'll be sad not seeing her.

Yeah, I think the dog will be fine.

When I was in high school, my aunt had this little black chihuahua-terrier mix thing-I don't know what the heck mix he was, but he was a sweet little dog that loved everyone and was VERY loyal and obedient.  He was probably about 8 or so years old when I was in HS, and my aunt asked me if I wanted him (since he and I were best buddies-I was his second favorite person).  She had a problem with her neighbors calling animal control for any stupid reason you could think of-many times, just out of spite.  The officer that worked that area was a real jerk to my aunt over the years, and she was afraid they'd end up taking this dog and never bringing him back, so I gladly took him.

I think after a day or two, he was completely fine.  He slept with me, followed me wherever I went, inside and out (I lived on 15 acres).  He knew my aunt when she'd come over (we lived in the same town), but it was like we had reversed roles. 

OP's dog will be fine.  Hell, my malamute that I have now doesn't even miss me when my parents watch her for me (sometimes for a week at a time-they have 6 dogs of their own).  She's happy when I come get her, but they say she just makes herself at home."
That was my first response. I suggested a few of my pistols may be a modern equivalent.
"Do you want OP killed by the Russian Mafia, because that's how OP gets killed by the Russian Mafia"
"I've tried asking her about it. She refused to acknowledge that she's doing anything different. And she has always joked in that way, I do, too. Like when she goes on business lunches I'll say she's meeting her sugar daddy or something. But I don't do that *every time* and it's very clear that I'm joking. 

With her? Not so much. And she's doing it constantly. But she denies that she's doing it more frequently or that it is anything but joking. I haven't changed anything in my habits. I don't know why she's suddenly so ""jokey""."
"As your father has known your friend since childhood and now also wants to abandon the child, it's akin to pedophilia to me. Really gross and irresponsible. Your resentment towards your dad is completely justifiable. 

However, I do understand your friend. An older person gave her attention and she didn't want to lose his approval. To continue the relationship she had to keep it secret. It was dumb, but wanting to feel loved is not dumb. The extent of the power play is why this is so gross. Your father abused his position. 

I think you should support your friend after your feelings cool down. She might still take your father's side, but you have to consider that he's been fucking up her brains since she was 14. Just let her know you'll be there and set boundaries such as ""I don't want to talk about the relationship"" etc.

"That's not actually a hard question, OP. It's actually pretty easy to answer the question why a 75-year old man wants to marry a 19 year-old woman.

The harder question is: Why a 19 year-old woman wants to marry a 75-year old man with no obvious pecuniary benefits?

I read and re-read your post. Have you actually talked to your sister and expressed your concerns &amp; views, directly and unequivocally?

As for the wedding- the cost to you is minimal. And there may even be a morbid curiosity. If this blows up in your sister face, which it seems there is a reasonably large chance it will, you don't want have a rift between you and your sister because you and your brother wanted to make a statement of not being at her wedding. It would be a stumbling block toward helping her rebuild. The age difference you have between your sister now seems large, but in a few years- she'll be 27 and you'll be 24, a much less significant experience gap. She's gonna need you in the future. Protect that- even if it means swallowing this now.

Go- and for the love of God, take pictures."

I don't think I get this. You're an adult. Wear what you want to wear. You are not required to coordinate outfits with your friends.
"But you aren't 75 either. Get back to me when you're down and out, 75 and a 19 year old wants you. A lonely 75 year old you will take that company."
"Yeah I do know that lot of the things he claimed he disliked about him are kind of ""black stereotypes"" I didn't notice it initially but my brother brought it up and it's an interesting point. I honestly think he doesn't care about all that and was just looking for random things to dislike about him. I'm sure if it was a white person who played basketball and listened to rap he wouldn't care as much. "

"Also, as for advice, you always come first. Stay somewhere safe. Tell your dad that Toby violated you, you feel unsafe, and until that situatuon can be rectified, you won't be returning."
You should tell everyone he hits women. That should ruin his image.
Your wife has some really messed up priorities.  You should treat your kids fairly.
"It's maybe rational to *think* that. But it's also rational to know that your girlfriend has feelings, and that *saying* things like that are going to hurt those feelings immensely. Just like you wouldn't say, ""Well, I'd honestly prefer a guy with a bigger penis than you have, but yours will suffice."" I mean, you can't take shit like that back.

So, I guess for me it'd partly depend on whether it was something he said *once*, but then wished he hadn't. Or if it's something he's made clear multiple times, even after knowing that it bothered you, because, ""Well, it's the truth, I don't wanna lie."" Saying it once could be just a stupid 'foot-in-mouth' moment, but it'd say at least something about who he is. Saying it multiple times, etc., - that just means there's a big asshole streak in him that doesn't give much of a shit about your feelings. You've gotta figure out where he stands on that spectrum, and decide if you want to deal with this for the rest of your life with this guy. I'm thinking that you might be better off with someone who's *thrilled* to have you - no ifs, ands or buts about it."

The way this should work is the director communicates the expectations to your boss, your boss should take those same expectations from the director and push that to his people and that clearly is not happening.

I guess look hard at the photos. Are there any clues as to when they were taken? Newspapers, calendars, etc. in the background? When were they posted to facebook?

If the girl is 24 now, your bf is claiming that she was under 20 when he started dating her -- does she look different in the photos versus her facebook profile now? And assuming her bf is being honest, how do you feel about him dating an 18 or 19 year old?"

Medschool is only the beginning, I took a slightly circuitous route, but I'm over a decade out of medschool, only just a specialist and moving countries for more experience.

When we're having a bit too much, he frames it like ""we only have a certain amount of time together each day, and while the sexytimes are amazing, it's important to me that the emotional connection is balanced too"". So we spend time together talking, holding each other, going for walks, doing activities, giving massages, etc etc. It means we live a really full life, and we don't have time for ""too much"" sex.

"You should look into ""avoidant attachment"" styles. Once you identify the problem, you can work on it. I would recommend therapy.

&gt; The Avoidant/Dismissing Attachment Style in Adults
   
&gt; People who formed an avoidant attachment to their parent or parents while growing up try to steer clear of emotional closeness and intimacy in their new relationships. They tend to feel uncomfortable with physical contact and attempt to limit affectionate and sexual exchanges with their partner in order to maintain a more comfortable or “safe” distance in the relationship. They value the friendship aspects of a relationship, but look down on romantic love, passion, commitment, and satisfaction.  Other adults identified as “avoidant/dismissing” are loners; they prefer isolation and are primarily interested in practical matters.

and

&gt; The dismissive attachment style is characterized by a positive view of self and a negative view of others. Those who fall into this category view themselves as worthy and deserving of love but feel that others are not worth trusting. They often feel that they are capable of loving but that potential partners are not trustworthy, are not supportive and are likely to disappoint them. Given that they fearful to open up and be vulnerable with others, they become very avoidant of intimate relationships. They may claim to be overly independent, claim that they don’t need others and act as though their relationships are not a priority to them."

My dad has always given in to his parents no matter what, so my mum eventually agreed and decided that one more child was okay. Well surprise! My brother and sister are twins. My grandparents finally decided to come visit us (they didn't bother seeing me when I was born) and to help look after their golden grandson. Eventually my mum kicked them out because apparently my grandparents would leave my sister alone at home for hours (at less than a year old...) and take my brother out for walks. 

They live alone in separate parts of a nursing home now, with all of their children and grandchildren in different countries. None of my siblings or cousins or I speak to them anymore. Tbh I really wish my dad had had the guts to stand up for himself."

"1. No. The moment your biological mother abandoned you, she gave up her rights to be called ""mom."" Most likely your grandmother's upset about who you call mom because she feels like by not calling your bio-mom ""mom"", you're also distancing yourself from her (your maternal grandmother). So reassure her that, that's not what you're doing. Try explaining to your grandmother that you give the title of family to the people who actually treat you like family. That means your dad (bio dad), your mom (step-mom), and your grandmother. Hell, tell her the story about your birthday night to drive home the point that the title of ""mom"" goes to the woman who actually treats you like you are their child. Who has shown you that she will love you **unconditionally**, regardless of where your biological material came from.

2. No. You don't owe them anything and it's fucking wrong that your step-father is trying to emotionally blackmail you into forgiving them when they've **done nothing to earn your forgiveness**. You tell them that. If they want your forgiveness then they need to earn it."

Even if the ex-wife could help out financially, your two children that live together should have the same opportunities, birthdays, experiences, etc. How awful it would be for your son to think his 'mother' (the one he's going to grow up with and know as his mother) think that she loves his sister more and that she'll always be more important. 

You are not wrong for thinking she has an incorrect attitude. Maybe you need to have a conversation that better illustrates the ill-effects this will have for your son as he grows up."
"Personally, I'd like a clearer sense of the timeline here. Best I can work out, OP's husband cut the kids out of his life during the first two years of their friendship. So she didn't know him while he was in the thick of things and only tangentially witnessed the end of all this. Is it possible that he really did spend years desperately trying to connect with his children? Yes, absolutely. But it's also possible that he was a lot less invested (or had been less invested in years past) than he let on to OP who was, at that time, merely a friend. I'm not sure she was in a position to actually know what the relationship between OP and his kids was like at any point."
Kids won't mind either way. They like ex's parents but they are much more closely bonded to mine.
Alarm bells started going off as soon as he hurt her feelings and then got mad at her for being upset. Then berated her and blamed her for being upset painting himself as the victim. 
"Definitely gaslighting. And then blaming her for his shitty behaviour. I hope OP realizes this is how he'll act throughout their relationship and it'll probably get worse. All I see are abusive red flags here.
"
"They just sound like shitty people. Like, really shitty people."
"And you weren't.  So basically in her eyes you have exhibited the following behaviors

- fishing more important than her and your child

- avoiding helping for special family event

- breaking a promise to her(be back on time)

- causing her an extreme amount of worry at the same time due to lack of contact.

- every single one of these shows exactly how thoughtless you were and exactly how little you cared about them compared to you wanting to go fishing.  

Good luck with that.  Time to grow up a bit and realize you are part of a family and that most of the time the family is going to come first."
"Also if you manage to leave (please do), perhaps get a copy of all your siblings' passports, IDs, document etc. along with your own and keep them in a safe place. Somewhere secret, like a security deposit box or something. Outside your home. "
"&gt;I also thought I was starting to sound like a creep and pressuring her into sex. 

And you would be right. 

She opened up to you about something painful and frightening for her, and you responded by offering to have sex with her and then shooting down all of her ""excuses"" for declining your offer. 

You made a bad judgment call here and you should apologize and not do anything like this again in the future. "
"Are you a therapist? Your response took my breath away, I hope it is a wake up call to him and me. You have no idea how much this helps me."
"I'm 6'4"", 185 lbs, and I'm trying to gain weight. Something seems very wrong here to me.

Screw this dude's nasty behaviors, you don't need that in your life, but yes, please go to a doctor because there's a possibility you have a skewed perception of weight."
"What was the point of forcing her to change them to English if he was just going to say she changed the names anyway? He clearly *wants* to think poorly of her, so there's literally nothing she can do to change his mind. "
"Yeah, no phone. No car privileges. No computer access. More chores. After school job at OP's workplace or under a family member/uncle -- all would put pressure on Daniel to rethink his choices."
"You're 14. At this age you get more say in your custody arrangements. I was 14 when I first asked that my custody schedule be modified and then I did the same when I was 16. If this is what you want, then ask for it. Your mom doesn't have as much authority to say ""no"" as she did when you were 8, or 12, or even last year.

I would, however, suggest you make this request more diplomatically than I did. Perhaps something like, ""Mom, I have lived with you during the school year for X number of years. I'd like to spend more time living with Dad. I think it is his 'turn' and I enjoy doing _____ and _____ with him and I'd like more time to do those hobbies with him.""

If your Mom resists and if this is something you really, really want, you can ask your Dad to initiate the custody modification."
"I had a shitty relationship with my mother and I constantly got shit from other women about it. ""She's the only mother you'll ever have"" and other such nonsense. 

I wish I had had the strength I do now when I was in college. I would have told a lot more to people that they didn't know what they were talking about and that they needed to shut the fuck up and go away with their unasked for, unwanted, unneeded, inaccurate advice."
"Good. She cares about you. This is a good time to discuss safety plans. Remember you can also call 911 and they will take you to a hospital for treatment if you have an attack and cannot get help.

There is a desire to not be a burden but your aunt took responsibility for you. She wants you to be healthy and safe. Don't fear interrupting her. Tall to her about it."
"You'd think by 19, he would know better than to risk a family member's life. What a complete and utter poot."
"We really don't have enough information, here. You may be hurting him, and it actually is defending himself, or he may be a strait up sadist. There isn't enough to go on. It kind of sounds like he's doing the same things back to you, but you are the one injured. 

If the playing around is too rough, why do you initiate it, then? Maybe just don't play fight? "
Especially since he's an adult and she's a minor. 
"&gt;You are paranoid a little bit..think too much and there is always another version of the story. 

passed out on the couch with dried poop in the diaper and piss dripping out of it? Yeah I'm really curious, there has to be a rational explanation right? /s

&gt;Reading your side makes you 100% right and that's never a case. 

great observation dr house.

&gt;She told you she will kill you and you missed to say what you responded to that?

he said he laughed it off a bit because it was so absurd. Still don't see how his reaction matters. Threats are threats.

 &gt;You are talking behind her back with her ex..

 hey Honey I'm going to contact your ex husband to confirm my suspicions that you are crazy and abusive, you OK with that? 

 &gt;Kidnapping baby in the middle of the night..

 saving a baby from abuse

 &gt;Afraid of women.. 

 what? 

&gt;Not able to communicate..

Don't see where you got this from

&gt; Don't have a job.. 

 he stayed at home to care for his baby, or do you think SAHM's are bad parents too?

&gt;I hope someone normal get a custody of that poor baby.

Yeah your focus has really been on the welfare of the baby.


Sorry but this may be the dumbest and most unhelpful comment I've ever read on this sub. Good job.

"He also had the audacity to say ""wrong answer""...I just stared at him. Like...you asked me. Don't be mad at the answer, especially considering your track record with me. "
"Couples therapy is not an option. I suggested is a few years ago when I first started feeling really unhappy with our situation, and she immediately shot it down, saying that nobody knew us better than ourselves so therapy would never work."
That's a super good point. She was in the house with her kids for nine days without this happening.
Why not continue to only wear it for social engagements and get a different (cheaper) ring that you wear more often. Or just wear the wedding band.

"I didnt even realize there was a issue (raised uber christian/religious) until I went to get into college, I had to take remedial math classes and then had to get a tutor I was so far behind. Tutor said my math skills stopped at 6th grade...

Thanks mom! /s"
"Not overloading a coat hook to a point where it snaps and falls is common sense. And when it happens over and over again, someone has to say SOMETHING. That doesn't mean it's called nagging. He shouldn't have to get credit just cause he simply attempts to do a half assed job. He's an adult with responsibilities, and he needs to do them satisfactorily. "
But you're trying to trade sex for chores. That's incredibly disturbing in the context of a marriage. 
"Testicular torsion is one of those unfortunate things that just happens sometimes in life. There are so many causative agents that can cause it, especially in younger children/teens. 

There is no need to put blame on yourself for one of those random mishaps in life."
"What if he creeps on her when she goes to the bathroom, and the adults are distracted?  This a fucking hell to the fuck no situation."
"&gt; he says he is opposed to saying 'I will not bring this up again' as a matter of principle (because that means he is not truly expressing his feels).

So basically his feelings matter more than anything. Ew. "
"that's fine, just realize that as a result of you being too lazy to do the basic things that acknowledge you care for these people that you're going to find yourself alone.  You're telling them you're either too lazy or they don't matter enough to you to warrant the time.  Honestly, you kinda seem like a ass."
"Yeah, not a wise choice, man. Just get a lawyer and have an actual child support arrangement made."
It also reminds me of that metafilter post about Emotional Labour that were filled with story after story of women talking about how their husbands would disappear into gaming mode and forget that they weren't living with their mothers
"&gt;  I have nothing but appreciation for the women who perform in it

Would you marry one?  I'm honestly asking, because I see a lot of guys who claim they don't look down on those women or judge them for what they do, but would never date or marry one."
 He just wants to fuck around and you don't. Why are you wasting your time on this loser? Break up and find someone who will want you and only you.
"What did you come here for? What advice did you want to get? You seem to be fighting the advice of everyone in this thread. Do you think 100+ comments are wrong and you are the correct one? There are many options for you but you seem content with shutting down and saying ""but I can't"" to every possible suggestion. If you don't want to ditch the abusive husband and take steps to improve the lives of your kids, your life is going to get much shittier, and your kids are going to be fucked up as they get older. "
I wish we didn't have to gender flip things to see who the asshole is in a situation.
The family I mentioned had safely coslept with their 5 other kids before the 6th died. You *do not know* that you wouldn't sleep through it. It only takes one incident.
"It's not true, because a truly nice person wouldn't care if I've dated a black man in the past. Because racists aren't really nice people. "
How is someone *this* dense.
Or OP can live with his mom and his dad and replacement family can reap the consequences.
You totally miss the point. So entitled. Do you always refuse to face the consequences of your actions?
"Right? I mean, if OP wanted to use someone for their money, I'm pretty sure she could find a better option than this wastrel. Good lord. Talk about manipulation via projection. And I love the way he claims to know nothing about credit cards, yet was knowledgeable enough to get himself set up as an authorized user on her card account and add a card for himself. Cute. "
How can you compare illegal prostitution to cheating? Do you realize how 'illegal prostitution' works? Do you realize the position majority of the women have when 'choosing' (as far as choosing goes) that type of work?
"Do not sacrifice your life for ANYONE else. A wife is supposed to supplement your happiness (and vice versa of course), not destroy it. "
I was expecting *at least* that they had gotten into it over a social issue....but over her being passionate about the sentence of someone who actually attacked her? Even if she's completely against it you'd think she'd have a little compassion for the feelings that experience would inspire.
1. You need to find the kids parents and apologise either by letter or in person.
"She says in another post that he plays video games for hours a day and she plays with him even though she hates it, so apparently it's only a problem when she's doing something he doesn't want to do.

These two have big issues, and the problem isn't OP."
"So I work in the dental field and wanted to let you know that you should absoutely encourage her to see a dentist. Especially if she's in pain that could indicate an active infection. Which is bad for the whole body.
A lot of times to get implants placed or even to have dentures fabricated a person needs to have the teeth removed and needs to heal for a minimum for 6 months before they can start to make the dentures, or place the implant screws. She's in pain and even if she had money tomorrow to go to the dentist they would be unable to replace her teeth the same day. The procedures to make the restorations just require healing, there's absoutely no way around it. 
I've worked with people who all of their teeth are broken around they haven't been to the dentist in 20 years and have never looked down on them or judged them, it's my job, and I understand that life happens and that we are only human, so please encourage her and reassure her that she's going to a place free of judgment and that they only want to help her get out of pain. Also for a first appointment they will probably start by just taking x-rays and doing an exam to map out the treatment plan, and to possibly get her on antibiotics to get an infection to go down. Also that way she can have a financial estimation of what she's looking into. A lot of offices offer free New Patient exams if she's can't afford that, also dental schools are phenomenal and will be more cost effective.
But please, she needs to see a dentist asap.  "
"*She apparently thinks he is not that attractive now that she thinks about it.*

Hahahahaha...okay, that's out of my system. She doesn't see the disrespect or care about that. She's only saying what she is now to throw you off her trail so that she can continue to gush over your friend presumably without you being suspicious. She's going underground. And she'll still bang him if she gets the chance.
"
"OP wasn't involved with their domestic affairs, though? She just went to a party.

Do you send psychotic messages to every girl your boyfriend comes into contact with, or something?

"
Aren't most high school posts on here like bad high school romcoms?  I think it might just be high school in general.
"I'm starting to feel like the behavior comes more from his sisters part, and your boyfriend thinks it's normal so he goes along with it. I mean come on, hasn't had a boyfriend for more than a month?, yet she can call her brother and say ""come over and watch movies and cuddle"", and why go on dates when she can go to her brothers? sounds like a three-way relationship to me. The only thing that they don't do is have sex, other than that their behaviors towards each other checks out as a couple."
"It's different for everyone, and you can't take away the pain. I think the most helpful thing anyone said to me during my divorce was ""Be kind to yourself."" I remember thinking it was a little odd at the time, and it came from an acquaintance, not a close friend. But it was so easy to be down on myself. There were times I actually went back and read the email, to see the words on the screen.

I say it to others sometimes, and I never know if it helps them at all. But I'll say it again here, for the OP.

Be kind to yourself."
You know who gets a say? The person who has to be married to him. 
"&gt;Is it really illogical to assume something is up...


No. But it is illogical to assume that the something is definitely cheating rather than an explanation that doesn't involve betrayal. That's the part I don't understand. Your post describes a fight that seems like a ""straw that broke the camel's back"" situation on her part. I don't understand why it seems so much more likely that she's cheating vs the increase in mental stimulation of getting out of the house and spending time with adults has lead to an increase in energy and desire or an increased awareness of her unhappiness with the current state of your relationship. Why are you leaping to accusations? "
"It would only be meaningful if you loved him too, which you don't.

Yes, he's dying, which is obviously awful, but it doesn't give him a free pass to manipulate you.

It's ultimately your decision, but from what you've said I think you should stick with the hooker idea or just stay out of this situation completely."
"I have to say, being a bridesmaid, there were so many day-of expenses that me or my SO covered. Coffees for entire bridal party, snacks, running around to get last minute things. It's kind of how it is. 


Also, people often get tunnel vision around their wedding. There's all this stress and pressure (especially with an out of town wedding), and they become extremely self-centered. I've ranted on here already about how weddings don't need to be like that, but it is just how things often are.


I guess it comes down to delivery. There's a huge difference between ""the shoes aren't with the tux, you need to get your own"" and ""I'm sorry! I forgot to mention shoes don't come with the tux. Did you bring your own?"".


Taking responsibility for stuff quickly is really important, but it's not exactly a common trait. 


Still, I think a general rule of thumb is that you don't complain about anything wedding-related to the bride or groom. Sigh. You should probably let this all go.


If he lacks thoughtfulness and consideration in your general friendship, to the point where it makes you wonder if you want to have him in your life, then that's a separate issue. If it's pretty confined to the wedding, let it go. Fiances are often shitty friends."
"""Dress for the slide, not for the ride."""
I'm going to be blunt. Who gives a fuck about previous commitments when it's literally killing him. TWO surgeries because of the stress?? That's ridiculous. It's not fair that she's asking him to sacrifice his physical and mental health. He didn't completely quit and they are still going to have plenty of money to retire early. 
"I'm glad you accepted, but I also implore you not to dampen her fun with this ""and we won't be splurging the way she is used to on vacations"" as some others have pointed out. It seems a bit selfish to control how she spends her money if it has no negative effect on you besides pride. "
"And you didn't shut down jokes from your friends that made that very apparent.  You don't say ""my friends crack joke.""  That doesn't help at all.  That's literally defending your friends making fun of your boyfriend for something you know bothers him a lot.  "
"Yes. He is very controlling. 

You are both pulling an income. He doesn't have the right to only give you an allowance of YOUR OWN MONEY. 

Monitoring your facebook is bad enough. Posting things on your facebook, basically putting words in your mouth to shout to the masses, is not ok. 

Him not letting you go where you want is also not ok. 

None of this is OK! "

"You should talk with him about it again saying that this is a girl that he had a threesome with, not just any old friend and remind him of the reasons why you guys picked her.  Don't let him manipulate you by snooping through his phone.  Ask him when he was going to tell you about the coffee date if you hadn't found out on his phone.  And if he feels the need to keep this from you, he knows he's doing something wrong and it isn't just a friend."
"I have experience in this. I changed my legal name to something different because I didn't like my birth name. 

Look, if your brother was female and getting married no one would say anything about it. Changing his name due to teasing or harm is perfectly legit. Your dad gave him a stupid name."
"&gt; Would I talk about it with friends if the ""very casual sexual encounter"" involved a _mutual friend_? Ehhhhh, maybe, but at the same time, I would hope I would have the wherewithal to realize that this could very well bite me in the ass.

This ^"
"&gt;  I was seriously contemplating abortion because I was so happy with the life we had with just the two of us- why would I go ruin such a good thing by getting pregnant?

Have you found anything to help with that? Because those are my exact fears and they've only intensified since I've been off of birth control. Like we both want kids and all but I don't want to ruin a good thing. I actually had an abortion about 8 months before we got married partly for this reason. "
[deleted]
You have to get out of this relationship ASAP.
Ignoring it invites further discussion later on.
"To be fair, she's clinically underweight, exercising hard daily, and perceives him to be ""lazy"" and a ""shadow of his former self"" for not wanting to exercise to lose weight when the man is well within a normal BMI for his height. This shows a distortion of reality on the part of OP. A trip to the doctor isn't unwarranted."
"&gt; See the thing is he probably spent a lot on the 21 presents

Then you need to get over this.

&gt;  seem ungrateful

You are ungrateful."
well congrats on the job too by the way!!
"No means no, that's sleezy af. Don't give him the satisfaction of your attention. If you want it to stop, call management and let them know, or go to a different bar."
Just dump him girl. Tell him you found his posts and it's over. Thousands of dollars is nothing compared to the emotional exhaustion you're going to be living with when you're married to a raging dumbass misogynist. The money is not worth your sanity.
"Yes. She normally goes into our bedroom or my office and reads or watches Netflix. The older kids know not to bother mommy during that time unless their is a life-threatening emergency, and I keep our youngest with me while I take care of things around the house or work. "
Easy for you to love... It's not your body getting wrecked.. 
"I'm sorry, but you *knew* this dog was part of the deal with moving in with him and now getting married to him. What did you expect? Him to ditch his dog on the side of the road when you moved in? Dumping her at a shelter? Selling her on Craigslist and hoping she doesn't end up as a bait dog in a fighting ring?

If you can't handle the dog, then leave. Period. 

OR, if you want to make things work with him and the dog, sit him down, talk to him, and have him *and* yourself go to obedience classes.
Yes, you too. You need training as well as to the proper ways to handle and command a dog just as much as the dog needs proper training to be a better behaved pet so you can coexist. 

*You signed up for this*. Now deal with it."
"It's worth a shot if she's really that eugenic; Height is determined mostly by generics. The more different equally short people are in genetics though, the taller their children. So an Asian and a Puerto Rican would have taller children than two Puerto Ricans. Nutrition also matters a lot. 

My general advice: make her explain why. My guess is since you both see being short as negative, she won't change her mind unless you both fully address that insecurity. Suggest couples counseling to sort it out, with the condition that she must be honest about expectations. If this was really her reason then she lied to you for a while, and that deserves a very honest apology. Not having kids is a fairly major twist to do to a partner for such a shallow reason. "
"Here's what I read: 
&gt; I have been catching my girlfriend several times snooping around my phone and laptop 

&gt; To me, this is an automatic deal breaker.

&gt;  I explained to her that I would break up if I see this again

&gt; she did it again and wasn't even discrete about it.

&gt; she is stalking me

What you can do is tell her one final time that you are absolutely, unequivocally done with the relationship, that name-calling, stalking, and sending others to argue on her behalf will not change your mind, and that if she does not leave you alone you will pursue a restraining order. 

Next, cut all ties. Get a new phone number, block her on FB, do not read, acknowledge or reply to any message she might get through to you. Let mutual friends know you cannot be around her. Finally, move if necessary, but document everything that has happened and continues to happen, as you may need to actually pursue a restraining order. "
"Dude, what the fuck? She's saying right in your face that she cheated on you and will take the guy to the wedding and still making you believe it's YOUR fault! Stop being a doormat and dump her, she's using you."
"He likes to show you off. When he's with you, he likes the attention you get because you're ""his"" and he can be there to bask in how he's the guy with the hot girlfriend. When he's not around to ""claim"" you, the fact that you look good obviously makes him insecure. It's all about him -- the way you dress up is essentially just there to boost his ego, so when he's not there, he doesn't think there should be a reason for you to look nice. 

That's what it seems like to me, anyway. I would make it clear to him that you're not an object and not his possession, and that you dress that way for yourself, not him.  Then continue wearing the things you like wearing. The first person your clothes should make happy is *you*; he isn't entitled to having his feelings considered in this situation."
"&gt; When we started dating she didn't have many friends, and I accepted these behaviors as her wanting to socialize more. Now that she has a group of friends (mostly guys from her work), she occasionally gets upset that I never get jealous or question her about hanging out with them. According to her, ""I don't care."" It's almost like she wants me to be angry?

She's trying to bait you.  She's someone who equates attention as an affirmation of how someone feels about her.  So when she doesn't have your attention (even for a brief time) she gets insecure/nervous/anxious. 

Let me ask you this - do you feel like she picks fights sometimes for the sake of fighting?  That is, any attention (even negative) is better than no attention at all?"
"&gt;I'm still not really sure if I am ever going to be okay with us again after all of this. I don't trust him at all which is extremely difficult to live with. We will go to couples counseling after he has had individual for a while and then go from there. Divorce is not off the table for me and he knows that and that isn't what he wants so hopefully he will keep working on himself. 

If you haven't already done so, consult with a divorce attorney to find out what steps you should be taking now to protect yourself later if you do decide to proceed with a divorce.

It can be hard to breathe after a huge life altering event and the sadness can weigh on you to the point of cracking. But you'll keep going and slowly you'll hurt less and laugh more. Hope very much this helps.
"Those symptoms aren't even the biggest problem. Sleep apnea kills people. When he stops breathing, he will probably start up again, but there's no guarantee. Plenty of people die this way. It's especially dangerous if weight is a contributing factor. Sleep apnea should not be left untreated. 

Until he gets the machine, he should not be sleeping on his back at least. "
"The kids had no idea what was going on.  For all they knew, I was in the other room watching TV.  My sisters told me to stop for the duration of the trip and I told them I would do what I wanted to do as long as I didn't teach the kids anything they didn't want them to know.  

As far as the girl goes, she told me her parents knew we ""hung out"" at night and just didn't want her bringing me back to their place, which I totally understand."
"Woah, you are kind of wretched. Not because you are dating someone she is interested in, but because of the way you describe her.  You put her in an ""unattractive"" box because she is different from you?  I hope  for her sake your friendship doesn't recover.  She doesn't need a shitty person like you in her life. "
"Allowed to be angry - but also kept safe, and kept from harming others."
"They know she's like that and they don't care. ""She's just a kid"". Everyone spoils her rotten. She has the iphone 6S, has two ipads, etc etc. 

I sadly can't get roommates (1 bedroom apartment lease with no sublease allowed) or an extra job (no-other-job clause with my grad school). I'm going to start eating much more frugally and canceling my tv / netflix / spotify subscriptions."
"That's exactly what it is. It could also be, at the same time, she thought they would ease into it. 

""Go for it"" for her probably meant flirt, maybe mess around a little bit, but nothing else is most likely to happen......and then not only does it happen, but it happens AGAIN the very next night? That's sort of a double whammy if you thought you were ready for something and it came at you too fast. She thought she was, and she was obviously wrong.

I don't think it's as simple as she thought she'd get tail, and he'd stay at home...but it's probably a little part of it, at least."
"Well, I think you're in the right, that it's not a big deal, and that they're overreacting. But, if you're financially dependent on ignorant religious parents, you had to know they wouldn't just be okay with how you were living your life. And they can put whatever conditions they want on your tuition and living money, even if it's for ignorant or irrational reasons. If there's any reasonable way you can support yourself financially without them (work more, get loans for school), then you can take the high road and let them cut you off for ridiculous reasons. If you can't, then you're basically at their mercy. It sounds like they want you to come groveling back to them, which you might have to do to get your education and a good job so you can be independent of their rules."
"And there is a lot of politics mixed with teaching spanish and catalá, so I will examine the possible bias of the authors before believing in anything. My cousins were raised in spanish and catalá and they are fluent in both and they have never had any problems with speech fluency in either language, but when they were very little and they sometimes mixed words in both languages"
I wouldn't do anything except being careful around her.
"You dont, especially if you know he's straight. At best he feels bad for you at worst you lose a friend, there is no win in this situation. Sorry man."
"OP said that FIL has a tendency to try to invite himself to things.  It sounds like BIL wasn't thinking and told him, and then FIL jumped on it.  Why are you assuming this is a nefarious plot by OP's wife?  OP presents a perfectly reasonable explanation that has nothing to do with her.  OP's wife's only transgression is that she didn't uninvite her father when she found out, but OP doesn't even believe that uninviting him is an option, so I don't think we can fault her with that.  

OP, don't invite your parents simply to retaliate.  Calm down and think through the vacation plans again, and then make the decision on whether to invite them.  

Separate, but nearby, housing rentals could be key to making this still work. You can still hang out together but you aren't forced to.  

In the future, avoid this scenario by making it clear that you are looking at a specific housing rental with a limited number of spaces, and you are controlling the invitations.  "
"My thoughts exactly...what BC were you guys using? Do you know she was using it def, or just saying she was? Is she even pregnant for real? Anyway, tell her exactly what you told us here. Tell her you don't want to be in the relationship, state your reasons why...tell you will do your bit to support the baby if she has him/her (because that's the right thing to do!) but that the two of you wont be in a relationship. If she goes ahead with pregnancy then she must know all this, and know its legit. But please, for heavens sake do not stay with this woman for the sake of the baby. The baby will forever be used as leverage in any conflict you have (this assumption I make based on the personality you describe here).The baby will grow up in a highly dysfunctional house where mom and dad don't like each other or themselves. So yeah irrespective of the pregnancy, go through with break-up plans, but do not relinquish your support for the little one.  You might initially be branded as a shitty person for wanting out, but don't let that get to you...be UPFRONT with where you stand with the relationship and how you feel about it/ and her. The choices to follow RE the baby is hers then but at least she knows where she stands with you. 

Another angle to this, she might be faking the pregnancy cause she senses the pull away from her. I don't know- but it does sound extremely strange and unlikely that you would experience two unwanted pregnancies so close together. Although not impossible, but depending on the method used during the first abortion it is highly unlikely to happen again so soon. Either that or you have the strongest swimmers I have ever heard of. The drugs they give to induce the miscarriage messes with your system a lot and for some people can cause permanent damage to their fertility levels. But like I said, its not impossible- just unlikely."
I'd rather have a family member who has more materialistic tastes than passive aggressive cowards who think it's fun and mature to bully someone like that. And I say this as someone who thinks thrift shops beat Gucci any day. Glad I'm not in your family. Ya'll need to grow up
"Well, Chris is known for being a bit of an opinionated, loud-mouth so him ranting about shit he doesn't know anything about wouldn't be that far of a stretch. 


That's why I say we aren't really that good of friends with them. We don't have too much in common with them, except for the fact Ron and Chris work together now. 


That last bit does make sense. I know mine and Ron's personality are different, but I would have no problem saying to anyone, ""I may have had strong opinions about my husband in the past, but we're working things out and I deeply love/respect her. So, lay off."" 


Ron is a bit more passive than me, though. And that's the excuse he gave me - that he just wanted to ""get out of there"" so he didn't argue. But that still doesn't excuse the fact that he gave Chris the impression it was okay to speak about me like that.


One other thing that grinds my gears about this, I never spoke ill about Ron ever, even when we were separated. Does this mean he was shit-talking about me? And I would NEVER have anyone around me who would think it was okay to shit-talk especially about my husband. That's who I thought my husband was as well, so I'm just in utter shock."
"Thanks so much for your response. My Aunt has been completely silent, even on Facebook which she frequents, so my family is being extra cautious right now.

I took your advice and took witness statements from everyone present. I haven't gotten one from my uncle (married to crazy Aunt), but I'm sure he'd be on our side. 

Thanks again! "
"So you've been together for about a year and didn't tell him your ONS together resulted in a pregnancy that you aborted? I'm going to be the odd person out and say I think you really should have told him. That's a big deal. If it were just that you had an abortion I wouldn't think you'd have to tell him but it was his baby and I think he had a right to know. I'd have a hard time trusting you after this too. I'd give him time and hope that he comes around, trust is a hard thing to build again once it's been broken."
"whoa whoa whoa-I guess I missed that part bc I was too busy wondering how the Op could possibly have a fat stomach given her height and weight.

Op-dump him-thats one sure  way that you can be better."
"That's fine, I'll marry them again. Third time's the charm. "
"I don't get what you being so wealthy has to do with your resentment re: the open relationship but congrats I guess

just dump her so she can find someone who actually wants to marry her "
when and how did the brother know you guys had the 2nd priest lined up? that would influence how I'd think he should be handled just to know what things to do in the future to ensure he isn't aware of personal stuff like that. 
"That your brother is aware of all the things your dad has done and doesn't want to be like him is also why he won't be like him.

Let him know that every single thing your dad has done was because he made the choice to do so. There's no gene in your family's DNA that mandates all of the men on your dad's side before him were the same as your dad. (The world would be a miserable place if we were all destined to repeat the stupidity and mistakes of some of our parents.)

Your brother sounds like a really smart cookie and learned piles about what not to do in a relationship because of your dad. He won't make the same mistakes because he's seen the havoc those kinds of choices bring. 

Tell him to go ahead and give dating a whirl. He's going to take manners and chivalry to new levels and set standards his peers can only hope to achieve. "
"Conversion therapy camps are a real thing. Parents send gay kids away to a camp where the kids undergo 'therapy' to help them see that being gay is wrong and evil and that they're going to go to hell unless they accept that they actually do like members of the opposite sex. 

"
"I had the exact same reaction to ""shrill"" and mentioned it before reading your comment. You encapsulated this far more articulately than I did. "
"Also, be careful not to pay anything they ask, even a small amount. They will say things like ""Just pay ten bucks for now"" but as soon as you pay *anything* on the debt you're legally assuming the whole debt. Which is what they really wanted."
"I can assure you that if he is making multiple hundred plus dollar withdrawals often that the Vicodin issue is not just for ""when he is stressed."" If he is buying in that quantity and frequency he is already probably hooked, and that is going to be a long, hard road ahead to get clean. Knowing what you do now, if I were you, I would bail. For the right price, a man can get any kind of sex act that he wants at a massage place. How do I know? I had a few close friends back when I was younger who worked in places like those. They made an absolute killing, and 90% of their clients were married. If he went as far as to ask you if you knew if these places get busted--girl, he is going  ALL THE TIME. You don't need this. I would cut him loose. "
"Fantastic advice. I love the suggestion of asking questions. Because it really doesn't matter how ""gently"" you tell him...you're still attacking his decision, because you think it's wrong. But he thinks it is right so he will get defensive, angry and possibly become even more attached to his decision. Now all you've done is put a rift between you two, making it even more difficult to help him."
"Right?! Also his phrasing

&gt;she would do A LOT to repay me

I don't think OP is really interested. Would Jason really be better off with someone not interested in him? Sounds like he'd just be trading crap for crap. 
"I don't mean this in a snarky way, but on a scale of 0-10 how asexual are you? The number of atheists that wait until marriage must be incredibly low.

This reasoning just doesn't pass the sniff test."
"There's that and the mother was the parent they were most familiar with for pretty much their entire lives. Most of us go through life accepting our families and their word. From my personal experience, it is damn hard to piece together how awful one parent is when everyone around you is telling you the other parent is shit.

I don't know what the OP's husband should do or if the kids are really just gold digging like some people think, but I also think it's very possible that the kids finally figured it out and want to make amends."
He wasn't doing this on purpose and you were awful at communicating this issue with him...why the fuck are you mad

"Lol no, she doesn't own copyrights to the name of this character. If she wants to waste money and time and have a lawyer laugh her out of his office, then she should do this. "
"You poor thing. Is it possible for you to stay with a friend or a relative for a while? That is not okay for you to have such an enormous responsibility dumped on you. I would go somewhere else for a while, call CPS not only on the baby's behalf but on yours as well. You are still a minor and you are a minor that is raising someone else's baby that is not right and totally preventable if your mother were to just step in and put her foot down."
"Yeah the term ""slutty clothes"" rubbed me the wrong way too. OP should've said revealing clothes instead. And I agree that OP's boyfriend sounds incredibly insecure."
"Dear Lord, OP, don't be that credulous: ""...[he was] going to mention me if she asked or if things seemed to be heading in a flirtatious direction.""

The reason there is some much misery in marriage is people are not strict enough in their selection process. Your fiancé is actively engaged in seeking out other women. That is a hard ""Hell no!"" That is the clearest signal to terminate the relationship you will ever get. Not delay the marriage- break up permanently.

Are you not worth better? Do not marry because of inertia. Do not marry because of the embarrassment of canceling. Everyone will understand. And if they don't, they don't have your best interests at heard.

If you go through with this ill-advised marriage, please don't come back her asking how you can work through your husband's infidelities. You were warned."
"I mean...yes he is being romantic, but as others have said, the proposal should be about BOTH of you, so he should have considered what would have been romantic for her and what wouldn't have, which easily would have led him to realize that FF wasn't romantic for her. 

However, he did take her to a (romantic) spot they shared. I just think he could have thought about the ring a bit more."
"First, I'm really sorry for the loss of your father. 

I think the situation with the contractor is a good jumping point for a new conversation. I would sit her down and tell her that you know she loves you and wants the best for you, but you need a partner you can rely on to handle difficult situations when you're not able to be there.

She needs to know how seriously this problem is impacting not only *her* life, but the life you want to build together. I do think this is a problem that is fixable if she's willing to really work on it with someone qualified to help her. I wonder if the therapist she's seeing isn't the right fit for her if there's been no meaningful improvement in six years.

In your shoes, I would suggest looking into a new therapist who can work with her individually and with both of you as a couple. Be honest and let her know that her passivity is something you can't live with, and unless she's willing to make progress, you're looking at the end of your relationship."
Wow don't cut yourself with that edge. You're ether 14 or are mentally stunted or a troll. Fuck off. 
"I could really despise someone, but would still be disgusted by revenge porn of them. I wouldn't want to be with someone who not only wasn't, but took glee in it. I'm seriously disgusted by OP's girlfriend."
It sounds like you neglected your gf the entire trip and quite possibly the entire relationship. She told her friend that she loves you when you're there for her but this other guy is there for her more often. I think it's completely fair that she considered breaking things of with you for another guy who is more available and if you showed up at my house at 1 am unannounced I would be annoyed too.
Omg you're a fucking idiot
"Go to Denmark.  You need to put your education and career first.

Whether or not you leave for Denmark, the chances of this relationship lasting long-term are pretty low.  If you throw away the opportunity in hopes of keeping the relationship, you'll regret that decision. "
"Unfortunately, there aren't very many ways to say the right thing. 

And in a time when death isn't nearly as common as it once was, it's harder for people to come up to you and express sympathy for your loss.  The classy thing to do is to accept and appreciate the effort. "
"Your boyfriend is being unreasonable and controlling, and is gaslighting you into thinking that it's all about ""your health and well-being"".  
You should not be afraid of losing this guy; you should be afraid of *what will happen if you stay with him.*  
The fact that he feels entitled to have a say on what *you* do with *your body* is a gigantic flaming red flag. After four months, he has you thinking that he knows better than you do what is the best thing for you.  
Instead of trying to figure out how to convince *this guy* to go along with *what you already know is right for you*, you would be better off dropping him like loser that he is, and finding someone who will lift you up and support you instead of trying to stop you from doing what you already know is correct for you.  

He *absolutely does not think he is helping you*.  He wants to keep you under his thumb, and is probably hoping you *will* get pregnant, so he can tighten his grip even further."
"If she needs a cain, a short sentence might be life? "
"&gt; How hard is it to not solicit people for sex when your married? 

I mean... it doesn't even involve *doing* anything. All it requires is inaction. You can be the laziest motherfucker to accomplish this simple thing."
"Are you sure you are ready for marriage if you cannot even talk about such a major topic as sex with your fiance? You should not feel ashamed for having sex. I understand it is part of your beliefs to abstain from sex until marriage, but you're both being hypocrites (no offense) by engaging in underage drinking and drugs.

You *need* to sit down your fiance and talk to him about your feelings on physical intimacy. Please do not call it a ""mistake"" or make him feel guilty. Even if abstaining from sex is important to you, physical intimacy is a *huge* part of a healthy long-term relationship and, as such, should be vetted out prior to marriage no matter what. This includes discussing how to make the other one feel good during intimate moments. You should *never* feel ashamed to enjoy sex with your significant other.

Edit: Also, if you choose to continue having sex with your fiance, then you should take time learn about proper contraceptives to prevent an unplanned pregnancy. I'm assuming that due to your strict religious upbringing, you were not taught about the various forms of birth control."
"No. You're not having a physical relationship now; what happened before you got the job shouldn't matter. You're not required to divulge the details of past ""relationships"" with any of your coworkers."
"I get the impression a lot of sex offenders either straight out lie about or downplay their offenses. That's where those ""I am on the sex offenders' list for peeing in public"" stories seem to stem from. "
"Never put up with hypocrisy like that. If he expects you to watch him fuck another woman, he has to be happy to watch you fuck another man. "
"Seriously, I am not ""repressing my feelings"" or anything like that when I keep certain things to myself because they would be hurtful to others. That's pretty basic empathy."
This needs more attention. Plus in state tuition is a hell of a lot cheaper.
"There's hunting in the fall, college football games, skiing, and more. I may not have as much leisure time in the fall, but I still have weekends. Like someone else said, it also would give me more exposure to animals and agriculture, which is what I'll likely major in at college. "
"How sure can you be that it wasn't filmed longer ago? I mean, it's unlikely - it was uploaded a year ago and you've been together 3, and it's unlikely this dude just kept the videos 2 years before uploading. But I'd try and check - are the clothes she's wearing recent, is it filmed somewhere she visits now or used to a few years ago etc.

But if you're confident that it was filmed in the last 3 years I'd go ahead and send her a link and then cut contact."
"You're not obligated to do it. At all. 

Consider that he had many years before falling ill to admit he liked you and wanted to date. At that time you would've rejected a proposal to sleep together, I'm guessing.

The burden of his virginity isn't yours to bear. It's very sad that true love hasn't come his way, but if he opted to skip sex with other women in order to wait for you (logical or not), that decision rests with him.

Finding a different partner might be an option. "
"The Watchmen reference is lovely and this is very good advice. OP, this is a great lesson for both you and your dad. For you, it is how to be professional and look out for yourself. Get a reference from your father
 Get another job where you are appreciated. And for your father, it is to appreciate good employees based on merit."
"She's doing it for her own benefit. Still selfish behavior, just ignore and keep living your life without her."
"100% no. Put yourself first. The fact that she's even asking you to do this is remarkably inappropriate, disrespectful, and in my opinion a pretty damn big red flag."
"That's true. She doesn't HAVE to tell you. But out of respect to the relationship. She should have AT LEAST mentioned it. Also, she knows it was wrong which was made obvious by her reaction of you threatening to do the same thing. As for the saying she's a pos &amp; a hypocrite? That's manipulation. Shut that shit down.

Edited because I can English."
"My bad, I thought he posted here for advice.  By the same vein, none of you get to say it's unreasonable either, so I guess we're done here!"
"I can see why you and your brother have a strained relationship with your sister. She can't even communicate like an adult. 

Was she always prone to being dramatic and making bad decisions on the fly? Or is this new behavior for her? Part of me wonders if it's mental illness."
"&gt; It's stopped being only her body when she decided to get married.

Nope! I get that this is a flip-flop of epic proportions but still - nope! Marriage is not signing away rights to your body."

"No it's still insane. Trying to justify the way he completely discounts his wife and ignore her needs because he's just so tired and he just doesn't care doesn't make his spectacular leaps of (il)logic anymore reasonable. He refuses to acknowledge that he's had any responsibility for the deterioration of his marriage and now he's trying to justify his lack of interest with outlandish accusations and flimsy evidence. What's worse is that he comes here to rally support for his frankly ludicrous deductions and won't even attempt to address the fact that by his own omission he has been neglectful to get in and out of the bedroom. 

He provided details he clearly thinks are important and yet he's so focused on passwords that he's missing the forest for the trees. Maybe if he actually looked at the big picture instead of obsessing over whether his wife is pregnant with another mans child he could actually salvage his marriage."
"3 carats is flat out ridiculous, unless it's total weight carat size drives the price up exponentially and you can expect to pay in the low six figure range for a 3 carat stone. Just cursory googling found some as high as a quarter of a million bucks. She's doesn't know what she's talking about. Also Tiffany's is crazy overpriced. You could buy a nice house for what she wants to spend on a piece of jewelry."
"He's not bullying her. He would be telling her the truth. In no relationship is it okay to decide to completely change the marriage and future plans randomly without any consequences. He can tell her that he doesn't support her decision. She can do what she wants. That's the basics of adult communication. 

He is under no obligation to support her. She is under no obligation to change her mind. He is under no obligation to stay with her if he doesn't agree with her changing the future they planned together. "
"It's interesting that he wants to change his last name instead of first but I don't blame him at all for wanting to change it.  I always want to smack some sense into people who wants to name their kids something ""unique"" or ""special"" and the kid just ends up getting teased about it."
"I don't even understand how you could be confused by this interaction.  It is glaringly...glaringly obvious he has a big thing for you.

Not only that, he pushed your date and hit you in the face?  You need to put a stop to this, contact the police."
"The tabasco sauce isn't to kill the sperm. Air, hot water, soap, pretty much any cleaner in a bathroom designed to disinfect would pretty much get the job done, and if someone wanted to be extra sure, spermicide would be the most efficient seeing as its entire purpose is to kill sperm. 

The purpose of the tabasco sauce is to inflict pain and harm on women who apparently so blinded by the superior genetic material and dollar signs of child support that they actually put red semen inside themselves. It's not recommended unless your goal is to look like paranoid, egotistical nutcase who giggles at sadistic revenge scenarios."
He's saying all she should keep is her clothes. That's insane.
"Also, perhaps the therapist isn't very good."
"I'm not sure if he knows how to be an equal partner. He was raised by a single mom in a house his grandparents paid off, so I don't even think he had utilities in his name before we met."
"First of all, her parents clearly did not take this well. To be honest, when my cousin knocked up his future wife at 17, my aunt and uncle weren't happy either. 

Also, It strikes me that Katie is at an age where some girls feel the need to have a baby to feel loved. 

Her parents will come around. But Katie also needs to have a realistic expectation of the fact that they may choose not to. I know you're in the UK but you need to sit down with Katie and be frank, ask her about her immigration status. If she's here with her family on a work visa, this is going to make things complicated. 

It's probably best if you speak to lawyer who can help you sort this all out-- especially if she's involved with her moms work visa. I am sure one of the things the lawyer will also recommend is a paternity test for her, the baby, and your son.

You and your wife should also sit down together before you talk to them and talk together about what *you both* expect from them so that you're on the same page. When you sit down with them, be explicit. Go over the costs of raising this child. Does your son have a job? How are they going to pay rent? Food? Formula? Diapers? School? Baby clothes? At minimum, you expect them to enroll in a parenting class, both of them. 

They need to understand that they are responsible for their child. When it cries in the middle of the night for a bottle or a diaper change they are getting it you are not. "
"Do you have a good friend that you trust? If so, you could hand the letter over to them and put your trust in that person to read the letter and tell you if it's something that they believe you should read."
"Listen mate, as a parent I believe in being truthful and honest with my children at all times. Not to make them depressed or to worry, but to ensure that they understand that life is hard. 

I know it's hard for young adults not to be affected by such things that go on with in the family. But remember it's not your job to worry. It is your job to observe, to learn, to grow, to experience, to have fun and to do better. 

You know what? Nothing wrong with coming home from school and asking mum and/or dad ""is there anything I can do for you guys today?""  Even if they say no, the fact that you asked would mean the world to them. Then you have to forget about their problems and struggles and continue with your life, your friends, your homework. Remember it is there issue not your burden. 

Shutting yourself out might be easy for you but parents notice these things and they might be worrying for you, about you and that could be unnecessary stress. When you come home from school just start a conversation of all the positive things that happened to you during the day, something you thought was funny, something that totally pissed you off - they might welcome the distraction and I can't stress enough how much that will help you mentally and emotionally. Conversations don't cost anything and often brings family together. 

As for your birthday, could you sleep at a mates and have a few friends over?
Sometimes a family night of fun are the best memories we hold onto as we get older. A game night, board games, charades, poker - betting with junk food or chores or five cent pieces even?"
"He has a serious girlfriend. Why would you email him? What are you hoping to gain?

It's always easy to romanticize the people that we dated for a brief period of time at formative times in our life, but he's not that great a guy. He knew you had a boyfriend and was willing to help you cheat. You just never had a chance to get to know what he was really like, so you only remember him as an ideal.

Are you single now? I suspect you're going back through the proverbial old rolodex and thinking about the ones that got away. You're probably right that it'd be a good idea to 'get under someone else.'"
"What a horrible friend, enabling that kind of behavior. 

If I were OP, I'd absolutely BAN this ""friend"" from their lives, completely, 100%. What a trashy thing to do. Almost as bad as actually cheating. "
"Now imagine this same little 17 year old (after already being told once before to not do this) committed another crime in the process: DWI/DUI, cause a car accident, etc. 
Is it NOW finally the nephews fault? 
OP do yourself a favor and really think long and hard about what most of the commenters are saying. 
By allowing your nephew to see your niece as the ""reason"" behind bars, not only sets him up for a lifetime of blaming others, but also never having a real concept of what consequences are when you BREAK THE LAW family member or not. "
"You both are simply not mature enough to be married. 

He has a possible medical condition you don't want him to know about so that his wittle feels don't get hurt. 

Come on. Time to grow up."
"He literally just went apeshit on me and acted like he was going to hit me. I was like ""bruh, go ahead and hit a girl in a bar and see what happens"" and then I'm pretty sure he was escorted out. This was 10 years ago. I don't think I saw him around after that. 

Edit to add: the frat house he lived in was sort of an overflow house next to the official house. He wasn't and didn't claim to be a member of that frat, but word was he'd been a member of a different frat freshman year before dropping it. He talked a lot about his classes and major and stuff, but when all this happened, I searched the school directory and he wasn't even in it. 😂 there were way more lies in addition about his job, his ""modeling career,"" his family, his parents' careers that came out after. 

I should ask on fb if anyone knows whatever happened to him.... My 10 year reunion is in October. Maybe he'll be there. Lol. "
"I'm pretty sure my partner doesn't watch porn, and if he does it's extremely rare. He's very quiet about it either way and I think that's really respectful. We watched it once or twice together when things got really hot and that was the only time it came up. On the other hand, my ex watched upwards of 10+ videos a day and often sought out porn stars that had a particular look (pale skin, ginger, skinny) and that massively effected my self esteem, his sex drive was so little cause all he did all day was jerk off to girls I look nothing like.... I prefer my current boyfriends porn habits because I legitimately don't think he looks at it... But if he did I would be OK because he is very discreet about it. It's actually quite sweet"
"&gt; He still says he doesn't plan on it being this way forever but the way he reacted last night makes me uncertain if he really means that.

OP, don't stick around with the hope that he'll one day find it in his heart to only sleep with you. This is like girls waiting years for a proposal from a scared-to-commit BF because he's ""not ready"" and can't say when he'll be ready... if ever. If he isn't going to close it, tell him to call you when he wants to be exclusive, and walk."
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH IS OP FULL OF SHIT?
"IMO, it's not that she looks back fondly on a former relationship because I consider that to be normal. It's that she kept it hidden AND said she feels like she doesn't have closure. "
"That way at the very least regain your own reputation. As someone who worked in customer service my job was always so much easier to bear when these huge customer outbursts weren't just met with uncomfortable silence. Be the employee advocate, tell them loudly and proudly that that shit isn't going to fly."
"Considering how he's trying to gaslight her into thinking she has a mental illness/ED and that he'll only take her back if she treats it, this comment it is spot on."
Agreed. It's also a pretty go-to look for the parent-level generation. I had a bunch of aunts wearing pantsuits at my wedding. 
"Or if OP knows where the documents for the investment are (or even just the name of the bank/investment agency) he can go to the bank in person and ask them what can be done to protect his account from his parents or if there's already been withdrawals. To prepare for that, OP would need to find some identifying papers of his, since he's too young for a drivers license and I don't know if the bank will accept school id or driver's permit. It would be great if he has a passport. Anyways, this would be much cheaper first step than seeing a lawyer, and the people at the bank themselves can probably direct him towards right kind of lawyer."
"Even if he's done a ""180"", the fact that you still don't trust him and are full of resentment there's no reason to ever talk to him again.

Life is too short to be taken on emotional roller coasters like this. You're young, and he's been taking advantage of you for so long, I don't see this possibly working out. Time to move on."
"Trust, he is not in a crappy marriage. He knows you're disgusted by the behaviour and uses the most common excuse in the Cheater's Handbook to justify what he did. "
"""When we broke up, you essentially stole £130 from me by accepting a loan you never intended to pay back.  I'm not sure why you are getting back in touch now, but until and unless you pay back what you took from me, I have nothing more to say to you.""

I mean, to put it another way, if you paid that money to never deal with him again, you should either be getting your money's worth, or else get a refund.  

"
"If you were making a list of important qualities in a future partner, would homophobic, intolerant and ignorant be high on the list of things you want? Because that's what he's offering."
"You know, the first half of your comment is why you got downvotes (you don't have to be aroused to continue to stimulate your partner with a vibrator/fingers/etc) but the second half I think is true. He needs to eat OP out and get her there before they have PIV. If this just somehow never occurred to him and he's willing to do this, terrific.

However, I think since he just doesn't give a shit after all this time and being talked to on several occasions, and he's 28 not 19, I'm skeptical he ever will."
Then you shouldn't be in a relationship. Don't expect your girlfriend to be a mind reader. 
"Because that perfect partner who's completely unfettered by at least one wacko relative or some family dysfunction does not exist. Real life isn't like ""Ozzie and Harriet."""
"&gt; You're putting unfair expectations on him.

Things she expected of him:

*Help with the housework

*Spend time with her during the pregnancy

*Spend time with his baby

None of those are unfair. It is not unfair to expect your spouse to do their share of the housework and childcare. It is not unfair to expect your spouse to spend time with you and support you, especially during trying times.

&gt;Just let him be the kind of dad that he wants to be

You mean the kind that barely sees his kid and does very little to help out with them? *Really*?"

"&gt;Does he have to actively participate to not be a ""bigot""?

If the only reason he will not attend this wedding is because he is not comfortable with gay people getting married, then in my book that makes him a bigot.

He's allowed to have his opinions and you're allowed to accept them (or not).  But I think you'd be hardpressed to find someone who support gay rights and doesn't think your husband has at least a little bit of bigotry in him.  "
"Coworkers share a lot of info, just by the sheer amount of time they spend together.  If Ron complained and wasn't discrete, Chris would have built up a negative image and Chris will be protective of Ron.  Ron is the one you need to deal with.

"It sounds like at the very least he is emotionally unaware and not able to cope with difficult feelings so he shuts down when you have them. 

I once observed someone in a similar situation although in this case it was the father of a friend. He had extremely limited ability to cope with her when she was emotional and instead of trying to help he would either shut down and in some cases become aggressive with her and tell her to 'get over it' in a way that was very unhealthy. 

Anyway I don't really know where you go from here. Do you want to stay with him or do you feel that it isn't worth saving? If you do want to save it would he be open to therapy? "

"If you weren't home and she wanted to go somewhere would she go partying anyway? I mean if you got an after school job or spent a lot of time hanging out at a friends house? Or does she do it because she knows she has you to fall back on? If she goes out partying anyway call CPS on her. If she takes care of the baby if she doesn't have you as babysitter then maybe stop spending time at home, which sucks, but it sounds like a serious talk isn't going to sway someone as irresponsible as her. What's going to happen in a few years when you leave and there is no one to fall back on? Those kids will be devastated to lose the only solid dependable person in their lives, and your sister isn't going to suddenly step up and start doing the right thing. It's ridiculous that you've basically become a father at 15 without doing anything to put yourself in that position, and frankly I think your mother is incredibly negligent for not getting your sister on some sort of long term birth control after the first baby. I hope this doesn't come across as judging you, you are in a bad situation through no fault of your own, I'm mad at your mom and sister for putting you in this situation. You seem to be a really responsible person and I'm sorry you have to deal with all this."

That sounds more like denial than just ""I'm not gay"", if that makes sense?


It wasn't your question, but the ""I actually tried for each one"" relating to 50 women really caught my attention. Did you genuinely like all 50? It's just that wanting a relationship with 50 women sounds way too high. Did you genuinely like each one, or did you just want a girlfriend?


If you've done the same thing 50 times and it hasn't worked, you need to change what you're doing, rather than say you're just not compatible with most girls. There's a big difference between ""being apathetic"" and just giving up.


How would you describe yourself?"
"Please listen to this, OP. This is solid advice.

I know you are a very good person with a warm heart who is struggling. Your mom is actively harming you right now, and she is not going to raise your siblings well. You've got to get an education so you can get a good career and support yourself (and maybe help your siblings as well). You can't be skipping school to babysit. And also are you planning to never leave home until your youngest sibling is a teenager? You're going to stay home until you're 27 or so? That would be a horrendous mistake, right? So think about it. If you leave now, you're leaving your siblings in a bad situation, but the older they get, the more effed up by this they will be. Staying there for another 2-3 years to babysit doesn't fix things for them. It just sacrifices a couple of years of your life.

CPS needs to come into this situation while those kids are still cute and small. And you should probably go live with your dad, focus on school, and try to get into college. 

Sending you hugs and support from afar. You're in a rotten position due to no fault of your own, and you're a good sibling, but you can't raise your little siblings yourself, especially if you aren't even able to get good grades at school.  You've got to look at the big picture here of your entire life &amp; your siblings' lives, and this situation continuing as it is isnt' good for them or you (it's only good for your mom, and her interests should come far, far behind you &amp; your siblings')."
Lmao okay so let's say he never found out about it and instead dies in his sleep from a very preventable condition? He's being a dumbass.
"You shouldn't be this unaware that you have value and he's treating you like shit.

If you want to stay married, you two need marriage counseling. If he refuses you need to file for divorce -- and know that 1/2 of ALL of your assets are yours even if he is trying to hide them. Which is real asshole move."
"I'd be nervous that if OP and his wife left, that the guests would ravage the kitchen for dinner instead of taking the suggestion to go out to eat."
"He's just an asshole.  Period.  It doesn't help that you're a bit of a doormat, too.  You need to start putting him on blast and telling him his comments are inappropriate when he tries to humiliate you in front of your friends, or just in general.  He's not going to stop if you don't start standing up for yourself. "
"Have you talked to him about her possessiveness? 

What's his whole attitude about this issue?"
"Block everyone's numbers. Block Deedee's, your dad, stepmom, and step sisters. If anyone calls and starts yelling at you, calling you names, or telling how horrible you are, hang up and immediately block them.

As for the money, until you receive notice to appear in court, ignore her. Her friend is the one responsible for breaking their lease, and it's not on you to pay for it. 

Once you finish school and start making a bit more money, see if you can find yourself a good therapist. You need someone to talk to in order to sort out and fix all the issues years spent with these abusive assholes has caused."

"Karaoke places can make even good people sound pretty bad.  It might be better to record her during a ""practice"" at home and play it back to her.  That way there is also the added bonus of no public embarrassment. "
It's okay to feel silly but now you know what you have to do to stay safe-- call the police and protect yourself. Violence like this only escalates.
"First, I think you should call your mother out on this.  She has no crystal ball, she has no business calling this horrible prediction about you and Robert ""the truth"".  Tell her that you are marrying Robert and she has a choice between supporting you and not supporting you, but you expect her to either support that or get out of your lives.  Before, she has always given you her candid opinions about people, even if they were blunt.  But this time, her opinion was actually something horrible about *you*.  If she really feels that way about you, that you would throw over a good husband and father just because you got rich, then I don't see why you should want someone around you who thinks so poorly of you.

Second, I think you really should get the pre-nup.  I agree there's no point marrying Robert if you don't trust him, but even if you do trust him there's at least a small chance that something will happen in the future you don't expect.  I honestly don't think Robert is going to have a big problem with it.  And it costs relatively little to protect something that may be of tremendous value in the future.  You're a textbook case for the kind of person who *should* get a pre-nup.  "

I'd rather have some aunties crow over me for 6 months (that's like the maximum time possible before the next scandal breaks), than get get divorced and have the same consequence, or, worse, ruin my entire life.

And consider the possibility this asshat might be *using* your family background. One of my colleagues would brag:

"Yes, agreed. Definitely try to figure out what you both could do to make your wife could feel more secure in your relationship.

""Sisters, I appreciate you being worried about me and that I was gone during the night. But me being out didnt affect the time I spent with family, didnt expose the kids to anything, and was my choice as an adult.

He studied for months. He obviously put a lot of thought into it, and dismissing it as ""rash"" and ""idiotic"" is honestly pretty immature of you. He found something he liked. It differs from your opinions. That doesn't make him wrong. It just makes him different from you. And I am saying this as someone who is not, at all, religious. 


If religion is a deal breaker for you, then enforce it. Hiding things is a deal breaker for most people to begin with and he hid quite a bit from you. 

He is his own person. If he wants to do something, he has every right in the world to do so. If you don't agree with his choices, you have every right to leave.

Obviously he knew you were going to react badly. Your reaction to this seems to be to dismiss his feelings while accusing him of doing the same thing.  If communication is this bad, it's probably not a terrible thing to end this relationship. "
"I agree that people are completely allowed to express their desires.  But when, in the course of expressing their desires, they reveal things about themselves that their partners don't like, their partners aren't obligated to stay with them, either. "
"He hasn't responded because he's expecting you to stick around and clean up after him, just like you've always done.

Now you said you're breaking up...but you're still there, and he's waiting for you to calm down and let your lives get back to normal. 

My bet is that once you've moved out and are actually gone for a month or more, and he realises that you're *serious*, he'll chase after you with promises and proposals.

However...I am in no way surprised that your wife *has* resentment towards you.  From what I have gathered a bout the situation, your wife works full time while also paying your sister to be a live in nanny despite the fact that you do not have a job and have enough spare time to look after the children on your own PLUS the children are in daycare so they're not even there for half the day? Am I understanding that right??

Your wife basically pays for you and your sister to hang out at home, play video games and have deep conversations over cups of tea. Of course she's goin to have rssentment!

Firstly, you don't need you AND your sister raising the children- it's just throwing money away. You either need to get a job and let your sister be nanny or ask your sister to stop and you take on childcare full time. 

Regardless of what you choose, your sister needs to move out because she has become yours and your wife's ""go to"" which means you communicate with her rather than each other which isn't healthy. 

Take some steps to get your independence back and rely less on your sister then see where you and your wife are then. "

They've set the parameters. They'll kick you out of the house, ignore you in favour of their boyfriends and generally treat you badly.

I'd recommend being a fucking dickhead to both of them, particularly about their boyfriends. Give each boyfriend an insulting nickname and only call them that. If they have some weird feature (like an arse chin or they strongly resemble your cousin) focus on that. 
Sing off-key sappy romantic songs about their relationships. When 13F is with her boyfriend, walk through the room singing ""and they called it Puppy Looooove"". Keep saying that 16F boyfriend can't get it up. Just embrace your inner dickhead 100%.

"I have a mental illness (bipolar II) and a year ago I had an episode. It was totally out of control. I was having panic attacks for the first time, rapid cycling and manic episodes, and I was suicidal. I also had these obsessive paranoid thoughts that would attack me and not leave me alone. It lasted from the end of April until the end of August. I now am traumatized from that. But since I'm on meds that are working and I'm better, people can't understand that I have trauma. Every time I have too much energy or am sad, I'm terrified it's happening again. I totally can understand how you feel. I don't have a purpose for saying all this, only to say *I understand you*."
"Agreed. Can they live with you (rent free) while he studies?


You're going to be a grandparent, and you're going to love that accidental bundle of joy :)"
You seem to be much more concerned about him sharing with his dad than *what he was sharing.*  WTF is that about?  Who cares if he gets angry with you for finding out?  He's painting you to be a lunatic!

"No, but to describe having an eraser thrown at your head as ""traumatic"" should honestly seem excessive to any outside observer. 

At any rate, it's still not really reasonable for a 30-something adult to have held a grudge against a 9 year old for 20 years. As others have pointed out, this is something that should have been dealt with by the adults in OP's life at the time, so any blame should be assigned to them. It's valid for OP to resent this kid, but she should be capable of recognizing that it's not really healthy, and address it in an adult way."
"&gt; ""thats not a nice dress"" 

But it is a nice dress...for her.  "
It means they're using each other to satisfy emotional/relationship needs that should be satisfied by a significant other rather than a sibling. 
"Jesus, I'd break up with him. Someone who handles anger like a tantrum throwing three-year-old (screaming and throwing shit? really?) isn't someone I'd want to be in a relationship with. "
"""Taking away my social life"". What are you, 12? You're an adult. Take responsibility. You sacrificed these things. You didn't enforce boundaries. You let her preferences dominate yours.

If you have to compromise who you are, what you like, and forsake friends to be with someone, you are not compatible. Which is totally OK! 

I'm not going to read too much into your description of her as emotional manipulation, but you just need to find someone on your wavelength. Leave. It will be best for you and for her.

You can't stop this from affecting your relationship. She has incrementally changed you into something you don't like- a socially isolated homebody. You say you love her now, but your resentment will sour to hatred in time. And in the meantime you will lose months or years of time being miserable.

Eject immediately. Dating is about find someone who is compatible with you- not forcing yourself into some mold. This woman is not your type. And that's OK. You'll still have feelings for her for a while, but that's supposed to happen. Trust me, when you find some you are fundamentally compatible with, you'll wonder what took you so long to leave."
"Also, OP is risking her relationship with her daughter as well if nothing is done. This could very easily become a ""My Dad is racist and my Mom supported him instead of me"" situation if OP doesn't find a way to squash this. "
"Go no contact, move to the Orion nebula."
No it doesn't. Most kids who get into dirt biking do so around 7 or 8. 13 is a perfectly suitable age to be romping around on a low powered dirt-bike provided they can show they're responsible on it. 
"If you've already decided that you're not going to rat him out, why are making such a big deal out of this? 

Either you support him cheating on his wife, and stop with the whole pretending to be offended thing, or you go and tell his wife. 

He's a shitty friend for putting you in this position, but it's where you are. You don't get to take the moral high ground and be offended that you're being used as a cover to cheat on his wife while allowing yourself to be a cover. 

I don't know if you're married or dating someone, but personally I wouldn't stand for this behavior in a partner. Maybe this is just me, but I don't think I would be able to marry a guy that helps cover for his cheating best friend. "
This is sounding like a deal breaker. Lots of guys to choose from in med school.
"Your husband has your back against his parents even if he doesn't speak up.

Edit: Please consider that he has dealt with his mother for all of his life and has been hen-pecked into submission. Also please take care you don't do that to him yourself. He is utterly defeated and still has your back."
"If you're educated (aka wealthy enough to drop some cash) consider looking into a professional matchmaker. They'll take into account your personality, schedule, and inexperience and set you up on some blind dates. Even if you don't click with any of the guys, at least you're gaining experience in a controlled environment.

Also, please don't be offended by this suggestion, but maybe you could look into an escort service if you're uncomfortable with your inexperience. It could be a great way to learn the ins and outs of your body with minimal pressure. If you're not 100% comfortable with this, don't do it, because it has the potential to be really bad if you aren't on board with it."
"Per your edit, I think the way he yelled at you and the things he said is a big red flag. Like it's fine if he just thought it was a little wacky and said so, but it seems that he is genuinely upset over this. It's a 5 month relationship and you're already having your bf yell at you over something entirely unimportant. "
"I respect bisexual people when they say they can be monogamous partners. 

But I find it really naive when they say they don't understand why it's upsetting to their partners when they come out *ten years* into a relationship as if that doesn't call everything into question for their partner. She doesn't have to be homophobic to find your news a threat to your marriage.

You dumped this news onto her after a single therapy appointment without setting aside time to talk it out. It's one thing to open a relationship, but to announce the news that you're fundamentally interested in a kind of sex she absolutely can't provide you with and then dashing off to work is downright absurd and cruel. "
Quote this almost verbatim OP. I would thinks he's be much more receptive to this.
"Sure, by all means move into a new apartment... a nicer apartment paid for by your boyfriend. He should pay for the old apartment's rent for the duration of the lease, the full cost of moving all your stuff, and he should pay whatever extra the new apartment costs (the difference between the old apartment and new one) for the lifetime of the new apartment's lease. Or, he can just buy your current apartment from your landlords and become your new landlord!

Does this sound unreasonable to him? Well, that's what he's asking you to do, and what kind of a boyfriend would he be if he asked you to do things he wouldn't do himself?

I hope he can realize how ridiculous and illogical he is being. If not, you need to seriously reevaluate this relationship."
"And the *expense*, my God. I was in a wedding in April. Between the dress, hair/makeup, gift, taking a day off work, etc., I'm sure I spent somewhere north of $500. "

"yes, this is a great idea. He has to go back to work after his nap so instead of freaking out and demanding answers I will say that I have some concerns about how the app is working and want to make sure everything is ok for his 80 miler tomorrow. 

We'll see how he reacts..."
"&gt;My boyfriend doesn't like to touch people or something...how can I have a real relationship with someone like that??

You can't."
You don't know what particular effects she might be dealing with though. Some of them can continue LONG after the pregnancy (gestational diabetes can continue afterwards) and could be literally life changing
"Website could be a front for something more.. 
It's hard to believe she's making that much with a few pictures and a little bit of text "
"Here, let me break it down for you.

1. Here is where I will disagree with /u/TLTheDougler - your friends are not obligated to break ties with her. You two broke up. Not your friends with her. It's unreasonable on your part to expect other people to shun her just because you are no longer in a relationship with her. When I broke up with my ex, a lot of my friends still kept ties with her, despite knowing what she did to me. They have their own relationship with her, and that's awesome - for them. You don't have to be involved in either common activities or conversations involving her, since I am sure you have your own history with your friends.
2. You attach your value to her - what she says, what she thinks about you, how she is always with your friends. Stop it. Stop, stop - stop it right now. You are your own human - not dependent on anyone for your own happiness.
3. Like /u/readyforwine mentioned, start working on yourself. Get a new hobby, go to meetups and learn about new people, extend your friend/acquaintance circle.
4. It's only been a few months since the breakup, so it's reasonable to still feel hurt and betrayed. Surprise though - time heals all wounds, no matter how deep. Do not wallow in self-pity. Start learning new things, going on dates - your only mission is to make yourself a fucking kickass rockstar self."
You can't change someone who doesn't want to be changed.. 
"Not just japan but in Korea and China sleeping on the floor is no big deal. Koreans tend to have heated floors and sleeping on the floor is normal. But that's mainly because the floor is clean, since you're not supposed to walk with shoes inside the house.

OP's boyfriend probably sees sleeping in the closet as some sort of Harry potter type abuse. Maybe someone needs to knock some sense into him."
"My sister has an answer for everything, even if they're mostly wrong. She seems to think that all her single early 20s friends are going to want to hang out with her during and after her pregnancy, they'll keep partying and having fun late into the night. I have tried gently to tell her that doesn't happen: not when you're on a schedule to feed a baby at 1AM, 3AM, 6AM, and your life is ruled basically by an infant's needs and that baby has *no* idea what your schedule is. 

No matter what, if she goes ahead and has this baby, I'm going to love that child the best I can. It just seriously upsets me this happened at such a bad time. She isn't in a good place in life -- no stable job or housing or relationship -- where one or two major challenges would still be surmountable.

There's social assistance but I don't honestly see her using it. "
This is wonderful answer.
That may be partially cultural. In some cultures its more acceptable to fib a little to save face and maintain peace than be too blunt and cause strife. Still not ideal for OP but I would cut him some more slack than that.
"I agree with this as far as the 'leaving soon' aspect. Although her actions and issues are not your problem or cause it may be helpful to tell a white lie and leave out the liking someone else aspect as she may feel used as a rebound, just chalk it up to you leaving soon maybe as that is something that cannot be helped."
"I was in a LDR for 6 years, we were a train ride away. We visited each other frequently, with me visiting him about 85% of the time. He never came to pick me up from the station. Me being a cool, independent, non-needy girlfriend, of course COULD get to his place on my own, so I usually didn't say anything. Although, sometimes I would carry a lot of stuff so could use some help carrying it. Oh and you know, a little bit of ENTHUSIASM on his side wouldn't hurt, right? Well I started complaining about that after some time and he came to pick me up once. He then kept talking about it as if he climbed the Everest for me. For years that was ""but I came to pick you up that time!"" He just wasn't that much into me. I don't regret many things in life, but one thing I do regret is not breaking up with this guy a lot earlier than I did. 

EDIT: I guess the point of this story is: while one thing like planning dates or waiting for you at the station is probably a minor issue, it is a symptom of a very very fundamental thing. He.does.not.care.about.YOU."
Your boyfriend seem to be an asshole.
"Saying that stuff to mutual friend - regardless of relationship status - is supremely disrespectful. He has every right to be irate, you emasculated him to a mutual friend. You really don't think she told others? Obviously she did if she told BF. You trying to spin it as no big deal because it's when you were casual only makes it worse. The worst of all is comparing him to your past lovers (bad kisser). You couldn't say too many worse things. And you aren't even really sorry for it. You're only sorry you got caught. Guarantee he sees right through your fake apology.  If I was him, I'd have dumped you already. "
"I do not, for the life of my, understand where guys learned that faked proposals are funny. The *only* time it was funny was with Jim and Pam on The Office, because you knew that he had bought an engagement ring pretty much as soon as they started dating, and he was head over heels in love with her, and it was *TV*. 

Guys with commitment issues take note: your fake proposals will never, ever, ever be funny."
He said the reasons. He doesn't like her playing this game and this is his petty punishment 
" I don't let my husband borrow a lot of my stuff for similar reasons, he just doesn't take care of things. His own stuff gets trashed and broken and he doesn't take any better care of my stuff."
"You'd be surprised by that last part. As long as you're responsible and your kids are moderately well behaved, it's not impossible. 

But it just seems like...well, you sound like my mom. Well, she'd had a job for years and all, but she never went to college and seemed to think that she'd marry a guy and he'd provide for her. That didn't happen. You can still do better for yourself. "
"I agree with you. If her vagina or groin area is constantly inflamed it could create an environment for bacteria to grow. 

OP- The doctor who prescribes your UTI would be doing a culture and sensitivity rat before prescribing anything. You can call and find out if it was E. coli or something else. "
"I don't think it's rude at all. We always plate up the food for our guests, just for the fact that it is being a good host. Other times, i've pulled out dinner to thaw, for the four of us in my family. And a friend or two of our kids', ended up staying for dinner. I can't just pull out more meat to thaw. So i'll plate everything up equally, so we can all have enough. Most times, when it's just the four of us there's still plenty of leftovers anyways.

I think they are the ones being rude."
You're not being paranoid; this is weird.
"He wasn't jailed for ""ticking off a family member,"" he was jailed for committing a felony."
"This is the equivalent to the I'm pregnant ""joke"".  What an asshole!"
"My guess is that since, as you said, she doesn't exactly have a lot of wilderness experience, she doesn't appreciate the degree of danger. 

But she might also be thinking of this more as ""those idiots went off to hang out at a cabin and did shrooms and were dickheads to each other"" than ""one friend imperiled another friend."" So in her mind, you were high, he was high, and you both made dumb choices. Without knowing exactly the degree of danger you were in, it's probably easy for her to shrug this off as something that you and Tim will get over, and that you'll eventually be friends again. 

I'd try explaining one more time the degree to which he imperiled you, and be firm and clear that you cutting ties with him is a permanent end to the friendship, not a quarrel you're going to ""get over."""
"Seriously, the way to prove you are confident is not to follow any of his suggestions. If you do, it will be proof to him that you do lack confidence and self-esteem and are open to manipulation. It's rather obvious that he's interested in you after googling you and trying to get you to wear more revealing clothing. I would also consider locking down or deleted your social media that he knows."
"I have a 10 month old and if my husband behaved like this I would tell him to pack up and ship off. Your justifications for your behaviour are lame and transparent. ""You were spending time with your family so you couldn't possibly put dishes away where they go????"" You have got to be laughing. Anyone who says that's reasonable for you to do is homeless or lying. 


Child you have some serious growing up to do. Get counselling. Get a job and THEN be a parent because right now you are behaving like her second son and I'm embarrassed for you. "
"&gt; although she puts out signals so strong that others keep it going

your friends are grown-ass men who are capable of making their own big boy decisions, not remote control cars "
"Dan Savage has beat the ""all men watch porn and if they say they don't, they're lying!"" drum so loudly and for so long that a lot of people have bought into it. Like most blanket generalizations, it's just not true. A majority of men watch porn, but not everyone is into it. "
I doubt she is lying just to him. She probably tells nearly everyone in her life that her mother is deceased to avoid the stigma of having an addict mother. 
My husband has held out the carrot of finally moving to Australia like we talked about early in our marriage. ;)  I'm starting to think he agrees with you! 
"Agreed.


Surely some families have a mix of political stance, but saying ""I'm a Democrat so no Republicans are allowed at my wedding"" is insane."
"So removed because the smack on the head bit, I assume. Christ. Take it out and it's great advice. Tough love, don't take any bullshit advice."
Yeah they invested a lot of money in me. Guess what? I'll do the same for my own children. I don't think I should do that for the kids my parents want to adopt.
Yes it's their decision to make but she still considered the long term consequences of having her boyfriend in the wedding pictures is the point I was making. 
"Haha seriously, I had to double check the ages after reading the post. You guys are wayy too old for this. I can't even remember the last time I asked someone how many people they've slept with in the past, probably when I was like 20? "
"I have to wonder if she chose this specialty to some degree &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; she wouldn't be able to/have to take care of these family members who, as you say, have made their own bad choices. 

You &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; need to discuss your expectations with her before you take any serious steps together."
It's been **three years**. You're cutting them too much slack.

"In what twisted universe do you live in where a woman whose boyfriend **refuses** to get her off needs to *compromise??* He's the one who's got a position that needs to be budged, you twirling misogynist."
Tell your parents about your ex. Let them protect you when you break up with him. Hang around with friends. Don't be alone so he can't hurt you again. The way he acted with his phone sounds like he was cheating on you. 
"&gt;they found out accidentally

Seriously? You dont say how it happened, but that sounds unlikely.

Anyway, if you go home, their good intentions will smother you till you want to scream. This, I suspect, you know already.

I think just keep sweetly repeating: thank you, that is a good idea, but after a few bumps (thank you again) I think I am settled nicely here and I like it here.

Rinse and repeat."
"You have text messages of him belittling you and threatening you for being depressed. Not only would that help your case if he calls cps, but would help you get full custody if you left him."
"yeah his attitude irk me, he thought it was a good idea to date a teenager at 26 and proceeds to knock her up a year later. Sure she's an adult and should be responsible for birth control if that's whet they agreed upon, but there's a HUGE difference in maturity between 27 and 20."
"your concerns are probably valid but wanting to get married and having a date &gt;&gt; calling the wedding off is going backwards. Most relationships do not survive going even 1 step backwards, thats why it's so crucial to be sure moving forward."
Feels like it.
"It's quite possible it's another country - and in that case, there will be some varieties (though not as many as you'd think between at least European and US auto insurance). Insurance fraud also means a lot of different things in a lot of different countries, and even state-by-state. 

I wouldn't be super shocked if she was maybe minimizing. Having an airbag deploy on you/in your face absolutely sucks and most people walk away with bruises or burns at the very, very least. They save you major injury but it's not a soft pillow."
"Yeah.. Dump her. Like what the actual f***. Not only did she seem to not understand the fact that this was a professional situation, she also seems to think that being racist is ok. There's a possibility that leaving her could save your job (if it does you'll probably be in a situation where you don't meet with clients for a while anyway). Either way she should not be in your professional life."
"&gt; ""Control her splurging"" ummmm, that's not your job, OP?

Right? He seriously sounds like the old trope about wives spending their husband's money on useless stuff.

THIS IS NOT YOUR WIFE. THIS IS NOT YOUR MONEY. If you're uncomfortable dating a woman with expensive taste/hobbies (and she funds them herself), MOVE THE HELL ON. You don't get to ask her to remove them from her life."
"Sleep on your own couch then

"
&gt;She is the first of my peers to divorce, so I'm not sure what ""normal"" looks like when it comes to splitting up.

For future reference, it's ugly, and it's personal, and it's none of your business. "
This was my thought! She'd be way more offended that the entire pregnancy was kept a secret. There's just no way a 7 year old is gonna be oblivious and she shouldn't have to hear it from him. Or find out via a birth announcement.

"it seems like it's pretty important though. If you can't talk about it with your girlfriend, at least at first, could you talk about it with a therapist? "
"Until he owns up to what he did and accepts responsiblity for his actions and his upcoming child there's nothing you can do there. If it were me I'd cut him out until he does. 

And I know your friend did an awful thing by sleeping with your father behind your back, but that poor woman having a child with him as the father, she'll need all your support if you can help her. For all we know she was groomed, it may be worth talking to her about when you were teens, see if your father was ever inappropriate when you left the room etc. "
"This subreddit is very black and white when it comes to relationship problems. It's much easier to look at everything in an objective point of view and tell another person what should or what needs to be done, but relationships (or friendships) are much more complicated than that when you have a foundation and multiple layers of history between each other. Being involved with another human being generally requires some kind of emotion, which makes the situation a bit more complex when uncomfortable situations arise, but it's much more black and white for people when it comes to the internet because there's absolutely no emotion involved in the decision making process."
How is a firm hiring a person while she has a planned interview a lesson for her? There's nothing she could have done to prevent that. 
I'm happy you guys worked it out. Western Europe is fun and beautiful 
"No. Stop focusing on the stolen or lost part. That doesn't matter. Ignore it.


Focus on the *credit card fraud* part of it. You call them up and say, ""Someone used my card fraudulently at these two businesses.""  "
"""If they'll cheat with you, they'll cheat on you.""

You should probably stay far, far away from this girl. She's not a good person."
"So, your wife thinks you're in love with Emily and she was your ""second choice"" after Emily rejected you. Obviously that isn't *true* and you love your wife for herself and have no intentions of cheating and etc., but it sounds like that's what your wife believes. And of course she'd expect you to lie about something like that, so any reassurances you attempt will ring hollow. You ... might not actually be able to recover from this, if you can't convince her otherwise, and it'll be very hard to. 

Unfortunately opportunity for the obvious solution has already passed; if you *now* start telling stories about the previous vacation that are about all the other people and don't mention Emily, so as to imply that Emily is an unimportant part of the trip, she will assume (rightly) that you're avoiding the topic on purpose and (wrongly) that this implies you're hiding something. Your best bet, assuming you want this kind of insecurity in your life, is probably to start explicitly inviting your wife to do New Things with you, so that there's no opportunity for her to have bad feelings about what you might've done there before. ""Hey, there's a restaurant on the map that I've never been to, wanna go?"" ""Hey, I've always wanted to visit [landmark], you up for it?"", that kind of thing? "
"How often do you look at your sibling's wedding photos though? In my experience I've generally seen them once when they get the photos back and I occasionally see a few photos from the wedding they have up in their house. 

Breaking up hurts period, and if you spend your relationship hedging to spare yourself pain in the event of a possible future breakup, it's going to be much harder to grow a healthy relationship. "
"&gt; And don't worry too much about the CPS taking custody of the child - this is the last resort. Their first step is a serious talk about how to raise a child.

I worked for a church and we ended up having to call CPS on one of the teen moms because she just didn't know how to take care of a baby, and her family wasn't really solid enough to help her cope.

They were amazing.  They came in, evaluated the situation and gave her 100% clear instructions on how to care for her child and what she needed to do to keep it.  Feed 8x/day.  Change diapers within 15 minutes if soiled, etc.  Then they also gave her personal goals, like get her GED or get at least a part time job, while they helped make arrangements for child care.

In the end she couldn't meet the instructions and the baby was taken, but only after they went to all close family to see if anybody could keep it.  In the end it was a very compassionate process and she wasn't vilified, just given clear instructions and consequences."
"Agreed. Generally, I'm against the death penalty, but if i had the chance to watch the man who raped me be executed, I wouldn't hesitate. "
"Yeah when I read what she wrote about him, what he thinks, there are so many things in it that seem off. Like the sexism, and not accepting her stuff, and wanting to ruin it for her. Of course with her best intentions in mind! It should be sold, it's the best for the relationship and the future! I don't know. Reading this gives me stomach ache already. The way she described the car and its worth to her was clear to me when I read her post, and I don't even know her. I don't get what's so hard to accept about it. It's like the car is some power struggle trigger for him and I don't like what I read."
"Oh, cry me a river. (Your boss, not you.) He's a big boy and he can handle his employees getting sick and calling out once in a while. He can just go get over himself.

Quit and tell him why. Or hell, quit and *don't* tell him why. And you don't plan on using him as a reference, just don't even tell him you quit."
lol-she sounds like my daughter at 16.  it took a couple years of her being freezing to learn to dress properly.  
"Can confirm martial arts with good instructors is a great starting point. Been a taekwondo instructor working with students from toddlers all the way up to the elderly since I was a teenager and my own instructors are freakin amazing with this. We've had a lot of students with problems like this (to a lesser degree) who now swear by the magic of learning how to beat up anyone who assaults you as a way to get past fear of confrontation while maintaining respect for others. Some take a couple years to get to a good place, but I'd say it's definitely worth your while to bring it up with her if you can find a good school nearby that y'all can afford.

That said, if she doesn't want to change, all the martial arts and therapy in the world won't make her, and it's ultimately up to you to decide if and when to give up and move on. A wife who can't or won't make solid decisions will just leave you raising kids AND her."
I will get this information to you soon. 
He flat out raped her. She told him to stop and he didn't. Of course she should dump him!!
"This is what my boyfriend and I do for renting. He makes a LOT more than me, and he doesn't want to live in the places I can afford. Therefore, I pay what I would be paying if I was living alone, and he pays the difference. In the end, I'm living within my budget and he's actually getting a discount, because he would be living in this big fancy apartment with or without me. 

This form of money splitting seems entirely fair to me. The richer partners are the ones who want luxury, so they can pay the difference. Especially when it is a drop in the bucket for them. "

"it sounds like your ex is both an asshole and inexperienced with vagina since he obviously doesn't know what 'loose' means.

do you think it's likely that he just wanted to take your V-card then move on?"
"""Top men"" (wtf does that even mean?) doesn't include racists, at least not in my opinion.  If a ""good"" guy refuses to date a girl because she previously dated black men (and he has no problem with her previously dating white men) then he isn't really a good guy. "

Dude was a troll. He made a comment in French where it was very obvious that he didn't speak French at all.
at what point will you take personal responsibility?
"If you've never met this woman in 3 years; why do you think your gf would want a drug addicted nana to baby sit her kid? I actually don't know what you want. Do you want to stay with your gf? Do you want people to tell you that your choices are awesome? Coz for you, your choices are awesome. You go do you. But if you want an outside perspective then I have given you mine. You can circle back around and around 'but she didn't tell...but she's a child a of a broken home' OK- we've heard that: now what? Go find someone who's family is supposedly inline with your values. But dont act too surprised when you find that dirtiest skeletons are hidden in walk in closets."
"The friend is a guy and I really don't have any reason to not believe he would have moved to the other side of town, it's where his kids go to school. This makes me feel like an even bigger idiot because my husband unknowingly just killed his only excuse that would make sense. "
I have a 9 year old and I still would never leave her home alone. That alone would be enough to make me absolutely livid. It is so neglectful. 
"I don't think that's fair. It's their wedding, but that's no reason to be callous about other people's feelings. This could still be an incredibly sore spot for the aunt and uncle, and I think their feelings should be taken into account.

"He is wrapped so tight around his parents' fingers. Their opinions most definitely matter to him. We recently moved out of their house and into our own and they nearly had him convinced to not move after we had been planning to for months. I think they are a main reason he thinks that biological children are so important to him. He always cites ""passing on his DNA"" as one of the main reasons he wants to have his own kids. I have also caught them telling him adoption horror stories  one time. That didnt go over so well with me."
"No matter how much support he gives you, the baby will still be growing inside your body. It's not like he can say, ""Wow, your body is really taking a beating here. Let me put the fetus inside my belly for a few days to give you a break!"" If this is something you'd absolutely rather not do, I don't think there's any way you'd get through pregnancy without resenting him for having to do it."
Divorce sucks. You know what's worse? Staying married to someone like this.
"&gt;We agreed on no more kids

But it doesn't really sound like you have agreed on no more kids, seeing as he went and told his family you were continuing to try. 

I get that his family is important to him. But you and your children are also his family, and you guys should be the ones he is putting first now. 

I have no idea how you can work through this, because to me the only way it will work out is if he realizes that he should be concerned with his wife and children before he is concerned with pleasing his parents. And it doesn't look like that is what he is willing to do. I doubt he is even considering that your current children will likely get treated quite poorly by his family as it is, seeing as they apparently aren't ""good enough"" for them just because they happen to be girls. 

You might want to consider getting a tubal ligation if you feel this strongly about not getting pregnant again however.  "

"If it is easily affordable by you and most of your local peer group give that sort of ring then yeah sure she's being reasonable asking for it... and if you don't want to provide it she would be reasonable either declining the proposal or using her own money to buy it.

She's the one who will be fielding questions about ""why so small"" when friends and family see it. Why should she have to give *your* rationale to those people when she doesn't believe in your rationale? 

I mean let's say you needed a new car and you went out to buy one that is of the standard usual for your peer group which considering what the engagement ring standard is in your peer group a normal car for you would probably be $120,000. Imagine if she says  ""You're spending $120,000 of our household's money  and that is too much! Imagine what else we could have... we could have a nice holiday and I would enjoy it better! You can only spend $12,000. In fact I've gone out and bought you a $12,000 car and you will drive it because as a gift from me it has sentimental value and now you're stuck with it. All your friends who drive the $120,000 cars we can all afford and look at you like you must be going bankrupt... like you've got no self respect any more... they are wrong!""

"Your fiance doesn't need to feel less stressed. She's harming your family because someone who bent over backwards for her and helped her out *dared* not share her personal political beliefs.

If your fiance doesn't enjoy her wedding day, that's completely on her.

"I'm going to underscore something in this comment because most of the top replies around here seem to completely miss the most important advice that's needed in this situation:

**OP, the only correct thing to do in this situation is have your husband tell his ex-wife about the pregnancy directly, now, before she learns from her son or anybody else.**

Tell her now, ideally when she is alone at home or something, and allow her to have whatever emotional reaction she's going to have and process it first. Do not put her in the position of having to find out from someone else, *especially* her son, and have to deal with any awkwardness of such a moment. Your husband needs to call her at home ASAP and tell her. And he should add that he's of course going to tell the son and would like her thoughts on how to do so.  

Finally, I'll also reiterate the point that others have made regarding the ex's feelings with a story. When I separated from my now ex-wife, she frequently asked that I come to our old house and fix problems like leaking faucets. I did for a little while at first, because heck I care about her well being and still technically had ownership of the house at that point. But once the split was finalized and she took ownership, she called again to ask for help with something. I told her no, I would no longer be able to help with such things. She was livid, scared, lost as to what to do about it on her own. But, I explained that this was the choice she made (the divorce was mostly her desire and keeping the house was her choice). I could no longer take care of her. Eventually she learned how to take care of things herself or hire someone else to do them, and it never came up again.  

Your husband's ex chose to marry another man that didn't want kids. That is her life choice. If she wanted more kids so badly, she should not have married him and looked for someone else instead. You and your husband cannot and should not feel unable to rejoice in your new baby for fear of hurting her feelings. That doesn't mean you should be callous toward her, hence the advice above. But you cannot let ex's feelings hold hostage your need to appropriately communicate with his son about the coming change to the family, and to celebrate it."
"Yeah, sure, its not like pregnancy can be dangerous or childbirth can be fatal or anything!"
"&gt;OP can't cut off a buddy for doing that.

Yes, he can and he should. Do you know what the foundation for close friendships is, besides mutual interests? Trust.

Both platonic and romantic relationships require some degree of trust in order to work. OP's friend has already proved himself to be untrustworthy in romantic relationships. Why should OP believe he'll be trustworthy in non-romantic relationships, too? Cheating is disgusting and immature. There is no excuse for it. Ever. Either stay faithful or man up and end the relationship before moving on. People who cheat not only lose the privilege of trust and respect from their partner, but from their friends, too. Relationships don't exist in a vacuum and neither does cheating.

Obviously it's not for us to decide, but I for one hope that OP cuts ties with his friend, making it crystal clear exactly why he is, or at the very least keep him at arm's length from now on."

"Exactly! Who knows what life will bring?

"I'm going to go a bit against the grain here and advise that you do NOT send an apology letter OP. I think it's just best that you gracefully and humbly accept that your son does not want your or your husband involved in his life. You've reaped what you've sown and any letter or attempt at communication is more than likely unwanted. That, and I absolutely expect any communication on your part to be littered with excuses and manipulation and little to no genuine remorse or meaningful apology. 

Respect his wishes to remain no contact with you. You will only serve to hurt him and make what SHOULD be a happy and exciting time for him stressful and burdensome. 

Let it be. 

If he decides to ever reach out to you that decision should be prompted, manipulated, forced, coerced, or otherwise guilted by NO ONE. Instead he should make the decision that he feels is best and healthiest for himself and his family.

So, step back. Keep to yourself. Reflect on your mistakes. Live a better life. Let your son go."

"Actually, they likely would set you up for a sleep study first rather then sending you straight to a therapist--and psychological therapy might not even be recommended.

But when my fiancé stalls out at a red light because he can't drive stick and his reaction is just ""oops, this fancy of a car shouldn't do that""...I'm not exactly chomping at the bit to say, ""Sure, honey, take the car out tonight!""

Sound very unpleasant and unhealthy to me. It is fine if the other person is also anti-social and introverted, but for a lot of people, being unable to go out or have other important people in their lives isn't something they would be happy with.

Or, since this is what you want to hear  - you should tell her you love her, she's obviously in love with you too. Her boyfriend is a bastard and you should tell her so she knows, because she's unlikely to be able to make decisions for herself. You have put in enough kindness tokens and now she owes you a relationship. You have earned her and deserve to be given her as a prize. The boyfriend is a terrible person for going out with her, you're the best person for becoming her friend first, so you can properly manipulate her, you chode."
Well pregnancy is a big career hit too though since you have to stay out of work for a while to recover. You don't necessarily have to do that with adoption. Maybe she has something in 7 months that she doesn't want to miss. 
"He remembers what happened, he's just doing what all drunk cheaters do and pretending otherwise. If he admits that he remembers it means that he was cognizant enough to know what he was doing was wrong and that it didn't ""just happen,"" but instead he knew the situation was escalating and he took conscious steps to continue that escalation into cheating."
Yeah no seriously this is totes fucking adorbs.
"Perhaps we can be charitable and call him a ""cheaploader"" instead, if that feels more apt to you."
Of course she should... I don't think I implied otherwise?
"I was thinking Big May and Little May would get Sam to change her name rather quickly, but I love pettiness."

"Cold question, but what's his life expectancy?  What's the goal with marrying quickly before it happens? 

I have a chronic illness that inhibits my ability to work full hours. I refuse to get married until I know I can contribute my fair share so as not to make someone 'stuck' supporting me should it take a long time/forever. I know this isn't strictly comparable to a terminal illness but I feel the principle should be the same. Why would anyone want to tie someone in to a situation that will end poorly for them? "
Probably because leaving him means she'd be a single mother with a newborn and at least one other kid.
"UTI's can be caused by bacteria imbalance and or irritation, all of which could be caused by different things like changes in body pH or a foreign substance. 

I totally get what you're saying, but I think there's also allot of complex biology going on that we're just now beginning to understand. 

But there will always be hypochondriacs as well :/"
"You are not an idiot. You are supposed to trust the person you marry! Please don't beat up on yourself for trusting him. This is on him, not you.

Your therapist is right. You basically have to decide if you're up for the years of hard work it will take to move past this and rebuild your relationship and trust in him. But that also depends on whether he will admit he has some major problems and is prepared to face the long, difficult, painful work he'll have to do to resolve his issues and rebuild the relationship with you. Do you think he will? Or is he still in deflecting and minimizing mode?"
"Fiancé and I have discussed it and it was actually his suggestion to ask Reddit! Lol!

We're a but stumped. We've only included the people we love most in the world. It's difficult because I know they love me in that way but I'm just fond of them."
"Oh hi, me from ten years ago. I can tell you what happened to me.

I took him back. It was a one time thing (or in your case, a five time thing) and once the distance was closed  there wouldn't be a reason for him to cheat again, right?

He cheated on me a few months later. The last time I spoke to him, which was years ago, he confessed that he had cheated on every girl he dated after me. The problem wasn't the distance, the problem was him.

You just learned how your boyfriend solves problems. When he's lonely, he acts single and buys hotel rooms to cheat on you multiple times. When he faces unpleasant consequences if he tells you the truth, he lies to you.

Those are problems that he's going to have to solve in every relationship he has, including yours if you stay with him. He's going to solve them the same way."
"I don't think cuddling is bad. If it were just cuddling or hugging, that is one thing... but sleeping in the bed, honeymoon suites... it's pretty inbred."

"It honestly makes me so sad to see all these comments berating you for ""lying"" or ""tricking"" your girlfriend. People's sex drives can fluctuate over time, and that's perfectly normal and okay! What matters most is that you have an open + honest conversation with your girlfriend about what both of your expectations and feelings are about sex. Be honest about what you're feeling and check in with her about the impact it's having on her.

Obviously, you should be prepared for her to be hurt + upset. As humans (and esp. as women) we're often trained to feel that our partner's sex drive is more of a reflection on us than them. Try to emphasize that this doesn't mean that you don't find her attractive anymore or never want to have sex again. Talk about things that you can both do to make your sex life satisfying for both of you. There are also lots of ways to be physically intimate + affectionate that aren't sex! (Cuddling, massages, baths, etc.) See if there are ways that you can still express affection physically. 

All that being said, it's still totally possible that this might be a dealbreaker for her. That's totally reasonable and it's her prerogative to end a relationship that isn't working for her. Still, I would give her the benefit of the doubt and have a conversation about it, because being open and honest about what's going on with you is *way* less hurtful than just avoiding sex and letting her feel confused and ashamed about it."
"So budget $100 a month on ""sex expenses"", get two pills a month, and go at it. It's better than nothing."
I think she would still have been angry with you if everything had gone to plan. 
"I just imagined this and goodness no. I wouldn't want myself or anyone to be stuck in a life with all these cycles. Please put yourself first, OP. You don't deserve any of this and I think worse is to come if you stay. My dad was like this to my mom and it never got better. It only ended because my dad ended up getting physical with her and she called the cops."
"I've been battling through some pretty serious depression and anxiety. So I haven't exactly been the most sociable person lately. I'm spending most of my energy trying to get better...unfortunately I don't really have it in me to rebuild an entire friend group right now. It would pretty much mean I'd be all alone for a while.

NOPE. The time to speak up has passed. Not that his opinion matters...
"You can avoid a kiss without resorting to hitting the person... A simple duck out of the way, or putting your hand up to his mouth in a non slapping fashion.

"Let me get this straight... Your fiancé cried over the death of a serial killer? However, she is too closed minded to feel sympathy towards one of his victims. She wants no reminders of your cousin at the wedding.... Except the free dress alterations she did for the bridesmaid's dresses. 

Hasn't your cousin been through enough? "
Dang I wish the guy who stole my laptop felt this way.
"If she gets out of breath after two flights of stairs she is in desperate need of some form of exercise. I know several obese and mostly sedentary people for whom walking up some stairs is nothing. It might be enough for now for her to just get out and walk some (I think that is the reason the people I know are not totally out of shape, they are people who prefer to walk whenever something is in a reasonable walking distance). It wont burn many calories but it could be a huge improvement for her health."
"My husband has a shirt that I hate more then anything else in the world. It's ugly and terrible. 

Guess what? He still wears it because he loves it and he's a grown ass adult and can make shitty decisions if he wants to. Our compromise is that on date night/my family events, the shirt is never seen but around the house/his family/some errands, he can choose to wear it. 

Do I occasionally ""forget"" to wash it? Yes. Would I get rid of it without his permission? No because it isn't mine and that's bullshit. "
"I don't think there's anything strange about keeping a list regardless of age. Granted, it should definitely be kept tucked away a bit better than OPs girl. I don't know, I am a fan of the ""list"" for the sole reason that, heaven forbid, I found out someday that I had an STD or someone on that list informed me they had an STD, I would be able to pass on the ""go get fuckin tested"" memo with ease. Healths sake only, nothing weird about it. I keep one."
"OP, absolutely do this or you will have some extreme regrets later in life when you are trying to buy a car or home. Regardless of what he is saying, this guy is using you. Hard. 

He is a 30 year old man who committed fraud and is destroying your credit. You should be absolutely livid. You can scrape the dumpster and find a better boyfriend than this deadbeat, trashy loser. After this relationship ends, please work on your self esteem so that you aren't susceptible to this bullshit again. "

"&gt; I've known people who literally slept on ""nests"" of clothing and blankets on the floor for tonnes of reasons. 

I slept on an air mattress surrounded by blankies and plushies for at least three years, in my late teens. It was just really comfy, my bed had broken down and the interim solution became a long-term thing just sort of naturally. People can sleep however they like. "

"Has she ever listened to a recording of her singing? Singing and speaking are weird, we often sound entirely different to ourselves than we do to others because there are vibrations in our own head that we perceive and others don't. When I was little I used to think I sounded like a Disney Princess until my dad suggested that I record myself to ""practice"". It ended with me crying for *hours* but it was a valuable lesson.

I would gently suggest to her that she record herself so she can play it back and pinpoint where to make improvements. Frame it as something all musicians and singers do (which is true). If she's never heard a recording of herself before, this may be enough to squash the idea once and for all."
"&gt; His typical work week is 70ish hours and when they have **special projects he can end up working over 100 hours in a week.**

This is a health hazard. I have yet to see a person to survive 6 months of 100h work weeks without a burnout. Burnout can trigger underlying mental issues, like my friend who got a full blown catatonic panic disorder. 

60h is the absolute max for a workweek, and your husband will still gain at least 5-10kg of fat each year. 

I d suggest you put in the ultimatum, since your husband will be mentally ruined in 2-3 years. Then it takes up to 5 years to recover. "
"Fucking congrats, dude. Seriously. Toby is an absolute creep, his mother sounds awful (seriously, how do you come across a sketchbook full of basically underage porn that your son created and not care???), and your dad doesn't sound that helpful either. Glad you found a safe place to stay, and I hope stuff with your parents gets easier."
Yup. Sadly in some states there's practically no oversight and it's very easy for children to slip through the cracks. There's a small but powerful lobby that intends to keep it that way.
"He's your typical 'niceguy'. He's been your friend and so you owed it to him to let him be the first to sleep with you. Hence why he's so angry. 

He's not really your friend, and he's a horrible person. Fuck him. (but not in the way he wants.)"
"That first study is probably from my country (I can tell from the names of the authors). They are from a bilingual part of the country. A lot of kids are raised bilingual as both languages are taught in school, me included. And we don't have any learning delays, except for some people who are not good at languages, but I don't think that's due to being raised billingual. We can speak and write both perfectly. "
I would definitely be uncomfortable with this.
"I actually agree with this. If you want to live off other people don't be surprised when they cut you off for not following the rules, if you want to march to your own beat them you support yourself. It's not fair to say support me and support me while I do whatever I want, regardless of how you feel about it. 

If they had stipulated ""we'll pay for school but you have to go to church every Sunday and you aren't allowed to do any drugs, we will drug test you and we will confirm that you have been to church."" They get to say that, you can always walk away and do your own thing."
Are you that shallow?
"Op, you should probably answer this question."
"You are a pretty terrible person, it's not just a feeling.  You aren't just helping someone cheat, you're betraying your ""best friend.""  You will lose your best friend.  Stop justifying it with your relationship dwindling.  There's a good chance he's suspicious of you and his girlfriend and that's why.

If I were in your situation, I'd take a good long look at myself to try and figure out why I would betray my friend like that.
"
"Yes, contact his mother. Just say that you're worried about him and that you feel she should know he may be having suicidal thoughts. Show her a couple of his posts. That way he can't just deny it.

It sounds like he really needs help with his eating/self harm issues anyway even if it turns out he's not actively suicidal so his mom should definitely be informed. She may already be aware of some of it, but if it's got worse lately she needs to know."
"No offense, but how could you possibly know this was the first time? Unless it was physically impossible, you can't. For God's sake, look at the friends he keeps. You probably thought you were marrying one type of man and the evidence demonstrates that was not the case.

As for the ""if you divorce me I'll move into my mom's basement, give you all my money and give up my life"" promise- I'd be more than skeptical. 

It is a negotiating ploy. ""See how self-sacrificing I'd be? That's how sorry I am. That's how much I love you.""  Where was the love when he was balls deep in some rando? Sorry to be so graphic, but that's what happened in your marital bed. Marinate in that for a bit. Because if you stay, you'll have to deal with it forcing its way into your mind from time to time.

It sounds like he's trying to manipulate via excessive concessions. Even though he's an asshole, that would be too much to concede in a divorce. You need to soberly analyze the situation. You need to focus on the facts. I don't know if you work, but you need an assessment of where you are financially. In order to evaluate the pro's and con's of staying or leaving, you need to know what approximately each of those scenarios look like."

"I have a friend like that. He loves to talk about what we could do for vacations or other possible plans but the moment I go ""fine lets do it"" he retreats and shuts it down... I'm still friends with him but I've told him straigh up I'm not intrested in his bullshit talk and that he can just let me know if he has solid plans and he can keep the rest for himself. Then if he mentions going to a concert I will straigh up answer if I'm intrested but that he can let me know when he's buying tickets. Until tickets are bought and he is financially obligated to go I don't feed his imagination. I maybe had to remind him that few times and I still sometimes get cough up in his ""possible"" future but I've learned to live with it. He's just a friend so I can take it from time to time. 

Maybe OP should stop talking with him about marriage until there's a ring on her finger just straight up say ""you would have to porpose 1st"" and drop the topic. Aftere that still drop any planning until there's an actual date. This might be going for ever."
"He says he loves you but also goes ""You're so hot, and you know I love tiny Asian girls"" instead of naming a quality of yours he likes wtf???

"I don't think the initial guess that she was part of the group is all that racist.

If a white woman happened to walk in at the same time as 4 white kids, I'd likely assume she was with them. Even though she's older, kids often go to stores with some sort of chaperone, and it's typically going to be a family member of at least one of the kids. It's a reasonable assumption no matter the race.

Where he fucked up was in pressing further and not taking her word once she said she didn't know them."
"&gt; from what I saw of the two of them there were no romantic feelings, especially not on her side

not to be bitter, but that's what my boyfriend said about his coworker, and what I observed. He told me ""she and I don't even interact that way, we're purely professional, plus she has a boyfriend. I don't even think of her that way."" I saw them at an office party together and they barely talked to each other. Just seemed like work colleagues.  

I trusted him. 

He cheated on me and then married her. "

"And it's not like OP can't have sex at all with her fiance, they just can't have anal sex. So they need to stick to regular vaginal sex. Her fiance is acting like a spoiled brat."
"You've never really been out in the world and had to deal with adult responsibilities. You have no idea what kinds of pressures your wife is under and how stressful it is for her to be financially supporting 4 people, two of whom are adults, at the age of 28. Your contributions to the household sound minimal; it doesn't take 2 people's full time efforts to clean, shop, and wrangle kids who spend most of the day out of the house. You don't realize that because you've never had it any other way. You've always had the luxury of being taken care of by your parents and your spouse and your sister. You have the luxury of time to volunteer. From your wife's perspective, you've got it pretty easy. Her reaction to your depression is telling you a lot about how she feels and the resentment that apparently has been building up for a while. Asking for her support through your depression is asking her to do one more damn job when she's already working her ass off to support you while you live what sounds like a very easy life. "
"I completely agree. I am so bored of these comments on every thread that involves a dispute about having/not having kids. 

If you really think your partner could be that kind of person, maybe don't have sex with them? "
You are 100% correct. Your GF sounds very immature.
"If it's factual, how is it offensive?  You can call me a Slovak any time you like.  It's a fact, not an insult."

"Yep, I came here to say exactly this. "
"Here's a question...  Would you go *if* he apologized? Not for the 10 years of bullying, but for the shitty things he did as a 9 year old? As others have pointed out, there is an excellent chance he's not ""like that"" anymore. Can you move on? 

I'm reading your post here, and I think you need to do a ton of work on *you* as well, if you are still blaming him for you leaving school AND for your experience in middle school.

One of the reasons grade-skipping youngsters end up the target of bullying is because they are unable to read subtle social cues from their peers. The target keeps breaking small social norms, annoys everyone, and finally gets ""put in her place"" by a more aggressive child. And the other children are happy.

I'm a high school teacher myself, and a mother to a child who just blatantly ignored those social cues. I've seen this drama play out again and again.

And it seems like here you are screwing up again....  unwilling to give a second chance to an adult who was a shithead at nine, and even tossing out a good friendship because of it. "
Just to be fair here. The new guy isn't innocently being how he is. I'm sure he is a nice guy and all. But I can pretty much guarantee that he's trying to fuck you. 
"Yeah, that really speaks volumes..."
"I honestly think that your first talk to her went very wrong. Since, in my eyes, you never talked about what was REALLY important.

First, there is the issue that the most important thing is NOT to have more sex for the sake of more sex. The issue is that you feel REJECTED and unwanted. That the way she acts around sex makes you feel anxious and unsatisfactory. That the way the two of you act around is is stressful for you. Looking at your post you merely said: ""You know, more sex would be nice."" without ever addressing your core problems.

Another thing the two of you apparently did NOT talk about was her point of view. Why did SHE lose interest in sex? Is there something on her mind? It might very well be the case that she herself is afraid of it or not feeling good about it or that what she did in the beginning was ""honeymoon-phase behaviour"" and that she herself is not really into sex but did it for you. That she said that she does sex to ""meet your needs"" is a huge alarming flag in my eyes - it does not sound like she is particularly enjoying sex right now. At all.

Please, OP, sit down with her and have a SERIOUS conversation. In private. Say that her actions are seriously hurting you. At the same time, ask her how SHE feels about sex and if there is anything that happened that made her feel uncomfortable about it. Go into that discussion with an open mind and have her talk about how SHE sees sex and her recent behaviour. At the same time, make it clear to her how hurt you feel recently and that the current approach the two of you have is poisonous for you. Together, try to come up with a new and better way to deal with those kinds of situations. Something that fulfills the needs of the BOTH of you."
"OP This person is right. There probably is no in between on this. One of the relationships has to come to a close. Your going to have to pick your soon to be wife or your brother. Personally, I'd love to know which way you go. Please do an Update and keep us posted "
He didn't know she was married. He was single himself at that time. My bio mom never wears a ring. He stopped it when he learned about the marriage.
"This whole things makes me so angry and I find myself literally *hating* these awful people I don't even know. They are selfish, narcissistic, manipulative shit-holes. Who the fuck does that to any child, let alone their own?

She was 13 when he found out for fuck's sake! This was *his daughter* for *13 fucking years*. And overnight he disowns her and kicks her out of her home? That's his solution so *he* can stay...and take care of 'his' children....WTF!?  And then her siblings disown her and tell her she's 'not part of the family'?  And her fucking waste of a human excuse for a mother lets it all go down? Every one of those pieces of shit deserve *nothing* from OP. 

And now that they find out she actually has been welcomed into her bio-dad's family with loving, open arms - they throw a fucking shit-fit and try and guilt-trip her into saying she 'forgives them' so they can stay married. What the fuck?! Their 'apologies' and 'regrets' are nothing more than hollow manipulations. They *still* don't give a rat's ass about her - it's *all about them* and their miserable fucking lives. Absolute total human waste is what they are. 

As messed up as it is - they actually did her a favor by 'removing themselves' from her life. She's better off without them and is fortunate to have a real family that really loves her!

The only exception is the grandmother. She didn't turn her back on OP and she took care of her and loved her. Although I can kind of sympathize with her hurt feelings a little...I think maybe she's feeling threatened or something by OP calling her step-mom 'mom' and just doesn't know how to process it all.

I think she is wrong about OP crossing lines and for calling her mom and breaking OP's confidence about the relationship with her dad and family. Obviously, the grandmother is appropriately angry with her daughter and the shitty husband - but I think the anger towards OP is misplaced. Hopefully, she will realize this. 

Man, I just feel really bad for OP and what she's been through. No one deserves that; she's totally innocent and did nothing wrong. She deserves nothing but love and happiness going forward and I'm so happy she does have her dad, step-mom and siblings in her life now."
That is not what goes on there.
"It's his wedding - everyone behaves selfishly at their wedding and mostly they can get away with it and should be forgiven for it (if the rest of their behavior throughout your relationship is positive and thoughtful).

I don't mean to cry over spilled milk but the car should not have been rented.  Uber exists. But putting your foot down over shoes to go with a tux??? Nah man.

And yes definitely forgive him for ditching you guys after he got married to spend time with his wife. I swear, if he didn't we'd have his wife posting here about how she just married some scrub who ditched her to hang out with his friends at their hotel room."
"Despite the fact you think its unfair, and it may very well be, you cannot force someone to give you a second chance.

It sounds like she is going to be unavailable to you, and you need to find a way to cope with that fact. 

It sounds like you are holding onto a hope that is probably not there, and that is stopping you from moving on. "
"Jesus christ, how rich are y'all??"
"Completely inappropriate.  If this happened at the large software company I work at, and HR found out, he would be severely reprimanded, and probably fired if it ever happened again.

If the startup makes it and the company grows and he keeps at this shit, the company is going to get sued, possibly as a class-action.  If that does happen, you might make a bit of money out of the experience-- not that it's worth having to put up with it now, of course."

"It seems like you two are on the opposite extremes of normal.  FWIW:

It's not odd to simply buy a new tooth brush when it needs replacing.  Complaining about 5 spare ones taking up space is though.  

5 sets of dishes sounds normal and about a dishwasher full.  Might be on the low side depending on how big of a house you have.

1 ream of printer paper sounds perfectly normal.  Buy another when it gets low.  

I don't get your hurricane kits.  I understand having a supply of food/water/essentials, but why are you prepacking clothes?  It's not like hurricanes sneak up on you and if you need to evacuate it won't take long to pack.

Packing 5 sets of clothes for a 5 day trip is normal.  Worst case scenario is you wash underwear in the sink and rewear a shirt.  "

"GIRL!!! Stop listening to your husband on ALL health, mental health, food, or eating related topics. JUST STOP.

It's good that you are taking a break from your husband right now. You need to get your health back on track because you are on the verge of death. You need to get healthy BEFORE you even see him again.

Stay in the hospital. I'm SO happy you're in the hospital. And I'm SO happy that you're going to take anti-anxiety meds. 

ASK THE HOSPITAL FOR A SOCIAL WORKER. Ask for the social worker as soon as you can.

Ask your doctor what you eat and then eat EVERYTHING the doctor tells you to eat. You can POSSIBLY go back to eliminating things later. UNDER CAREFUL MEDICAL SUPERVISION. And let the psychiatrist tell you what to eliminate (later) and don't just go doing it by yourself willy nilly. Forget what a kinesiologist has said to you. The kinesiologist isn't qualified AT ALL do deal with your anxiety disorder.

You need to get yourself back from the verge of DEATH before you do anything else.

I have an anxiety disorder, and it's really, really, REALLY bad. I also have a diagnosis of PTSD. I tried all kinds of things over the years. I do not drink caffeine, that really helps. I tried eliminating sugar, that made no difference. I have never, NEVER EVER EVER, heard of eating chicken and broccoli only as a way to treat anxiety. That's insane. It is absolutely batshit insane. Don't listen to me. Listen to a team composed of a nutritionist and a psychiatrist and a therapist.

You need treatment for an eating disorder, YESTERDAY. I hope you are specifically in the hospital to be treated for an eating disorder. Whether it's anorexia nervosa, or it's orthorexia nervosa, you need treatment. ALSO, you need careful medical care for your anxiety disorder. And you DESERVE careful and proper care.

Do not meet up with your husband until you weigh at least 110 lbs!!!!!!"
Because they were married 2 years and she never told op. Huge red flag.
It's sort of funny how you think that she'll still want to marry you if you keep defending and justifying cheating this much.
Because it's a very small ceremony that OP is pretty much just doing because his wife wants. OP doesn't even want a ceremony. His friend can even come to the reception. I don't see the issue.

She just needs to understand that a theatre is no place for a baby. It isn't pleasant for other moviegoers or the people who bring the child. All you can do is try to explain your position again and refuse to go with the baby. This really shouldn't be a relationship threatening/straining situation.

Since you obviously don't have a conscience, let that act for one until you change your habits.  Regardless, leave her alone.  She deserves better than you.  Let her go because IT IS TOO LATE for her.  Maybe not too late for you though."

"&gt;He set it up so you got notification of the delivery, he discussed wedding plans with you, he offered a fancy box and said ""Will you...?"". He's been messing with you. I have no idea why, but he's messing with you and he's disrespectful. You shouldn't marry this guy. You should tell him he needs to move out of your place.

This answer is the truth.  He is a very cruel man.

I didnt even need to read the post to know this was the answer
"&gt; they have shared what they have done as well

So it sounds like your fiance and his friends were looking for mutual reassurances and understanding. It's not easy to abstain from sex, or to abstain from particular sex acts. Talk to your fiance about how *he* feels about your sexual activity, as he may feel less conflicted about it than you do.

Only you can figure out how to reconcile your (natural) desires and (natural) activities with your (human-run) religion. I believe that the most natural way to reconcile this conflict is to seek a personal path in your religion that doesn't accept all of the rules about sexual activity. It sounds like that's what most of your social circle is doing (because aren't oral and manual stimulation considered sodomy, and forbidden even for married couples?). You're doing things that you're ashamed of, so ashamed that it brings you pain to think that friends know of the sex you have (even though they likely do them, too). The only options are to reject the shame in some manner and accept your sex life for what it is, or to stop doing things that bring you this much grief.

Your fiance betrayed your trust, but it sounds like what's really bothering you is your own actions, and the sex you don't think you should be having. I think you need to figure that out for yourself and with your fiance, and once you do, you two can re-negotiate the kind of discretion you want to maintain."
"Congratulations on your engagement!

&gt;Due to my boney fingers however, it only just fits over my knuckle but it's loose enough to swing around my finger itself so the gem keeps going face down (oh well! - can't exactly get finger surgery lol)

"You know - you're catching some shit in this thread and being downvoted from what I've seen, but I think you ought to be (slightly) commended for the steps you're taking. I haven't met one person (save my sister) in my real life who has bought a self-help book/ been open to the idea of therapy after fucking up a relationship. I've most seen the ostrich-head-in-the-sand response. 

So good start and I hope you follow through. You've recognized you're pretty commitment phobic and you've gotten a self-help book (which is great), but that will only go so far. I do think therapy would help - so read the book and then start seeing a therapist. 

Btw, your commitment phobia might be related to your parents' divorce during your childhood. The fact that you're nervous about it might be a sign that there is something there that you need to address. 

Also, no, I don't think you should try to get back with Anna at this point. By having an issue with her idiosyncrasies, you've undoubtedly really hurt her. You used specific things about her as a person to get upset and push her away. You didn't take issue with the nature of relationships or the way your life has changed - but rather with things that are integral to *who Anna is.* That's got to really hurt. And since you are just at the beginning of the path of learning your lesson from this situation, you don't want to get her involved again just to hurt her again. Give yourself time. "
"I think you sound like a great wife. I personally would have been more comfortable in a hotel and often when we visit family I insist on it as I'm pretty introverted and my husband's family is huge. It sounds like your sister is having trouble sharing you with your husband for some reason. I would try and talk to her about this further so there are no hard feelings.

Also, regardless of how close a family is, when there are that many people crowded into a place it's not really comfortable for anyone let alone someone who has never met these people before."
"I'm really tired of the 'points for honesty' thing. Why are we giving out points for the bare minimum decent thing? Should I get points for having skin now? And some people, if they're honest about who they are turn out to be shitty people.

The only points he gets should be from a spear."

"Yeah, it's really the worst option that he could take for everyone. It's extremely hurtful for his wife. It's absolutely the wrong to handle things with Nicky. Really, it's completely unfair to spring a baby brother or sister on a seven-year-old without giving him time to get accustomed to the idea and then get excited about it. Hell, it's even the wrong way to handle his ex wife's feelings because how will she feel if none of them tell her about the baby until after he or she is born and she has to find out from some other source? 

Really, I don't see who benefits from this plan. Even OP's husband ultimately won't benefit from it. Sure, he gets to avoid conflict now, but it'll be worse for him in the long run too. Hopefully, he's just panicking over how to deal with a difficult ex-wife, and he'll come to his senses when he considers how this will actually play out. "
"The piercing hole is an open wound whether there's a piece of metal in it or not. 

Piercing holes heal up pretty quickly once you take out the metal because there's nothing stuck beneath the skin/moving around making it difficult for the body to close the wound. My piercings healed very quickly once I took them out, yet some of them refused to heal when the metal was still in my skin."
It's a party. I'm not sure if you've ever been to one but they're crowded and you can't expect much space. If he has to explain to everyone he touches what he's doing as he walks through a crowded room it'll take him all day. 
I'm not saying anyone involved in this is very smart.
He should take a picture of his friends wearing some of his girlfriends clothes and them laughing as they donate 2 or 3 into a bin.
I got the idea that he was more super on board with it.
"As far as I know, the family is the one tramiting her working visa right now. But again, I don't actually know her. All could be true or all could be lies for what I can tell of an almost-stranger to me 😕 last time I saw her dad *my cousin* we were both children. 

I know that idealy one should be able to just say ""No"". Unfortunately that does not apply for my culture, we are meant to bend over backwards for family. If I did that a shitstorm would fall upon me and my family I'm sure. I might break my mums relationship with her sister. Sounds terribly silly, I know. I'm just trying to find a way around it. I very much appreciate your input though :)  "
"You only know yourself. For me - cheating will always be a deal breaker. There is NO excuse good enough. Not that you were drunk - felt alone - extremely horny - NOT A ONE. You should however realize if you do try to come back from this, that means on top of the issues you had before you now have to rebuild trust in her which can take an awfully long time &amp; a lot of additional work.

Personally - drop her. But again - it is your choice, just like it was hers.

"Who wouldn't be annoyed by frequent proclamations of self-superiority? It's unsettling to be around someone who gives off the impression that they believe they poop lavender and sunshine. Furthermore, ""not actually hurting someone"" is a terribly low bar to clear when it comes to how you treat other human beings.

So yes, on one hand it's his own personal annoyance with it. But who knows what kind of affect her behavior is having on her social life? If she is truly unaware of the attitude that she projects, she's probably damaged friendships and professional relationships by now. It's in her best interest to at least be presented with an outside perspective on her behavior, even if she chooses to do nothing with that information."

"You have a boyfriend who puts a lot of effort into gift giving.  He comes up with new ideas.  He spends a lot of money.  You are dating a high performer in the gift-giving arena.  

From his perspective, recycling the romantic trip idea from one girlfriend to the next would have been tawdry and uninspired.  He wanted to do something new and unique for your birthday. If you two stay together long enough, he'll probably take you on a romantic trip for another birthday.  

It sounds like your root concern is that he liked the previous girlfriend more, or that she inspired him to greater heights.  You need to get that feeling under control because it is toxic to your relationship.  He's with you for a reason.  "
"What the fuck, OP? You're literally making so many assumptions left right and centre it's a little ridiculous. 

Look at it from the brother's point of view. He was abandoned by his birth mother, who CHOSE her first child and gave him up. He's feeling already sidelined. Then, although he had an adoptive family, they also abandoned him as soon as their legal responsibility was over. Sidelined yet again. He has no family. He's alone. He didn't get ANY control in his life over who chose him or who loves him. He probably feels unwanted and unfortunately that seems to be the case.

So he finds a sister he didn't even know he had. Or maybe he did know but never contacted you. At 19, when everyone around him is JUST starting to gain independence from his family, he wishes he had anyone in his corner at all. He's not expecting you to be his mom. But you are irrevocably tied to him. He is your brother, whether you acknowledge it or not, whether you stay in contact or not. You are not obligated to love him, but you are obligated to be aware that he IS different from a random stranger on the street.

You seem to like the way your life is. You don't want to mess anything up. For some reason this 19-year-old half-brother is a threat to your perfect little existence and so instead of even thinking about how hard his life has been, you want to bury your head in the sand and say ""but he's not really my brother because I never grew up with him.""

God, I feel so bad for this kid. Is it possible that he's a drug-addicted sociopath who wants your money and nothing else? Sure. You know what else is about a thousand times more likely? He's a scared, lonely kid who's just now realizing that there's nobody out there who loves him unconditionally the way a family's supposed to. So he's gone out to find the one person who maybe, maybe can provide him with some level of comfort since he never grew up with any of it, and then the person he's reached out to - which takes a hell of a lot of courage, by the way - that person doesn't even want to meet him because hey, he COULD POSSIBLY want to maybe come over for Thanksgiving sometimes and for some reason that's the end of the fucking world?

I just don't understand why you're so against having a relationship. If he turns out to be an awful person, then yes by all means cut off contact. If he turns out to be all right, but you guys maybe don't have that sibling bond, all right that's fine. Keep him at arm's length like your mother then. And if he turns out to really bond with you then you've gained a brother for life.

"Honestly, since he has no remorse about how this is affecting you or the people who he cheats on, you should just tell any new girlfriends that he gets that he's a serial cheater, and you'd appreciate it if she could make sure that people know not to accost you instead of him when he inevitably cheats on her.

"Abstinence until marriage is nothing like a fetishism and you can't compare the two together. It's like trying to compare a guilty pleasure for tequila with someone saying ""I don't drink at all"".

He did try to kill himself a couple years ago when I left him the first time. So he was at a hospital for a few days and they gave him medications and stuff. He doesn't take any now (he stopped taking any of the medications after they let him out of the hospital) and hasn't seen a doctor about his mental health since.
"I came here to say the same thing! 

Years and years ago I was engaged to a serial liar and cheater, and at one point, I discovered a profile he had made on an adult kind of hook-up site. When I confronted him with proof, he tried to explain it away as a joke and started forcing laughter. I kept asking him who the joke was with, I mean, you don't do something like that ""as a joke"" alone. I told him to keep in mind that whomever he named to me would be promptly asked about this ""joke"" before he had a chance to talk to them. He finally broke down and admitted that he intentionally made the profile and sent the messages. Then came the waterfall of apologies. 

There's no way this is a joke with the coworker. ""Oh hey, you know what would be funny, is if you made a couple of fake profiles on fetish subreddits and then, over the course of months, traded messages with random dudes making them think you're a female. Oh man, that's hilarious!"" 

The only context where this could possibly be a joke is in a situation where someone sets someone else up, usually a buddy or a sibling. I've heard of guys sometimes doing that to each other as a joke or hazing, but not this. "
"Seriously.... it might of been a feeling based on a fight that he put pen to paper so he could organise his thoughts better rather then reacting badly etc...

Journals/diaries can be very cathartic and help with focusing on positive emotions by writing out the bad and leaving them there.... don't over think things it really sounds more like the issue is with you and your insecurities.
You should try writing out your fears and worries in a journal and then see a therapist/counselor to help with them

If your genuinely concerned ask but the proof is in the pudding and if you guys have been great id seriously not worry... if you must ask have a general how are things chat between you both and ask if theres things he would like to work on together etc...

Sometimes we can be our own worst enemies and make big things out of something that wasnt issue to begin with...."

"I'd end the relationship on the spot. 

I make it very clear that I am monogamous, have no interest in three ways, and I do not forgive cheating.

"It _really_ depends on the field and the type of conference, and on OP's company. 

I went to Berlin last year with another colleague for a conference, and there's really very little expectation of 'networking' - we don't tend to hire outside of the UK and the attendees were mostly european, we weren't looking for clients and our industry typical doesn't work in a way that we'd get clients or work out of a conference, so there's little benefit beyond a personal one to meeting people in your field. People go to these conferences to learn about new ideas and new approaches and best practices for new technologies, there are dinners and evening events but it's very much a casual/party thing. The people attending these in my industry are typically 20- and 30- somethings in jeans and t-shirts (can you tell it's tech yet? :P ), they're like the least corporate events ever.

"&gt; It's like I'm violating some weird shocking taboo to say my mother was terrible.

I think it does feel taboo to many people so it makes sense that you would feel that way. I think people assume that there is some sort of eternal bond between children and their mothers (and vice versa), but it's just not true; relationships, even with family members, are built not inherent. But I think looking at that closer would be hard for many people, because we're all raised to believe we're in debt to our parents for giving us life, that the bond between us is like nothing else, and that no one will love us as much as your family loves you. It's everywhere, and people who have no reason to question it won't. "
"Oftentimes, there is no ""satisfactory"" reason why one person no longer wants to be in a relationship. We and our emotions change throughout our life--we're not in a constant state of being. And sometimes it's easier to identify the small things that make it impossible for us to continue--it's only later with the help of hindsight that we can see what the actual reason is. So the truth at the time of breakup is sometimes something just as ""bullshit"" sounding as ""the relationship is changing and it's no longer where I want to be"" because that's what that partner is able to identify and vocalize."

Honestly, the relationship with you and with his parents sounds pretty unhealthy for all involved.  He is acting like a child because he has never been forced to grow or mature. It is not your job as his gf or partner to force that growth.

You are not going to change him. You can accept that he is lazy and stay with him. You can stay with him and constantly be in conflict with his laziness. You can leave him for a better relationship. Those are your options."

STDs, pregnancy, and pain are all valid concerns, and you basically dismissed them by saying she could get over it by having sex with you. It really just seems like you saw an opportunity to get in her pants and took it. Quit pushing, and don't bring it up again. It sounded like she just wanted a shoulder to cry on, and clearly she did not want your peen. 


You think she is immature and stubborn? Just because she won't have sex? That's NOT being immature, and it's pretty shitty of you to call her that. Her biological clock is ticking?? Please. That is total bullshit. Maybe she is asexual, or maybe she needs to talk to a sex therapist. Either way, I think your offer was slightly inappropriate (although that depends on your relationship and how much you share with each other), but your pushiness and attitude after she said no is horrible. She's allowed to not want sex without having to list and debate all the reasons why she doesn't want to do it with you.

"So this exact same thing happened to me with my college roommate. We chatted dresses and plans for her bachelorette party and everything in between over lunch shortly after she got engaged. Then radio silence on anything wedding followed by pictures on Facebook of her and her bridesmaids dress shopping. It stung, but realistically I was way too busy to keep up with everything anyways (just finished my first year working as a registered nurse in a tough specialty while completing my BSN full time), I'm still thrilled for her, and can't wait to watch her get married in a few weeks, sans the stress of being in the bridal party. 

It would have been easy to be hurt (and at first I was), but given the choice to sulk (because I'm not about to make her wedding about me) or just do my thing and celebrate them when the time comes the choice seems fairly straight forward. 

Try not to take it personally, your friend still loves you. Buy a pretty dress, get dolled up, and enjoy the party as best you can! "
"I don't think it guarantees an unhappy marriage like the previous commenter said, but from a practical point of view, it's a bad idea to choose to be abstinent until marriage unless you have a religious/health/mental health reason for doing so. Sex is a huge part of most relationships and marrying someone that you're not sure you're sexually compatible with pretty risky.

Then again, if both partners are abstinent before marriage and they're not sexually compatible at all, their combined sexual inexperience might actually come in handy, since neither partner has the requisite experience to know that they're having terrible sex. So that's a silver lining, I guess."

You just gave two opposite statements. You can't tell him that you will consider him moving out while you aren't actually considering it.

You *can* be serious at 2 years but it sounds like they simply aren't yet. At 2 years, at their age, it's possible that's still entirely reasonable. Doesn't mean she thinks they will break up, just that she's not counting chickens.

I agree they need to talk though."
"Your story reminds me of what my first grade teacher used to tell us. She said something along the lines of ""hurting someone's feelings is like squeezing toothpaste out of the tube, you can't always get it back in."" That seems to be your case now. It seems like he has matured to the point where he could be a great boyfriend for SOMEONE, but because of your history that someone can't be YOU. I don't doubt that he has changed, but I do doubt that the wounds he has given you can ever fully heal.  

As a medical student and doctor you have a lot of late nights ahead of you solely studying and working, are you going to be able to trust him to go out alone? You are also going to be tired and emotionally drained at times, is he going to be angry if you won't sleep with him or pay him full attention? These are the kind of questions you need to ask yourself. 


From a fellow medical student, congrats on starting soon! "
"&gt; Can't use phone numbers that he would recognize. 

Why not? You aren't planning on continuing after this, right?"
"I know it's terrifying to leave, but it really is for the best. Your husband is causing you stress and anxiety. It might not be the only reason for your health issues, but it's definitely a factor. 

Lean on your family and friends. Tell them *everything*. Your husband is dangerous and you need then to know that so that they can help you be safe. 

You're stronger than you think. Please stay safe.  "

"&gt;I didn't react to what Nicole said

Actually you did react:

&gt;I was upset but didn't start a fight with her, just got my stuff and left.

Other people are giving tips on wedding etiquette, I'll just add that it is not a good idea to make a habit of silently walking away when you're upset about something. You need to learn to communicate your feelings in a calm rational way, without either losing your temper or walking off. "
"I didn't say it was a waste of time, I said so neither person wastes any more of their time. 

At 26 years old, and dating someone for two years, you should have a pretty good handle on whether or not you're compatible with the person you're dating. At 26, most people also have a pretty good idea on the major life decisions (if they want to get married, if they want to have kids, if they want to travel, etc.). If you're dating someone for two years who does not want to get married and does not want to have children, but you do want to get married and have children, what would be the point in continuing to date them? When you know that you're not compatible because you want vastly different things? Isn't that doing a disservice to both people since you could part ways and both people could find someone they're *actually* compatible with in the future?

Continuing to date someone after you find out they have totally different life goals than you would be the waste of time, but that certainly doesn't make the two years you spent with that person a waste of time. "
I'm not uneasy about her having a list. I'm uneasy about having *seen* the list and the names on it (which was entirely my fault). I don't think having a list is inherently a bad thing.
"I...oh my god, please reread what you just wrote. Who the hell thinks it is appropriate to open a serious conversation about breaking up so he can screw other people (and after that maybe someday he'll fall in love with you instead of just loving you! Someday! Maybe!) with a joke about having multiple wives?! Perhaps I'm jaded, but to me that sounds less like a joke and more like another push at your boundaries.

Please, get 100% out of this relationship (including permanently cutting off all contact with this man) and get into serious therapy. Your entire post is filled with instances of your boyfriend subjecting you to emotional abuse. Your core self has been worn down so far you have no grasp of appropriate relationship boundaries. 

(Edit: Added two words to clarify a point.)"
"Yeah, I know how old she is and I think I'd be a little weirded out if my boyfriend were into her. She's gone with that ""sexy baby"" vibe so she just comes off more like a child than other girls. I know my boyfriend is into celebrities younger than Ariana, but they all look and act like grown ups."
"Length and circumference are both factors. But I would say that in general, yes. If the whole penis can be hidden in your fist, it's a small one. "
she needs to be doing something to fix this part of her because that is too much pressure on you and eventually you're going to get sick of it.

"Does Karen's disability prevent her from doing household chores on a regular basis?

Honestly, I'm with Susan on this one and she's right...you're letting Karen walk all over you for the sake of trying to keep the peace.  In my mind, it's not that Susan is bringing tension to the household, but rather she is having a healthy response of anger to a roommate who expects others to maintain a perfect household while at the same breaks the very rules she enforces.  You even mentioned that other roommates have moved out because of Karen and that you are the ONLY ONE who has re-signed a lease with her in a five year span.  I can only imagine how many people she has lived with given that you mentioned that you both have cycled through several roommates in one year.  

I recommend working together to come-up with a cohesive household care and chores plan that fits everyone and write it down for everyone to see.  Is it juvenile?  Yes, in some ways, but it also sets a clear standard for everyone to follow.  And be ready to call out Karen.  Not for Susan, but for yourself.  Standing up to people is hard, but you owe it to yourself to recognize that you are also entitled to live comfortably in your own home without having to totally conform to the willy-nilly standards of someone else.  In addition, I think you also need to have a talk with Susan about the bikes.  That conversation should be between Susan and Karen.  Susan has every right to be upset, but she's also right that getting overly heated will likely not be helpful.  That being said, Susan really needs to figure out a way to talk to Karen about the bikes.  That is not your responsibility."
"No, your friends would see that you have a baby sibling on the way. Not everyone is as obsessed about sex as you think."
Thank you for saying that.  I went ahead and made an appointment with a therapist.
Tell her you don't want a sexless marriage and ask her if she'd be willing to first see a doctor to make sure nothing is wacky with her hormones and second some counseling.
Tell them to get the fuck out of your house.
"Her brother invited him, her brother can entertain him."
"Are you me? I had an ex who would get groups of people together and we would go bowling. It just so happened to be that more than half of the group were exs. I didn't even know they were until towards the end of the relationship. 

Everything made more sense once I found out."
"The thing is...there will always be creepers, from men ogling her to women talking shit obsessively. Not just online, but just from walking down the street. If she were to change her whole life to avoid these assholes, she'd be wearing a burka. And you know what? Even THAT wouldn't be enough, because then she'd have people walking the way she sways when she walks (real complaint). Stalkers in particular can arise from just about anyway, even when all the victim is doing is living their lives. 

Asking her to change her life and give up something she likes because there might be pervs watching her...why it is that a good excuse here but not in other places? When does she have to change her other hobbies? Her clothes? Her group of friends? 

The worst part of this ""excuse"" is that it infantilizes OP. Does her husband think she's, what, too stupid to know when she's in over her head? If the people who watch her become too much, she'll learn how to handle it or bow out if she decides its not worth it. There's plenty of women currently in the ""industry"" that OP could easily research and see what she's got waiting for her as her channel grows. 

This boils down to a problem with OP's husband. She can be sympathetic that he's coming from a place of concern, but that doesn't give him the right to demand she change her lifestyle and give up a hobby that make her happy all because he's afraid she'd getting some attention. It's not his fault he feels this way, but it is his responsibility to deal with it. He doesn't get to feel these feelings then dump them on OP.  "
"I disagree.  My mother was an aficionado of belt-whipping, but as she got older, would go years and years in between bouts of meanness and anger.  It seemed perfectly reasonable to assume she'd ""mellowed finally"" in her 50's, 60's, and 70's.  I didn't have kids but I don't think she ever took a hand to my sister's kids.  She has FINALLY mellowed in her 80's a bit.  I think it's perfectly reasonable for OP to have assumed his mother had mellowed.  "
"I'm sometimes alone with him. There's usually someone in the office right next door, though, so not really. It makes me nervous to be alone around him.

I'm not sure if there is an HR Department where I work. I think I'll talk to my supervisor like the other person says? I'm concerned she'll just tell him and he'll be mad. :("
