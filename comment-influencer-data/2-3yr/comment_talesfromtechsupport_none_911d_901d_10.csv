"Troubleshooting Windows that is localized to a language you don't understand is rough. However, what really messed me up once, was when it had Arabic on it. The 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons had traded places - because Arabic is read right to left. I wondered why the config I was trying to do hadn't taken hold - until I had a pretty epic headsmack moment."
"In case of family I tell them exactly that, or a literal ""Then stop asking me questions about it if you are not going to listen to my answer""

"This isn't uncommon. A friend of mine was doing some contract penetration testing and they wanted me to look over a contract the client sent.  
  
It was a mess. Some parts of the contract mentioned Yahoo. I asked my friend how Yahoo was involved and they had no idea.  
  
So I contacted the client myself for some clarification. They had copypasta'd Yahoo's Terms Of Service because they thought it 'looked good'."

"HOLY SHIT.  I have a similar story!

Background:  I am Korean.  I grew up in America, so English is my native language (if I try to speak Korean, it sounds exactly like an American who had to learn Korean late in life).  However, I kept my Korean name.

The first company I worked for, our emails were the standard firstname.lastname@company.com format.  Anyone who received an email from me would immediately know that I was Korean (or at the very least, Asian).

I was trying to get some information on a critical project, and it was fraught with delays.  Finally, we had an all-hands meeting...

CL - Crazy Lady.  Emailed back and forth with her but never spoke with her (or saw her prior to this meeting)  
Bossman - My boss who worked with both me and CL.  
Dongholio - Me  

Relevant:  At the time, we could dial each other's 5 digit extensions, and it would connect all the offices together.  We also had offices in India and Shanghai, doing a lot of the engineering work.  In the US, we had three buildings, Building A, B, and C.  I was in A, CL was in C...

At meeting:

&gt;Bossman:  CL, subs A B and C are delayed, I believe waiting for you.  
&gt;CL:  I tried calling Dongholio, but I had a real hard time understanding his accent, I can't work with him!  I don't know what he wants or needs, and he refuses to put his requests in writing!  
&gt;Me:  Excuse me, Miss?  We've never spoken on the phone.  
&gt;CL:  Who are you?  
&gt;Me:  Dongholio.  I've sent you numerous email requests before.  
&gt;CL:  (Stammering) Did you just arrive from the Shanghai office?  
&gt;Bossman (cutting me off):  Dongholio's been working in Building A for the past 3 months, next to my office.  Who have you been calling?

"Had many occasions where family/friends would ask for advice, yet go on to do stuff their way anyway, usually with less than stellar results.

Exhibit A: Mom received an email from ""Yahoo Support"" telling her account has been compromised, you need to reset your password, click here. Asked me if it's legit or not; told her that it isn't, don't click on anything, even at gunpoint. She clicked anyway, and reset her pass on that page. I immediately logged into her account from my laptop, changed her password to something long and difficult to remember, then monitored her account over the course of several days to make sure it didn't get hijacked.

I don't usually say ""I told you so..."", but... *sigh*"

"The same company sent me to a local university/hospital and I had to go get a photo ID card. It had the wrong name on it the whole time I was there, and no one actually looked at it when I did have it on me - it was just for show.

Chromebook can't get viruses? Is it because it runs on ChromeOS so no one bothers writing viruses for that OS?

"You might be on to something here....   My personal experience for when I try to cancel any of my subscription services, such as cellphone, satellite radio, internet, or cable TV, it becomes this long drawn out process of them sending to the 'retention department', where someone then tries to get me to continue, or at least get a alternative cheaper plan.     

So, based on this idea, we create a service for $199, our job is to call up the service, and tell them were cancelling service for Phone #xxx-yyy-zzzz, or whatever appropriate.   When the retention salesperson tries to renew the plan, we just ""Nope, Not now, Never, Don't want to, and Hell No"", until they give up"".   Make it so! "

She proceeds to tell him that she has batteries but refuses to test with them. So he starts from the top of the script, and works his way down. Twenty minutes later, he tells her they've fully trouble shot the control, except for the batteries. Again, she refuses.
