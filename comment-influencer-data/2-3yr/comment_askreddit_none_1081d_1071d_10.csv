You're a fucking dick. Most 'criminals' smoked a fucking plant.

Millennials can be annoying to all other generations because of their political correctness but their kids are going to be a great generation. I see it in my kid everyday.

Because they tailor your grading scheme to your skill. You can go into art school with zero foundation or knowledge of art and get by just fine. 
"They go by a script dude. The fights aren't real and everything they do is obviously choreographed. Even the conversations they have are scripted.

Yes, obviously those huge muscled up guys can beat me to a pulp. That would be a good point if it was actually relevant to anything I said. I didn't call their muscles fake, did I? No.

You can enjoy your scripted and choreographed 'fights' if that's what you like, but calling them 'wrestlers' when they are effectively actors going by a script who don't actually do any real wrestling is insulting to actual, non-scripted wrestling.

I actually have a friend who is a big fan of WWE too. The difference is he's fully aware that it's all staged and just enjoys it for the drama show it effectively is instead of trying to tell himself the fights are somehow real."
It's a transmission not a gun.
"Incredibly overrated, and the fact this is in this thread alongside the other films named means you should be ashamed for even naming it. 

This is the movie that people think is cool, when it's a decent ditty (it's mediocre). This is not comparable to say - scarface, the godfather, etc. Name *one* respect that this is better than the Godfather, go ahead."
Not at all. Coke is a party drug. You do it to go out and get a little kick and have some fun. 
As someone with a life i have stuff to do which is more important than perfect punctuality to please uptight assholes. 
You're right; its crap... stupid perversion of a great character. The British always do better with intelligent television. 
"Weed smokers are lazy degenerates. And the drug itself is a gateway to harder drugs. I hope this meme dies soon.

Edit: looks like i have upset some drug addicts"
"The real question is why bother treating them? They are only learning to avoid being detected as sociopaths. You don't actually make them safe to be around. As soon as they think they are no longer in danger of being detected or suffering some consequence, they will do whatever is entertaining, whether that is talk to you, have sex with you, or stab you to death and cook your remains and eat them.

Locking them away forever or putting them down is the only way to really ""treat"" the disease that sociopaths are in society.
"
"... if you're acquainted with someone before the date, especially enough to have a crush on them, the term is ""a date""."
"&gt; The key is bullet placement.

So it does have *some* issues, but you can get around it? Because if you're using an AKM, ""bullet placement"" isn't even in your vocabulary."

"Silly question, by why is it relevant to the story that you had a second teacher that teaches history and English? It's not a big deal, but it is a bit distracting."
What's obvious about it? 
"If more Americans traveled or at least ventured occasionally into trying other chocolates/food, they'd get to try the ""Real Deal.""

While it's tempting to blame America as a Ghettoland (my country is exceptional, my food is exceptional, my leader is exceptional, etc.), I think the real reason is not many people in America have the money to try better things of life.

Fondling father Jefferson would not have been a sybarite (he loved fine cheese) and owner of a fine library were it not for the toil of his slaves.

Bottom line, good chocolates=More money (and not many Americans have more money these days)."
*coeliac ... But yeah I can imagine that's annoying. I have Coeliac's disease and find people who feign it annoying 
I agree on trigger warnings but vehemently disagree on safe spaces. I am also a college student and in almost every implementation I have seen of a safe space it ends up killing free speech and creating an echo chamber. 
"&gt;nut house

that's pretty unnecessary. This isn't the 70's/One Flew, and we have a more nuanced understanding of illness now, beyond labeling the poor fucking people in there as ""nuts""

Edit: I'm bipolar. I'm offended and that's fine, but this kid beneath me is trying to speak on behalf of all of us "

R9 is multiple trilbillions better at football than Klose ever ever ever had a chance to be.
Well... do you not?
"I'm saying that I know poutine is good because I've had good poutine, but for everyone who hasn't had the chance you have to understand: nobody else thinks it's good, or that it sounds remotely good. 

In the US, if you want to put stuff on your fries you just use chili and cheese because it has so much more body and flavor than gravy while having enough body to be scoopable. Poutine seems like cheese that you decide to eat even though it's been in the fridge for a while and has gotten kind of off--why wouldn't you just use sharp cheddar, or a young white cheese if you can't live without the creaminess?

In South America they're eating salchipapa, getting their meatiness through a crunchy fried sausage or hot dog and adding garlic aioli or sometimes a green sauce for contrast. When see poutine they don't know why everything is so wet and flavorless.

In Europe (in general) they're having their fries with mayonnaise, aioli, peanut sauce, and spicy ketchup and wondering why our hemisphere bothers making french fries that cause an unholy mess instead of staggering around drunk with a paper cone of them.

I'm not trying to tell you poutine is bad, or that Canadians shouldn't eat and love it or treasure it as a national dish. I'm just saying this is one of those foods that very few other people get, or find at all appetizing the one time they dare order it. I get it, I'm a Southerner who loves grits and collard greens which most Yankees think are gross."

...ok? What makes you think I give a shit about what women in other countries think?
"...People's disagreements with feminists sound like Tumblrism at first, but actually make a lot of sense once you explain them properly?  Fine with me!"
"requiring writers, creators, and educators to make so much effort to spell out all the possible things in their content that so few people may find distressing is not worth it. the systems required to censor and rate movies and tv shows alone correctly without stifling creativity and freedom of speech are already complex, costly, and prone to damaging error. there is far too much variety in terms of type and magnitude of distressing topic for trigger warnings to ever be implemented effectively."
Hugh Mingus what?
"By that logic can we have men only gyms? 

Segregation does nothing helpful. It doesn't fix societal problems."
"I solve this problem by only tipping for what I feel is exceptional service.

I get that servers make their money from tips mostly, but that's not my problem. Fight for a real wage or get out of the industry. I'm not going to pay your wage because your employer doesn't want/have to."
Well at that point you brought that burden on yourself. Most women don't have a choice.
"*Omg, This is hilarious. I have never seen someone so insecure. Here's a fact buddy. Every single American down to stupidest red neck, is more valuable to the world than you. And that kills you. Your life is a train wreck. You have no friends, no girlfriend, no life prospects.

If only you were smart enough to be allowed in America.

Get back to me when Norway does anything significant in the history of the world. Most famous Norwegian of all time? Anders Brevik.*






This is how Americans respond if you take the piss, and I'd say he and many Americans seem to believe it.. Could you blame SAS?"
You are incorrect. The existence of other creepy and weird shit doesn't make this one any less creepy and weird. 
"I was gonna ask if animated cartoons counted as CP, I guess they do. That's fascinating and reassuring in equal measure. "
"Since when did gender stop being something that is determined by biology? When did the physical and mental differences between men and women stop determining someone's gender? Now apparently it means nothing because it's just whatever the person wants it to be and it can be changed at will. I mean I can identify as an elephant, but that doesn't make me an elephant.

As far as they would know better than me. Yeah. They probably would. They might not know better than a psychiatrist however. Often people suffering from mental illnesses don't realize that anything is wrong. For instance It's almost unheard of for someone to realize they have a personality disorder without a mental health professional picking up on it first and telling them.

I'm no expert, but living in denial about something as basic as ones gender sounds very unhealthy.

Fun fact: being gay is a choice now, because if you are a man attracted to men, but don't want to be gay all you have to do is decide you are a woman."
Guess she took care of it! Bada ba!

"Youre SURE hes against it? Do some research- he stated many times to be in favour of the trans people in the debate and personally invited kaitlyn jenner to his tower. Also, yes, calling trump 'stupid becuase hes stupid lolol im 14' is buzzwords. Also, what school did you go to, so I can make sure they avoid it"

Food is neither 'healthy' nor 'unhealthy'.
You're joking right? Philosophy and theology are just verbal diarrhea.
"For all the Gen Z redditors out there who don't even have to worry about their favourite celebrities dying coz most are generally under 50 and not even close to dying age. 

As a 16 yr old its funny to see all these people freaking out over the deaths of these celebrities. I literally cannot relate to any of the previous posts and don't give two fucks about Morgan Freeman or Tom Hanks or Mel Gibson or David Attenborough.

Probably gonna be downvoted by some old ass motherfuckrrs."

Or.... you could believe that but say that you are an atheist so you don't put false ideas in children's heads? So religion will disappear? So we can have a world that's a little better?
"I'm against organ donation. Though I wouldn't want to forbid it after real good education about this matter. This would be the greatest problem I have with it I guess - I don't think that right now we have education about this matter, just propaganda, at least this is my opinion.

I am consequent enough to refuse an organ if I would ever need one though before anyone wants to bash on my opinion :)"
"Yes, because correcting a spelling mistake is the best thing to do. Good for you"
"who gives a shit why tho? mb he just doesnt wanna be with some girl who got F'ed by her dad, you know? totally his right to have this preference."

"ummm.... what the fuck... Scrolled down a good bit, and didn't see any happy supporters of having children. I'm a product of 1983, and I have four rambunctious insane crazy happy children. Sometimes they drive me and my wife nuts... but that's just part of this thing we call life. Procreation is a part of life. Your FUCKING PHONE is NOT!!! My kids surprise me every. fucking. day. 
It's amazing. They're amazing. 
I started having kids young,.... and don't regret it one bit. 
My kids are the only thing, sometimes, that make me want to keep living. "
Not yet. That's why its too soon.
