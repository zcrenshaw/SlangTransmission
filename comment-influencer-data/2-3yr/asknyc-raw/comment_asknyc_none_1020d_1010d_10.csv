0,Thankful for not knowing you jerk offs in real life
1,"Sure, as long as you don't get off. But why don't you just stay at the airport. Easier, cheaper and more comfortable. Plus, easy access to restrooms, electrical outlets, food, etc. And then head out closer to your bus time. "
2,"The ceiling in our bathroom fell on my wife. The cause turned out to be a leak that they refused to fix. We had to use the toilet with an umbrella.

We had to go to the news and get a short segment filmed about our plight before the management company finally sent someone out; and that someone managed to take our towels out of the bathroom and put them directly onto a burning candle."
3,"If you have to ask, then they don't want to meet you. "
4,Int'l airports don't close.
5,Thankful for being able to afford to live in this godforsaken city....everywhere else sucks more. 
6,"&gt; I probably earn 40K per year

&gt; I am looking for a place in Manhattan, preferably in the West to East Village areas

Hahahahahaha!!!!!!!!

You're not going to live in the village earning 40k. You're going to live in some shithole in an ungentrified neighborhood in an outer borough or nj with roommates.

I work freelance too, and success is defined by your income. You're not successful making 40k. You're barely even starting out."
7,"Mine and my husband's go to is the Matador platter at Pio Pio.  A whole chicken, rice, beans, salchipapas (french fries with hot dogs), tostones, and avocado salad for $38 bucks.  Easily feeds 3-4 people. "
8,"I'm in the circus community and am part of an acrobatic duo (https://www.gigsalad.com/glen_and_jessalyn_acrobatic_duo_new_york) within your budget we could rent out a performance space, hire several performers (including my partner and I) and give you a show with as much or little audience involvement as you want and as much or little nudity/ridiculousness you would like. We could also bring in a chef to cook a great meal and serve drinks as well."
9,I'm thankful I didn't have to go to Penn yesterday
10,"Murray's Cheese Shop has a bunch of cheeses made in New York State, and some they age/finish in house. For a truly local flavor, I suggest [The Other Stephen](http://www.murrayscheese.com/the-other-stephen) - a Hudson Valley cheese washed in a Brooklyn brewery's (Other Half) stout."
11,Bed bugs!
12,"I'm an amateur home baker in Bushwick (I just won a national amateur baking award woo hoo) and Boston Cream Pie is one of my specialties (can send pictures if you'd like). If you trust an internet stranger not to poison your food, I'll bake you one for $25. "
13,They broke the machine or plan on breaking the machine and selling swipes to people who now cannot buy a metro card.
14,"At 40k even if you manage to get an apartment, you will not be able to pay for it and live comfortably, even if you're frugal. There's a reason the 40x requirement exists.

Get a roommate. "
15,"You're thinking of Sleep No More. Pricey but worth it.

Other strange things: 

There's an elevator museum in Queens. 

Take the 6 train past Brooklyn bridge stop and if you're lucky with timing, you can see the old beautiful city hall station that's now abandoned.

Roosevelt island has a really weird history. Take the tram for a great view.

Tatiana's in Brighton Beach is super fun for old timey Russian dinner and show girl stuff. Not too sexy, just entertainment.

PDT is a great cocktail bar hidden inside a hot dog shop in the East village.

16,Try the 1980s.
17,"1. Better connectivity to existing stations. The proposed station at 42nd street would be close enough to the east end on the 7 platform at Grand Central and the 55th street station would be almost next to the east end of 53rd Street/Lexington on the E/M. It would also put the SAS directly under the B/D platforms at Grand Street and F platforms at 2nd avenue. All of these transfers would be much longer if the SAS ran under 1st avenue instead.


2. There are existing tunnel segments under 2nd avenue, to be used in phase 2.


3. 2nd avenue is closer to more potential riders than 1st avenue. One of the bigger motivations for this is to pull riders away from the 4/5/6."
18,"Start at Olive Garden, then make your way to Guy's American Kitchen, and end the night over at Senor Frogs.  Guaranteed best night of your life.

Or, if you aren't quite that adventurous, a box at a Rangers game and a night over at Le Bain would be pretty solid too."
19,You do not want to stay overnight at Port Authority. 
20,The East River is lovely this time of year.  Consider a swim.
21,"Don't live in a room without an exterior window. First, its a serious fire hazard, and second, it's an illegal bedroom, and people who set up apartments with illegal bedrooms have been known to cut corners with fire safety in other areas. If you enjoy living more than dying in a fire, don't rent the DeKalb apartment."
22,"Because it's kitchsy garbage that costs basically nothing when purchased in bulk. That shit you just haggled down to 15 bucks? That cost him $1.17 including shipping. That and when you have a relationship with an international bulk shipper, certain less than legal opportunities arise."
23,No one should be renting in NYC without it. 
24,You... Can't imagine someone carrying a few dollars? You should ask for a raise in your allowance.
25,"They actually work kind of like gremlins. They start as a fluffy little cute thing, and then when they get hit with water they mutate into large men with carts and a plethora of cheap wares, screaming     

#UMMMMMMMMM BRELLAAAAAAA ^^UMBRELLAUMBRELLAUMBRELLA       

Generally though they're just people trying to make an extra buck and happen to be free during the day.   "
26,"This is it. They take a dozen scrap cards or pieces of paper and jam it in the slot so no cards can dispense, effectively breaking the machine. 

Commuters in a hurry will pay for a swipe but I'd fucking call the cops on them. This is one of the results of removing station agents from so many stations. "
27,"I don't know about your specific industry, but it is definitely not illegal to make someone work 7 days in a row. I've worked a month straight before. "
28,This sounds like the beginning of a rom com.
29,"You would be severely rent burdened if you were somehow approved. How would you be able to pay the rent on such a low salary?  At 40k, you definitely need roommates. "
30,"I was hunting for an apartment and ended up looking at one just west of Times Square. The building had been condemned, there was a notice on the door and everything, but the realtor insisted everything was fine. 

Suffice it to say i ended up somewhere else. "
31,"my health, food, shelter, enough money to get around the city and enjoy what it has to offer (food, museums, art/film/music).

and... enjoying a quiet morning in my ground-floor, street facing living room with nearly zero car or foot traffic this morning"
32,"Just hop the turnstile then or act wacky and walk right through. 

Business is business. You act wacky, they stop you, cops come, they lose.

You hop the turnstile, they complain, cops come, they lose.

They have theirs you have yours.  "
33,"A 1 br on the LES.  The bathtub was in the kitchen, a plastic curtain stapled to the wall.  The floors were uneven in every room, and the toilet was in the hallway, shared with the rest of the floor (or building I guess).

I looked at the place and passed, quickly."
34,"It's all perspective. I can't understand how people can live in the south. It's always hard for me to get my head around how non-NY'ers think it's ""so hard"" to live here. It's hard to live in Somalia, not NYC."
35,A poop. 
36,Economy candy
37,"Good luck with that.  They've spent their lives avoiding people like you, and they're pretty good at it. "
38,"Or spend $50 to access an airport lounge. Cheaper than a hotel and they feed you, booze you up, and you can take a shower or an uncomfortable nap."
