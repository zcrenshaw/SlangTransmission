0,I love not needing a car. I love going to a new restaurant every time I want to treat myself. I love how the people leave me alone at all the right times. I love the parks and the dogs and the children. I love the professional opportunities and the culture of art. I love the constant noise and motion. I love the diversity. 
1,"If I can't eat it while walking, it isn't fucking pizza."
2,It's not pizza; it's a casserole. It's not a meme; it's the truth. 
3,The Occulus looks pretty damn futuristic to me.
4,"As was mentioned in the article, it's a bit pathetic for visitors from other states, but I can understand foreigners eating at American chain restaurants they've heard about all their lives from movies or TV but have never had the opportunity to try - just like I wanted to try Nando's while in the UK. "
5,"I know we joke. 

But it just amazes me that people will pay a premium to eat at a chain here when they come visit. Like why goto a italian chain in the home of some of the best Italian food in the US

"
6,said no one ever
7,My stuff is here.
8,Since when has regional shittalking that's been going on for generations been coined a meme? 
9,"You can't tell me what to do, buddy. I pay my metrocard fare, I shit where I want"
10,"He's on the platform all the time, almost every day. I shouldn't have to put up with people with shit streaming down their legs, and it pisses me off that people think that should just be a standard part of life here."
11,"Hey I'm a Riverdalian! Let's get down to buisness. 

Riverdale is sort of a general word that comprises a series of neighborhoods between the Hudson River, Broadway, the Harlem River, and Westchester. In this zone, you have a bunch of different biomes from Mega-wealthy mansions with Hudson River views, Old Jews and young Jews in the center, Isrelis in the south, Russians and Irish in the North, and Hispanics in Kingsbride and Marble Hill (which is confusingly part of Manhattan and isolated and confusing so I won't talk about it much). All of these areas are pretty different, and I'm not sure what your budget or threshold for quiet and nice are, so I'll try to keep things general. Just remember that everything has an asterisk.

Transit. You mentioned not having a car and commuting near GCT...That's a bummer but not a dealbreaker. Having a car is pretty helpful in Riverdale because it allows you to run errands and such in Westchester. Here are your local transit options:

Metro North: I imagine this was your plan so it's here first. Riverdale has three nearby Metro North stops. The trains go to GCT. I think it's 6.50 off peak and I've never had a reliability issue. Trains are a little sparse on the weekends though.

Subway: You have the 1 train within walking distance of most of Riverdale and local busses that serve it pretty well. The 1 train is, by NYC subway standards, awesome sauce on rice (10/10). During rush hour it comes every 4 minutes (and that's slated to improve to 2.5 this summer) and that thing hauls ass late nights. It's 40 minutes to Penn station but you can get there a little faster by transferring to a 2/3 at 96th. You can also take a Bx7 to the A train at 207th. Since you're catching it at a terminal you'll get a seat. I personally don't recommend this, but some people swear by this.

Express Bus: You have the Bxm1, bxm2, bxm3 and bxm18, During rush hour, they're slower than the train but much more leisurely. On weekends, they don't come very often but they're like a discount cab. Quite nice. 

Biking. You're right next to the Hudson River greenway. You can get to the west side at a speed similar to the subway. Although shit's fucking hilly speaking of

Geography: Riverdale is a hilly motherfucker. Kingsbridge, where the 1 train is, is in a valley and there is a motherfucking cliff separating it from the white people on the plateau above. There are a lot of busses that go up and down that cliff, but that makes them wind around which slows them down. If you're young and impatient you'll get some toned thighs. You have pretty good access to parks. Van Cortlandt park is an underrated gem in this city. Huge, wooded, has lawns and playgrounds and a pool and wetlands and bike trails, and even some horses! Seton Park is pretty good for sports, Henry Hudson Park is a cool formal park with a giant monument to the dude. Riverdale Park is an awesome woodland. You also have Wave Hill which is a lovely little botanical garden. There are a bunch of trees everywhere which makes the air clean and the feel more rustic.

Shopping. There's objectively one good grocery store: Garden Gourmet. They deliver if you buy more than $75 worth. There are other stores that offer different things but...eh. You have some pretty good restaurants up the hill including an amazing deli (Liebman's). A bunch of new stores are opening up in new buildings along broadway. But I still don't really shop around there. There's a nearby Target that I'm not a huge fan of. 

Quietness: This varies pretty heavily. Most of Riverdale is very very quiet. Like the quietest part of the 4 boroughs. But the 1 train is elevated and Broadway in general can get quite loud below like 238th street. Some of the more quiet streets though are like dead silent. 

Crime: You're for the most part pretty safe. Up the hill is fine, but down it not as much. No part is super dangerous, but the area by Manhattan College isn't stellar. We've made the news a couple of times for our drug houses. There are also annoyingly regular car break ins. But I would still consider Riverdale fairly safe. 

Affordability: Nope. If you live up the hill, you're gonna be paying a lot for an area that has such poor transit access. You are pretty far from Manhattan and the pricetag does not reflect that. Kingsbridge is still pretty affordable and you're next to the train. The general prices of things aren't terrible. But this neighborhood by no means is a steal. It's been untouched by the blight of the 70s and it knows it. 

My advice to you is to come visit us sometime. Take the train here, walk around, grab a bite to eat and find a street where you can see yourself living on. I think it's worth considering.               "

oh boy are you in for a surprise"
13,"UrbanStems for flowers

It'd be kinda funny to use Postmates to deliver a Digiorno pizza. Because it would be both delivery and Digiorno. "
14,Fat white dude with a beard? I see that guy on an almost nightly basis. :(
15,"I don't rent so that one isn't an issue for me and I don't get moments of general suckitude living here. I get them when I leave NYC for too long, but not here.

I like being able to get drunk without ever having to worry about driving home."
16,"[Crest Hardware](http://www.cresthardwarenyc.com/), in Williamsburg (because Williamsburg still is a caricature of itself) has [Franklin the pig](https://www.instagram.com/franklinthepig/?hl=en). He's pretty awesome and hangs out in a pen in their garden section. I'd recommend visit Franklin over all other pigs because you'll pretty much have him to yourself. That's not to say he doesn't get a lot of attention - people love Franklin! It's just not a zoo. "
17,"Movies are not real. NYC is one of the safest cities in the US. 

Most teenagers do drugs, regardless of whether they're in NYC or the suburbs. In fact, there are some suburban areas that have a lot more underage drug use than NYC because there isn't anything else to do.

The bottom line is that there is not anywhere in the US where you can 100% ensure your kid doesn't do drugs."
18,"""do not go out unless is for walk"" doesn't sound like a fucking exhilarating existence to you?"
19,"Chicken pot pie has a crust, Is also called a pie, and is also not a pizza "
20,"There's a lot of opportunity here even though that makes it very competitive but I think I've grown a lot from it. There's a very real sense of ""sink or swim.""

I went to the west coast a few weeks ago and it was really nice. Sure it's great to be able to go for hikes in a redwood forest but you have to drive there. Go to a cool restaurant? Drive on the freeway to get to it. Go out for ice cream after? Back on the freeway we go!"
21,"You are welcome to go to any beach and dip your feet in. They're not fenced off or anything, just no lifeguard on duty. Water will be frigid, though. Have fun!"
22,"apparently a taser incident at penn caused mass panic

23,Sugar. They put sugar in the sauce.
24,We could try calling United Airways
25,"If you're making 75k USD+ in Stockholm now, I'm not sure you really want to make a move to a higher cost city for half that, and one that would be entirely foreign to you, unless you really want a career change. "
26,"Artichoke and two boots are fucking terrible. The UES is overrated, Coney Island sucks but it's close so fuck it. Crown heights and bed stuy are not up and coming, they just skipped right to the outrageous rents for white people stage of gentrification. SoBro will never be a thing. Rooftop bars generally suck, fuck uber while I'm at it. Bodegas that don't have cats, people that complain about service at a pizza place. Yelp, and anything with a wait.

Edit: things I like that everyone else hates. Mcsorelys, bushwick, the Bronx, yellow cabs, homeless people, low level street crime, my neighbors blasting music in the summer and arguing with strangers. Oh yea I also enjoy Times Square."
27,You're the only person not taking this seriously.
28,"NYC was practically made for forty something DINKs.

Source: was a 30 something DINK until K."
29,"The food; getting whatever I want when I want it compared to other places. That weird dessert you saw on TV? There's a place in Williamsburg that makes it. Mac and cheese dumplings? Yeah it's the special at Mimi Cheng's. That pastry my roommate would bring from home during college? There's a place in Brooklyn that makes only that pastry with different sweet and savory favors. 

Activities are endless. I want a comedy show, an opera, a sports game, museum, board game night, or themed party? Yeah it's here. 

Diversity. I'll be down south in a few weeks. They'll probably stare because my ethnicity isn't clear. I blend in here. 

Interesting people. You attract quite a bunch in this city. I won't even list the characters I've met, but I love it. I'd rather be a small fish in the sea than a big fish in a small pond. 

Most of the time, I just can't decide what I want because there are too many choices. But it's a problem I like to have. 
"
30,Call the CDC and report someone spreading biohazards.
31,"Euthanasia.

No, seriously, you can have someone come you your house and kill your pet. You have to have a good reason though. 

It's true, you can get anything delivered here. "
32,you made me laugh out loud. so you didn't do ANY research I see.
33,"Have you talked to anyone at the station about this? That seems like the logical first step. You can also try 311 to let them know about the issue, though that will probably be more homeless outreach and if the guy doesn't want to go anywhere I'm not sure what they can force him to do."
34,"It's just something that comes with living here.

Also, for your downstairs neighbor's sake, get a rug."
35,"Ignore the kids. Say what you want, use whatever language you want. If the parents dare to complain to you, just point out that *you are in a bar.* They really have no right to complain. 

I get where you're coming from, but you should also understand that daylight is fair game. Sunday is often the only chance people get to socialize. If you can't handle seeing small people, go out at night only. "
36,"Eventually the sun will run out of hydrogen and the exterior wall will collapse in on itself causing the fusion of helium to begin. When this happens the corona will puff up and extend outward, engulfing the earth entirely.

But no, someone will still inevitably be drunk and waiting for for a late night N train even then."
37,"This sums everything up. 
""People leaving me alone at all the right times""

That's also a great bonus.

Going to different restaurants when I like is my favorite."
38,"People aren't afraid to speak their mind or express themselves forwardly.

I fucking loathe the South's run around bullshit with conversations. I get that it's just the old timey, folksy politeness, Southern gentry etc etc but idk it skeeves me out and seems so disingenuous and phony. I'd rather you speak what's on your mind than giving me a fluffy filler sort of explanation that tip toes around things. Sometimes you don't want to have a 15 minute conversation when it's 8pm and you just want to get bread and eggs.

I also like how some people here aren't afraid to call someone a fucking asshole and argue with them when they see something fucked up.

I've gone out west and have seen many people barely blink a fucking eye if there's some pack of dudes reading bibles quotes and calling everyone every slur under the sun and being genuine assholes. Idk, I can't do the crunchier vibe.

39,"Double Income, No Kids."
40,"Gluten has zero to do with health if you aren't allergic/sensitive to it.

This is a stupid answer."
41,"I know who you're talking about.  I've already contacted 311 via the app multiple times.  It always ends with him refusing homeless outreach or requests are ignored.  Maybe if more people filed an official complaint, they'll deal with him like the spitting lady in the UES?

Either way, it doesn't seem like anything will happen until things get bad enough where the NYPD needs to be involved..."
42,By the technical definition that's exactly what a meme is - a piece of information or cultural knowledge that passes itself along over time.
43,"Also, what's your idea of ""breaking the bank"" and a budget? $50 per person is a lot different than $200 per person which is a lot different than $500 per person. "
44,I know more people who don't live here that give a shit than people who live here that do.
45,"Because deep dish is inedible, therefore by definition not food, therefore by definition not pizza."
46,"Upvoting because I hate going out for ""adult time"" with my wife and having little kids in the restaurant (when it's a bar, I hate it more). When our kids were young, it was kind of understood they weren't welcome some places because adults need to be able to unwind without worrying about saying or doing something an impressionable youth maybe shouldn't be present for. I felt even more strongly about this when our kids were younger because, why would I want to go to the trouble and expense of taking a break from my kids just to have yours three feet away? The current crop of parents letting their unsupervised children run around in clearly adult spaces need to grow up and understand that they need to take a break from these places for a few years or hire a babysitter. Oh yeah, and your kid's antics are cute to you because they're your kid. To the rest of us, they're just annoying."
