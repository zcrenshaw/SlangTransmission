1,My local liquor store started a rewards program.
2,Don't make someone else's norm yours. Born and raised in NYC and snorting some lines ain't cool. Stay away from that stuff. 30 year old male here and if I ran into a girl snorting coke who I was interested in... Guess what..... I'm no longer interested. I don't care how hot she is.
3,Thanks! That'll have to be good enough. Can't wait to have a real New York Slice.
4,"When I realized I hate this place, but couldn't live anywhere else. "
5,"Go to a temp agency and take some month long assignments on. Lots of them can lead to longer term jobs, but at the very least you will be getting some office experience so that you aren't sitting in the interview with zero next time. "
6,There's a subway line called the Q that serves the Upper East Side and since I discovered it I've shaved 200 minutes per week off of my commute. 
7,Uh if it was just the two of you and you don't really know each other then it's kind of a strange thing to do. Not something I would bust out as casually as a glass of water. 
8,"I met him over this past summer. I was sitting on a bench doing a crossword after work when he and a videographer friend approached me to do an interview. When I asked why me, they commented that I seemed interesting, and that I looked ""crisp and cool as a cucumber"" (was wearing a dress shirt and slacks), in 95 degree weather.

This really wasn't your typical HONY interview. They were doing it as part of a documentary/extended video interviews for an upcoming HONY project.

Initially Brandon started with some fairly basic questions about myself, and then things started to get quite personal. The interview carried on for the better part of an hour. His cameraman seemed particularly enthralled by the fact that ""the sunlight is hitting you perfectly"" and made me sit still while he took pictures from just about every angle after the video interview. (By this point I was sweating profusely from the sun beaming down on me.) 

Brandon has a very nice way about him, such that opening up to him seemed very natural. Having seen his work before, I had wondered how he got so many people to share deeply personal and intimate stories about themselves, and in that moment, I had my answer.

The following day, I ran into him again, this time canvassing my neighborhood on the UWS. I was on my way to the bakery, so I thought to get him and his associate some treats while I was there, and they were both very appreciative.

I learned a lot about myself in the time that I spoke with him. And I would encourage other people if given the opportunity to do the same.

A truly fine fellow, he is.
"
9,When I was born ðŸ˜Š
10,"Also, another thought I had: how many jobs are you applying for in a day? You mention not applying for other stuff while you were waiting on final word from someone.  Don't ever do that! You have to be applying until you get the final signed papers. Three years ago, when I was trying to move back to NYC in the middle of a fairly well laid career, I applied to at least six positions everyday for six or seven weeks and I didn't stop doing that because I had a promising interview. Hell, I had an offer and was waiting on conflicts check to clear and I was still applying. You gotta go HAM, no breaks. "
11,pio pio. peruvian food. for like $20 you get a sald with avocado and a lime vinaigrette. fries. and a whole chicken rotisseried in peruvian spices. ask for as much aji sauce as possible. its delicious and can easily feed 4.
12,"If you don't like it then you don't like it and that is the most important thing for you. I know a lot of people that have a casual habit (they'll do it when it's there) and like your said, have their shit together. But that's them. 

Really no reason to try coke if you haven't already

"
13,"Same thing we do every day Pinky, day drink, and try to take over the world.   "
14,"Went to 169Bar and discovered that you can text your drink (or anything) order. Was there with maybe 12 other people on a very crowded Friday night and our texted orders would be delivered to our table within minutes. Even stupid stuff like ""We need some straws"" was delivered promptly. How is this not a thing at every bar??"
15,"I realize I'm a New Yorker whenever I have to move and look at listings and shout out, ""the rent is too damn high!""

Also, when I travel outside of NYC and I'm looking for places to eat late at night and everything's closed. "
16,"What you're experiencing is exactly why people say that if you can make it in NYC, you can make it anywhere. 



NYC has a lot of competition so you need to stop comparing yourself to others, otherwise you will go insane. No matter where you are in career/life, there will always be people better and worse than you, but that's neither here or there. This makes no difference.

You also shouldn't expect too much with job interviews. There is no guarantee about anything. Don't put all of your eggs in one basket and stop focusing on each of the jobs. Your mentality should be to go on as many interviews as possible. If you go on 30 interviews then you will find someone who will give you a chance. This is a game of numbers so stop taking it personally. Can you take a couple of days off and schedule 4 interviews for each day?"
17,You're kidding.
18,"Prior to 1940 there were three subway systems, two or them private (IRT and BMT) and one run by the city (IND). Trains on the IRT were narrower, so trains from the BMT and IND could not run on those lines. Hence the new, consolidated system after 1940 was organized into two divisions, the A Division (former IRT lines) and the B Division (former BMT and IND lines). A Division trains are numbered, while B Division trains are lettered."
19,"Uh, no.... approaching a stranger, especially a homeless stranger, is not a brilliant move if you value your own safety. Watch the person for indications of their status, then if they seem like they need help call 311 and let them assess the situation and respond accordingly.

It's good to care but it's best left to professionals to approach and provide help to those who may be in need."
20,Lol
21,"10th Avenue in the 20s in Chelsea, the projects are on one side and a super high end private school is across the street.  HBO did a documentary about it recently called ""Class Divide.""  "
22,The day my parents took me home from the hospital in a taxi cab because we didn't have a car. I was 5 days old.
23,"* there's a homeless guy with a gangrenous foot who lives in the Canal St. subway station (the Q line)
* in the Financial District all you see now are Chinese tourists taking photos of themselves posing next to the testicles of the brass bull statue
* there are heavily armed police everywhere now
* weed is still technically illegal here but my delivery guy is fuckin great, god bless him
* Time Warner Cable is now called Spectrum but it still sucks and there's still no reasonable alternative"
24,"Parquet was considered fancy at the time it was built. It was the granite countertops of its era. Practical in a way (if it gets damaged you only need to replace a few small pieces), but overdone for the sake of it. "
25,Met him around 2012. I told him to start shooting RAW instead of JPEG and invest in computer backups. Hope he did that. Super nice guy. 
26,"Subways.  People in suits with briefcases, standing next to the sleeping homeless with all of their possessions in a garbage bag."
27,"It's bad news when it makes you uncomfortable. It sounds like it did, and that threshold is different for everyone. Personally I would not be okay with seeing someone snorting lines either, so I would be out of there. "
28,"My parents came in from Wisconsin and wanted to go to Katz's. We get there and obviously it's packed, and I go to grab a table for us to sit at.   This guy gets to the table a second after me and moves my wife's tray out of the way because ""he saw the table first."" Long story short, I get into a shouting match with the guy and my parents just kind of stare at me in silence until my mom says ""I guess they do things differently here.""  "
29,"Welcome to 3AM in a subway car with the mentally unstable. Next time, sit in the center car with the train operator. Less bum fights, and at least there's a chance the operator can call for help if needbe. 

Everyone saw, it's just that they know there's nothing they could have done. You're fooling yourself if you think you could have prevented it or brought justice to the offender. 

And for what it's worth, you should report it, if only for crime statistics purposes and the off-chance the cops recognize the perp."
30,"Unless you live in an owner occupied building, your landlord is not freaking out because they don't live in your building and so isn't a quality of life issue for them. It is however their problem, as city housing code [requires the landlord](http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/faq/525/who-must-pay-for-bed-bug-extermination-in-an-apartment) to address bed bug complaints and pay to remediate. You should report your landlord to 311 if they continue to bust your balls - unless they're an inveterate slumlord, that'll get their attention.  

Many landlords have contracts with exterminators to visit quarterly, though maybe yours doesn't. An exterminator visit costs about $500-$1000~~$100, a small enough amount that no landlord should be getting up your ass about~~. 

Edit: Standard vermin visits are $100; bedbug infestation treatments are more expensive.  While the landlord perhaps has a legitimate concern that there be an actual infestation, the law says that they can't make you pay for treatment.

Source: am landlord. "
31,Yes. It is a scam. Your neighbors are idiots. Why would your landlord ever need to see your gas bill?
32,"Some of them are subsidized through a city program to provide fresh fruit. Those ones are marked specifically.

33,The lights will flicker sometimes as the cars switch tracks and cut over from one third rail to the next.
34,"'I don't give a shit about being a New Yorker'!

[Can't pass up an opportunity to point out they are a New Yorker and others aren't]."
35,"I would argue that's more of a symbol of equality than it is inequality. The rich guy is still taking the subway just like the poorest.

"
36,"Most ""New Yorkers"" have a MetroCard."
37,"Port Authority Bus Terminal. 

Upper-middle class suburban bridge&amp;tunnel crowd shuffling as quickly as possible past the ragged and rank homeless."
38,Update: I found an employee in a different booth later in the day who transferred my balance to a new card in less than a minute 
39,"That one no longer exists, but there is one nearby in Times Square."
40,"My grandmother showed me.

We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait and the rats would come for the coconut and... they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you have trapped all the rats, but what do you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it and they begin to get hungry. And one by one... they start eating each other until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what? Do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees, but now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now, they only eat rat. You have changed their nature. The two survivors. This is what she made us. "
41,"Wash n fold isn't really expensive - in my first apartment where my building dryers barely worked, it ended up cheaper. 

How it works - you take your laundry, they weigh it and give you a ticket, you pick it up (or they deliver it) washed and folded. Whatever laundromat you are washing your clothes at now probably does it. 

If not, The local places tend to not be on the internet - just walk around till you find one. Any place you get through a website is generally more expensive. "
42,"Personally I'd double my usual tip, but still order. Expect it to take a little extra time."
43,"[Call 911 if they're in danger, or 311 if they're not.](http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1851/homeless-person-outreach-assistance)  The city will send a DHS Outreach team and/or ambulance as necessary, especially during a code blue.  

Welcome to New York."
44,"Also, A Division trains were built with an electrical relay that runs the entire length of the line, which is why those stations can give you time estimates as to the arrival of the next train, whereas B Division trains were built with an electrical relay that only goes to the adjacent stations, allowing them to only talk to stations two away from themselves, which is why the announcements you get are ""Downtown bound train is two stations away""."
45,The correct answer certainly does not involve Sex and the City in any way.
46,Because he's busting his ass to prevent us from having to move ours in the pursuit of food. 
47,Lol. This is not a blizzard.
