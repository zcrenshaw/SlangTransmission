This is an excellent example of how to ask a question."

2,"Some subway trains use tunnels, while others depend on bridges. You will **not** find an MTA subway train cross on: Hugh Carey/Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (carries 4 lanes of I-478 between southern Manhattan and west Brooklyn), *any* of the 5 tunnels spanning the Hudson (Holland, Lincoln, Downtown Hudson for PATH, Uptown Hudson for PATH, North River for Amtrak/NJT trains (+MTA *trains* for SW NY) + bridge (GWB), minor bridges on Harlem River (except for Broadway bridge, which carries the ""1"" train""), RFK/Triborough Bridge, Queensboro, Hell Gate (carries Amtrak), Bronx-Whitestone and Throgs Neck, and Verrazano-Narrows, Brooklyn Bridge, and Queens-Midtown Tunnel, as well as a small bridge spanning Jamaica Bay. 

Most of the tunnels are just as secure as the Lincoln and Holland Tunnel for cars, submerged in silt/terrain and a very dense shell of cement/rebar to support the tunnel's structure from the water pressure from outside. I'm not sure about the NY tunnels, but most of the cross-Hudson tunnels are close to 100 feet deep.

Note, the Brooklyn Bridge does **not** carry any subway trains. It *used* to carry elevated trains and streetcars (one lane for each - each way) and cars had one lane for each way, but was phased out in the 1950s, which now has the 6 (3 in/3 out) lanes for cars and a pedestrian bridge above. On the East River, the 4-5 trains crossing Manhattan-Brooklyn are carried by the Joralemon Street tunnel, slightly north of the Battery tunnel. The R train is carried slightly north by the Montague Street tunnel. The 2/3 trains are carried by the Clark Street tunnel , a spaced distance from the R train. A/C is carried by the Cranberry Street Tunnel. Skipping the Brooklyn Bridge, there's the Manhattan Bridge, which carries 4 subway lines (B/D/N/Q). The F train is slightly north, crossed by the Rutgers Street tunnel. North is the Williamsburg Bridge, which carries the JMZ train lines. The L train is crossed by the 14th street tunnel. Skipping the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and the East River Tunnels (carries Amtrak and LIRR), is the Steinway Ave tunnels, which carries 7 / 7 (Express). 53rd st tunnel carries E/M lines. Skip the Queensboro bridge (and sky tram), and there's the 60th street tunnels, which carries N/R/W lines.  The 63rd st tunnel carries the F line (and a future LIRR link to Grand Central). The Harlem River has the Lexington Ave Tunnel, which carries 4/5/6/6 (Express). 149th st tunnel carries the 2 line, and the Grand Concourse line carries the B/D trains. The Broadway bridge carries the 1 line (lift bridge). The last one is the North Channel/Beach Channel bridges, which carries the A/S lines.

As for trains going underground/above prior to going to a tunnel/bridge, it depends on the infrastructure. Most of the East River subway tunnels remain underground, and their respective trains continue underground until (some of them) are required to go elevated. Others, such as those which are carried by the Williamsburg/Manhattan are over the bridge (and you can see natural light), which means the train rises when its leaving Manhattan, and remains elevated (J/M/Z) or gradually returns underground (Brooklyn). The Broadway bridge for the 1 train is a lift bridge, which means that the bridge (and the traffic of US HWY 9/Broadway) has to rise if a ship/barge passes by, and the Broadway bridge keeps the 1 train elevated (where by upper Manhattan, it's raised above the streets).

PS: Amtrak uses the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge to go north to Albany (Empire Connection), which is a 1 track swing bridge, and when there's a boat to be expected (Circle Line will use this frequently again in the summer for their cross city tour), the bridge swivels, which unfortunately delays a train. The Park Ave lift bridge carries 4 Metro-North tracks (in a grander sense) up north to NY or Connecticut, nearby the Lexington Ave tunnel for the 4/5/6/6 (Express) trains. 

That's just about it! Unless in the future, NYC is crisscrossed by more tunnels, or MTA *subways* expands into NJ.

**TL-DR**: 10 tunnels cross the East River for underground subways, 3 tunnels for the Harlem River, 2 bridges for the East River, 1 bridge for the Harlem River, and 2 for Jamaica Bay. Most of the tunnels stick the trains underground before and after crossing (you might feel a decline/ascending), while save for one bridge, the other bridges stick with the overland route (since the rest of their routes are elevated)."
3,usually after a date i take over and operate the train. that way yr date won't have to make a transfer you just reroute it along their line. just learn which lines carry which stock and you'll be fine.
4,"""If it's real late, call her an Uber.""  Probably the best answer next to saying goodbye at her station.  Its very NYC chivalry.

5,"In my experience, we always went our separate ways unless someone was sleeping over. "
6,"Go home, take all your shit and move it into one room of your house. Now live in it for a month. Do you like that? Good. You can manage living in NYC. 

Ok, realistically. Run the numbers. What are your careers? Figure out what your income might be. Rent will be $2500-$4000 depending on where you want to live. You really won't need a car, but you'll both need monthly metrocards ($116.50/each). Your child will get a school metrocard free from the school that will allow 3 trips per weekday while school is in session, so plan for another $40 a month for weekend usage. We have an additional city tax that's about equivalent to our state tax rate. Some food is more expensive, some is cheaper, again depending on neighborhood. You won't have a big overstocked pantry, you'll likely buy enough for two or three days, so you'll be eating fresher and healthier food most likely. 

I made the move when my kids were around that age, and we don't regret it. Many of our schools are excellent, and your child will grow up with a deep appreciation of people from other backgrounds. S/he will also develop independence and problem-solving skills kids in sheltered suburban environments don't get. Not to mention growing up with regular visits to world-class museums and opportunities to do fun things like go to movie premieres, book signings, and other events that don't happen in small towns. 

So, yeah. Go for it. "

10,"I would strongly consider Long Island City for a year, and then re-assess once you have a better idea of the city.

Advantages of LIC are:

1.  Incredibly easy commute to midtown east
2.  Almost all new, luxury buildings with leasing offices (so you don't have to deal with a typical broker and uncertainty of broker fee)
3.  It's basically nothing but restaurants, human daycare centers, and doggy daycare centers
4.  Leasing-office/Luxury buildings make pets much easier. There's no ""case by case""  basis that you'll have to deal with from private landlords
5.  Parking (if you have a car) is less expensive than in Manhattan or Brownstone Brooklyn
6.  You can get a big 1BR or 2BR in a luxury building with amenities (gym, in-unit laundry) well within your budget.

11,Hi I want a pony. 
12,"3rd Ave and 23rd street. 

* Vintage Thrift towards 22nd and 3rd.
* Housing works on the north west side of 23rd.
* Goodwill on the south east side of 23rd. Down a little.  
* Salvation army just west of good will. Closer to 23rd and 3rd. "
13,"Meet wherever the date is happening. I usually go inside and shoot them a text that I'm there, grab a drink etc. 

After the date I guess you can walk them to their train station and say goodbye there. I usually just walk with them until we're going to be heading in different directions and then hug/kiss/say goodbye/etc. "
14,"Go to the DMV, grab a ticket and take a nap. When you wake up, offer to sell your ticket if someone really doesn't wanna wait.

16,"Hey! Emergency Management person here. I'm glad you're asking.

I'd start by figuring out what hazards you may face. It can depend on where you live. For example, if you lived in midtown or near a tourist/large gathering area, you may have to account for a terrorist attack or active shooter more than if you live in Staten Island. Also, check your flood zone, and your house/building info to see if events like that will affect you. Do you have pets or kids? It's hard to tell you what to do, when it can depend on your situation.

General good things include copies of important docs (put them all on a flash drive), medication, Emergency contacts, some energy bars, a bottle of water or two, some toiletries, flashlight, hand crank radio, chargers, spare keys, maps, pet care items (leash, food), toy for kids, etc.

Check out NYCEM, fema, red Cross, ready.government websites for lots of lists. But most importantly, figure out what would most affect you."
17,"Yes, please report in detail number of locks, what kind, and hours  your apartment is typically empty."
18,"Guys, this post is definitely not threatening, harassing or inciting violence. "
19,Just remember that you can go around the corner for some authentic Australian cuisine at the Outback Steakhouse.
20,"If you live somewhat in the same area or are meeting near where she lives, then go ahead and walk her home.   (However, some women may not want someone they just met knowing where they live.)

However, in NYC that can add two hours onto your commute home if you don't live nearby, so walking them to their subway and waiting a bit if the train is going to be 20 minutes is a nice gesture.

If it is super late and you really want to be sweet, you can call her an Uber.
