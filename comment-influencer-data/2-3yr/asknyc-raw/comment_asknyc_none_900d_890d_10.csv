0,"In crowded areas, they can see above the crowd and are much more mobile than other types of police. They are also highly visible to pedestrians which car/foot patrol are not in crowded areas. They can go places cars cannot go, such as patrolling inside parks. They are also effective at crowd control. 

In tourist areas, they project a positive, approachable image for the NYPD and interest the public greatly. 

For on example, a mounted officer thwarted a bomb in Times Square in 2010. "
1,I wish they were just more spatially aware. 
2,"Depending on the person and their vibe, some of my go-tos are:

- Roosevelt Island Tram

- taking the east river ferry down to Brooklyn bridge park walking around and then grabbing food (shake shack, domo taco w/e) and ending at the brooklyn heights promenade around sunset 

- getting day drunk on canned cider at sheep Meadow and then walking down through Central Park 

- going to some inventive but overpriced restaurant in Williamsburg and then walking it off on the Williamsburg bridge and then getting a drink at Mud coffee or wherever once we cross over 

- walking down the highline, getting off to check out the various art galleries if there's anything good on, and then ending up at the Whitney museum. Also like to stop in to check out the latest at Samsung 837 (i love going here, lol even though I know it's a complete advertisement hole, there's just always something fun) and then grabbing ice cream/coffee and people watching at Washington square park

- take the metro north to Fordham, grab some great Italian on Arthur avenue and then take the D to Yankee stadium, walk around and then take the D to 145th to walk down covent street if it's nice, end up near Columbia, grab a bite to eat (Hungarian pastry) and then do the vertical tour of St. John. 

Wow, that was  a lot longer than I intended. Currently stuck in traffic on the bus, so I have time to think of more lol.

6,"Meh, I don't care what they do. They're vital to the city's economy. If you live/work/or hang out in the touristy parts of the city, you should know what you're getting involved in"
7,Please don't hog the sidewalk. There are people here who walk faster than you.  Leave room for them to pass you.
8,Stop telling me about how great open spaces are. I've been to open spaces. There's nothing to do.

10,"There was an area in the East village that was Ukranian, and vestiges remain, like the [Ukranian East Vilage Restauran](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ukrainian-east-village-new-york)t, and the [Ukranian Museum](http://www.ukrainianmuseum.org/) and a [Ukranian Catholic church](http://www.brama.com/stgeorge/). However, that population is aging/being pushed out.

There's also a neighborhood, called ""Little Odessa"" in Brighton Beach, which is an active and concentrated Ukranian and Russian neighborhood, with large specialty supermarkets for slavic goods, the crazy supper clubs, [Master Theater](http://mastertheater.com/) etc etc.

11,Hey we're not all tourists waiting for the light to turn for us to cross the street. Sometimes I'm just not in a hurry to get anywhere and don't feel like playing frogger to cross the street. 
12,"to explain more in detail, since possibly OP is thinking of visiting NYC? if you need to stop walking on a busy sidewalk, pull over first so the person behind you doesn't walk into your back / you don't block traffic. if you're on an escalator, walking is on the left, standing is on the right. don't stop at the top of escalators and stairs. move toward the interior of subway cars to make room for those entering, if necessary. on busy train, remove backpacks and don't block empty seats with luggage/groceries/helmets/bags"
13,You should be aware that you're going to probably end up homeless on the street.
14,"Working Girl - because its one of few movies that shows a low-status worker with a long commute (even if that's incidental to the story). 

Seinfeld (tv show) - because most of what New Yorkers do is just hanging around talking about whatever -- not doing exciting stuff (just like life anywhere). Plus their living situations were relatively reasonable compared to most TV shows. Seinfeld was a well-known national comedian and had a small 1 BR apartment... Elaine, a writer,  always had roommates which can be accurate for mid-30s professionals in NYC in her field. 
"
15,"So, I've been living on Roosevelt Island for almost 2 years now.  
We absolutely love living here.  
I snapped this out of my bedroom window, while typing this: http://imgur.com/a/894ME  
It's really central (you get basically anywhere in Down/Midtown in 30 minutes, 10 minutes to Central Park, 25 minutes to my work in SoHo), but it's really quiet and safe. There is also a strong feeling of community, after a short while you know almost everyone on the island and people are really nice to each other. The school is good (though not great).  
The groceries are a bit of a challenge, as others said. Gristedes is expensive even by Manhattan standards, there is also an organic food/East Asian groceries store called ""Wholesome Factory"", which is also not cheap. There is a Costco right across the bridge in Queens, so normally we would take a bus to go there and an Uber on our way back, that dramatically reduces the costs.  
Transport situation: there is an F train and the tram. Tram is much more reliable, you can get to UES 24/7 every 10 minutes. Bottom line, I have never been stuck on the island being unable to leave.  
We don't own a car -- there is literally no free parking on the island. (Fun fact: RI is the only place in NYC where the parking isn't free at night, even for residents). If you do end up owning a car, there is a big parking lot, the monthly pass will cost you $100-150, not sure how much exactly. The only bridge connects the island to Queens (even though Queensboro Bridge passes right above the island), so if you want to go to Manhattan, you need to pass through Queens first and then be stuck in the traffic on Queensboro Bridge).  
Just to end on the positive note -- for us, the pros outweigh the cons and we love it here.  
Will be happy to respond if you have questions."

18,"I've done this so many times... It just happened again 3 months ago. Assuming the apartment lease is signed and you're definitely moving in, the steps are:

  * understand rules for moving into new place- hours? insurance for movers? service entrance?
  * contact moving companies to get a quote for the day of your move. I do full service, where they bring boxes and pack up your old place. 
  * If you don't want to do full service, get some boxes. Either look for free boxes, or what I've also done is gotten the [uline moving kit](https://www.uline.com/BL_7907/Moving-Kits). 
  * Pack up your stuff and ensure you're throwing stuff out that you don't want moved before you move!
  * setup mail forwarding whenever  - you can adjust the exact date on the online form
  * Schedule an installation of internet/ tv (or arrange to pick up the equipment if the infrastructure is in place.)
  * Hire a house cleaner to do a deep scrub of the new place before you move in
  * Do a complete walk-through of the new apartment and make note of anything off or wrong, get fixed if needed or just keep documented so you don't get dinged on your deposit when you move out
  * Schedule a time with the new super to show you the ropes and get the keys. Ask about garbage, recycling, mail, package drop off, house rules, etc.
  * If no laundry in building, scope out your nearest laundromat/dry cleaner/drop-off service
  * You'll probably only get one set of keys from super/landlord. Make copies! I make at least 4. I keep the master keys in a drawer, then 1 set for me, 1 set for my wife, 1 set for my buddy who lives in the hood and can bail me out in case I get locked out, and 1 set for guests/other. 
  * Moving day! Let the company you hired take care of everything. Assuming they work hard &amp; well, tip the guys working a good amount. ($50 each for half day, $100 each for full day)
  * Go grocery shopping for the basics
  * Get blinds for your windows. If you are going custom blinds that won't be ready for a while, you can always get temporary black out blinds. I had [these](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Blackout-Pleated-Shade-6-Pack/dp/B000SDROMG) for 2 months before we got our custom permanent blinds, they were really efficient. 
  * After you've moved, set up bills like con-ed for new service. You'll have electricity already, but you need to setup an account to be billed for service
  * Contact your old landlord to arrange security deposit refund
  * Slowly over the next few weeks change your address at all the places you have on file - banks, work, insurance, etc. 
  * Open house party won't happen for a couple months - don't invite people over until the place feels like home!

19,I thought this was going to be a question about people from New Jersey and the outer boroughs.
20,"I feel your pain, and I am not at all saying there isn't a problem, but this is not a normal issue. Using a twitter search as your proof that it is a universal problem doesn't work. People are only going to talk to the MTA on twitter if they have a problem, and if you were able to go back **2 years** with your twitter search so quickly then it is actually a fairly isolated problem. That is an incredibly long amount of time for a shitload of riders.

I get that you want to vent, but I don't know what real question you are asking us, it seems more of a rhetorical ""what the fuck?!"" than you really looking for an answer, because you know there is no simple answer.

Hopefully someone will have some insight for you, but in the meantime I'm going to say that this isn't really the place for your post your rant."

25,"STEAK!! Steak, damn it!"
26,yes. you're not invited.
27,Bulletproof glass is the first thing I look for when deciding where to get fried chicken
28,The spatially aware comment. And I wish tourists weren't so gullible. It makes me cringe watching them stop for someone trying to just sell them something. 
29,"&gt; For on example, a mounted officer thwarted a bomb in Times Square in 2010.

Well I'll be gosh-darned. I asked because I saw one in Times Square earlier today and I wondered what the heck they did all day.    

It would be kinda fun if they randomly patrolled in the boroughs. "
30,That it's ok to jaywalk within reason. The quickest way to spot a tourist is someone who waits at a red walk light when there are no cars in sight. (Exemptions made for local parents at least trying to teach kids the right thing.)
31,Union protest.  Its the guys with the giant inflatable rat on 42nd.  They sit out there and cause a ruckus to try to disrupt the business they are protesting.  
32,"If you are bad at social interaction with women you would like to date, please do not try to pick women up on public transportation, coffee shops, or just randomly out in public. Bars, meetup groups, apps, social gathering and singles events are where you want to go. Jdate has been very successful for marriage minded Jewish people that I've known in NYC. 

But you will need to have a reason to move here besides fucking dating stats when you talk to people. That just screams all kinds of desperation and is not attractive.

Edit to add: also, you do realize the Nice Guy^TM thing is not a good thing, right? "
33,Your best bet is a hotel lobby. I would suggest the ACE Hotel on 29th and Broadway.  Free wifi and pretty good atmosphere. They may ask you if you want a drink but they won't pressure you to have one. 
34,Introduce them to cocaine 
35,"I think the most recent news story where Mounted Officers actually pursued a suspect in a chase, was June 22 2016 when two mounted officers apprehended a mugger leaving the subway, in the vicinity of 47th and 6th. 

The horses were named Pugsley and Brooklyn.  :D"
36,"Stay on the street, never ride on the sidewalk."
37,"You're in luck!  I used to work for one of those companies that would do this process and charge like $300.  Step one is to get what is called a ""certified copy"" of your birth certificate.  You'll find this at the County Clerk's office at the county you were born in.  Keep in mind you can't find your birth certificate at the Manhattan County Clerk if you were born in Brooklyn or the Kings County Clerk if you were born in Long Island.  I've seen way too many people make that mistake, take time off work, wait in line, and then have to go an hour into the Bronx to start the wait over again.

Once you get there, it'll be simple.  There will be several windows at the County Clerk, just make sure you get in the right one.  Usually there will be a security officer or someone who can point you in the right direction.  Remember, you're looking for what is called a ""certified copy of your birth certificate"".  Any one that works there should be able to point you in the right direction - this is a super common request.  They will produce the copy and either notarize it themselves or ask you to go to a separate line to have it notarized.  This step is important and you will not be able to get an apostille without the copy being notarized.  It might just be a stamp and seal, but again, the people behind the desk will be able to tell you whether or not you've done it right.  This should cost somewhere between $2-15, nothing crazy.  One last note - please be nice to the people there.  90% of them are super friendly and it sucks having to tell people they're in the wrong place, they can't do what they came there for, or whatever.  Think of it as repayment for the help you're getting :).  Anyways, step one complete!

Next, you need to bring this notarized certified copy to the Department of State, which is on William St and Fulton if it's still where it was when I moved (~2 years ago).  This line will be either really short or really long, depending on what time you get there.  If you spend a bit of time getting the certified copy of the birth certificate a separate day, the golden time to get there is around 7-8am as soon as they open.  If you have the means to get there at that time, the process will take 15 mins.  By 9 you're looking at a 1.5-2 hour wait and from there it'll depend on the peak hours.  They're nothing out of the ordinary so 2-3pm shouldn't be a bad time to go.  Despite the wait, this should also be pretty cheap.  I believe it's $10 per document so one copy of the birth certificate should be $10.  On a side note, it might not be a bad idea to get a second copy while you're there for both processes.  Depends on how far on the safe-than-sorry spectrum you are.  Anyways, when it's ready, it should have a fancy looking paper on it with a big gold seal.  Congratulations!  Your document has received an apostille by the State of New York!

Now your situation is a bit different.  I went through the entire process in case it helps someone else some day should they find themselves in your situation.  Almost all of the process can be done by anyone in New York, but the only hang-up is getting the certified copy of the birth certificate.  Bronx County Clerk will require you to either show up in person, send a direct relative (or spouse, most likely), or use vitalchek.  I've never personally used it, but it's legit and used by the courts and records in NYC.  As for the Letter of Exemplification, you will almost certainly not need it if all you're doing is as you say - just an apostille of a copy of your birth certificate.  In summary, I'd either use vitalchek to get the certified copy or have your wife follow my process when she's in town in May, then either have a friend or your wife finish the rest of my process (3rd paragraph).

So there you go!  It's amazing the amount of useless knowledge you accumulate at a dead-end bureaucratic job.  Also amazing how insanely difficult it is to find the process laid out clearly on any government website.  Let me know if you have any other questions!"

You also have to look at it in this way, Bloomberg came in here and got a lot of shit going on his own dime with the provision that if it worked after x time then the city would take it on. de Blasio is a totally different beast so the kind of push and pull from before has changed a lot in many ways. Different class of person, different focus. One not necessarily better than the other, but definitely different."
