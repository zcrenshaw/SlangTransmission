0,Yes. 
1,You can't easily cheat on your taxes when there are clear records of how much you're selling.
2,"In the 1980s, my wife was single and living in Queens.  She found and took home an old writing desk.  (That's nothing special.)  Last month, we gave that desk to a friend.  When I set it down in the friend's house, an envelope fell out of a crevice under the top.  It was a handwritten envelope postmarked 1933 containing photos of the same vintage.  Presumably it had been hidden there for the last 80 years."
3,"Technically, my husband. (Ba da bum.)

But really, we have a boxing dummy in our kitchen that we found on the sidewalk, and it's one of my favorite things in our house. We dress him up for the season."
4,"I saw a drunk guy pee on the tracks

Then he dropped his hat on the tracks

Then he jumped down to get his hat

Then he said ""Aw man I just jumped in my own pee!"" 

There's a lot of stupid rolled up in that one. "
5,"You can get in with a nickel, a wink, and air guns while saying ""Dont spend it all in one place"""
6,why split the rent evenly when two of the rooms are more highly desirable?  The better rooms should be paying $100-200 more depending on rent.  That should settle it quickly.
7,East Side Access. (LIRR trains to Grand Central) 
8,"Not to be a dick, but what kind of doctor? Like, an MD ordered testing for fungal toxins, because you're very sick? 'Cos there's plenty of not-real tests for ""mycotoxins"" - https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a7.htm"
9,"I was in a situation like this once. We did a ""blind auction"" sort of thing, where instead of splitting rent evenly we each wrote down how much we'd be willing to pay above an even split for the better rooms, without seeing each other's bids. Whoever paid the most got first choice, and so forth, and whoever got the ""bad"" rooms ended up paying less. That seems more fair to me than an even split where two people are getting less for their money, and it ensures that whoever cares the most about having a particular room will get their choice.

But whatever you choose to do, I don't think it's fair to your other roommates to keep the same rooms that you have now for the same prices."
10,This is definitely a [DNE](https://memecrunch.com/meme/6N7MG/picard-do-not-engage) situation. 
11,"This, plus they avoid the card processing fees and, if they own the ATM, they earn a fee there too."
12,LaGuardia Airport. 
13,"* People who aren't too chicken shit to jaywalk
* Things open after 10PM"
14,"Its called an art museum but lot of it is actually artifacts/archaeology.  The Egyptian Collection (including an entire small temple) and Arms &amp; Armor are two popular choices for people who aren't that into paintings, and just those two could easily take up a 4-hour day. "
15,"I am not a fire marshal, but something may be on fire."
16,"Not really an answer to the OP but somewhat related story:

I was getting rid of a second TV that we had in our apartment in our bedroom that we never used.  As I was bringing the TV downstairs to place on the sidewalk, I wondered aloud to my girlfriend about how long it would take for someone to take the TV.  As I step outside, a guy walks by and sees me carrying the TV.  We make eye contact and he asks if it still works and if I'm getting rid of it.  I say ""yes"" to both questions and tell him he can have it if he wants it.  He agrees and I hand the TV over to him right there and he just keeps walking down the street, new TV in hand.

The total interaction took maybe 15 seconds and the TV never even touched the ground.  "
17,"Penn Station used to be a gorgeous building, as beautiful as grand central. Then they tore it down to build Madison square garden. As a result, penn station now lives in a basement. The public outrage over the station's destruction actually led to the creation of landmark protection for historically and culturally relevant buildings. There are plans in the future to build a new penn station a block west.  "
18,"One time this guy got on the subway before everyone got of- wait, no, that happens every fucking day."
19,The fucking kosciuszko bridge. 
20,found some weed on the sidewalk a couple of weeks ago. it was pretty good. 
21,"Hahaha okay, good talk. "
22,The Second Avenue Subway. It's been a dramatic 100 or so years and I would love to live to see the whole line running from ~~Chatham~~ Hanover Sq to Harlem. 
23,"This seems like the perfect thing for Task Rabbit. 

But you are not being THAT guy for using the trunk when you get an uber or cab. Cars have trunks for a reason, any driver that makes you feel like a pain for needing to put something in there can go fuck themselves."
24,"If you have been to some nice airports (Hong Kong international airport is the most impressive airport I've been from my experience), a few things are immediately noticeable. 

Cleanliness - is the airport clean? Clean windows? Bathrooms? Lga just feels grimy. There's dust and gunk in every corner if you look closely. There are random spots in terminal chairs that smell like pee.

Modern facility - some airports have motion sensor moving walkways just because. Maybe it saves electricity. Who knows. But at least you know the airport makes an effort to keep up with technology and keep people comfortable. Lga lacks that

Architecture - the Hong Kong airport has a really cool roof that can hold up typhoons but it let's a lot of natural light in. There's a lot of thought put into everything.  Lga just doesn't have that. 

Ease of access getting to airport - you would expect a world class city like new York to have an express train system that takes you straight to the airport, but nope. The fastest way to lga is taking a cab even if you have to sit in traffic. 

Fun - some airports are FUN to be in. Hong Kong airport is pretty much a mall with a food court. Taipei airport has zen gardens and children's play areas. Denver airport has brewpubs. Seattle airport has a sun roof over the food court and there's usually someone playing live piano during the day. Lga is just an airport to get in/get out from

You won't die from going to lga, but you will also spend an extra 15 minutes sitting on the runway because of air traffic congestion. The airport has all the basics you would need from an airport but it's so meh you're better off flying out of a different airport if you have the option."

26,"Hard rock cafe is such a tourist trap, not authentic at all. Please skip. "
27,"Hahahaha this is hilarious, ""don't let someone get that close to you"" we all live in New York dummy, theres over 9million people on these islands. Thanks for the laugh first thing in the morning, you definitely made my day. "
28,"I think you shouldn't be looking for jazz venues if your intention is to talk through the performance. You're looking for places that happen to have live jazz, not jazz places. "
29,"Definitely all of the biking improvements. The city has done a fantastic job of prioritizing them.

For instance, at the beginning of last year, the Union Square bike plan looked like it was designed by someone whose family was killed by a roving gang of cyclists. The 4th avenue bike lane just ended at 14th street with nowhere to go. No real way to go northbound along Union Square East. No bike lanes traveling east from Union Square, etc. Last summer, they fixed the first few problems, and their long-term plan has eastbound bike lanes. They're fixing every problem with it, and they're fixing it in very easy-to-use ways.

There's also a plan that fixes some major navigation problems in Manhattan below the bridges; from the near-impossibility of traveling north up the east side, to safety/traffic improvements for how cyclists connect to the bridge."
30,"I would LOVE to hear what ""appropriate action"" you would take to stop this man."
31,"I always think of 

Summer in the City - Lovin' Spoonful "
32,"&gt;Is it worth it?

You'll be blown away"
33,"I was on the L train and 3 people jumped through the doors as they were shutting 3 separate times so that they kept opening and on the fourth time a woman with a BABY being carried on her chest tried to fit through the doors, BABY FIRST. 

Even the conductor got on the loudspeaker to yell at her."
34,Beg a friend or relative to let you use their couch. Or look around for a cheap Air BnB. Just get the hell out of there.
35,Would you give him an ocular pat-down?
36,"I've been told by formerly homeless people that being ignored is one of the hardest parts as they started feeling like they weren't even human. I can't imagine how devastating it is to have people constantly act like you don't exist. 

I've made conscious efforts since then to stop ignoring homeless people that speak to me. If I don't have money to give, at the very least I can treat them like a person and say ""no thank you"" instead of pretending they're not even there. "
37,"He's non-committal because he doesn't want to have to come deal with his shit. You've been free storage for this person for over a year. How nice of you. You should very politely tell this person they have 30 days to pay you the back rent they owe AND to come get their stuff. When they pay the rent, they can come get the stuff. Otherwise it gets curbed. 

Change the locks. 

PS - Do you know how much a year of storage in NYC is? Expensive AF. Old roomie got a great deal out of you!"
38,"It seems that OP was alert, he noticed the man as he got on the train. The man was weird and a mild annoyance at best, if you feel so threatened then perhaps you are the one that should go back to Ohio, tough guy?"
39,"Nope.  You can get in for $1; the prices you'll see are ""suggested donations""."
