all of it

the whole thing"
1,Go to home depot and buy an AC. 
2,"I saw Donald Trump once, so either that or Santacon."
3,When you're taking friends from out of town to see the Statue of Liberty from the ferry.
4,"Native Staten Islander here: The ferry is free and you could grab a beer for $4 or less on the boat. Plus, when you get off, Flagship Brewery and its tap room are one train stop (or 10-minute walk) from the terminal in St. George. There's a BBQ joint literally next door to the brewery, plus other restaurants/bars by the ferry, including Hop Shoppe, noted on this thread by another commenter.

If you want to see more inside the Island, take the train to Dongan Hills and hit up Lee's Tavern, a divey pizzeria/bar with fantastic, tasty bar pies.

You only need to use a MetroCard on the Staten Island Railway in St. George and Tompkinsville: It's free to ride at most stops. If anything, riding it all the way to the South Shore might be a fun experience for a non-Islander living elsewhere in the city.

Enjoy!"
5,"I would just carry a cane. It's easy, light to carry, not something people need for every single step all the time (as pain can come and go and a cane indicates manageable pain) and the visual cue will immediately signal to others to move without forcing you to say anything.

I take the bus a lot. The second someone comes on with a cane, at least half a dozen people just get up and move, no questions asked. It would make your life a lot easier. Also, you could go all out and get fun or stylish ones to carry."
6,"&gt; Personally, I miss true friendships and deep human connections. Hard to come by in this city.

Are you sure you're not just suffering from ""friends are harder as an adult""? I've had a much, much, much easier time making meaningful friendships and relationships in NYC than I have anywhere else I've ever lived as a post-college adult."
7,I used to get upset when people would get on a subway and be playing some loud videogame full volume or their shitty music without headphones. Now I just assume they have a serious mental disability and I just feel bad for them. 
8,"To a degree, you're right. 

The subway was definitely just as outdated six months ago, but over the course of the last few months there have been some *major* service interruptions during peak hours that have made it significantly more noticeable. Personally I'm thinking of the two times in three weeks that service on the N, R, and D lines was completely shut down during rush hour. I've lived in the city for my entire life and never bothered to get a license because we're fortunate enough to have one of the best transit systems in the world that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but even I'd never experienced anything like that stretch before. 

This is also coming at a time when, from a data standpoint, there has been a demonstrable spike in delays. For example, in 2012 the system averaged about 28,000 delays per month, whereas as of the most recent count this has hit over 70,000. 

Combine that fact with nearly record high ridership and the *very* high profile issues, like the stalled F train that sat in the tunnel for an hour recently with no AC, no lights, and no information on the situation being provided to the riders, and you've got a bit of a perfect storm situation that just looks bad any way you slice it. "
9,"I am no longer foolish enough to try living without AC, but I used to:

* Go to the movies
* Read books on the subway 
* Freeze wet bandannas "
10,"I have such a hard time with this. The person on the train who listens to music or plays games on their phone loudly and doesn't use headphones has a mindset so different from mine that I have difficulty fathoming it and why they think it's okay. It's not just a different mindset, they basically live in a different universe, it feels like. 

Is it just ignorance? Are they trying to look cool and rebellious and impress people with their awesome taste in music? Is it maliciously and willfully inconsiderate? Is it some weird act of dominance? Do they figure that the train is already so shitty and loud and dirty that they're okay with just piling more on? Are they aggressive and trying to bait people into confronting them about it so that they have a justification to get in a fight with them? Are they mentally disabled like you said?

I really try to be a decent person and to be considerate towards other people, so I'm just baffled by the people who are okay with annoying a car full of people because they're too lazy/ignorant/spiteful/whatever to use goddamn headphones. It feels like it's gotten worse lately and the mentality of not using headphones has become more acceptable and widespread. God I hate the way New Yorkers behave in public sometimes. "
11,"Totally read this as ""freeze wet bananas"" and was very confused for a moment."
12,"&gt;(""And you're moving to NYC?!?!"")

There's a reason why dozens of people who actually live in NYC keep telling you that. You're being stubborn and delusional."

15,"hopping in on this because the needless condescension here is gnawing at me. 

I agree that ""My location doesn't inspire me"" is a shit excuse, but what you're saying is far beyond that. You're not an artist unless you earn enough off of your art to pay your bills with it? Bullshit. Some of history's greatest painters and writers died destitute and found fame post-mortem. They don't get disqualified based on their tax returns. The fact of the matter is, until you get your big break, almost all artists need to work other jobs to survive. If the thing you want to do is art, and that's what you put most of your thought and energy to, you're an artist. Calling someone a hobbyist just because they have to work at starbucks to avoid starvation is shit.

Also, MysticalElk wasn't suggesting that you're younger than them by calling you kid, they were doing it because you were doing it to OP in a pathetic effort to make yourself sound superior. They were just calling you out for being pretentious.

TL;DR: You're right to give OP a reality check on her bullshit excuse, but you don't get to shit on everyone who's still struggling to pursue their dreams to make yourself feel cool."
16,"&gt;One thing you may not get though is just how much NYC has been gobbled up by real estate developers and absentee landlords. It just not is the same place it was 20 years ago.

Honestly, what OP is looking for is the New York of 40 or 50 years ago.  I mean even in the 80s (holy shit now 30 years ago) New York was quickly becoming the giant rich person mall that it is today.  NYC still has plenty of ""artists"" but most of them are bankrolled already.  Either by a trust fund or because they were able to earn success before they moved here."
17,"The other guy is an idiot. My husband is in fine dining, has worked as Captain at several Michelin restaurants and started in Boston fine dining.

Assuming that you have some level of charisma, are able to show up to establishments dressed nicely (think skirt, button up shirt, pearls kind of nice - look like the clientele), and can create resume - you want to go in person. Craft a resume based around fine dining things. Give yourself lots of bullet points about your French wine experience - places love seeing that you've got the language down. If they focus on Greek or Italian or South American, they'll teach you. Then go through Michelin lists and Zagat and start hitting the pavement to the specific, well-reviewed places that fit the kind of environment you're looking for. There are loads and loads and loads of high-end business lunch places all over midtown that will be happy with your background. Always apply for server positions, but be sure to mention that you're open to other positions if they offer the opportunity to move into service. 

On your resume (and yes, I'm for real, write a resume. I know several people who were able to end up in gigs way above their experience level simply because of the things the resume demonstrated about them) be sure to spin your high-end retail as the ability to deal with customers with specific taste preferences and detailed knowledge of the product. 

If you didn't have any fine dining experience, I'd tell you to go work at a where ever place to get NYC on your resume, but Boston is close enough that it gets more credit than experience from say, Miami, would. If you're really desperate to be earning right away, you can look into these spots in Times Square, as the churn there is bananas, but it's much easier to get into white linen without that stop gap on your resume. "
18,"There is a vast difference in quality of instruction and social experiences between the best and the worst public schools in New York, depending on neighborhood and lots of other factors, so take whatever any one person says about it with a grain of salt as the next person you talk to might have had the completely opposite experience."
19,"When people are wearing backpack speakers and walking down the block as if we're all impressed they're capable of playing loud music. 

Oh, and cars with bass so loud I can feel it from my car with my windows shut. Why do people think others are impressed by *noise*?"
20,"Darkness in the night sky to see stars.

Absence of car horns.  

Things that exist in the absence of guaranteed anonymity, like patience and a sense of community (vs. ""every man for himself"" and mistrust)."

22,"People who sit on their horns in traffic, honking for no other reason than frustration. GRRRRRRRRRR"
23,"If you're white, yes, if you're black you'll be shot by the NYPD. "
24,The SI ferry passes by the statue and is free. The tourist ferries from downtown and Jersey are paid and go to the statue. Enough people take advantage of the view that SI ferryboats list noticeably towards the statue side.
25,"there is literally zero chance of you finding an apartment anywhere in lower Manhattan for $800. The lowest you'll get, and that's if you're lucky and have lots of roommates, is at least $1k (probably like $1.5k)"
26,###SHOWTIME!
27,"Listen, I admire your optimism, but here's some harsh truth. 

I grew up on Long Island (that fish shaped deal jutting out of NYC). If you're unfamiliar with the place, know this: everybody who grows up there either hates it or is on so much heroin they don't care anymore. My entire life the city was an escape from that place. If you think LA is bad, trust me, it can get worse. I grew up in a place lacking even the ghost of a culture. You ever see the movie ""Pleasantville""? Imagine that but with more racism, depression,  and substance abuse. 

There's a pattern with Long Island youth. They go to college, then they immediately leave if they can manage it. Most end up in NYC. I'm no different. I was a suburban punk who wanted to go live with my friends, go to shows every night, write, chain smoke on my stoop, and generally feel like I was in a place where something is *happening*. Anything at all. 

I love New York City to this day, I love the energy the place exudes, I love its diversity. I love the people I meet on the street and all that stereotypical shit. 

But now I know that my idealized image, that punk rock fantasy shit, was just that. Me and my friends work all the damn time, if they fuck up at all they're out on the street. It is not an easy life. If you don't have a stable job lined up New York city can go from being exciting to absolutely fucking hellish very, very, quickly. 

This is why a lot of Long Island kids inevitability end up moving back to Long Island, or go down south to Virginia or something. Because for as beautiful as New York city is, it is not a paradise. And too many people are stuck in the illusion that it is. It will eat you alive if it can. And believe me, it wants to. You'll know what I mean when, on the subway to your third part time job, you look up from your book, still groggy, to witness the homeless junkie jacking off in front of you, looking you dead in the eyes. One way or another, you're sick of this shit.  

I know that's a strange image but believe me this place can fuck with your head without you even realizing its fucking with your head. The amount of insanity your average new yorker encounters daily dwarfs anything you might imagine. If you're not willing to struggle, and I mean *actually struggle*, don't move to New York unless you have your shit thoroughly together. 

But it's more than that. Fact is I always blamed where I lived for the fact that I was pissed off and depressed all the time and that I had no motivation to do any of the things I wanted to do. I moved and guess what? I'm still me. I was always just looking for excuses. And really it's the same story with every arty hipster type I encounter. They think they can ""make it!"" if they're just in the right place. 

Fact is no matter where you go, where you live, your community is what you make it. Value the people around you and you'll have it. Plop yourself by yourself in the middle of a city you don't know? You won't. 

Sometimes the kid's gotta face it: they're always gonna be stuck on long island "
28,I think it's anti-social stuff. I think some people are basically just pissed off all the time and it brings them joy to know they are annoying other people. 
29,don't run in the bike lanes
30,"&gt; So you're not motivated, your ability to earn money likely requires you to commit fraud against the US government, but we're the assholes because you're a law-breaking, naive moron whose self-label of ""artist"" is probably about as meritorious as Jeremy Pivens' ego.

That felt good to read.  You should move to NYC as a screenwriter."
31,"So clearly in your own words now describe what the difference between an artist and art as a hobby is, kid."
32,"Just to put things in perspective, while we don't know your life experiences and circumstance YOU also don't know the stories of the people giving you advice except for the fact that they do live in nyc. Their life could be cushier or harder than yours. Dismissing their advice because they ""don't get it"" can be seen as hypocritical when the lack of knowledge of each other's lives are on both sides. Especially so when there's many people reiterating the same points.

The pushback you're getting may be wrong or right but dismissing anything negative the way you are is naive."
33,"It's tough. In a subway situation, it's not like you'll be given much opportunity to explain your physical condition, should you request a seat. Chances are the person in that seat will have as long a ride as you, if not longer, and might not trust that you really have a disability. Seek out the friendliest looking able bodied person and develop an elevator pitch version of your situation that you can quickly and effectively deliver? I'd say in a lot of cases, politeness can work, so long as you're prepared for people to say no. Someone would probably take pity. "
34,That's pretty douchey on your part. 
35,"You know how Disney is really protective about kids seeing Mickey without his mask on, lest their illusions be shattered? Now imagine another sacred childhood character, only there are at least 10,000 of them covered in vomit and tripping over themselves as they scream vulgarities and whip out body parts in public.

This is SantaCon."
36,Do not rent remotely. Book a place to stay for a month and conduct your search when you arrive. 
37,"I found a beautiful antique armoire on the street once,  unfortunately I couldn't move it into my building that day so I was forced to leave it on the street for the night. I asked my friend to guard it but in a cruel and bizarre twist of fate 2 homosexual thugs with a penchant for charity and bullying accosted my friend and absconded with the armoire. "
38,"Cocktail attire is perfect. 

Tasting menu is a great idea.

Get wine pairings with the tasting menu. They will bring you glasses to match a course or two throughout the night. "
39,"Landlord can price two exact units at different prices. Your argument would fall on deaf ears.  He can place one free and one at a million if he wanted. I would refrain from souring your relationship with your landlord, especially if you like the apartment. "
40,"My kids (middle school and high school) were talking yesterday about this. They kind of like that a lot of the busy-ness of a regular American high school is not there. No football or basketball team or cheerleaders at either school, there isn't that insane cliquishness, there isn't a lot of bullying. There isn't the emphasis on sports--the teams they do have are open, and while they compete in the city schools leagues, there's a much greater sense of true sportsmanship. They play because they like playing, not because it ""matters."" 

Because of the way our high schools are largely divided by interest, at the higher levels, there are virtually no discipline problems or interruptions. All the kids at my son's high school are there because they like studying the topic the school focuses on. Nobody is there who doesn't want to be there. 

My kids loving having freedom to get around the city and see things. They go to museums, go hang out in parks and squares, and have experiences that kids in other parts of the country don't have. They get a Metro card and get themselves to school via subway. As a parent, I like that they're learning independence and problem-solving, which I think will help them in their adult lives. 

Diversity is huge here. For the kids, it's sort of no big deal, which is the way it should be. 

I like that they get to do interesting field trips. My kid's high school does two yearly overnights to learn about some aspect of US History where it happened. That's probably pretty common for NE corridor schools, though. 

The NYC DOE serves about 1.1 million kids. That does create some economies of scale, and the school system offers an amazing array of interest-focus schools. But not all schools are good, and there are never enough seats in the top schools for all the kids who want to attend. We've been proactive and lucky in getting seats in the schools we chose, but not everyone comes out on top. "

47,"A couple days ago a dude on the subway brought one of those hand held loud speakers onto the train and started blasting loud, vulgar music. One of the passengers shot him a dirty look. Boombox dude and his buddy get in the other passenger's face and start talking shit and threatening him and snatch his phone out of his hands.

 Finally two hugeass dudes at the other end of the car stand up and start yelling at boombox dude to give the phone back, that he shouldn't be bullying someone that didn't do something to him, and that they're being disrespectful to everyone (especially the children) by playing that music. Boombox dude gives the phone back and looks like he's going to try to fight the two big guys. But after exchanging some words he turns the music off.

So shitty people but also some equally awesome people."

49,"So, from a brokers perspective, StreetEasy is ""the best"", however, not everything is on StreetEasy. There are plenty of landlords that don't advertise on StreetEasy, or anywhere else, and rely on brokers to advertise their listings. These listings aren't on StreetEasy because you need signed exclusives to advertise on StreetEasy, and they are what's known as ""open listings"", meaning any broker who knows about them can advertise. 

These will be on sites like RentHop, NakedApartments (also now owned by Zillow), and Zumper/PadMapper. These sites are less ""fresh"" because brokers usually need to update and remove ads manually as opposed to their feed that goes straight to StreetEasy and updates. However, there is a bunch of stuff on those sites that isn't on StreetEasy.

If I was a renter, knowing what I know, I would look on all of those sites."

52,"So, the landlord is paying a broker fee. OP's broker is just being greedy and shady. It sounds like they're not actually even meeting OP to show him the apartment. This is why people hate brokers. Do nothing, get paid by the landlord 1 month, and demand a 15% from the client. Awful."
