0,"Frankly, it's their neighborhood, not yours.  You are a guest, so stop acting like you're entitled to have the residents of Washington Heights conform to your ideals of what their neighborhood should be like.  Instead of broadly painting an entire neighborhood as criminals and deviants maybe keep an open mind when visiting someplace new.

Just because you don't understand the culture of the neighborhood doesn't mean these people are beneath you."
1,"I dumped someone because the commute between our apartments required switching between Times Square and ~~Penn Station~~ Port Authority through that long ass hallway. Does that count?

Edit cause I'm a dumb."
2,"Wake up to an alarm clock.

Look out the window, dress accordingly.

Stumble blearily to the nearest bodega and pay a dollar for some shit coffee because the baristas at the hip spot across the street ask too many questions and charge too much for black coffee.

Go to the subway station, pack like sardines into a car.

Report to any office building, sit in the lobby for 8 hours and contemplate every choice you've ever made, break for lunch around 1:30, wait in line behind a tourist from Dallas who won't shut the fuck up about northerners not being nice. Behind you will be someone in an NYU sweater talking about how amazing whatever bar the gothamist/bushwickdaily/Bedford and Bowery did an article on yesterday is. You will order something simple, they will fuck it up.

After fake work, go to a bar, any bar, because the part of your brain that registers joy only works one day a week. Order a cheap beer, get shit from some rube about the oppressive beer conglomerate that owns said beer company and how he supports local Brewers. Ignore him and repeat 3 times.

Get on the subway, wait for some assholes to start doing backflips and then talking shit when you don't pay.

Go home to your over priced apartment, sit down on your favorite sitting implement. Turn on NY1, light your bong, kick your feet up and repeat after me: I Love this fucking town."
3,"You've really done nothing that he can evict you for, and even if you had, he's got to go to court and get an order from a judge.  Here in NYC, this is easily a multi-month endeavor.

That being said, it sounds like he isn't the most mentally stable person, and it might be in your best interest to start apartment shopping, regardless."
4,"You picked Washington Heights man. That's the hub for Dominican life in the city and they like to party. I don't want to be a dick, but I am because you are. If you wanted a nice quite neighborhood you should have done more research, also you went to the city that never sleeps..."
5,Call the landlord now and call the police next time this happens. Walking in on naked homeless people is definitely not a question of being compassionate or not.
6,"Cloisters. Do it before it gets cold but in saying that, it could be quite beautiful in the fall just before it gets too miserable. It feels like a different world. "
7,"There is a pinball bar laundromat in Greenpoint, and I know a few offer coffee. My personal opinion is there aren't more bar laundromats because it would require space, which is at a premium here. Furthermore, current owners of laundromats have no incentive to renovate, since people are still going to come to do laundry anyway, so why spend the vast amount of money and time for something that's already making them a profit? Lastly, I'd say that a LOT of people do drop off service, so this isn't that much of an appeal anyway. You can just walk over to the closest bar between cycles if you want to socialize. "
8,"SometimesÂ I ask about dating horror stories on first dates. Everyone has one, and some of them are really good. This is the best one I've ever heard:

She went on a few dates with a guy, no red flags. Then one day, out of the blue, she gets a text from him: ""Do you have any deep secrets that I should know about?"" She said it made her nervous. But, she rationalized it might not be bad. It was so random. Maybe it wasn't even meant for her. She replied ""Haha no, not really. Why, do you?""

Then she starts listening to a podcast episode about dating in New York City. The host was fielding listener phone calls. One of the listeners called in about a guy she was dating. Few dates, no red flags. Then one day, out of the blue, she gets a text from him. ""Do you have any deep secrets that I should know about?"" It turned out that the listener was dating an adult baby. Apparently, this guy was a normal guy during the day. But at night, he had a fetish that when he went home, he wanted to wear an adult diaper, act like an infant, and have a mommy take care of him.

A few hours later, the girl gets a response to her text. ""I can be a bit of a baby."" She said it freaked her out enough that she never responded to him again.

No idea if it's true, but MAN I love the story."
9,"You can think that, but until you call you won't know that. You're being way too relaxed about this shit, I find a naked dude in my laundry room and I'm kicking doors down, this is insane shit you're dealing with. Call fucking everybody, THERE ARE NAKED PEOPLE IN THE PLACE YOU LIVE WHO DONT LIVE THERE."
10,"A good look into modern NY life is probably Masters of None. It has the struggle of being here, dating, being a minority, the crazy new york things that happen. You can binge watch the whole first ond only season so far on Netflix."
11,"1: 2nd date, He asked me to come out to a bar in Brooklyn. I ventured all the way out there on some sketchy-ass road go into an unmarked door and I'm kinda scared. Turns out the bar is actually a club and it's his friend's birthday party. I'm not dressed for the club at all, I'm wearing jeans and sandals bc this guy told me it was a ""chill bar"". They had a small table of like 10 people who all knew each other since high school and birthday girl is giving me stink eye for crashing her party.  I awkwardly hang out for a bit then sneak away when I can't take it anymore. He never called to ask where I went or apologize or anything. 


2: Met up with a different guy at a bar in midtown on a Thursday. It was a first date. He proceeded to get wasted and tell me that he loved me, we're soulmates, and that I'm marriage material. The next morning he texted me saying he blacked out and overslept, missed work and now he's on job probation. Sucks for him, good thing I work from home on Fridays. Never texted him back.

Edited to add cause I just remembered: The kid who kept going on and on about his investment banking job at BOA, and then after further investigation turned out that we was actually just a summer intern and still in school at NYU."
12,"Go to Red Hook. Seriously. Not enough new yorkers hang out there, I started working there in high school, it's quickly become my favorite place in the world.[This map will guide you.] (http://66.media.tumblr.com/6b8b7504877ae4a82b6904b583405533/tumblr_mkbx0cmOTJ1qjywlvo1_500.png) Fun bars, great food, great people, great views, great art...come on New Yorkers, let's make Red Hook great again!"
13,"Yeah, the last time I got stone cold dumped, part of his reasoning was that he lived in Brooklyn and I lived in the Bronx, although he never once came to my place. I find out a year later he moved to Seattle to follow someone who was going to grad school there, so I guess that commute was a little easier. "
14,"Yes the few people near your particular window are representative of the entire neighborhood. Watch phrases like ""these people,"" which are often used by racists. The fact that you couldn't possibly have any idea about where or how the people making noise were educated makes me think that you're basing this judgement solely on appearances. 

I've got college kids next door to me who party all the time. I doubt you'd call them uneducated. Ask yourself why you're ""going there."""
15,maybe it's just because i smoke a lot of weed but broad city is like a fucking documentary
16,"Ha!!! Wait until tonight and then ..... Tomorrow.... You think the Heights is loud on a Wednesday... Wait until it gets hot on a Fri or Sat night. 

And BTW. I've worked for awhile in Washington Heights. I found the people to be kind, intelligent and family oriented.  I'm thinking that you've never run into a dominantly oriented Dominican area.  This would be that. Good Luck"
17,"| Am I the only one in NYC who loves him?

This is the answer to every ""am I the only one"" question: No. You are never the only one.

He was elected for three terms, what makes you think you're in the minority?"
18,"Fiscally conservative, socially liberal describes a lot of NY'ers, so no, you're not alone."
19,"I once met a guy that was 20 years old, born and raised in Queens, and had never been to Manhattan. They are out there."
20,"I am so very glad that you had a good time and that you came to post here about it, but MOST OF ALL - THANK YOU for doing some of your own research and THANK YOU for being brave enough to just go and check out a strange place for lunch! "
21,"I know that generally people complain about how the first date can feel like an interview, but I think NY'ers take it to another level. So many dates try WAY too hard to impress me with their jobs, who they know, where they've traveled... None of that matters when it comes to compatibility/chemistry, and I get so turned off by their laundry list that I just tune out and think of ways to end the date. 

The best is when they tell me where they intend to move after they're done with NYC. Thanks for the heads up that you have no long-term intentions. "
22,All you need is one person with a fucking weapon and you're hosed. You are not making a big enough deal about this. Call the police.
23,"Start carrying your phone with the camera already recording as you enter/leave the building or anticipate interacting with him. When he calls you, or you call him, have your phone on speakerphone and record the call with a second device, like a laptop or tablet. Report anything you can to 311 and HPD. Create a written record of all interactions including descriptions and dates. Collect evidence of payment on time over the history of your stay. Speak with other tenants in the building if you can find them. "
24,"Liquor licenses are expensive and hard to get. When you get one, you want to make as much profit as possible and not everyone who is doing laundry wants to drink when they're dong laundry. Almost no one wants to go drink in a laundromat on a saturday night. "
25,"If you are staying around the Times Square area, even though NYC is relatively safe  I still would not go traipsing around the city at 3am with an infant - and would stick to Times Square.

You might want to wander around in some of the big hotel lobbies like the Times Square Marriott (you go up an elevator to get to the lobby)."

27,"Wait wait wait. She actually went out with him again after this?
"
28,"I don't know if this is an ""ONLY IN NYC"" thing, but....

Met up with this guy and we're hanging out with some of his friends at their place. I thought things were going well, we kissed a bit, were drinking, I got along with his friends, etc. That was until he invited another girl over and they started making out on the couch. They eventually went into the bathroom to bone and I left because awkward. One of his drunk friends walked me out and tried to make out with me on the way. 

Next day, dude messages me ""Had a great time! Hope you did too!"" I called him out for inviting somebody else over without mentioning it to me first and he offered to make it up to me. So I made him buy me lunch (he had offered, after all), and during the lunch he explained to me ""I mean, how often do you get to have butt sex!?"". 

 "
29,I see you've already started with the jokes.
30,Ended it with a great gal bc I had to pay tolls to go see her. Tolls are my parameter for what would constitute a long distance relationship. 
31,"After living in the city for 11 years and my husband living in the city his whole life (except for the 4 years he was in college), we just moved to the 'burbs 2.5 months ago and we are thrilled.   
   
It was a variety of factors that lead to us leaving, including:    
(1) we were starting a family (just had a baby 5 weeks ago) and wanted more space, a yard and didn't want to deal with the NYC schooling situation.   
(2) it was the right time to sell our apartment and make $ on the sale.    
(3) we were enjoying activities that were tough to do in the city more and more (e.g. - cycling, going to the beach, collecting wine, grilling, skiing).   
(4) we weren't taking advantage of the city nightlife the way we used to and frankly, that's a huge draw to living in the city.   
(5) the daily grind was becoming grinding rather than inspiring as it was when we were younger and it was taking us longer to bounce back from city annoyances (subways too crowded, Duane Reade sucking, grocery shopping always a hassle)."
32,"Unless this is some gold plated heirloom bed, the cost and hassle to ship it from North Carolina will likely be more than just going to a furniture store here and buying a new one plus delivery."
33,Citymapper is my transportation app of choice. 
34,"Similarly, I kept a Thing going for about two months longer than I otherwise would have, just because it was like two subway stops from my house to hers. "
35,"Olive Garden, where they, uh, treat you like family..."
