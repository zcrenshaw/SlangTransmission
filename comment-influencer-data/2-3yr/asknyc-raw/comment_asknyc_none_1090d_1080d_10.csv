0,Asking the important questions OP.
1,"You mean, your drug dealer also cuts hair. "
2,It's just good natured ribbing. I'd live in Hoboken or Jersey City over the vast majority of Brooklyn.
3,"Because New Jersey decided to build their highways through industrial areas and swamps instead of right through the places they live. I love New Jersey, my parents actually moved down the shore full time a couple years back so I'm there often enough. "
4,"Two kinds of problems in this world - your problem, and not your problem.

This is not your problem."
5,"If you moved here right before summer, you've hardly been here long enough to have a real social network let alone a good grasp on dating and any inkling at a real relationship. Give it more time before you get disheartened. 

I also think that, in this city, looking to settle down seriously at 25 is pretty not standard. I'd wager that you're in the minority. You might try things like using dating websites that cater to religious crowds or targeting men who are older and looking for that kind of stability. 

That all said, if children and a husband and all that is a life priority for you, you should certainly keep in mind the idea that this might not be the perfect city for you. There's no reason to write it off already, but it's definitely a consideration. I have a few female friends that waited until mid to late 30s to leave the city in hopes of finding that lifestyle and they have had a very difficult time."
6,"This isn't unique to New York. It's all part of getting older. Studies have shown that people get more conservative over time. Less adventurous. That's just human nature. I'd say a large part comes from the biological desire to have kids and pass along those genes. Not everyone has that desire, but most people do, and it usually results in added responsibilities and added caution. When you're living for yourself, its easy, maybe even beneficial to take risks, be different, go against the flow. But when you have a spouse who is looking for someone reliable, someone stable, when you have a kid who you need to raise and keep out of danger, when you have a job you rely on to support your family-- then the kinds of devil-may-care individuality that was so easy in your youth becomes dangerous. And even if you don't give a fuck, it doesn't change the fact that the majority of the people around you will. They've left those things behind.

I don't think there's any hate there, but it's pretty hard to go to that punk concert when you've got to pay a babysitter and besides, you've got that early morning conference call with corporate and oh yeah, the in-laws are coming in for dinner. So you'll start saying, ""sorry man"" to your friend who just wants to rage out. To the guy who isn't there yet, this can seem cold, or like ""selling out,"" or just being lame. But at a certain point, as your friends peel away and grow up, there's just few people left your own age who are doing the kind of things you did when you were younger. There's a bunch of new young people who are into the arts, goth, hardcore, they're raging out and having a great time... but they don't identify with you. So you're stuck being the weird old one trying to hang with the kids, or you're finding smaller and smaller groups of people your own age to hang out with. So it goes. At a certain point, everyone either settles down or decides to go it solo. It's the in between that can be gut-wrenching.

Edit: That said, I can't explain anyone voting for Trump. Maybe it was all those drugs."
7,"It's not just fare beating.  Unless I am mistaken, the turnstile swipes are used to determine usage of the station.  That impacts services.

If the MTA thinks less people are using a station, the quality and frequency of the service will decline."
8,The bathroom at the Mariott.
9,Not a store but one of the stands at the Union Square Farmers Market had lots of really nice apples. The employees looked fairly knowledgeable and we're talking to shoppers about the apples they had for sale that day. I'd definitely recommend checking it out especially since the season is in full swing.
10,"If someone says something like ""I know Jersey kinda sucks but most of its reputation is undeserved and it's got a lot going for it,"" I'm like, ""oh my gosh, totally, it's so unfair how it has a bad rep!""

But if someone drunkenly screams ""Jersey, woo!"" I'm liable to yell in a rageful fugue state, ""Go back to your shit state you B&amp;T trash person!""

So it's contextual. "
11,"I think you'll find that people in NYC tend to settle down / get married significantly later than other parts of the country. In most large cities, this is the case, but I think it's the most pronounced in NYC.

Give it some time to build out your social network and to meet other people. Especially at your current age, most of your peers probably aren't specifically looking for something long-term. It's also a function of the environment - in an always-stressful, bustling, and densely populated city, people have to juggle multiple work and personal priorities and the opportunity to meet someone else is always present."
12,My barbershop sells drugs. 
13,"This is one of the harder questions I've had to answer here, so I guess you deserve some kind of commendation for that. As you may have realized by now, NYC is not known for their strip clubs, so that could partially explain it. Despite my tight queries, I still got more hits in Texas than false hits in NYC. For what it's worth, here's all I found:

* One reference to a lunch buffet at Gallagher's 2000 in this [Gothamist list](http://gothamist.com/2015/08/20/best_strip_clubs_nyc.php) from 2015.

* A single [2007 reference](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ricks-cabaret-new-york-2?q=buffet) to a breakfast buffet at Rick's Cabaret, whose lunch was given a fairly decent rating on [Midtown Lunch.](http://midtownlunch.com/2008/09/15/ricks-cabaret-strip-club-lunch-ten-dollar-new-york-city-nyc/)

* There's a [""T&amp;A Buffet"" on Fridays from 6-8pm](http://sapphiremanhattan.com/NY-Sapphire-Friday-Happy-Hour.html) at Sapphire."
14,"Real New Yorkers don't do this because they have been to the nice parts of NJ visiting friends etc.  I mean shit I've considered moving there many times.  But recent transplants are all uppity about living in NY so they think that by trashing NJ it will make them seem more legitimately ""city people"", plus what the other person said about where NJ constructed their highways.  I mean it is true that ""bridge and tunnel"" visitors to the city can be loud/annoying (esp when drunk) but that's just because they are, to some extent, tourists.  "
15,"You're 22. In the NYC dating scene, you're a baby. And most of the kids in college here are too into their bohemian fantasy from watching Rent. Just focus on growing as a person and in 3-4 years you'll be fine."
16,"Le Parker Meridien, 56th between 6th and 7th in Midtown, has a fantastic burger joint conspicuously hidden (i.e. not really very hidden) in a small alcove off the lobby.

It's called Burger Joint."
17,"It was too late, he typed it in."
18,"The Standard (both East Village and Meatpacking) has some pretty great offerings restaurant-bar-and-beer-garden wise. Nice for ping pong.

My favorite is McCarren Hotel in Williamsburg, which has an outdoor saltwater pool that is available for a ~$65 fee."
19,You're being paranoid. If anything its safer now because of that idiot. Everyone went to work monday like nothing happened. 
20,"This is where you should utilize your local NYPL library branch! If not, you can always hit up the main one in Bryant Park - it is a beautiful space. "
21,Steal your dads cab and drive to that party in the LES. Pick up that random girl passenger in the East Village and then hit up the beach together in the UES. Go to her place after play some tequila games and see what happens the night of.
22,"Sitting on a lawn chair when they first turned Times Square into a pedestrian plaza with a 24 of OE at 1am. One of my favorite memories, had the whole place damn near to myself."
23,Ten minutes is far?
24,"Sometimes yes. Growing up, I would hear the Mr Frosty jingle at like 11pm and think ""wtf ice cream now?""      

The driver was playing it for he junkies. The cops caught on after two or three summers.  "
25,"Wow, was expecting to come here for a roast but you seem to have some sort of plan. Poughkeepsie is not at all what I would call close to NYC, but it's a lot closer than Boise. Comedy and painting won't be paying any bills for a very long time so focus on getting some work as soon as you get here. Expect the first year at least to suck absolute dick until you get your bearings and get on your feet and start making friends. Get roomates, Astoria will be the upper limit of where you can live even with roomates, and woodlawn will be tougher to find roomates in. This is you flying by the seat of your pants for probably the next two years, you need to learn to react and be an adult much faster than most people your age, even people your age in NYC for college. I'm giving you the best odds I've ever given someone with one of these posts, so 65% chance of you falling flat on your fucking face and packing it in within a year... That's optimism here. I don't believe in if you want it hard enough you'll make it happen, but you seem willing to put your back into it, good luck kid."
26,"That branch is a Research Library - most of the books were held in huge underground stacks that have never been accessible to the public but have to be requested via a fairly complex process and cannot be checked out.

I say ""were"" because most of the books were sent off to a New Jersey storage facility with the Library leadership expecting to transform the old stacks into a giant lounge area - but even though the plan was nixed, the books still have not been returned to the Library stacks (and a good many of those may have been damaged during the move to NJ).

The libraries with accessible stacks are called ""Circulating libraries"" - and there is one of the bigger ones across from the Research Library on 5th Ave and I think 41st or 40th st."
27,"You know how every once in a while someone starts a ""joke"" subreddit poking fun at something, and within weeks/months the subreddit gets taken over by True Believers who forgot it was a joke? (see: /r/pcmasterrace).

Yeah, it's that basically. It's good-natured ribbing that sometimes gets taken waaaaaaay too far by people who want to lord the fact that they live in NYC over somebody else."
28,Long Island is New Jersey with shittier highways and more traffic though.
29,"The [official PDF](http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf) is vector graphics - blow it up to any size you like with no distortion.

EDIT: if you're looking for other maps, they're [here](http://web.mta.info/maps/). Make sure you get the PDF versions of them."
30,Because you have terrible budgeting skills. Head to /r/personalfinance to get sorted out.
31,"Just me, but I think it's rude to use a subwoofer in an apartment setting, full stop. My last neighbor played bass constantly and I very nearly lost my mind and moved back home after a year of living with it. I went so far as to purchase an acoustic mat for his sub, and it still didn't solve the issue. Bass is the most difficult frequency for your neighbors to drown out, it travels straight through walls and floorboards like they aren't even there, and you don't realize how irritating it is because you hear it in conjunction with the rest of your audio but your neighbors only hear and feel the vibrations.

"
32,"As a commenter in another thread said...

He's kind of like NYC's Harambe. Before the incident of course. "
33,"My dad died unexpectedly a few days after Christmas and I found out two hours before I got on a plane from my home state back to NYC. We were estranged but it still hit me hard. On New Year's two days later I drank alone at a bar, and then walked down to the East River Park in Williamsburg. It was closed so I just hung onto the fence and started sobbing. Some young couple came walking down probably wanting to get a view of the skyline and then heard me crying and turned around and hurried away."
34,"Clean your apartment better, seal any holes, and shove steel wool around any pipe penetrations.    

Grab a bunch of snap traps and use peanut butter as adhesive and put a piece of good hard chocolate on the trigger. The PB will attract it but the chocolate is generally too hard to bite so they'll try to take it with them.    

Use many. Chances are if you have one you have many.    

Prepare for war.   "
35,Drink a fifth of tequila in central park and see what happens. 
36,I commend you on the research.
