0,Getting fucked up on the top of one of those red double decker bus tours to the point of getting kicked off. 
1,"I was on the B38 going towards Ridgewood and someone asked if it was the bus to Staten Island. 

Also in Bushwick a few years ago I was stopped by French tourists who asked if I knew a place where they could get American breakfast foods like eggs and waffles. I pointed out the restaurant I was actually headed to, and they were like ""We don't mean to be rude, but are there any with white people?"" I was so stunned I just walked off and enjoyed my pancakes of color."
2,"I was taking a break from work and walking around the St Marks block when I was stopped by a couple who asked me where they were. I told them that they were in the East Village, pointed out St Marks Place, etc. The girl turns to the guy and goes ""see, I *told* you we're not in Manhattan!"""
3,"You've already noticed the Hasidic Jews. They are a sect that split in the 1800s. Ironically, originally they were into ""modern dress"" of that era, but it fossilized at some point. Their native language is Yiddish, a dialect of German. Unmarried Men and women segregated virtually all the time. Usually men won't even touch a woman, ie to shake hands. All the other kinds of Jews think they are nuts.

Next notch down, Modern Orthodox. Men wear a kippah (small circular hat) women cover their hair with a cloth, or, if hair can be seen it's really a wig. Men and women both dress fairly modestly with women commonly wearing a long black skirt.  Girls and boys both attend modern Yeshiva (Jewish school that also confers a standard hs diploma)) and are encouraged to advanced education. Religious services conducted in Biblical Hebrew. Only men can be Rabbis. Families usually keep kosher ( dietary rules) both in and out of the home. 

Next down, Conservative movement. Modesty practices vary by the individual, but hair is rarely covered, nor is there any noticable ""uniform"".  Looks just like anyone else on the street. Kids typically  go to secular  school with supplementary Jewish education as after school/weekend school. Women can be Rabbis. Religious services conducted partially in English, partially in Biblical Hebrew .  Usually keep kosher inside the home, some don't sweat eating in noncertified restaurants, as long as the food doesn't break any obvious rule. 

Reform Movement. Judaism lite for the half-hearted (originally it was a serious progressive movement but seems to have lost it's way). Genders freely mix, no modesty rules, services primarily in English, women can be Rabbis. Don't keep kosher. Secular education with supplementary Jewish education. 

Reconstructionist: believe in stricter liturgical practice, like keeping kosher, but progressive social practice, like equality of the Genders. More likely than others to be hippie types :) 

All Jews: don't believe in the divinity of Jesus. "
4,"""Is Brooklyn safe to go to? Is it worth going to?""

IT'S NEARLY 3 MILLION PEOPLE AND HAS LIKE 50 NEIGHBORHOODS AND IS BIGGER THAN WHATEVER CITY YOU'RE PROBABLY FROM"
5,I only have two speeds.
6,"On the corner of 34th and 5th. Someone asks me, ""Where's the Empire State Building?""

I just pointed up."
7,"-shots with Bill Murray and Kevin spacey.

-getting kicked out of every major landmark.

-get on tv in the crowd of the today show.

-fight a cabbie and a bike messenger in the same day.

-sex at Jacob Riis with a stranger.

-actually buy drugs off one of the sketchy guys on 7th ave.

-scam a scammer.

-pick up a scores girl.

-pretend to not know a major celebrity and engage them in conversation, insult a movie they were in.

-start a rent strike at the NYU dorms.

-carve my name in the bench at central booking."
8,"I have a close friend who worked as a midtown concierge for several years. Stupid people included: 

- A woman from the Midwest who wanted to visit the 9/11 memorial and ALSO wanted to see the twin towers. No matter how much he explained, she didn't seem to understand that the memorial explained WHY she couldn't see the towers. 

- a family who wanted tickets to The Kings of Leon and got The Lion King instead

- a woman who angrily insisted that The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime was actually called The Tricky Dog Show

- several people who wanted restaurant recommendations but refused to say what they liked or where they wanted to go. IN MIDTOWN. "
9,Last time I checked.
10,100k will go MUCH further in St. Louis
11,"My assistant of three years had just quit to move to Berlin with his fiancee, so the office had leaving drinks which turned into leaving shots. I remember the fifth shot. I remember crying about why the only man I ever loved was leaving. I remember calling his fiancee a green card whore. I do not remember passing out in the Burger King bathroom or the ambulance ride to Bellvue."
12,"And finally culturally non religious.  These are Jews that identify as culturally Jewish but not religiously.  They celebrate some of the holidays, but nothing religious.  Simply keeping the culture of food and holidays.  Example, going to Katz and enjoying a pastrami on Yom Kippur, a day when eating is not allowed."
13,"I used to give walking tours of Chinatown. One time, this teenager said ""I don't usually come to this part of the city. Usually I stick to Manhattan."""
14,"The train continues through to the old City Hall station where it makes a u-turn back to the uptown track. 

You can actually stay on the train and experience this in person and see the abandoned station. "
15,"Was on the UES when a couple came up to me and asked me how they knew which direction to go on the subway to get to Midtown. I told them down town, and they but they said they wanted to go to midtown. I then explained midtown was down town for where we were. I stood there for 7 minutes explaining that midtown isn't an option for a subway. it's uptown or downtown. They asked if I was from here because it seemed I didn't know what I was talking about..."
16,"When I first moved here and was on my way to a job interview I told a lady I was trying to get to Park. She asked ""Park and what?"" and I said "".. Madison?"" and she pointed me in a random direction. Turned out to be correct, but I wonder what was going on in her head at the time. "
17,"damn,the title made it sound like aggravated felony"
18,"I had a woman come up to me in Penn Station, and asked ""is this where I am right now?"""
19,And then I am sure they went home and told everyone how rude all NY'ers are. SMH
20,"I think that's a terrible attitude. Do you feel the same way about an adult learning to ski? I'd wear padding, and I'm looking for a safe place to learn.

Why is there an age limit on picking up a hobby? Why do the teenagers need to be troubled? And above all, why does it matter whether it's cool?!"
21,"I know I shouldn't really get annoyed with this but I used to take the L from 8th Ave back to Brooklyn a lot, and you end up sitting in a non-moving car for a bit because it's the end of the line.  People would always stick their heads into the car and be like 'Is this the side that's going to Brooklyn?'  There's a big fucking wall on one end of these tracks man, they're ALL going to Brooklyn, there is nowhere else to go."
22,"""What train goes to the Statue of Liberty""


Countless questions about rooftops. When IRL I'm much nicer but also much more likely to go off on random historical facts. Did you know the chipotle on st.marks used to be the German cultural society?"
23,"For Hamilton tickets, if you get pregnant next week, you will need to find a babysitter for the next available show dates."
24,"Should have said ""No"", sit back and watch the existential crisis unfold. "
25,Little Italy basically doesn't exist anymore. You don't need to go there. Your Italian heritage will not be reflected there.
26,"*Especially* in new york/east coast, people are very direct, what you would absolutely define as 'confrontational'. This is normal. We don't waste time with subtleties or passive behaviors. The quickest way to loose someone's respect is to waste their time. That goes especially for times when saying ""no"" is the correct response. "
27,"Things I've taken to family members out of state:

* An assortment of coffee and logo mugs from Zabar's
* Any of the NY-themed items from Fishs Eddy
* Tote bags and other logo merch from the Strand
"
28,"I did it for a few months. FUCK THAT. You basically are commuting half of your day. 

Wanna get home fast? Nope. 

In the winter its the worst. You wake up, see the sunrise on the train, and then see the sunset from your office. 

You watch stress about making train times. only to get there  and its delayed. 

I would move somewhere closer before i move that far out"
29,My presence is the gift.
30,"One thing nobody has seemed to mention, not sure if it's a selling point, but you'll find way more russians/culture in NYC than STL. That might end up being more important than you think."
31,"There's a few types. 

Firstly, the 90th street Jews. They wear green berets and quote only the last third of the Talmud when doing their Jewishness. These Jews are found on the corner of 34th street and Park Avenue. 

Secondly, there's all Jews below 42nd Street. They like the theatre sometimes but tend to live closer to the theatre district if they like the theatre more. Sometimes they live further away but still like the theatre. These Jews include the 90th street Jews. 

Thirdly, there's all Jews above 42nd street. They are similar to the Jews below 42nd street except they live in higher latitudes. 

Fourthly, there's the other Jews. They're not quite the same as all other Jews as they are all individuals. Some of them aren't Jews but also some of them are. 

Fifthly, there's the jewellery Jews. They're not Jews at all really. Rather, they're the sound you make when you start the word jewellery but before the finish the word. These shouldn't be confused with the ethnicity or religion as their Jewishness only comes from the pronunciation.

Fourthly, there's the dewy jewellery jury duelling druid Jews. These are wizards who congregate in groups of 12 and argumentatively pass judgment on others while their earrings are wet from condensation early in the morning. These Jews used to be known for their art as dewy jewellery jury duelling Druid Jews drew drawings of dreams on dreary jaunts during jury duty in June. 

Hope this helps. "
32,Go to Five Guys. You kind of have to.
