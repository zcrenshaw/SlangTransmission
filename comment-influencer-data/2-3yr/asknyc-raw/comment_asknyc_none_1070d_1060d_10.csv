0,RIP op.
1,"&gt; I refuse to help someone if I'm not an expert on an area.

The Last Honest Broker in New York City."
2,"When you are at a crosswalk, make you stand back a little bit. You can easily end up being splashed with disgusting a disgusting mixture of salt and slush. Also, make sure the cars come to a complete stop before crossing; the roads are deceptively slick and cars do slide  through stops signs and red lights."
3,"Good boots, good socks and a good flask.  "
4,[deleted]
5,Motion activated light will work wonders too.
6,Suspiciously fair.
7,Leave NYC. go far away to somewhere small and cheap. Start over. I suggest the south west. It is getting cold. 
8,[deleted]
9,"You need a consultation with a lawyer, not advice from random strangers on the internet."
10,Never trust a snowy patch of ground. Black ice or slush could be lurking underneath... Only step where others have already stepped.
11,"Get a good pair of boots and dress in layers that you can easily remove.

NYC winters aren't that bad - where are you from?"
12,"Love the little critter statues that hang out all over the 14th st and 8th Ave station. And the secret sound boxes in the 34th street herald square station. 

The new Fulton center, walking into the wtc oculus from there is very cool. "
13,"Go to a supermarket in a poor neighborhood, pay for people's groceries."
14,"My favorite stations in the system are the old below-grade, outdoor Q stops in Flatbush, with the 100 year old Beverley Road station being my favorite.  It's 99 years old, has an old-timey station house and great outdoor ironwork, and is on the national register of historic places.  With its third 'e', the spelling of the station name is antiquated and doesn't match the current street spelling.  So lots to like, as far as subway stations go."
15,"File a report with the police - preferably in the precinct where it happened.

Pretty sure the cops will not go out looking for him, but the guy does it a lot and enough similar reports are filed they may do something.

Otherwise, cancel your credit cards and all that.

"
16,"Your aunt is completely wrong about Hell's kitchen, lots of bars and restaurants and activity.  That would be a good neighborhood for you.  

You could also look uptown in Harlem. The Upper East Side would also work for you but it might be a little too boring.

If you are commuting by subway, being able to use an express line would make a big difference once you get farther out.

17,"Do normal people post on a fucking internet message board before they try to speak to other people?

Jesus fucking christ.

No, just don't talk to anyone.  Ever.  "
18,"You can actually get them directly from the Times.  I think they even come in a fancy plastic sleeve:

http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/backcopies.html

.. and Congratulations !"
19,Pizza isn't even food. I get pizza on my way to go eat. I can't quantify that shit.
20,Also slushy puddles look EXACTLY like black asphalt.  You'll end up ankle deep in one at some point or another.
21,"&gt; I know NYC isn't a wonderful place

NYC is the greatest city on earth. Go ask somewhere you haven't insulted the residents. Or just stay in Miami, if you can manage to stay away from all the crackhead dens there."
22,"I like to put together care kits sometimes and carry one or two with me in the winter to give out on my way to work. 

Gallon ziplock bag

Two pairs of new socks

A new Toothbrush

Toothpaste

Mini Mouthwash

A couple packs of handwarmers


Occasionally I'll throw some gloves or a hat in there. Sometimes a snack like m&amp;m or gummi bears or something. I think this year I'm gonna put a $5 Dunkin Donuts gift card in each one.

Is not really a bother to carry one of these packs a day or two a week, and it's always gone by time I get to work. "
23,"I don't think there are any neighborhoods you can buy in for that low price with the amenities you want. You will likely have to rent like most people. Also, your comments about the city are straight up ignorant. You should never be buying somewhere that you obviously know so little about. 

And fuck the Seahwks. "
24,"Glad to hear it's working out. In bushwick you have dollar oysters at moimenette and tutu's, awesome burgers at burger it up, Tony's pizza on deklab and knickerbocker is my favorite in the world. Robertas pizza isn't too far away, Archie's pizza does like a Hybrid ny/Midwest style of pizza that people love but I personally don't. MoMo sushi shack is probably the best sushi around, 983 has fantastic chicken and waffles, arrogant swine is a bit deeper into east Williamsburg for North Carolina style BBQ. "
25,"I've heard that homeless people (real ones, not the fake suspiciously clean and shaven panhandlers) really appreciate a good pair of warm socks, especially now when the weather is getting colder."
26,F
27,"The only thing that makes NYC different then anyplace else with winter is that you're dealing with massive salty puddles at corners when snow melts as well as slick ice on sidewalks.

SO - put vanity aside and look for boots of some kind with a good tread."
28,"Yes, but don't waste your time worrying about how they do it. Focus on your own budget."
29,My friend had the same thing happen to him. A few months later they called him and he came in and ID'd the guy in a line-up. The charge was larceny through deceit and intimidation. 
30, It's nice when people who ask a question report on the outcome - thanks!
31,The Strand is the obvious one. 
32,"BMT City Hall station. You've got an abandoned level, a missing plaque, and a mysterious door in the wall that may or may not lead to the last remaining part of Beach's Pneumatic subway.  "
33,"&gt; Only step where others have already stepped.

Disagree - as long as you have boots, snow that has not been walked on yet is usually less slippery and your foot gets a better grip on it."
34,You sound like you would be miserable here. You shouldn't move here.
35,"This.  If you put a fake camera, or a real one, they are cheap as shit these days, it will most likely solve the problem.  Take it a step farther and get a sign that says this entrance is monitored by video cameras and you will likely see much less people.  

The police emblem sticker Kid_Crown mentioned would probably help too.  

In general, you just want people to think twice.  A fucked up hobo high as shit is probably not thinking too straight, but some stupid kids and those kinds of people will likely avoid it if they think there will be trouble.  "
36,"Yeah, having your employer move you to New York City is a major step backwards -- sorry for your bad luck, that sucks amiright? "
