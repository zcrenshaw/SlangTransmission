0,Walking around in NYC even though you are surrounded by people you are alone
1,"1) As density of people increases, attention paid to any one person decreases. Anonymity in crowds. 

2) With a big enough population, there is ALWAYS someone weirder or crazier than you. I lived in DC and felt like I was in the top 5th percentile of weird. In NYC I don't even register on the scale.

3) I dislike 99.99% of people. In NYC, that still leaves many many thousands of people who I might actually like. And there's a community for every possible interest. "
2,Yes
3,"Tribeca itself isn't much of a hotspot for nightlife or a street scene. It's mostly desirable because of the stunning residential apartments, many made from old warehouses. Its location next to the Financial District, the West Village and Soho make it ideally placed for a wealthy resident who doesn't want to go far to work, to play, or to shop."
4,"I didn't know how to walk on stairs like an adult. Walked up the left side in midtown. Met by a guy in a hurry screaming ""RIGHT SIDE RIGHT SIDE."" Didn't understand, told him to go fuck himself. Called me a douchebag. Realized am douchebag. Now I walk on the stairs like an adult."
5,"Do not report to the Civilian Complain Board. It is useless, go to your gfs community board website and contact the community liaison person. Believe me, it is way more effective. "
6,"trust me, dude, New York is a very, very, very gay friendly city. Even if a lot of people came specifically for pride, this is one of the most gay friendly cities out there. It's practically *cool* to be gay. "
7,"The negative stigma around new comers is, in part, the starry-eyed ""I'm gonna be the one that makes it!"" They do all kinds of obnoxious, stupid stuff; drive up rent; don't get subway or sidewalk etiquette; they complain about things that are good about the city because they don't get it yet and the love things that are horrible about the city because they don't get it yet. 

They're just noobs, man. There isn't any real shame in it; it's just what happens. Being a noob anywhere is the same - lurk more, post less. Read social cues; pay attention; don't be a dick; admit your newness without bragging about it; try to fit in rather than change the thing to fit you. "
8,"Let's use CityPASS as an example:

At $116pp, Admission Includes

**1 The Empire State Building Experience**

**2 American Museum of Natural History**

**3 The Metropolitan Museum of Art**

**4 Top of the Rock Observation Deck   OR   Guggenheim Museum**

**5 Statue of Liberty &amp; Ellis Island   OR   Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises**

**6 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum   OR   Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum**

Natural History and the Met are pay what you wish.  You can give as little as a dollar, though, you are encouraged to give more.  Empire is $32.  You'll have to choose between the Guggenheim and Top of the Rock.  The more expensive is Top of the Rock at $32.  Covering 1 - 4, we're at $66.

Statue of Liberty is $25 or Circle Line is $33.  9/11 seems to be about $24 and Intrepid is $26.  

If you chose the most expensive option every time, your max savings is $9.  If you really want to do all of these things, then maybe it's worth it.  however, if you don't take full advantage, the pass will cost you more.

"
9,Drop off wash and fold would be #1 for me  I don't use anything fancy- Just the local family run spot on my block.
10,I learned the empty subway car hazard real fucking quick. 
11,"Yeah. It's nice being in a crowd, but not having to talk to anyone."
12,"Side note re: ""pay what you wish"" museums ... obviously this sub isn't monolithic, and different people are in different threads, but I can't help but notice that people in other threads say ""it's pay what you wish - if you live here, don't pay, let tourists subsidize you,"" and in this thread, people are telling a tourist the same thing. Doesn't anyone think that someone should pay to see an amazing museum? Are y'all really that cheap? 

OP, def go to those museums; they're amazing. But if you have the money to travel here from overseas, please consider a substantial donation in return for the incredible collections inside. 

**Edit:** whoa, a lot more people on Reddit on this July Fourth than I expected. Cheers to you all and thanks for the interesting discussion!

To be clear, I just intended to say that people of means (which means most tourists, IMO) should pay what they can for these incredible collections. Again, enjoying the conversation!"
13,"It is entirely possible that someone's asshole did explode.   

I feel like that stop always smells like that on hot summer days though.   "
14,"when were you walking through it? since tribeca's been taken over by wealthy families, they were probably all in the hamptons this weekend."
15,"I hate people and I hate pretending to enjoy social events. I have 2 close friends, a girlfriend and an amazing dog. I'm set. 

But I love the city because of the hustle and bustle. There's always something to do on your own. Ironically, a city of 8+ million is the perfect place for a loner. 

"
16,"You shouldn't worry about it. While it's overreaching to say every single resident in NYC is an ally, the social climate of the city in general is very gay friendly. And yes, while there are a shit ton of gay people within the city, plenty of people visit during Pride. If you want a better idea of the local gay community, go out on a weekend night to the bars and clubs of Hell's Kitchen."
17,tree fiddy
18,"Proximity to Manhattan (especially lower Manhattan) with less of the bustle. Some unique character and culture, though it's been more homogenized in recent years. Very safe. Good variety of bars and restaurants. "
19,"When I was in 7th grade we took a day trip there after studying immigration or whatever.  I found a tin whistle in the gift shop that sounded cool and was playing the Voyage of the Mimi theme song on it and missed the call to get on the ferry to go back to Manhattan.  My class left without me, didn't realize it until they got back, and my social studies teacher Mrs. Schwartz had to get on the ferry again to come get me.  She was really really mad.  It messed the whole day up, schedule-wise, for everybody.  I think we were supposed to go do something else that had to be canceled.  So we had this silent ferry ride back, just the two of us, her quietly fuming.

Anyway, that probably isn't very helpful info unless you're looking for a tin whistle.  It may still be there (this was twenty years ago).  Good luck!"
20,Sleep No More. 
21,"Fuck that, the real trip is when you go somewhere quiet and literally can't sleep at all because the quiet is fucking terrifying."
22,"I think a lot of people that move here feel that way about NYC, but man, you  haven't ""fallen into the rhythm of the city"" - it takes years to do that in a real and meaningful way. And just the statement ""walking down a sketchy street at the wrong hour"" makes me roll my eyes. You just don't even know what you don't know, so you gotta avoid conclusory statements like that if you don't want to get the noob reaction.

Good luck, man."
23,Do not do this. This is extremely illegal. 
24,"Also the ""I worked my ass off to get here"" attitude doesn't play well, I work my ass off to eat I don't give a shit what you've done."
25,"I might be in the minority, but I completely ignore votes and read the NYC subreddits sorted by New, so I hadn't noticed. "
26,"Okay, so I'm going to say some things that may or may not be true for you, but are my impression as someone who works as a dev in NYC, and knowing almost nothing about you.

The preference for local tech talent is mild, most companies - funded startups to BigCorps alike - are more than happy to relocate someone, and look further afield than the city for people.

If you're not having much luck hearing back from companies you've applied to, my suspicion is that it's more an issue with your resume, experience, or approach than it is with the fact that you live in Seattle.

Which is also to say that if this is true, moving here will only make it marginally easier to find a job. It's 2016, you're a software engineer, if companies aren't beating down your door with a battering ram odds are you're not marketing yourself correctly, and that's the root issue rather than where you live right now.

I would say your financial situation makes moving here jobless not a completely insane plan - it's much more reasonable than the ""I just graduated high school and I'm plucky and have a dream"" posts we get sometimes :P

But again, my suspicion as someone in your field in NYC is that there are more fundamental issues with your job search process than simply not being local. The good news is ""marketing yourself wrong"" is eminently fixable."
27,"Huge weekend for tourism. Nothing will be closed, but everything will be mobbed. "
28,I thought this was a circle jerk post. 
29,"I hate people, but I like individuals. As someone far wiser than I once said, ""A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it."""
30,"I met Ben Stiller shortly after I arrived here, we chatted for a while and he was really nice! After we parted, he called my name and I turned around to see him extending his arm out towards with a thumbs up to say ""WELCOME TO NEW YORK CITY, SWORDOFBARSOOM!""


Honestly, living here ain't so bad. Cost of living is higher but so is pay, I live a pretty comparable life of comfort as I did in the Midwest living with my SO, only now I'm in NYC and there's so much more to do, so much more to eat.  "
31,"The Met. It's way bigger than MOMA, you can spend all day in there are there's so much beautiful and well known artwork. Met is also pay what you can, which is great if you're poor like me. I also wasn't all that excited by the current exhibits at the MOMA either, but obviously that's one opinion. "
32,What type of job would you be applying for? It's obviously virtually impossible to guess what your earning potential might be based solely on your resume without any indication of what you would do with it. 
33,"I've compiled the ""Best of"" responses to ""Best rooftop bars"" and ""Best rooftop views."" I've tagged the original contributors in case they have anything to add to their original posts:

 /u/shockerzzz87 &amp; /u/themadtinfoilhatter : not ""secret"" but feels private, i know that since ive had a wonderful time with my bf there. its near grand central, a roof top park like things thats open for all. go at night… the rooftop of [Zengo](http://www.richardsandoval.com/zengony/). It's a popular picnic lunch spot: http://goo.gl/maps/LW8DD

/u/scrodytheroadie : At the top of La Quinta Inn in Koreatown is a really low key rooftop bar with a great view of the Empire State Building. It used to be called Mé Bar, but now it's something else - standby, googling - [VU Rooftop](http://www.vunyc.com/). Nice quiet place to catch up with friends

/u/umbrellasinjanuary : [The Press Lounge](https://www.thepresslounge.com/) is the best rooftop in the city. [Upstairs at the Kimberly](http://upstairsnyc.com/) is a close second.

/u/Carwheel : I'm a huge fan of the Library Bar on [top of the Library Hotel near Bryant Park](http://www.hospitalityholdings.com/#/establishments/bookmarks) 

/u/FirstLadyOfBeer : [Wythe hotel](http://wythehotel.com/the-ides/) in Williamsburg. Go during the week and enjoy some good cocktails while overlooking Manhattan

/u/elye : ...My personal favorite is the [rooftop bar at the Refinery Hotel](http://www.refineryhotelnewyork.com/refinery-rooftop) on 38th and 6th.

/u/Figureddo : [Blue Bottle Coffee on the Highline](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/cafes/high-line)

/u/stilettonyc : [Salon De Ning](http://newyork.peninsula.com/en/fine-dining/salon-de-ning-rooftop-bar). Peninsula Hotel. They provide warm blankets and heaters...Pricey drinks but well worth it.

/u/lyra1227 : Not a rooftop bar, but has a really nice view of the city anyway: http://gaonnurinyc.com/ 

/u/disposableNYC : The [empire hotel](http://www.empirehotelnyc.com/eat-and-drink.html) has a pool. Friends of mine sneak in all the time. Just make up a room number and head up confidently.

/u/coasts : so, you want it all, huh? [the bar at the La Quinta](http://www.vunyc.com/) on 32nd bet. 5th &amp; 6th meets all of your criteria but the last. the drinks are regular. nothing special at all. great view of ESB, no dress code, and very relaxed. [Press Lounge](https://www.thepresslounge.com/) at the Ink Hotel was laid back when I was there years ago. Can't say what it's like now.

/u/flat_top : [Brass monkey](http://brassmonkeynyc.com/brass-monkey-rooms/) on non weekend nights

/u/ilouiei : [pod 39](http://www.thepodhotel.com/pod-hotel-entertainment/) happy hour isn't bad

/u/rvdsn : [Rare Rooftop](http://www.rarebarandgrill.com/location/rare-view-murray-hill/) *Note: Also in [Chelsea](http://www.rarebarandgrill.com/location/rare-view-chelsea/)*

/u/sonofaresiii : I can't afford most rooftop bars, so there may be better suggestions... but a pretty nice one is on top of Penn Station at 33rd and 8th. There's actually one on each side, above the block-long Duane Reade. One's called Lulu's, don't remember the other one's name, but I like the one that's NOT lulu's better. *NOTE: I think this refers to [Local](http://www.localcafenyc.com/) or [Rock &amp; Reilly's](http://www.newyorkrenaissance.com/dining/)*

/u/sokpuppet1 : [The Delancey](http://thedelancey.com/#home1) has a rooftop. The Standard has an outdoor area but is pricey *NOTE: [Free penthouse concerts](http://www.standardhotels.com/new-york/features/Annie-O-Live-Music-Series-Standard-East-Village)*. ~~Above Allen~~ [Tiki Tabu](http://www.sixtyhotels.com/lower-east-side/eat-drink/) at the SIXTY Lower East Side.

/u/MonkeyScales : The Heath has great food, a 20s vibe, live music and a rooftop bar called [The Gallow Greens](http://www.mckittrickhotel.com/gallow-green/).

/u/OscyPoscy : There's an amazing rooftop on Eldridge Street, opposite the $1 dumpling shop. There's an internet cafe on the floor below. Make out like you're heading there, and just keep on going past. Beautiful views of downtown and the bridges.

/u/notpeter : There's a rooftop deck on the south west corner of [the met](http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/met-fifth-avenue). It's not terribly high, but because it's in the park you can see lots of the city.

/u/soy_sauce_sucks : The [NYLO hotel](http://www.nylohotels.com/nyc/locl-bar-new-york-dining-4-9.aspx) (UWS) has a top floor/roof deck that anyone can access - 16th floor I think. BYOB as well which is nice

/u/callmesnake13 : If this is where you're going to ask this question then they probably aren't letting you in… When you go to the [Boom Boom Room](http://www.standardhotels.com/new-york/features/top-of-the-standard) it's literally just models and trust fund kids in there.

/u/BrokelynNYC : [Top of the standard](http://www.standardhotels.com/new-york/features/top-of-the-standard) is my favorite. So nice. Reminds me of gatsby. [le Bain](http://www.standardhotels.com/new-york/features/le-bain) is next door. easier to get in and just as nice.

/u/lilwaynker : [Catch](http://catchrestaurants.com/catchroof/) and [PHD](http://phdlounge.com/)

/u/filipv : I'm really fond of [Bar 54](http://timessquare.hyatt.com/en/hotel/dining/lounge.html) on Hyatt Times Square. Pricey though.

/u/littlepinkpig : [Rooftop at the Gansevoort](http://www.gansevoorthotelgroup.com/hotels/gansevoort-park-avenue-nyc/nightlife/gansevoort-park-rooftop-549/) is quintessential Meatpacking

/u/CharethCutestorie : [Top of the Strand](http://www.topofthestrand.com/) in midtown has cool ESB views, and isn't as ""scene-y"" as the Meatpacking spots.

/u/PigeonProwler : I don't know how the scene is usually, but we happened upon [Sanctuary at Haven](http://www.havenrooftop.com/) around 3am this March (it's covered in the winter) and found it to be pretty awesome. Granted, in the summer the crowd might be a terrifying mix of douchebags and tourists, but it's worth a shot.

/u/Bad_Sex_Advice : [Sky Room](http://skyroomnyc.com/) is relatively cheap, it's a 2 level lounge bar, usually not too packed and they make strong drinks.

/u/volcanicflamingo : The rooftop bar at the [Kimberly Hotel](http://upstairsnyc.com/) is kind of a swanky place, not too expensive or crowded, and they have some tasty snacks. Some people gripe a lot about the service but I've never had any trouble. My friend mentioned that the staff might all be models, and not professionally service people so that could explain it.

/u/luxdesigns : [The Whitney Museum](http://whitney.org/Visit/Dining) is free if you're under 18, and has some great views! Especially at dusk. It's 8 stories high, and overlooks the High Line Park.

/u/MilgramHarlow : The rooftop of [New Design High School](http://www.newdesignhigh.com/our-rooftop/) is incredible. I'm not sure how accessible it is to people unless you're renting it for something.

/u/craigalanche : I own this place http://williamsburgschoolofmusic.net and have a big roof. Drop me a pm if you want.

/u/halfbakedpotatoes : Check out [Northern Territory](http://www.northernterritorybk.com/) in Greenpoint

[deleted] : [Penthouse 808](http://penthouse808rooftop.com/) has a great view and is definitely cheaper than the Wythe Hotel. 

/u/HanumanMan : Check out [The Jane hotel](http://www.thejanenyc.com/). They have a club downstairs but the rooftop is available to rent. It was also well priced from experience.

/u/sanddobby : This may not be what you're looking for but the [New Museum](http://www.newmuseum.org/spacerental) has a beautiful public rooftop deck. I went near closing time and it was basically deserted.

/u/ypsidon : Lots of hotels have good rooftop spots. [Six Columbus](http://www.sixtyhotels.com/six-columbus/eat-drink/) is nice. 

/u/FrankiePoops : Price range and is view a priority or is it just outdoor space that you want? If pricey is okay, the [Mad 46 Rooftop](http://www.mad46.com/defaultdb2c.html?pg=about) is pretty sweet.

/u/thatssomanhattan : … [The Dream Downtown](http://phdlounge.com/) has a great view too. Lots of other rooftop bars, but they're all a little uppity. [Belvedere Castle](http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/belvedere-castle.html) in Central Park doesn't really count as a rooftop, but there's a view.

/u/nyc_food : [Alma](http://almarestaurant.com/) is my go to. Lots of stairs and no elevator though, if anyone has a hard time with them avoid.

/u/DC25NYC : Check out [Spyglass](http://www.spyglassnyc.com/), I know they have food but again if you're more in it for the meal try Fabrick which is the restaurant below it. Also the [James Hotel rooftop](http://www.jameshotels.com/new-york/bar-lounge/jimmy) is great for drinks and sunset with david burke kitchen downstairs."
