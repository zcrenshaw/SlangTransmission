0,"I would say not favorable, not even within the Jewish community but for different reasons. My personal opinion: they are racist, homophobes, sexist, drive like shit and they act like they own the neighborhoods they live in, they have moved bus stops signs to accommodate their parking needs, they use and abuse welfare more than any other community in NY and they are probably the worst landlords on earth. 

So that's that. "
1,"The reason people do this is just a way for them to try to assert their fragile sense of new found masculinity.  They're generally daring you to say something, so they can get into a scuffle with you.  It's annoying, but I get the need to feel powerful when you're a kid that's probably had it pretty hard.  

Not worth your time, your ego or your teeth to fight with these kids."
2,"First rule of the subway is ignore and suffer through it. 

Change cars if it bothers you that bad. "
3,I've noticed quite the opposite. I've seen more Canada Goose jackets this year than ever before.
4,"Unscrupulous cabbies used to charge exorbitant flat fees, or take wildy circuitous routes to run up the meter. The TLC instituted the flat rate, to protect the consumer from fraud. + now you  get the bonus of not having to pay for heavy traffic."
5,"My friend and I asked a woman and man to turn it down on the platform at 4am last week. They ignored us. So we looked up gay porn and blasted the audio. Not only did they walk away from us  mortified, they put in headphones. üëçüèº"
6,"Many New Yorkers have unfavorable views, but I feel that people are hesitant to talk about it, not wanting to sound anti-semetic."

8,"The stereotypical knock against Murray Hill is that it's where you rent your first parent-subsidized apartment if you've just moved to the city after graduating from a school that actually cares about football and are trying to hang onto the Best Years Of Your Life by living with two of your frat brothers or sorority sisters in a one-bedroom flex.

It's full of people who would probably be happier in a garden apartment outside Charlotte but want to brave a few winters trying to break into finance or fashion (read: reception or retail) before heading back to SEC country.

It's the antithesis of quiet, and unless your buddy likes college-town bars with Woo! girls and cheap shots, it sounds like he'd be happier a few stops into Brooklyn. The quaint brownstone neighborhoods are notoriously expensive, but plenty of my friends have found larger places for less money there than most people pay in Murray Hill. "
9,"Many New Yorkers don't have a favorable opinion of them due to high profile criminal incidents, but most New Yorkers by far never interact with them due to the insular nature of Hasidic communities. Unless you live near one of their neighborhoods or walk through the diamond district, you're unlikely to even see them.

As I Jew I have to confess that every time I see the headline of ""Slumlord accused of..."" I pray a little that it's not one of us. But more often than not you see their photo splashed on the Post and lo and behold, it's a Hasidic Jew. Makes all of us look bad because some may start to equate these very noticeable and identifiable guys (and I do mean guys) with Judaism writ large.

I'm sure they're mostly good people, I don't know any, but their sour apples sure do give many people a unfavorable impression of them. 

The Amish are not an apt comparison, besides for the fact that they keep to their own communities. "
10,"The harshest comments I've heard about hasidim came from my Jewish coworkers.

11,Doesn't mean we can't bitch about how rude they are 
12,"There is no positive outcome to fighting a crazy homeless person.  Unfortunate this guy's keyed in on you.   But it's just random and the dude is just crazy.   Could you have moved, sure but I've been in similar positions and not moved and never been hit. 

Another cautionary tale.  Be careful.  Keep your guard up and I guess maybe consider moving when crazy people are near.  "
13,It's not that cold yet. Wait a few weeks.

15,Panhandling within X # of feet of a bank or ATM is considered aggressive panhandling and they could be arrested.

18,"It looks like a small two way street, judging by the parked cars and the traffic light below the illumined sign. I'm not convinced it's a NYSC sign on that building. And going by the windows, not the one on 7th ave. 

Any EXIF data on the photo?
It's got to be downtown somewhere... 

EDIT: I'm pretty sure was [Marinella Restaurant at 49 Carmine Street](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7299039,-74.0039906,3a,56.9y,15.58h,87.59t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sHiKZb-Tk1dF0kh7B9y3m1Q!2e0!5s20070901T000000!7i3328!8i1664). Closed in 2013 after 27 years of business. [Here's an old interior picture. Perfect match.](http://images.nymag.com/listings/restaurant/2marinella.jpg) "
19,"I also used to live in SF, and actually originally from San Jose, where there is an even bigger Vietnamese presence.

First, the good news. There's tons of good ramen in NYC.

Totto's ramen is paitan ramen, made with chicken. If you're looking for tonkotsu soup made with pork bones, you're barking up the wrong tree. I also quite dislike it, so I'm in agreement with you there. Haven't been to Ichiran, but it seems like all the hype is around the solo dining booths, not the ramen itself.

Get your ass to Ippudo. It's virtually at the top of everyone's list of ""good ramen"" and for good measure. Dinner lines are nuts, but lunch is more manageable. 

Other ones in NYC I'd recommend: 

* Hide-Chan in Midtown East

* Mu Ramen in LIC

* Ramen Yebisu in Williamsburg (this one isn't as well known nor does it get as rave reviews, but I personally like it)

* Ramen Lab in Nolita (this is a ""lab"" that hosts a constantly rotating lineup of pop-up ramen restaurants, each one usually from another US or Japanese city, pretty dope concept, but check their site to see who is currently there)

The bad news. Pho, and Vietnamese food in general, is not that great in NYC. My theory is that there just isn't a large Vietnamese community in NYC, and most Vietnamese restaurants are actually run by Chinese-Vietnamese people. You can tell since all the staff speak Cantonese to each other‚ÄîI rarely hear Vietnamese at these places. You are definitely not finding a Tenderloin (or San Jose) quality bowl of pho for $8. Some pho places that I'm willing to hit up if I do have a pho craving:

* Saigon Shack in the West Village (bit fancier than what you're used to in the TL, $10.95 for the big bowl of pho with ""the works"" cuts of meat)

* Pho Bang and Pho Grand in Chinatown (these two have that grimey hole-in-the-wall feel, if that matters to you)

* Sao Mai in the East Village (has a bigger Vietnamese menu, pho is pretty decent)

* Thai Son - I haven't had the pho here but I've had their other dishes and they were pretty good. Worth checking out their pho, I'd say.

Let me know what you think if you ever hit any of these up. NYC's a great ramen city, but I definitely get my legit pho fix every time I go back to the Bay Area."
20,"People working in the tunnels. Believe it or not, they prefer not to be hit by a train while working so the horns help give them a heads up."
21,"I had asked a kid who was playing with a portable speaker that had really poor quality to turn down his music/use headphones.   
It was a rush hour train, and He said something to the effect of ""I won't do that unless you give me the money for headphones"" - I took out and offered my own headphones, which he did not take, and a few other people on the train offered as well. He just seemed like a kid who just thought that people noticing him, no matter for what, made him ""cool""."
22,"Getting up and moving might have also triggered the guy.

A good tip is getting off at the next stop, then moving to the next train over or waiting for the next train altogether.  It looks natural like you were always going to depart at that stop.  Whereas moving to a different part of the same train makes it clear you were avoiding the guy."
23,"These fucks are economic vagrants. They have a SRO or assisted living arrangements and usually some kind of disability benefits but instead of being productive, they beg in absurd ways and turn sympathetic people into skeptics. 

All my life in NYC, real homeless people rarely walk up to you and ask for money. They are busy watching their stuff and leave a cup out in front of them for some change."
24,"This is something where I might write a letter to my community board or go to one of the meetings where police representatives attend.

I wouldn't make it about your neighbors. I wouldn't mention the kinds of cars. I would simply say that on X street there is a consistent problem with double parked cars, traffic being blocked during snow plow time, and just general poor parking behavior and ask if they can better enforce parking laws there. "
25,Hometown BBQ in Red Hook is pretty great.
26,"I've been to Roosevelt Island once, a number of years ago.  I find the entire place unsettling, sort of like The Village from The Prisoner."
27,"Rent a u haul or zip van. Definitely don't lose out on this good deed because no one else is willing to help. It'll be that much extra satisfying. 

Good luck

A good deed is not that is easily done"
28,John Brown's in Long Island City
29,good luck calling the cops for noise on nye ;)
30,"Yes, this is not a smart idea. Our homeless shelters are at capacity, and as a single person you will not have priority over families. Living on the streets in Oklahoma in the summer is no comparison to being homeless in the winter in NYC. 

You know what's a really nice way to experience new things and people? By earning money to do whatever the fuck you want in life. Good luck."
31,"Lots of neighborhoods have small grocery stores and markets within a half mile, most people don't do their grocery shopping in one fell swoop though. I tend to grab one-2 bags of groceries a few times a week on my way home from work, most other people are the same.

Although I am totally guilty of waiting till the last minute and then ubering home with 50 million boxes of cereal.

Also, I wouldn't go so far as to say ""most"" people get their groceries delivered, but tons and tons do. "
32,"Porto Rico, off 6th Ave on Bleeker st. "
33,"Am Jewish, fuck the Hasidics. Fuck all hyper-religious communities."
