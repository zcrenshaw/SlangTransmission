0,I put my phone to video mode in my pocket and get ready to press record and scream WORLDSTAR.
1,"This was on the LIRR. 

It was late on a Saturday, on the Babylon line.

Conductor: this is the 12:48 to Babylon. for the sober among you, the next stop is Forest Hills. For everyone else, I'll see you in Babylon. "
2,"Lots of clubs, lots of dancing, great drugs, lots of venues for live music (all over Manhattan), beautiful people from all over the world, people from America moved here not just for jobs but to be away from whatever shit they were leaving behind, food was great and no one stood on line for donuts dipped in soy sauce or something absurd like that, book stores, bands worked at their music and didn't blow up overnight. Decent delicatessens and they weren't insanely expensive. Very good diners open 24 hours.

NYC was like the internet before the internet existed: if whatever you were looking for wasn't in NYC, then it wasn't anywhere in the US. It was either here in NYC, or it was where it was made - but no where else, and people came from all over the world to got to particular stores to buy things they couldn't fine elsewhere. We had stores that had interesting stuff, and those stores didn't need to sell a million dollars a month in merchandise to stay open. Now it's all restaurants, bars, and a shit-ton of ""fast-casual"" eateries. Flea markets and street vendors had amazing stuff, and the flea markets weren't ""curated"" with pre-approved wares like they are today taking all of the fun and surprise out of it.

Lot more older people. Certain neighborhoods today have almost no older folks that were once full of them. Those people past away and their apartments were emptied out and lot of great stuff ended up on the street or at consignment shops which you could sift through.

Things didn't need to be hyper-sanitized like they are today."
3,"&gt; my father has told me he would be able to support me

This is how you afford to live in NYC."
4,"&gt; You will be surrounded by Asian tourists and screaming Elmos engulfed in a torrent of French accents and fat pensioners from Arkansas.

FTFY

Edit: spelling"
5,"Yeah, Reddit."
6,"Things I do when I don't feel like partying: Watch a movie, go see a comedy show, go to a chill music event, hang with friends, or my favorite is accidentally staying up until 4 am playing overwatch."
7,"one time i was riding the J train over the williamsburg bridge and the conductor just went into full tour guide mode. it was awesome.

""to your left is the brooklyn bridge, opened in 1883 -- to your right is roosevelt island!"" et cetera. some cool history facts, talked a bit about some manhattan landmarks, all while talking reeeaaaally fucking fast so he could fit it all in while we were still on the bridge.

2nd place would be the time some guy was holding the door open on the C train. there was no one on the platform so it wasn't like he was waiting for someone who was running up, it didn't make any sense. conductor waits, then runs the computer voice ""stand clear of the closing doors please"" like 4x in a row and this dude is still holding the door open. so the conductor gets on there and SCREAMS ""HEY MAN GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE DOOR!!!"" we pulled out of the station about a second later."
8,"Live in Queens or Brooklyn. Live with housemates. Take the subway everywhere (and never use Lyft/Uber). Cook as much at home as you can. I don't find NYC expensive except for the rent. Everything else (eating out, going to the cinema etc.) is optional.

Also, do you have a job lined up yet? I moved to NYC when I had an internship lined up in publishing, and even after that internship, I was searching for a job for 4 months before I found a paying gig at a literary agency (and that was applying to jobs every day and contacting editors personally). Four months doesn't seem that long but when you're out of work and need to pay rent, it can be tough :-/"
9,"From the last time this question was posted...  
&gt; 225th St. on the 1. ""Connection available to a gypsy cab in front of Target.""
"
10,"An old man in a wheelchair being pushed by his blind wife while he yelled instructions to her, as they were jaywalking across 42nd street during rush hour."
11,"I'm an asshole, not a monster."
12,"Socialize. Go out every night. Pick an avenue in Manhattan and walk one or two hundred blocks-- walk back, notice how the light has changed and it feels like a totally different place.

Go to Times Square. Ignore the lights for a moment, and just listen. You will be surrounded by pilgrims from all over the world."
13,"&gt; I find a lot of the guys to be too bro-y and mainstream, and then the ones who are looking for more serious relationships seem to be on the fast track to suburban McMansion hell (they might not put it that way, ha).

The best approach to dating is to let go of judgments and focus on understanding what you want, and making sure you're doing what you need to in order to achieve it. I hate to break it to you, but if you're looking to get married and have children, and you're used to growing up in a surburban setting, you're also on the ""fast track to suburban McMansion hell"", you're just in denial about it. If you have an idea of where you'd like to settle when you have kids, you need to figure out if moving to NYC is right for meeting someone that shares that idea of where your family will be rooted. If you don't like that, then maybe re-evaluate what you want. 

I don't think dating in NYC is all that bad, but you need to really be okay with being single (as in, you already like your life) and sticking true to what you want. If you want a spouse, you need to make that clear and upfront in your actions. Don't delude yourself in casually dating, thinking that's somehow going to magically attract the right guy. Be picky about the important things, and much less so on the unimportant ones. Good luck.

14,"""We are delayed due to incompetent supervision."""
15,"I know I've told this one before, but the day before Thanksgiving, the A-train announcer took advantage of the long express haul between 125th and 59th Street, telling us all not to show up empty handed on Thanksgiving. Instead, we should go to the store today, get an Entenmann's cake, take it home, whip up some homemade frosting, put it in a Tupperware, and not answer any questions about whether you really made that delicious cake.

I've never seen a train car come together in a wave of emotions from ""Aww"" to ""What?"" to ""...This is brilliant."""
16,all subway stations smell like shit
17,Yes. Work in surgery
18,You only order an Irish car bomb at an Irish bar if you're a douchebag. It's called a guiness and a shot of baileys. How'd you like people ordering a 9/11?
19,"Yeah, the amount you can afford to replace if it gets damaged.  "
20,"Just walk aimlessly and take it all in. No headphones, just listen and look. If you like architecture, really pay attention to the buildings and how different they are. Think of the history behind them and the lives that were lived in them and experienced walking down the streets. This is greatly heightened if you like taking pictures. Even with an iPhone, you can see some great juxtapositions of design or views. 

Notice the shifts in neighborhood characteristics as you go. If you don't stop to pay attention, it all seems like city jumble but they have distinct characteristics and you'll see how the have their own vibes. Stop at little coffee shops, grab quick bites, or a quick drink on your journey. 

Most other places you'll go from here won't have walking as this viable of an option with so much to see. 

That's the simple; next is my (very incomplete) quick list. A lot of it involves drinking because, well, I like drinking and have done a considerable amount during my time here. Anyway:

SI Ferry ride at sunset; Boat Basin; Riverside Park around 103; Coney Island; Citi Field; a rooftop bar (The Skylark or 230 5th are two options); St. Luke's (little hidden park); NYPL; Chrysler Building Lobby; walk the Brooklyn Bridge and Brooklyn Promenade; Roosevelt Island Tram; Jimmy's Corner, Double Down, or 7B for old NYC dive bars (tons of options, but a few of my favorites); Dead Rabbit, Little Branch, or Employees Only for crazy cocktails; Whispering Wall (and, fuck, just admiring) Grand Central; Subway Museum; Zinc Bar or Birdland for awesome jazz music; Rockwood for free music; Katz Deli for overpriced (but good) corned beef or pastrami; Murray's or Leo's for bagels; any number of good, fine dining restaurants that fit your tastes; jog along the Hudson River Park (sunset is awesome); Wave Hill in the Bronx; Inwood Park; City Island; Rockaway Beach; and Times Square at night. 

I'm gonna stop, but not because I'm out of things. I'm tired and, well, that's a lot already. 

Good luck exploring. This place is amazing and, as much as it can wear on me and I can hate it, I've yet to not smile and be in awe when I see the skyline when I come back after being away."
21,"The toughest part about dating in NYC is that there are so many choices, which leads people to pretty much behave in the flightiest way by default.

This is particularly troubling for the ladies, since the demographics tip in the men's favor in terms of sheer numbers.  But numbers alone don't tell the whole story.  According to numerous women I've talked to about this (and I've had a lllllllottttttt of conversations about this) the actual toughest part of dating here isn't the quantity, it's the quality.

Back in my single days (before 2014) I was meeting people both online and IRL and it could only be described as an embarrassment of riches.  I could literally walk outside a bar, toss a rock in the air and it would land on an attractive, motivated, employed, interesting, funny woman.  It is tough not to find one, they're honestly everywhere.

For women, however, the opposite is sometimes true.  The number of stories I heard from my female friends about guys they went on dates with who were ""in between jobs"" or not really motivated by anything, or expecting her to do the lion's share of work in the relationship, etc. is pretty astounding.

So taking that into account, the numbers don't really tell the whole story.  I spent my single years here finding the perfect woman.  My wife spent those same years managing her expectations.  (Now that I type that, I seriously hope that I'm the exception to all of that.)

All that being said, there are amazing people here of all genders who are definitely looking for a commitment.  I wouldn't be worried about finding someone if that's what you're looking for and you stay focused on that."
22,"Let go of your dreamland and focus on reality. This city is in constant flux and that's one of the many reasons it draws people in. Holding onto a nostalgia that you didn't even experience will lead nowhere good. The Village hasn't been an affordable place for poor artists in over two decades.

There are plenty of creative people here, but if you're expecting them to align with some fantasy you've built up, you may be missing them entirely. Focus more on being involved in events that cater to the people you'd like to surround yourself with and you will make your own NYC story."
23,Woke up to a text an hour ago saying the office is open. I went back to sleep. 
24,"St. Patrick's Cathedral is both holy and awesome, and likely near empty"
25,"Critical infrastructure maintenance and operation for a large data center. It's mostly because my boss is actually a crazy person. I also work an hour upstate, I was worried about the bridge being closed."
26,"My friend Juan lives in Astoria and I think he's Mexican but I'm not totally sure. If he is then he's definitely the best Mexican. Cool dude.

If you want restaurants and not my friend Juan then the only answer is Casa Enrique. Definitely a place to go if you're looking to impress. The place has a well deserved Michelin Star but at the same time it won't break the bank. Two people for less then $100 for sure."
27,"two manhattans and some saudi hash, please."
28,"More small businesses, less Starbucks, way more aggressive homeless people and a lot more street level violence."
29,"If it's purposeful, then you have grounds to file vandalism or destruction of property charges (or whatever the legal term is)

If it's accidental, you'd be a dick to do anything but take the jacket to a tailor to have it fixed. And if it's not repairable, well that's a risk you take for walking around in a $1K jacket. If you didn't want to risk that, don't walk around outside next to people where you could accidentally bump into someone or something and tear it. Shit happens. "
30,"Oh, another hero is the conductor who said something like, ""Don't trust the robot voice. This is Kos-key-os-ko Street, not Kosh-yew-sko. The robots are not our friends."""
31,I'm just going to say that I know a lot of people in my age group that get ALOT of help from their parents.
32,"Way back in the 90s, one of the conductors said, ""transfer here to the B train, B as in bad boy Bobby Brown."" "
33,"I was on the 7 train once and a conductor said something along the lines of, ""To the pretty girl with the nice smile who asked me for directions, you need to get off at the next stop."""
34,"In a very cold, barely controlled rage: If the woman. In the third car. Doesn't get her TERRIBLE weave out of the door. Then so help me God, I will make every last person get off of this train. Make. The. Right. Decision. "
35,"The 80's followed by the 90's. Going to illegal clubs and dance parties, witnessing the early roots of hip hop. The sub culture experiences, train parties, after hour clubs, Bear parties, Jackie 60, hellfire, the vault, opera in Central Park, cbgb's all the fun in vacant lots when you crawl through the hole in the fence.

Witnessing a cop riot in the 80's changed my life so there's that. "
36,The elevator is her office.
37,"""Oh shit. They took the ATM out of this bar? Please. Like taking the ATM out is gonna stop people buying drugs in here."""
38,"Queens bound, ""ARRRRRRR"" train!! (in pirate voice)"
39,Don't forget to turn your phone horizontal.
40,Are you kidding me every 2 bit hardware store in NYC will cut the keys to heaven if you ask them. If you go to a no name hardware store in any borough they will cut any key for you.
41,There's one conductor on the J who will give the history of the Williamsburg Bridge when we cross over into Brooklyn and point out buildings in the skyline. He's the best.
