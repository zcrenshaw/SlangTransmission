0,"The chupacabra's vision is largely motion based; find a shelter before sundown, and try to stay as still as you can."
1,"All good, used the Starbucks on 4th.  Had to buy some chips"
2,"1980-1990s, Manhattan: More prostitutes and drug dealers being less obvious about their wares. More empty storefronts or shitty stores. More details about particular neighborhoods: 

* We powerwalked the shit out of 42nd St. It was not a good place to linger.

* SoHo Broadway, especially the lower end toward Canal, was mostly shuttered old warehouses (clothing, if I remember correctly) and some just selling a few racks of crap. 

* Canal was much more wholesale, especially the western end, where I remember going with my brother to get speaker parts, and maybe car parts (but we were souping up the speakers in his '78 Camaro, so it might have just been speakers).

* The West Village was much more hippie/bohemian and had lots of little stores selling ""artsy"" silver jewelry and pipes. West 4th was a strip of tattoo parlors, and the piers at the end of Christopher were notorious for gay cruising.

* The Coliseum at Columbus Circle made that area pretty deserted during the day. I remember one REALLY friendly, not at all dirty/mentally ill/drugged up guitarist would play every morning for cigarettes and say hi to everyone. 

* The best way it was different was that nightlife was an escape. You could go out and go fucking nuts and not worry about it going viral and ruining your life/career. Clubs were dark: you went to be invisible and have fun.

3,"Yes I do- I was actually on the island the other day and asked the person who runs the ferry. An emergency boat has to come, it brings you into the city and you get charged a big fine. "
4,"Two things that got these fools out of my property: cameras and a super bright flood light with very sensitive motion sensors. 

"
5,"You know how teachers used to keep certain papers or projects from past classes to show current students an example of what theirs should look like? I nominate you as this subs example. 

10k for moving seems more than enough. I just moved with my gf with fees, security deposit and all we spend about 4.3k each on a 2.3k appt. 

I think living with roommates is your best option. Not only does it give you a few friends possibly but makes it easier affording a place in a nicer area. 

Something to keep in mind if you plan on staying here short term, the L train (Bushwick and Williamsburg are the two big hoods that are on this line) will be shut down between bk/manhattan for a year or so. This could affect you wanting to be a ""Short train from manhattan""

I think you're on the right path though. I would say Astoria, Greenpoint, LIC, Woodside(Queens), Clinton Hill would be great for you. There's obviously others. 

"
6,"An unmarked bar with really expensive drinks, generally a 1920's theme."
7,using the unlimited metrocard to hop on the bus for super-short trips.
8,I'm not interested but I love this post.
9,Can we hate Yelp instead? 
10,"High Yelp reviews I hate, artichoke pizza. Low that I love, Kennedy fried chicken."
11,"A lot of people who got paid minimum wage get by by leaving very, very far from work.

You can go grocery shopping in Chinatown/Asian market. They have cheap meat and veggies that could guarantee low-budget but balanced meals. I used to survive on $50 a month with ground pork, cabbage, bok choy, rice and eggs. In tough times, don't be afraid to reach out to food pantry.

Best of luck!
"
12,Lots of joke answers here... does anyone actually know?
13,"My favorite thing to do for New Year's Eve is get the fuck out of here so I don't have to deal with it.

My second favorite thing to do is to stay in my apartment with friends and booze.

My third favorite thing is to go to small neighborhood bars where there won't be a cover or tourists. "
14,"My uncle's son (Jeffrey) works for the parks department. Honestly, every story my uncle shares about him sounds boring. 

But apparently there is room for growth. He did such a great job in Central Park that they transferred him to Riverside. Riverside needs a ton of help. Maybe you'll be placed there. 

The pay is decent. But, he lives in a rent controlled building way uptown. He actually got it after an elderly Polish woman passed away. Something about a pony incident. Either way, it worked out great for him. 

So, it seems like a solid (if unremarkable) career. Good luck, OP. "
15,"&gt;maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention

I'd say this.  Grocers here are a much smaller breed than what you see outside of NYC.  I wouldn't say they are hidden though.  But aisles are often just narrow enough for two people to pass each other and product is displayed in every square inch of shelving from floor to ceiling.  

In my old apt, we had 5 markets available within walking distance of varying sizes and price ranges (Trader Joes, Fairway, West Side Market, Citarella, and Zabar's).  This made it incredibly easy to cook in all the time.  My new hood has fewer, but still quite adequate.  My wife cooks almost every day.

What keeps NY'ers from cooking is not the lack of grocers, it's the tiny freakin' kitchens! (and often busy schedules)"
16,"[It's believed they're used in shooting clubs.] (https://www.thedodo.com/community/WildBirdFund/reward-offered-for-help-in-cap-1012657535.html) You did the right thing.

Edit: here's [footage](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/man-filmed-catching-pigeons_us_56ae6521e4b077d4fe8e86fb) of a guy netting pigeons - if it's the same dude/car, make sure you mention it to the NYPD."
17,"At 17 year old, this would be a good life lesson for him to navigate an area. Just impart general wisdom upon him, don't flash anything expensive, keep the phone in the pocket, make sure he has his metrocard on him, and be aware of his surroundings. Other than that, market hotel is not far from the station, and broadway is a busy street, so he should be fine. "
18,This is like a month's worth of activities...
19,BANNED
20,Learn the name of your neighborhood.
21,"100% absolutely

As unbelievable as it may seem....despite the terrible shape of the city back in those days, it was ironically far less class divided

Anyone could go to the Mudd Club and drink with artists like Warhol a couple of feet away

If you wanted to be an artist, you could get a shit job at McDonald's, pay 50 bucks a month for rent or squat in a building and make it

Today, rent is so high that unless you have money...you will forever be stuck working just to make rent"
22,"Yep. A whole lot. Unfortunately being a woman in NYC will make this happen pretty frequently. When I'm in my home neighborhood, I always make sure I know where the police station is in relation to my apt. I can't tell you how many times in my 'super safe' neighborhood in Brooklyn I've had to walk my ass to the steps of the police station instead of home bc some piece of shit following me. Never show people where you live if you think you're being followed, and run into the nearest bodega. Just don't look or act afraid- like lots of looking backward and fast walking. I learned to walk like I'm the angriest woman alive and it actually deters a lot more than I thought it would. "
23,"Late 80s-Early 90s era

TriBeCa basically didn't exist. The area around Warren/Chambers was mostly empty with some low-rent dollar store type places.  The McDonalds on the corner of Chambers was one of the more promising businesses. Up until the mid-late 90s the northern part of Battery Park City was mainly just empty lots, unused land. In 93 there was an unobstructed view from Stuyvesant to WTC. 

See also, DUMBO. Didn't exist as a residential neighborhood, that area had no name. 

No white person would go to Bushwick except to buy drugs. If you drove up the Eastern Parkway Extension, you'd see mainly boarded- up and burned- out vacants. 

The area around Atlantic Terminal was a complete craphole. There were literally rubble strewn empty lots, looking like a war zone. Going to BAM was kinda sketchy.  If you had to transfer between Atlantic and Pacific, there was a long ass tunnel. Chase opened Metrotech around ?92?, and people thought they had gone plum insane. Who would ever want to work there? 

My brother quit Brooklyn Tech because the neighborhood was too dangerous. 

On the LES, Katz's was usually empty or near empty. I wondered why the place was so big, and how they survived. 

They called Bryant Park ""Needle Park"" because it was top to bottom junkies shooting up. "
24,My mom used to tell us to just walk out into traffic and stop it if someone is right up on you and you  believe you're going to be hurt. I thought this advice was crazy until this happened to my sis when she was with her kids when they were little. Creepy guy comes up behind them and he starts harassing her and making overtures. She was on a busy side street and walked herself and the kids right out into traffic. The first guy stopped his car and asked her what was going on. That's when crazy guy ran away. So it worked.
25,Pretty sure there are public restrooms in the park...
26,"/u/PigeonProwler, you seem to know a lot about this Pigeon Prowler...   

/s"
27,I've gone two blocks if the bus was right there. 
28,Download the 311 app and file a complaint as the incident is happening. Repeat this every single night until this stops.
29,"I pay $350 for my rent but I live in Queens.  I share it with my 3 friends.  I eat out a lot in restaurants before but recently, I started preparing my own food and cook.  It will save you $$$$.  "
30,"[Here's a list](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Gay+Male+Strip+Club&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY) of NY's gay strip clubs, or maybe you all would enjoy [Chinese language lessons](http://www.chinainstitute.org/)

31,And so the cycle begins again
32,"Typically it means it's not advertised or there's a secret unmarked door. 

Examples: Please Don't Tell (enter through the phone booth in Crif Dog) or Angel Share (enter through unmarked door in that Japanese Yakitori place.)

It's a bit twee and not really a secret, just all part of the atmosphere. 

A few people use it to describe a well marked bar with a Prohibition theme; these people are stupid. [Edit: image finally loaded, that says it's ""speakeasy themed"" in other words, this meaning]"
33,"My husband cooks dinner every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday night and usually Fridays and Sundays. It's definitely cheaper to eat at home for the same quality of food, but my husband is a damn good cook and I have the ass to prove it. "
34,"The Library offers universal returns; most circulating material (such as books and DVDs) can be returned to any New York Public Library location in the Bronx, Manhattan or Staten Island, except the Schomburg Center. Likewise, pickup of holds and payment of fines and fees may take place at any Library location with the exception of Schomburg."
35,You're in New York. We have the BEST freaks!
36,They both exist because I'm the early history of the subway they were competing rail lines owned by separate companies.
37,"As a guy, I sometimes fear women think I'm following them. I'm not, I just walk faster than you and can't pass you because you don't walk in a straight line."
38,Keep making 311 complaints. If you make like 30 something's bound to happen.
39,All of us. 
40,"This post is weird, and the comments are weirding me out too. 

You guys seem weirdly wound up about ""bad"" customer service and meting out some form of justice. I mean hidden pen cameras? 

Also it's a city of eight million people, not a two horse town. Getting a short list from people isn't going to help much anyway"
41,"Stock up on water and ammunition, sleep under the bed and crank up your transistor radio."
42,"At first I thought ""Ghana Central"" was some kind of racist slang for a black neighborhood in brooklyn or queens... then I realized this was autocorrect for ""Grand Central""
"
43,Because some people are just fucking stupid.
