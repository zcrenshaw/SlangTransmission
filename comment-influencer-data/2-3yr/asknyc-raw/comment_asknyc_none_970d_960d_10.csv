0,"The majority of the frequent racist and super right wing posters are also regular posters in /r/chicago, /r/Portland and /r/losangeles. Basically the Donald likes to troll the subs of liberal cities with the same canned arguments and straw men."
1,"&gt; I'm not terribly good at throwing

Twist: OP is a dog"
2,"As a lifelong Brooklynite, I can say that in my experience a lot of the old school white New Yorkers (Italians, Irish, etc.) are pretty racist."
3,You kill it and move on with your day. 
4,Midtown East. I always thought UES and UWS start after E/W 59th St.  Since 10th Ave turns into Amsterdam Ave after 59th St. 
5,Not in construction.   
6,Or in Police work. Or in firefighting. Or in the department of sanitation. 
7,"Steakhouse: You should go to Keen's.  It's better than Peter Luger's in every way, and it's historic.

Fraunces Tavern perhaps?  It's historic, but last time I was there it sucked.  That was almost 10 years ago.

Ippudo ramen: I would take this off the list.  I've been to both the NYC and Tokyo Ippudo locations.  The ramen is not special in either city.  There's better ramen in NYC, and I wouldn't even call it ""an experience"".

Most New Yorkers ignore the circle line.  Take the boat that circles Manhattan.  It's trippy.

Staten Island ferry.

Kiss in front of the statue of Peter Stuyvesant in Washington Square Park.

Eat a hotdog and a bag of fries at the Coney Island Nathans.

Ride the Cyclone.

Eat at Totonnos and get into an argument with the female owner.

Eat clams and oysters at the clam bar in Grand Central Station.

Highline

Walk the prominade.

Forget the Statue of Liberty.

Roosevelt Island Tram at night

Go to 2nd Ave Deli (or Katz's -- bonus points for arguing with the waiter)

Go to an iconic Harlem eatery.  It doesn't matter which -- they're all past their heyday.  Sylvia's, Amy Ruth, etc.

Go to one of the iconic comedy clubs like Caroline's, Gotham, Comedy Cellar.

Spend $200 on an evening at the Blue Note.

Walk past the 8th Street Playhouse and shake your head sadly.   When you walk past Electric Ladyland, yell ""JIMIIIII!!!!!!!"".

Walk past CBGBs and shake your head sadly.  Then walk 2 blocks west and get a latte from Starbucks.

Walk the Brooklyn Bridge to Dumbo and go to a really pretentious DUMBO bar.  Or Pedro's if you want to see what a hole-in-the-wall looks like when it's been gentrified.

A Broadway play is kind of mandatory, right?

Flushing is missable.  Don't get me wrong, I love it.  But if you're after *quintessential* NYC experiences, Mott Street trumps Flushing.

Oh, have Italian food in Microscopic Italy, and then dessert in Ferrara.

Eat a bialy.  I don't think they exist outside of NYC.

Get a pie at John's of Bleecker.  Yeah, I'm a foodie.

Smoke some weed and see a laser show at Hayden Planetarium.  Pretend you're on a date in high school.

Go to a block party / street fair.

8,I'm a Jew and I'll add old NY Jews to that list.
9,"I'm only a recent transplant, so not an authority, but I'd characterize this city as one of the few where you can walk around and easily rely on most people not giving a shit about your race. It'd be an angry life being racist in a city as diverse as New York."
10,You have until January 31st to enroll in Obamacare. I suggest you do it immediately. 
11,No officer. We don't know anything about underground poker rooms
12,"Lifelong NY'er born and raised here. Living in queens my whole life I'd do all the tourist trap stuff.  Empire State, Statue of Liberty, top of the rock. Never did any of it on 40 years living here."
13,I'm sorry you don't feel like you belong.
14,"1. Actual NYC racists (see: Archie Bunker)
2. Trolls from the various racist subs or outside forums. De Blasio is a right wing lightning rod and I suspect these posts have increased from when Bloomberg was Mayor.

The second source is a bigger factor I think, as the background level of racism is low and then a given thread will totally blow up with it, so someone is probably linking them."
15,"Uh, I didn't know there was an agreed upon distinction between upper and lower midtowns. I'd just call it midtown east. "
16,Make apartment hunting the sole focus of your existence if you can. 
17,Sounds like you could use a dog.
18,Really? What gives. Things like this amuse me. I can't even imagine wasting my time annoying people from a different city I don't live in on an online forum by saying racist things. People really do that? The internet is a strange place. 
19,"that is normal for a month to month agreement with no lease. Lucky they give you 45 days, the standard is about 30 days"

21,"You can talk to his family and see if he has any supports. If he gets supports, explain to the family that the supports need to work on socialization and safety.

Its totally OK to say to him very firmly and directly that you do not want to talk to him and he cannot put his hand in your car window.  He won't pick up on social cues so you need to be direct."
22,"Always wanted to tour the gold vaults at the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/visiting.html)
"
23,☝️Here's one of those dickheads OP is talking about 
24,Times Square Elmo in the summer.
25,"So what's your question? The all knowing hand of the market says you're too poor to live in Manhattan in the exact conditions you desire. 

So change your requirements or don't move to NYC. Seems pretty simple. "
26,What the hell is lower upper-east lol
27,What's your question? Did you want us to chip in?
28,"Check out the r/ultimate. There are tons of us. You shouldn't have to pay to toss. 

"
29,"When the conductor punches you, tell him you want to get off at Flushing, and get back on again. Its allowed, he just signs your ticket so the next conductor knows you spoke. [Edit: IIRC they wrote something on the back too].

I've done the same, getting off at Forest Hills to do some shopping, then getting back on to Kew Gardens. "
30,"\#1 on my bucket list would be: ""Cancel plans to leave""

Seriously.  I was born in Brooklyn in the 50s, grew up in Manhattan and Queens, went away for a half dozen years in the military in the 70s, spent the next 20 years or so working some memorable jobs around the city, including 14 years driving ambulances, then had a run of bad luck and wound up homeless, living on the streets for a couple years.  

That was 17 years ago.  I live in Virginia now, after having lived in PA and MD before here.  Hardly a day has gone by in those 17 years where something didn't make me think of NYC, or remind me of something from there.  Off, off Broadway plays at 2 AM in a borrowed SoHo warehouse.  Visiting clubs you'll never remember the name of, but never forget the music from.  Days spent in one of the many parks, each a special oasis in it's own way.  Standing on the waterfront in Brooklyn, looking at a skyline like no other in the world, the memory of which will bring tears of homesickness to your eyes decades later.  The sight, sound and smell of the subway, unlike any other, making life without a car possible. A ride through the harbor on the Staten Island Ferry, one of the best things to enjoy for free in the city.  Delis.  Honest to god delis, with potato salad to die for and a smile and a pickle slice with your sandwich.  Hot dog carts. Corner bodegas. Juniors cheesecake. Pizza by the slice.  Concerts, basketball and hockey at MSG. Ethnic neighborhoods where you can almost visit a different country for an afternoon.  Opening night at the Met.  Museums you could spend days in.  One of the best public library systems in the world.

There is *so much* you're going to miss.

You can take the New Yorker out of New York, but you can never take the New York out of the New Yorker.  It's true you know."
31,"People now avoid the locksmith altogether by using the KeyMe app.  You scan/photograph and securely store your keys image within the app.  With these pics,  you can go to one of its key printing kiosks and get a new key made immediately for a few dollars. There are a whole bunch of kiosks in 7 Elevens,  Rite Aids and Bed,  Bath &amp; Beyonds throughout the city."
32,Nice try NYPD.
33,"The key is to go to any bar Monday through Wednesday.  Once it gets into Thursday happy hour and weekend mode, any bar worth their salt turns into loud shitstorms no matter how ""mellow"" they are otherwise.

The Belfry, Big Bar, Shoolbreds all have cozy and mature vibes but definitely not weekends."
34,"Why would census officials ask you about your neighbors, and not about you?

Sounds like someone trying to find illegal renters or subletters."
