Yeah. **They got a** **whole section**. ""But do they have live comedy listings?"" You don't get it, do you? It's got a bit of everything, much of which isn't listed in that big money, blowhard rag, TimeOut. Village Voice? Antiquated and irrelevant. For old people, by old people. FOPBOP. Anyways, give The Skint a try. Great site.  

Note: There's stuff for old people on there too.

1,"Not being snarky: multiple jobs.

Everyone I knew had a side gig, whether it was bartending or tutoring or, um, sales of combustibles.

It's all about supplementing the income, even a little bit. Weekend flea markets, etsy shops, etc. If you can generate a couple hundred bucks in the off time, it really helps. (One dude would buy crap at the flea markets in New Jersey on Saturday and sell them in Williamsburg on Sunday for profit.)

TL; DR - NYC is all about the side hustle."
2,"Dos Toros in World Financial Center.  Oh my god it's so much better than Chipotle.  There are a few other locations around NYC too, check their [website.](https://www.dostoros.com/)"
3,"No one will care either way.

I don't mean that in a rude way. "
4,It is so people who are looking for bikes can easily eyeball which ones are damaged without having to individually check each of the small red lights on the dock.
5,"Where the crosswalks meet the sidewalk there will be slushy ponds 12"" deep. And when you walk around them you will encounter a 24"" tall snobank barring you from the sidewalk.  Which you then have to summit in order to get out of the road.

The city is very good at clearing the streets quickly.  The system is poor about clearing the sidewalks (except where tourists go), the city is ABYSMAL at ensuring the connection between the crosswalk and sidewalk is cleared.

BRING TALL BOOTS"
6,"In my experience snow has no effect on the tracks whatsoever. However, there seems to be an increase in the amount of random stupid shit that happens during a storm, for example an umbrella blows onto the tracks and catches fire. 

Source: Live off the 7 train. "
7,"You've already made a shit decision by moving here without a plan, so I won't lecture you about that.   

Find a place to live. Sublet a spot. Pinch your fucking pennies because shit's gonna get tight quick. If you're really sold on NY being where you want to be, sell your car, you don't need it.    

Take steps to establish residency.   You'll want this down the road.   

Find a job. I don't know what you're good at other than retail, but you don't want retail here. If you want, grab a job doing that in the mean time and keep applying. Try temp agencies, a lot of people get temp to perm positions through there.   

You're going to struggle. Hard. You're probably fucked.   

But hey, do what you would do anywhere and add a lot more hustle and you'll make it out okay.    "
8,That poor cat. 
9,I lived with someone who made $27k/year. Her parents paid for her housing. A lot of these jobs are meant for people on the right side of the cycle of poverty.  
10,"311 App has a way to call for homeless assistance. They'll send someone to check in on the guy and get him help or to a shelter. However if the guy is violent or threatening, then you may want to call 911. "
11,"You believe that driving into NYC at 6pm on a Friday is faster than the train. 

This belief is false. "
12,"Pro tip: If you are going to live in a third floor walk up with a bedroom window facing Broadway, expect it to be fucking loud. How loud you might ask..

Well, do a little test: Go sit in a car with a friend for a few hours and give your friend a simple instruction to play the song below at max volume right as you fall asleep.

https://youtu.be/QaXNazCvhrY

If your first instinct is to get up and dance because that is your favorite song, you belong in Washington Heights. 

If you are angry, but only because you prefer Frank Reyes over Anthony Santos, you belong in Washington Heights. 

If you feel the urge to start blasting your own favorite Frank Reyes song as a fun music battle for the neighborhood, you belong in Washington Heights. In fact, you should now probably run for city council. 

If you, however, feel upset because your ears are now bleeding and you have work in the morning AND GOOD GOD WHY IS IT SO LOUD WTF IS GOING ON WHY ARE THEIR WINDOWS DOWN IT'S 15 DEGREES OUTSIDE FUCK FUCK PLEASE STOP. you may want to consider a different location."
13,You get cheaper rent and never ever go out. The Bronx is cheap. Also don't measure yourself by your pay and job title and don't demean people for working retail.
14,"It's strange how much people shit on Katz's. Yes it's overpriced, no it's not the only place to get good pastrami, but it is an experience and guaranteed delicious pastrami"
15,It will be much more difficult for you to get people to come back to you apartment for sex if you live in New Jersey.
16,"If you live in New Jersey, you file a New York State Non-residency tax return, along with your New Jersey tax return. Your income is essentially subject to New York *state* taxes, but you do avoid the New York City residency tax.

The residency tax is around 3.5%. If you make $100,000 per year, it comes out to be about $300 extra you're paying per month just to live in New York City. But that's before all your deductions. In reality, if you're making $100,000 per year, the part of your income actually subject to that 3.5% tax ends up costing you something closer to $200 a month.

However, to live in New Jersey and work in New York, you will need to get a Smartlink card for the PATH train, which is $89 a month.

So, right off the bat, we're talking a difference of somewhere in the range of $100-$200 per month more to live in New York City for someone making $100k. If you make less, it'll be less. If you make more, it'll be more.

The downside is, you live in New Jersey. By that I mean, it changes your lifestyle, because the PATH runs on a limited schedule at night, and many of the people you know will live in the five boroughs. So *you're* the one who always ends up going into the city to meet your friends or go on dates, and *you're* the one who ends up spending a lot more of your life on subway platforms waiting for transfers. And you're the one who always heads home at midnight so you can be home by 1:30 while everyone else stays out til 1:00 and is in bed fifteen minutes before you are. 

And so, there will be those nights where you'll be like, eh, maybe I'll take a cab home, and one or two of those per month virtually wipes out any huge cost savings you started with.

Even if all your social circle does live in Jersey, you still end up going into New York frequently if there's any kind of event you want to see--concerts, comedians, theater in the park, restaurants, most sporting events, limited release films, art galleries, museums, whatever. 

After a while, a lot of people who live in New Jersey get tired of those late nights in the city, so they either break down and move into Manhattan or Brooklyn, or else they just stay home at night most of the time in Hoboken or wherever they live. But then you're not really living in New York City. You're living in New Jersey.

A lot of people do it, so for some it's definitely worth it. But it really depends on what you want out of New York. Are you there to make money and save it up? Or are you there to experience New York City life? Because New York City life and north Jersey life are similar, but they're two different things. "
17,The golden rule of NYC is in effect: never acknowledge another person's existence ever. 
18,"Bushwick is a pretty hip neighborhood. When I was making mid-30s and starting out in NYC, I lived in a neighborhood no one I met had ever heard of and no one I met would ever visit and I spent all of my time on the subway to get to places I wanted to be. 

I shared a bedroom with someone else, too. 

I knew other people who were making similar amounts. A lot of them lived in places best described as semi-legal, with shared bathrooms, or in far out neighborhoods. Some people had wealthy parents. Some people worked second jobs or did all kinds of random paying gigs on the side. 

But a lot of the people I knew who were in those positions and didn't get a serious salary upgrade soon (which was most of them) left the city for greener pastures or changed careers to fields that were more lucrative. "
19,"Random people aren't going to come up and pinch you. 


When I was in elementary school, we'd pinch people that didn't wear green. That's the only time I've ever heard of it."
20,"I think there isn't anything you could do that would be worse than privatizing the services. This isn't the UK. Look at what happened in LA. I really can't think of a thing that would ratfuck the system worse than it already is the way privatization would.

My latest bug is that I think new construction should have to pay some kind of one-time increased capacity tax directly to the MTA, earmarked for the lines local to the new construction - be it for station improvement, increased trains or buses, or whatever else needs done. 

"
21,Reverse commuter here. This is also a false belief.
22,"I was supposed to be in full-day meetings all week with representatives flying in from all over the country.  Our CEO just cancelled the whole week.

Fucking SCORE."
23,"One day ago you made a post on /r/changemyview saying that you're thinking about moving to NYC. And now you've somehow already driven across the country. 

My guess is you're putting up a hypothetical scenario to get advice. Hopefully that's the case. If so, read the advice carefully. Avoid coming here without a job and/or a place to stay. Get either of those set up (ideally both) and you'll be in a position to begin your journey. It will be challenging and full of moments of despair, but if it's what you want to do then it'll be worth it."
24,Serious Eats has a recipe for halal cart chicken and rice that includes a recipe for the white sauce! It's delicious!
25,"He was fucking with you.

Edit to add: Ooooor you took it too seriously. There is a tradition of pinching people who don't wear green, but that's a thing that kids in school do or that parents do to their kids, not a thing grown-ass adults do to random strangers. "
26,"Same problem here except the mentally ill homeless guy was harassing people on the subway platform.  Notified 311 via their app.  

Result: 1st try: couldn't find him. 2nd try: found him but refused homeless outreach assistance. 3rd and 4th request ignored.  

He's still here and harassing straphangers on the platform but everyone who's familiar just tries to avoid him :/ 

Hope you have better luck and if you find a solution, please post. "
27,"A lot of places do, yes. It's more of a work from home scenario, though."
28,"Dig Inn. Same kind of thing, customizable, feels healthy. Has a comfort food/soul food flair. "
29,"yeah, the money in advertising is shit starting out.  Luckily, in that industry it's fairly normal to jump jobs all the damn time.  You should be already applying to new jobs for more pay.  I'm not being facetious when I say I know multiple people who jumped from their first ad job after less than a year and got large raises at new positions. 

Also, as a piece of advice:  you posted down below and said something like you were 'invested' in advertising because you had a degree in it and an internship.  Get that shit out of here. Very few people in the business world give half a fuck what your degree is in - I've seen professional programmers with history degrees, data analysts with journalism degrees, sales people who used to be lawyers, etc.  You should be looking at all kinds of jobs, locking yourself into the advertising box is just going to severely limit your options and your earning potential.  Look at TV networks, marketing roles, sales jobs, PR firms, publishing, data analyst jobs, social media jobs, all of it. Given that you're in advertising you probably have relationships or contacts already at many of the above types of companies/jobs.  

You are absolutely not 'invested' in advertising unless it's like your life passion or something (which I doubt, seeing as you don't seem to have a creative role).  Go do whatever and get paid homey."
30,"A friend who works in the area just reported that the line was still ""ass-long"" today, but I don't know what that means in real measurements. Either way, the hype is still there and people are waiting on line in 19-degree weather. "
31,"I'm on Reddit too much. This morning I was actually thinking ""Did drunk guy make it to Katz's?"" Now I know and can continue my day."
32,I've taken my EZ Pass out of my car plenty of times to use in a friend's cat. I'm pretty sure there's no problem with it...I've definitely never been penalized.
33,"its to showcase the club and make it look popular, the club pays for the table. guys go to clubs where there are girls. really more of a marketing expense "
34,"It's a thing we all go through when we really get out on our own after school. Don't take the fact that six months have passed as a sign against you. In my experience moving around as an adult, it takes about a year of active effort to create a social network in a new place. 

IMO, the best way to do it is to find somewhere to be a regular. It can be a meetup, a bar, a coffee shop, a study spot - whatever it is, just make it something you like and something that isn't difficult to get to. I prefer to pick places near my apartment, but places near your work will be better than places near neither. Ideally, pick something that is the kind of thing that the kind of people you wnat to befriend would like or enjoy. 

Now you just have to go and be a regular. You just show up, all the time, on the regular. At first, you will sit alone and not talk to people for the most part. But eventually, staff and other patrons will peg you as a regular. You'll start having casual chats with people. Eventually, it will turn into a friendly thing when you go there. Then, all you're waiting for is for someone to talk about something they've done that doesn't involve the place that you're both regulars and you will say ""oh cool, hey if you ever do something like that again, and don't mind company, let me know."" Alternatively, when you are planning to go do something alone, you let people that are other regulars know about it and tell them to hit you up if they decide to join you, as you will be there anyway, whether or not they come.

It takes a while, but it will work eventually. "
35,But you don't.
