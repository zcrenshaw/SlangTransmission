0,"Some months back, I was at a crosswalk in Brooklyn looking left, then right, then left again.

A guy in a suit pauses a yelling cell phone conversation to snicker at me, saying, ""It's a one-way, bro""

No sooner had he set foot in the intersection than he has a mild collision with a bicyclist going the wrong way. Neither was hurt enough to slow down and as the cyclist rode off, the two competed to see who could say, ""Watch where you're going!"" the loudest.

It was a tie!"
1,The first time a broker told me that his fee was 15% of a year's rent and didn't flinch when I started laughing.
2,"New York’s hottest club is Taste. Nightlife designer Tranny Griffith is back with an all-new club that answers the question Huh?!? Don’t look for a bouncer – there isn’t one. Instead the door’s guarded by ten jacked homeless guys in old-fashioned bathing suits. And inside it’s just sick: ice sculptures, winos, Germufs – German smurfs – a Teddy Ruxpin wearing mascara, an old lady wearing Kid ‘N Play hair, and none other than DJ Baby Bok Choy…He’s a giant 300-pound Chinese baby who wears tinted aviator glasses and he spins records with his little ravioli hands."
3,Renter's insurance
4,A smart man knows which way the streets go. A wise man looks both ways regardless. 
5,Have we learned nothing from the 90's? 
6,"It was six years ago, but I witnessed a fisherman reel up a bicycle from the sea out in Coney Island. [Picture proof.](http://i.imgur.com/rxTqPOz.jpg)"
7,"New York’s hottest club is Gush. Club owner Gay Dunaway has built a fantasy world that answers the question, ""Nooow?"" This place has everything: geeks, sherpas, a Jamaican nurse wearing a shower cap, room after room of broken mirrors, and look over there in the corner-- is that Mick Jagger? No. It’s a fat kid on a slip 'n slide. His knees look like biscuits and he’s ready to party."
8,"Had to drive in to Chelsea with my toddler for some kid event around the High Line. 
Don't recall why I couldn't take a train.
I circled and circled around Chelsea Market looking for a spot. 

Suddenly under the high line by Morimoto's a transvestite screams at me there was a spot and she held it for me and even helped me as I parallel park. 

My toddler was in awe at her outfit and giggled in delight and smiled at the transvestite with the full beard and fishnets and kept waving and screaming ""Thank you!"" out the window at her. "
9,"The biggest threat of her living in the LES is her finding someone more interesting than you.

Edit: wait she already lives in the east village? Are both of you stupid?"
10,"&gt;I get that it's my landlord's property and he can do what he wants

No, a landlord can't do whatever he wants. Call 311, google to find city housing places to report the illegal use of space if that is truly the case. But mainly, talk to a lawyer."
11,"
For a number of reasons I'd  recommend you try to get a shared room at the official Hostelling International youth hostel -- it's a great place to meet people and they have a ton of events, a great location, and excellent security.

The crime rate in NYC, you may be interested to learn, is just slightly higher than SLC, with NYC having about 1/4 the forcible rape per capita. The areas which are bad are actually quite hard to wander into accidentally. 

Sorry you met a jackass, but what the heck, enjoy yourself! "
12,"I was on the bus making my way home and while we were stopped at a red light, I watched two very talented male ballet dancers have a pirouette-off on the street. "
13,"please stay in new jersey, please..."
14,"On F train near 34th st the other day, someone Airdrop-ed me a dick picture..."
15,"Nothing is frowned upon in this city. Definitely bring lots of shorts/short sleeves, as it's VERY hot right now. Would personally not bother bringing jeans at all. 

Night out clothes depends on where you go. East Village area, you'd be fine with a cute top and bottoms (could bring cute jeans for this purpose I guess). Dress and heels would work as well though and be good for fancier places. Better to be too dressed up than too dressed down and risk getting bounced. "
16,"Dead homeless guy riding the #2.  When I walked in I thought he was sleeping, but a micro second later the ungodly death smell kicked in.   The guys face was all waxy, he had some green/brown ooze running out of his mouth. I figured he must have been riding that train all night. 
A few of us got off on the the next station call 911, a  few others just changed cars to getaway from the smell, hoping the train would not be stopped before they got to their station, saying stuff like ""Ive got to be in Brooklyn in 20 minutes and he's not in a hurry"". 

My clothes had the death smell all day. "
17,"It's absolutely reasonable for someone to not want a bunch of strangers having access to their stuff then they aren't there. Have you posed the idea of a few hours window of open house to her? Pick a few ranges that work for you and propose them to her, then advertise for the time and day agreed upon. "
18,"You can place a 311 complaint online. File it under ""illegal conversion"". The city will send an inspector and they will issue a violation of they can get in and it's an illegal unit. "
19,Pizza suprema 29th and 8th.
20,"New York’s hottest club is Crease. Club promoter Tranny Oakley has gone all out. This place has everything: Lights, psychos, Furbies, screaming babies in Mozart wigs, sunburned drifters with soap sud beards. You know, that thing when the hobo becomes a rich man, so they take that big bubble bath."
21,"A fire extinguisher. You can get one for less than $30, put it under your kitchen sink and forget about it. It will reduce your renters insurance by more than it costs to purchase it, and might save your life. "
22,"Noise can be a huge problem - people walking by having loud conversations, traffic (honking, police sirens, garbage trucks).

I wouldn't take the ground floor, unless it were really short term, and / or insanely cheap."
23,"One of those inflatable easy chairs from like 2003. It's not, like, handy or anything, I just think you should get one."
24,"I was walking home with a great buzz on 1st Ave &amp; 50something late one night when I saw a long haired dude standing outside a club in a fedora and fur coat that looked super familiar... As I got closer, it became super apparent who he resembled, and I said to him ""if you aren't Kid Rock you should be in the Kid Rock business"". He high-fived me as I walked by without breaking my stride and said ""I am! And business is good!"" "
25,Found suburbia to be absolutely soul crushing.
26,"And in case it isn't obvious to OP, they'll probably want to move after. I can't imagine their relationship will get better after they rat him out."
27,"Well on Thursday I went to a concert at MSG and some guy in a suit told me and my girlfriend to pick our stuff up and follow him, I immediately cocked back a ""fuck off"". The guy must've seen it coming because as I was opening my mouth he held up two tickets and said ""I'm upgrading you to side stage, go down starwell D and get off at level 6"". We were 3 rows from the stage moved from the last row in section 220.

One time I saw Barry bonds in a dive bar, I don't like baseball I only knew it was him because someone told me. Everyone was kind of hovering around him and he was super irritated. I wound up next to him at the urinals and he said ""sup bro"". I just shook my head and walked away, guy code Barry, no urinal conversations.

I was at a show at Irving plaza and some guy was just posted up in the bathroom giving out free lines of Coke.

I met one Bruce Willis's daughters without knowing, And didn't find out until I told someone I met this girl with a stupid fucking name. I can't remember which one it was anymore."
28,Blackout drapes.  Do it on move in day or you'll never get around to it.   Fire extinguisher / renters insurance.  Nice comfy throw rugs.  Something for white noise while sleeping (AC/fan).  
29,I moved to NYC to pursue the dream of getting the fuck out of North Carolina.  Achievement unlocked!
30,"New York’s hottest club is Your Mother And I Are Separating.  Don't be fooled by the charred Red Lobster sign out front; this club IS a burned-out Red Lobster. And it has EVERYTHING: A shake for breakfast, a shake for lunch, a sensible dinner, those shoes that nurses wear... And you can dance the night away to the sounds of Donald Duck having a Vietnam nightmare. "
31,Super dangerous. Mugging guaranteed. I wouldn't even dare. 
32,"I don't know. Me and some friends went up there one time to meet some other groups and got set up for something we didn't do. It took us all night to get back to Brooklyn by train and on foot. We only made it to Coney Island just as the sun was coming up.

The best."
33,"A plunger/ toilet brush, my roommates and I never thought about them until we needed them lol"
34,Is this a joke? Am I in the circlejerk subreddit? You really live in NYC and she lives in NYC and you're asking if the LES is safe? Really?
35,Heavens full of people with the right of way
