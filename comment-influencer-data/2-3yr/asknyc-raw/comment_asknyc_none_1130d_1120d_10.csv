0,Get a temporary sublet. Then get a job. Then get a full time lease. 
1,"Welcome to New York. 

There have been a number of laws passed about this; enforcement has been stepped up. It's way less frequent now than it used to be. It's something the city has been working on for a while and I would be shocked to see it completely eliminated. "
2,People who write Time Square. 
3,"People who wait to get their metrocard out of their purse/wallet until they're at the fucking turnstile. 



Dog owners who let their dogs leash stretch the entire length of the sidewalk. "
4,"As someone who lives in Washington Heights, I'm glad you had terrible time. I hope you never come back and be sure to tell your friends how terrible our neighborhood is so they don't come here either."
5,Probably from shit on the street.
6,"When people come out of a store or building, don't look both ways, and walk right in front of you, slowing you down."
7,"I've never been punched by a stranger.  However, my favorite unprovoked 'assault' happened to my friend Nikki about ten years ago - she was walking up the subway stairs at Columbus Circle.  A bum was walking up the stairs just ahead of her, so his ass was level with her face.  He farted, loud, then turned around and said 'That's for you, you fucking bitch.'  They had had no prior contact.  It was amazing.  

Anyway, very sorry that happened to you, and it's not a usual thing around here.  "
8,"Cats hate water, so put out a bowl of water. Make sure to change it every day. Another thing cats hate are dogs, and dogs like chicken, so grill a few chicken breasts and put them out on a plate. With any luck, you'll be cat free in no time."
9,"I don't have personal experience in this, but want to help because it sounds like you're making a very good decision. [Here's](http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/areamap.cfm?boro=M) a link to a list of meetings in Manhattan. Looks like there's plenty to choose from, including beginner's specific ones. Good luck!"
10,I'd skip the lawyer. Do you really want to take your deceased friends family to court? Start looking for a new place and give the new owner a reasonable timetable for when you'll be moving out.
11,"Thank you so much, I have been avoiding this for a long time. I am trying to see it as a positive step instead of negative."
12,"""This train is now running express"", says the conductor. 

""Bliss brain shamwow bsshhshsh hshshhshshshshshshsh"", says the loudspeaker.

""What?"", says I, followed by ""oh, fuck"" as we pass the first local stop."
13,The volume of passengers during rush hour. 
14,How do you think they feed the chupacabra?
15,"If its one thing cats can't stand, it's when you give them a punny name like, ""The Great Catsby."" Buy a collar with this new name and put it on-- that cat won't wanna see you again, trust me."
16,Headphones and a blank stare is the way to go.
17,"Yes, you should file a police report. Since you asked for a reason: in case of identity theft, you have documentation that you reported your credit cards and ID stolen. It helps keep your local precinct aware of crime trends. If they're caught (usually doing another crime) with your property on them, it'll be returned to you and additional charges can be brought against them."
18,"Just challenge them to a rap battle, and once you emerge victorious they will be forever shamed and be reduced to begging for change and listening to music on the LinkNYC machines.   

Edit: Whoa! Thanks for the gold kind stranger!    "
19,People that slow down or stop at the top of stairs when there is a crowd behind trying to exit. Thoughtless. 
20,"Besides the ""you should be happy it's not open until 4am"" and move comments.

How about laminate a sign and put it outside your stoop. Something like ""People live above this stoop and want to sleep. Please be quiet late night"" 

"
21,"Cats also get real jealous and territorial. Buy some cat toys and leave them around, and the cat will think another cat is already there. Goodbye cat!"
22,"No, seriously. Are you looking for a sub for you to talk about kid friendly things or a place for your kids themselves to talk on reddit."
23,Safety?
24,It's simple. People need to stop giving them money and attention. As long as they receive money they will continue to disrupt everyone's commute 
25,Try [this](http://www.nycsubwayguide.com/subway/)
26,"I want you to really reflect on what you're saying here.  If you read my history you'll see I'm a rich asshole with some controversial views on wealth inequality. But I'm rich because I'm fortunate enough that my very hard work actually goes towards a life of riches.  

These are human beings that you're talking about whose daily life is  literally humiliating themselves in front of strangers in exchange for whatever money those strangers offer out of pity or annoyance or whatever it is. They don't have 401ks they buy health insurance out of pocket, etc. 

No mother has a child and raises him hoping he'll turn out to be someone that dances and carries on for money in the subway.  And I want you to specifically compare the performers you see on the tracks that are often very skilled and performing for the sake of art and to make a small living vs. the people you're talking about who literally muster up any slight form of creativity they're able to manage that might earn them something.

And your view is this opportunity should be taken away from them because you can't be bothered for however long your commute is every so often.  You can't put on headphones, you can't read a book or play on your phone.  The plan needs to be that these people's already absurd source of income should be ended for your comfort.

But I bet you then also complain about the homeless that get in your way and wonder ""why don't they get a job?"""
27,"* Electronic devices of any kind, on speaker, on the subway.
* Those charity people with the vest on and the clipboard thinking they can zoom in on you. No.
* Someone standing right over you with a cup of coffee on a moving train. I don't care if it has a lid. If this thing stops short, that crap is going all over me.
* That annoying shitshow at USQ South outside of Whole Foods: the subway stop that always has someone blocking the stairs, a dozen sidewalk vendors, people trying to get into Whole Foods, people exiting Whole Foods, that stinky incense being sold, the south American lady with the mango-on-a-stick business, the  big fat couple with the huge cooler of $1 water.  "
28,"Based on the info you gave us - heres a couple of ideas to get you started:

[Here's a list](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Gay+Male+Strip+Club&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY) of NY's gay strip clubs.

Take [Chinese language lessons](http://www.chinainstitute.org/)"
29,A restaurant supply store. Trust me. Check the bowery. Quality will be better for a lower price
30,"Private yard, with a house, for under 1500? Lol. I don't think you've done any research."
31,Try manhattan Kansas
32,"It should be safe from humans. Vampires, not so much. "
33,"All of them. Every. single. one. The subway system is like Satan's asshole in summer.

That said, a special mention goes out to any subway station that has a ton of stairs and a broken escalator in the summer..."
34,"You got what you paid for. Picked a non-touristy, ethic, real NYC neighborhood, 20-30 minutes to Midtown, and hour from the Battery. If you're looking for peace and quiet, you didn't do your homework. Racism has something to do, because I guarantee you that Hell's Kitchen, the Meatpacking and the East Village are also not exactly the places you go for a good night's sleep, but I'm sure you'll let it slip because all the charming white drunk people you'll meet."
35,"Mine is when I buy a hot dog, I always hold my cash out ready to pay while the hot dog is cooking, but instead of taking my money and giving me change right then, the person always waits to hand me my hotdog, then gives me my change and then I have to fumble to put my change away while also holding my hot dog. First world problem I know, but still annoying."
