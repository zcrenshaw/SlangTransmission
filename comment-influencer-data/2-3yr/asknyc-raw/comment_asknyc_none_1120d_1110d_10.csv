1,Don't get on the empty subway car. 
2,"A NYC Yellow Cab driver gets hailed down by a beautiful rich model that told him she's afraid to fly after 9/11 and that she'll pay him $20,000 to take her to Hollywood plus room and board along the route. The cabbie agrees and they depart. The cross country trip goes smoothly as the model and cabbie share hotel rooms at every stop. The cabbie eventually drops her off at her mansion and proceeds to make his way back to NYC. Right when leaving California a guy sees the iconic NYC cab and tells the driver it must be fate because he's going back to the Bronx and can pay whatever the driver wants. The driver says ""sorry; I don't go to the Bronx.""

3,Mind your business.
4,"I take the Staten Island Ferry back and forth sometimes, just drinking cheap beer and enjoying the breeze.

"
5,"""MTA: Improving non-stop."""
6,There's actually a list of these places on the official NYC tourism website: http://www.nycgo.com/articles/24-hour-nyc-slideshow
7,Get out of the way.
8,... Domino's pizza. It's often cheaper and faster delivery than the local places.
9,"Let people exit the train before getting in

Always move to the center of the car

Don't eat hot/smelly food on the train

Don't spread out on the train during rush hour, do what you can to make room

Don't engage or argue with the crazy rambling dude on the train

Take your fucking backpack off and hold it in front of you/between your legs

Don't stop at the top of the fucking subway stairs and look all around in wonderment at the strange new world around you - keep walking

When you need to check your phone or tie your shoe on the sidewalk move over to the side don't just brake-check the person behind you

10,This [old sign](https://lifeloveandthepursuitdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/5871732148_a3538e7493.jpg) from Manhattan mini storage used to give me chuckle 
11,"I've enjoyed unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks many times, but only at the Chelsea Olive Garden.

Catch me on a good day, and I actually will be ready for showtime. "
12,"Personally, I don't buy any of the bullshit I read about ""dating in NYC"" because everyone is so different and looking for different things that making generalizations about dating is worthless when it comes to personal experience. 

My advice? You reap what you sow. If you're picky (as you should be, if you're looking for a long-term partner), you won't have a lot of dates, or you'll have a lot of one-offs and move onto the next one. But that's okay, because you're looking for your smart, insightful mate. You don't have to be attractive to the masses. You don't have to find 400 guys you find hot. You just have to click with the one you like. 

So join the apps, put up a good (honest but attractive) profile, and don't let dating be your focus or your barometer of identity and self-worth. At the same time, don't be lazy about it, because if you're looking for something worthwhile, it won't just fall in your lap. Good luck, and have fun out there!"
13,The rent
14,"My local shitty American Chinese food takeout dump. So many amazing food options around, but I just keep going back."
15,My favorite is either the Second Avenue Subway or the New York Jets. 
16,"Dollar slices.  I could eat 4 during lunch, and another 4 after a heavy night of drinking and late night eating in Ktown.

Also Halel Guys.  I could eat 2 mixed plates in one sitting there."
17,"Or the guy by grand central whose dad died last week and he just needs $25 for a ticket to get to the funeral. Poor guys dad dies every week.
"
18,Soulcycle is much more like a cult. 
19,"My new form response to these questions.

Wake up to an alarm clock.

Look out the window, dress accordingly.

Stumble blearily to the nearest bodega and pay a dollar for some shit coffee because the baristas at the hip spot across the street ask too many questions and charge too much for black coffee.

Go to the subway station, pack like sardines into a car.

Report to any office building, sit in the lobby for 8 hours and contemplate every choice you've ever made, break for lunch around 1:30, wait in line behind a tourist from Dallas who won't shut the fuck up about northerners not being nice. Behind you will be someone in an NYU sweater talking about how amazing whatever bar the gothamist/bushwickdaily/Bedford and Bowery did an article on yesterday is. You will order something simple, they will fuck it up.

After fake work, go to a bar, any bar, because the part of your brain that registers joy only works one day a week. Order a cheap beer, get shit from some rube about the oppressive beer conglomerate that owns said beer company and how he supports local Brewers. Ignore him and repeat 3 times.

Get on the subway, wait for some assholes to start doing backflips and then talking shit when you don't pay.

Go home to your over priced apartment, sit down on your favorite sitting implement. Turn on NY1, light your bong, kick your feet up and repeat after me: I Love this fucking town."
20,The Hare Krishnas still hang out in Union Square.
21,Scientology has been expanding all throughout Harlem

The light at the end of the tunnel is New Jersey. :\^)"

24,"Actually, I dictated it into my Amazon Echo from the comfort of my couch and then hired someone via TaskRabbit to hit ""submit"" for me."
25,"Moved here from Australia, have never had a $4 philly cheese steak (from bodegas and delis) before. That stuff has taken over my world. Sometimes I'll even eat them sober. "
26,"* Hurry the fuck up, someone is behind you

* Don't take anything from someone on the street (flyers, shitty mixtapes, coupons)

* Right side is the slow lane, left side is the ""passing"" lane (sidewalks, escalators, everywhere)

* Don't upstream someone else trying to hail a cab"
27,"Personally,the left side of an escalator should be reserved for walking and the right side for standing. "
28,Let people exit the subway before entering 
29,"That's not a NYC rule, that's an ""every fucking place there are escalators"" rule. "
30,"I can't believe nobody has posted this [quintessentially classic NY joke](https://www.carnegiehall.org/BlogPost.aspx?id=4295022505):

Q: ""How do you get to Carnegie Hall?""

A: ""Practice."""
31,"""There's another train directly behind this one."""
32,You're gonna slip and break your neck. Hoodlums will swarm your body and take everything you own. Safer to stay where you live now.
33,"""Good evening ladies and gentlemen!  I am not a drug addict! I am not a criminal! I have fallen on hard times and I am trying to turn my life around!  The shelter where I stay does not blahblahblah!""  And it goes on."
34,"no specific one, but anytime someone asks a vague, nearly unanswerable question, and instead of humbly admitting they were wrong or using the sidebar after being prodded, they get belligerent and argumentative.  It's like, admitting you were wrong is SO impossible that it must be new yorkers are jerks, because I can never be wrong."
35,Someone needs to tell that to the people who announce their whole life story to the entire subway car.
36,"New York is an incredibly exciting city, there is always something happening. And most of it goes unsolved."
37,"Wait.   you mean  
1.  If I'm a fat fucking lard, the entire sidewalk doesn't belong to me?  
2.  If I'm holding bae's hand, we can't just take up the whole sidewalk?  
3.  If I'm a badass and I decide not to move, but then cornhole_of_truth shoulders me to the concrete, that my rights haven't been violated?  
4.  If I'm too autistic to understand the unwritten laws of the sidewalk, I don't get a free pass for being ignorant?  
  
Fucking. blasphemy.  "

39,"""We are experiencing a momentary delay due to train traffic ahead of us"""
40,"""How do you know someone's from New York? They've already told you 5 times"""
41,It's the Halatzoah EMS. The Orthodox have their own EMS force that outfits their personal cars with lights and sirens. 
42,"I remember some guy kept posting every week or so asking if an Indian guy dating a white woman would be unusual in NYC. Despite EVERYONE telling him no one would even bat an eye, that everyone dates everyone else here, he refused to accept it as truth. There were 3-4 posts over a few months. Still not sure if he was trolling or not."
43,Oh man I'm just here for the comments.
