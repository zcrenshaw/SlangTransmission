"Damn dude, you cussed out a user/child on a recorded call and got congratulated? Sounds like you had the dream job there. "

They spent many hours double teaming old ladies...
"But seriously, Miss Jones, we need that computer back."
"I've told this story a few times, and I tell it to all of the new hires who want to be a manager some day. Best boss I ever had. 

Was working as a Lifeguard. 

Idiot patron comes in. Does idiot patron stuff. 

""Sir. Please stop being foolish. It's dangerous."" 

""I will not, as I am a huge asshole, and very stupid."" 

""Sir, if you will not stop, I will call the cops, and you will be escorted, politely, but firmly the hell outside.""

""Who is your manager?! What is your name!?"" 

Gave both. Patron storms off. Finish shift uneventfully. 

Walk over to offices to be fired, or at least chewed out. 

Boss lady is gone for the day. 

Ask Receptionist what happened. 

Patron came in. Had shouting match with our boss lady. 

Patron: ""He wouldn't let me do foolish things, and threatened to call the cops!"" 

Boss Lady: ""THAT. IS. WHAT. I. PAY. HIM. FOR.""

Patron left, unhappy. Never saw him on my shift again. 

I would have walked through FIRE for that woman. If I could have afforded it, I'd still be working for her today. Best boss I've ever had, even twenty years later. "
"Get on your knees and thank the gods of tech support for your good fortune: when an user provides data in the form of a pdf, it's usually just a scanned image."
"I feel like the end of the story should have gone like this:

...there hadn't been a building there since the late 1970's.  When I got back to the office, I told HR that she must not have updated her address but they said they had no idea who I was talking about.  After searching through the records, they discovered she used to work there but had died in 1977 when the building she lived in burned down. They showed me her employee photo and she looked the same age as she did when I saw her yesterday!

And then, I don't know, make some ""wooo"" noises or something."
"Update: The scan finished with over 5000 detected objects, some neutral installation files, but mostly adware and malware. I will never understand how this computer running 2GB DDR2 with an ancient processor could weather through this, but I am in awe."
The tech support call was coming from INSIDE the house!
"I remember a similar story while I was in a store (as a customer). Someone tried to bring back his laptop for warranty which they would not accept as the damage was not covered. The store clerk pointed out the rules of his extended warranty to which the customer replied ""So if I drop this laptop right now and it breaks, will that be covered?"". A hesitant yes later and it didn't take long for that laptop to hit the ground after which that same clerk helped him fill in the warranty forms.

Moral of the story: if ""smashed up"" is covered under warranty, everything is. "
"Exactly! It counts down! Not up! Like it's counted down from 100% (presumably).

Literally hours have been wasted here."
You apparently found the worlds most performance conscious malware programmers.
My boss is the exact same way.  It's nice to work for someone who has your back in these frustrating scenarios.
But she's typing on it right now. It's not plugged in or anything but...
"Bring this incident to your boss' attention. I'm sure they'll like to know that one of their employees was harassed after hours by an employee in another department over a user-error, that upon further investigation turned out to be non-critical."

"Who liked it so much, they told **all** their friends"
"&gt; Boss Lady: ""THAT. IS. WHAT. I. PAY. HIM. FOR.""

Best fucking answer ever. 

Reminds me of when I used to work in a paint store, and this one stubborn guy came in to buy some auto paint. Now, catalyzed auto paint is nasty shiznit - in addition to all the solvents, the hardener (which you mix in with the paint) contains isocyanates, which are also quite nasty. And keep in mind that you're aerosolizing all this stuff into an extremely fine mist. 

So I then asked him if he had a respirator. He said yes, one of ""those paper 3M ones"". In other words, a dust mask. But to spray any auto paint safely, you need, at the least, a NIOSH-certified chemical cartridge respirator (basically a gas mask).  We have them starting at 25 bucks, which is a *lot* less than he'd be paying for the paint. I told him as much. 

At this, he got *really* pissed, as if I were trying to upsell him and rip him off. I told him that it's the bare minimum required to be safe, and he got in my face and demanded to speak to my boss. 

He tells my boss how rude I'm being, trying to insist that he buy something he doesn't need, and how he's a paying customer, yadda yadda, what's the goddamn problem? My boss replies ""Well, frankly, I'd rather not be sued by you (or your next of kin). If you don't like it, get the hell out.""

Satisfying as fuck. "
And for some reason dialing my desk extension from her (probably rotary) phone doesn't work!
"If it was scanned, I would've just refused outright. I calculated the total time to do it manually at around ~60hrs."
HA. HA. HA. YES FELLOW HUMAN. WE ARE ALL HUMAN HERE. THERE ARE TOTALLY NO ROBOTS ON THIS SUBREDDIT. I AM ALSO ONE OF YOUR FLESHY HUMAN FRIENDS. 
"*Always* calculate the time a task will take. I had an online acquaintance ask me to help with some copy work for some products he was selling, offered to pay me $40, said I could probably finish it in less than a day. I counted the products - 250+.

I replied and told him that even if I could write descriptions of the quality he was asking for at an average of only *two minutes each*, it would take me 500 minutes, or **more than 8 hours**, and he was asking that I do it for the equivalent of $4.80/hour. Thanks but no thanks."
"Once caught my dad trying to type his hotmail password into Google (the search engine, not gmail), so this doesn't surprise me. It should. But it doesn't."
"I like the

""No. Already told you. I did nothing""

*put in some work. Find out that the user changed y and if he'd told you you could have fixed it in seconds*

""Alright. I fixed it. You did y which directly affects x. Don't do that again and you'll be fine. Next time just tell me""

""What? **That** mattered? I didn't think that would have any impact on anything""

""...""

I fucking hate it

"&gt; Turns out the lady had spread the word that there's a very knowledgeable older gentlemen in this store. Joe and Pete made a pretty good team over the time they were in our store.

That ended well, I guess? More business through word-of-mouth, although some pressure probably got put on Pete."
What? Why? 
"Who knows. Maybe they thought it would keep their Internet running fast, kind of like rebooting a computer often. "
So now you will basically sit around for 60 hours with the pdf open and fuck around?
"A few years ago I had a customer call up and ask get her WebTV to working wirelessly with her new internet service. I told my boss to tell her we don't work with hardware that old, but all he see's is dollar signs(client was in Beverly Hills). I drove across the city and fucked with that for like two hours with no avail. She refused to pay me the full amount even though we told her it would be a two hour minimum for an on site visit. Complete waste of time. "
"I had a similar issue with an LG monitor. When I went to the store where I bought it, and they tell me there's nothing they could do about dead pixels unless it's a line. After telling him ""WTF dude, you just sold  me this crap with 2 year extended warranty wich YOU SAID did cover almost anything that official warranty didn't. It costs almost half the retail value and doesn't cover dead pixels?"". Then he comes uncomfortably close and tells me "" EW covers mostly fuckups by the user, wich are not covered by original warranty. If SOMETHING were to happen to this -pointing at the box cointaining the monitor- while you are leaving the store..."" and gave me a big, evil smile. So I walk out of the store, smash the box on the ground with al the force I was able to gather, and come back inside. ""Oops, it slipped from my hands"". After 10 minutes I was going home with a new replacement monitor..."
"This actually reminds me of an embarrassing time in my life as well...

It was late, I was tired and I needed to reach under my desk, which was close to my bed, to finish hooking up the cables to the tower after having taken it apart, cleaned it out and put it back together. Not really thinking, or noticing how close I actually was to the desk itself, i bent down fairly quickly and smashed my forehead on the corner of the desk. I am known to have a fairly hard head, I used to be the guy people would break bags of ice on at parties when I was younger with no issue, but this was different. This was hard enough to crack the edge of the desk and make my head bleed. I don't talk much about that time...

Needless to say, I just fell back into my bed, rolled over, cursed a bit and left it until morning. The kicker? I did it again... f*****g desk..."
"Actually the word demon, or ""daemon"" (it's just alternate/archaic spelling), didn't necessarily have a negative meaning. In ancient Greek mythology and folk-lore demons were resident spirits, doing their thing and ""haunting a place"", nothing more and nothing less. Each demon had a different and distinct personality, although most were annoying and troublesome, but benign and harmless in the end. There was actually the ""agatho-demon"", literally a good one, that lived in every house (not the same demon, each household had a unique one) and provided protection. Of course there are mentions of evil demons, but the definitive 1-on-1 association of demons with evil came with christianity. As a final note, keep this: Making ""daemon"" the name for the background processes is a fine choice, since they are just that, entities residing in a speciffic place and just doing their thing till time's end (or a stupid crash). Thank you!

"If nothing happened, and nothing caused it, there's nothing to be done about it."

Well, that's certainly one way of getting your money's (and/or your warranty's) worth.

""How can I help you?""

""Hi, we just received the new laptop we purchased a few weeks ago, and the screen appears to be crashed --""

"I used to work in property management. One of our tenants was a nightmare, complaining constantly about non-existent nuisances, threatening other tenants, and eventually breaking his lease and moving out mid-month without paying for that month.  Of course he blamed his unhappiness there on the landlord, specifically on me, who wouldn't fix his perceived problems. He was furious and tried getting past me to my boss, threatening to get me fired.  I told him, ""Why do you think I have a job? He pays me to deal with you people so he doesn't have to.  I might actually get a bonus for dealing with you, so thanks."""
"I think I've told this story before but here it is again.

I had a executive assistant come up to me in a panic that she couldn't get to a certain folder on a drive. I ask her what she needed it for while I was checking access and whatnot. She tells me about this weekly procedure she does.

She downloads a group of files from the county, unzips them, and places them into the correct folders. Apparently this is GIS data from the county and they post any changes they've made. And she goes in and makes sure our copy is up to date with theirs.

I fix her issue and decide I'm going to do a mitzvah for the day and make a script that does this for her so she can get her other administrative assistant work done. In 20 minutes I have something that works, it downloads the most current files from the county website, and unzips it into the correct folders using the rules she gave me earlier (something like 'if our copy is newer, leave it' or something - it's been a while).

I call her back and tell her the good news.

""I automated that county task for you - so that GIS data should always be updated. It e-mails you and the GIS team when it's done. So you don't have to do that anymore.""

Silence on the other side of the phone. ""You... automated it? But... That's like 40% of the work I do every week. It takes me 2 days to get it done.""

Two weeks later she was laid off. My check didn't increase at all. I got no kudos from anybody. A woman just lost her job and I was now in charge of making sure a script would always work...

I don't do that kind of thing for other people now. There have been several times where a job has landed in my lap, and I'll automate it so it looks like I'm doing a massive amount of work. But I never do it for my team or other people. I make things that make MY job easier. Doing things for other people tends to get them laid off."
"I'm not sure if deliberate versus accidental was defined. Damage from drops was covered though. I guess the clerk realized that if he didn't help, the guy would just drop it at home and then come back. "

"Pete retired when his time was up, Joe is still in the business, although in the different company now, according to LinkedIn."
"(*sigh*) 

I had an office once where the boss *demanded* the printer be located next to the secretary's desk (instead of a few feet away across a hallway) and the only place to plug it in was under her desk.

I'd be paged out of bed *every day* about the printer. Maybe it was out of paper, and the LCD said ""out of paper"", and the staff was too fucking stupid to read it and would page me that ""the printer is broken again"", so I'd wake up early and take a taxi to the office and add paper *again*. Or more likely, the secretary kicked the power cord out of the outlet *again* and so it had no power, and the staff was too fucking stupid to think ""hmm, it won't turn on, when this happened yesterday it was because the secretary kicked the power cord out of the wall, maybe this black power cord dangling here has some significance."" So they'd page me ""the printer is broken again"" and I'd wake up early and take a taxi to the office and plug the printer in *again*. 

I shit you not, the boss yelled at me ""I thought you said you fixed this printer problem yesterday"" and demanded I get an electrician in to permanently wire the printer into the electrical system so it couldn't be kicked out. (This instead of, say, telling the secretary to be careful, or telling the staff they should learn to plug a damned printer in.) I told him no electrician would be willing to take that job. (I didn't bother telling him that if he got one to do it I'd call the fire marshal in and have the office shut down.) We argued about it for about half an hour every day for about six months.

Every time I'd plug it in, hundreds of pages would spew out, because the whole time it was offline the idiot staff would think ""maybe if I press 'print' again it'll work"", so there'd be a dozen copies of each report, each a dozen or so pages long. I learned there was no win; if I cleared the printer queue I'd have users screaming to the boss that I deleted their irreplaceable print job (why did you delete the original before you had the paper in your hand?) and if I didn't clear it, I'd have users screaming that I didn't clear it and they need their print *now* and why are there hundreds of pages of duplicates of other people's stuff coming out? So I learned to tell them to complain to each other, and ignore it.

(Yes, I know I swore several times. That job earned it.)"
"&gt; So now, somewhere out there today, there is a computer...

...which is named Tiddybonbons or Gerald."

"I had some guy try to return a a computer with a tech service because he just wanted another one. That's fine and dandy but services can't be returned at another store, and it was past 14 days. I told him that, and he blew up. He shoved some papers in my face telling me to ""read it and weep"", even went so far as to question my reading abilities. He kept yelling while I read it, so (I feel bad about this) stop him and say ""are you going to shut up and let me read this out are you going to keep running your mouth?"" He stops talking, and I show him that he has to go to the same store for returning tech services. He goes to my manager, but he says ""that we should have to return the service is your opinion, but it's not fact.""

I tell my manager what I said, and he gave me a fist bump."
