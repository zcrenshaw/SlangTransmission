Your birth is the actual reason your parents mourn on 9/11.
You look like the only reason you're a lesbian is because eating pussy has fewer calories than eating dick.
You look like you showed up to conversion therapy camp in a railroad car
"Welp, there goes our hopes of you eating a bullet."
"Rollin on 24 inch blacked out rims  
Fitbit on my wrist, useless like my limbs  
Wheelin round town droppin lyrical bombs

"Translation:

""Entrepreneur"" = ""Unemployed""

""Inspirer"" = ""Raging Asshole""

In short, the perfect Redditor"
You dress like you dropped out of college.
You look like Liam Neeson was abandoned at birth and raised by a pack of wild menthols
"Champion of ""She LOOKED 18, officer"""
"Whichever one of you wrote ""promise we're not gay"" is one drowsy unplanned sleepover away from a fucking."
I hope you do better at engineering than you do at photo-editing.

&gt; 9 confirmed mental illnesses

Self diagnosed for attention just like your made up date of birth

&gt;roast me harder than life has

=""Give me more attention based on fabricated facts about myself.""  

Not only does everyone see *around* you because you're too self-obsessed to treat yourself to a square meal (let me guess, ""anorexia-nervosa related body dysmorphia,""), but everyone sees *through* you because you trumpet your ""uniqueness"" and ""struggle"" from the mountain top of your depression, despite having never faced a real life challenge, hardship, or slight inconvenience.  "
The nose is for crayons.
"When white people say they have a black friend, they mean you."
"Yeah, but at least i don't have to put up with a mom *and* an aunt at thanksgiving. "
Hahahaha that killed me faster than the anorexia was
That bra is about as useful as the coathanger your mum used
Why the fuck is the cripple wearing a fitbit?
Being a virgin doesn't count as a minority. 
"Yeah, the only thing she blows is lunch."
"An aspiring rapper AND stuck in a chair? Are all of your songs about being a disappointment to your father, Ludacripple?"
See fire? After what the last one did to your face?
"Still trying to pick up high school girls? Hey baby, I've got a driver's license and can buy cigarettes."
"I can't tell what is worse. You begging for attention here, even though it's negative, or you begging for compliments repeatedly on every other sub http://i.imgur.com/1LrtbPp.jpg"
You look like the step before Neanderthal on the evolutionary chart of the human race 
"Well, at least that college is safe from a shooter."
"wild guess: anorexia, narcissistic personalty disorder, bulimia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, alcohol &amp; drug dependence, and OCD."
You look like the only dike that can't retain water
"Jesus, the only thing that needs to be roasted is some food for you. You look like a hungry skeleton that just got out of Auschwitz."
"When black people say they have a white friend, they also mean you"
"of course you're not gay,  gay people actually have coherent senses of fashion"
Is your self esteem as high as your hairline?
This page looks like a character selection screen in League of Letdowns. 
"You're insecure enough to insult everyone whilst proclaiming your virtues. You must have very thin-skin. Perhaps any insult at all will deeply upset you. 

While I cannot insult your physique, I can insult your intelligence. You've already established yourself to be lacking in self-awareness, and it's known that most philosophers and inspirers don't boast of themselves in order to gain internet sympathy. 

You're likely a pedantic and third-rate philosopher who may have a collection of mediocre writing samples and thoughts as token evidence. It's more than likely you are the opposite of an inspirer, seeing as inspirers are confident people who can believe in themselves without putting others down and boasting themselves up.

In short, your statement has persuaded me that you are neither a capable philosopher nor inspirer. A thin body doesn't equal talent for abstract thought and interpersonal skills. But, because you lack self-awareness, you may indeed be a capable software-developer. 

"
You look like a constipated kylo ren.
"The ""Fuck me now or I'll tell the cops you raped me"" psycho look."
"There's no way you're going to convince me that you don't lay in bed together at night looking at that map while fantasizing about travelling to far off land together. The world is your oyster, complete that pearl necklace"
"Unlike your birthday cake and birthday dinner, those towers stayed down."
"You look like the kind of guy that tried to join a frat, got kicked out for making an ass of himself, and still tries to act as ""frat""  as possible to hold on to the one point in your life you thought you were somewhat popular. "
"You're a rapper? Sorry, dude, but the Special Olympics is the only track you're ever going to be on. "
"&gt; ""Philosopher"" = ""**Pot-smoking** High School Dropout""

Probably more accurate."
Holy shit
"Good idea: going on a date in a poorly lit place so he/she/it can't get a good look at your face.

Bad idea: being so attention starved that you have to make a roast thread while out to eat.

Worse idea: wearing an ugly ass shirt on a date that bunches up around your almost nonexistent tits.

He walks too fast for me to keep up. You'd think all this mouthbreathing I do would get me enough oxygen to catch him...
"Dear Amanda,

"ANTI-ROAST: Some Android phones have a beautification feature that is a bitch to turn off. So it might not be their fault, it's not like they are rocket scientists."
"You look like you just smelled your own fart. It probably smells like a combination of protien shake, creatine, and your boyfriends manjuice."

"Well, that makes two things that didn't change since 7th grade: the experimental nature of your friendship and your clothing.     
You're like the junior highschool version of 21 Jumpstreet with a hint of Glee.

You can buy the nicest Air Jordan's since you will never have to worry about getting them dirty.

Wouldn't an entrepreneur find a solution to a problem and do just that, not ask reddit where to find a job that does that?

Okay so he's not a dev/entrepreneur. What about an inspirer and philosopher?

one of these people that all they do is talk about the 'mental illnesses' they have - she hides behind these because she has no substance otherwise - she's not interesting or different or special and she knows it so she latched herself on to all this bull shit  - look at her post history haha omg - its literally her taking every fucking chance she can to tell people about her 'mental illnesses' fucking get over yourself. Id love to know what the fucking PTSD is from - your grand mommy pass away when you were 8? did someone micro agrees you out front of the thrift store? you never been thru a fucking struggle in your life and probably have 2 parents paying for all your bulshit docs and therapists and meds etc. what a fucking disappointment. In all fairness even if you gained weight you just look like another regular thick eyebrow white girl normie with zero fucking flavor but I'm guessing you know that so you try to be the 'damaged and ruined manic pixie'. i know I'm ranting but this chik is such a literal fucking cliche if i saw you as a character in a movie i would be like -''jesus christ they're really over doing it and trying to hard with the 'omg look at me I'm broken and damaged and issues and problems' edge dyke character - this is too much''
sad part (not really) is you will never grow out of this bc you made it your identity - thats why you'll be alone for ever bc its not that people don't want to be around people with mental illnesses - that would be mean - its that people don't want to be around an empty human with no personality so they created one by acquiring as many fakeable 'disorders' as she can manage to google. no one wants to hear you talk about that bullshit when its just for attention. your parents know its for attention. everyone around you does. thats why your on the internet looking for more attention. now that you got your self pity fuel take that old wooden box from under your bed - the one decorated with shitty emo band logos you doodled and other 'dark hot topic-alt girl' fodder, open it up and take out your favorite blade or knife and get to slicing up those inner thighs. then don't forget to take pics of it to send to who ever pretends to care and talk post all about it on tumblr."
