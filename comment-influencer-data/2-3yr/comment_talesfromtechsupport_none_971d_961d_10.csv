Well.. you did warn them.
I've always warned them since a colleague opened the drawer while the user was still under the desk and they lifted their head and knocked the float all over the floor.
"That's very devilish, ingenious and I love you (not like that please don't take me to HR). You are a paragon of luser correction."

This is how identify theft happens. You come up with a grand story that seems plausible in order to gain information you shouldn't have access to.

"By using magic the user will never learn how dumb they were. Or even worst, user now will carry a screw driver to ~~do~~ try magic unsupervised. "
"Had this *art teacher* never heard of, say, ancient Greek and Roman sculptures? So many of them have support structures worked into the design, otherwise they'd fall over and/or break themselves. I learned that in middle school art class. 

3D printers might be new, but designing for your materials is not. You'd expect an *art teacher* of all people to know that. If your object is not balanced it'll fall over. If you exceed the tensile strength of your material, it'll break. If you're working with something new, take the instructions seriously, that's what they're for. "
I love this guy already.

"Bonus mini story.  I once overheard a coworker saying things like, ""Let's restart RoseTyler,"" and ""Can we remote into RiverSong again?""  That coworker had never heard of Doctor Who, but apparently the customer he was talking to was a big fan."
Bet your ass I answer every call with that.

"I've read this somewhere.  I knew the DIVO would tell him what I did, and it wasn't the place of me to correct him in front of the Aircrew."
"I have a CRAZY theory about this but it might explain it. 


Lodge is a company that makes kitchen appliances and other things. They're kind of well known for their (you guessed it) *frying pans*. 


For this I shall refer to the confused old lady as $OL. 


$OL googles Lodge because of the charge. Users will be users, so she googles Loge by accident. Loge leads to Logitech. Logitech and Lodge sound similar, and if you're always somewhat confused in some way, they seem to be the same. 


Logitech gets google ad for your company because google ads. Assuming that computers are magic, she calls your company, under the impression that she has called Lodge. 


OR


$OL looks up kitchenware. Ware leads to hardware. $OL thinks that hard/software are named that chefs use (cooking jargon). She looks up hardware. Hardware leads to Google ad with your company. 


OR


She mistyped the phone number (most likely)


Edit: WOAH! "
"Once you mentioned the fact that you had to tell him what was the difference between the zip code and telephone it was going to be insane.

"Electrician Nuke. I have, in fact, turned the ship off and on again.

It was very exciting and involved a lot of swearing, but the whole thing went dark for about 10 seconds. Good times."
"It's often said that this is what you get with older people, but I find that this occurs most often in bureaucratic drones.  Yes there's a giant overlap in the Venn diagram, but simply being alive a few more years isn't the root cause.

The issue is where people go about their work life doing whatever mind-numbing grind of a task they are paid a pittance to do just because ""it's always been done that way."" Combine this with the expectation of reprisal for doing anything differently than how they were first trained to do it a decade earlier, and you have sheer panic anytime anything changes."
Such classic idiocy. I've once been asked by a family member where were the sunglasses... located on the head of said family member 
"He has access to all his staff's email?

God damn, that's pretty fucked up. I don't think that's legal where I am.

edit: Cool, I get it, it's company policy at a lot of terrible companies presumably in the US, doesn't make it right. Here they cannot do that so readily, nor can they use security cameras to spy on employees regular activities and use the footage to reprimand them, unless a crime has taken place.

edit 2: wow, did not expect so many of you to be reprehensible shitstains in regards to common decency ""blah blah blah The Company owns everything you write!!!111"" those people are part of everything that is wrong in this world. People have a right to privacy, I'm not saying jack-off on company time but I am saying that monitoring everything you say or do is utterly reprehensible and not ethical in the slightest. Especially with some of the fucked up examples you people have given including *specifically looking through somebody's email to come up with excuses to fire them because you couldn't find a real one that stands up legally*. If you don't see how fucked up that is, there's something wrong with you."

Did the replenishment ship's windbirds have names before or after you called and asked for them to be put on?
She's lucky it wasn't bricked before she realized.
"The mind blowing part of that was ""it says the caps lock is on, but it isn't on"". Did they actually say that? I don't understand how a person can be that stubborn. It's not even you telling them. The computer is telling them."

"Speaking from experience, most *art teachers* wouldn't know engineering and architecture if it clubbed them upside the head.

Most *art teachers* think that what holds up a tree is *art*, not the complicated skeletal(1) structure of the tree.  I have seen an experienced art teacher attempt to cut down a tree limb *while standing on the same limb* like they were in some Looney Tunes cartoon.

(1) Yes, trees have 'skeletons'.  Engineering-wise."
"It's hilarious working on a corporate helpdesk with a bunch of other 20-something guys and watching them leap to help any young woman who comes by, following them around like lost puppies. 

I, however, am a combination of lazy and ugly that I know I don't have a chance with any of them, and don't feel like volunteering for the extra work anyway."
"Liz sounds like a stereotype that I witnessed a few times in my career so far: Young women, just got out of school/university, using her good looks and feminine charm to grease the wheels of IT or any other poor gullible chap to get her every need catered to more quickly.

At least she owned up to the idiocy.
"I asked myself this question often. When I am having a difficult day, I tell myself now ""well, at least I know how to use a keyboard, so I can't be doing that bad."""
"reminds me of when I was a bartender (at a students bar).   
Got too drunk and fell asleep, so when closing down my fellow bartender thought it would be funny to put the float on my stomach and turn up the sound system with Eiffel 65's Blue on repeat.   
Fun times waking up in the dark with a hangover and having to collect and sort all the coins I just spilled over the floor, luckily after having managed to change the music. And he also left a note telling me that his closing inventory count was way off, so I had to redo it.   
Guess I had it coming though."
Sounds like you are better off without that sale.
"You know what's even more evil than having the ability to remotely start a piece of industiral machinery? 

The ability to start the pre-start warning klaxon, even when the safety interlocks are in place. People tend to question whether their lockout is in the correct place or not, in that situation.

"I had one similar to this once.  User calls me over in a panic, ""My spreadsheet won't update and we need to get this data out in 10 minutes!!  You gotta fix this right away.""


Having no idea what his spreadsheet is or what the issue might be, I go over and ask him to show me what's happening.


He has the spreadsheet open and clicks on a button to run a macro.  A dialogue box pops up immediately, which he closes and still in his panicked voice says, ""See?!  It keeps doing that!  It's not supposed to do that, it should run the update macro to get the new data and we need this now!""


I calmly ask him, ""ok, can you do that gain and let me read the message that pops up?""


He says, ""Sure, but it does it every time and we don't have any time left!""

He clicks the button for the macro, the dialogue pops up, and he clicks that OK button so fast to clear the dialogue message that you'd think his life depended on it.  I sigh and ask him, ""ok do it again, but this time don't click that OK button so I can read what the message says.""


He's getting more irritated, Clicks the macro button, dialogue pops up, and reflexively he clicks the damn button again!  And again, so fast that no human could read the error message in the dialogue box.


Now I'm getting frustrated, and ask him if I can do it for him.  This annoys him even further, as he's clicking the macro button again, he's asking, ""Can't you just go fix whatever's causing this to pop up, it's not anything I did on my end, it must be on the servers or something...""


At this point the dialogue pops up and he manages to restrain from clicking the OK button to clear it.  We both read the message that says, ""You have another instance of this spreadsheet open.  Close it before running this macro.""

We both look down at his taskbar where we see another instance of the same spreadsheet.  He closes it, reruns the Macro, no error...and he doesn't even say thanks.  He was in a hurry after all.  :/

Shopkeeper: I have the usual one inch and 20mm fuses. What size and current rating do you need?

Idiot: I don't know, I will come back later

Idiot returns later with a blown fuse

Shopkeeper: Here you go, fifty pence.

Later:

Angry idiot: This fuse blew straight away! You sold me a faulty fuse! I want my money back!

A month later

A different customer: Do you sell fuses?

Shopkeeper: No.

"I can't even fathom how many times I've seen that kind of things happening. 
People are scared of error messages. The more ""threatening"", the less they read. Seeing a error message creates a pavlovian reflex of calling IT. "
"The user was stuck in a loop - luckily, there's a simple fix: an on-site tech needed to locate them and initiate a local reset; unfortunately current technology doesn't allow this to be done remotely (although research into FoIP continues). The reset is normally achieved by temporarily interrupting the user's thought process - ideally by application of a LART or clue-by-four, although in a pinch a large rock or stout stick may be a suitable substitution.  
The user may experience some slight discomfort during and immediately following the reset process, but this is normally short-lived and only of a minor inconvenience to the technicians."
