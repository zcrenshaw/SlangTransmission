0,"Early this summer I woke up and it was a beautiful day, sunny warm and clear. My wife went to work and I was supposed to drop off my six year old daughter at school and go to my job. After she left, and I don't really know why, I phoned the school and told them my daughter was sick and then phoned my work and told them I couldn't come in.

We spent the day goofing around at the play park, getting ice cream, riding our bikes and building sand castles. On the way back I changed her into her school uniform and we arrived back just in time to pretend she was coming back from school.

I don't think the school ever mentioned it to my wife and as far as I know my daughter never told either. I know school is important and so is work, but sometimes, just sometimes, a sunny day with my kid has to come first."
1,"Take the house.  Think of all of the income that will free up for you.  Think of the freedom it will give you and your wife to seek out jobs that are fulfilling, if not necessarily lucrative.  Financial stability is good for a marriage.

But if you are being asked to sign a prenup, make sure you get your own lawyer to cover your ass.  (Not your wife's lawyer, or her family's lawyer, as he or she will have a conflict of interest).  That may not seem romantic, but neither is signing a prenup to begin with.  

Edit:  I was not in this situation, but have a coworker who was.  Dude has a big ass house and does not worry about money.  He seems to have survived just fine.

Edit2:  Also, if your wife's family has the money to drop $500k on a house for you, they have the money to drop on a good lawyer to draft the prenup.  So, don't skimp on your lawyer.

2,"Not a dad, but two incidents come to mind:

* In high school, as is to be expected, I had just learnt of the joys of alcohol. So I used to sneak a little bit of whiskey from the bottle and enjoy. However, knowing that my dad didn't drink often, he'd definitely notice the level of the whiskey bottle going down. So, ""jeenyus"" me at the time thought it'd be a good idea if I just, you know, mixed a little water in to kinda raise the level back up a bit. 

About two days after I did that, I come home and my dad is sitting there, waiting for me. He goes ""Here"" and busts open a brand new bottle of whiskey and pours me a small tiny amount in a glass.

""Don't tell your mother, she wanted me to yell at you. Have a drink, I suppose this day had to come sooner or later. But boy, listen to me - I don't have a problem with you drinking as long as you use your brain cells about it, don't overdo it and don't drive when you've even had a single drink. And whatever you do, don't ruin my damn scotch again."" 

* When my sister was having her first kid, my mom flew over to the States to help out with the delivery and be there in case she needed  anything, leaving Dad behind for a while until after the baby was born. I was working at my first job and thought I'd pop down home to surprise dad and see how he was holding up by himself, considering that he's never been without mom for years. 

I go home and made the discovery that my dad...""regresses"" to bachelor man when my mom isn't around. I come home to find Neil Diamond blaring from the hi-fi, he's hooked up the PS3 I left behind and playing Forza on it and there's a cat that usually hangs about the building that's now inside the flat. My dad is walking around without a shirt, in his shorts and flip flops, cooking himself fish fry for lunch and happily singing along. 

He takes one look at me and goes ""Do not tell your mother."". Later that day, I'm on a call with my mom to find out about my sister and she tells me she was worried and that dad must be miserable without her. It was all I could do to keep from laughing. "

4,"&gt;Me and my SO have fallen into the trap of always initiating sex in the same way. We're beginning to find this a bit boring and want some different ways in which we can both initiate. 

My advice is not so much about new ways to initiate, as how to maintain readiness. Here are some tips I've shared before.

Girls like it when you fondle their . . . minds. 

There are two parts to sexual tension: 

* Build-up: flirting, foreplay, etc.

* Release: sex.

Where some guys go wrong is trying to skip from build-up to release. This usually fails. Like trying to pop an empty balloon. The better the build-up, the greater the release. 

If you get the build-up right, the release will almost take care of itself. You and your partner *will* find ways to release. Often spontaneous, exciting ways that are better than what you could have planned. Initiating will happen (by you or her) nearly effortlessly.

There's a saying that men are like microwaves and women are like ovens. Men get horny fast and it's over fast. Women are slower to heat up but last longer.

What I've found works best when flirting in a relationship is to consistently keep your girl at a simmer, so she's always more open to the idea of sexy times. 

You might tap into her lust that day, you might not. You have that luxury to choose. Sometimes it builds up so much passion that she has to jump on you instead.

Her mind is a major erogenous zone. Words, metaphors and imagery can be a huge turn-on. Language and hints are her porn.

Ideas:

* Physical affection and touching.

* Flirting and teasing. Talk, phone calls, text. 

* Do romantic things for her--*outside* of normal holidays. Big gestures can come off as desperate and needy. I've found little things can be deadly effective, e.g. cute post-it notes, a pack of her favorite snack on her desk at work, etc. 

* Hot tip: if you know when she's on her period or going through tough times and do something nice for her unexpectedly (like when you're not there with her), it's 10x more powerful. Thoughtfulness trumps the amount of money spent. 

Women seem to love little pleasant surprises and variety. Don't do it all the time to the point you drown her in affection and kill the effect; enough to get her excited once in a while and keep her on her toes.

The key is to *don't do these things only when you want sex that day*. Women figure that out fast and feel manipulated. That's when they start to get suspicious and resentful whenever you do something nice for them, because they think a request for sex is coming.

The foreplay started with that compliment you gave her on the hot new dress she bought last week. Foreplay is an ongoing process. On the flip side, maybe she's denying sex now because you argued with her best friend six months ago.

Easier to flirt all the time, but not escalate to sex every time. Make it a lottery, not an ATM transaction. Random, unpredictable payoffs are addictive (ask any gambler).

Don't spend 100 percent of your time with her. You have work, hobbies and friends, a well-rounded life. Give her the gift of missing you. Ideally, she should be drowning in sexy anticipation, wondering when you're going up and ravish her. 

If it's a new relationship and you've hooked up with her a few times: when you're out of bed, remind her of a specific detail. Something she would associate with sexy times. A special naughty secret only you two would know. Make it a secret game for only the two of you.

I did this accidentally the first few times by being flirty and goofy and just trying to make things fun. Eventually I caught on to the effect it had on girls. 

For example, there was a girl who liked to tie her hair back before we would get down to it. Sometimes, I'd hold her long hair in my hand instead.

* One time, she was washing her face. I saw some hairs straying, so I helpfully swept back some of her hair and gripped it in my hand. She shivered a little and immediately gave me *that* look. That was by accident, before I realized it was a turn-on. It was like Pavlovian conditioning, where she associated the feeling of her hair in my hand with intimacy.

* She texted me she was coming over. I jokingly texted her back: ""Bring a hair strap."" Then I went back to watching TV and promptly forgot about it. She told me later that drove her wild. She couldn't drive fast enough.

* At a boring party, I whispered in her ear: ""Let's get out of here and go somewhere you can put your hair up for me."" She grabbed my hand and pulled me along into an empty room.

* If you're feeling daring and risque, reference that sexy thing with innocent-sounding language when you're both among other people. ""Ah yes, my girlfriend always has the prettiest hair straps,"" you say, while giving her a knowing, naughty look. Warning: some girls are horrified by this. Others get embarrassed but also crazy turned-on and will act on it with you later in private. 

* Send her a flirty reference just when she's arrived at work. Girls *hate* it that they're all turned on but stuck at work thinking about doing it all day long. Let her lust build. Sexual tension builds precisely when it cannot be released. Brace yourself to get pounced on when she gets home. I once texted her a picture of a hair strap in my hand. No message.

Mix it up: spoken, written, visual, little actions. Feel free to get creative. 

Let her get turned on and writhe in anticipation because she doesn't know when you'll make your move. It's okay to drive her crazy this way. She secretly desires that sweet torture. 

It's not manipulation, it's appreciation. You're making the extra effort to keep things exciting.

Other examples:

* One girl had this set of high-heeled shoes she always wore when she wanted to seduce me. If she came over wearing those shoes, you knew it was on. She'd rub one foot against the other ankle to draw my eyes to her legs.

* One girl would spray on this special perfume she knew drove me crazy. When saying hello she'd hug me extra tight so I'd smell her.

* One girl would reference the time we were late for a party because we were having too much fun fooling around. She'd say things like, ""Well, we could always be *late* . . . ""

Every girl has her ""hair strap."" What's your girl's?

Remember it. Remind her of it. Have fun.

Warning: this can backfire. Once a girl gets into it she'll often turn the tables and start doing sexy things to turn *you* on all the time. Their creativity at being naughty knows no limits when unleashed. 

The kinds of phone calls, texts and photos you get from a girl who's running hot are mind-blowing. Imagine getting more material than you can keep up with. A nice problem to have.

Hot tip: respect her in public, but keep seducing her in private. A guy who ""gets it"" like that is a rare prize for women. 

This is a mind shift, but experiment with treating your mission as your SO and your SO as your mistress. I think some women like that they don't have to bear the burden of being your world, your everything. 

She's the fun escape from work; she's the sexy distraction that pulls you away from time to time. Helps to keep up the flirty vibe.

Hope this helps."
5,"Father here. My daughter was 7 or 8 when one day I picked her up from school, and before going home we stopped at a cafe, where she of course talked me into buying her icecream and coke. I had espresso and a bottle of fizzy water. We spent some time there, finished everything off then we left. 

Back in the car, on the way home I hit a bump on the road and the jolt made me burp a little of that fizzy water. Before I could apologise my daughter answers the burp with one of her own, coke-fuelled, a serious made-on-purpose burp. I did not know she could do that, I glanced her way, she was smiling and had her clever face on. She knew she'd surprised me. So I looked for another bump in the road, found it, burped louder. She answered burp for burp - it was our first ever burping competition, it ended in much laughter and myrth between dad and daughter.  
*Don't tell your mum* was obligatory by the time we pulled up at home. She didn't, and we continue to have the occasional burping competition today - when mum is out of earshot. "
6,"Tell your neighbor that you are going to be trying some different things with your alarm to see if you can keep from bothering them.

However, you can't not start your car... so that's going to continue to be a problem."
7,"&gt;my alarm clock and my car ... are too loud for her and the tenet downstairs....

Try parking your car downstairs."
8,Wonder what the fuck knocked me down from an eleven. 
9,"Remove EVERYTHING from the room, and I mean EVERYTHING. Then all of you go in there and sit down. Last one to remain in the room gets it."
10,"The amount of times I've gotten dating advice from girls that amounted to ""You just need to wait for the right girl to come to you"" makes me think most girls have no idea how dating works for guys. They just project their own experiences on men and assume that they're the same."
11,"Houston doesn't have a space shuttle.


When they retired the last four space shuttles, they went to cities in New York, Florida, California, and Virginia.

Houston is ""Space City"" and the location of NASA headquarters, and we didn't get a space shuttle.

""Houston"" was the first word spoken on the moon, and we didn't get a space shuttle.

The area code to call the International Space Station is a Houston area code, and we didn't get a fucking space shuttle.

Whoever made that decision is an asshole."

16,Getting laid apparently 
17,"This is not all guys, but It can get pretty nasty when talking about what you WOULD with a woman, or what you HAVE done in a consensual situation, but someone admitting that they sexually touch a woman before they can even consent is beyond horrible. Guys like to brag about what they can do with a woman that will make the woman love them or what they did with the woman that makes you the man. Saying you'll assault them will usually have everyone around looking at you with disbelief. Most men are outraged about sexual assault or rape like women are. "
18,That's making the assumption that two unattractive people are going to be attracted to each other as well tho
19,"do not act in a way that might imply that you're a couple

if you are talking about him do not oversell him

if you pick up signals of interest or disinterest from a woman he's chatting up let him know, you're probably more adapt a tthis that any male wingman

"
20,"We match, she's really pretty and a freakin' doctor.  Cool.  Send a few dozen messages back and forth.  She always responds with very short answers, and in dozens of texts she hasn't asked me a SINGLE question about me.  She's not interested, whatever, I take the hint and let it die out (not too hard in this case).


A few days later she asks her first question:  Why haven't I been messaging her lately?  I told her there wasn't any natural flow to the conversations.  She then tells me I must be a horrible conversationalist, because she's always very easy to talk to.


Oddly, if somebody had just outright insulted me or similar I'd be less irked by this.  But the idea that she genuinely believes the problem lies elsewhere, to me, says a lot more about a person. "
21,"Immaturity?  Ignorance.  I think society is built around the concept of taking from others makes you bigger.

We bullied a kid in middle school, he killed himself.  It was suddenly clear that these things are bigger than joking around.   "
22,"Did we match with the same girl? I matched with this girl a second time, I said ""I think we've matched before"", she immediately shot back with ""well you're probably one of those assholes that stops messaging"", I replied ""actually I think you never replied to my last message"", she said ""well you must've bored me"", I said ""oh that's handy, guy stops messaging its his fault, you stop messaging its his fault, maybe the real problem is that you're a bit of a cunt and that's why you're still single"". Took longer than I expected to get unmatched."
23,"For bullshit reasons that are stupid and I hate them, I am pretty much forced to live about 9 hours away from my son, who lives with his mother. I don't get to see him nearly as often as I would like. Between his summer vacation, spring break, and Christmas break that he spends most of with me, I go down to visit on weekends when I can.

One time when I was down there, a new game had come out that he loved, and it was his birthday so he had just gotten it. We were having a blast playing it together when his mother got all ""you know it's not healthy to sit around all day and play video games"" and suggested we go for a hike down some nature trail nearby. Now I know all-day video gaming isn't healthy, but it was his birthday weekend and he *just* got this game the day before, he's been *waiting* for this game to come out, and the day before the poor kid couldn't even *play* the thing because there were guests over for his party and it would have been rude.

Not wanting to argue with her in front of him, we got our shoes on and got into my car. He was a little depressed about it until I told him that the plan was to go to the park with the trails, take like 9 or 10 pictures that look different enough that we can show her, then fuck off to the arcade for a few hours. If his mom asks, yes we went for a hike and it was fun. Both of these things are true - we had fun faking that we were there all day.

We had an absolute blast at the arcade.

Not a super interesting one, but it stands out for me because he absolutely loved every second of it."
24,"This isn't OP's fault. If your alarm is so loud it wakes up neighbors, it's probably the apartments fault not yours. I can't even hear my roommates alarm."
25,"Ryan Reynolds is like the male Jennifer Aniston. Not supernaturally, impossibly handsome like, say, Matt Bomer where you wonder if someone distilled all the impurities out of his DNA strands. Ryan is proof that if you're pretty cute, and then toss in good grooming, clothes and quality time at the gym on top of that, you can really make the most out of what you've got."

27,"It really depends on the men in question. Some will be fairly civil even in private, but I do have certain friends who seem to live for sex gossip. But, I don't think that's what you're talking about.

Most of that locker room talk comes from men trying to keep converstation funny, especially in the work place. When you're trying to crack jokes all the time, you end up going for a lot of low hanging fruit. Dick jokes, fart jokes, pseudo homosexual shit, the whole morning drive time radio thing. 

Yes, there's a lot of vulgar locker room talk, but it's because we're always trying to make a funny with each other, and sex funnies are easiest to make.

Also, we're not allowed to sexually harass the women, so we sexually harass each other."
28,"Obese. I'm fine with chubby or even a little fat, I'm no model of health either. But I do try to take care of myself and be healthy, and someone who just doesnt care and is obese, I just cant do that.

"
29,You gotta be good looking to be aloof and successful with women.
30,"&gt; I'm always terrified to go talk to guys because I assume they're already getting a bunch of girls bothering them and they'd think it was weird.

Haha, I am sorry, but this is too funny.

31,"If I were to end up single again, I can't imagine I'd be very interested in doing all that again. But if a multimillionaire model decided I was desirable, I'd lock that shit down."
32,Become a subreddit moderator

35,"As a lawyer, seconding this advice. A good lawyer will prevent chicanery by her family motivated by either ill intent towards you or of their need to protecttheir daughter overshadows their respect for her choice to marry you."
36,"Sometimes my wife will call me and ask what I'm up to, and I'll tell her I'm sitting at home playing video games or watching TV or something. Apparently, to her, that sounds a lot like, ""I'm being tortured by my loneliness, please help"" rather than, ""I'm relaxing and enjoying the quiet, and it's really pretty nice""."
37,"When people say want to ""Tone Up"", or talk about how this specific supplement they started using has made the world of difference. 

Basically anything fitness related. A proper diet and hard work is all thats needed. Supplements are typically not beneficial. You can't ""tone"" your muscles. And spot reduction without surgery is not possible. "
38,"I have no idea.

40,"Because I was a dumb kid and I didn't know he was gay, all I knew was that he was different and acted funny.  "
41,"Why would you want to date someone if you aren't interested in what they have to say? 

Small talk doesn't have to be about the weather, it's just a way of  broadly getting to know someone until you hit upon something you connect on and can talk more deeply about."
42,"I'm very sorry for your loss. This thread is a bit more serious than the title may imply.

I think there is a key difference between feeling empty as a teenager and feeling depressed. I would say feeling empty as a teenager is somewhat normal, all the things that teenagers desire (privacy, freedom, a sense of purpose) they really don't get from the educational system. I remember as a teenager feeling more eager to move on with my life than I ever have as an adult and not being content with your life at that point seemed more than norm than an outlier.

I think though, there is a fundamental difference between feeling a little empty and being clinically depressed. Which is a genuine illness. I don't suffer from depression, but I've known others who have and it takes it up to a differing level to simply feeling a bit 'empty' which is fairly normal in most stages of your life (especially as a teen).

From the situations of this that I've heard, I think its fairly normal for someone to be battling deep depression on the inside but appear somewhat normal to others and on the outside. While there are signs, someone may appear functional but still struggle inside."
43,Get them into therapy and keep them active. Don't expect them to want to do either and be understanding.

45,This is one of the sweetest moments I've ever heard about.
46,"Not a father, but while on leave home from basic I smoked a joint with my best friend and my dad on the way to a Bob Dylan concert. My mom always thought he stopped smoking long before he met her, but he would smoke on rare occasions when he could. Only time we ever smoked together. I don't think we've ever even talked about it since.

The best part is my parents came with me when I finalized my paperwork with the recruiter about six months earlier and he confirmed ""Okay, so you used to smoke weed but stopped a year ago, right?"" And my mom gasped. When we were driving home she teared up a little and said ""I always thought you were a good kid who never did that stuff. Honey! Tell your son what he did was wrong!"" And my dad goes ""Uhh, yeah. What your mother said."""

76,"I'm not going to try to feed you the ""no man will ever be remotely disappointed in anything he sees on a naked woman"" line because it's a pretty wild exaggeration. 

But men are also well aware that real women aren't paintings. We know body parts won't be perfectly symmetrical. We don't expect every inch of your skin to be evenly colored. We know scars stick around and that birth marks are a thing. 

If a guy's an asshole, he's an asshole. You can't really do anything about that. Same with women. Bitches are going to be bitches. 

Especially if it's something you can't change, then the best thing you can do is stop worrying about it. Acting insecure is going to repel far more men than a few stretch marks or a darker labia."

83,"When my best man and I were living close to one another, we decided to hang out, and he brought his 3-4 y.o. daughter with him.  We biked over to a pizza place, and grabbed a slice and a beer.  We got to talking, and soon enough I was late for a date with my now wife.  We dropped money on the counter and BOOKED it out of there.  He got his daughter onto the back of the bike, we pedaled as fast as we could, and managed to make it back to his place in time for me to grab my car and head home.  His daughter was LOVING it.  She was laughing and waving at everyone, and we were enjoying the hell out of ourselves until we pulled into the driveway, and dismounted.  His face went slack and he muttered, ""...oh shit..."" to himself and I stood there confused.  He slowly reached out and picked her up out of her seat and said, ""We never buckled her in.""

I am forbidden from ever telling this story to his wife, and he was watching his daughter like a hawk for a couple of days to make sure she didn't say anything."
84,"Almost 2 years ago, she took care of me all weekend when I was sick. Furthermore, I didn't even ask her for help of any sorts; all I did was to say that I was not feeling well when replying to a text of hers that asked me to go on an all-day outing with her. Not long after this, she showed up at my apartment, and proceeded to give me medicine as needed, and cooked hot food for me. She stayed at my place overnight, and didn't leave until she was sure I was feeling well.

This happened only seven months into our relationship, and you bet I am still with her today."
85,"One chick spoke to me eloquently and we chatted for two days about life. On the second night, says she's super turned on and wants to meet for drinks. I was out with friends, I picked the closest bars within 10 minutes of me and told her I was game.  Send her the info. She scoffs and calls me a desperate small dick Asian. Sad thing is she's not the first racist I've come across. Really turned me off to Tinder. "

That's exactly what you do"

It's a beautiful thing."
91,"Incest. I find it unbelievable how many people will say stuff like ""it's none of my business what two consenting adults do in their bedroom!"" and do a complete 180 when someone wants to fuck their cousin. Like it's totally acceptable to be against incest because of the ""ew factor,"" but if you try to make that argument with homosexuality, people will be all over your ass. It's such a monumental double standard.

I also don't like the pedophile witch hunt mentality people tend to have. Pedophiles have inherently done nothing wrong by being attracted to children. You don't get to choose what you're attracted to. That shit should be considered a legitimate mental illness.

This year I've been with a 21 year old and a 22 year old, and while they were both very attractive, I couldn't stand to be around them.  It like I was hanging out with a younger sister or something.

101,"I think my honest answer might be that most women I've dated have been unaware that I don't need a boss.

Okay so call me an asshole but in a marriage there is no ""yours"" and ""hers"" anymore. There's just both of yours. Literally. In the eyes of the law that is how you both need to start treating your home and material affects.

Anyway, I don't think I would feel very comfortable either. Your house is a place where you need to feel like you have your hands on the reigns. You must trust your wife if you married her. But I don't think it's very fair for you to have to hinge such a large part of your comfort in your home on her word. And based on this post, her word alone isn't going to be enough is it? 

&gt;I also feel that she has grown up a little more naive and relaxed with her lifestyle...I can't help but harbor these feelings of paranoia and emasculation from the idea of being taken care of by my fiancé's family.

I'm certain that I've had dozens of crude conversations in the past which would prove catastrophically embarrassing, if it ever turned out that they'd been recorded.  It's bad enough that they're preserved in my memory, even if no one else ever remembers them.  I can hardly believe some of the vile shit I've said out loud.

I never endorsed groping women, or gloated about inappropriate behavior  toward them.  That Trump is on tape doing both is a real black eye, for him (or it would be, if he were capable of anything resembling shame).  But to anyone who's particularly fired up about this news item, I would suggest that you consider the mass of terrible things you've said, when you didn't think (or didn't realize) you were being recorded.

When I was maybe 9 or 10 my dad bought me a go cart from the local lawn mower place. After a while he decided it wasn't running right and pulled the governor.

Obviously it wasn't crazy fast or anything but it ran way better. We lived way off a dirt road in the woods so my local driving path involved going down the road and up a hill into our pasture.

One day I was driving it and decided to do a doughnut halfway up the hill. On the first turn my go cart did a flip that landed me at the bottom.

Somewhere along the way my leg shot out and the go cart landed on it. I was hobbling my way back up the road in a panic but my dad met me half way. He said to walk normal and if my mom ever found out he'd take the go cart away. I don't think she ever found out."

134,"A bit late to the party but I thought I'd share. Not a Dad.

As a young teen, I'm on holiday with my parents. It was a typical ""relaxation"" holiday with not much to do but walk the set walks. After a few days my Dad suggests we go fishing by the sea. My Mum hates fishing so it's just ""us men spending time together"" as she'd call it.

So we get down past the beach, climb up onto these rocks and start setting up. Just as we start to setup, a group of older teens/young adults get to the beach and start undressing into beachwear. Tops off, bathing suits on, all of them - except for one. 

Definitely the best looking woman of the group. She's still fully clothed, faffing around with her bag, setting up her parasol, putting towels down... beach stuff. 10 minutes pass, still fully clothed.

Finally after about 15 minutes, she starts getting changed into her bikini and I hear my Dad mutter ""Well, good things come to those who wait..."" and I mumbled a sort of ""Mmhm.""

We both freeze, look at each other, look back at the fishing stuff and realize that neither of us had done anything in the past 15 minutes. Both just waiting. Innocent enough I think - just a couple of father-son perverts... 

It's not the happiest or fondest memory but it's definitely one where I think ""Yeaa he's definitely my Dad."""
135,"I haven't thought about this in over a decade, but in 6th grade, on Easter weekend, a boy from my class, Tommy, killed himself with a shotgun in his parents bedroom while they were out at a family function. I have no idea if he was gay, or what, but I know that he was heavily bullied by some of the people in our class. 

I used to play basketball at a friend's house and he lived right across the street from Tommy. We'd tried to play with Tommy before but he seemed really shy/reserved and never came out to ride bikes or do anything with us. I do remember that we noticed him sitting in his mom's car in the driveway one day, backwards, just watching us play basketball. He ran inside when we noticed.

Today I'm still left wondering, ""why?"" His family was obviously devastated. His sister switched schools, but the family continued to live in the house. I vividly remember kids shouting ""SUICIDE!!"" at the top of their lungs when they would walk by his house on the way home from school. I don't really think there was any logic behind it, they just did it because they were being edgy in front of their friends and mob mentality absolutely brutalizes our better angels."

&gt; You don't understand how hard it is to get a keep a job and support myself as a woman.

Even if I concede that these situations might be harder for women, they are still very big concerns for us men to. Yes we do get attacked while walking alone sometimes and it's very scary. And yes getting and keeping a job there pays well enough to live off of is hard work for everyone."

I don't know the laws, specifically in LA, but I'd be surprised if they could evict you for having a certain schedule as long as you're doing due diligence to be quiet.  Can you park a street over maybe?  Sometimes being friends with the people you live 10 feet from is worth an extra 60 seconds of walking."
156,"I think you should talk to her as it's getting you down. Depending on where I'm going I dress up with or without my boyfriend. I don't think she's dressing provactively for guys, maybe she's like me and just enjoys dressing up. I don't do it to attract men, I like how I look and like to dress to flatter my figure. If guys try it on with me it's an easy no as I'm in relationship. Are you confident she's saying no? If not than definitely sit down and speak to her. 

Also, she may dress down with you a little more as she knows you don't like it when she's massively done up. So she tones it down around you so you don't have to worry about other guys when you're together. When's she's alone however she can handle herself and so wears what she wants. Does that make sense?"
157,"This may not count technically, but I was treated pretty poorly by a gay kid in high school. He was generally just an unpleasant person, very bitter and full of himself, he starts getting physical with me and we start fighting in the classroom. Eventually it's broken up and we agree to fight outside.

I didn't want to fight him, but I wasn't going to let him sit there and fuck with me. So w went out, there was a mall crowd. I waited for him to get to close, grabbed him and put him to the ground. Eventually he gave up and demanded another rematch and I told him where I would be. I think he was bluffing for the crowd because he never showed up.

Everyone sort of defaulted me as being the bully, even though I'd never started anything with him, never wanted to confront him, and never made fun of him."

If a woman walks by you and you just touch her ass and she didn't say you could, that's sexual assault.

I think most people here will tell you to leave the country for sure. 
That being said, a woman who supports her partner is a priceless thing. My wife has goals and dreams but her main focus is being with me and raising our beautiful children. We'll have time down the road for her to discover her dreams and take them to the next step. Maybe it will be the same for your partner. If she's already moving away from Islam, then chance are she'll become more acquainted with the idea of leaving with you. You have to decide how bad you want her to be with you. Marriage (for me) is a side by side thing. I put my relationship above everything else in my life. I have a different pov of success though. 
Bottom line: be patient with her and invest in her. It takes time. Don't let her stand in the way of what is important though. You can't make a heart love someone. You can't make her want to leave. Be true to her and if the feeling is strong enough, I believe she'll follow you. Then you keep her and love her and give her all you can. Good luck buddy:)"

182,"Son here, when I was about 8 I started watching the new series South Park on SBS (Australia) that all my friends were talking about...my dad was looking after me while mum had a night out (separated parents) so I asked if we could watch it. My dad being a venezuelan immigrant and not really watching tv much had no idea what it was so he said sure. It was the episode with the gay dog. We started watching it and slowly my dad starts piecing together the dialogue and visual cues before it dawns on him that this is not prepubescent viewing material. He calculates the value of me learning tolerance toward LGBT and other fringe individuals before making a decision. He leans over and addresses me.

 ""Iamamotorbike, does your mother know you watch this?""

 ""No daddy."" I replied, as the references continued to flow completely over my underdeveloped brain.

 ""Okay...good...let's keep it that way. You're only to watch this with me okay? Never by yourself. And don't tell mummy okay? Promise?""

 ""Okay daddy, I promise""

 ""Good.""

It seems like when I date around and reveal bits and pieces of myself, it seems like it's really hard to discern between who is interested in me as a person, and who just wants my stuff.

**Do** help him into conversations with women. Getting into a conversation with random women can be *hard*. Many women are, for good reasons, generally suspicious. As a woman you have a natural advantage. Just make it look natural.  
**Do** remember that the main purpose of a wingman, or wingwoman, is to distract the target lady's friends. Essentially you are helping pair off against another pair. This means you are probably gonna have to take a hit for the team and talk to someone really boring.

IMO, it really depends on how they approach it. There's a fine line between goodwill and being a pushover.

-----

*Original comment:*

My current girlfriend, a Japanese girl (I live in Okinawa), made a big impression recently:    
    
(sorry for any errors - sent from my phone)    
 I thought it was just a normal weekend date. Went to a movie, then a slightly nicer than usual restaurant, and then made our way to our usual Japanese-but-American-friendly bar for what I thought was going to be just the start of a typical night out - until I walked in.     
    
From the door I noticed that it seemed a little busier than usual. Momentarily worried about not finding a place to sit, I realized that I knew most everyone there. No - wait. I knew everyone there. Ok, cool. I don't mind it being packed if it's friends. I don't mind standing anywa- what's that new banner hanging from the ceiling? Cue the semi-sychronised shouts  of ""Happy birthday!"" and realization sinking in. 

Surprise 1: I'd forgotten it was my birthday.    
Surprise 2: I'd only mentioned my birthday on our second or third date, about six months prior.    
Surprise 3: I had no idea I had enough friends to fill a bar.     
    
There's more surprises, but I'm getting tired of the list format. She also made three cakes. One was actually meatloaf with mashed potato ""icing"" (I had mentioned months prior that I like meatloaf when discussing cultural foods and whatnot), the second was an amazing chocolate/strawberry layered cake, and the third was a very simple, light cake for a non-consumption purpose. At this particular bar, there's a tradition of getting cake in your face on your birthday while everyone joins in singing the birthday song on karaoke. So that happened, and it was hilarious. In my gleeful disbelief at how the evening had unfolded it actually caught me by surprise, too. I felt silly for forgetting about that, but it was all in good fun - and I got her to pose for a couple cute pictures of us kissing while I still had cake on half my face.     
    
And then when I thought all the surprises were over, she busted out a gift that still makes me blink away man tears when I think about it. She presented me with what I thought was a slightly oversized birthday card. It was a little thick for a card, which made me think it was a big pop-up card, or maybe had one of those music playing things inside. Turns out it wasn't a card, but a book. Simple, plain white binding (probably intended for some craft or scrapbook purpose) and 5 pages (10, if you count front and back). Inside, she'd had all my friends sign it. -No, that's misleading. Inside, she'd gotten all my friends to write notes, draw pictures, and wish me the best. In all, nearly thirty people had written/drawn something. Maybe I'm not as much of a SAP as I thought, but I had no idea how solid most of those friendships were. Several of the individual notes were a punch in the man-tear ducts, and the overall effect very nearly had me choking up altogether. (I was getting free drinks, so if I'd started bawling I'd have blamed the alcohol)     
    
The real kicker is that she'd spent a little more than a month orchestrating everything and used her free time to meet up with most of them so that they could have time to think of something to write to make it more meaningful.     
    
I've never been with anyone else who would put so much effort into making me feel special, let alone who understood me well enough to pull it off.     
    
**TL;DR: Girlfriend showed me how much she cares by showing me how much all my friends care.**

230,"So is it fair to say that having certain looks and a certain amount of money makes a woman worthy of commitment, to you?"
231,"My dating experience is radically different from what is often described here, because 1) not American and 2) not bitter.

The biggest difference to what I often read here is probably that 

- chance plays a *much* bigger role, 

- crazy laundry lists of ""must haves"" and ""no gos"" don't matter once you find someone who just tickles your fancy for reasons you can't well explain yourself, or that if you stubbornly cling to your lists they just make it impossible to find someone, 

- finances / career / etc only matter as much as portrayed here to an abysmally small, not very desirable population of people when it comes to dating,

- 99,99% of men are a lot less ""creepy"" and 99,99% of women are a lot less monstrous than those who are bitter like to pretend,

- and that for me as well as anyone I know in real life who isn't emotionally stunted, *genuine feeling* played a much more prominent role than usually presented here."
232,"Are you surprised? if an attractive male with copious funds approached you, would you say no?"
233,"I'm not really sure how to explain it. I've always been very social. For me, talking to a girl is no different than talking to a guy, at least until I'm interested enough to make a move. I've always had female friends, ever since I was a little kid. All through school my friend group was a pretty even mix of guys and girls. I just feel comfortable talking to people. It's not like there's a special technique or something like that. "

Having said that,  I'm a conventionally attractive guy who has managed to accidentally *become* the creep at least once,  so I realize that a lot of the time it's more a breakdown in communication than anything else. Unless  it's blatant disregard of her wishes... i.e. stalking,  continued requests for sex after an initial ""no"", etc... I assume that it's misconstrued. 

Having said **that**, I learned in the military that perception counts more than intent. It doesn't matter if you *meant* to disrespect that officer, if he *perceives* disrespect,  you disrespected him. Similarly,  it doesn't matter if you *meant* to be creepy, if she's creeped out, it was creepy

I called his ass out on it, saved them tens of thousands of dollars. So they held an intervention for me to resolve our differences.

Kids are mean and if they're gonna make fun of someone they'll pick whatever outgroup they're a part of and bully them for associating themselves with that outgroup.

263,"I once outdid myself at a Mexican restaurant here in town that my wife and I frequent. I ate the whole burrito, and that, children, is the reason for the following tale of misery.
I like spicy food. Moderately spicy, anyway - I'm not one of those asbestos -mouthed lunatics that guzzles ghost pepper extract or something. I like stuff that's probably spicier than most people like it, but it's still within sight of sane food. 

Anyway... I ordered a burrito for dinner that I hadn't had before. It sounded good, had a little pepper next to it on the menu saying it was hot, and the waiter did ask how hot I wanted it. I, in my naiveté, said hot. What the hell, you only live once, and everything else I'd had there was disappointing in its mildness.
The first sign of danger was when it arrived. Peppers in slices, with the seeds, all the way down the top like lily pads. A sauce with visible flakes of something dried that I'm reasonably sure was weapon-grade capsaicin. I, not willing to admit my folly, ate it. By the time I was done, I couldn't feel my face, I was sweating profusely, and my wife asked if I was sure I was okay numerous times.

Through the course of the evening, I could feel that burrito moving its way through my intestinal tract. I'm pretty sure I'd have heard it humming the shark theme from Jaws had I had a stethoscope. Eventually, antacids consumed and prayers muttered for mercy from the Almighty, I retired to bed.

At maybe 3AM, I awoke with a sense of imminent peril. The burrito had reached the final stretch and was on its way to the exit, and my ass was telling me in no uncertain terms that no delay would be considered. I made it to the toilet just in time, lights still off, and sat awaiting my fate.

There's a timeless moment when you're just about to drop a deuce , where you exhale, your anus unclenches, and you await things, maybe giving it a bit of a push. That moment lasted both a nanosecond and an eternity, and then i, quite literally, yelled in alarm as Satan began to claw his way out of my ass.

At first, it was mostly solid, I think perhaps because my disbelieving intestines couldn't hurry the slurry of napalm along fast enough, so it'd developed a head of sorts. That, after an agonizing push that I swear felt like trying to birth a slowly exploding nuclear warhead, went to a more staccato bombardment of the toilet bowl. Liquid lava, propelled by pressurized gas, spluttered out of my ass, burning the entire way and leaving my anus a charred ring not even Johnny Cash could have turned into a song.

It went on and on. The plug at the front had mostly prevented any gas from preceeding the rest, so I was left gasping (for air, and with the effort - the stench was ungodly and I'm pretty sure my wife later burned the towels that were in the bathroom), unable to do anything but hang on for dear life, knowing that I was going to die here, shitting my brains out. Finally, it subsided. My ass cheeks were covered in little bits of poo water, and I didn't even care. My loving wife asked through the door, awakened by my sobs of pain, ""Hey, are you okay in there? Turn the fan on!"" I couldn't move. At long last, I resolved to clean up myself and my mess. Wiping the years from my eyes, I applied the toilet paper to myself, and discovered yet another horror.

Bill Cosby, in his pre-rape days, had a comedy bit about the writing paper that kindergarteners use, with chunks of real wood still visible. The TP, I'm convinced, was from the same manufacturer, only they included steel wool and shark scales pointed the wrong way in the recipe. I cleaned myself with the sandpaper, trying not to whimper too loudly and gently patted my poor tortured asshole dry. I was in pain for days afterwards, and I'm pretty sure I had chemical burns. It was the worst shit ever, 0/10 with rice or without.

I've heard a lot of women complain that men don't have to deal with make up, heels or being too fat/not pretty enough etc., especially in the dating world but I can honestly say that very rarely do I feel desirable to women. I spent many years not liking the person I saw in the mirror and worrying about whether I was ripped enough or tall enough for women to find me attractive.

296,"&gt;insecure and selfish

I also desire a ffm threesome, but would probably barf and lose all attraction for my partner if I watched her get penetrated by another man. It's absolutely insecurity for me, I have an inferiority complex and the fear of a partner cheating has always made me uncomfortable to the point of illness. 

But why then is a ffm threesome okay to me? Partially because of lingering casual sexism (women are not a romantic threat) and also because the way I picture a ffm threesome... We're basically doubleteaming my gf. I'd be fine with nothing more than touching and maybe kissing the other woman, as long as my gf could have a more exciting and pleasurable experience.

So very little of it is selfishness, for me, but I'm not the other poster's partner. Just wanted to shed a light on some deeper thinking of the subject since you seemed particularly harsh on it."
297,"This idea gets talked about a lot around here, but I actually (at least partially) reject it.

I think it might generally hold true for male-male venting, as we are less prone to discussing our feelings with one another.

However, when it's a male-female relationship I think this breaks down. In my own relationship there have been many arguments and fights that have happened because *I* was the one venting and did not want to necessarily resolve it. And I have seen it in other cases with friends and just overhearing conversations on the street.

I think men like to hold on to this idea that we are pure pragmatism and logic, which leads us to this conclusion that we only complain to find a solution to a problem. I think if we examine ourselves more closely, we might see that we do indeed vent even when the solution is clear, or just non-existant. Maybe we lack the self-awareness to notice, or maybe we tend to only vent to our partners and people close enough to us, who know that we just want someone to listen."
298,"I have posted my story on askreddit before but here goes: I actually turned down sex from a good friend of mine (18 or 19 at the time, 9/10 looks, 15/10 personality) because she was a virgin and wanted one of my best friends. It would have been just sex to me but it would have been something she would remember for the rest of her life and she was too good of a person for me to use like that. I wound up getting them together and they are now married with three kids."
299,"I refer to this as being ""on"". I have to throw a mental switch to be ""on"" for the duration of the meeting/date/party/event.

I'm not sure I can articulate it in a useful way but I just make a concerted effort to be extroverted. I normally prefer to remain quiet and keep to myself. But, when in a social setting, I have to force myself to be very forward, to introduce myself, to speak up, make jokes, offer compliments, ask questions. There's a measure of reckless abandon involved. You have to set the awkwardness aside and not give a shit if you embarrass yourself. You just surrender to it and wade in.

So, your best tool in carrying conversations and engaging people is asking questions. There are many, many topics that are commonalities and probably safe topics. Everyone has a past, a childhood, family, loves music, enjoys food, have either traveled or want to travel, has a job, etc.  And, generally, people like an opportunity to talk about themselves or share their thoughts. Ask the other person questions and they do all the talking. The art and skill in this is listening to their answers, validating their response, and asking more questions. Essentially, you're demonstrating interest in them. Everyone likes to feel as though they're interesting.

Also, if you're not good at small talk, then make it big talk. Small talk is difficult because it is small. There isn't much to say about it. So, take something more complex. I mean, you can't just walk up to strangers and ask them for their treatise on the nature of the human condition. But, once you have begun a conversation with someone, it's ok to table thought provoking topics. When a conversation lulls, clever segues are nice but it's ok to make abrupt subject changes, too. 

With all of that said, it's ok if a conversation doesn't flow. That, too, tells you something. If you can't engage another person, then they are either not interested or may not be a good match. That's useful information, too."

Teenagers often get really good at hiding our feelings. Particularly among higher-achieving teens, it can be a really difficult thing to get help with mental disorders. For me personally, I was convinced my freshman year of high school that if I was diagnosed with a mental disorder, I wouldn't be allowed to keep my honors classes and extra curricular activities, so I hid it from everyone. It's also possible for higher achieving teens to plan out a successful future for themselves, even though they don't think they'll reach it.

In other words, high achieving teens often have different rationals than their peers. Your son sounds like he was probably a perfectionist, and managed to hide it.
It sounds like his idea of perfect extended beyond classwork, beyond college admissions and a summer job, and beyond looking perfect. It probably including acting perfect, which to him, probably meant nice and happy. A perfect person wouldn't show symptoms of perfectionism. While I don't know your son, video games may have been somewhat of a chance to let down the act a bit.

Please don't blame yourself, he probably did his best not to let anyone figure it out, and from your post, it sounds like you weren't the only one who never knew.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground and married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

344,"That he is - as he's gotten older and the responsibilities have sort of ""sloughed off"", it's actually been really interesting for me and my sister to see all the things he takes an interest in and wants to do because we never knew about any of that stuff growing up. Every day, some bit of his past life comes up and it's fascinating, the stuff he had to do - even mundane shit like placing an international call during a time when there were no telephones publicly available becomes a small adventure.

Of course, he's also equal parts nuttier than a Snickers bar. For example, he once got one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Elucto-Electric-Mosquito-Batteries-Included/dp/B01F3N8A4Q/ref=zg_bs_3738021_4) and then proceeded to do two things - zap various objects (including himself, twice - because once couldn't rule out static, apparently) to see what happens and barging into every room of the flat, wildly flailing the thing around cackling with glee when he got a few mosquitoes. He'd then bust out a magnifying glass to inspect if they left any ""charred bits"" behind. As a result of this, [when I sent him this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJLgKkmllA) (warning, gross) he was beyond thrilled. 

Some real talk - one of my deeply selfish motivations for wanting children is partly because I want my progeny to experience the person that is my dad. In my eyes, if I could live up to being, like a tenth of the awesome that he is, then I think I'd have done pretty well. 

I envy my older sister because my nieces have a solid memory of their ""amacha"" (Maternal grandfather), but mine might not. My cousin brother doesn't know about my maternal grandfather because he passed away a few years before he was born and he was a gem of a man.

I was so excited about actually having picked a really thoughtful present for her well ahead of time that I showed it to my sons (7 and 9 at the time). They agreed it was a fantastic gift, and that Mum would love it. I swore them to secrecy.

First time they saw her, they said ""Hey, Mum, Dad got you the *best* gift for your crystal anniversary! You still like butterflies, don't you???""

Sigh.

* Just recently, I watched Pacific Rim for the first time. My wife declared it ""too violent"" for our kids (now 7 and 10), and forbade me from letting them see any of it.

I imagine you can guess where this is going.

However, the little....darlings....have absolutely no idea what ""Don't tell your mother"" means. As soon as she came in the door after I'd let them watch through the first couple of scenes, they went straight over and declared ""Dad let us watch Pacific Rim and told us not to tell you!""

* My wife and I had a joke some years back - she absolutely *despised* the ""Crazy Frog"" videos that starting showing up in the early noughts, and I'd tease her with it on and off.

Yesterday, my youngest was playing on a school-sanctioned website which had various videos to encourage children to dance and exercise and get active. He found one on that site that he particularly liked...based on the Crazy Frog. Wife was out at the time, so I told him ""Whatever you do, do NOT show that video to your mother.

I remember something about getting up for the bathroom and never making it back to the corner of the club said friends were in.  Of course, since I was just visiting this city drunk me couldn't even tell you what street his friends lived on anymore.  Well apparently, there was a very friendly couple of women who were willing to walk him ""home"" based on his description of the neighborhood and the house.  I don't think it was that far, couple blocks, but I just wonder how'd have gotten home without their help.  "

I've never used the app but I've known a fair number of women who thought of it as just that, a ""flirting app.""  Go on, match with a few hot guys and just let them flirt with you for a few days before moving on.

Some people, very rarely, are genetically immune to cavities and others are cursed with having really bad teeth they'll have trouble with no matter what, obviously good dental hygiene helps a lot, but it doesn't take much to have a problem.

Reason I mention this is my brother and dad are genetically immune and I have a friend who spends a lot of time on their teeth every day and I've noticed they go to greater lengths than anyone I know and they still have a lot of trouble."

442,"I agree, and if a guy were saying this, I think someone would have posted a link to /r/niceguys by now. And what does good-hearted even mean? In this context it sounds like, ""I am a very good, goodly good person who only cares for people selflessly and since I have sacrificed my wants and needs, someone should do the same for me.""  

Well, self-pity is unattractive in both sexes. We all make the most with what we've got, but it's up to you to maximize that. Plain girls, just like plain guys, can do that with fashion, grooming, and hobbies that you enjoy and make you interesting. Then add some confidence that should arise out of taking care of yourself and living your life for YOU, and that's it. 

Sorry about the buck teeth, big nose, lazy eye, or paraplegia. And 3/4 can be fixed with surgery. And even someone with paraplegia could get married. Maybe not to a supermodel, but hey, there's a sexual marketplace and no one wants to lose money.

443,"I don't think men giving women dating advice is horrible. It's usually stuff like ""be aggressive, be more confident, make the first move, be blunt"". That stuff won't work with every guy, but it will work with the vast majority of guys. 

Women's advice telling men to ""just wait for the right girl, or just be yourself"" doesn't work the vast majority of the time. "
444,"Ryan Reynolds is the prime example of ""Adequately Handsome"" in that he's a good looking fella, but if he was more beautiful, a significant minority would start to find him sort of off-putting for being *too* pretty in an uncanny way."
445,"I dated a girl with severe clinical depression. She took anti-depressants previously and hated how they made her feel, so she wasn't on anything to combat it. 

The only tip I have is to just listen and be there for her when you can. You're not going to fix anything, so there's nothing tangible you can really do, but just being there for her seemed to always help. Being there to let her talk or cry or whatever she needs doesn't seem like much, but for a lot of people it helps them deal with their depression to have someone they trust to open up to about it. 

Another thing I would say is to take time to take care of yourself too. If you're focusing all of your time and energy to be there for her then you're not going to do what you need to stay healthy as well. I spent do much time dealing with her that I looked up one day and realized that I was severely depressed too. It became a vicious cycle of dragging each other down. I ended up having to break things off because I couldn't handle it anymore, and it's the only thing I truly regret in my life. "

448,"Do you have those motion sensors as part of your burglar alarm? If so, one person stays inside while everyone else and any big pets leave the house. Then you turn on the alarm. The sensors usually only detect fast motion so slow motion is key here.

Starting from just inside the front door your aim is to get to the top of the house (or some appropriate location going past several sensors) without setting off the alarm. Whoever gets furthest through the house before setting off the alarm wins.

If that's too easy, leave a couple items at various points throughout the house that competitors have to collect in their journey back to the front door. Most items collected wins. If that doesn't sort it, whoever does it quicker wins."
449,"Upvote for content, not just for honesty.

I mean who HASN'T thought about having a whole armada of piss maids. "
450,"Back in college, I reached a point where I was frustrated with my inability to attract women. Eventually, I reached a breaking point where I realized I didn't know how to get anything I wanted out of life. I was making all my decisions based on what I thought would keep people from disliking me, but I wasn't actually doing anything that I wanted or liked.

So I decided to change that. It was awkward for a while since I had to figure out what exactly I wanted, how I could be happy with myself, and what would actually attract women. But it was worth it because after a few years, I ended up far happier, in a much better place in life, and far more successful with women.

My life looks a lot different than people probably thought it would when I was younger, but even when something goes wrong, I always have the assurance that I'm living life the way I want it."
451,The same one as for all sex: it's consensual sex between two adults. That's all that's required.
452,"Yeah, that was a blast. We forgot where we parked when we left and he just mumbled ""oh yeah, this is why I don't get high with my son and his friends"""
453,"A device like the MS Band, or a Fitbit wake you up with a vibration in the morning. I use mine every day and it's so much nicer to wake up to than having an alarm blaring at you. My wife likes it a lot more too since it doesn't needlessly wake her up when she doesn't have to get up yet."

455,"Gotta say I'd feel sorry for any *married* man who still kept sexual fantasies from his wife, unless those fantasies are illegal and/or involve his own children.

458,"I think it's more the assumption that a man should find it easy to go get laid *and have an orgasm*. Whereas women are notoriously harder to please, less likely to get any huge satisfaction from a random encounter, and are therefore 'justified' in using sex toys in a way men aren't."
459,"I totally creeped out some girl, stalked her relentlessly for weeks, sent her pictures of her dead cat, and now there's a restraining order against me. How do I get her back?"
460,"I think it was a classic case of compensation. I didn't want people to think I was gay. At that age (like 10) I didn't even really grasp what it was to be gay beyond being a pussy and it being sort of vaguely bad. No real line between it and discrimination. I wish I could take it back and give the kid a hug. 

Karma is a funny bitch though, made me realize I was bi by the time I got through my first year of highschool. "

Her: I feel really bad for you.  Statistically, brown guys have a hard time dating online. 

Me: ... Ok? 

Her : Cause women see you all as rapists.


Sadly, I actually let that get to me, and was kinda upset about it for a long time...didn't help I'd been going through a bit of lousy string of bad dates... Completely gave up on dating for a while. "

468,"I have found that my father ""regresses"" as well.

He was a school administrator, then businessman for 40 years. Now in his 60s, he is retired, and my parents purchased a new property to retire to. Lots of land, a big house, on Lake Cumberland in Kentucky. My dad will often go down there by himself or with his guy friends while my mom stays at their old house since she still has a 'retirement job'.

I decided to join my dad for a guys weekend. Keep in mind, this is a well spoken guy with a Phd, and wore a suit every day. When I arrive, he is mowing with a Farmall tractor that was probably built when FDR was in office. He is wearing a straw hat, no shirt, and some shorts form the 80s. A boom box has been strapped to the gas tank, and Conway Twitty is playing at full volume, competing for noise with the tractor.


He had gone full hillbilly. But he was (still is) having fun."

473,"Drinking for sure.

I mean, I do it alone. I don't even socialize. I just numb myself."
474,"It's not shallow. You have no right to be cruel to someone who is obese -- they still deserve respect and love. But you don't owe anyone a relationship, or even attraction.

Obesity affects so much of a person's life. If they are going to be part of your life, then obesity affects your life. It affects what you can and cannot do. 

And -- you simply have the right to your preferences. If you are not attracted to an obese person -- end of story, you have that right."

Got totally catfished which sucks because I liked talking to her prior to meeting.

Most of her profile pics that had her full body in them were from a long time ago when she was average size. I'm talking 10 years ago. Went home and thought my life over lol."
