0,"To be honest, it's very unapproachable in terms of dating. I will be as friendly to you as anyone else, however I will never consider asking you out because I view it as a waste of time due to cultural incompatibility"
1,"I immediately assume:

- Religiously Muslim.

- Possibly not interested in dating at all (conservative Islam doesn't seem to encourage traditional dating?).

- Likely only interested in other Muslims.

- Likely very conservative and with a conservative Muslim family that is likely to cause... friction with a non-Muslim partner.

Every Muslim girl I've ever known either did not date (publicly) or only partnered with Muslim men. The one story I have heard (edit: from the guy's perspective) had a huge amount of problems with a conservative family, that didn't take too kindly to an infidel messing with their daughter (while their sons were known for sleeping around with no real hesitation...)

Edit: Not saying that it's going to be impossible to find someone who's not a Muslim if you want to keep the hijab, but very likely you would have to take the initiative and take it openly."
2,Hang around some 15-year-olds and I guarantee you won't feel like you're 15 anymore.
3,"She glorifies shit like going into meetings hung over and getting away with it. 

Tweets about how proud she is at being a terrible bitch. 

Throws shade at random guys that 'wronged' her at what seems almost everyday.

Retweets some female empowerment stuff that is eyerollingly cringey.


Fuckboy and deadass are some of her favorite words apparently."
4,"I would approach you the same way I would approach a nun. Respectful, kind, but in no way would I hit on a woman in religious garb. "
5,"Your friends are almost certainly not going to be straight with you about why you're single, especially if those friends are women. 

Maybe you're so beautiful that men feel like they can't approach you: rare, but possible. Maybe you've got the ol' RBF, Resting Bitch Face. Maybe you aren't as good a communicator as you think. Maybe you have standards that are too high or you just have a poorly developed sense of what you find attractive in a guy, something that afflicts more women than the White Knights here will admit openly. Maybe you're boring. Maybe you're stupid. Maybe you're 30 and single and still expecting men to put you on a pedestal, which 30-somethings are far less likely to do.

Maybe you're just unlucky."
6,"""I saw the red flags, and yet I persisted. ""

Don't be that guy."
7,"I clicked on this thread planning to tell you to just go on the date without expectations, but I was wrong. Get the fuck outta there."
8,"Eh, growing up is overrated. If you're finding that your actions or behaviours are causing detriment to your life (immaturity, taking no responsibility, fucking over yourself and/or others), then absolutely address those. But never lose your inner child, there's a lot of beauty in preserving it and tbh many aspects of being a grown-up suck really hard."
9,"I did. My ex-girlfriend was a goodlooking, accomplished woman, but our relationship just wasnt exciting enough. I wanted to go on vacations with her, I wanted to try foreign food with her, I wanted to *live* life with her, but she was hella boring. I was blinded by her outer appearance.

I met my current girlfriend at a fashion show and we immediately clicked. I finally *felt* something. I felt alive and happy. Before anything happened between the two of us, I broke up with my ex and told her that it just wasnt working out for me anymore.

When she found out that my new girlfriend was black, she bombarded me with messages à la ""You left me for a fucking monkey?"" and shit like that.

She had never uttered a racist thing while we were together, but apparently me breaking up with her made her show her true colors."
10,"It really depends on how you feel about this girl, which you haven't told us. If you think there could be a future with her, you need to talk to her about trust and boundaries.

If you're just having fun, break up with her. The whole point of a casual relationship is so you don't have to deal with stuff like this. "
11,GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE NOW!!!!!
12,"Felt totally in love with her, dated for nearly 2 years, she left for 6 months to study abroad and wanted to ""open"" the relationship. I reluctantly said yes, figuring it would happen anyways with or without my consent, and thought that if she can't go 6 months with out fucking someone else I should probably use this time to look for someone new. Found someone new and and started casually seeing her during the ""open"" relationship, eventually cutting things of with the girl abroad who I guess didn't consider this as a possibility when she proposed an open relationship. I could not be happier now, I love the girl I met during that time far more than I could ever have imagined loving the girl who I was initially with, though at the time it seemed nothing could ever overcome my feelings for the first girl. Now I can't believe I allowed myself to ever be in such a relationship, so yes, the grass is far, far greener. "
13,"When he tells you something, you take it to your grave. Nothing breaks trust faster than teachers magically knowing things after you share them with a parent or overhearing your mom's friends chit-chatting about things you consider personal.  "
14,"I'm a guy who lived with 3 female roommates for a summer.  We never talked about modesty, and we all just wore a towel around our bits when leaving the bathroom after a shower.  It just was unspoken courtesy.  We walked around in our underwear which nobody seemed to mind.


We were rarely sober and a very merry bunch, so it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere."
15,[deleted]
16,"Sounds like something /r/relationshipadvice would say.

""I saw a red flag, so I quit.""

Don't be that guy, either.

Plenty of people are insecure and do somewhat stupid things because of it, but if that behavior is the only red flag OP sees then that's not nearly enough reason to end an otherwise good relationship.

Instead he should be a fucking adult and communicate, tell her that he may have seen her looking into his things and that he want to talk to her about it.  Ask her why she did it, tell her how it makes him feel, and work with her to find a way to continue to have a healthy relationship - and if she's unwilling or does it again, then that might be the time to consider ending the relationship."
17,Define obnoxious.
18,"If you really want to feel mature, start wearing your cellphone on a clip on the outside of your belt."
19,"Poorly, but I'm moving to the US very soon and apparently British accents are considered hot over there; so hopefully things will improve."
20,Because it's mysterious to imagine what's underneath 
21,"I was the one gal with three guy roommates... for 3 years. We were pretty lax on modesty, no bits showing, but it wasn't uncommon to see them in boxers or me in my underwear. 

Those were some of the best years of my life. Those guys are my brothers, we went through so much together...one lost his mom (a real gem of a woman), one went to war, and one told us he'd met the girl he was going to marry (he did, 10 years ago, we all stood for them), and my son's middle name is in their honor (they all had names starting with the same letter and same number of letters in their names, so my son followed suit). 

Thank you for the happy lil memory. I need to give them all a call."
22,"Home Depot has always impressed me by being able to portray both sexes as badass doers. It's really their entire marketing strategy, but they play both genders equally. 

I get the whole ""powerful"" mom/female tactic that some companies use, sometimes men look stupid by comparison, I get that. It's hard to build a narrative like this in 30 seconds or less without tilting the scales of intelligence a little to the extreme side, but there's a limit.

What annoys me, and I say this as someone who will completely forget about the commercial the moment it ends, is when the husband looks hopeless and like a full retard, like he's a danger to his children. In an age where the father/husband role is constantly being undermined through gatekeeping and such it bothers me when commercials portray the husband as having a negative influence in a family. "
23, Try to let me know that other guys are interested in them as a way to show value. I really don't care and it's more of a turn off. 
24,"I think it's fine, but strictly speaking from a ""relationships"" perspective, it would probably prevent me from thinking I ever had a shot/prevent me from thinking you're an option. 

Certainly wouldn't make me judge you or not want to be friends with you though. I think you'll probably have a fine social life. "
25,"Between the recent big breakup, the self-harm, and the new drinking habits, it's not clear to me that she's ready for dating. Also, you have to pay for everything and drive everywhere, and now she gets bored and bangs other dudes. 

I mean, I'm probably a lot older than you, but I would have zero patience for any of that. Do what you want, but I suspect you could do way better than what you've got here."
26,Nice try wife. 
27,"I lived with a woman in college for a while. We both were in long term, serious relationships and were absolutely not attracted to each other. It was pretty casual - we lived on opposite ends of the apartment and mostly stayed in our rooms, but walking to the bathroom in underwear wasn't unheard of and I saw her naked a few times. It just wasn't a big deal.

We didn't have any formal talk about it, mostly she spent enough time around me to feel comfortable and like I wasn't a threat."
28,"The key to ""not seeing every girl as a potential partner"" is knowing what YOU want.  Right now you have no standards.  Every girl fits the bill, because all you want is not to be alone.  People who struggle with self-esteem often have this problem, because deep down, they don't really believe they *deserve* to have any standards.  The truth is, not every girl will fit you, and a lot of them will make you miserable.  Stop thinking about getting a girl, and start thinking about what kind of girl will be right for you.  Trust me, it is much worse to have a girl that is wrong for you than to not have one at all."
29,Followed by the thought of 'oh god was I that bad?'
30,This covers everything I have to say except for the fact that I really love a girl with nice hair. Hair is a huge part of femininity and what makes me attracted to a girl. I need to see it.
31,Did you forget which sub you're in? Some of the people here literally can't figure out how to wipe their own ass.
32,Tell her that the reason you're not going on a date with her is that you found her twitter and tell her what you told us. Then tell us that reaction
33,Cancel it then. Why ask Reddit. You're like I don't like her....so then you know the answer. 
34,"I currently live with a girl, I'm 22 she's 23. Known each other around 2 years. She has a boyfriend who visits and stays a few nights and honestly? Nothing out of the ordinary. I just keep to myself and vice versa, no tension. We share the table for the occasional meal and were friendly enough so I can't complain...

Though I will say this. 

Bobby pins..."
35,"To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, hear the lamentations of their women."
36,"I really like her, but I've noticed red flags like this right from the get go. She gets very defensive over me. I'm not a big social media user yet has always seemed like she thinks I'm hiding something on there for some reason, because I have everything set to private.

It's not a casual relationship at this point. It started off that way but it's serious at this point. I'm still thinking it over and the more I think about it, the more it concerns me."
37,Bringing up other guys in attempt to make me jealous. All it does is turn me off.
38,abort. abort. abort. 
39,Guys who are exclusively nice to girls. It's actually pretty comical when a douche completely changes his behavior as soon as a girl walks in the room and completely worships and white knights for her lol. 
40,"WAIT. BACK UP. 


A poorly developed sense of what I find attractive in a guy. Damnit. 


Also, a lot of guys have mentioned they didn't know how to talk to me. I tend to go for the sensitive, chill types who'd never talk to me without first having mutual friends. 


Thanks for this answer. It's definitely a lot to consider a part from the boring and stupid part. "

42,"&gt; I can't completely take it off because I'm still partially dependent on my family

This would be the dealbreaker for me (at least as far as dating goes).  If your family are all up in your business to the degree that they exercise some control over what you wear, then they're certainly going to think they get to meddle in your relationships.  I just don't want any more crazy in-law drama than absolutely necessary, so I'm going to take a pass.  Nothing personal against you, I just don't need that in my life."
43,"An app that tracks happy hour prices, times and food specials for pubs in my city. Deciding where I'm going to drink is almost a full time job"
44,"Jerking it while a bidet sprays a gentle stream of water dead bullseye on your asshole. I'm not kidding, you've got to try it. "
45,"I don't think he meant it in a wholesome way.

I think he's saying that modern society has given women an immensely wide social and cultural latitude to stay single throughout their 20s and just ""enjoy life"". Which means casual dating, hooking up with whatever, and not really worrying about long-term relationship goals. Essentially just saying *eh, I'll figure it out later*. Which has always been amusing to me because we stress proper long-term planning in all other fields of our life. Imagine the following 3 scenarios:

- ""I'm going to just drift from job to job in my 20s and then worry about setting up the foundations for a sustainable career later. After all, now's the time to explore and have fun!""

- ""I'm going to just eat whatever and not waste time in the gym right now, and then when I'm 30 I'll get serious about working out and getting in shape. After all, 20s are about having fun and doing what feels right at the moment!""

- ""I'm going to just casually date a bunch of people, go partying, hook up with random dudes and not worry about developing long-term relationship skills. I'll figure that stuff out when I'm 30. After all, 20s are a time to discover yourself and have fun!""

If someone told you about the first two, you would probably shake them and say ""this is a terrible idea!"". But apparently society sees no problem with the third, especially when it comes to girls.

Anyway. So these women just have a good time and then hit 30 to realize *oh shit, I have 5 years left until I'm medically considered Advanced Maternal Age. Now what?"" Then the scramble begins, and with a sinking feeling these women realize that all the highest quality guys got taken early by smarter girls. So their only choice now is to settle with Mr Good Enough I Guess, and make the best. Have some kids. White picket fence house. Give your husband a strained smile in the mornings and sex once a week because that's what wives do, right? It's just all in all a terrible system, but one which our society has morphed into."

47,She is the worst story teller and doesn't know when to shut up. 
48,"Extremely. Calculated.  
Edit : why have I become the expert on touchy touchy feelies?"
49,"Not with your penis. 

"
50,"It's not really something any of us can tell you. We know nothing about you. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things it could be.

* Bad luck
* Lack of productive effort
* You smell bad / don't brush your teeth
* You're annoying
* You're physically unattractive
* Odin has put a curse on you"
51,"I don't have any advice to you, but you're a living meme."
52,"31 here, turning 32 in two months. I'm married, have a career, my degree, no kids though. Anyhow, still feel like I'm 21. "
53,"I absolutely regretted it almost immediately and if I could go back in time I would not have made the same choice.

TL;DR: Throughout High School I was massively obsessed with a girl. In college I met a girl who was better for me in every way and we started dating. The first girl got in contact with me and confessed that she's wanted to date me for the past year. I broke up with the second girl for the first. The first girl cheated and then broke up with me. "
54,"You need to set those boundaries mate, clearly and calmly. You also need to appreciate that with a near 10 year difference in age that there will possibly be a difference in security and maturity levels."
55,She gets pretty hangry. 
56,"I think a big part of it is the mystery, but also I think it excites us because it's they're sexualised items and when a woman wears them, a lot of the time it'll be because she has sex on her mind and wants you to have sex on yours (or more specifically, on the mind of the guys she'd actually have sex with - there's often collateral damage when in public.)

So it's both ""ooh I wonder what's underneath!"" and ""oooh this woman is thinking about sex and maybe I have a chance!"" Both are exciting. Of course that isn't always the case, but that's how I instinctively respond to seeing it regardless of how I choose act on that response. "
57,Be overly distant in fear that we will find them too interested as if this is a negative 
58,"For the record, I wasn't saying you are boring or stupid. I was saying that I don't know that you aren't, and those might be factors."
59,She's too pretty. Being around her always makes me want to get handsy &amp; inappropriate. 
60,"Eh, don't put too much stock in her racist things. We all say things we don't mean when we're upset and she probably thought it would get under your skin. 

(Not that it's acceptable behavior, just that maybe she's not a full-blown bigot unless you made her one lol)


Edit: I'm amazed at how many people have literally never said something they didn't mean in a moment of anger. I'm getting a serious ""the lady doth protest too much"" from a lot of people here claiming racism is black and white (ba-dum-tiss) where someone is 100% a bigot or not. But hey, if you need to tell yourself that you're 10000% not racist to sleep at night go ahead, just think of me next time you laugh at a racist joke. ;)"
61,"Happened to me a few years ago. We were both in separate relationships. We worked together so I spent the majority of my time in her company and I fell for her. I was unhappy in my relationship and I thought she was unhappy in hers too. 

Anyway, long story short, I ended up single, she didn't, we became good friends and spent time one on one getting closer. When she did become single I was so deep in the friend zone I wasn't even a consideration for anything more. I tried to keep my feeling platonic but struggled with it and became depressed when it was clear I was only ever going to be the friend. Not a romantic interest. 

She went through a rebound relationship and then directly in to the relationship she is in now, while I was used to provide emotional support in between times. I had to cut contact, told her I felt strongly for her and it was best for everyone that we didn't hangout anymore. I haven't spoken to her for a year now and I don't expect to ever again

I had been in and out of relationships throughout our friendship, but she was always a benchmark and no one has matched her personality, which was the most attractive part about her. I now know what I am looking for in a partner but I do still regret that I can't be in her life anymore, but friendship was never enough even though I tried to maintain a platonic level of interest. "
62,"To expand on this point, I'm not likely to approach a woman in a hijab with romantic intent since I'm an atheist, and I doubt a woman wearing it would be interested in something serious with a total nonbeliever."
63,"Well it was highschool, and I had been dating this chick for 6 months or so... Found out the girl who had previously been my first kiss a year beforehand still had a thing for me. It was one of those ""Durr too good for me"" kinda things and I felt intimidated a bit by her outgoingness.

So I broke up with the girl I was dating that day over the phone, then like a week later asked the other girl out. Now she tells me we've been married for 4 years or something and has pictures to prove it, but idk really.

Don't ever think about the other girl, but in a way I do regret just throwing her out like old trash, since we did spend quite a bit of time together. Last I heard she still to this day thinks my wife is a hussie for stealing me away... I don't think she knows what that word means"
64,"Hugs, high fives, shoulder taps when a joke is made, ""accidental"" hand touches. "
65,"ever had your ear canal cleaned by syringing? the basic concept is that a *qualified medical personnel* squirts a syringe of water like solution into your ear. the solution breaks down the grease/wax build up quite deep inside, and you tip your head to let it flow back out.

that feeling you get as it flows out is amazing, its like getting a blowjob for the first time but the tip is the inside of your ear.

do that whilst you spank the monkey and have a bidet squirt a stream of warm water on your anus at the same time. "
66,The one most interested in me
67,"Don't shame him. My mom, my sister, and Puerto Rican-American culture seems to love the idea of shaming as discipline. 

When he does something you think is wrong don't raise your voice and say ""you're just like your father"" explain to him calmly why the things he is doing are ""wrong"" or ""bad"".

Take an interest in his hobbies but take a more passive role. 

Ask him to make dinner with you. It's a fun thing to teach and useful. "
68,"Pretty modest. They'd walk around without a bra under their shirts on a Saturday morning, or come out the bathroom in a towel like anyone would, but nobody was walking around half naked or just in underwear. It was just like living with guys, just the bathroom sink and their rooms looked like a tornado went through the shit all the time."
69,"&gt;Maybe you're so beautiful that men feel like they can't approach you: rare, but possible. 

Sidenote; this usually encompasses both ""Intimidatingly beautiful"" and ""Hot enough that they think you'll be a stuck up bitch because of it."". "
70,"My wife went to a blowjob class, all women and used big pink penis dildos, she ran into a girl from high school there actually.

She went from ""pretty ok, I cum every time"" bjs to ""omg I can't stop thinking about her sucking my dick when she's not sucking my dick, cuz I cum with the force of 10,000 suns, holy fuck"" bjs."
71,"&gt; Fifteen, 25. What's the diff?

20 years in prison."
72,"what are we, 4chan?"
73,"This is the right answer. Listen to this one. And also, keep in mind that 25 is still a kid to anyone over the age of 35. Make the best of your youth. It will be gone before you know it."
74,"I left after 5.5 years. I didn't know until the last 3-6 months, but it was an emotional abuse situation. She was my first relationship and I thought things were always this way. It finally clicked my senior year of college when I got accepted into a grad program that wasn't in the same city as her current program. Her response was basically a ""I don't want you to take it. Turn it down."" type of deal. At the time I was good friends with my current SO and was secretly hoping we would end up at the same grad school (we met during undergrad research labs). I left my ex within 2 weeks. After my current SO started seeing each other and my ex finds out, she begins making accusations of cheating and starts rumors with our shared friend groups. Some believed her and I got more than a good share of threats, others didn't because they know me as a person and know I'm not about that shit.

It's a lot better. My current SO actually wants me to be happy on my own and not only be happy because she is there. So I do things that make me happy and we are happy together. We are about to finish our grad program and hopefully move to Seattle and get a dog. 

Also I lost 75ish lbs after breaking up with the ex. So good times. "
75,"Cancel, and tell her point blank why you are canceling.  At least somewhere down the road after her 5th husband, when her life is in the toilet, she might think back and wonder, ""what if that one asshole was right..."""
76,"I think it's got to be the Odin thing. 
"
77,"Here is what I did to this guy at work.  I'm not proud of it, but this guy was an real prize-winning asshole.  I needed closure on my seething resentment of this motherfucker.

I got some dogshit, and *wearing gloves* I shaped it into small balls.  Then I froze the dogshitballs.  Then I got some plastidip (you can dip your tool handles in it to get a rubberized coating) and dipped the shitballs in it and set them aside to dry.  Came back and added a little more with a brush to seal up the part they were lying on.  Trimmed them with a razor blade until they were perfectly round.  Now I have paintballs with shit instead of paint.  Refroze them for long term storage.

I made a blowgun that could collapse into three pieces.  I took it and one shitball to work.  Went into the bathroom that is near his office.  Assembled my blowgun.  Stood on the counter and lifted up the acoustic tile.  His office was on an outside wall (he HAD to have a window), so in the airspace above the ceiling I have a clear shot to that brick wall.  I blasted that shitball into the wall above his office.  For weeks, his office smelled just faintly of shit.  When it wore off, I got another ball out of the freezer and pasted the wall above his office.  I know he got facilities management to look into it, but nobody thought to look UP.  And it was pretty faint - faint enough to sometimes wonder if it was your imagination.

His office smelled vaguely shitty for a year.  People started commenting on it.  He came up with some excuse why offices needed to be rearranged (I think he wanted to palm off the shit-smelling office on someone else).  I heard about this, so I stopped giving his office the treatment.  Offices were switched around.  His new office wasn't near a bathroom but I used a nearby meeting room to line up a shot, and pasted his new space a few days after he moved in.

By the time I quit everybody thought this guy was incontinent or doing something really nasty in there."
78,Yeah I'm an arab dude (atheist) and i would date a hijabi if i knew she was nonreligious but it's usually impossible to tell unless they tell you directly. Sucks for all the women forced to wear a hijab by family or social pressure.  
79,"&gt;  they don't discriminate

so in a way cat callers are the most progressive of us all.

85,Blink twice if she is here.
86,"I did this with my current girlfriend through watching a scary movie. The tension, the suspense, the overall ""thrill"" aspect of it just kind of naturally drove us together while sitting on the couch. Before I knew it we were basically cuddling.

91,"""God this bitch is annoying""

We met in high school, and couldn't stand each other. As fate would have it, we got stuck together on a project and had to tolerate each other. Well we found some common ground and finally over the course of a year or so actually became good friends. By the end of senior year, we were dating. 

We broke up after I went off to college because distance got to us and then she left our hometown to move to the northeast. That was in 2009.

Last summer, she moved back down to this area and wanted to meet up with me as old friends. I took her up on it and well... Fast forward to this past saturday we finished moving into our new place"
92,"For several reasons my parents were worthless in terms of guiding me through my teen years. So I was determined to do a better job for my son. 

Around 7th grade (12-13yo) our son went from being a chatty, loving, completely open kid to a surly, withdrawn, silent presence in our house. We went from discussing anything and everything ... to discussing nothing. Puberty and adolescence had arrived. 

He was no longer communicating with me, but he couldn't stop me from communicating with him. I often drove him to music lessons, sports, friend's houses, school or errands. Rather than ride silently I started talking. 

I talked about things I like about his mother, about dealing with a difficult co-worker, about a smart but troubled girl I knew in school, about a gay friend who died of AIDS, about car maintenance, about why I liked fishing but gave up hunting, about who I voted for and why, about music I liked, about my father and mother ... you get the picture. I talked about anything that popped into my head, saving complicated subjects or long stories for longer drives. Mostly, he listened, though he sometimes asked a question or added a few words of his own. 

Did it help? Hard to say. His mother says he sometimes expresses attitudes exactly like mine. I know his sense of humor is a lot like mine. And a decade later he is once again the cheerful, open, loving guy he was as a child. 

Good luck!"

I've got this new job for about 3 months now, in charge of 15 people within a big energy company, pay went up, got my first car 2 months ago, still going to the gym regularly. Oh and I met a really nice girl a few weeks ago, so we'll see how that goes!

So yea, life is good! Cheers buddy!

97,"The portrayal of women as simpletons who needed their husbands to make their decisions for them, back in the Bad Old Days, was fucked up and I don't doubt for a second it helped brainwash generations of young girls to underestimate their own potential.  It was abominable and I'm grateful to the women's liberation movement for fighting it and making it stop, both for justice's sake and selfishly - because I don't like stupid dippy little women and what if my wife had watched bullshit like that all her life, and absorbed it until she thought she had to be a stupid dippy little woman instead of the badass powerhouse I know and love?  Fuck that shit.

Likewise, I really worry about my son seeing the equivalent leveled at men.  Any given instance is harmless, in fact some I begrudgingly find quite funny.  Deriding stupidity is the founding principle of comedy, after all.  But the horror is in *the repetition*, and the one-sidedness.  I don't want him to grow up thinking that it is normal or acceptable for him to be a hapless doofus begrudgingly tolerated by an eye-rolling, patronizing wife.  Fuck that shit, too."
98,"She was extremely passive aggressive and would say ""fine"" to your face and then talk shit behind your back.

Case in point.  During the early fall, spring and summer it was REALLY hot in our apartment and I tended to just wear boxers.  She came home one day when I was in my boxers ""whoops!  Sorry, let me go put something on.""  ""Ha, no it's okay.  I have a brother and dad after all, I'm totally okay with you being in your boxers. :)""  

So occasionally I would be shirtless or in my boxers, however in the spring when our flatmate relationship began to collapse I found out through a mutual friend that she had been whining and moaning about me since only a week or two after we moved in together!  Case in point ""he's **always** (not even 5% of the time...) walking around half naked!  OMG!  *Why* does he do that?""

She kind of turned me off from having roommates/flatmates ever again.

Edit:  words"
99,"She suddenly freaked out and said ""no no stop please"". She was having flashbacks to her previous sexual assault. I got from inside her, held her and kissed her, and told her that everything was going to be okay and she was safe. It was very surreal, but she later thanked me for how I reacted. "

102,"Lived with a girl I didn't know all that well for one semester.  She was dating one of our other housemates.  On one occasion (only one) I walked into the kitchen for breakfast and she was cooking in her underwear and a tshirt.  She acted like it was no big deal so I didn't.  

She was good-looking but did nothing much for me.  Plus one day I heard her in the bathroom and it sounded like a Harley, so that sorta killed it for me."

One thing you said is you usually go after chill, etc, etc. Pulling from my indirect experiences, is it possible that your ""type"" tends to be insecure? They may fake being secure because they've read women like secure guys. But after a couple months it starts to break them down and eventually they can't handle either your attractiveness mixed with you going out without them or your level of outgoing behavior and friendly behavior. Instead of mentioning it, they step back a couple of months in and try to fix themselves and find security. Sorry for any typos."
112,I love the order of your post. 
113,"I know you are being sarcastic, but the truth is it really doesn't shut up. You already know this because you asked the question in the first place.

It's an overt signal like any other overt signal. It's not that it is religious, it's that it represents something. If someone dresses like a chav then people are going to assume they are a chav and be put off. If they carry a pimp cane, then they are a pimp. If dressed like a bimbo valley girl then the assumption is that is what they are. If they have a large bone in their hair and carrying a club then are they signaling that they are a caveman. And yes, if you wear an overt symbol associated with a religion then there will be assumptions about your identity in relation to that.

Yup. And it is a signal of that identity to others. Can't have it both ways."

As others have said though, if you don't like her that much and it isn't serious, then it's time to cut it off."

As far as dating goes, it's a pretty big red flag either way and I doubt I'd ever ask someone out who wore one. I wouldn't consider it a problem in terms of friendship though. "

138,"Honestly, if a girl says she wants to open the relationship briefly, take a break, whatever, it's pretty safe to assume the relationship is over, which is probably what the guy was thinking. He probably had some time to get his feelings together before she left too. He may not have even been over it yet, but wanted to get back at her. I would have tried to do the exact same thing"
139,"some background on me because I am about to be really hurtful:
- I am a dude, 18yo
- from Iran, a country where Islam is forced on the vast majority of people
- agnostic atheist

ok now here are all the problems with you wearing hijab

- you're associating yourself with muslims and/or middle eastern people. This is to say you will be slightly avoided by all people outside of that group. 
- it makes you look less attractive because hair is a factor and you are hiding it. 
- it makes you look shy and introverted because that's the stereotype associated with a muslim girl. I would avoid you simply because I think you don't want to talk to anyone. 
- you are partially pretending to be muslim. Why on earth

but worst of all, I think you're doing it to not piss off your family. Because the only thing that's actually, objectively wrong with hijab is that women *have* to wear it. "

146,"If I'd seen the tumblr of the person I'm currently dating before I'd started dating her, I'd probably have run away, because it's a lot a lot of things that make me cringe.

It's not very representative of her personality in real life at all. 

I don't know if that'll be the case for who you're talking about or not, but I thought I'd make that point."
147,"&gt; He said ""You've tied my hands. If I tell you I forbid it, I'll still be worried if you're being true to your word. By expressing that this is what you want, there's nothing I can do to stop you"".

That's exactly how I felt when my girlfriend asked for an open relationship. I knew that no matter what I said, she'd sleep with the other man anyway, so I figured if I agreed, at least the lying and sneaking around would stop (it didn't.)

And like the OP in that link, when I actually *did* start seeing other women, she flipped her shit.

Another thing my story has in common with this one is that she wanted to make the rules. Since her side piece was a long distance relationship, she thought that mine should be as well. She felt that I was doing something wrong by seeing someone local. Of course, the fact that she was unemployed and thus had all the time in the world to go travel to see him, while I had a day job and didn't have that luxury had nothing to do with it."

* Men should pay
* Men should make the first move
* Men should show the ability to support the women (even if this isn't going to ever happen)
* Men can't be victims in a relationship
* Men should be ok with women regardless of her weight/age/insanity/marital status/number of kids/you name it (the expectation for a man to 'date down')
* Men should want to have sex at all times and with everyone
* Men shouldn't express negative emotions or feelings
* Men's dateability is seriously affected by his income
* Men are simultaneously expected to be 'gentlemanly' while also completely supporting a woman's agency 

And before the rash of downvotes start, no I don't personally believe I am victimized by any of that and for the most part I enjoy using most of the above to my advantage in dating, but the fact remains, it's out there."
161,"Ask him questions. The socratic method works amazingly well with my boys (11 and 8) - rather than telling them ""You hit him! That was bad!"", I'll ask them ""Do you understand why that was bad? How would you feel if he hit you?""

I particularly like to ask questions to get to the root of what caused the problem, and tackle that. 

""You hit him? Why?""  ""Because he was irritating me!""

""What was he doing that was irritating?"" ""Talking to me all the time!""

""Why do you think he was doing that?"" ""I don't know!""

162,"Not acceptable. You need to talk to her about this. Do it in a calm, collected manner. Eventhough she is in the wrong, going ""I know what you did!! Confess!! How could you???"" Will only make her shut down and get defensive.

Just tell her that you two need to talk and that you know that she was snooping through your stuff. Give her a chance to explain herself, but dont settle of dumb excuses. Theres no reason for her to go through your files or whatever on your computer without your permission.

And the thing about ""stalking"" is stupid too. Ive looked up SO many different people on facebook. It has nothing to do with stalking. If my gf has a friend that she talks about a lot, I'll look her up to see what she looks like. Nothing creepy about that. Its just curiosity."

177,"Long story...

 I'm a full time student at 35. (I also work full time and am a single custodial parent of 3). When I was a freshman (so 32) one of my classmates was asking another how to ask a certain girl to a fraternity party. The person being asked for advice responded with something along the lines of ""my girlfriend knows someone in her sorority. I'll have her see if she's interested.""

 I laughed out loud. They asked what was funny and I replied ""that's not how you get a date. Just ask the girl."" He (the guy asking for advice) responded with ""it doesn't work that way anymore. You can't just ask... then if she says no, everyone will make fun of you."" I said ""Bullshit. That's the best most effective way. Reach down, grab a pair, find the prettiest girl in the room, chat her up for a minute or two and ask her out. The worst thing that could happen is she could laugh at you. If that's the case, move on to the next girl... her loss.""

""That's just not how it's done anymore. It doesn't work."" I get up and walk over to a girl 10 years younger than me, way out of my league, and say hello. We talk for 2 minutes and it's about time for class. I look at her and say ""You should let me take you out for a drink... (I fully expected her to say no, or laugh, or act disgusted. I just wanted to show my buddy that rejection wasn't the end of the world.)"" She replies ""ok when and where?"" I tell her a date and time and she goes ""by the way, my name is xxx what's yours?"" In my full expectation of rejection I failed to give her my name, lol, or ask hers. She net me for that date though and my buddies finally started listening to me. Oh, and her and I had a good romantic relationship for over a year. 

Tldr: tried to show buddy that rejection was not the end of the world. Was not rejected. "

180,"Hooked up with a coworker while in college, she seemed pretty wild so I was excited.  She showed up at my house and reeked of cigarette smoke (blah), the sex was just not good at all, and afterwards she decided she'd stay after initially not planning to and proceeded to tell me how she was recently an orphan because her estranged dad had just passed away recently, this being a year or so after her mother passed away.  

I was laying there and listening calmly but inside my head I was fucking SCREAMING for a meteor to crash into my room and explode both of us into dust.  Fuck that sucked.  "
181,"I didn't bring it up, because I was brought up to appreciate when a woman puts my cock in her mouth.

She asked me though, is she the best I had had, and I answered, wincing, not really.  The thing is, my first girlfriend and I couldn't do PIV so all we ever did was oral, for two years, and we got a lot of practice in - that's a tough act to follow.  

She got a little bit miffed - that thing where they are peeved, but they know it's irrational, so they're kinda pissed at themselves for being passed, which just makes them more irritable.  But she got over it.

Then her competitive streak kicked in and she started reading tips online, not Cosmo bullshit but there was one site I think that was written by a former call girl... And she fucking brought it.  With a little feedback - which she made me feel very comfortable giving, by inviting it and never getting pissy when I gave it - she topped that hill.  She is the bestest at sucking off yours truly.  Blue ribbon stuff."

192,"First of all, you are allowed to approach guys as well - you don't have to wait for them. I am generalising, but a lot of the guys around your age that are comfortable with approaching girls are not really interested in relationships.

Personally, I believe the best approach is to not sleep with a guy until you've been on a few dates and are more aware of their intentions. A lot of the guys who only want sex are not gonna wait which is a good thing (for you). Some people may disagree with me but that's what I think!"

212,"You know back in the day I was bit more nervous on the touching aspect of dating. So how I would push through it would be with humor. If we were walking somewhere I would hold their hands and tell them I'm seeing if were compatible as a couple. 

Now a days, if it's a date I break the touch barrier as early and as often as I can. This also means that theirs been plenty of times were I've misread the whole situation and I can see that either they aren't looking at me in that way or they are slower to progress so If i don't see a positive reaction I ease back. 

I'm very open in terms of telling girls this is a date not a just friends going out for a movie. Usually if a girl is really feeling you then it's almost like she is finding ways to touch you also. 

Here are some ideas in terms of friendly touching situation. Tell them a story of some kind that has to do with touch. Something like, before I knew it felt this hand on my arm, then you grab her arm. With my last girlfriend I used my trusted palm reader move. I tell them I used to be a psychic and read their palms. All I do is look at their palm, find the biggest line and say that's their timeline, and then find the biggest line crossing that line and say that's the event where she meets me, then look at the same spot in my hand and say she's gonna break my heart. 

I know that one was probably too specific but I always like telling that story because it's how I ended up in a very beautiful two year relationship. 

Another one is instead of calling for her attention, use touch, I always gently lay my palm on their back. Usually by their shoulder and as the night progresses I'll get closer to her lower back. If it's going really good I'll squeeze a booty here and there. 

This post is cute though, it reminds me of those beautiful moments when your not sure and still nervous. They tend to stay in your head forever. Besides the palm stuff, when I took her in our first official date, she told me she was tired and her back hurt, so I gave her a massage. She said later that this was the first sign she got that I really wanted her and it also got her all hot.

222,"&gt; What do you think of the idea that people are treated better if they're better looking?

I think several studies have backed that up, such as attractive women getting paid more than fat women.  I reckon the same is probably true for guys, but is more pronounced for ladies.    

&gt; Do you treat women better if they're very attractive?

I'd like to think I don't, but I suspect that it is, on some level, subconscious.  Like I may give them more eye contact or offer more advice.  "

224,"*""The mark of a mature man is a certain scar he bears: the memory of a perfect woman never won, or of a once-true love forever lost.""*

We all have that one person who we dated or knew that nobody else will ever live up to. The danger is in falling in love with the memory of someone to a point that no real human with all of their perfections and imperfections is ever going to be able to live up to them. No one will ever be as good as our perfect dream, and that's a hard thing to give up.

&gt;But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure,

&gt;Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor,

&gt;Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.

&gt;Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.

&gt;Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;

Shes like really crying at this point so I ask her, what happened, did I do something? and in between her tears shes like no, its not you, its ok you didnt do anything. 

She finishes crying and then just falls asleep so Im like .....fuck I hope I didnt do anything to piss her off. We get up the next morning and Im like ....sooooo what happened last night? She was like sorry about that, the song that was on was the song me and my ex used to listen to and I when it came on, I started to think about him and the mix of those feelings and the orgasm was just too much. I was like uhh...ok but why were you crying when you were thinking about him? Then she drops the bomb and was like oh...yeah...he died last year while we were planning on getting married. 

She started tearing up again so I just hugged and kissed her and said it was ok. I probably shouldnt have asked in the first place but I thought I had done something to make her cry. That was a strange expierence....

Let's put aside the fact that as an adult, you should have a passport anyway as a second form of ID... She dismissed it by saying I should plan something first or it costs too much. Really quite ridiculous since every other weekend she was spending money shopping for cloths. You don't shop for cloths for one weekend and you have money for a passport... not a huge deal. I said I'd even buy it for her. Ultimately, I'd hoped to expand her world view but I was not the guy to do it.

294,"I had been dating a girl three years, it was my first serious relationship and went throughout college. Maybe a year and a half into it I meet this amazing, gorgeous girl in one of my classes and the connection was obvious. 

I figured it was just a crush that happens and ignored it. It was incredibly difficult, but it worked, and things went back to normal once I sort of stopped contact over the summer. 

However, six months later we ran back into each other and it was the exact same feelings. I ignored her overall for a year and a half and the feelings never went away. 

It made me realize my first relationship was pretty miserable. I couldn't be myself around my ex. She was very sweet and caring, but would always be nagging me for something, was high maintenance, and had a very bland personality based around getting married and had no real aspirations if you exclude shopping. I didn't have strong role models for relationships growing up and so I just sort of thought it was normal to not enjoy hanging out with your partner most the time. 

The breaking point was seeing the other girl hook up with some guy at a party. It was the most gut wrenching feeling and I knew that I was absolutely smitten. It was really really hard but I ended up breaking up with my ex because I realized we were only still together because we'd been dating for so long. Anyways, I talked to the girl about everything and told her I needed some time to recharge before I jumped into another relationship especially since I wanted to be fair to her and not just rebound. 

I took some time before we tried things out. I guess it's been two years now and she's the greatest person I've ever met. I'm exponentially happier than I was previously and mostly wish I'd recognized the signs earlier both so that we could've started dating sooner and so I could've gotten out of the first toxic relationship.  

Sorry if this was a bit of a rant and I hope this can help people. I think the most important thing is to realize you need to break up for reasons involving your current relationship. You'll always going to get crushes on people during relationships, it's natural. If you keep thinking about what if with them though you'll never be able to hold a happy relationship. "

I was extremely timid because I never got much attention from girls and she was so beautiful and radiated positivity and fun. We met at a group dinner and when she tried talking to me I just gave one word, short answers. She got my number afterward and started a one on one dialogue. 

Bonus: The way she tells it, she says that she thought I was incredibly cute and ""knew she was going to marry me the moment she saw me"" which was counterintuitive to every relationship she had previously. We have been married for a few years now and are very happy."

312,"After my divorce I had an open relationship with a girl for a year and a half. I always knew it wouldn't go anywhere. While we were friends and liked hanging out together there just wasn't a spark, for me at least. We hung out and had sex every now and then. The only reason it lasted as long as it did was because we had a lot of friends in common and would see each other whether or not we were together. It was.. convenient.

Recently I started going out with someone else. I'd known her for a few months, but only in passing. One night we were talking about exploring abandoned buildings. She was mentioned a house not far from where we were, and I jokingly asked if she was inviting me to check it out. She said yes. We spent the next 6 hours driving around checking out old buildings, graveyards, and the like, did some stargazing, etc. Eventually I worked up the nerve to kiss her. 

I decided that night I didn't want a bunch of open relationships any more. I only wanted her. Funny thing is, she was in a similar place. No attachments. It happened without us expecting it or looking for it. Now we're looking at a long distance thing while she is away for a few months, something neither of us thought we would do. We share interests, she has a great sense of humor, is adventurous (not the BS Tinder kind), and the sex is incredible.

Even if it doesn't turn out well, at least I know that I can have this with someone, that I can really love someone again."

They manipulate you.  

They never take any responsibility or criticism, talking with them only makes things worse.  

They drag you down with their problems but never acknowledge your own problems.  

They only come around when it benefits them, when you need them they are nowhere to be found.  

Edit - Since the post is getting traction I thought of a few more.  

When you do something for them they don't really appreciate it or they ask for more.  

They ask for advice but then ignore it and continue to complain about things.  

They hold things over your head to mess with you and create drama.  

They try to convince you that you are the problem.  

They lash out and try to hurt you if you do something they perceive as insulting.

**The ""Life Coach"" I had my freshman year of high school.**  In my freshman year of high school, I was diagnosed with ADHD and panic disorder - I went from straight A's to nearly flunking, and having daily panic attacks.  He helped me get on track to what I cared about, by being willing to listen, and by being willing both to challenge my ideas and have his challenged by me.  I never got back to straight A's - but I did get back to being happy, holding a job, passing school, and having about one panic attack a year, maybe less - all without medication.

**Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, co-authors of the book** ***Freakonomics.***  That book taught me how to truly think critically, how to avoid confirmation bias, and to always look for the source of and the causes behind information, even if it sounds correct or I agree with it.

**Two of my ex girlfriends.**  The one who never let me apologize and probably still hates me, and the one who hurt me, but then later was willing to sit down and talk it all out so that I could make peace with and get closure for the situation.  Learned two very different lessons - One, that just because you owe someone an apology doesn't mean they owe it to you to accept it, or even hear it, and two, that forgiveness and open discussion is infinitely healthier than holding a grudge.

**My best friend**, who grew up in an emotionally abusive family and yet is still the happiest, most ""normal"", and most functional human being I've ever met.  We remind each other to treat ourselves well, to talk about our issues, and to forgive ourselves, not just other people.

330,"Was dating this girl who had some very serious mental issues. Everyone tried to help her but she refused to get any professional help. I should have left her month before I did. I knew I didn't love her and there was this other girl who I was just head over heels for. I was scared, she had already tried to commit suicide once and I was confident if I left her, she would do it again. I couldn't live with myself if she did and it was my ""fault"". It took someone saying ""you've done everything you can for her, she has to want to help herself before anyone else can help her"" 

I left her for good the next day. Started dating the girl I was crazy about the day after that. She knew the whole situation, she understood (didn't like it, but understood my fears) and knew I had to do what I did. 

That was 5 years ago and I'm engaged to the girl I'm crazy about and getting married next May. "

343,"Wait, I have a bidet....how have I not tried this yet??"
344,"I'll be honest here. I will absolutely defend your right to wear it all the way, but it really upsets me when I see people wearing it. 

I grew up on a street in East London with a masjid at the end. East London has a sizeable muslim population, and pre 9/11, you never used to see hijabs or burkas that widespread. 

After 9/11 and Iraq, I've noticed a politicisation of the muslim community in the UK that I wasn't conscious of before. Women wearing hijabs and burkas are much, much more common to see now. I actually felt that attitude tighten towards outsiders in the muslim community that I had connections too after 9/11, when you'd expect it to be after Iraq etc (I digress).

Because I experienced the past and know it was never that prevalent, I don't subscribe to the view that this is an essential part of submitting to the Islamic faith, but feel it is closer aligned to the political aspirations of Islamism.

I also appreciate that a lot of women are forced into wearing it by their families, but also the opposite it true in a lot of cases too. It was once explained to me by a 'brother' who repeatedly tried to give me dawah, that in second generation muslim families there is an identity crisis and often the youngsters are more religious than their parents.

If anything parents are seen as capitalist sell outs, who yet enforce strict cultural controls on their children. Often religious groups are the only environments that children are allowed out the house for.

Anyway, whether by force or choice, when I see a hijab I sense agendas and trouble - whether it be directly or indirectly via family or community. 

I will never insult someone wearing one. I will never challenge them for wearing one. I will never physically or psychologically threaten or harm someone for wearing one. I will always step in a defend somebody if I see them being victimised for wearing one.

However, inside my heart breaks when I see somebody wearing a hijab. Not for the sake of the woman wearing one, but for society, as in my experience it represents a defiance to society, a subtle fuck you if you will.

I would also like to point out that in the UK at least, prior to the rise of Islamism as a mainstream socio-political ""thing"", society was going nuts because a sub-section of our working classes (Chavs), would wear hoodies as a uniform. This was seen as highly anti-social and a risk to public safety due to the drugs and gang connotations. 

With terrorism a major challenge in society nowadays, I think scepticism over hijabs is well grounded in the precedent set by the hoodie hate in the early naughties. 

I grew up playing football with the boys from the Masjid. I've seen the community grow cold and insular. I've had people give me dawah. I've read up on the culture and faith. As such I don't think my opinion is based on ignorance.

As you can see, your question has inspired a lot of thought here. I see this everyday, and its a conversation I have had to myself a several hundred times over... I can't interpret a hijab as anything other than a big fuck you to society, but if I am who I believe myself to be, I need to grit my teeth and accept your freedom to do so - or your families freedom to make you do so.

Still fucking hate it though."

352,"As an atheist from an extremely religious background, meeting someone who's had to deal with the same struggles as I have (losing your faith, dealing with exceptionally religious family, community exclusion) would be a huge plus. That kind of understanding means a lot to me because it was a big event in my life. The hijab negates all of that because my first reaction is, ""She's religious."" If I were to learn that you're no longer practicing, I'd still be skeptical because I'd assume you're still just sitting on the fence or your family completely rules your life. The first tells me that if our relationship ever became serious there's a high chance of religious arguments in the future, most likely around cultural values and how to raise any kids. The second tells me that I'd at the very least be butting heads with your family, and at worst be attacked at every opportunity as the bad guy making you stray from god.

TL;DR It doesn't make me think less of you, but it makes me think that we'd be incredibly incompatible for a variety of reasons."

Women talk about their high earning work and career like they think a man should talk to a woman about theirs, including earning potential. Lots of these women who are attractive enough already for most men think this attracts men outside of their looks. 

What they don't realize is guys DGAF. In fact the more a woman earns the smaller she makes her own dating pool since she most likely won't date down in income. Actually becomes a turnoff at a certain  threshold depending on your own income. 

Example: Female lawyers often marry other lawyers. You don't see them dating plumbers. Male lawyers date anyone from other lawyers to bartenders and hairdressers. 


Note: higher-earning women tend to do this. Dog walkers or daycare workers talk about their jobs too which is cool but they don't flaunt their income potential in conversation. In fact, I'd prefer the latter as a date instead of the above example (too concerned with money. YMMV)

Welcome to being a guy! It also kinda reinforces my point.

You're right that there are guys who will lose interest if you don't have sex early and some of them might also want a relationship. However, since you don't like sleeping with guys who are only interested in sex, waiting is the only way I see to avoid that for the most part.

Personally, one of the things I very much appreciated about my last girlfriend is that even though she's hot and very nice and could sleep with most guys if she wanted to, she didn't until she knew more about them. I wouldn't want to date a girl that sleeps on the first date with everyone even if she's the nicest girl (which I'm sure exist!). Again, you will certainly find guys who disagree with me but I'm just giving you my opinion :)"

I think we've all been on a first (or second) date that led to nothing, but thats just life. I always make sure to figure out what a date of mine *wants* in life and relationships. That way I can manage my expectations.

Its better than being led on and having people promise you love and loyalty and then they go and fuck around behind your back.

*You're going to meet a lot of women you could love.*   Even if you're already committed to one, you'll probably bump into another at some point in your life.

Whether to commit to one, and how you act when you find a second while committed to a first, are vital questions of character that will define big arcs of your life, and your self-respect.  

But if you're treating ""falling in love with another woman"" as a thing that can happen TO you, like some outside force, you might not handle this well.  Understand that it's a decision.  We (almost, I suppose) all meet multiple people we could love.  But we're each in control of what it means and how much of a mess it makes, for ourselves and for the people we value."

Despite this, we did keep seeing each other and it wasn't really much of a break at all, but we never officially ""got back together"".  

About two months into the break and a few weeks before we were supposed to end it, I went out and visited a friend of mine that I had always been interested in, but the stars never aligned.  She lived further away from me (about two hours) which made things tough when we were younger (I've known her since I was 12 or 13).  Anyway, I went to visit her sort of as friends sort of as hoping for more.  Visit went incredibly well (though her mother is not a fan of me, but I digress) and I decided to pursue her more fully instead.  

The trip was a couple of days long, and by the end of it we were committed to our relationship, so I texted my psuedo-girlfriend at the time (who I was on a break with) and told her it was over and never looked back.

460,Glad you're keeping your spirits up about it! Too many people get way too down in the dumps about dating. Being alone ain't so bad! 😃
461,"In high school, while volunteering for a hospital, I worked in a transitional care unit (the period between surgery and being let go). 

One day, there was a guy that was paralyzed from the neck down after he'd been in an accident (iirc a motorcycle accident). I asked if he needed anything and he asked me to help him blow his nose. I had to hold the tissue to his nose as he blew. 

It really made me think about the little things in life and to never take them for granted. I'll never forget that. "

468,"Here's three things that have NOTHING to do with love, because good relationships take more than just love:

&gt; **Communication**

This is kind of a given. If there's a problem in the relationship, you have to be willing to talk it out and get to a solution. It's about who's right, but what's right. Being stubborn and wanting to be the one who's right about an argument or situation does neither of you any good. You're supposed to be a team, a couple who's agreed to face life's challenges together; facing each other instead is just going to cause issues in the relationship.

This involves figuring out how you each best communicate and learning how to compromise how you talk. Maybe you're better at verbally articulating what you think, whereas your partner is better at writing out what they think. Maybe you can say your piece to them, and then they can take some time to write out a response. Or maybe your partner talks best when they're busy doing something else, like discussing an issue over a game of cards or something. Be willing to figure out how your partner talks (not just in words) and be willing to learn to understand them.

&gt; **Trust**

Of course, you have to be willing to trust your partner. This works both ways, as your partner has to give you reason to trust them while not giving you reason to distrust them. Trust isn't even just about the relationship in general, but about who they are. If they say they're gonna do something, they need to do it. If they say they believe in something, their behavior has to be consistent with that. The relationship only works when the two of you are able to work through your good and bad times, and you have to trust that your partner will handle their share of the workload as far as taking care of what needs to be done.

And most of all:

&gt; **Respect**

This is, to me, the *single* most important aspect needed to make any relationship work. It doesn't matter how much you and your partner love each other, if your partner doesn't respect you, they won't trust you, nor will they be willing to talk stuff out with you. Respect is something you earn, just like trust, but the ramifications of losing respect can be much more damaging. Respect comes from everything you do; how you act, how you treat yourself and others, how you handle your business in life. You want your partner to have an appreciation for your character that goes beyond romantic feelings; you want your partner to have a solid respect for the person you are and what you stand for.

This also means respecting your partner and who they are. Yes, you're a couple, and in many instances you should act and think like a team, but don't forget that you're two separate people. You each have your own likes and dislikes, along with your own individual personalities. They have their own life and interests and goals that have nothing to do with you, and that's what you want. You should admire and appreciate who they are, not want to change them or find ways to take advantage of them. Respect who they are and what they bring to the table, and you'll find that handling everything else will come much more naturally."
