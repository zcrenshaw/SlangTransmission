0,Get your most attractive female friend to weigh in 
1,kill myself what the fuck
2,I like to season mine with various herbs and slow cook it for a few ours. Meat falls right off the bone
3,"I forget where I heard this one, but would you rather: A. kill a baby with your bare hands, but everyone later thinks your tried to save him/her, OR 
B. Let that baby live, but everyone thinks you tried to kill it."
4,"Srsly it's just a baby, not like it's a dog or a cat or something "
5,"Woah we don't need to destroy the guy here, maybe second or even third most attractive."
6,I'll answer as a sister: let me fucking die. 
7,Fuck a pig live on national television or be responsible for the death of someone.
8,It's always just gonna taste like dick. Just try to keep it clean.
9," A budget.  I have kept 2 excel spreadsheets since I paid my first bill after high school.  One chart with all my bill expenditures and one with all my confirmation numbers (just in case a bill didn't go through).  After 2 months of bills I realized how much spending money I would have while still putting money in my savings account.  

Also, I stopped going to the bar (when I was 21+) and eating out is the the worst financial (and dietary) decision.  

If my grammar sucks, that's ok.  I keep budget gooder than most.  "
10,He obviously never had a chance to lose his pants. 
11,First option for sure 
12,Would you rather drink the ketchup precum or yellow mustard precum?
13,A short skirt and a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggggggggggg jacket.
14,"She asks me to open stuff for her and then squeezes my muscles.

Tells me how big my cock is when I'm inside of her.

Asks me to make sure all the doors are locked and everything is safe before we go to bed. 

Asks me to fix things for her and reach things and to pick out her outfits for her.

Rubs my back and makes me food after a long day of work. "
15,Getting to pound her from behind
16,"Would you rather have a molten-hot iron rod with barbs on it shoved up your dickhole until it cools and then suddenly pulled out while you bite your sisters nipple off, or be treated to a lovely dinner at your favorite restaurant?

Am I doing it right?"
17,"Just in case, all day - that's really optimistic."
18,"You mods go so silly around every minor and major holiday.

R U OK? "
19,Would you rather have to watch your parents have sex every night for the rest of your life?..or join in once?
20,"I, too, am alone and bitter."
21,"1. Must have life goals. Doesn't matter what they are (unless it's to get married and have her man take care of her) or how far along she is, she just has to be doing something.

2. Must be mon*o*gamous.

That's about it, really. "
22,"Grabs and squeezes my muscles. And I'm not sure if this counts, but when she falls asleep on the couch and I carry her to the bed while she stays asleep, that makes me feel like a protector/provider. "
23,"0, 1"
24,Does it make you feel bad about yourself? Do you find yourself lusting after a chain wallet of your own?
25,"Spore. It was marketed as having all sorts of variation and complexity, and it was a huge let down. It is definitely my biggest pre-order mistake."
26,One I haven't seen in other comments but is one of my dealbreakers is smoking. A girl who smokes gets auto removed by my brain.
27,"You have to keep it from getting sweaty. So I just give mine some air as often as I can throughout the day. Like if you have extra time on the bus or something, just plop it out. Most people seem to understand. "
28,Glasses.  Holy shit.  I dont know what it is but glasses can turn a 4 into a solid 7 for me.  
29,Not finding out what she does for a living. It was very awkward seeing her again at the clinic. 
30,"When I'm carrying something heavy, a man usually comes up and offers to help.  And since I'm lazy, I just let them. Plus, sometimes there's ice.  I don't want to fall. 


It literally does not matter what it is.  Flower. Box. Books.  Dead body.  A man always offers to step in and help.


Pretty convenient. "
31,"To crush my enemies and see them driven before me, and to hear the lamentations of their women. "
32,"A friend told me this one and it's pretty fucked up.

Would you rape your own mother/sister in order to save their life, without them knowing why you've done it?

Hey, you asked for it!

edit: thought the 'or' on this one was pretty obvious guys... The other option is you let them die for those who couldn't work it out"
33,"Hey, how do you spell your name? 

Rachel.

Okay, I wasnt sure cuz sometimes people spell their names super weird. 


---

Hey, how do you spell your name? 

Ashleigh

Oh that's pretty! Im glad I asked, cuz I spelled it wrong.  "
34,"Damn, I'm jealous. Everytime someone sees me carrying a dead body it's all ""ma'am please put your hands up"" and ""ma'am we're going to need you to answer a few questions for us"". Like.... I'm sorry, I'm not strong enough to do a 150lb overhead press, and I'm kind of winded from dragging this dead weight around so please just give me a moment. "
35,"Honestly, since this is askmen I wouldn't mind if there was just ""male"" and ""not-male"", makes sense to me, come at me. It's either the target demographic or it isn't. The difference between female and agender really shouldn't matter much on this sub.

What is ""bane"" anyway?"
36,"This is gonna be real fucking mushy, so buckle up.

I like that my wife enjoys being the 'girl' and having me be the 'boy' when we're being romantic and demonstrative.  She enjoys that I'm a little taller than her so she has to turn her face up and maybe go on tiptoe a bit to kiss me, and that she fits well into my shoulder or onto my arms, if she's being the little spoon on the couch/bed.  I enjoy that she likes being held.  

Mind you, we both reject the idea that gender norms are inherently important.  I'm bookish and quiet, don't watch or play competitive sports, and don't really care about being a man's man...and she's spent a few years on a road crew, and so knows more about cars than me and ogles heavy construction equipment when we pass a site.   That said, nothing makes me feel more like a husband, or simply more male, than holding my wife when she pops on tiptoes to kiss.  Feels good man.

Edit: thank you for the upvotes and kind words everyone!  And yes, I know we're disgustingly cute.  We like it, but we do try to keep it to ourselves unless we're alone.  So, of course, I had to tell a bunch of strangers on the internet."

43,"I don't know if you've ever had a hard cast on for a prolonged period of time for a broken bone.  After a certain point it becomes a test of your willpower to endure the itchiness and discomfort of the damned thing.

When it's taken off though?  You think itching the previously restrained appendage is nice? Try sticking it in a warm shower and THEN itching it.

Sweet merciful Jesus, I did this with a previously casted leg and had what I can only describe as a ""leg orgasm.""

It's disgusting, dead skin and hair just peel off everywhere but you can't stop because it feels like being massaged by angels."
44,"The new Star Wars Battlefront by EA. Grew up playin I and II and the new one had 0 campaign and very few maps. I've heard it was improved a bit through DLCs but I can't imagine it's anywhere near the originals 

Edit: wow this got lots of attention! Honestly if they just remade BF 2 and threw in a multiplayer I would have been more than satisfied"
45,"That moment when you catch her staring at you, and she looks away desperately fixing her eyes on something else trying to seem composed. Not really the catching her or that she stared, more that tiny loss off composure and not really knowing what to do about herself."
46,"Maybe try complimenting her outside the bedroom as well. For example, my boyfriend will always grab my ass or boobs (at appropriate times) or when I'm getting dressed he just watches me and will say things like ""I fucking love your ass"" or ""you have the most amazing body"" or ""you're so fucking hot"". It always makes me feel wanted and attractive. "

52,Tell her I'd call her. 
53,Grabs dads ass and runs.
54,"Sometimes it's bad sex. Sometimes it's something totally irrelevant to sex, like I find out she's a horrible person and I was overlooking her evil ways because of her nice tits and ass."
55,"A girl that has deep knowledge about stuff. It doesn't matter if It's a subject matter I'm passionate about myself, for some reason if a woman is explaining or debating something with me in a way that I've learned/changed my opinion about a subject matter, I just want to ravish her.

N.B: Was 'ravish' a good choice of word? It feels weird typing it vs saying it.   "
56,"Euthanasia.

60,"Be nicer to my High school girlfriend.  Not necessarily to keep her or avoid ending like we did, but just because she didn't deserve any of the times that I was a dick to her."
61,"She told me she can bring over another girl. If it had just been the girl who came, lets party. But she brought a guy, and I didn't want to be the weird one who didn't like it. So... surprise foursome.

She ended up marrying a friend of mine (I was 14, he was 17 and she was 50 at the time).   Haven't talked to her since..."
74,"As a brother, I agree with you. If I had to rape my sister so she can live, she'll kill herself with grief anyway."
75,"Yes! I went out on a couple dates with this really hot asian woman last year. She had everything. Great job, intelligence, and an amazing sense of humor. Not to mention, she worked out six days a week.

We were eating ice cream and she starts to tell me this story about how her and her friend saw some dude doing ""girl push-ups"" at the gym (i.e. push-ups on your knees, to reduce stress on your arms/back/chest). Then her and her friend began recording the person on Snapchat, added a demeaning comment to the Snap and shared it with their friends.

I got heated!

(1) You're only demeaning yourself by calling them girl push-ups. As if women, can't do the same push-ups as a male. I thought you were a feminist?
(2) How can you make fun of someone trying to improve themselves. Everyone needs to start somewhere. Did you stop to think that maybe he already did 1,000 normal push ups and now he's tired or perhaps he's coming off a shoulder injury.

Anyway, I told her later that night I didn't want to see her anymore. "

80,"After playing it extensively, I feel like it'll be controversial when I say Fallout 4. 

I made an exception to my rule about not pre-ordering, but honestly, I feel like the game hasn't lived up to the hype, as someone who loved playing through Fallout through my childhood. I still think that despite the undelivered promises (""New Vegas is gonna be so populated, you guise.....yuuuuge!"") the game as a whole felt...better, in ways that Fallout 4 kinda failed to live up to.

100,"When we get ready for bed she is almost always in bed before me. I would nonchalantly walk past her and yank her covers off when I walk around to my side of the bed. Soon enough, she would hold her covers tightly whenever I walked by. One time I lovingly bent down to talk to her and whispered in her ear ""You don't have a good grip."" By the time she could put her confused look on, I whipped back her covers. If you think this is a newlywed prank, this September is our 25th year married.

107,FYI this happens to women ALL the time. I used to get it at least once a week (for several years)
108,"I would not date you. I am being completely honest. Dating someone who is friends with an ex, especially if that ex is from  a LTR is bad business. Feelings don't really go away and I would be very conscious of him and my mind would be in overdrive if you two ever hung out.

Put a deposit on a large house and paid almost 70% of the mortgage already, taught my siblings how to drive and bought them cars and insurance too. My age now 28.

Alright i'll bite. 

Here's what you will need. 

1. Mach 3 Disposable  
2. Cremo Cream Shave Cream
3. Hot Shower
4. Cabrillis's famous Genital Balm ([Who told you to put the balm on?!?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAQCD2c1i4))

Get your shower good and hot. Shampoo your hair, then put in conditioner. Let the conditioner sit in your hair as you complete the rest of the steps. Now point the shower head at the wall or turn it off. Rub a generous amount of Shave cream all over your junk and in your ass crack. Shave your balls and around the base of your shaft to make it look bigger, but leave a pube fro above that imho. Alright now we get to the grundle. Do about a half-squat, spreading your legs to make a rhombus with your knees pointed outward. Shave up from your asshole towards your balls, rinsing the razor often to declog it of hair. Now push your butt out like you're an instagram model and while spreading your cheeks slightly, move (without shaving) the razor all the way into the crevice with it's tip touching your brown eye before engaging the hairs and shaving away from your large haldron collider. Rinse the razor and repeat until no hair is stuck to it. Now you have a lickable asshole you weirdo.



When you get out of the shower rub Cabrillis's Famous Genital Balm all over your johnson, balls, grundle, and black eyed susan to prevent itch and razor burn.

Cabrillis's Famous Genital Balm Recipe

1. 1/2 Cup Shea Butter
2. 3/4 Cup Coconut oil (virgin, just like your weirdly shaven man ass.)
3. 3-7 drops tea tree oil 

Heat up the coconut oil and Shea butter on a  radiator or SUPER LOW stove. Mix together and add tea tree oil. Cool to room temp.

Edits: Grammar...I don't talk so good

Also Edit: I am not a doctor, so idk if you will react to tea tree oil badly. Be careful around your bum ya bum."

141,"deleted facebook completely a couple weeks ago. i'll be honest, there are parts i miss. it's useful for groups, group chats and following certain brands and companies etc. 

however, it was a huge brain drain for me. social media in general is a popularity contest. people post stuff because they want attention, and they often get it. i also found it easy to get into stupid arguments over trivial things, and it just made me feel and look like an asshole. lastly, it was just making a recent breakup worse. i restrained myself from creeping her profile, but chat is the fucking worst. having her face in my sidebar constantly, with when she was last online, online etc etc was brutal. that was basically the nail in the coffin for me. it was a healthy reminder of those who actually care about me when i finally deleted it. i got texts from about a dozen people making sure things were ok and asking how things were going, those are real friends. 

lastly, i think people are fake as fuck online. some of the biggest assholes and shittiest people i know come across as mother teresa in their profiles. hell, i acted way differently online than i do in person. "

As far as going to school, you are already having doubts. How can you go back to school if you are under the impression that it's not going to help you in the first place?

154,"Yep, after peeing a few times and just generally being a dick inside your boxers all day, it's gonna smell/taste sub-optimal.

I found that drying it well after a shower, and then applying baby oil, helped some. The penis isn't really fond of being washed, rubbed and soaped like we do, it loses it's natural layer of oil and whatnot, and gets dried out and produces moisture itself, which makes it taste/smell a bit worse. The baby oil prevents that, it just smells like baby oil with a hint of dick after a long day. "

I like letting guys make the first move and pay for the first few dates (I usually start offering to pay after the second date, but guys I go out with usually won't let me, which I don't hate). I think the thing is, in this day and age, that none of these things are deal breakers. I'd be fine with being the breadwinner, I'd love to have a career, and occasionally I do make the first move because men can sometimes have trouble reading signals. But I'm just overall comfortable with traditional gender roles as long as they aren't forced on me. As long as I have a choice, I'm happy."

Just as a note, when you're with a woman and you really feel like you might be falling for her, and she might be falling for you, fucking go for it. I've been burned unbelievably badly in this occasion, when you love someone and they end up destroying you emotionally (temporarily), but give it a fucking shot. Society today is crumbling with the destruction of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles. Be a man and if you are into her, fucking act like it. Risk your pride if you think she is worth it. You can't make a relationship work if you don't give it everything. I live my relationships this way and I personally regret nothing about those relationships at all. I see so many people meander into 6 month relationships, break up, get into another one, breakup, go slay some pussy and waste a bunch of money for 3 months on people they feel no connection to, etc. etc. - But, that's the popular thing to do, the safe option, you don't have to risk humiliation, you don't have to push yourself, you don't have to open up to someone, you don't have to risk getting hurt.

Bearing yourself honestly to a woman you are genuinely attracted to and interested in is the way better option."

166,"Speaking as someone with heavy pothead friends, and as a woman who's dated serious pothead guys: Prepare for them to likely complain if you want to do an activity without her smoking weed.

I used to be a pretty avid smoker, gave it up many years ago because it was causing mad anxiety and didn't add much to my life. The people I know who are heavy marijuana smokers kind of come to rely on it, though. Oh a party at your parent's cottage where you request they not smoke in the house? What a drag! Oh a vacation where you couldn't bring weed with you across the border? Time to get sketchy and try to find a person to buy it from. Wanna have a board game night in? Gonna get baked for that.

It's sort of the same thing as someone who comes to rely on alcohol. At first it doesn't really bug you that your friend or romantic partner always seems to need a few beers to have a good time. But after a while it starts to get annoying that they can't go anywhere without drinking, and if you end up at a social gathering where they can't buy a beer they get cranky. Habitual substance use is kinda like that, whether it's weed or liquor.

In b4 ""I smoke weed and I'm not like that!"" Well good, obviously everyone is different and won't fit into this mould. I'm speaking about my personal experience only.

Edit: I've obviously rustled the feathers of some marijuana aficionados here. I suppose I expected that, but I'm not interested in debating. Do what you like, weed smokers! I don't care about what you do on your own time.  "

They're not all looking to lock you down as a husband

Much more carefree and fun. They're much more likely to be up for stuff and tend to say yes to doing things instead of no.

They have more realistic standards and expectations so they're much easier to make happy and enjoy being with. You're not subject to an audit of your income and assets and future profit guidance just to be with them.

The contrast in ages actually works quite well from a dating dynamic. They're at a life stage where they're still figuring things out but you've already been there and done that. So you can help them with advice and guidance and they really appreciate that.

Sex can be great as they like your experience and confidence. And libido's tend to be better matched.

You tend to have more income than them. Like it or not women generally prefer a guy with the money to spoil them a bit. That's hard to do with older women because they earn similar to you or they have been spoiled in the past so their expectations are much higher.

Girls often find older men attractive so they're actually more likely to be attracted to you than women your own age.

They're less tied down by obligations so you can be a lot more spontaneous with them.

Younger is physically more attractive

180,"I had my fair share of hookups off tinder. Typically the conversation started off with me making some stupid or cheesy comment that prompted a response from her. Something like, ""So does this mean that we're dating now? Should we tell your parents first, or mine?"" where she'll respond in a similar joking way. That got the conversation rolling so we could talk a little and feel each other out. 

Following that I always tried to get their phone number within the first day or two of talking. The line, ""I'm enjoying talking to you, but this app sucks for texting. Want to give me your number?"" worked 9 times out of 10. After we exchanged numbers and talked for a little bit via text I would set up a date, usually for the upcoming weekend. Typically it was drinks at a low key local bar. 

This progression worked out the best for me and I had a decent amount of hookups from it. Typically I'd try and keep the time between first contact and actual date minimal, three or four days at most. That kept us from dragging things out and getting bored.  Now, moving from first meeting to hookup is assuming you're a decent conversationalist in person and know how to seal the deal from there. 

Edit: Just to give you some frame of reference for me, I'm not a male model by any means. I think I'm a pretty average looking guy with a little extra weight from my years in powerlifting.

Anyway, these men who were raised by mothers and grandmothers shared a few traits: 

1. They tended to be self-aware and good at understanding and communicating their emotions. This is probably what drew me to them.

1. They had complicated relationships with their mothers. Often, there were boundary issues because, growing up, the mom had relied on them for more emotional support than is appropriate for a son. As a result, he would feel an undue obligation for her happiness. They all carried  lot of free-floating guilt that wasn't directly attached to anything. 

1. When they spoke about their dads, they simultaneously resented and idealized him. Like, the abandonment deeply hurt them, so on the one hand they hated him. But they didn't really know him, so they filled in the blanks in ways that eased the pain. Maybe he was an extraordinary man, just flawed and haunted. Maybe he was too complicated and tortured to be a dad - but still cool and interesting.




Anyway, here's the main lesson I learned from dating these dudes: Just because your boyfriend makes jokes about his mother, doesn't mean you are allowed to.

312,"You don't get to tell your partner what to do.  You can get to state your opinions and preferences, and then they get to make their own decision.  After the decision is made, you get to respond and decide if you want to continue the relationship.

In a healthy relationship, after you state your opinions and preferences, your partner calmly discusses their reasons and thought process behind their plans and you see if you can come up with a response that is pleasing to both of you.

Ex girlfriend was prone to severe attention seeking behaviour. She maintained friendships with one night stands. I didn't like it because it did not paint a picture of what a faithful committed relationship was like. She told me I was jealous and controlling. We broke up because she weaponized my feelings against me and tried to say the same to our social circle. All but two of the people in the social circle knew her to use sex as social currency. 

Current girlfriend was friends with some of her exes, doesn't actively seek attention from them. The biggest difference? The moment he showed disrespect for our relationship she told him to pound sand.

343,"I learned that I was afraid of my wife.

Married ten years, two kids, 8 and 5.

The couples counselor had thirty years experience and had seen it all. The counselor was questioning my wife, gently pushing back against some of her absolutist black-and-white statements. My wife became hostile towards the counselor. That lasted two sessions.

I found myself in fear in the face of my wife's attacks even though I wasn't in the crosshairs. That was a year ago. It's changed my life.*

After that session my wife called me and said she felt afraid that the couples counselor was trying to take our children away from her (to be clear: no child abuse, substance abuse, neglect etc. involved.)

Then she filed for divorce, lied about parenting and money in court and the judge figured it out. He didn't like that (she's an attorney.) I asked for 50:50. Judge agreed with me at temporary orders: 50:50 and asked her to move out of our house.

I offered three times to wrangle movers, deliver a truck with everything in it wherever she wanted. She kept saying no.
She arrived with a moving van and movers on our ten year wedding anniversary exactly ten years to the hour after we married. I just shrugged and helped the movers and carried cushions and minded the kids. Our cleaner said it was her ""anniversary gift"" to me. If the roles were reversed I guess I would have offered double or triple rates to not move on our anniversary.

She asked for 12 days out of 14 custody and started a investigation to try to strip me of custody. The complaint was that the kids teeth weren't always getting brushed, they didn't get a bath every night, the homework wasn't always done.
She named 12 people (teachers, friends, carers) for the investigator to talk to. 

Investigation came back with 50:50. Everyone my wife named said 50:50.

A nightmare divorce. We don't argue, don't shout, don't throw plates, never have. I've lived in fear of her and basically had never said no. I think about three years ago I started saying no. She has escalated the intimidation to try to reestablish the locus of control and I haven't blinked.

It was hard but I kind of just shrugged it off. Divorce was final two weeks ago.


\* I didn't sleep more than 3-4 hours a night for three or so months during the investigation. I slept all the nights with the kids when they were babies, worked part time, probably spent 70%-90% of the time with them until they got into school full time. Adjusting to 50:50 has been a bitter pill. Even contemplating less than that was terrifying and heartbreaking. 

Teachers say both kids are doing really well.

One year on I'm starting to see her through other people's eyes. Probably a bit crazy and not that scary once you call her on her lies.

I have to learn how to face her down. That eight year old will be calling her mom on her shit in a few years and I need to be there for her."

The thing is, it's not like people like me don't value our friends. When a friend asks me if I want to hang out, I say yes 90% of the time, and if a friend needs help I will 100% respond and help as best I can. If it works with one person initiating contact and the other responding, it's not a big deal.

378,"Men having father issues isn't at all uncommon. A growing number of grown men in this current era - and far more to come, at least from the most current generation - have grown up without a father, or even a step-father (and that's what most of the following is based on). From what I've learned, most boys and men with active fathers are rare to have these issues. I'm not a psychologist, but there are a few signs that come to mind:

• Much more unlikely to want kids, almost to the point of paranoia regarding safe sex.

• But if they do want kids, if you're a woman wanting children within a committed or even marital relationship, the man expresses constant concerns about being a bad father.

• Ineptness at what a solid majority of men and women would consider ""man skills"" - maintaining bicycles or automobiles or general household chores like fixing a leaking pipe or how to grill a steak properly. 

• Fear of women, or more specifically, commitment. Even if the mother was fantastic, this isn't uncommon. Some men (and women) growing up in a single-parent household may see relationships entirely differently regardless of education, and some may even assume that women are ""out to get them"". That is, of course, barring single-parent households where they were committed but the father died via accident, murder, or in war - or, worst-case scenario, suicide.

• Familial sentiment to the extreme - ""mother first, girlfriend/wife second"". This is largely a matter of how the mother is mentally, mind. I've met some guys that have mothers that are more than happy to have her kid out of the nest, another guy whom I had to convince his mom was driving a wedge between him and his girlfriend so she didn't ""lose"" him because she ""wasn't perfect enough for him"". I wasn't even the one in the relationship, but it still stressed me out just listening and trying to be the medium. 

That's all that comes to mind at the moment. I'm sure others have other things.

*This also applies to gay households (M/M or F/F is what has been studied most extensively); dual partnership almost always statistically results in more stable, happier children, adoptive or via surrogacy. "

387,"Adjust your attitude.

You need to stop acting like the victim in your own life when unfavorable things happen and just start formulating a plan how to deal with them and/or minimize their impact on your life. Everyone has to deal with struggles, but the people who play victim and push the blame (justified or otherwise) onto others ALWAYS stay at the bottom. 

Look up some of Mike Rowe's interviews on Youtube for inspiration. he talks a lot about jobs in the trades that no one wants to do, but pay extremely well.

You need to decide what you dislike more: putting in hard work on something you maybe aren't amazingly interested in but will open an avenue to get out of the rut you're currently in; Or just sitting and wallowing in your sorrows about how unfortunate your life is.

My brother's though tried ditching out on the $130 each for my dad's flowers, took like 3 months to get anything, so they can suck a bone if they're in a pinch.

412,what kinda sandwich we talking about here
413,"Oh gods, I did this twice.  Seems that my MO is to be friends first.  I knew this so when I was dating for the first time (MUCH later in life than is normal)

The first time was a co-worker whom I knew for over a year before anything happened.  She knew she liked me, so she wore a t-shirt with a joke on it she knew I'd like... and coincidentally enough she had computer issues that day and I was in tech support.  It worked...

But the REALLY interesting time... some 7 years later, I was single and had been dating for about 3 years.  I went on a date with this really interesting girl.  I wore a BaZnGa t-shirt on the advice of a good friend, and she wore a dress.  She definitely brought class to the date, and I brought safe familiarity.

It was a great evening, but not in the romantic sense.  We hit it off immediately, it was clear we were destined to be good friends.  Music, games, she was new to town and I had a gaming group and she wanted in!  I thought that this was the best date ever!

But... she had been kinda long-distance seeing a guy on/off and the night of the first date, they must have talked because he threw down the 'exclusive' gauntlet and she picked it up.

So they had an LDR relationship and I had thought that I was going to be single forever if I can't attract the girl when the date went THAT well.   /grumble.

So as chance would have it, she was broken down at the airport and didn't have anyone else to turn to.  She texted me and I came to her rescue... boosted her car, and we had a friendly lunch.  We started gaming, she joined the pen/paper group and we hung out a few times.  

Her BF came to town with his kids in tow for 3 weeks in the summer.  She was clearly having trouble with it... I wasn't telling her what to do, just was being a good friend, honestly.  I wasn't trying to weasel my way in, not one iota.  I've been in his situation before so I wasn't going to be THAT guy.

So he went back home with his kids, and she and I started hanging out 1:1 more often.  I was still keeping my distance but things were different.  We got more than tipsy a few times and I wasn't going to cross any lines... but it felt like she was interested so I told her that we were feeling like an eventuality, and she agreed. 

Then I said that I think she's leading the other guy on.

Oh, she was NOT prepared for that.  She knew that she was far too drunk to make any decisions so she basically called it a night, I crashed in the spare bedroom and went to work the next day.  She texted me that... she had broken it off with the other guy a few weeks ago, and that she was basically dating me behind MY back.

I love that!  She had the patience to let our friendship grow and... to some extent to test my resolve (I had admitted that I had affairs in the past, but I had been to counselling and shot/buried/pissed on that demon) so she definitely wanted to see if she could trust me.  Which she clearly could.

We went on our second date, with which I brought out my classy side which was a good match to hers, and we're now engaged :) "
414,This must be a regional thing.  Most of the women I've dated have insisted on paying at least their half of a date cost.  Maybe Vancouver just has some very independent women.
415,"I think the scope of the friendship is important to determine before drawing a line in the sand. 

A girl being close friends with an ex would be quite tough to deal with. If they hang out regularly, potentially alone, then yeah, I wouldn't be down, especially after a 6 year relationship.

But I'm still ""friends"" with most of exes, in that friends means we chat occasionally and pretty much never see them outside of a party we may end up at together.

I don't think being friends with an ex is a red flag. I think spending lots of time with them is though."
416,"1.  She must be able to gain my trust fully.  I cannot stand pathological liars, or really anyone who would intentionally break my trust with a big lie over something important.  I can't trust them, then there is no reason to get started at all.

2.  Must be smart/intelligent.  I've got to be able to hold a conversation with them, to respect their opinions, at times to seek guidance from what they think on a situation that would be facing both of us.  If I'm being honest, I really wouldn't be able to respect someone who isn't near the same intellect level.  I have tried it before, and it does not work.

3. Must have goals in life - work, personal, family, etc.  Must be willing to work together on shared goals.  Gotta know what thoughts are there for the future.  If someone doesn't have plans, then what's the point?

4.  Must be fiscally responsible.  I'm not a spring chicken anymore, and *IF* I subject myself to what is described as ""dating"" anymore...I'm not out to take on someone's massive debts.  I'm virtually debt free with a very healthy credit rating because I'm fiscally responsible, and so she must also have those same values.

5.  Mutual attraction.  This one is probably the most self explanatory.  I have to be attracted to her, and she to me.

6.  Drama must not be a driving factor in their life.  If they have a workplace that stirs it up and they love to get in the middle, or a family that does it, or friends, or...or...or  - then I just would rather avoid it.  I've got family members that have the non-stop drama overriding their lives, and when I'm subjected to being around them it is exhausting.  I would not want that in my life on a daily basis.

7.  They must have a level of independence in their lives, where I'm not needed to be by their side 100% of the time.  I would want them to have friends and go out to see them just as much as I would want to go see my friends.  I would hope they have hobbies, as I have mine.  It would be nice to meld the hobbies together, to get to a point where each other enjoys the others hobbies.  However, more the point is for each other to have some time to enjoy the things they enjoy, even if the other does not care for it.

8.  Near to my age/maturity level.  I'm not interested in someone 20 years younger than me (unless they are just looking to have some fun with no expectations of anything long term).  I would expect the age difference to be within ~10 years, but hopefully even less than that.

9.  ABSOLUTELY NON-NEGOTIABLE:  Smoking/drugs/alcoholic.  Not talking about those that may be in recovery for drugs or alcohol.  If they are into sobriety and have some time behind them, then that's not a deal breaker - active drug use, active abuse of alcohol is.  Smoking is a 100% no go.  And I would prefer it if they never smoked.  I have some very strong experiences in my life with people I love that have damaged/killed themselves via smoking, and I will not get involved with someone who is knowingly committing that slow, agonizing suicide.  I'm not putting forth the emotional investment, nor would I be looking forward to the enormous financial investment later on when their health fails them due to their bad habits.

10.  Beliefs must be compatible, or at least respect the other enough to let them worship/believe as they desire.  

-------

Yes it's a lot and yes it's pretty demanding, but I would also expect her to have the same sort of list for me.  Am I likely to find someone that fits this?  Who knows.  But I know what I'm looking for, and I will NOT settle for anything less.  It may cause me to be single for a long time - maybe the rest of my time, and that is something I'm willing to accept.  I desire a relationship, but not if it isn't the RIGHT one for me.

417,Having a booger you can feel in your nose while either giving a presentation or being in a meeting. 
418,Fractured my wrist in the summer several years ago and the feeling washing the dead skin off and getting rid of the smell felt orgasmic.
419,"Met a girl on tinder a while back trying to help out some mates with the group option thing, we hung out at her house a few times to get drunk and chiil.

 One night i was blasted out of my mind and she drags me to her room and starts kissing my neck and sliding her hands down my pants, so naturally we had incredibly average drunken sex, wake up the next morning and she had shit all over the place in her sleep... it was fucking everywhere. Best part is she wakes up and wants to go again without cleaning up or anything... suffice to say i dipped the fuck outta there real quick. Dont stick your dick in crazy"
420,"1. Use your words ""I fucking love your tits"" "" man your  ass looks great"" and don't just do it in the bedroom - touch her bum when she's cooking, tell her her ass looks great in those leggings you like, just generally speak your mind.
2. Don't worry about your dick so much, if it stops playing ball, move on to something else and fake it till you make it! Use your hands and find the g spot and fuck her that way, give her head, do any of the other things whose last name is sex ...
3. Tell her why you like her so she feels secure - a lot of our self esteem comes from feeling like we know what we're doing, so if we feel wanted, we think we look a little better."
421,But not both
422,ITT things everyone knows are attractive
423,"Wow, fuck everyone else here. You absolutely tell them. Put yourself in their shoes - you would want to be told.
"
424,"huh, never really had a problem with clingers. I always thought that women aren't comfortable with new people at their place on account of stalker fear. "
425,You forgot that all-important 'Serious' tag OP 👀
426,"Or, since you're omniscient, you would know that there is no way to retain the info."
427,"It's totally subjective from person to person and also depend on the situation but I'll give some:

- A hug when you're sad (it's nice to recieve it from a person you care about and being between his/her arms instead of being the one that always have to give them).

- Coming back home tired after work and your SO greets you with a hug/smile/kiss (any of those or all together).

Basically: Affection."
428,"The longest I've had was at a fairly nice hotel. 

60 inches long. "
429,"&gt; I borrowed 2k from assorted relatives/friends, and bought a house so I could stop renting.

uh huh

&gt; The house had been listed for two years at 41k, but they agreed on 37k.

wat

&gt; mortgage on my FHA loan lets me pay $347 dollars a month

As a guy living in a city where the average home price is [$1.28 million](http://www.citynews.ca/2016/06/03/average-house-price-in-toronto-continues-to-rise-to-1-28m-in-may/) this is surreal reading this. Where can I get houses for $30k!"
430,Personally I wouldn't date either.
431,Does it only have to be 30?
432,"It wasn't funny to begin with, and I only really see transphobes using the joke these days. It's shit."
433,"She said ""Sure"".

Of course I said ""Please"" and ""Thank You"" and I told her I loved her afterwards too. "
434,"*The Cutting Edge* or *Princess Bride* if you want an upbeat movie.

*Eternal Sunshine* if you want to experience the fridge logic horror when you realize what the final scene means, just as the credits start rolling."
435,Is this a joke? Younger women are more attractive.
436,"What if, in a twist of events, she likes it..?"
437,She does this gibberish type talking and I pretend to translate what she says.  
438,"Put water hydrants at every corner of the house.  This is easy to forget, but they're really convenient when needed.  

Plenty of electrical outlets.  If you do Christmas lights, under windows outside is a great place for them.

Have someone critique your floor plan.  Not me, but someone I know designed his own place, and I straight up told him during design that he didn't have enough room for his fridge.  He never changed the design, and when he moved in, he realized there wasn't enough room for the fridge.  Whoopsie.  "

440,"I work in legal, so I tend to be very careful with how I word things. I try to avoid statements of absolutes.

Conversely, I tend to pick apart the words of others and try to ""lawyer"" them in my mind. I generally will recognize what I'm doing and snap out of it, but it's just how I'm wired now."
441,"Wow, first date? That's shitty. But you handled that really well, bringing a female friend sounds like a smart way to deal with the situation."
442,It's more low body fat than muscle unless you have twig arms. Linebackers aren't exactly swimming in vagina 
443,good dividends!
444,Id probably pretend I was still asleep and just enjoy the moment. 
445,"I'd date a fiscal Republican who is socially liberal. That's just protecting your money. What I couldn't do is date a pro-life, pro-religion, anti-science Religious Righter. That becomes less about allocation of funds and more about being a fucking imbecile. "
446,"Command and Conquer 4.

Never forget."
447,This works both ways.   I've dated women who were otherwise terrible but had big tits and a nice face.   I think this just a part of dating.  Trial and error.
448,We've got to like similar music. I go to a lot of music and I need someone who I can thoroughly enjoy the same music with
449,"No, small children are terrible and you should want to murder them. That is a healthy sign."
450,"Men with distant/absent/abusive fathers, who end up trying to be the direct opposite of what they thought their fathers were (sometimes to their own detriment).

Men who grew up watching their henpecked dads get emasculated by domineering moms and end up having a fucked up view of how relationship dynamics work.

Men with successful fathers who spiral into self-destruction or self-sabotage because they feel they could never live up to their fathers' legacies."
451,I like not having to share my emotions and being stoic. I feel more comfortable that way.
