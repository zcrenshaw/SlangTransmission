2,"When they start being able to talk somewhat fluently like asking questions, making comments, etc. that's a good time to stop in my opinion. That's right around where kids start to comprehend and understand a whole lot more. I don't think it's weird at the age your daughter is at all, but some people disagree. It's your daughter and however you wanna raise her is how you should raise her. As long as it's not weird, your wife doesn't think it's weird, and the daughter is happy and healthy, do whatever. "

7,"Flirt from the start. This is what so many guys don't get. It isn't their fault, we are raised to not do that and grew up on media where that's not a ""good"" thing, but it's frankly more honest and productive. Otherwise you quickly stray into Nice Guy^TM territory "

14,"My wife has an incurable form of cancer, but she is being treated to extend her life. At some point the treatments will no longer have an effect and that will be all for her. It could be 20 years or it could happen this year.

One of the lovely side effects of the treatments is that she is in pain a lot of the time and skin is not only sensitive, but even raw in certain areas, if you catch my drift. So sexual relations have been a no go for some time now.

I must say, first off, that I love my wife deeply. However, knowing that her death is inevitable, I find myself checking out other women - some I know well, others are strangers - and fantasizing how it might play out if we were dating/married and, obviously, having sex. There is one in particular that I can't stop thinking about and it is seriously messing with my head. 

I have enormous guilt about it all and am concerned that, if a woman were to come onto me, I might have great difficulty saying no."
15,"yes I think the general agreed upon time is when they start pointing and saying stuff like ""what's that"" while you're showering. "
16,"You're a dick. I just yelled at my wife that I forgot to get my mom a Mother's Day gift. She suspected that I'm retarded, now , thanks to you it's been confirmed "

29,"I stopped when my daughter started wanting to shower on her own.

I think she was 3 or so.

We tend to be a pretty open family, and have never shied away from answering the basic anatomical questions.

My wife had to stop showering with our son quite early.  He got very interested in her boobs (they're spectacular!) very early on, and it made her uncomfortable.

Ultimately, it's your choice.  As long as you're both comfortable enjoy the bonding time.  "
30,"Pros: Your money and time are wholly your own. Growth is easier. You're not tied down and more mobile in your plans.

Cons: Less deep/intimate relationships. Greater proportional living costs/less expendable income (splitting groceries, rent, other costs with an SO saves much more than you'd expect). If you're prone to self-isolation (and don't enjoy that), can get dangerously lonely."
31,"Jesus fuck, kids these days.  If you're not an active drug addict or grieving the accidental skydiving death of your first true love or anything, you're ready for a relationship, if you meet the right person.

36,"Credit history? 

I'm assuming that the industry you work in has some form of ethical standards. How would your boss feel if you were researching your dates on the jerb?"
37,"Just because the attention from males is new for you to see doesn't mean that it is new for her to experience, and that might be something to remember. You see it as a big deal but she just sees it as boring everyday life, probably a mild annoyance. You already knew that she could cheat if she wanted to, and that's true whether she gets hit on constantly or not. She knows how to turn guys away and if someone wanted to stand out to her that would be a rare person indeed. If you aren't worried about her integrity then this is no threat to you at all."
38,"It's never too soon to teach your kids that nudity is dirty and their body is disgusting and shameful. All physical contact should be regarded as explicitly sexual, ESPECIALLY contact between a grown man and their own children. The sooner your daughter learns that you are a demented pedophile rapist, the better.

(or you could keep doing it as long it's a good thing. I showered with my daughter at swim club until she was about 4)."

41,"Hi there, 
I still bathe with my daughter she is 4 years old, however when she was about 2years maby 2.5 years old, I started wearing my swimmers in there with her. I still get all that great bonding and can keep doing this for a bit longer whilst she still enjoys having baths together,.

She seems to have a incredible memory, so i thought better she remembers dad being weird wearing shorts in the bath/shower rather than remember my wang.

My wife didn't think there was anything wrong with it, but i gotta choose &amp; set the standard."

47,"My SO gets pretty jealous, and gets angry whenever I get any sort of male attention. I never indulge in the attention, I just brush it off. One time, a male coworker got a little too close to me and my boyfriend got mad and said ""hey, whatever helps your fucked up self esteem right?"" 
He knows I have self esteem issues and he used it against me. That hurt a lot. "
48,"Crying ""I wish I'd never knew you"""
49,"Occasionally, I think about hate fucking some of my exes very roughly. Like, hardcore porn style hate fucking them and spitting in their mouth.

52,Not in Europe.  It's already happened.....I think.
53,You know damn well I dun run out of dick.
54,"I once got dumped because she wasn't feeling the chemistry. I was hideously inexperienced for my age at the time, so I didn't understand what she meant, especially since our conversational rapport was excellent.

It was the physical chemistry. I was a bad kisser, and didn't really know how to escalate the sexual intensity of a situation very much. She, more experienced, had become accustomed to not needing to say, ""I'd like more of this or less of that"" in direct terms. She might not have felt comfortable doing so at all.

So she broke up with me. But went out with me twice after. Then we faded because there was no way at the time I could handle her fuckin' other dudes and whining to me about it.

I eventually learned. Small bits of advice here and there, small bits of feedback from partners in requests every now and again; the biggest being to start slow then ramp up while reading how they respond and respond in kind from there. It's like a jam session together.

In general, I'm a quick study. Partners not long after her really let me know they appreciated my skills and struggle to imagine what a much clumsier, clueless version of me looks like. I used to wonder from time to time what it would be like if I had more experience before meeting her, but that's life."

56,Show me somethin ' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
57,My kids like Minecraft. 
58,"When she isn't present, approach your roommate about this. Ask them if they intend to make this constant/permanent. My rule of thumb has been two consistent weeks if it happens without communication between roommates, and a month if it happens with communication between roommates. These may be arbitrary lengths of time, but nobody should be staying in your home without your consent (rather, consent of all legal tenants). Is it okay with you if she were to officially move in? Why or why not? Talk about this sort of thing with your roommate to see what they're thinking. All in all, it's just a courtesy that you are owed and would owe them if the roles were reversed. 

I consider it a matter of protecting yourself from your landlord. Depending on your state/county/city codes, your landlord could decide to evict you two on the basis of the extra person, or assess whatever the deposit would be. Protect yourself. (Not a lawyer. Just some dude on the Internet.) 

Edit: Words"
59,"Generally speaking, men make the first move, women don't. "
60,"Okay, so here's the story:

We met when we were 18. I thought he was so cute and he thought I was... I dunno, adorable and easy to read (he'd had a hard time with mixed signals from ladies before). We started dating and we were together for about two years. 

Then he started kind of ghosting me (before there was really a word for it), and I had had enough so I finally got him to meet up with me for long enough for us to have a conversation. Which is when he said, ""I don't think I'll ever love you. At least, not the way you love me.""

It was really painful but it was also very honest. Which I respected. So we didn't talk for a total of 23 hours and then we started trying to repair our friendship. 

Skip forward two and a half years. Apparently, he's been regretting the decision for almost two whole years, but I'd been dating other people and so had he. We had stayed friends and we ended becoming really close and we spent a lot of time together just as a couple of buddies. Until one night.

It was about four in the morning and we were working on math homework, and he kind of blurts out that he has feelings for me and he understands if i don't reciprocate and he feels awful for what he said and blah blah blah. I had never really gotten over him because, for all our faults, we had been a great couple. And he was a great SO. So we decided to give it another go.

We got married yesterday. It all worked out. "
61,"Tidy the place, fresh bed sheets, baby wipes in the bathroom, cut and file your finger nails and get some snacks/drinks. 
Just relax and enjoy yourselves. "
62,"To /u/JustHalfBlack : I'm nobody and know nothing, but talking to her about it might make her feel even worse than she already feels. I think this is one of those times where if she doesen't bring it up, then maybe it's best to not ask.. 

I really don't know. If you're as young as you claim then you don't understand women yet, they motherfucking complex son. 



To OP: I don't know the right thing, but make sure that you will be able to live with yourself with whatever thing you chose to do.

 Best wishes to you and your wife, man, really. "
63,"Their nationality. I've heard so much ""oh I have that _______ attitude / personality / temper"" 

Newsflash : people of every race, creed, culture, religion, country of birth can be assholes. "
64,"Here's the thing, as part of my job I get background checks run on me on a pretty regular basis, it honestly doesn't phase me to have one run on me in a professional setting.

But this isn't a professional setting. It's honestly kinda creepy. More than that, it's a major red flag that you don't trust me from the outset.

Furthermore, using work resources to run background checks on people in your personal life violates a lot of professional and ethical standards."
65,"* Remember things she says, even the little ones. 
* Do her favors. 
* Give her compliments and remind her what makes you crazy about her.
* Surprise her with small gifts or a nice dinner after a tough day. 
* Listen to her even when she's ranting about stuff. Sometimes she just wants a listening ear rather than logical advice. 
* Flirt with her a lot. 
* Don't put your penis in other women. "
66,"Your breaking one of the big social rules:

1. Never compare yourself to other people, it can be incredibly self-destructive.

2. Do compare yourself to your best self, are you working towards improving yourself, were their great moments or lessons or experiences you want to re-experience.

3. Just let it go.

Here's the deep stuff.

If your self-image your perception of who you are, and what kind of person you are is dependent on how other people see you, then all you are is a reflection of other people's ideas and beliefs and theories.

Be your own self, experience lots of life, so you know what reflects things, ideas, beliefs that you value.

I used to obsess about this as well, being handicapped, and not losing my virginity till I was 32. It made me feel like I was less a man.

No what harmed me was not the lack of sex, it was my own deluded perception, that I was less of a man because of being a virgin.

Stop that crap. It is such a waste of a life, to focus always on what your not, or what others think you should be or do.

Be you, be your best self, that is a reflection of who you truly are."
67,"I can weigh in on the legality of this one.  Turns out you are never allowed to do the whole ""draw straws"" thing.  A court case came up (from England) where they used the defence of necessity for killing someone when they were stranded.  The court said the correct thing to do was to sacrifice yourself (they made a direct reference to Jesus) rather than choosing to kill someone else."
68,"""Fuck you!""

She's said ""Fuck this"" and ""Fuck that"" or ""Fuck off"" but she *never* said ""Fuck you"". We've had our share of married people arguments (going on 15 years) but nothing had ever reached the level hate to elicit those two words.

I can't even remember what the argument was about now. "

72,Bro how the fuck do you flirt
73,"My brother and I were raised by my mother. Although my father was involved, he lived elsewhere. I saw him every other weekend or so.

Being raised in the way that I was made my standards for a romantic partner quite a bit higher than most people's. My mother managed to raise my brother and i without being dependent on anyone, and she's a former gang banger, so she wasn't weepy and emotional.

I expect women to be emotionally resilient and independent...I cannot date someone needy or overly sensitive..it just comes off as childish, because my mom and grandma are some of the strongest people I know.

If my grandma could survive and leave an abusive marriage and raise my mom, who raised two men alone in abject poverty, I have zero emotional bandwidth for you crying because I left the toilet seat up or went somewhere without you."

79,"I am a university student who occasionally has girls over (not a lie I swear. But maybe a humble brag). I'll compile you a short list of things to do.

1. Clean the bathroom. This means no skid marks, clean sink, no piss residue on the floor, and most importantly a bag in the garbage. Trust me on that last one. Nothing say's ""This guys fucks"" like having a place for tampons to be cleanly put in.

1.   Clean your bedroom. When is the last time you cleaned your sheets and pillow case? I do it before if I know I'm going to have a woman over, and then probably after sometimes... Probably why my backne is flairing... Anyways not only is it good hygiene, it will remove the funky smell from your room. Also pick up any clothes on the floor and tidy up whatever shit you have in your room. I personally don't hide my amiibos, superscope, and retro game consoles. But you might want to if you are trying to hide your power level.

3.  Clean literally anywhere else she will be. I like to start things in the living room and then move things into the bedroom. Because of this I either have to clean all the shared living spaces or blame all the mess on my roommate. It is also a smart idea to hide any of your roommate's stuff that will make them look cooler than you.

4. Communicate with your roommate. If you haven't picked up on it I'm using roommate as synonymous with housemate. Anyways you will probably tell them to stay out of the living room, or to be out of the house if you know for a fact that they cannot socialize or are bigger than you. It's also probably smart to ask if they mind if you have a girl over for the night and then disregard their wishes if it's a no.

5.  You will need to plan activities. This is a way to show off your passions, do something casually to get them in the mood, or to get to know them better. It also shows that you care about spending non-sex time with her. You and her both know that's a lie but she will probably appreciate it. I personally like to pull out some retro games and dazzle women with Shaq-Fu, Micheal Jackson Moonwalker (I'm just bragging that I own this game. Don't play it with women), and or whatever side scroller beat-em up I want to play. The most important thing is that whatever you do you are low key competing but still forced to work together. Other ideas you can use are netflix, cook a meal together, show her you rock collection, or drink.

6. At this point you want to go back in time to at least six months ago and hit the gym. The gym will make you feel inadequate and make her orgasm the only thing your ego resides on, while simultaneously making you kind of more attractive. The lowered self esteem of surrounding yourself with guys bigger than you will also probably make you more eager to please her in bed. 

That's all I can think of now. Hopefully this helps. If you have any questions feel free to ask. This list is also by no ways exhaustive so if someone else can help out, that'd be cool."

90,"This is probably unexpected here but I think it's the most hurtful and shocking thing I've ever heard my SO say to me. We were in couples counseling on my recommendation. I'm a vet with ""issues"" (of course). It came out in our one and only session that she was afraid I would hurt her. I was a nurse that had to deal with the violence of war every day, to hurt her was unthinkable. But fueling the fire of her fear is that I've been practicing martial arts since I was 16. I've been known to destroy some inanimate objects before the war. I love her, we've been married a LONG time, but I don't think I will ever not remember her saying that. "

I resisted the urge to freak out and just asked him gently what he was doing. He said ""theyre soft and squishy and feel nice"" which, to be fair, is very true. I just had a conversation with him about how he hadn't done anything wrong, but he needed to understand that boobs are private and he can't go round touching all the boobs just because they feel nice. He seemed to get it pretty well."

107,"It really, really depends on your temperament and your specific SO. A great SO is like a cheat code making life better -- the good times more meaningful and the hard times more tolerable. A good SO is your teammate and works with you to build a great shared life. A good SO doesn't control you, because you two are compatible and agree on what should be going on. (In other words, any necessary compromises are typically small ones, not big ones, since you're compatible.) A good SO is an awesome communicator.

A good SO is your best friend. It's great. 

There are almost only pros when you're with someone like that.

But most people aren't in relationships like that. And being in a bad relationship makes literally every other thing in life far worse. It's better to be single than to be in a bad relationship. Or even a mediocre one. "

115,"I've been good at sex... only bc we could communicate. My last gf who I was seriously in love with I had the worst sex with. She didn't make a noise, wouldn't laugh, wouldn't talk or anything. Starfished. It sucked when it came to sex.

Edit: 

To finish my answer to OP. 

I was terrible at sex. I avoided women after some failures, drank a lot. Partied and made sex only when I was drunk and stumbled through the entire thing. It wasn't until one of those hookups turned into a girl who wanted to keep trying. It was marginal at best... but it showed me physically it had nothing to do with it.

I am ruthlessly dating. I stopped making amends with women that don't fit my mold. I LOVE a woman who I can communicate with. If she is one of these ""there is nothing funny about ____"" women, then I feel like I cannot communicate honestly. 

Physically, I have an typical above average dong... I mean it's no dad dick. So, this may have been my only saving grace when I was younger because everything I did to a girl was awkward and didn't make for good sex.

Along with communication, women want to be understood and have an intimate relationship and connection. Be open about your feelings and emotions and understand how a woman feels... then you can identify when she wants to be desired, or pursued or just straight up taken control of. Then it's usually less to do about penetration but about reading and feeling and treating her the way she wants to be treated, when she wants to feel that way. Communication is cool with a chick who knows what she wants, especially if you can be honest in the same way. Some chicks will be like ""I want to smother you with my pussy""... and you might be the guy to say ""I want to choke you with my cock""

Plus... sex is different than a relationship, it's a lot more raw, and that's why it's fun. So just have fun OP. Just read about that dude with a micropenis, he still has a decent... but strange sex life."

If she ask questions use real terms she can understand at her age. Let her know that boys and girls are different and that's ok but that we keep yourself covered around others. That no one should touch her. There's all sorts of good help. Even at a young age it's important to face the questions as they come. It helps keep children safe."

We moved to the carpet/bedroom/shower it was just a complete and utter sex marathon all over the house fucking like rabbits. At one point I lied on the kitchen floor and had her squirt into my mouth and i gulped it all up and swallowed it down. Looking back its kinda gross as those secretions are mostly urine. I wiped my couch down with my PJ bottoms and the next morning they reeked of pee. Looking back its a little grody but she was lovely, cool as shit, I loved her and it turned me on to an insane degree.

That's exactly it. MIL is a bit traditional in her thinking and tends to view nudity as sexual. She was offended by my breastfeeding our daughter as well.

 When our daughter is old enough to comprehend that daddy has a penis, mommy and daughter have vaginas, then, sure, it's time for solo showers. But right now it's a matter of convenience since she's a baby that can't bathe herself- since it's not sexual it doesn't matter which parent is bathing her. "

I'm only physically intimate with my girlfriend because 1) I love her. 2) When I entered a relationship with my girlfriend I became a part of a mutual contract which is I promise not to get physical or intimate with anyone else.

205,"Pros: The Emotional Fulfillment of being with someone you love.

Cons: Loss of free time, less time to see friends, have to monitor your relationships with female friends more closely, less money, always having to think of someone else, risk of emotional pain if you guys break up, risk of growing bored with the relationship, can't pursue other women, can't make future plans without considering the relationship, life stress brought on by the other person's problems.

In my opinion, the pro's are worth the cons with the right person. And ONLY with the right person. You know deep down if it's the right person just like you know your name.

The cons are NEVER worth it with someone who's ""good enough."" I don't fucking care how lonely I feel, if it's not the right girl, I'm not going to date her.

If I never meet the right girl, then I'll be single for life. Because none of that bullshit is worth being with someone who isn't absolutely right for me. 

Edit: Since this got some visibility, I have something to add:

Every human being, has dated a person whom they know deep down is the wrong person, but they are still deeply in love with them despite that fact. 

They can be the wrong person for the most seemingly-insignificant or incredibly significant reasons, it doesn't matter.

If you know they're the wrong person, nothing will change that. No matter how much you love them. I hope you can find the strength to leave once you realize they aren't right for you.

I held on to a woman I loved despite numerous red flags and the clear and ever-present reality that she was SO WRONG for me, staring me in the face. I held on and got burned, badly.

Luckily I have enough confidence in myself to know that I was the victim in the situation, and 6 months later I've moved on and am happy and healthy. It was a very difficult, but worth-while lesson. "

All that said, sex is all about calculated risks, and I'm not inherently against sex work or sex workers.

Right now she's just a baby and I don't think co-showering is something anyone should be questioning you over, though people probably will because they're gross.

I used to take baths with my younger brother and I can still remember the day my dad told us we had to start taking baths separately. I was so confused. He didn't explain that it was because we were different genders or were getting, in his opinion, too old, he explained nothing.

For your bedroom, change your sheets and pillow covers and keep everything neat, presentable and DEFINATELY NO RANDOM SHIT LYING ABOUT, everything needs a place, if it doesnt have a place, its going in the garage/attic/trash

Get some snacks and probably some booze, you probably wont need anything too fancy but nothing is more awkward than running out of decent food/booze because your roomy took it and you didnt know. Wine is pretty good as its classy and pretty light. Generally Id suggest a bottle of red and something to go with it at the minimum.

Make sure you have protection in an easily reachable place, nothing kills the mood harder than looking for your fucking condoms and having no idea where they are, also please make sure they arent 3 years old and full of holes, just go buy a new pack and be sure.

Tell anyone who stays with you that a girl is coming over so they can make other plans, basically tell them to fuck off for 1 night.

Dont rush in to fucking, chat a bit, have some fun, maybe get something off netflix you guys can watch, go get icecream beforehand or w/e. Unless she is basically just there to fuck, it is your obligation as a host to entertain your guest, she may not appreciate the gesture, but most people do"

We don't know until we ask. I say this because some straight guys act super concerned that they may ""appear"" gay.

Straight guys, please stop assuming that if you get hit on by gay men that it automatically means you scream GAY! That is often not the case. Many times, we see a hot guy or getting to know one...we have to hit on/ask them. There's not always a flashing sign over a guy's head telling us such.

Also...back to the original question, men are just naturally going to be the ones to take this sort of initiative. Women probably find you equally as attractive, but they don't seem to be nearly as forward as men can be...on average. 

TL;DR...you're probably just hot, and men are going to be more likely to approach you than women. Also, you probably don't look super intimidating...so we don't have to worry about defending ourselves if you react violently."

289,"**The Night &amp; the Morning After: Heat Up the Bedroom with 10 Hot Tips!**

1: **Don't Shower!**

The strong smell of manly musk is a huge turn-on for women. When preparing for a hot date, go two or three days without showering... but if you absolutely must shower, don't wash your tackle!

2: **Compare Her to Previous Lovers!**

There's nothing sexier than a challenge! Be sure to talk at length about how great your prior partners were in the sack!

3: **Notice the Details!**

When it comes time to get naked, speak up! Show that you're really paying attention by remarking on her lopsided breasts, razor burn, &amp; any blemishes you can find!

4: **Foreplay Should Be Forceful!**

If you're the sort of fellow who likes foreplay - &amp; remember, most women would rather go without it - be sure to do it right! Really mash your finger into her clitoris! The harder you press, the faster she'll orgasm!

5: **No Glove, More Love!**

It's a well-known fact that women hate it when men wear condoms. If your partner suggests it to you, tell her that you appreciate the offer, but that you'll go without. Be firm!

6: **Bring It Around the Back!**

Vaginal intercourse is great &amp; all, but if you're hoping to bring your partner's pleasure to the next level, surprise her by slipping it into her anus.

7: **Nice Guys Finish First!**

There's nothing more enjoyable to a woman than having a guy finish in thirty seconds flat. After all, it means she's just that good! To add a splash of romance, be sure to throw a wad of tissues at her then roll over &amp; fall asleep! (She'll appreciate the level of trust.)

8: **Breakfast in Bed!**

Is your lover still asleep? Give her a delightful surprise by waking her up with breakfast... breakfast sausage, that is! Nothing starts a girl's day like feeling you thrust yourself into her mouth!

9: **Keep Her Waiting!**

If she asks you to return the favor, politely decline. The anticipation of waiting for the next encounter will ensure that it's an exciting one!

10: **Whine &amp; Act Pathetic!**

A girl's maternal instinct is a force to be reckoned with! The more childish &amp; irritating you act (by telling her to make you food or letting her clean up your room), the more attractive she'll find you!"
290,Legend has it that if you cum and fart at the same time your balls retract inside forever.

294,"That's too late. You won't have the strength to murder and butcher another person for food at that point, especially if they put up a fight."
295,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Changing how you think isn't a matter of flicking a switch; you need a system of recognizing, challenging, and moving past negative thoughts. 

You'll get a lot of ""just do [this]"" advice which, while well intentioned, doesn't really address the heavy lifting involved. You'll have to make a lot of little changes and spend some time exploring. Find little things that, even if they don't make you happy, at least make you feel satisfied or a little bit less shitty. 

The big thing to avoid is falling into a negative spiral of thoughts and behaviors. Pay attention to the situations that make you feel lonely or desperate and break them down. Can you point your head in a different direction? Can you change your habits or pull in new routines to create a more positive experience?

It sounds like a pile of work, I'm sure, and it definitely can be. CBT isn't a silver bullet, and you'll need time and energy to work on yourself. If you're willing to pursue incremental results, though, it can help. Just make sure that you're trying to get enough sleep, eat the right food, and exercise, too."

I don't see why you don't just date her. Leaving her waiting has a greater chance of her saying fuck it and finding a different dude.

306,"Flirting is displaying romantic interest. That's literally all it is. In certain situations this is clearly meant in jest (I'm a hetero dude and I flirt with my guy friends all the time). But if you're *not* doing it when you are romantically interested, you are effectively deceiving the girl you're interested in. This doesn't mean you have to proclaim your undying love in your opening sentence, but you should certainly be behaving in a way that makes it clear both that you are interested in the girl and comfortable with her knowing that. Believe it or not, how 'well' you flirt is rarely the decider in whether or not a girl likes you, it just helps you find out *if* she likes you sooner.

'Coming off as a nice friend' can mean one of two things:

A) behaving as if friendship is your main goal. This is dishonest if it's not true. If that's what you mean by the question, do not do this, it's classic NiceGuy^^TM behaviour and you wanna avoid that.

B) behaving like a socially normal person comfortable interacting with the girl in question. This is fantastic and should be the basic framework within which flirting occurs. If your question is 'should I seem like I'm interested in this girl or just a normal person wanting to chat' my answer is *why not both?*"

314,"When my wife began to change shape, it just redefined my perspective of beauty. It wasn't that she was hotter or less hot, she was just changing and, because I love her, I just found the changes to be sexy. When she gave birth, I didn't miss her ""old shape"" either... still sexy.

It's hard to explain but I guess it's enough to say that my definition of sexy evolved with my wife. The same way it's evolved as we've gotten older. She doesn't look the same in her thirties as she did at 21 but I haven't felt differently.

That being said, I'm sure it helped that pregnancy is a gradual thing. She didn't suddenly appear with a big belly, so our intimacy had time to evolve. Also, we are both pretty fit people and are attracted to the same, so it probably also helps that she didn't totally balloon (35ish pounds gained by the end).

As for the rest of your question, the sex was okay and I didn't care about the baby being ""next door"". I'm a nurse, so I didn't have any apprehensions or misconceptions. My wife had some degree of nausea for the whole pregnancy and some back pain, so our sex life understandably took a hit, but there was good sex on the good days."

We attribute it to his charisma. He really listens when you talk to him and will ask questions. If you don't see him for a month or two, he'll still ask you about something you discussed the last time you spoke. On top of that he's relaxed in his own skin.
I think all that makes him attractive to women and then when he sees girls that know him on nights out, he finds it relatively easy to go home with them."

366,"I'm the only child of a single mother. My father has never been involved in my life. Here are some differences I've noticed:

* I'm more emotional than your average guy. My mother always encouraged me to talk about my feelings, so being comfortable expressing myself is something that's always been normal for me. 

* I'm also very affectionate. I can't recall a single day going by where my mother didn't hug, kiss me, and tell me she loved me at least twice. As a result I'm very comfortable with all forms of emotional expression, and the absence of any of those is not acceptable for me in a romantic relationship.

* There's something I want to stress because people assume that emotional = unstable. Although my mother was very emotionally expressive with me, she never lost control of her emotions, and the only time I remember her breaking down was when my grandfather passed away. Because of that I have a very good grasp of my emotions and can recognize when I'm about to be overwhelmed and put it to one side if a strong emotional reaction isn't appropriate for my surroundings. 

* I tend to have more female friends than male friends.

* It's very easy for me to commit to a relationship. I think my mother gave me healthy expectations of how someone should treat you when they care about you.

On the flip side:

* I don't relate very well to other men and don't have a lot of male friends despite playing sports my entire life.

* It took me a *long* time to learn not to take teasing badly. Good-natured teasing is common in male friendships, but my mother only ever expressed positive emotion with me (in a light-hearted context I mean - she definitely disciplined me when I deserved it). As a result I came to view teasing as automatically negative. That made me an easy target and made my early teenage years tough sometimes.

* I didn't grow up seeing positive applications of masculinity, so I have a very negative view of traditional masculinity and traditionally masculine traits. This isn't because of any view my mother expressed during my childhood - just my internalization of the behavior of men I observed growing up."
367,"My mom is dead, I wonder if you see her there."
368,"For a first move in such an uncertain situation I'd go for something slightly less involved and less demanding of her. Just a coffee or something, at some time and location that fits into her schedule. But either way, hard to tell for sure what's best but totally worth any shot.

What's a good café she knows about somewhere around the area she's in? Or a nice park nearby? A full-on dinner doesn't give her an easy way out if she wants to break off early.

edit: It doesn't hurt to have some ideas to take this further. What does she enjoy doing? Could you schedule some activity together that she likes? Short hike? bowling? I don't know what kids to these days. You could try to find out over that cup of coffee if you don't know already through facebook stalking. Ideally something lively and engaging, not a movie or tv. If you're a fun person some co-operative activity could work wonders."

* actually verbally tell her that you love her

* spend time with her, take some time out of your hobbies and spend some extra time with her time to time 

* show genuine interests in things she loves, try to participate if you can

* Do nice things like get her  drink or something on the way home even if you are not

* Lighten her load when it comes to chores, surprise her some days and them all, make sure the workload is balanced

* Actually listen to her problems, give your thoughts when appropriate, show support in whatever ways you can. Not just her problems but listen to everything she says and process it, retain it. Possibly bring it up at a later time, be knowledgeable about your girl.

* Be a considerate and giving lover, don't be lazy, put in that work to please your lady. Treat foreplay as sex, ie the main event. Passionately love your woman. Try to break up routines, touch her  

* Surprise her with thoughtful gifts. Just randomly, holidays too but it doesn't have to be one.

* remember important dates like her Birthday, Anniversary, events she looked forward to.

* When she accomplishes something give her earnest praise, don't dismiss her achievements. Don't push yours over hers

* Compliment her on her beauty, her style, her humor, her intelligence, kind acts she does, etc. When she does something little for you, say thank you and acknowledge you noticed, when she paints her nails tell her they look pretty, pay attention to little details. Flirt with her to show your sexual attraction has not wavered for her.

* Do not stray, be faithful and loyal, do not give more praise to other women than you do your own partner. Never say x woman is better than her in x way. Don't be a dick

* Respect her feelings and her emotions, they are not women things, they are not dumb or irrational, they are valid just as much as yours

* Do little things to make her life better, show her that you pay attention and care. This could be fixing her medicine cabinet door, offering to go get her tampons, give her a little massage when she gets back home

* Take good care of her when she is sick. This includes taking her to the hospital, doing a lot of extra stuff when she is sick, she does not really need to be doing much when sick.

* Try to be as cool with her friends and family, if you hate each other then try to be civil if possible.

374,"I did see a study one time that suggested that money increases happiness, but only up to a salary of about $75k annually. Money first increases happiness by providing your basic needs, then your wants, without stressing over making ends meet. But beyond a certain point, having more/better possessions doesn't make you happier.

Edit: People have commented that the exact number needs to be adjusted for inflation, area, etc. Fair point. The point was less about the number, more that money will buy happiness, but with diminishing returns."
375,"Yes. At first it was a rent-free situation while I got my finances under control. I also did general maintenance, mowed the lawn, and some babysitting as part of the deal. It was what it was, I had to get out of the situation I was currently in and they offered me a spot. Got my crap together and they were having a second child so I moved out, now I've got 3 beds and 2 baths all to myself. And if they were in need you can bet your last dollar my door is open for them.

I crunched the numbers, and it would cost my company significantly more money to hire someone to fill my position had I left, than it would to just give me the damn promotion. I have a great relationship with my boss, and basically told him I'd be leaving if I didn't get the promotion, yet HR kept telling him there was no budget for it. He eventually had to go talk to the CEO and explain that I wasn't someone the company could afford to lose, which finally got HR to approve the promotion.

380,"Normally I wouldn't respond as I don't know of a support group but I wanted to give some alternate advice given what I've read so far.

I've known fathers who really warmed up to their kid once they started to share similar interests as they got older.  You can't magically will yourself to care, the only thing you can do is continue to do your duty as well as you can as a responsible parent.

Hell my grandmother felt that way about my mother (by her own admission) but changed her perspective as the years went by.  She was far from an ideal parent when my mother was a little girl but she's been a great parent to my mother as an adult helping her through some major physical and emotional hardships.  They have a very close relationship now.

Read literature written &gt;100 years ago and you'll see a much different perspective on children than now.  I'm not saying to emulate it but it is not like all families throughout history had unconditional love towards their children.

You're probably not going to be father of the year, but that doesn't mean you have to be a bad father.  As long as you try to work towards raising your kid well you might simply come off as stoic."

Coming from a main office full of women, I can only imagine it was the testosterone surrounding me. The men would come in at lunch an during different breaks, we would talk, joke around, there was heavy back and forth flirtation between myself and one of them in particular. Now, I've always been one for monogamous LTRs, but for some reason I developed a fantasy of them all coming into the office all sweaty and tough from their time at work and taking turns drilling me on the various desks.
