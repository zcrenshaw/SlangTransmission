0,You might want to talk to a mental health expert on this one. Because that's a lot of baggage to get over.
1,"I had a coworker who was unable to breast feed her baby. I guess it made her feel like a horrible mother, and other women routinely questioned if she was trying hard enough to produce milk (or something). 

So we're talking about and in my head I'm thinking *good thing there's more to you as a human being and as a mother than ability to produce milk.* What I said was ""If you were a cow, you would be put down."""
2,"&gt;Asking us if you're attractive is like asking coal miners if your kitchen is clean; the opinion you want holds little value because you don't want them in your kitchen to begin with.

That was actually sort of beautiful in a way... I'm stealing this for whenever I get the chance to use it."
3,Hey ladies of /r/askmen! How do you feel about men with astoundingly good looks and rogueish charm that also happen to moderate responses in a community full of 18 year old virgins giving life and sex advice?
4,Gimme a sec I'll ring all my ex girlfriends and get them to ask their current boyfriends this question.  
5,"* A reputation is easy to build, but hard to change or erase, which is why making a good impression from the start is very important

* Networking is the most important thing there is professionally. An employer will always give more credits to someone's opinion of you than your CV and big career opportunities are more likely to come from people outside your social circles you met a couple times than you close friends.

* I always joke that there are two types of people: those who need a therapist, and those who don't know they need a therapist. I think people should check their mental health in the same way they do physical checkups. Our society is pretty fucked up and nobody is completely well-adjusted.

* It's better to regret the things you did than the things you could have done.

* Spend some times with your grandparents. It's important for you and for them.

* Never take ""it's the right time"" excuse not to do something. Convenient times get rarer and rarer as life go on. 

* Do not take the following advice as an excuse to embrace apathy and cynicism, but some things in life aren't fair so it's important to focus on what the effort brings you rather than the effort itself. Yes, you'll have to do more than the girl you want to date to date her. Yes, you might have to work harder than another person to get the job you want. Etc. But in the end, getting what you want is what matters. And if you're an idealist like me, you can still be involved in activism to make our society a little more fair. Remember that some people, because of their gender/sexual orientation/skin color, will never have a ""fair"" life. You can't whine because you need to try harder sometimes."
6,"Once in a bar I heard a guy tell a woman ""You're hot, you know...if good looks were a washing machine, I would put a dirty load inside of you.""

Didn't work out for him."
7,"Men of askmen how do you feel about a woman that gives you blowjobs on the hour every hour, bakes you home cooked meals every day and makes you fresh baked apple pie every night, also walks around in sundresses has a perfect body and wears yoga pants all the time?"
8,"When I was in high school. I was talking to this cheerleader in my class trying to date her.

P: I really appreciate how special you make me feel but unfortunately I have a boyfriend I am so sorry though. If you need help meeting someone let me know. 

Me: Thanks I really appreciate it. (Confidence slowly goes up.)

Later on I found out she really was putting in a good word about me to her friends about good a guy I was and they should think about going out with me."
9,"Yep, dreams. Either I cheated on her, or I was ""mean"" to her."
10,"We were driving down a country lane and a car driving towards us had his full beams on. She looked into them and got dazzled. She was angry with me for both the other car having his beams on full, and the fact that she looked directly into them. She was the passenger. 

Had a few issues, that girl."
11,"If a girl you have recently started dating, asks you ""what do you like about my body?"", the answer ""pleasantly plump"" might not be taken in the spirit it was intended."
12,Impress ladies by having a trash can at the toilet. With a lid! 
13,Talk to a therapist. 
14,She was more of a bro than your bros. A+
15,Fear of rejection...  so many missed opportunities.  
16,"My friends used to call me Gollum, as I would always hit on the one with a ring because I would never look for that stuff.

One night, I started a convo with a lady, she politely showed me her ring and I apologized and said I hope being hit on at least gives her a confidence boost to feel good about herself.

Her hubby was standing nearby and heard that, he appreciated me giving me his lady a compliment and so he bought me a beer. Best rejection ever."
17,"&gt; Men of askmen how do you feel about a woman that gives you blowjobs on the hour every hour

Shit dude, that sounds kind of exhausting. "
18,"A work buddy I was trying to set up. This is how the interaction went.

Me to new girl at job: ""Hey meet my friend here he's a good guy.""

F to girl: ""Hi my name is F and people think I'm weird.""

Girl and I both stare at him wondering did he really just say that?

Me to her: ""See F is a funny guy. He's just kidding.""

F to girl: ""No people think I'm weird. That's why girls don't like me.""

Girl: ""Umm ok"" walks away 

F: ""This is why I like older women they know what they want.""

Me: Stares at F like an idiot before walking away in frustration. 

Surprisingly F is still single also this not the most awkward thing F has done in front of a girl he likes."
19,I've had a total of 12 users send me their SSN and DOB. 4 of them even included their mother's maiden name and 1 went so far as to give me their last 3 addresses. 
20,"If I was assumed dead in a plane crash over the ocean and extensive search yielded no results. Little did she know I was going through a harrowing survival experience alone on an island. After a few years of isolation I am finally rescued and attempt to go back to my normal life only to find that she has moved on and remarried. I don't think I could blame her then. Lucky for me, I would have a piece of mail with another hotties adress on it that I could track down and start a new life with. Or you know, if my wife wanted to have another chance with me, I'd probably give it a shot. "
21,"""Wanna go back to my room?""

""Nah, I have my own room."""
22,"This is my favourite in the thread. I love it when someone makes a leap of logic and then only says the conclusion without context. 

Unless that someone is me. Then I don't like it. "
23,"I've had an essay about why I should be more clear because the person was confused wether to send me his favourite compliments or compliment me or a compliment that had been said to him.


It was quite the read.

26,"I had a man who I was very attracted to when I was 21 and he was 40 tell me ""Darlin I've never cheated on my wife but if I ever change my mind you'll be the only one to know.""
"
27,being a dumbass only counts as one issue.
28,Everyone's saying dump her but that's dumb. She's stressed because she probably has her idea of a perfect wedding and what she wants is getting in the way of your relationship. I would suggest premarital counseling because the question you really want to ask is whether you're more important than the wedding and that's a delicate question that would benefit from a mutual third party.
29,"No, I think in this case he should definitely seek out a male therapist. A female therapist might be ridiculously understanding, but it's best for OP if he has someone he's immediately going to feel a bit more at ease with."
30,"You already achieved the hardest thing: identifying and admitting you have a problem.

Now, you need to see a therapist who will help you get rid of this problem.

Do not think you can do this yourself with a few self-help books. Even if you managed to push-back the fear, resentment, and hate from your consciousness, it would still remain in your subconscious and dictate your life in ways too subtle for you to notice yet too substantial to ignore. Even in the best-case scenario, doing this by yourself would take too long.

It is *really* worth the investment. Also, for obvious reasons I think a male therapist would be preferable because I think it will be easier for you to open-up to a man. Good luck."
31,"OP, there's no shame in improving yourself, usually consulting an expert is the most effective way."
32,Black gay guns should be able to abort climate change.

34,"Three main things: 


1. No one cares about you- In the sense that you don't need to worry about what others think or say about you, because everyone's going through life in their own way. Do your thing, the way you want to, and I promise you no one will judge. 


2. If you want to do something then just do it. Future you will be happy you did, and you won't live with regret. It's a good time to take risks while your responsibilities are not too high. 


3. Get in the habit of being healthy and exercising. Again, future you will thank you. "
35,"I've only had one person actually clearly read ""amour"". His/Her/Other message said ""I LOVE YOU :D"". 

The rest of the jackasses sent me pictures of armors...

Rather disappointing. "
36,"My aunt's husband had a child from a failed marriage before meeting my aunt.  The child's mother doesn't have any visitation rights.

He said that he documented EVERYTHING and went to court on time and dressed nice.  She was an alcoholic and addict so sometimes she was a no show at court.  The judge saw that and it went to his favour.

His kid is 31 now and hasn't seen his birth mother in over 25 years."
37,"The many double standards and false information, probably. Plenty of issues to choose from.

- The fact that boys are doing MUCH worse in education than girls with UK universities warning being born male will be (is already) a social disadvantage. Boys and young men drop out far more due to the feminized educational system, and barely 40% of the university population are male. Apparantly the lack of women in STEM deserves more attention though ...

- The fact that men are twice as likely as a woman to get convicted for the same crime, and that if given a prison sentence, men serve 60% longer prison sentences, again ... for the same crime.

- The way men and boys are automatically viewed with suspicion in society. It hurts to not be able to interact with children without some women immediately pulling their children away out of fear I'll fuck it then and there. When I was a kid, I remember many pleasant interactions with grown ups. And not once was I abused. The media is probably to blame for this. I also notice that when I walk behind a woman at night, I'll slow down or cross the road to not make her feel uncomfortable, or make myself feel guilty or like a potential criminal for doing so. I shouldn't have to do that.

- This ties in with the one above; the lack of male teachers in education. When I was young, almost half the faculty was male. Now, it seems to increasingly be a rarity. Having known former male teachers, something you'll often hear is that they felt the workplace was becoming increasingly hostile towards them. With female teachers and parents looking at them funny and moderating their behavior and speech. Young children need both male and female role models. Also, studies have shown that female teachers (statistically) will give boys lower test scores for the same results as girls. (on anonymous tests, they scored pretty much the same) Which illustrates their bias and how that among other behavior might cause boys to lose interest in education.

- The fact that men are almost exclusively seen as responsible for domestic violence, dispite it being well known by now (especially since that Harvard study) that over 24% of relationships have DV, half of which is recipricol, the other half has one violent partner. And in 70% of those cases, the violent partner is the woman. Women are also far more likely to repeat abusive behavior. Why is this not discussed? Why do nearly all pictures of DV campaigns show battered women? Sure, men are stronger and bigger, but that has nothing to do with it. It's another double standard that needs to go. DV is DV.

- Men represent over 96% of societies workplace fatalities and serious injuries, because we are expected to do the most dangerous and unpleasant jobs, which often also pay quite well. There's always talk of a glass ceiling, but what about the glass basement? Why do feminists exclusively talk about the minority of men at the top of the ladder, ignoring the vast majority of the men at the bottom, that built and maintain society? Where are all the female quota's in the fishing industry? Plumbing? Roofing? Mining? Garbage collecting? Sewage work? Construction work? Etc etc ... The typical answer you'll get is some nonsense about patriarchy and women not feeling safe, but I've known a few women who have done ""male jobs"" and done them bloody well. If a woman wants to do a job like that, they can. The fact that there's so little push for equality in those sectors is nothing short of hypocrisy.

- Men are vastly over represented in homeless and suicide statistics, and yet the vast majority of support is offered to women. Again, mostly because women's organisations get far more funding.

- The bias in favor of women in family courts. And the lack of ability for men to opt out of parenthood the same way women can. (although Finland I believe is currently discussing parental/financial abortion for men if a woman on her own decides to keep a child they didn't agree on, which makes sense to me)

- The disparity in funding for men's mental health and cancer compared to women's.

Plenty more where those came from, but let's face it, noone really cares unless they are men's issues that also affect women...

Personally I think it's time to get rid of ""men's issues"" and ""women's issues"", and simply talk about them as societal issues. No more fighting for funding (which always goes to women's organisations anyway) and simply treating each issue on it's own merrit. I'm so sick of this comparing all the time, although at the same time when it comes to men's issues, I feel it's important to raise awareness and to highlight the feminist hypocrisy, because of all the damage they've done. And yes, I do blame feminists for a lot of the misinformation, ridicule, and lack of attention for male issues, because they have claimed the only place in society to talk about gender issues, but havn't done so for men because it doesn't fit their ideological narrative. And not only that, but they actively disrupt events where men's issues are discussed, ban them from speaking, and silence them any way they can.

I'm not an MRA, but I have pretty much become an anti-feminist in recent years, the more I learned about these issues and interacted with feminists. I'm simply an egalitarian who thinks it's clear that if you put all western men and women's issues next to each other, men clearly get the short end of the stick. And yet women still keep patting themselves on the back telling themselves that they are the only victims, as if all men are floating around on clouds. As if it's a zero sum game. As if looking at all the facts and acknowledging them would somehow take away from genuine women's issues getting attention. Their precious narrative is clearly more important than male lives, which to me is unacceptable.

38,"Had an OKCupid date, we had sex, it was pretty good, but nothing crazy (she was very hot, I was very nervous). As I followed up for second date, she said something akin to ""So, I was thinking about it and I just don't really think we're a match. You're super cute though. This might sound weird but I'd be happy to set you up with a friend of mine.""

I declined, but appreciated the up-front-ness."
39,"Not a friend but yours truly:

Girl: nah I don't have anything going on

Me: Nice

Dude, you're going to have way bigger hurdles than this in your future marriage. Don't bother getting married if you're not ready to tackle them without throwing in the towel.

Planning a wedding is the first big project that most couples undertake together. If she's stressed then see what you can take off her plate."

49,"After she said no, she included this caveat:

""I need to start listening to my head about this sort of thing if I'm ever going to make a positive change in my life. Don't get me wrong, you're absolutely the kind of guy I go for, and my stupid body is 100% on board with this. But you don't exactly scream 'stable long term relationship.' No offense.""

I couldn't fault her for having a good sense of observation."

56,"I think people in general aren't aware of how low most other's self esteem is. A hallmark for a lot of people with low self confidence is the assumption that everyone else is more self assured than you because they're obviously better than you.

So I suspect that a lot of men aren't aware that the ""hot girl"" he saw in his college class actually has crippling body confidence issues and is always worried about saying the wrong thing. But that hot girl may also not realize how hard rejection is for men and assumes that the cute guy in her class has no hang ups because ""Guys don't deal with the same pressure women do"" (or something, just making examples.) 

We are conditioned as a society to feign confidence if we don't have it so it's not always easy to spot the ones who aren't entirely sure of themselves. "

61,"A lot of people are suggesting a therapist... and while that may be the best advice, I want to throw this your way.

Try not thinking of them as women. Don't classify them as 'other'. They're people. Yeah, culturally there are some wide spread similarities with women, and genetically there are some differences... but when they get up at 6AM on Monday they're tired and don't want to go to work, the same as you. When there's someone that they're interested in they're worried about rejection, the same as you. When they're hungry they like a delicious pizza, most likely the same as you. When their next door neighbor blasts their music too late and they have to be up for work the next day they're pissed off, the same as you. There are some big differences, but there are a lot more similarities. 

Now... I know you've met your share of male assholes in life. But you don't define all men as assholes. Because they're people. Some are assholes and some aren't. Women are the same way. Maybe you've run into a string of assholes who happen to be women. Our brains are wired to look for patterns, but you need to rewrite the conclusion your brain is drawing. *People* are assholes. Some of them anyway. Doesn't really matter if they're women or men.

Once you can wrap your head around that, the next thing to do is turn your gaze inward. Are you the kind of person you want to be? If you were to imagine the version of you that you would look up to and admire, how far away from that version of you are you now? Once you have that in hand, leave romantic interests out of your life for a time and really invest yourself into *narrowing that gap*. Invest serious effort and planning into becoming the guy that you would look up to.

Once you're there, you'll be better able to respect yourself and so will other people. Most importantly though, you'll be better able to recognize red flags in how *people* treat you, and you'll be better able to recognize and cut off assholes before they have a chance to dig their claws in and hurt you.

Sometimes the best thing we can do for ourselves in life is to just shift our perspective. I hope that helps."

71,"If she really shows remorse and is willing to redeem herself for what she did, MAYBE I would give her a chance. But to be honest I would be so angry I doubt I would care if she is sad or not about what she did.

Cheating is a series of bad choices, so every time she could think ''Ok, this is wrong'' she kept going, meeting someone else, kissing him, touching him and eventually having sex with him. So it wasn't ONE mistake, it's a list of them, it's hard to forgive. "
72,"So this reminds of a post that popped up in Writing Prompts some time ago.  The gist of the prompt was ""Your dog is old and dying. You're sitting around one day and your dog brings you a crumpled up note - its his bucket list.""

The top post in that prompt thread, the main character takes the note from his dog and starts reading off things. ""stare out window for an hour."" ""chase a car."" ""Bark at neighbor's cat."" ""Watch you when you go pee."" ""take afternoon nap in sun near back door.""

And the whole point of the story was that the dog's bucket list was just to do all of his favorite things one last time, because he already lived the best day/week of its life every week.

So that's what I would recommend...let the cat do all it's favorite cat things.  Snuggle it if it likes snuggling.  Let it lay on the lap top keyboard.  Give it a box if it likes boxes.  And just love the kitty."

3) Compliment her. ""The other day you smelled like pomegranates. I bet you have some grapefruit shampoo, too. Do you?"". 

4)  Mention some details so she knows you remember her well. ""So, I was looking through your credit history. I see you spent a decent amount of money at JC Penney's a few months ago. You like clothes shopping? I bet you'd look amazing in some of their sundresses. Mmmm.""

5) Say something deep and emotionally revealing. ""When I was just a wee lad growing up in the vast wastelands of New Hampshire, I thought to myself, 'in this moment i am alone, but someday i will find a feeemale who will let me put it in her butt and then I will become one with Katar-Ru, Conqueror of the Universe'. I believe YOU are that woman.""

6) Slip a little innuendo into the conversation. ""I'm having hotdogs for lunch. They're so small compared to my giant schlong. It's like comparing a tic tac to a pool noodle"". 

7) Send a photo of your nipple, then your dick, then your butthole. Be sure to include a weapon in the background (or inside your pooper), so she understands the implication that if she rejects you, it might not go so well for her.

I made her meet up again with the guy, grab drinks and food, go with the guy to her place, start up four play, fuck him, kiss goodbye, rinse and repeat for months. I wrote it like this incase anyone thinks it's their fault. It's not your fault. Think about what goes into the act of cheating. All the chances they have to understand and realize that what they're about to do is wrong. It's disgusting. If I hadn't gone to therapy I would probably still think it's my fault.

87,"I had full custody, periodically, through raising my kids. I had them full time. She maybe saw them for a weekend, every other month, for 15 years, however, this is the basics of my story:

Ex-wife leave me. My sons are 3 and 6. We divorce, and she does a no contest, 50/50 divorce, leaving me all properties, and disappears. A year later, I file for full custody, and get it, along with accompanying child support. After one year, she resurfaces, takes me to court, and gets 50/50 back. She disappears. Also worth noting, the court battle wiped out what she owed in child support. 

Another year of her being gone, I go back to court. I get full custody, and child support. After about a year, she shows up, takes me to court, gets 50/50, and disappears. Again, wiping out the child support she paid on my lawyer. After that, I'd be a retard to go again. I just kept 50/50 and never rocked the boat. She only saw them a few times a year. Oldest is 18 now and youngest is living with me and 15.

I had a dream that you were cheating on me with your cousin. And you being nice right now makes it feel like it's real and you're trying to make up for it!"" To be fair, my cousin is gorgeous, but seriously, what the actual fuck."

95,Funnily enough this is actually one of the things I was complimented for repeatedly. Out of boredom I ordered a designer trash can online to put next to the toilet. Put in small trash bags so I could clean it easily and it won't get dirty. I never use it myself because I simply don't have anything to throw away. But I actually had girls tell me that it was so nice and thoughtful of me to put it there. What?!

When people in our work area offer to teach him because he's too old not to know and maybe it will help him meet girls. F will get mad and tell our manager people are picking on him. So now F gets rides home with this girl he likes (but never lets her know he does).... and her new boyfriend.

102,"Told this story before, but - sleep sex. 

We had an incident once where we drank alcohol and had sex, then passed out. Suddenly, I woke up in the middle of the night and I was on top of her, and she was asking me to put on a condom. I was a little bewildered because I didn't remember initiating, but we finished the deed. 

Anyway, a few months later, something similar happened. I woke up to her telling me ""stop"" and realized I was fingering her. 

Despite my insistence that I had no memory of initiating this contact, she interpreted it as me ""taking what I wanted."" 

Finally, we did some thinking and research. She realized ""sexsomnia"" is an actual thing and basically forgave me. I figured out the main factors that seemed to lead to me initiating in my sleep: drinking a significant amount of alcohol, having sex, and falling asleep naked, and tried to reduce them. Well, mainly I made a point of putting boxers back on after sex. And it never happened again. "

Woo boy is this ever correct."
120,"Whoa, this sub is full of these kinds of threads. But to give a list, not in any order:

- Despite being driving for many years, never an accident and even driving since I was young in Ireland, she was the worst back seat driver ever. She would constantly belittle and demean everything I did in a moving vehicle until I would actually make a mistake. Then it was like hell on earth. Contrast this with the fact she was majorly unsafe as a driver; two of our friends even would refuse rides from us on account of her. When she had her first accident, I wasn't even in the car but it was my fault.

- I started training hard to lose my weight. I was obese for a while. It was a joke. I was once having dinner which was essentially chicken salad. She spent the first half of the evening taking the piss while I was prepping up. I was even making her dinner. It escalated to when we were at dinner, I'd just started eating, she walked in with a big pack of sugar and threw it on my plate laughing at me. The reason was because I liked brown sugar in coffee.

- I was doing a service on my car, changing the oil etc. It was an old car, a few various problems, but it was still ""safe"" and running. About four months later, the alternator went on it. I was outside changing it when her parents popped over. Cue lots of ""Don't let this guy work on your car, he just fucks them up!""

- We were out with a couple friends. I was coming out of the bathroom, she was coming in. For some reason she just started kissing me passionately. I fell for it. I thought I was on that night. She ended up laughing with her girlfriends that I was a moron for thinking that way and that I looked like a rhinosaurus, that I snored like a hog, etc. I didn't get it.

- We were helping a mate move. We were carrying boxes down from the flat into the rental van. Or rather I was, they were upstairs ""packing"". Third van load, a lamp I'd stupidly placed on top of a box I was carrying dropped and smashed. They came flying out to see what happened. I apologized and offered to replace it, the mate was all OK with it. She smacked me on the back of the head, I almost dropped the box. She hit me again and I did drop the box. She called me an idiot and walked back into the room they were packing. Her mate was stunned, I just waved it off and began packing the box back up.

- In the worst time, I was sleeping in my car. She had done a few things, the police had been called. The cops recommended I left the property as she was drunk, despite my being covered in my own blood. I slept in my car for about six weeks. The house was being prepped for sale at that point. I only ever returned to do renovations as long as someone was with me or I knew catagorically she would be out. 

To pre-answer any questions...

- When you're in an abusive relationship, you don't know it. I know that sounds fucked up, but you really don't know it. 

- I didn't know how to get out, we were in a mortgaged house, our friends knew us as the inseperable couple, our parents were both friends and saw each other regularly. 

- Yep, I was depressed so didn't care I was being fucked with. I'd gotten to the point of suicide more than a few times. I even had a good spot picked out. I had a sealing sandwich bag in my car containing my passport, driver's license and a rock that would weigh them down. I also had a spare key to the car in there, thinking wherever I did it, if the car was badly parked I didn't want to be a burden.

- I was off women for about four years. I went through despising them. I went through not even able to talk to female members of my family. Even today, if I'm at work, I am never alone with women. I just don't trust them still.

Things have gotten better though. I have had a few girlfriends since then and recently met a really amazing girl. I still have a few trust issues but she knows all of the shit I had been through. I pretty much spelled it out.

If your other half, man or woman, is doing anything other than adding to your life, making you feel happy and feeling like a man/woman, fucking leave. Don't hang around. Or you'll end up where I did, on top of a bridge by a pike wondering if you can jump right to crack your head open when you hit the bottom."

Roommate: I can't, I don't have any shoes on. (bruh...)

Girl: Well I could just stay here then...

Roommate: Might not be comfortable, we don't have any spare blankets. (bruuuuh...)

At this point I'm assuming he just doesn't want to have sex, but after explaining things to him while she was in the bathroom the problem became clear. It turned out he'd smoked a tonne of weed before the party and had no idea what was going on. Damage was done at this stage. She was clearly very insulted and left."

136,"I'm not really sure if this is considered classy but I appreciated it anyway. So a friend and I kept running into a girl he use to work with when we went out.  It happened probably three times in a month. We hit it off pretty well but I'm a slow.  The third time we ran into her I decided I had to make a move and I asked her out. She started telling me about she'd just broken up with her boyfriend and that she was about to move back to her hometown. As I'm standing there accepting defeat she then said, ""Im moving but that doesn't mean you can't come back to my apartment tonight"".

""Genderfluid"" or more than 2 genders is bullshit and perpetuates gender roles. The idea that feminine men or masculine women are less men or women is pretty awful. Being Genderfluid and having your gender change based on how you feel is sexist because it's basically saying men are supposed to feel this way and women are suppose to feel this way. I went to a college with a high gay population and I didn't meet a single feminine gay guy who didn't identify as Genderfluid. Like, why can't you just be a feminine guy?

150,"Having a real tangible set of criteria helps. What constitutes ""being ready?"" Is it something you can articulate that with words?

It gets old really fast when someone wants to play gatekeeper with physical intimacy in a relationship. No man with healthy sense of self worth is going to wait around while you determine whether or not he has met some vague criteria known only by you. Especially if they have options.

Another factor is consistency. Have you done this with every male partner? If you have a different threshold for how long you'll wait with different guys, it's going to set off every bullshit alarm he has.

Above all, you have to recognize one simple fact - the amount of time you wait has little to no bearing on whether or not this will be a serious relationship. You can't buy your way into relationship legitimacy by placing a temporary embargo on sex. That just isn't how it works. Progressing to a serious relationship is contingent on one thing and one thing only - whether or not both people involved really want that in the first place. If the two of you really hit it off and you both want something more serious, when you have sex 100% does not matter.

If the way he feels about you is different than the other women he is dating, that's going to show in his actions. I was dating 4 other women when I met my wife. She almost immediately became my top priority, and I broke off everything else to keep pursuing her. And you know what? We ended up tangled up in bed within hours of physically meeting. That was 10 years ago. I'd say it turned out alright."

200,"I'm a girl, but I witnessed two dudes have this moment with their other friend. 

Went out with a group for a ""girls night,"" one girl I already knew, the rest were friends of hers that I hadn't met. One girl is married, I'm dating someone, two are single. Some dudes are dancing around us all night, one dude is acting kind of douchey to the married girl, so I tell the other two guys (who seem cool) that their friend is either too drunk, or just an asshole. One guy gets defensive of his friend and they just leave us alone for a while. 

We end up talking to them outside after the bar closes, and they are nice again. One of the single girls is flirting with one of the dudes so we are all kind of encouraging a group convo. Weird friend comes over and says something to married girl along the lines of ""you should come home with me"" and one of the single girls says no she's not going home with you (probably just because her friend is married and she wanted to spare her explaining it). He turns to her and says ""wasn't talking to you ugly bitch"" and of course all the girls are very instantaneously not so friendly anymore. Me and another girl start telling him to fuck off, and now all the sudden we are all ""dumb ugly cunts"" including the girl he previously wanted to go home with him.

The look on the other guy's faces were the only redeeming part of the interaction. They seemed genuinely surprised by his behavior, in their defense, but the fact that I had warned the one dude made me feel so so gratified. I kept saying ""I TOLD you your friend was too drunk, and I TOLD you he was an asshole."" And they were alternating between being like DUDE WTF STAHP and WE ARE SO SORRY OMG. 

Then we climbed into a cab while their friend continued to yell at us and made a point to tell the two nice dudes that they need to find better friends. "

212,"The first few times, nothing bad happened. It was kind of exciting to break the rules about safely ejecting USB devices before removing them. After a while, I started to notice some data corruption on my various external drives. Then it moved on to needing to reformat the disk, or a failed component on a mouse. But, no big deal, right?

Before long, things started going downhill, and fast. My beloved cat, Harvey Thensponapolous, died right after I ripped a multi format card reader cable out of the USB port. A few days later my car caught fire when I quickly swapped a thumb drive from the 2.0 port to the 3.0 port. 

Even though my life was falling apart, I just couldn't break the habit. My boss fired me after I failed to eject the bluetooth dongle before removing it from a company laptop. The water pipes in my house burst after failing to safely eject a USB video game controller from my gaming rig. 

The thing is, I won't live long enough to regret my poor decisions. Last week I failed to safely eject a fingerprint scanner from a customer terminal.

I don't agree with anyone who says you shouldn't change who or what you are to please other people. You should definitely do that if the result also pleases you. It's only a problem when you try to change in a way that makes you unhappy, or means you aren't being true to yourself.

She wanted to do things so she would call and I would ALWAYS drop whatever I was doing to take him. After a couple months of having him a few days a week I filed and won. Then I continued documenting every time I had him more than my 2 nights a week and after a couple months I filed and won 4 days. This continued until I had him 5 days, but was actually keeping him 6-7 nights per week.

Immigrant Rights really means **Illegal** Immigrant Rights. At this point, you can go fuck yourselves. No other country on the planet will allow you to come in and demand shit. Apparently, you can get all the benefits of America by just stepping on its soil. On top of that, while receiving said benefits, you say bad things about **the country that just gave you those benefits!** 

Black Lives Matter: I sympathize. I really do. Being a minority myself, I know how hard it is. However, When you say the same shit over and over again and your own people (yeah I said it) do not fucking get it... you have a problem. When the message is Black Lives Matter (**too** - yes I read that post and I agree with the sentiment), but in the same breath tell white people to fuck off, your message becomes (**Only**) Black Lives Matter. 

LGBT...: I actually have no issue with this group save 1. The Gender Identity crowd. You feel like a woman trapped in a mans body? Feeling more manly than girly? Your skin just doesn't feel right? Tough shit. I would have loved to be 6 feet tall, red headed and Irish.  There are no hormones, growth shots, stem cells or hair plugs that will make this happen.

When I encounter these tragic, traumatic situations, I go home at night and cry it out.  I talk to my colleagues, I talk to my wife.  I talk to my boss.  It's important to process what you've been through.   It's more important to not turn to vices - that just puts your emotions on hold.   You will have to deal with the emotion at some point, and it's much better to just do it now, sooner than later.  Bottling it up isn't healthy.   

You were the Good Samaritan today.  You talked to him.  You comforted him.  You did the right thing.  I'm sorry that you had to witness that and fill that role.  But you did the right thing.  And what you're feeling is normal.  "

272,"When I was a teenager, there was this amazing girl in our circle of friends who I was really attracted to. She was really cute, funny and great fun to hang out with. And incredibly pretty. But nothing happened at the time because I assumed the feelings weren't mutual (and I'm oblivious to any flirtation anyway).

When I was about 17 or 18, I moved away to a different part of the country with my family. That girl and I slowly stopped staying in touch and I began to think about her less and less. That is until, one morning about a year later, I woke up to a message from her on MySpace, explaining that she'd always had feelings for me but hadn't said anything at the time because she assumed the feelings weren't mutual. She wasn't expecting anything to come of it but just wanted me to know.

I couldn't believe it. I'd never had anyone express interest in me like that before (well, not so directly that I actually noticed it). For it to be coming from her... it was like a fairytale or something. So I messaged her back saying I felt the same and we chatted for a little bit. We were both giddy with excitement. All the while I was thinking about all the great times we'd had together and how much fun I always had when I was around her and eventually I just thought ""fuck it"", I'm not going to ignore this. So I told her I could come and visit. Today. Like, now. I was so excited to see her again and she felt the same.

Train tickets were going to be expensive and I was skint at the time but I'd have emptied my savings to see her again. So I packed some overnight stuff, told me Mum I was going to stay with a friend, took the next train to the coast (a few hours away) and we arranged to meet. I decided I'd just find somewhere to stay while I was there, whatever. She explained she was seeing friends later that evening but we could spend the afternoon together just the two of us and then I could join her in the evening and we'd hang out with her friends and I could stay at hers.

So that's what we did. Mostly anyway. It was a hot sunny day so we spent the afternoon just lying around in the cathedral gardens, catching up, reminiscing and talking shit like we used to. At some point we went and met her friends. I got know them a bit, just hanging out, making the most of the summer's evening, drinking beers as night fell. She got introduced to some new people who were friends of her friends and she got to know them a bit too. In particular this one dude who seemed more interested in getting to know her than he did me. I didn't think much of it though, even when she disappeared from the group for a while and I noticed he wasn't there either. Although eventually, I decided I'd better go and see where she was as I was meant to be staying at hers and it was pretty late by this point.

I found them. They were making out like they were the last people left on the planet. She was pushed up against a wall with her legs wrapped round him. She clocked me, stared at me and just said ""sorry"". And that was the last time we spoke. I stayed in the spare bedroom of some friend of hers who I barely knew, tried to pretend like it was all cool and got the train back home the next day.

Told Mum I had a great time with my mate. Went off to have a little cry in my bedroom and tried to forget about it and move on. Which I have done - but I have such vivid memories (both good and bad) of that experience and how I felt at certain points during it. It's really stuck with me in a way."

274,I disagree. I feel like women treat men without confidence how men treat ugly women. You just disappear into the background and they don't think about you at all.

276,"Long story, but I'm going in on it. So I dated a girl for about a year. I'd had a pretty strong connection with her, but as far as a long term partner goes, we weren't very compatible. She has a very soft disposition and although I had a great deal of fun with her, I knew I'd need a stronger woman later in my life. 

One evening, I had a dream about a girl I was good friends with in middle and high school. I had always crushed on her and was sort of in the ""just a friend"" position, although we were very best friends and she was even my first kiss. So there was some history and she had helped me through many issues in my past, so it makes sense that in my dream she helped me. We were sitting in a car driving and I told her I was nervous to join the military and become a pilot. It would be an 11 year commitment. She told me, ""It'll be over before you know it"" and I responded ""I know, that's what I'm afraid of"" and then I saw flashing lights in a rear view mirror and I was jarred awake. 

So, I send her a text, asking how she's doing, what she's up to. And one thing leads to another, we still have a bunch in common, we are hitting it off like there was no time gap between us now in our 20s and when we were just tweens. We end up going on a trip overseas, bear in mind, I still have my girlfriend. This was a shit bag thing to do because I really should have left this girl before I went because it was incredibly likely that I'd cheat on her. And I did. But I fell head over heels for my old best friend. 

I immediately started dating her, but there were lingering feelings for this girl I had dated before her. And I ended up sleeping with her a few more times over six months or so. Fast forward two years later... I'm thinking about marrying the girl I've been dating, but I have this big lie on my back about cheating on her. And I'd been drinking to sort of subdue the guilt and self hatred that I'd been feeling. Which is a whole other issue, because it ended up getting me into more trouble than it was putting a band aid on, but I'm digressing. I felt if I was going to have an honest relationship with this woman, I'd need to tell her about the infidelities or I'd never be able to be honest with her about everything and I'd never be able to have a pure marriage.  

So, I told her. She hates me now. Occasionally she'll text me to tell me about guys she's hooked up with. Or tell me that she hates me. And doesn't miss me. That she never loved me because our life was together built on a lie. It's pretty painful, but I deserve it, so I'm not complaining. 

You asked for my biggest mistake. This is it. Never start into a relationship unless you're ready for it. Don't cheat, ever. Don't lie, ever. Enter every relationship as if it would be your last because if it turns out that you're going to marry this person, the demons in your closet will haunt you. And just as a side note, don't ever ever talk to one of your exes while you're in a relationship. My life is a complete and utter fucking mess. I wish that I was the man I am today when I started dating her. I wish I had known the things I know today. If I'd been who I am now, I'd still have her. "
277,"I lived by myself last year. I now live with 5 people. Fuck do I miss living alone. Weird shit included:

2. Only clean when I wanted to. It was still pretty frequent but still, it was on my schedule.
3. Sleep wherever I wanted. Passing out on the couch was not uncommon.
4. Eat whatever, whenever. Ice Cream for breakfast. Meals at 3 A.M.
5. Lounging naked, jacking off in the living room, porn on the TV

318,"We have this friend I'll call A that says the stupidest things whenever he gets high or drunk. One time the A, the guys, and I got high before we met up with a girl acquaintance before hunting for parties. On the way to meeting them, we made some small comment that she probably wasn't going to bring friends, because why would she hang with us if she already had friends. A believed that she was going to bring friends, and we left it at that.

When we finally meet up, we find out she had some attractive friends with her, and A blurts out ""See I told you she was going to bring friends with her."" After trying to get him to shut up, he made it worse by explaining that we betted on whether she was going to bring friends.

The night was just weird after that and nobody talked to each on our solemn walk to a party.

319,"I don't know if I would go that general with it. The aspects I think get underestimated are -

1. A lot of men don't have any perception of the their own sexual desirability, or even of what is physically attractive about men to begin with. To them, they're just an ugly hairy thing with a gut and an unimpressive, average-sized penis. The only way women would ever *possibly* want them is if they demonstrated something to offer beyond that.

2. Many men don't see themselves as having 'the upper hand' in any way. To them, women have all the power, because women have what they want/need and get to decide whether men get it or not.

3. Along those same lines, a lot of men are freaked the fuck out about being seen as a scary rapist predator. They have this sexual desire that is a big thing to them, and they want to share and have be accepted, but wonder if they share it will they get not just rejected, but seen as creepy or scary or gross, or heck even get in legal trouble if it's perceived badly enough.

One day I came back to our dorm to find him sitting alone on our futon. I asked him how his date had gone. He told me that she left kind of suddenly, and it looked like she was crying. When I asked him what happened he said, ""I'm not sure. We got dinner on campus, the conversation was good, and then we came back here to watch a movie. A bit into the movie I held her hand. She didn't pull away, so I assumed everything was okay. Like 30 minutes later I leaned over and told her that I thought she was perfect, and I was so glad to have found her. Then she ran out.""

I know not to expect texts/calls when she's with friends families. I get jealous of them. I get anxious waiting to hear from them. But I keep it all to myself. I know it's unreasonable to assume I can be with her all the time or texting every second we're apart. We still talk a great deal just not when at work or with other people. So I keep it hidden from her because I know I'm being unreasonable and I'm very happy with her. "
368,"The frustration from me from this perspective is that *asking* someone to do their share of chores is  emotional labor by being in *charge* of asking. The implications fall that if you didn't ask, he'd do nothing.

Idk about mom and sons. But as a wife that's my perspective. And this obviously doesn't apply to emotions as I can't expect him to know my feelings without communication. But I appreciate it when he just *does* things around the house instead of waiting for me to ask. Who asks me? Why am I in charge? "

- Backhanded compliments. Alright cool not reading much into it but certainly know what it could mean.

- The usual emoji trail 😂😂😂😜😜😜 alright cool seems like she is trying to flirt.

- Always wanting me to hang out at hers. Movies all that. Okay. Seems kinda an ""into me"" thing but still could be a friendly thing.

- Towel pictures. She was showing off her hair after a shower, look you don't need to show me you're only in a towel too. Alright now I'm definitely getting the idea here.

- Panties picture. Wasn't wearing them, but was showing me what she picked out for the day. Sexy stuff with a lace-up front and made it a point to point out they were a little transparent. Alright hint definitely taken now.

- Steering the conversation sexual, multiple times. Duh, she wants the dingle dude.

""Oh I just see you as a friend I trust you."" Oh. Didn't realize you showed off your see-through panties to your pals, alright cool whatevs.

In hindsight she seems to be the type to prefer men who just take what they want and push past the half-hearted ""boundaries."" Hey, whatever floats her boat but when a boundary is put up I'm going to take it at face value, not force my way past it. Too much potential to misread and mix up the real boundaries from the ""hehe I'm just putting up this act to play hard-to-get"" ones.

Edit for a little clarification on the boundaries thing: I'm not talking that standard play-innocent just-pretend-its-a-boundary, I'm talking fairly hard no's. When it seems a firm ""nope not happening,"" I'm not gonna push it. And if they're putting up firm boundaries with the intention of having a guy push past it, yeah that's a little weird for my taste."

You can use your dick sucking prowess to conquer many of life's little obstacles. Got pulled over for speeding? Suck that dick! Long line at the supermarket? Suck your way to the front!

382,"Here's the thing.

- If he's looking for hookups, there are a tons available. Good looking, smooth talking peoples in the late 30s are the top of the dating/fucking totem pole amongst all the newly divorced &amp; single mothers. If he was looking for that, he would just move on to someone else that's also looking for it.  

- If for some reason he's getting a kick out of fucking women who ""are not looking for hookups"", then it's just a contest of how patient he is vs how long you are willing to wait and demand him to date you before inviting him into your bed. Well, except that he's seeing other peoples. In any case, you can not know it, and it should be quite rare. 

- If he's looking for a LTR, then you're still for some reason requiring him to prove some sort of commitment by waiting out some sort of trial period. Except that again, he's dating other people, and fear of intimacy doesn't rank high on the ""qualities"" spreadsheet.

My opinion: You met someone that seem to be a great fit. You have doubts about his intentions, but you have zero ways of assessing whether he's lying or not, and you have no leverage because he's an attractive man with other dating prospects.   Be honest, have sex with him if you want to. Otherwise don't, one of the possible consequences is that he'll go elsewhere. (It really sounds like ""catch him with your vagina now !"", it's not my point, I'm just pointing that he's another human with his own goals). 

IMHO, I'm not into hookups either, but I'd give it 5-ish dates before moving on if sex isn't somewhat on the table. I like sex, I'm not interested in peoples that feel like using it as a bargaining chip. No need to start anal on the starbucks table at the 5th date, but it should be ""I'm not sure, but I feel like making out on the couch"", and ""Let's both do a STD panel"" territory. "
383,"Many women I've asked out have been very gracious and mature about rejection, saying how they considered it a really sweet and flattering gesture but that they either weren't interested in dating at the moment or they didn't feel the same about me or that they weren't in the right frame of mind. 

Unfortunately this has started to frustrate me too as they pile up. To use a baseball analogy, striking out still sucks even if you worked the count and made the pitcher throw 12 pitches. You can be an extremely disciplined hitter and still get into a wicked bad slump.

I hate ghosting but I understand it, women die of thirst in the ocean on online dating apps (while we fellas die of thirst in the desert). Nobody has been outright cruel or malicious to me in saying no, although one person was maddeningly indecisive.

But don't act like that's a core tenant of BLM. It's not part of their goals and it doesn't do anything to help them. They did also not burn down any towns. A movement can be peaceful even if some of the members are not. 

My friend posted that heartbreaking dash cam footage of the PHD candidate who was tackled and arrested because the police received a tip that the dude stole his own car. My friend said ""that could have been me. I graduated from the same school, I lived in that area."" Black Americans have been shown time and time again that the police are not their friends. After segragation made it difficult to prosecute someone for being black, they just used any sort of drug use as an excuse to jail more black people. 

They're scared of the police because the police have tried to put them in their place time and time again. BLM is trying to protect black people from the police. They are trying to save lives. To get to their goal, they may disrupt a bit. More than some folks would like. But they wouldn't be making this noise if they weren't scared of dying by the hands of your own government."

438,"So many other threads in this subreddit talk about judging women based on how fast they move to having sex, with most coming to the conclusion that sex too soon means the woman isn't worth as much.

It isn't about ""gatekeeping"" at all, it's about not being used and discarded after the sex when you have genuine feelings for someone."

440,"I'm 28 but so far a big thing I can say is your brain develops a lot more as you age and you build experiences, build knowledge based on them, learn to take care of yourself better regardless of what life throws at you, and feel more secure with life's ups and downs.  Essentially, your anxiety is probably going to be higher in your 20's than your 30's."
441,"And most importantly a tasteful fedora. A Trilby will do in a pinch, but it's probably best if you just keep multiple fedoras so you can match them to your current attire and euphorium levels."
442,"Wife while standing in the way of the garbage: Can you take out the garbage?

Me: Sure, can you move so I can get it.

Wife: One second.

Wife still in the way, not having moved: Well, are you going to take the garbage out or not?

Apparently she was angry that I didn't shove her out of the way.  When I raised that fact, she did concede that she might not have thought it through.  To be fair to her, neither of us were well rested because of kids, so we were both a little brain dead."
443,How would she feel about your username?
444,"""I'm flattered but I'm asexual and like you too much to lead you on as things won't go where you would probably hope they do. I will be thrilled to spend time with you though because we do have a lot in common.""

We have since become pretty good friends."
445,"Not my friend, actually me. I was totally unaware of girls showing interest in me in my mid teens. This one evening, me and my friends are out and we're hanging with this group of girls, friends of my friends.

Anyway, I'm chatting away with this one girl and she says 'thejestermk2, I need some advice, I'm really horny'

To which I sat in silence for at least thirty seconds before saying 'well, you best go home and sleep it off'. Got up and walked off to see my pals. Only clocked about a year later. "
446,"My allergies. 

On Christmas Day we went to her sister's house and spent it with their family. They forgot to mention that they have a cat. I'm allergic to cats. After about an hour I  my nose started, then my throat and then I saw their cat and I had to excuse myself and run to Walgreens to pick up some allergy meds. Came back and after about an hour the drowsiness starts, then I fall asleep on their couch in the other room. 

The day after my wife was pissed at me complaining about how I didn't participate in any of the stuff they were doing and that all I did was sleep all day. 

First off it's fucking Christmas, and if I wanna sleep all day long, I'm gonna sleep all damn day long. Secondly, how the fuck do you forget how much I was sneezing and hacking that afternoon, especially after you come to me asking me what's wrong?

450,Not me but heard of a young mom who left her kids with a boyfriend or some guy friend.  The small children ended up leaving the house and walking around the neighborhood unsupervised - they found the guy passed out on the couch from drugs.  Mom lost her kids. 
451,pissing after you had to really *really* bad
452,"Let's see, if you insist on being approached rather than approaching yourself, then this is my advice:

* Doing things alone - If you're always in a group then you're less likely to be approached by a shy/introverted man because he's more likely to be by himself too.

* Being the first to smile - A shy/introverted guy is less likely to be aggressive, so by smiling you signal that you are available to be approached for conversation.

* If you are hanging out with a friend or friends, not conversing too loudly or being the ""loud one"" in the group - Some shy/introverted guys like opposites, but most shy introverts would rather be with someone who seems to have a quiet introspective personality like themselves."
453,"An hour. Matched on a Friday evening, said I was looking to make evening plans, she agreed so I got on the tube and met her. Never got her number and we didn't see each other again after that night. She was pretty cool though.

If he only needed to follow the book we would just fill out forms for a computer to read instead of going to court.

Yes, I know the American justice system isn't perfect. But my point as to why a judge *should* care still stands, even if many/most don't."
460,"Get it something heated to sleep on - I stick a hot water bottle (towel-wrapped) in my cats bed and he loves it. 

Food: aside from canned food, try milk in SMALL quantities (like, tablespoons at a time), or let him/her lick salt/butter. I wouldn't suggest any of the above to a healthy cat, by the way. 

Another person said catnip - you can get it in a spray format, just be careful with it... "
