0,"Her to take charge.

She likes me being dominant, but sometimes I just want her to push me down on the bed and ride my face til it's glazed like a donut.

A man can dream.

Edit: Grammers and stuff"
1,"I used to browse and post there, I found it's kind of an echo chamber, and the opinions there don't really reflect those of women I actually know. One stark example, I was telling a story there about how I went to visit a girl in another state after she told me she was going to have sex with me, but when I got there she wouldn't, and said ""You should have known I was being sarcastic."" I was kind of miffed about it, but didn't push the issue.

The response of AskWomen: ""In spite of the circumstances, she was under no obligation to have sex with you. This whole thing sounds a little rapey.""

The response from women I'm friends with: ""What the fuck is wrong with her? You dumped her on the spot, right?""

In other words, not much, because I don't think the opinions expressed there really represent the views of women in general."
2,"The Puma, the king of all fuck moves.

Basically I would ask my girlfriend to lay on the bed spread eagle. I would climb onto the top of the dresser, growling like the big cat i am. In one move, no hands, i would pounce from the top of the dresser and insert myself without guiding my member or her moving a muscle.

You only get one shot at the puma, you either succeed and get it in, or you break your dick."
3,20+ is considered later on? fuk
4,"I honestly don't feel the women there are an accurate representation of women in general. I have a lot of women I am very close to, and very comfortable with. On occasion I have asked them about threads on there that I simply disagreed with. Most of the women in my life agreed with me, and disagreed with the consensus of the thread.

An example of one that I read said something to the effect of ""No man can ever call me a ""girl"", you call me a girl and were gonna be fighting. The fucked up part is we never call men ""boys"". We have more respect than that, but they call us girls like we're these dantey helpless things.""

I get called boy all the time by girls. And I'm never offended by it. My female friends will say something like, ""Oh no boy, I know you did not just say that!"" (teasingly of course) My girlfriend will say ""You going out with the boys tonight?"" Calling men boys is incredibly common, and every woman I know does it. I'm not offended by it. But that entire thread every woman in their was raging at men for being so sexist by calling women ""girls"" like it was this horrible thing to be called a girl.

I'm not sure who the target audience of that sub is, but I do not believe that it's mature women."
5,"Wait, so she told you she didn't want to have sex with you and you didn't push the issue? That sounds like the opposite of rapey. That sounds like respecting the fact that she said no."
6,"You have a female friend that's roughly your height? Wear her jeans. Get that bulge a showing. You got a button up shirt? Put that shit on. Buttons? Fuck buttons. Leave that shit open, put those 3 chest hairs on display. Have sunglasses? Wear them, no matter the time of day or position of the sun. "

21,"Y'know how sometimes you analyze an interaction with someone after the fact and it goes one of two ways in your head? 

I. E. :

1.) That interaction was positive and there's no way they misinterpreted me. 

2.) They took it the wrong way and, despite my good intentions, they not only think I'm a cockwaffle but I also fucked up their mood/day. 

It's always number 2. It's all shit. "
22,"Dated a journalism major for a while. REALLY wanted to be a TV news anchor of some sort, and I promise this will become a mildly relevant fact. 

She took me back to her place and we played a board game of some sort. Had a good time, got up to go. She slammed me against the wall, and started rubbing my other head. Looked me dead in the eye, slapped me and said ""You're blowing your two pump dump all over the back of my throat."" Never lost eye contact, and it was an INTENSE look, it wasn't a request, it was a pure statement of fact that I would follow. She then gave me the most intense blowjob I've ever had. My knees buckled and I went crashing to the floor. 

I was helped to the couch, given a glass of water and, again TOLD, ""You have 45 minutes to recover."" We played another round of our game and I was manhandled into the bedroom, where she climbed on top and used me as she saw fit. When she had finished, she gave me that intense look again and just started...going. Not going for her anymore, going for me.

And holy shit did she go. I had never before, nor ever since, been ridden like that. She knew exactly what was happening at every moment, and when she could feel me building up she leaned down and whispered ""This just in..."" and I blew my baby batter all over her insides. ""...you finished gloriously.""

I don't think I miss any girl as much as I miss her. She'd get a look in her eye and I knew it was fleshy dildo time for me, and I would be rewarded generously."
23,Threesome with two hot girls I just met.
24,"A girl I was seeing ran down the steps of her front porch, down her driveway, and jumped into my arms when she saw me pull up.

28,"I'm not sure, but I'd ultimately not be standing in the way. I'd rather my hypothetical 15 year old daughter have those things if she needed them than go without.

Thankfully, this situation isn't in my near-future. Gives me time to think about what I'd say in the meantime."
29,For her to come to me without asking in her lingerie or naked and tell me she wants me to fuck her right there and then. Won't ask because then I won't feel it's her choice to do it. 
30,"Cool, but... don't ever let her hear that."
31,"I got a list as long as my arm of kinky crazy stuff I want to explore. But I could be content if she just wore some lingerie and gave me head once in a while. 

She's in grad school though, and for those that don't know that basically means 60+ hour weeks for 4-6 years. She doesn't think about it.

She is so wonderful in every other aspect of our lives Im willing to wait. 

And why don't I bring it up? Because an obligation blowjob is so much worse then no blowjob. "
32,"I'm not sure how old you are, but I *can* tell you this: My dear friend had those same thoughts and doubts and quiet little nags in the corners of his head. And... went through with marrying her. It started slowly when they were dating. She was cool enough when they met, so he shushed himself when doubts would arise in a slow, subtle way. In his own words, he never did think that he'd stay with her *too* long, but something-something-frog-in-water. 

Year 1 came and went and it was still pretty fun and casual. They met each other's family and friends, and she was pretty tolerant of his video gaming and weed smoking, and they had a good time, so they kept dating. 

At year 2, same deal. She was hinting at moving in together because her lease was about to be up and ""it was time."" She instead moved on her own to a place closer to his house, giving him another year in her lease to delay facing the issue of whether he truly wanted to live with her. They continued to date, go out to eat, do couple-things - not *too* much in common hobbies-wise, but he tried going camping with her because she's outdoorsy, and she tried lazing at home on weekends because he's not, at all. Differences like that can be charming in early dating, and you both try to compromise. And you don't really have to think about if you want to be dragged along camping your whole life if it's a 2x/ year thing with your girlfriend, so, you don't think about it

Then, 3 years in, she firmly wanted to move in, and nothing was *drastically* wrong, he just didn't feel 100% into it. He felt like a dickhead delaying it more, and 3 years is a LONG time to date without any progression, and he was still living with his brother and smoking weed and drinking and having a good ol' time all the time, and not seeing her a lot - she was pretty patient at first, and didn't nag him about the weed and booze; (that has since changed and she wants him to 'act like an adult') So, he moved in anyway. It wasn't great, but he still saw his brother a lot and saving money was nice - plus, it got her off his back from saying ""we never do anything together"" (which, spoiler, you tend not to over time if you have no hobbies, interests, or ideologies in common). Then she got a dog that he never wanted, and that added to their lives being tied together. 

Then, at about year 4, her sister and friends were murmuring about getting engaged since ""they'd been together so long."" So, they did. In their engagement, I never once heard him enthusiastically call her his 'fiancee' - it was like he couldn't say the word aloud or something. He also never fully changed his mailing address from his brother's house - there were small ""tells"" that were pretty clear - people speak volumes in the words and small actions they choose. They pushed the wedding date back, twice. She went out of town the summer before the wedding, and he spent basically that whole summer at his brother's (like, actively avoiding going to his own house, which was also telling), voicing doubts and concerns and complaints about a LOT about the relationship - her exorbitant debt, their dynamic, their lack of commonalities, her sisters, that she wants more dogs. NONE of their wedding speeches mentioned them as a couple or that they are strong together - I paid deliberate attention because I do think that what your loved ones say about your relationship speaks volumes.

 SPOILER: Literally none of these doubts have improved at any point. She was supposed to get her financial shit together ""after the wedding/ after this birthday/ when she turned 27/ when her dog's vet bill was paid/ after she graduated college"" and... she didn't. He is now in dozens of thousands of debt, and all the doubts he had and concerns he voiced are no closer to resolving. He is seemingly talking himself into it, yet again, after they got married like he did when they were just dating - he *has* invested thousands paying off her debt, and other sunk cost fallacies, after all. 

The point is: the path from ""casually seeing a cool chick that is fun for now"" and ""married and tied down and has no time for video games and is constantly nagged to do chores and drives an hour each way to a job that he hates for a wife that feels completely entitled to his existence and thinks she gets a medal for existing and a mediocre blowjob once per month, while reminding him how lucky he is"" (my friend isn't *quite* there yet, but give it another dog, or baby fever, and I'd put money on it) is really, really, really slow and creeps in. BE CAUTIOUS WITH YOUR LIFE! 

It's really tempting to talk yourself into a dynamic that you know, deep down, in your heart of hearts, isn't right for you. Perhaps there's promise of change or you think that ""all relationships take work"" or you feel like an asshole for wanting to end it when there's nothing wrong like cheating or abuse. But. Do yourself a favor and don't be a bystander in your own life. LISTEN to those doubts. 

**TL;DR-** Nearly every divorced person I know has one statement in common: they knew, well before the divorce, that they should have broken up the first time their psyche told them so

E: formatting, added phrasing, thanks for the gold! If I could impress to young people one thing about relationships, it'd be: breaking up is infinitely easier and kinder than divorce, and 5 years, in the span of your life is NOT a long time - don't give into the sunk cost fallacy! "

The ""I'll answer yes to everything, and ridicule my partner"" was brought up in the first thread I read where Mojo Upgrade was listed a couple years ago.

My wife had not done that, but has become very sexually conservative. Apparently wedding rings have the power to drain female libido. Having children is the equivalent to a Mortal Combat Finishing Move to libido.  I'm painfully aware of the issues this has on a marriage, and I'm working diligently to correct this and many other aspects of my marriage."
60,"In one word, my life is complicated.

I am a single gay man living in New York City, and I chose to adopt older children for at least 4 reasons.

First, I wanted a child who was completely aware of what was happening, and would be 100% on board with having me as his father.

Second, I did not want to fight anybody for an infant.

Third, I already had 4 small dogs (3 Italian greyhounds and a Basenji) and didn't want to further complicate my life with an infant's requirements.

Fourth, I wanted to give an older child an opportunity that they believed they could no longer get.

So how did I end up with 3 teenage sons?

I initially went to adopt a 17-year-old Puerto Rican kid living in a group home in Long Island. There was nothing particularly outstanding about him, and I mean that in the best way possible. I think on some level I just said, ""OK you're my son now. I'm willing to put up with you, if you're willing to put up with me.""

I soon met his best friend, a 14-year-old Black kid who he had known for years and luckily happened to be living in the same group home. He wanted me adopt him, too, and so he became Son #2.

After Son #2 was adopted, I found out that Son #2 had a biological brother who was separated at a young age and adopted by a woman. I do not know if this woman knew that he had a biological brother also in the system. Son #3 is legally not my son, but at this point nobody cares.

So what is my life like?

Well, today I'm a 44-year-old man who (because I chose to adopt older children) has 3 adult sons and 1 granddaughter. My relationship to my sons is better than I could've ever hoped. But it's certainly not traditional. I feel older than 44 because everyone else my age has children in elementary or middle school. Maintaining friendships was hard, because you definitely miss out on all of the things that your friends are doing with their younger children.

I don't want to make this comment too long, but I will answer your question about the adoption process.

I am now 10 years after the fact, but the process still haunts me.

You will learn firsthand that the system is not designed to serve the children. The system is designed to protect the agencies. That will break your heart. There are things that were never explained to my sons, and were never explained to me. There are questions that you will never get answered. There are people who you want so badly to cause physical pain to. On one hand, you could read this and think that I am dark and psychotic. But on the other hand, what I think you really need to understand, is that this process will really force you to fight for your child."
61,Meditation. Thought it was a load of fluffy bull with no substance.  I'm now super chilled and very relaxed.  It's great.
62,"On Christmas my GF sat me down before we went to her family's house so we could talk. She then started to read a letter she wrote about how thankful she was for everything that i've done for her. She was going through a depressed, stressed, and anxious phase because of her parents and school, but i guess i was able to help her a lot. We had been in a kind of ""on again/off again"" relationship over the past year, but that Christmas was when i realized how much she cared and that all i wanted to do is make her happy."

&gt; what's the ""one-thing-led-to-another"" part? 

Both parties send signals, one of them escalates things with physical contact like touching a hand or leg and then, if the other party doesn't reject that offer, moves on to kissing and eventually foreplay.

Sometimes things can be kind of blurry even after all that in which case I'll ask how far she wants to take things.

I'd assume that movies and pop culture tend to skip these steps because showing an hour of flirting, making out and touching would be boring.

*Me -* Yeah not my cup of tea, but you do you bud. You're a cool guy, I can't think of a single thing I give less of a fuck about than your sexual preference.

*You -* Thanks man.

75,"I've felt like that, now and then. But overall I've found I'm happier in a relationship. 

The last time I broke up with someone, I really enjoyed the single life in the short-term. It was nice not to rely on anyone, and not have to coordinate my schedule with anyone, and to play video games all day sometimes, etc. 

But after a few months I got kinda bored. Disclaimer: last time I was single I wasn't able to get laid. So it's possible if I was getting laid more I might be comfortable staying single longer.

I don't believe that's indicative of womens' general opinions or experiences but when the rules are that strict, there's a limit to how much fun you can have.

You're not worried about flopping because you're not going to hit on every girl you talk to. You'll talk to anyone and everyone. But you're only going to escalate with a girl who's receptive.

You're not in your head, over-thinking it. You just take the next step if it feels natural. 

You see someone across the room. Does she make eye contact? Does she look away--but then look back? Does she smile? Green light.

Go over and talk to her. Keep it simple, don't use an elaborate line. Ask her about what she's drinking, make a quick comment on the music, etc. 

Then introduce yourself. Get to know here a little bit. Tell some stories.

If you see some opportunities to crack jokes, tease her a little, do it. However, try to stay away from self-deprecating jokes, it's too easy to seem like you're seeking her approval. 

Pay her the ultimate compliment you can give anyone: listening. You don't need to constantly come up with new things to say. You can play off of what she says. If she's giving one-word responses, might be better to just gracefully bow out.

Don't worry about being witty, just concentrate on being *present.* Be with her in the conversation, not in your head, judging every thing you say. Make her feel like she's the only girl in the room.

Body language helps. Turn your body towards her. Practice good posture, which makes you look confident.

Let the conversation flow naturally. If you have a different opinion on certain issues, don't be afraid to voice it. A little arguing can be good foreplay. Don't agree with everything she says just so she'll like you. What she'll really like is a man who stands up for what he believes in.

Eventually, there might be a lull in the conversation. Check in with yourself: is it an uncomfortable silence, where you just want to get out of there? Or you'd love to stay in each other's presence without saying anything? Or maybe you're both nervous but don't want to leave each other? (that's sexual tension).

If you feel one of the latter two, suggest you both should go somewhere more private. Leadership is sexy. 

Not necessarily leave the party yet. Maybe go outside for a smoke, a quiet corner, or out on a balcony by yourselves. Create a plausible excuse, e.g. ""It's really noisy in here, want to go outside for a bit?""

As you're walking together, this is a good opportunity to break the touch barrier. Offer her your hand or elbow, because you're such a smooth gentleman. Or touch her lower back to guide her through the crowd. Touch is confidence, touch is saying you're comfortable with being physical.

When you resume the conversation, try standing closer. Maybe touch her shoulder or arm more in response to what she says.

Does she mention being single, or having recently gotten out of a relationship? Does she mention her roommate(s) being out of town and she has an apartment all to herself? Or is she from out of town and feeling lonely? She may be setting the stage for you to make a move.

She finally laughs especially loud at something you say (even if your joke wasn't funny). Does she keep looking at you and smiling? Giggling? Staring at your lips? Even better, does she mock-punch you and/or push you away (""You're too much!"")? Consider kissing her.

Have fun making out with her a little. She'll be more free to kiss in private, since she doesn't have to worry about being seen by her friends and other guests, and being judged. If you're both up for more, go to your place or her place.

Depending now how good the chemistry it is, you could use an excuse like watching a movie, or just simply ask directly like, ""You wanna get out of here?""

Flirt publicly, kiss privately and reserve sex for when you're totally alone together.

California1234567 had a good post from the girl's POV:

I'm the girl, here's one actual recounting. We met at a party. Danced a little. Drank a little. 

Talked a little (all the basic stuff, where do you go to school, what do you want to do in the future, what kind of music do you like/movies have you seen/books have you read). 

Moved physically closer and closer to one another over a period of about an hour or so, until it was so incredibly comfortable to feel his arm around my waist and to lean toward his ear to say something so he could hear me over the ambient noise.

At one point, his mouth touched my cheek as he was telling me about a class he was taking. I turned slightly, his lips brushed mine. We smiled at each other, then leaned forward and kissed fully. 

Then I said something like ""It's kind of crowded and noisy in here, isn't it?"" and he answered something like ""Yes, and hot, too. How about we go outside for a few minutes?"" 

We went, then leaning against his car, kept talking for a while longer. Then he said, ""Should we get out of here?"" I said, ""Yes, we can go back to my place, but my roommate might be there, if you don't mind."" He didn't.

We went. I offered drinks and snacks. He asked if I was getting tired. I said no, just the opposite. 

More kissing, escalating to touching. I led him to my room, we undressed, and sex happened (twice, and then a third time the next morning).

Hope these are the kind of details you were looking for! :D

156,"Here are some flirting tips.

As a general guideline:

* What's subtle to you is invisible to him.

* What's obvious to you is subtle to him.

* What's obvious to the point of embarrassing to you, is starting to be visible to him.

Not sure if girls plan it out or just do it naturally, but what works best on me is when girls have ""warmed me up"" a little first with casual conversation. So that when they do finally ask me out, it feels natural and it's easy for me to say yes.

The following may seem like a lot, but many women have gone through many of the steps in one conversation, and closed by asking for the date. Some girls are really smooth.

Here is the process:

* Bring up some excuse to talk to him: class, work, etc.  Then transition into talking about interests and your personal lives.

* Express interest.  Put away your phone, maintain eye contact, and be attentive. Lean in closer to him when he talks. Forget about playing hard to get--that just makes it easier for the guy to think you're not interested. Be engaged in the conversation. 

* Flirt. Girls who are flirty with me from the start will stay out of the female friend-zone.  Be careful with teasing though; some girls don't know the difference between light playful teasing and hurtful insults. When in doubt, err toward being *complimentary* rather than critical, e.g. ""Ooh, I think it's hot when a man [does X],"" not, ""You'll have to learn to [do X] if you ever want to get a girlfriend."" Breaking his balls is not sexy. Stroking his ego is.

* Compliment his appearance.  Guys hardly ever get appreciation, so you'll stand out immediately.  Seriously, I and my guy friends will puff out our chests for a week if we get a sincere compliment from a girl who isn't our mom or relative. **However, make sure to compliment *him,* not just his clothes** (this is a common mistake since clothes are how women compliment each other). Otherwise, he'll assume you like his clothes and shrug it off.  Lots of articles advise women to tell men, ""Hey, I like your shirt.""  Only to have the guy completely miss the hint she was into him. Compliment his face, body, skill (guys pride themselves on skill) etc. Women want to be more than a sex object; men want to be a sex object.

* Offer your phone number first before he asks.  That one is a blatant green light for me.  But get his number too, if it was an accidental meeting and you might never see him again.

* ""Direct approach"": Ask him out on a ""date.""  Actually say the word, ""Date.""  Hinting he should ask you out often does not work.  If you use subtlety, you'll complain to your girl friends later how he doesn't notice.  Use your words and you could be on a date with him tomorrow. Edit: this is more effective in person, not over text or e-mail or Facebook. Via technology, the guy might talk himself into thinking you're joking or you meant that for someone else you were chatting online with. 

* ""Self-invite"" date, e.g. when he talks about a cool bar/restaurant/whatever he discovered you say, ""I'd love to go there! Are you hitting it up later this week?""

* ""Reminder"" date, a good follow-up to the ""self-invite"" date: ""Hey, when are we going to that great bar you told me about?

* ""Student"" approach: you see a guy who's good at something, e.g. throwing darts. You introduce yourself and ask him to teach you. Commence flirting.

* Shy Girl's Stealth Strategy. The girl suggests cool upcoming events: new movie, concerts, shows, etc. Naturally weaves them into the conversation. Eventually one would catch my interest and I'd just react and say, ""Yeah, I'd love to go to that."" Then she says, ""Great! Let's go together on Friday. Meet me at seven."" So smooth that I'd only realize *hours* later she had set me up to ask me out.

* If you want him right now, try to get him alone. ""Hey, it's kinda loud in here, want to go outside for a bit?"" If you really want to go further, suggest splitting a taxi or inviting him back to your place. Or if you're going to his place, ask him to see his bedroom, and make a move on him then.

* Physical touching.  Guys are taught to keep their hands to themselves around women, so a guy will definitely notice if a girl breaks the touch barrier.  You don't have to grope him, but touch his arm in conversation when you're emphasizing a point or laughing at something he says.  

Here are some bolder moves, more suitable for a party/nightclub/bar situation.

Bold: put your hand on his thigh.  

Bolder: sit close to him and press your thigh against his thigh. Or if you're sitting across from him, rub your foot against his leg.
 
Boldest: sit on his lap and put his arm around you. Some girls ""trip"" and fall into guy's laps. Like a dumbass, I've helped girls stand up and sent them on their way, when they actually wanted to talk to me. The more persistent ones stuck around and talked to me anyway.

If you're dancing, dance closer. Grind your body against his.

Keep escalating unless he makes it clear your advances are not welcome. 

**Negative tactics**  

Some girls do these things to attract guys, but they actually repel guys. These should go without saying, but I'm including them for the sake of covering all bases.

* Try to make him jealous.  Flirting with other guys in front of him, talking about how you get asked out a lot, etc. Some girls do it thinking it lets her crush know she's ""in demand."" In most cases, the guy treats it as a sign of *disinterest,* e.g. ""Damn, she flirts with all those guys but never flirts with me."" Or he might actually be disgusted by it.  ""Jesus, no way would I want a girlfriend who flirts with every guy around her."" The problem is girls are turned on by competition in relationships, while most guys are turned off.  

* Complain about guys trying to physically escalate with you. Some girls do this to plant the idea he should make a move. Reverse psychology. This backfires, because the guy will assume the girl doesn't want *anyone* to make a move on her. He doesn't want to be labeled a ""creep"" like all those other guys, so he does nothing. Then he gets confused later if he hears from her (or through her friends), complaining how he never made a move. Disclaimer: not all girls do this.  

* Criticize any girl he's dating, e.g. ""Nah, she's no good for you"" (""Because I think *I'm* right for you!"").  Worse, be rude to the girl if he introduces her to you, e.g. ""Oh, so *you're* [name]"" (looks her up and down to size up the competition). 

* Open the conversation by insulting him.  house_robot explained this really well in another thread.  

Quote:
&gt; 
&gt; When a girl says, ""Oh you're a player aren't you?"" its similar to when they say shit like, ""Oh you want me to go home with you? You sure you don't have other girls there already?""
&gt; 
&gt; Its the female approach to giving a man a compliment: passive aggressively, and couched as an insult. Shes letting you know you have desirable qualities.
&gt; 
&gt; When girls say this type of nonsense to you, never confirm or deny it.

It took me a while to realize this was a thing. I'd meet a new girl, she'd break my balls, and I'd be turned off. Hear later she liked me. WTF?

The key thing is to make it obvious *you're treating him differently and better* compared to other guys.  Like if he sees you hugging every guy, then he'll second-guess your interest and think you're just being friendly if you hug him.  

I thought this was a good example from a past AskMen thread titled, *""Men who have had women make the first move on them, how did she do it?""*

The user deleted their account, but this story was still up. Might be too aggressive for some, but the girl's confidence was attractive.

&gt; My personal favorite: As I was randomly leaving a bar, a girl I'd never seen before grabbed my hand and said ""You can't leave! you're so cute!"" 

&gt;I told her she was very sweet and very cute herself but that I had to leave and that I had a girlfriend, and she goes ""Noooo! Can I at least give you a hug?"" I said of course and she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek during the hug and said ""Sorry, I had to! Your girlfriend is very lucky!""
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of the girlfriend (still my SO today) she was my good friend a solid year and change before we started dating. One night after some wine she asked why I never was into her, while swearing that she wasn't actually into me.
&gt; 
&gt; The next day when I brought up the conversation to her she said ""yeah well maybe I was lying about not being into you."" I told her that I think she's awesome but that I don't date my friends, and she replied ""We'll see.""
&gt; 
&gt; She spent the next month and a half just being super cute, sweet, thoughtful, and adorable towards me, even after I told her again I wasn't going to change my mind. Eventually, I did.
&gt; 
&gt; I later learned from a mutual friend that she confided that (paraphrasing), ""I know he's not going to change his mind, and I'm okay with that. But I still want to make him happy and be an awesome friend to him, even if it won't make him like me. He deserves it.""

The worst thing that can happen if a girl is too subtle in her flirting: [case study video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtsNbxgPngA). I'd watch it again without sound to see more of her signals she's interested.

Hope this helps. Good luck."
157,"I'll focus on the useful advice, although there was plenty of the other kind too.

**Mom:**

She would warn me about the games that some women played on men. 

My theory was that she'd seen her brothers end up with the wrong women, and she was worried I'd suffer the same fate as my uncles.

**The Cute Approach** -- She bats her eyelashes, uses her baby-talk voice, fakes stupidity and/or incompetence, etc.  Gets you to play Daddy.

**The Angry Approach** -- Questions your manhood, compares you to her friends' boyfriends/husbands who do those things for them, etc.  Tries to get you to ""prove"" yourself to her.

**The Pity Approach** -- Tears, crying, accuses you of not loving her, makes you feel guilty and abusive, etc.  Wants you to be the caring protector.

**The Seductive Approach** --Self-explanatory.  

They don't necessarily happen in this order.  Although the cute approach tends to be first and the seductive approach usually comes as a last resort.  

It's really hard to deal with at first, especially the pity approach where it triggers your protective male instinct and guilt at appearing ""abusive.""  Most (decent) guys cannot stand feeling like that and cave in. 

One more:

**The Reasonable Approach** -- She talks calmly to reach an agreement on your mutual needs, and works out a compromise that leaves you both mostly satisfied.  Most of the women I've met who do this are quickly scooped up into stable relationships or happily married. 

Mom also warned me about unstable girls who try to get guys to save them. Nice guys are really susceptible to wanting to be heroes and rescuing them. You'll try to lift them up, but they'll end up dragging you down. Don't let a girl emotionally blackmail you by threatening to hurt herself or you. A relationship is not a hostage situation.

Re-reading that, wow that is such a cynic-fest. I should add that she's given positive advice too. But it's the negative stuff that sticks in my mind.

**Dad:**

A suit on a man is like lingerie on a woman.

Don't shower her with compliments. Be the kind of man she'd love to get one compliment from.

If you ask her out, anything she says that isn't a ""yes"" is a ""no.""

No matter what she says when she's flirting, if she stands you up, she isn't really into you.

Your commitment has value. She has to earn your attention the way you have to earn her affection. 

What her friends are like is what *she's* like when you're not around.

How her mother treats her father is how she'll treat you.

What she says about past boyfriends is what she'll say about you.

If she doesn't have hobbies, her relationship is her hobby.

Beware if she seems to be living a lifestyle beyond her income. Expensive clothes, nice car, luxury apartment, knows all the best restaurants, etc. Someone else might be paying for it. If you date her, you'll be paying for it.

How clean she is, is how organized she is in other parts of her life. The converse is also true.

One of the hardest relationships to leave is if you and the girl click in every way--except sexually. A couple's sex life usually defaults to the partner with the lower sex drive.

If she gives you an ultimatum between choosing what's best for you and staying with her, choose yourself. 

For context: he said this when I was telling him how some of my high-school friends were planning to follow their girlfriends to colleges, regardless of whether the college was right for them. Most of those relationships failed within the first few months, leaving the guys stranded in colleges they didn't want to attend. It's simpler when you're younger. It's more complicated if you're older and married.

Don't get so focused on chasing the girl in front of you that you miss out on the girls around you who might be more interested. The girl in front might be higher maintenance than the friend who has a crush on you. 

Right girl, wrong time can hurt more than wrong girl. 

Man, how right he was. The obviously bad relationships were painful but you get over them. You know why they didn't last. But meeting the right girl and losing her due to wrong circumstances? Oh man, that haunts you for a long time.

Naturally, I thought I was too smart and was idealistic about how good people were. My parents were just being negative and cynical. I wanted to believe the illusions.

So I had to re-learn some of those lessons from personal experience. Whereas I could have just listened to them and avoided a lot of trouble. C'est la vie.

This could be part of the problem. The old ""I don't feel that way about you, I just love you like a brother"" line isn't JUST a way ugly guys get friendzoned by their hotter friends. It's possible that these girls envisioned you as a platonic, brother-like, ""safe"" figure (safe in the sense of non-sexual). You showing that you wanted it to be more than that may have crossed some internal boundary, the same way they'd be weirded out if their brother tried to make out with them.

The vast majority had very many ""justifications"" for their shitty behavior, and received a lot of support from others. It was very disheartening to see, because I have seen posts in that subreddit vilify men who cheat. It's a very one sided fuckfest.

It's not particularly fun to get sand in one's foreskin or urethra or in or around the anus for that matter.

190,"Met a girl in Ireland on the first day of a 7 day tour I was taking.  It was basically the start of a long, solo European trip I did.  We hit it off immediately and spent the entire tour together.  In fact, at the end of the tour the tour leader told me she thought the girl and I were together and had been dating for years.

Anyhow, back in Dublin after the tour, we made plans to go out for one final date as she was flying back home the next morning (she was Australian but visiting her mom who lived near London, and went on the Ireland trip as a mini-vacation).  We spent the night together having dinner, walking around Dublin, and enjoying each other's company until late in the night when we finally had to part so she could at least get a couple hours sleep before her flight in the morning.  

We were standing by St. Andrew's Church saying our goodbyes when she burst into tears.  I asked what was wrong and she said (paraphrasing from my memory here), ""It's unfair!  It's so unfair to meet someone like you in a situation like this.  I don't want to leave you.  I don't want to leave this.""  She cried, we embraced, we kissed, we looked into each other's eyes, all that stuff.  Eventually she had to go, we couldn't stand there in St. Andrew's shadow forever, and she turned and walked away toward her hostel.  She said she didn't want me to walk her there because it would only mean ""another goodbye, and I don't think I could do that.""  I watched her walk away as the streetlights shone down on her like spotlights guiding the star of a play off stage.  When she got to the end of the block she stopped and turned back and waved a simple wave.  I swear I could still see the tears on her face reflected in the glow of the streetlights.  She turned once more and rounded the corner out of my life.

I felt like I was in a fucking romantic comedy or something.  I half expected some sort of ""comic relief"" moment to happen next, like I would turn around and immediately see a dog taking a shit or something.

191,"Hope you don't take too much offense to this, but this probably near tops the list when it comes to things women say versus what they do.

192,"Had a relationship that became a long-distance thing after a while. My girlfriend was a budding artist on DeviantArt, and was constantly inundated with requests and commissions. It came up to Christmas, and I was feeling pretty crap at the time. My grades weren't amazing at the time, my dad had to stay up at his parents house to help take care of them over Christmas, and my other family members were pretty.... Well, unpleasant. So talking to my girlfriend, she sympathised and wished I could come stay with her family for Christmas (not really a possibility due to the cost) which would have been a dream come true at that point. Obviously, it didn't. 

But to try and make me feel better, she postponed all requests and commissions while she made *me* something. It was a large landscape drawing of me having Christmas with her and her family. Looked so picturesque and perfect, and you could tell by the detail that she invested a lot of time and effort into it. I was speechless! She also sent me a heartfelt letter explaining how she wanted my Christmas to be good, and that's all she'd want this year. Well, that and for me to be with her. Really became an overload of emotions for me, and improved my Christmas a ton. 

Just a shame that relationship didn't work out, we were nuts for each other. "
193,"I'm the girl, here's one actual recounting. We met at a party. Danced a little. Drank a little. Talked a little (all the basic stuff, where do you go to school, what do you want to do in the future, what kind of music do you like/movies have you seen/books have you read). Moved physically closer and closer to one another over a period of about an hour or so, until it was so incredibly comfortable to feel his arm around my waist and to lean toward his ear to say something so he could hear me over the ambient noise. 

At one point, his mouth touched my cheek as he was telling me about a class he was taking. I turned slightly, his lips brushed mine. We smiled at each other, then leaned forward and kissed fully. Then I said something like ""It's kind of crowded and noisy in here, isn't it?"" and he answered something like ""Yes, and hot, too. How about we go outside for a few minutes?"" We went, then leaning against his car, kept talking for a while longer. Then he said, ""Should we get out of here?"" I said, ""Yes, we can go back to my place, but my roommate might be there, if you don't mind."" He didn't. 

We went. I offered drinks and snacks. He asked if I was getting tired. I said no, just the opposite. More kissing, escalating to touching. I led him to my room, we undressed, and sex happened (twice, and then a third time the next morning). 

Hope these are the kind of details you were looking for! :D"

196,"All are different.  There's a lot of childlike frustration I see online with men getting upset that they hear women say things like height/money/whatever don't matter and then they see women who clearly value these and similar traits.


I've known women who married ""down"" from their league because they met an honest, hard-working, good-future-father guy.  I've known women who all through their life ruin stable relationships to be with the abusive never-has-a-job douchebag. I've known women who are genuinely attracted to generally unattractive men.  I've known women who only date conventionally attractive men.


The difference is that when one person says what they like, they're speaking for .0000000000000001% of the population.  Just because you can go online and hear 10 women say they hate big muscles and fancy cars doesn't mean that a big muscular guy with a Ferrari isn't going to pick up the women that do like those things.


In general things like confidence and having your shit together (financially stable, in decent physical shape, etc) manage to attract most types.  But the specifics from there-on-out are completely based on the individual."

I texted her back 30 minutes later and said, ""that hurt"" and she proceeded to call me to tell me that my hurt feelings were not her problem and she wasn't responsible for them.

You're assuming.

&gt; she's had some boyfriends before and expects me to know how to kiss :s.

You're assuming.

You're also thinking too much about it. Good kissing is something you feel out. So you know how in kissing, there's a general ""opening mouth into closing mouth into opening mouth"" rhythm that happens? A good kisser will be able to follow along with that rhythm. It's hard to find that rhythm if you're thinking too hard about it. Just slow down and focus on her pacing and try to match it. Learn her timing and open when she opens, closes when she closes.

Fun fact: Most people will generally kiss you the way they themselves want to be kissed. Pay attention to that and go along with it. Do they start using tongue? Throw in some tongue. Are they going fast? Slow? It's a dance, and it's about figuring out what kind of dancer they are. That said, if their dance is too...something for you, feel free to try and dictate the pacing. Are they being too aggressive? Try to kiss them more gently to simmer them down. Guide each other and learn from each other."

I had my first date at 24, which was just a shitty one-time online thing. Then was set up through friends, dated that girl twice, didn't really see it going somewhere but definitely wanted to try to date her a little longer, but she blew it off. Then I didn't have any date for three years. Not that I didn't want to, but I don't know, it just doesn't come natural to me. Early this year I re-installed Tinder after using it for years without any success, and in the last two months I've had dates with three girls. One was a disaster, the other one I really liked but she blew me off after two dates, and the third one was at least somewhat of a success (dated twice, discussed that it wasn't really going somewhere, still boned a few times).

It's so goddamn difficult. Being single for so long has made me very independent, so I have a very low tolerance for mind games or doing 'the chase'. I would like a grown-up partner. Of course having this dating record, I'm not the most confident man around women, so that plays a role. And finally I just don't know how to meet eligible and at least somewhat attractive single women."

No shit, we learned not to be emotional or vulnerable because we receive serious social consequences from both men and women for it (and from my experience, more from women, and more serious qonsequences.

The pro to this was that I knew a lot about myself and who I am and who I want to be. Also through observation, I knew how to be in a relationship. My girlfriend even told me early on that she couldn't tell I was in my first relationship.

281,"First and foremost, what I said is the fucking truth.  I've already had a few guys reply with their own personal experiences agreeing with me.  If you ignored girls when your hormones were starting to explode and go on your first date in your twenties, it's going to be difficult.  It's going to be difficult because you have a lot to learn and it's going to be difficult because while most of your peers went through their phase of stumbling and struggling to figure out how romance works they were surrounded by people who were going through the same thing, meanwhile you're going to be surrounded by people wondering why you're so socially awkward around women.

And that's the truth.  Does it suck?  Of course!  But should I lie instead?  When a guy comes here, a place where men can ask other men weird and awkward questions free of judgement and ridicule, instead of telling him the cold hard truth should I tell him everything is gonna be fine, you have nothing to worry about, and give him about 7 seconds of feeling good while leaving him thoroughly unprepared for what he's about to actually experience?

Not only does lying do no good, it could actively harm people.  If everyone on this thread says that a guy starting to date in his 20's is in for a struggle then when he goes out and has trouble dating he'll understand that's normal and keep trying.  If we all tell him he has nothing to worry about, that missing out on up to a decade of social development will have absolutely no effect on him and then he goes out and repeatedly strikes out with women he's going to think that there's something fundamentally wrong with him. "

283,"To be honest I think I've learned more about myself here than guys. Don't get me wrong, I've still learned things about guys that I will use for the rest of my life. But mostly I've learned here how to act around guys. I was (and still kind of am) homeschooled growing up, I never got to talk to boys my own age. I had very few, but close friends. All of them were girls and from the church I went to. I never learned how to socialize with the opposite gender. Because of this I thought that being bitchy, cold, and standoffish was the only way to act around guys. I went to a public school briefly in the sixth grade, I was a sweetheart to the girls and teachers there. But when it came to guys, I was rude and insulting. To my suprise non of the guys wanted to be my friend, for a few years there I avoided all guys my age like the plague. Why bother trying to get to know them when they're not gonna respond back? I came across this sub about a year ago and started reading threads about what guys thought was unnatractive, one thing I noticed was a lot of guys saying how they hated when girls were mean. That's when I realized that the problem wasn't guys, it was me. I've not only began to be nice to guys, but I've also started being nicer to just everybody in general. It's amazing how much nicer guys are to me now that I'm not insulting them and putting them down! I feel incredibly guilty for the way I treated guys back then, and I wish I could apologize, but I have no way of contacting them. I'm so grateful for this sub though, it has really opened my eyes to my behavior.

313,"Just the time aspect, in a few ways. 

My wife is pretty disorganized, and if we're going somewhere, it always seems to take an extra 10 minutes to leave because she forgot her wallet/phone/keys/sunglasses. 

Also she's more social than me, which means we go to more social stuff, and stay much longer than I normally would. Single me at a party would stay 2 hours or so, then do a quick goodbye and go home. With my wife she has to have a 5-minute conversation with everyone at the party before we leave. "

The reason guys only want sex is because the women they want relationships with are so saturated with validation that they don't consider them as partners, but guys don't want to just never have sex so they fuck down for the sake of getting laid."

321,"0 or low amount of chest hair, hard to lose fat even when working out / eating well. Hard to put on muscle.  Trouble sleeping.  Low sex drive / weak erections. Lazy / unmotivated / content to watch TV a lot.  I started on T a few years ago and those are the things that changed for me."
322,"See, I've been been in situations like that when I was younger, just a couple of times.  And maybe my experiences with that have fucked me up.  Here's what happened in both cases:

Both times it was a girl I'd known for years and was very comfortable with, and she came over to hang out - at night, alone, usually watching a movie or something.  I'm slowly escalating things a little bit, nothing much, just touching over clothes. She doesn't give any indication that she's not into it, and she seems into it, but it never goes further than that for the night.  Pretty normal, totally fine, not very interesting story, right?

Well in both cases the girls get extremely upset.  With the first girl I keep trying to get in contact, because everything seems totally fine, but she's completely ignoring me.  When she finally gets in contact she says how she's really upset and tells me to never contact her again because every time I do she has a panic attack.  And so because of that, with the other girl I was careful to ask if it was okay before I did anything, and said to tell me if there was anything she didn't like.  And then I find out afterwards that she was extremely uncomfortable, and hated it and wanted me to stop and she was only going along with it because I wanted to, etc.  And in both cases it seemed SO fucking mild and not a big deal at the time and I was so careful to gauge her reactions and not push things, and in both cases somehow I completely missed everything I guess.  And now I feel like some disgusting rapist even though it literally never even escalated to kissing, let alone sex.

And yes, admittedly both of these girls weren't exactly the pinnacle of mental health.  I know both of them happened to be on a bunch of pills and seeing therapists, etc.  BUT STILL, it's situations like that which make me feel like I'm totally missing something and have no idea how to approach things.  I mean, maybe its not a big deal, but when that's your very first introduction to sexuality and both times the girl acts like you're a disgusting rapist who took advantage of them, of course you're going ro second guess your judgement.  Fuck, that still upsets me all these years later..."

329,"A girl made me a mix tape in highschool. It was a bunch of romancy j-beibs and t-swift songs. And wrote me a love letter. 

This was a while after I had rejected her. It was really sweet and all, and literally the only 'romantic' thing anyone has ever done for me, but it was more of a ""god fucking damnit I thought we talked about this"" kind of thing.

All the other girls I've dated have been categorically selfish and incapable of being decent to me. "
330,"Careful there, you just posted on Reddit that your wife won't do everything you want to do sexually, so be prepared for people to tell you that you need to get a divorce."
331,"My advice... 

Be on your absolute top level prince charming game.

Be super loving, and super supportive. Do everything you can to support her through her abortion. If she brings up the idea of keeping it, don't get upset, don't get angry, just gently reinforce the idea that it is not the right time, that you want to have a good future with her, and you would absolutely love to have a child with her, just not right now.

Make sure that she gets that abortion, then dump her irresponsible ass, and never speak to her again. Congratulate yourself for the giant bullet you just dodged."
332,"Remember, half the time the difference between a creep and someone trying his hardest to win over a girl is if she finds him attractive"
333,Yeah. Plus I don't really get why the twins factor makes it hotter. But I guess if pornhub has taught me anything it's that incest is apparently all the rage. 
334,"Really, I think that sub has no overlap with the women I've met in real life. Which is, for the most part, good."
335,"Implant the idea without asking. Watch a movie together where it happens and make sure she knows you thought it was hot. Tease her indirectly. Make sure she knows you'd like it, just so the idea is there - and then she'll decide on her own if she wants to do it or not."

Edit: So I appreciate the replies I'm getting, but I think my decision is clear. I'm just going to have another foursome, and then murder one of them so it becomes a threesome. Seems reasonable IMO "
345,Sounds like a lot of dick punching waiting to happen.
346,"Went on my first date when I was 22 to see if my lack of interest was a matter of ""you can't miss what you've never had"". The date was okay - friendly but awkward. Found out through a mutual friend later that my date had some scathing things to say about me. 

Decided that unless I actually develop a need to be with someone, I'm just not going to pursue anything. Been pretty content since. "
347,Do you really know them though? Anonymity let's one let their hair down far easier. Why would any man you actually know let you get close enough to see how they might actually feel knowing full well that confidence in men is everything.

Something will happen, and we'll start heatedly talking, she'll raise her voice to talk over me, which causes me to raise my voice to speak over her.One of us will point out the other is shouting and it'll devolve into bickering over who was shouting over who first. "
357,Everyone will end up with different experiences but it was interestingly around the time that I stopped giving a fuck about pursuing a relationship that I actually happened upon someone who was into me that I found attractive as well. Not really sure what kind of advice I should squeeze from my limited experience though.

365,"When my boyfriend and I were on our second date, we were joking around and he suddenly pulled me in for a cuddle. I was surprised, but I made myself comfortable. And he looked at me with his big beautiful eyes, like he wanted to kiss me but didn't want to push it. So instead of waiting, I kissed him, gentle. And then a lot harder. And we didn't stop kissing for a couple of hours.

Next time we made out, his hands were gripping my shirt and shoulders and touching everything except my breasts or my ass. So when his hand sort of hovered over my chest, I grabbed it and pushed it to me. He moaned and it was so hot.

369,"Still, it was very uncalled for when you chocked those kids wheels and told them sitters are quitters"
370,"Or if you do forget, you fucking tell someone so this doesn't happen in the first place.

It's called personal responsibility. She lacked it. It's one thing to forget, and not fuck for a bit, or get a pack of rubbers, it's another entirely to throw caution to the wind and just assume that you wan't be mad. Fuck, if she would have told you in the first place, you may have gained more trust for her."
371,"Absolutely. There is a sub called /r/askwomenadvice that pretty much grew out of the fact that you're not allowed to ask for advice on a personal situation on AW. The mods on there are nowhere near as intense, and it's a pretty good sub. And 2x is a good sub too (although it has gotten a bit harder since becoming a default). So I don't think there's something about the topic, it's something about the mods."
372,That was his point 
373,"Stuff about my appearance. I have dwarfism (which may or may not be a big factor in my lack of dating). She said (to our mutual friend, not intended for my ears) that it felt like she was ""with a child"" and that my ""tiny hands"" freaked her out. Which is fair enough, she has no obligation to find me attractive, and most people would probably find me unattractive for those reasons. But it did hit home that going dates would open me up to be critiqued and analysed in this new superficial way that I wasn't used to. My appearance was suddenly a very important factor with these new interactions. 

Can't say I was a fan of that prospect. I would deal with it if I actually felt the need to date, have sex, or be in a relationship - but I don't. So I'm good. "

379,"Is it really late?

[This study of teens aged 13-17](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/01/basics-of-teen-romantic-relationships/) says that 64% of them have never been in a relationship. In the 15-17 age group, 66% have *no* dating experience at all. And only 24% are currently in a relationship, too (18% being serious).

That's not quite the largest age range, as I'm struggling to find better, reputable numbers that aren't anecdotes. But this *at least* implies that the majority of people aren't dating till at least 18+. Very possibly it's actually 20+ or the like. And 18+ is a big difference from the 15+ that you claim.

TL;DR: No, most people do not start dating at 15."
380,And this is crazy
381,"Funny enough, when I use cute, it's not that it's a bigger compliment, just different. I'm kind of specific on my word usage. For example:

""Hot"": Purely physical attractiveness is being complimented. If I call a girl hot, I'm only talking about how she looks.

""Sexy"": Sexuality in her personality. This is where you have the sultry voice, the sensual touches, that look in her eye, the way she flirts and interacts with you that's just intoxicating. 

In the case of cute, it means I find this person/thing/etc. adorable, something that probably makes my insides flutter a little. It's not *always* used romantically, but it can be.

(That said, beautiful is the biggest compliment for me to give, but also the rarest because I'm so damn stingy on who or what I call beautiful. :P)"
382,"The other sub caters to the kind of women who are obsessed with language and diction. Thus why so many of them stick around, because the mods also have a hard-on for making sure everyone is sufficiently boring or neutral (or inflamed, but about the right topics. 

Meanwhile, this sub has much much less ""carve my name into his leather seats"" type of men. They are here, they are present, but they aren't shunned. They are accepted as a voice within a greater pool of voices.

The fact that mods barely do anything here, and the sub not being a toxic circle jerk for it, says how awesome this sub is! 

Welcome girls!"
383,"Same. Like, how much weight do I put down? or am I actually just hovering? Which way do I face? Is he looking up just seeing my tummy pooch and double chin and up my nostrils? If I face the other way, my ass would cover his entire head, that cant be sexy, a butt cheek resting in each eye. "

388,"I touched dicks with another guy when I was 10 or so.

Around that same time I also had another kid try to put his dong up my hole (don't ask me how we got that idea, I still don't know). Didn't work, his dick was too short then.

423,"Approaching them in less than ideal ways. There's no consensus among women, except that they pretty much never do the approaching. So you have a bunch of guys trying to guess what the rulebook is when not only does every woman have a different rulebook, but guessing the rules wrong makes you a loser or a creep.

Obviously there are extremes where guys should know better, but there's a huge middle ground where a guy is trying to be respectful but comes across as shy/lame or he's trying to take initiative and totally misinterprets the cues. They're not necessarily bad guys, but I don't think a lot of women understand how unclear the rules on the ""right"" approach are.  

Edit: and I don't mean pickups like in a bar or whatever, I mean generally. Bars are always tricky and guys pretty much have to accept they're bothering most people they approach. I mean like if you think you're hitting it off with someone and aren't sure how to escalate or whatever.
