1) Show up with your head held high.

2) Have an adult conversation.

3) It's OK to show some emotion, but don't lose it.

4) Say your goodbyes, go home, cry in the shower to a sad song."
1,"Free country. I'm allowed to say ""no fat chicks""."
2,They only want a big dick? That's fine. Belittling men who don't meet their standards? Well that's just scummy. It's like a guy making fun of a woman for having small tits. Basically it's not cool to criticize people for parts of their bodies they have no control over.
3,"For the women on this thread who now have no idea what to put, here's how you get the best guys to start a genuine connection: 

4-5 photos, one face selfie, one full-body selfie, 2-3 photos of you doing something worth talking about (hobbies, funny stories, events, travel, your kids...anything that shows that you don't scroll away your time on your phone)

List your stats. Age, height, hair colour, current employment, and lifestyle. ""30, 5'5"", fit, brunette, freelance researcher, condo owner who drives a p.o.s. Honda.""

Blast a list of things you would like to talk about. ""Message me about: Blue Jays. Poutine. Deadlifts. Cute coffee shops. Kittens falling over. Graffiti artists. Hiking trails. Distilleries. Volleyball. Striped socks. Pottery/soap making. Bob's Burgers. Archer. Indie punk bands. Skinny dipping. Hard cider."" 

Then, ""Looking to meet a great guy :)"" or ""Hoping for a fun date!""... or something else that fits your goals.

That's it. 4-5 photo, stats, topic starters, closing statement. Don't pre-screen guys (despite how many messages you get) - saying that only 6'+ guys should talk to you will deter the really great 6'+ guys from talking to you. Avoid describing how you see yourself (chill, loves to travel, laughs a lot, etc) - so many women suck at judging themselves that we end up with threads like this, and we're smart enough to judge for ourselves.

Then you'll get messages - check their profile and screen them then. If you like him, then make a small effort to keep a conversation going. That alone will put you above 95% of women on dating sites. Answer his question with enough detail to warrant follow ups and ask your own (keep two topics running if you can, so conversations never end with ""haha that's true!"" - they can continue with the second topic). Then fall in love, get married, invite me to the wedding. 

This requires a bit more time/effort (you'll have to read their profiles, etc), but it's still a fraction of the time that men typically put in to just starting a decent conversation.

E: Gold again?! Thanks! ...but that means it's time for me to go outside and get a life haha"

My best response to that was ""I think she doesn't get as wet now that it's not a mortal sin."""
6,"I'm only 24, but I quit my job, sold my shit, and went overseas about a year ago. What I can tell you for sure is that changing your environment doesn't necessarily change who you are or what's going on in your head. If you've got something in your mind that you need to get figured out, you have to deal with it, changing the scenery isn't just going to make that problem disappear.

A lot of people have this fantasy where they run away to a new place and suddenly they're a whole new person. It's just not true. You can go anywhere on earth, you're still just you in that place."

8,"- Appoint someone who can run interference for you who knows what your plan is and can make inconsequential decisions about inevitable deviations from it. You don't want someone who lost their invitation bothering the bride about directions to the ceremony. Make your sidekick handle it.

- Something will go wrong.  Accept that. But no one knows what exactly is supposed to happen anyway. If you roll with it, nothing is ruined. 

- Make sure you eat something. Both of you. Half those bridezilla stories you hear are laid back people who got an overdose of stress and a day full of low blood sugar. We ordered sub sandwiches with no dressing and no condiments (so we don't drip anything on ourselves) delivered in early afternoon.

12,"Definitely. My work is not computer based (landscape installation) but I spend way too much fucking time on reddit. Can't go an hour without looking at it. I don't even get anything out of it anymore.

There was a bestof post about social media addiction a while back. The person talked about how it keeps us refreshing the page by having a reward system such that you don't know when you'll find something interesting but occasionally you do. Imagine a rat pressing a lever that intermittently gives it drugs. It'll dispense the drugs after anywhere between one and one hundred presses. The rat doesn't know when the reward will come so it just keeps pressing and pressing and pressing. That's how i feel. 

And even when I'm not at a screen I'm usually listening to an audiobook or music. I do cross stitching for a couple hours every night, but even with that i can't just quiet my mind and do it, i have this need to be constantly entertained and stimulated. I could be doing worse things than listening to a book while making crafts, but still. 

I am totally addicted to the Internet and i hate it. A while back i found myself looking for an Internet addiction subreddit. Then it dawned on me how ironic that was. "

26,"I've seen quite a few boobs and been to quite a few topless beaches. It all depends on context to me. If I'm in a sexually arousing situation and I see tits, they turn me on. If not, and if I'm at the beach, seeing someone breastfeed or just changing a shirt, then I'm not typically aroused. "
27,"When I was around 17 or 18 me and a couple friends were sitting around together. It was me, two guy friends, and a female friend. I have no idea why we were taking about it but somehow penis size got brought up. I think the gay guy might've brought it up I'm not sure. 



Anyway, she says something along the lines of ""I mean I'm not picky, I just would want a guy to have a normal sized dick, you know?""


Me and the other guys look at each other with mild amusement. Straight dude asks her ""What do you think is a normal sized dick?"" She responds with a totally straight face ""IDK like 8 or 9 inches.""


All 3 of us dudes just busted out laughing. One friend said ""If you think that's normal sized you're gonna be very disappointed"" After I've composed myself a bit I ask her to show me what she thinks 8 or 9 inches looks like. She holds up her hands and goes ""IDK like this or so??"" and shows us roughly 5 or 6 inches tops. Queue the second burst of laughter. 


Since then I've sort of done some experimenting with it. Turns out a lot of girls have no idea what the size of the penis they're looking at is, but assume it's bigger than it really is when in reality it's pretty damn normal. "

37,I read a story on here once about a girl who conditioned her SO by putting her hair up every time they had sex. Iirc she did it for like two months straight and then put her hair up at a family dinner or something like that and watched him go crazy the whole night... Beware my friend.

39,"Grew up in a nudist colony 'till I was 21.

It depends entirely on how the girl is displaying them.  

As early teenagers we used to leave all the nude girls we were swimming with to sneak into a shack where we knew there were playboys.  There is a massive difference between a woman just being topless and a woman who is showing her boobs to you.

When non-nudist friends came up they were stunned at how quickly the ""sexiness"" of the nudity wears off.  It's less than half an hour.  Then it's just back to seeing them as people again.

**Edit**: Lots of questions about erections.  They just don't seem to happen.  Obviously there are things that some girls do to specifically provoke them.  But it's really all about context.  You get an unexpected boner **much** easier with clothes on than without.

Male friends who came up were explicitly worried about this.  But they were all fine.  Except for one guy who's girlfriend would ""accidentally"" stroke him on the way past.  He solved this problem by unexpectedly jumping into the pool.

**Another edit**: several people have suggested an AMA.  I just don't think people would find it that interesting. After the first two questions and people realise it's more like a caravan park than Caligula's Jungle Palace, everyone would get bored.

There are a few fun stories, but everyone has those. But thanks for the suggestion.  It's nice to be thought of as more interesting than you actually are."

We realize that sometimes only one of us might be in the mood.  It is not hard to give it up for the one you love, and you usually end up in the mood along the way... We respect each other.

Also, if you want to be cool and take some pressure off, figure out who you might need to tip. Put those tips in envelopes, and label then who they go to. Give those to your best man and have him give them to the appropriate people at the appropriate times. This is assuming you have a best man and can trust him with... anything. Also, he can get the marriage license, make sure it is signed and store it for you. Also on that point, the marriage license/paperwork needs to be sent out within' a couple of days, so have an envelope ready and if you are leaving for your honeymoon right away, have your best man make sure to mail it!

53,"&gt;How do you flirt/create sexual tension? 

Girls like it when you fondle their . . . minds. 

There are two parts to sexual tension: 

* Build-up: flirting, foreplay, etc.

* Release: sex.

Where some guys go wrong is trying to skip from build-up to release. This usually fails.

I think it's because women need to feel desired to have sex. While guys need to have sex to feel desired. Obviously, those are broad generalizations and won't apply to everyone.

There's a saying that men are like microwaves and women are like ovens. Men get horny fast and it's over fast. Women are slower to heat up but last longer.

What I've found works best when flirting in a relationship is to consistently keep your girl at a simmer, so she's always more open to the idea of sexy times. 

You might tap into her lust that day, you might not. You have that luxury to choose. Sometimes it builds up so much passion that she has to jump on you instead.

Her mind is a major erogenous zone. Words, metaphors and imagery can be a huge turn-on. Language and hints are her porn.

Ideas:

* Physical affection and touching.

* Flirting and teasing. Talk, phone calls, text. 

* Do romantic things for her--*outside* of normal holidays. Big gestures can come off as desperate and needy. I've found little things can be deadly effective, e.g. cute post-it notes, a pack of her favorite snack on her desk at work, etc. 

* Hot tip: if you know when she's on her period or going through tough times and do something nice for her unexpectedly (like when you're not there with her), it's 10x more powerful. Thoughtfulness trumps the amount of money spent. 

Women seem to love little pleasant surprises and variety. Don't do it all the time to the point you drown her in affection and kill the effect; enough to get her excited once in a while and keep her on her toes.

The key is to *don't do these things only when you want sex that day*. Women figure that out fast and feel manipulated. That's when they start to get suspicious and resentful whenever you do something nice for them, because they think a request for sex is coming.

The foreplay started with that compliment you gave her on the hot new dress she bought last week. Foreplay is an ongoing process. On the flip side, maybe she's denying sex now because you argued with her mother six months ago.

Easier to flirt all the time, but not escalate to sex every time. Make it a lottery, not an ATM transaction. Random, unpredictable payoffs are addictive.

Don't spend 100 percent of your time with her. You have work, hobbies and friends, a well-rounded life. Give her the gift of missing you. Ideally, she should be drowning in sexy anticipation, wondering when you're going up and ravish her. 

If it's a new relationship and you've hooked up with her a few times: when you're out of bed, remind her of a specific detail. Something she would associate with sexy times. A special naughty secret only you two would know. Make it a secret game for only the two of you.

I did this accidentally the first few times by being flirty and goofy and just trying to make things fun. Eventually I caught on to the effect it had on girls. 

For example, there was a girl who liked to tie her hair back before we would get down to it. Sometimes, I'd hold her long hair in my hand instead.

* One time, she was washing her face. I saw some hairs straying, so I helpfully swept back some of her hair and gripped it in my hand. She shivered a little and immediately gave me *that* look. That was by accident, before I realized it was a turn-on. It was like Pavlovian conditioning, where she associated the feeling of her hair in my hand with intimacy.

* She texted me she was coming over. I jokingly texted her back: ""Bring a hair strap."" Then I went back to watching TV and promptly forgot about it. She told me later that drove her wild. She couldn't drive fast enough.

* At a boring party, I whispered in her ear: ""Let's get out of here and go somewhere you can put your hair up for me."" She grabbed my hand and pulled me along.

* If you're feeling daring and risque, reference that sexy thing with innocent-sounding language when you're both among other people. ""Ah yes, my girlfriend always has the prettiest hair straps,"" you say, while giving her a knowing, naughty look. Warning: some girls are horrified by this. Others get embarrassed but also crazy turned-on and will act on it with you later in private. 

* Send her a flirty reference just when she's arrived at work. Girls *hate* it that they're all turned on but stuck at work thinking about doing it all day long. Let her lust build. Sexual tension builds precisely when it cannot be released. Brace yourself to get pounced on when she gets home. I once texted her a picture of a hair strap in my hand. No message.

Mix it up: spoken, written, visual, little actions. Feel free to get creative. 

Let her get turned on and writhe in anticipation because she doesn't know when you'll make your move. It's okay to drive her crazy this way. She secretly desires that sweet torture. It's not manipulation; you're creating an experience for her.

Other examples:

* One girl had this set of high-heeled shoes she always wore when she wanted to seduce me. If she came over wearing those shoes, you knew it was on.

* One girl liked to put on certain songs or singers when she was in the mood.

* One girl would spray on this special perfume if she was feeling up for it that night.

Every girl has her ""hair strap."" What's your girl's?

Remember it. Remind her of it. Have fun.

This is a mind shift, but experiment with treating your mission as your SO and your SO as your mistress. I think some women like that they don't have to bear the burden of being your world, your everything. 

She's the fun escape from work; she's the sexy distraction that pulls you away from time to time. Helps to keep up the flirty vibe.

Hope this helps."

I put them on and he's waiting for me at the front. Escorts me to our private dinner on the third floor balcony. Our private chef comes out and asks us what we like then whips up course after course. Then the fireworks start going off and we have a perfect view. He asks me if the fireworks were pretty ( I was mesmerized by them) and I look over to him on his knee with a gorgeous ring. I of course say yes and I hear clapping. His entire family was there and took pictures of it all . He invited my family too but they didn't come (but that's another story for another time). The chef brought out a dessert that says congratulations and we come back to the room to wine from the hotel and a fuck ton of gifts as well. I'll never forget that night. :)

Probably one with a waterslide and a wave pool, and a better concession stand. This metaphor sort of got away from me. "

93,"My wife (married 3 years - late 20s) has bad anxiety, and I have absolutely none. Even though it's impossible for me to relate to her feelings of anxiety, we've slowly learned to make things work. I'm not a professional in this area but I'll share what seems to work for us. 

I've stopped trying to ""fix it"". You can't reason with it (the anxiety, not the girl), and trying to do so generally only creates frustration for both of you. Just be compassionate and offer to help however you can. 

You may be incredibly frustrated sometimes. It'll ruin nights you've planned together, weekends away, vacations, holidays, etc, but it's so important to remember that it's not a choice for her. She's frustrated too. Try not to take it out on each other. 

She goes to therapy once or twice a month. There are affordable options for this, even without great insurance. I think it helps. Like I said, I'm not a pro so it makes us both feel better that there's a professional involved.

She has anxiety medicine in her purse. In the 4 or 5 years since it got bad, she's only taken it once. She's terrified of becoming addicted, or changing her personality, etc. But I've noticed a big difference since she got the prescription. Just knowing that there's something that can calm her down makes her feel better when things start going off the rails.

Being tired drains the desire to do many things and it took me some time to realize that when my wife got a chance to do things, she did what she missed the most, which wasn't necessarily having sex.  

It's like many things in life that ebb and flow. Now that the kids are older we've returned to regular sex. Through the years we have become more adventurous and are at a point where we can be completely open with each other. She claims to not have any fantasies (though I've told her if she does, almost nothing she shared would put me off), but she's indulged several of mine. We've reached levels of comfort and confidence in each other that have notably improved our life together. Also, once I had a vasectomy we ditched the condoms and that improved sex notably. "

So frustrating. /rant"
115,"Very. Which is a reason why many men who have open access to sex still masturbate. I know I do. I could be having sex in two hours today, doesn't mean I didn't crank one out earlier today. 

Masturbation is something I do for me. It's relaxing, I know what I like, and I can take as long or short as I feel like it. 

Sex is a two person activity. You are constantly aware of a second person being involved. You can't just do what you like, you have to add things you may not enjoy as much and some things you do you can't do every time. It's also very intimate, you are literally inside another person. 
During sex you're also dealing with a much higher amount of limbs. Masturbating involves my hand, on special days a finger up my ass, but that's it. During sex you're battling an epic fight with 4 arms, 4 legs, 4 hands, 4 feet. It tends to get much more... clumsy. During masturbation you move one hand up and down for a while, the other's on the mouse, it's about as low effort as it gets. 

Sex is also *exhausting*. It's honestly the only reason I keep in decent shape, because I want to be able to perform well, and I used to be fucking out of breath after 5 minutes of missionary. As a man, there's a good chance you're usually doing the brunt of the labour involved. I like equivocating sex to exercise. Masturbation is doing a couple situps and pushups at home. It'll leave you a little sweaty and a bit tired. Sex is more like sparring in a boxing ring for half an hour. You're using most of your body and if you're not in good shape, you're going to be tired and feeling your entire body ache afterwards.

But on the purely physical side? A vagina has a much different texture from your hand. Depends a bit on if you're using a condom or not (kids, use a condom), though. But the closest on hand comparison is the inside of your cheek. Feel that versus your hand, it's much different.

I don't own a DVD player or a CD player or any clunky electronics beyond a couple small amps, speakers and a big screen.   My car isn't cluttered with static maps and gigantic folders of CDs that have to be swapped every hour.  I don't have to go to the fucking library to look up minor trivia.  When I need to work on my car, I don't have to dig through a 2,000 page repair manual.  I don't have a walkman or a portable video game thingus.

Be careful to not fall into the trap I did.  My brother and I went out to get lunch a few hours before heading to the wedding location.  The restaurant was the type where you order at the counter, and they bring the food to you at your table.  It was pretty packed at the time, so my brother told me to order him XYZ and he would go grab one of the last remaining tables.  Okay, that works.

A general inability to take “no” for an answer.

Performing mental backflips in order to rationalize bad decision making in hindsight.

Being ""proud"" of their inability to handle basic food preparation or lack of domestic skills.

Wondering why they feel like shit all the time when their diet consists of mostly Cliff bars, flavored vodka, and Vitamin Water.

A lack of self discipline.

A preoccupation with what celebrities are doing with their lives."

213,"As a 5'9'' dude, I agree with those other people. You're presenting it as a double standard, but it's not quite there. Women can change their BMI. It's very rare for guys to grow 6'' taller. 

The way I see it, my future wife might be overweight now - but I could be extremely attracted to her physically in 6 months. Meanwhile, a girl who likes tall men will almost certainly never mind that aspect of me attractive. "

215,"Part of what helped me stop using Reddit as much - aside from when I'm at work - was to think to myself, ""What would I have missed if I didn't use Reddit 4 hours today that I wouldn't have experienced in 1 hour?""

99% of the time the answer was, ""Nothing.""

Then I asked myself, ""How much do I gain for real world use when I use Reddit?""

99% of the time the answer was, ""Nothing.""

If you're having a really hard time my advice is to get a weekend camping trip going. The first day it'll be a bit hard, but by day two there's a chance you won't miss the internet. That helps me reset my brain and realize how unimportant Reddit is. I only use it almost entirely when there's downtime at work now."
216,"I hope I'm not too late, but I chased and caught a pig once. As a police intern. 



I was on my second internship with my hometown's police department. The department was fairly small in an equally small town. The town had about 11,000 people and was in the rural Midwest. There were usually 3 or 4 officers working, and I rode with whoever was going somewhere interesting and just helped out with whatever I could. 



In the middle of some hot, sticky summer day, we were all sitting around in the squad room. I was playing on my phone, the officers were on their computers working on reports. There was a baseball game on I think. The dispatcher called back to us and said there was a pig on the loose near the park. This sounded hilarious, so we all piled into cars and went to go find it. 



We got into the neighborhood where the pig had last been spotted and split up. The guy I was with said that there was an abandoned house that used to have a bunch of animals in the backyard, so we checked there first. We pulled into the alley behind this house and another officer joined us. The yard was full of shitty wood chicken coops and makeshift pigsties and was overgrown with tall grass and weeds. We tramped through it looking for the pig, but didn't see it anywhere. We headed back to the cars. We made it about a block away from the abandoned house when the other officer from the yard radioed us: ""Hey....so, uh..check your clothes. I found some fleas on me from that yard.""



The officer and I both look down and there are fleas crawling all over our legs. He slams on the brakes and we jump out of the car smacking fleas off of ourselves. It basically looked like the scene from Tommy Boy when they jump out of the car pretending to be attacked by bees. When we finally stopped this and looked around, we noticed two big burly redneck types with Duck Dynasty-looking beards sitting on the porch of the house we had stopped in front of. One takes a swig from his can of Natty Light and goes ""Ya'll lookin for a pig?""

""Yes sir, we are. Have you seen one?""


""S'over there"" says the redneck man, taking another drink and pointing to another alley. In the alley is this little pig, just doing pig things. We radio the other officers for backup. What happened next involved a slow-speed pursuit of the pig through this neighborhood. Two officers were on foot while a third officer and I drove cars and attempted to box the pig in. Eventually, we penned the pig in up against a garage and fence in some old lady's driveway. We completed the blockade with the two patrol cars, Dukes of Hazarded it across the hoods (more or less), and then stopped. Nobody want to grab the pig. It was making angry pig noises and seemed pretty fast. 

""Intern!"" one of the cops yelled, ""Grab that pig!"" 



Without thinking, I lunge at the pig and scoop it up in my arms. Angry pig noises intensify. It's kicking and squirming and squeeling and getting all kinds of pissed, so I yell ""What do I do now??""


""Uhhhhh.....quick! Throw it in this trash can!""

He wheels over a hot pink trash can and throws open the lid. I dunk the pig in there and we slam the lid shut. The whole time, a weird redneck lady was standing in the yard next to us cackling and yelling ""Pigs chasin pigs!"" 

She eventually came over and asked us to pose with the pig for a picture, which we did. I wish I knew who she was or if she still had that picture. 


We had no idea what to do, so we called the sergeant. He called somebody with the city, who brought over a pickup truck with a liftgate on it. The plan was to take the pig to the county dog pound and leave it in a cage until the owner could be found. Unfortunately, there was nobody at the pound that late in the day, someone needed to ride in the back of the truck to make sure the pig-can didn't tip over, and it had started to pour rain. Being the intern, I got to ride in the pouring rain, sitting on the side of the truck bed and holding the trash can steady while we drove across town to the pound in what must have been a very strange looking convoy. 

We ended up leaving the pig in one of the empty cages. The sergeant left a note on the door that essentially said ""There is a pig in this cage, contact the police department"".

217,"When she has her kids in her dating profile pics that shows me she's more concerned about find ""new Daddy"" than trying to build a relationship with me.

When all her pictures are just selfies of herself I get the feeling she doesn't really have friends which means she could end up being incredibly codependent.

220,"It wasn't like a separate town.

It was more like a large, walled (10ft) caravan park on expansive grounds.  Some people had tents, others caravans and the rest houses.  Some people lived there permanently, others only came up in summer or on weekends.

There were about 200 people there in the summer months.

You turned up, unlocked the gates and drove in.  It had lawns, a shower block (with inside and outside showers), an in ground trampoline, kids playground (taken over by the teenagers at nightfall), tennis courts, volleyball court, running track.

Actually it was more like a country club.

People would carry towels on their shoulders.  Because when you went and visited your friends in their homes, it was considered polite to sit on your own towel.

Apart from everyone being nude, it was like a friendly village.  The same social norms applied.  You don't stare or make anybody uncomfortable.  There are married couples, families, singles.

But there was very little conflict.  And only two physical scuffles that I knew of (both involving me, and both minor).  It was a very safe place.  Families would show up on friday night, the kids would immediately run off with their friends (only returning home for *some* meals), and leave on sunday night.

The longest I stayed for any continuous time was 3 months.  It was over the summer holidays and we had the Australian Nudist Convention at our colony.  It was one of the best memories of my life.  I was 16.  The usual 15 teenagers grew to about 40.  We had a teenager tent city.  Boundaries were tested in the most delightful ways.  Some of us got in trouble (but not too much).  One day while taking part in a teen car wash to raise money for a youth project, I found myself in a mud wrestle with the most stunning girl from Melbourne.  We were ordered away and told to clean ourselves up.  So we ended up in a shower together too.  We wrote for only a few weeks afterwards.  But it is a fantastic memory.

If you have a chance to try one out, I highly recommend it."
221,"It's not that people don't appreciate that, it's that *everyone* appreciates it. ""Wine and Netflix"" is basically saying ""some times I like to chill"" which is not really information worth a damn.

I get high and watch nature documentaries with my friends on mute, and we do sound effects and voices with our choice of music in the background. That's kind of interesting, right? ""I get high and watch Netflix"" isn't."
222,"* won't use condoms

* she's not on birth control 

So... Sounds like your girlfriend is really dumb or wants a baby. Or maybe both! Which camp are you in, being dumb or wanting a baby? 

I mean, I assume you're one or the other. 

What you do: Tell her you don't want to risk pregnancy. Offer to go with her to a clinic to get her on the pill and get joint STD testing while you're at it to be safe. Even if she gets on the pill, pull out because she's proven herself to be rather dumb (see above) and I wouldn't expect her to take it on time. Ideally you would use condoms *and* have her on the pill until you're both in a position to be able to handle a potential pregnancy. "

But just the way you typed this up, it's pretty damn clear where your heart is and I think you should follow it.

And if Spain and/or Helen turns out to not be what you're looking for, then pivot and use it as a springboard for more discovery (internal and external).

Seems like putting that in your freaking dating profile is the same as holding up a sign saying ""You will always come second in terms of my life priorities. No matter how great of a guy you are, you will always take a backseat to my children."" 

Granted that's the way it should be (one's children &gt; random guy you're dating) but why would anyone voluntarily sign up to date a person like that?"
251,"Speaking as the wife in the situation, hell yes my husband actively taking part in our shared lives makes him more attractive. I have friends whose husbands are just another human she has to take care of and believe me, it breeds resentment and disrespect. Definitely not lust.

254,"Here, I actually made the mistake of posting a full constructive criticism guide on facebook pertaining to tinder, but applicable to other dating apps/sites.  People took it personal and thought I was a douchebag for a couple days, but since we're anonymous here, I can be honest with you.  Here we go!

- Do not make your first picture a group photo (and for the love of God don't make every picture a group photo.) You will be assumed to be the least attractive one.

- Do not make your first pic one where you're with another guy (unless you're *specifically* looking for a threesome). I know you think that we will think ""other guys like her, so she must be attractive."" What we actually think is ""she has competition, and that will be a pain in the ass; might as well go for one with less competition."" Of course, it's all subconscious, but that's the gist of our thought process.

- Have at least one picture where your full body figure is visible. A bunch of face close ups and high angle shots makes us assume that you're overweight (I've been fooled by this technique; never again) or that you are uncomfortable with your body.

- If you are a single mother, make that clear in your profile. Most girls do this, and we appreciate the honesty even if we don't match with you.

- If you're not a single mother, don't post pics of you holding kids; we assume they are yours.

- Bonus points for activity pictures that are something other than going out for drinks.  It makes you seem more attractive as a person and gives us something to start a conversation on.

- The text in your profile doesn't matter much when we're swiping, but it gives us something to relate to when we send the first message.  Give us something to work with so we don't have to just copypaste a message or give a very bland, ""hey.""

- Don't put exclusionary criteria in your profile (e.g. only 6' and taller guys).  What would you think if you saw a guy's profile that said something like ""only girls 140 pounds or less""?  Even if you fit the criteria, you'd probably consider him a colossal asshole.  This goes both ways.

- Don't post all glamour or professional photographs.  We will assume you are a spam bot or scammer.  Due to the economics of dating, spam is targeted towards men on dating apps more than women.  When evaluating a match, we aren't just thinking, ""do I like her, what do I say, etc.""  We are also trying to discern whether or not you are a scammer, spambot, or catfish.

- Don't be afraid to message first.  I know that due to the economics of dating that if you're at least one standard deviation below average or higher in terms of physical attractiveness, you will be swamped in matches.  But if you see a guy you *really* like, don't be afraid to take the first step.  It's not ""desperate,"" it's refreshing.

P.S, if you have an inverse gender guide like this for males, please post it as a reply.  We would all greatly appreciate it."

It can be something you talk about, but not the only thing you talk about, or the thing you mostly talk about. Be happy and confident in what you do for fun. You would be surprised how much these ""nerdy"" interests can be a positive, or at least a neutral factor, with other women simply based on how confident you are in yourself when you do discuss it. It's the difference between being the guy who happens to like comic books, and the comic book nerd. You are more than Action Comics #1.

Secondly, and probably as important if not more important than that first bit, is to actually *be* more than ""comic book nerd."" Have other interests - other things to talk about. The whole betterment thing still applies to you, and probably more so. Try to be fit. Try to dress well by having clothes that fit and aren't just Green Lantern tees. Have a decent haircut. Smell good. Be clean and fairly tidy at home. There's that whole job thing. Have one. HAVE OTHER HOBBIES. I suggest something outdoorsy (you pasty little fucks!) like hiking. Even if you aren't really an outdoors guy, say you are (hah! lie! but follow through and make it your hobby). 

It's amazing how little these nerdy things matter when you're a confident, well kept fella who has more to talk about than that Boba Fett chillin' in its case. And honestly, there are girls who like that stuff too. Hot ones. I know a bunch. Show you're a person that likes these things and not the stereotype that usually defines them, and you'll start to see them pop up. "

Basically, you can't expect to get a girlfriend who will sort out your life for you.  You need to sort out your life for yourself first.  I'm still in that process.

If a girl like this has traveled, then she probably actually built her character doing it, and that's awesome."
311,"XHamster has recently taken a stand on rape or forced porn. Do a search for it and you'll receive no results and a suggestion that you seek help from a mental health professional.

This shaming of a very common kink has put a lot of folks in an uproar. A porn site deciding to suddenly become puritanical is just bad business. Besides, most of these videos have segments before and after the actual meat of the video that the ""raped"" subject making it abundantly clear that this is a simulation and that proper consent guidelines and safe word practices are being abided by.

Sexuality is vastly diverse, and sometimes the different things people get off to can alarm us. It is my belief that as long as everybody involved is mature enough, lucid/sober enough, and gives consent to what is going on, there is nothing wrong with what you are doing. What XHamster is doing right now is taking choice and agency away from the huge number of people who make the choice to participate in simulated forced sex."
312,I still haven't gotten my first period.
313,"I... kinda fall in the ""men don't cry"" camp.

Think about it this way. Women cry at the drop of a hat, as a matter of stereotype. If I see a woman crying, I assume there's something wrong.

But if I see a man crying, I assume something is *wrong*. There's a power that comes from rarity. If a man is crying it's because he reached a breaking point and he *needs* to let it out.

Death of family is a big one. Death of your dog is another. And sometimes life just throws you in the dirt, kicks you in the ribs, and pisses on you, and you gotta let a little out.

But if I see a man crying constantly, I don't assume good things.

TL;DR: Crying is okay. Crying all the time is not."

Fast forward to some time later and she has become a dom, found a sub, and open discusses their relationship/activity with our social group. It lasts for bit but eventually fizzles. 

Fast forward again about a year later at another group night out when the subject of dom/bdsm comes up and I remark ""Dom stuff doesn't really do it for me.

Somehow, I ended up in an investment banking job a few years later. Got married and along the way, we moved to Singapore and had two great kids.

I never for a moment thought that life would have been better had I stayed. I was too busy tackling new challenges to ever look back. The whole thing has been the adventure of a lifetime. In August, it will be 25 years. Probably the only regret I have is that time has gone by too quickly.

One day you're going to get a call that your mom or dad are dead.
One day you might lose a brother/sister.
You will lose friends. The longer you're alive the more people you will lose, and it never gets easy. 

Ex's are like allergies, they suck for a bit, but if you're proactive, you'll get over them. Use every relationship to learn and better yourself. 

This is nothing more than practice for what life will bring you. Too often you know what the phone call is about before you even pick up, and it doesn't hurt any less. 

Practice hardening that heart my friend.

Also, incest-play. Lily Rader has some amazingly hot videos in which she pretends to fuck her father and brother (and none of that 'step'-nonsense either). I never think of me and my family that way because that grosses me out, but it's the taboo element that gets me going."
357,"At least in the US, It is a result of the influences of labor organizations and production efficiency experts from the 1890s and early 1900s. 

Henry Ford had his labor force studied, and while implementing the production line for efficiency, he also cut the workweek down to [5 days/ 40 hours](http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-40-hour-workweek-2015-10).   

Railroad workers were regulated to an 8 hour day right around the same time.  

Of course, this change was already familiar with labor in Europe.   Labor was fighting for a [10-hour workday in England around 1810,  and workers in France got the 12-hour day during the 1848 revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day).   

If you think life is short today,  think of the triumph when the workday was reduced to 'only' 10 or 12 hours. 

Prior to this, there was no 'weekend'.   Sunday was 'the lord's day',  but the other 6 days were just days.   
The first [recorded use of 'weekend'](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/where-the-five-day-workweek-came-from/378870/) is reported to be around 1897...  where the rest period after work on Saturday, and the full day Sunday was considered a peaceful 'weekend'. 

*They also coined the term ""Saint Monday"" .. for those that were still hungover and couldn't come to work after the lord's day off. 

Choosing Saturday as the other day off was likely influenced by the Jewish celebration of the Sabbath.   That previous Atlantic link also says that the first Sat-Sun weekend was implemented at a mill in New England to accommodate workers of both faiths. 
[FastCompany](http://www.fastcompany.com/3035279/the-future-of-work/why-we-still-dont-have-a-four-day-workweek) points to the US Depression of the 1920s, when cutbacks across industries eliminated the 1/2 workday on Saturday to save wage expenses. 

FC also writes that [the 4 day week is already in effect in Netherlands, and in at least a few large US firms](http://www.fastcompany.com/3035279/the-future-of-work/why-we-still-dont-have-a-four-day-workweek).   There's still a lot of debate whether we should continue to work ~40 hours
in those 4 days, or stick with the observed efficiency of the 8-hour day.   

The way this stuff may change is to keep talking about it.  If your job has flex-hours or similar programs, ask for it.  Tell your Congressperson/Representative in your next letter that you want them to consider this moving forward.

Dunno how many other men feel that way, however, so take that with a grain of salt."
364,"Girl here. If you are looking for a girl who wants to date, or find a real relationship, then these are the things that I see in online profiles that raise flags for me:

Photos:
-only photos of you in a group of people, I have no idea which one you are. I like 1 or 2 group pics so I know you are a normal person who has friends, but only groups is overkill.

-photos of you in ridiculous costumes/clearly black out drunk/taking a beer bong/surrounded by women in bikinis You are trying to attract a date, not a frat bro. 

Profile:
-a laundry list of very specific things you aren't looking for. eg, ""no fatties, if you can't hold a conversation or hate books than we probably won't work out"" be positive- say you are looking for something long term/ something not too serious/ friendship/whatever, but specific details sound super douchey 

-there's nothing about yourself- or only one/two words about yourself- if it appears you aren't taking it seriously, then I'm not going to take you seriously. if I put the time and effort into a profile than you should too.

-every single profile (and I'm sure it's the same for women) talks about loving to travel, playing the guitar, and surfing (I'm in California). They may as well be templates. Be unique and tell me something fun and special about you. You write poetry, you compete is magic tournaments, whatever- be an individual among a sea of the same dude.

Messaging:
-don't send a message that you clearly copy/pasted to 20 other women. We know.

-If you don't ask a question, what am I supposed to respond to...? Saying 'hi' is nice, but it's not a great conversation starter. The best messages I've gotten refer to topics of interest in my profile. It's flattering to know guys paid attention, and are asking about my interests. ""Where's your favorite place to take your dog?"" "" what's your go-to wine bar?"" I list both loving wine tasting and my dog in my profile.

-don't get mad when I take a couple days to respond, or send me another message asking if I'm still around. Nobody wants to be badgered, and you certainly don't want a date out of pity.


Hopefully this helps! If you are genuine and honest and put the time and effort in it will show- and women will be able to tell.

Then you start into making the brownies, tell her a story that relates to baking, that reminds her of a story, and you're off. If things go quiet, tease her about her baking skills or ask her if those are her brownie baking earrings. 

Keep everything in and related to the moment you're in, enjoy being with the person and interacting with them.

390,"You come to understand that this ""syndrome"" is a manifestation of indecision. By constantly worrying about roads you didn't travel you give yourself permission to not commit fully to the road you are on.

The best way to get over it is to look at your life and the choices you have, decide which choices you want to take (or continue with), and then go at it 100%.

Give yourself permission to review these choices at least once per year, but choose, commit, and get to it.

I cannot recommend that anyone gets married at 22 (I did, divorced and whatnot later, oops) - but it is possible to come to peace with the idea that she's the last woman you are going to know in that manner. Three (or four) is enough for you to know that women are not all the same, and that you can enjoy the differences, but the only thing more exposure does is give you a clearer sense of what you do enjoy. 

If you enjoy what you have, bedding 20 other women will only validate that to the nth degree. You may learn a few things along the way, that's the perk of diversity, but at the end of the day if a sexual match is good, it's good for it's own reasons and more good matches won't invalidate that.

tl;dr though, look at your options, take the ones that'll give you a life you think you'd enjoy, and commit. Review annually and move along.

I have to admit, I'd not be a huge fan.

Long story longer, I realized that we can show empathy toward the people we love and really care about, even if we know there's no real reason for them to feel that way. We still lift at the gym, but home visits, out of respect for my wife, no longer happen.
