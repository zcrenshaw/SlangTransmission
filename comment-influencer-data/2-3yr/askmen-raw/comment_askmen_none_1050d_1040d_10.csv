0,"*Most* times when making the first move you will be rejected. That's just how it works. Welcome to the cold, uncaring world of having initiative. Keep trying until success."
1,"&gt; I try to sit in places where people may ""notice"" me, try not to look busy in hopes that someone will strike up a conversation,

What are you, a fucking mermaid? Get a hobby or something. At least at my uni there are groups for everything, boardgames/dnd, bouldring, skiing, volleyball, whatever. Try something - worst case scenario you wasted an hour on something you didn't really enjoy, but at least you talked to some people. Then try something else."
2,"I ran out in a Midwest thunderstorm to cover her up

Edit because I'm bored:

It started out as a gorgeous summer day. Enough cloud coverage for the occasional shade. The wind rustled for more relief on the hot, yet not sweltering day. It would be a travesty to have spent all day indoors all day. 

Leaving work, I flew down the interstate. My mind was with her in the backyard. With the windows down and radio blaring ""Peaches"" I headed to the grocery store to pick up corn and bratwurst. 

I burst through the front door touting my bounty. I strolled outside to find her. I ripped off he cover in ecstacy. 

Knowing how turn her on, I pushed her buttons just right. While waiting on her to warm up, I went inside and grabbed 2 beers--one for me and one for her to cool down. 

Eventually, she warmed up. She was ready. *SSSsss* exclaimed the bratwurst as I laid them upon the hot metal. The corn remained quiet as it sat in its aluminum bath of butter and salt. I held her handle and eased it down, leaving her to do her thing.

Grabbing another beer, a gust blew by as a shiver creeped up my arm. Odd for July, but I didn't think too much of it. I returned outside to my shady spot with a new brew in hand. 

On occasion, I'd check on her to make sure she didn't need a beer and rotating as need be. After 15 scentual minutes of my nose teasing my stomach, I opened her up one final time to receive her gifts. I let her cool off as I went inside to catch a game of sportsball and eat my meal.

Leaving my mind inside on my sportsball game, I never paid mind the the weather advisory. Half an hour passed while, oblivious to me, a storm swooped in like a sky whale chomping on krill. The satelite tv  signal cut out and I glanced outside. In my neglect, I gasped as I saw her cover, thrown aside. I couldn't bear the thought of betrayal, I opened the door to the torrential downpour, a wall of my transgressions.

Drenched after the first step, I sprinted to the cover. How could I let this happen? I left my grill out to ~~dry~~ cool off and was so wrapped up in my selfishness. I had neglected her after all she had done for me. I grabbed her cover, giving it a few shakes and threw it over her. Then and only then did I run back inside.

Thunder crackled as I closed the door. Could I have done this earlier? Would she forgive me? She was steaming angry. After a while, the steaming subsided; she had let it all out. She was dry and I was still soaked. I went in to change, relieved just to had covered her in time. 

Yet, I realized I had mitigated damagd. It was a mistake, but I had corrected it. The next time I grilled, she wouldn't suffer any rust or water damage. We could stay together longer and I could look forward to another day spent with my grill"
3,"I remember what it felt like.  

You wake up with this feeling that you can accomplish anything. Wherever you go, whatever you do, you feel powerful and capable. You don't give a shit about what others think of you, you stop overthinking for no reason, you just do it. You are at the right place at the right time every time, because you figure out a way to make every moment an opportunity. You feel all of this because somewhere in all this space and noise, you know there's this beautiful person that loves every detail of you, someone that accepts you for who you are, no matter what. You love her, she loves you, and that gives you incredible strength. That makes you live with ambition. That makes you live with so much confidence. You walk around like nothing can break you. 

I hope I can live it again, I wish you to live it too.

E: I'm really touched with all your replies and PMs... And thank you for giving gold to my comment... It was an honest comment. That's how I really felt when I was in love. I'm glad it resonated with so many of you and I hope it helped OP and others in the same situation. Love u all "

6,"We met on tinder and had been talking for a couple weeks. Things had progressed to sexting, so it was pretty clear where we were gonna end up. We met up at a bar, got a few drinks in us, and that's where the teasing  started. There was much grinding, not so subtle under the table groping, and she even went to the bathroom and sent me a few pictures. After a long while of this we headed out to her place and climbed in bed. 

Now at this point you'd think we just get right to it immediately, but no, we got down to our undies and she continued teasing me. There was a lot of making out and feeling each other up and dry humping, but every time I tried to progress further she'd stop me. Finally, after hours and hours, she starts to move downtown. I was pumped to finally be getting some, but she didn't go for my dick, she went for my balls. She spent probably 20 minutes just sucking on and licking my balls with no dick contact. 

Fiiiiinally she moved up and started going to town on my dick. I'm not talking just sucking on it, she was slobbering on it like she was dying of thirst and my dick contained the only water for miles around. She used her tongue, deepthroated right off the bat, and everything was very wet and slippery. It was fucking amazing. 

Now you need to understand that I'd had a hard on since basically when we met up at 9pm until this point (3 or 4am), so I came with more force than I ever had before and probably ever would in the future. I came so hard that I blacked out momentarily and my entire body got all tingly when I came to. And God bless her, she swallowed every last drop. 

And that's the story of my best oral sex experience. "
7,Straight up tell him. If he's a friend he'll know you're coming from a good place.
8,Why wait around for someone to approach you? People are there to finish school. It's not high school. If you want to meet someone you need to approach them too. Its not a one way street.

11,Depends on if you love them back. It doesn't feel great when a girl loves you and you have no way to reciprocate. 
12,"This is painful for me to admit, but speaking from experience -  if you've been dating someone from South Asia (specifically India/Pakistan/Bangladesh, can't really confirm if this is a thing at all for East Asian folks but I believe it could be a thing for Middle Easterners as well) and it's pretty much in a long term relationship but he hides you from his parents or keeps telling you ""soon"", it's *not bueno* - set down the fucking ultimatum ASAP or walk. It's painful, but this is something you need to make clear early on. 

I feel terrible about this, but I've encountered far too many women who were destroyed when their long term relationships with men from my country ended because the fella decided to placate his parents and marry the girl they chose from him than stick to his guns and fight for you (telling them to fuck off). A lot of dudes out there are also manipulative as fuck and do this because, you know, widespread belief that western women are easy, so they can have their fun until their parents find them a nice girl, in which case guess who gets dropped like a hot potato?

I'm pretty cool with my parents and they've been amazing in wanting to meet my girlfriends (which is definitely not the norm), but it's usually been me holding up because I want to make absolutely sure. 

It's absolutely disgusting when I've come across cases like this and do my best to warn them when I spot the signs (or when I talk to the guy and he seems like a slimeball), but sadly there's little one can do to make someone see that. "
13,"You look like you've got no follow-through. Starting out a conversation is great, but the dude is going to assume you're not interested if you have a strong start and then leave it to him to follow-through. "
14,"My partner became too dependent on me. We lost our individuality. I really think sexual attraction stems from this idea of ""separateness."" When you first start dating, that person is still ""other."" You find them mysterious, independent, etc. But eventually you melt together into an unsexy blob. We're really intimate ALL the time, but never erotic.

Trying to make it work currently. Trying to become two again, so we can enjoy becoming one.


EDIT: wow thank you for the gold. I'm extremely honored."
15,"I'm happy for you, but now I'm sad for me. "
16,This question is adorable.
17,"I was like 16 and she was 15. It was almost creepy she was so skilled. Instantly started deep throating (at 46 this has only been done by 2 other people). She went at it steady and just kept taking it all every single stroke while staring in my eyes. Made me cum in under a minute, and did not stop. Not once did I get overly sensitive or need a refractory period. Kept going. Ten minutes later she made me cum again and still kept going. Finally after 25-30 minutes she climbed on top and fucked me stupid for over an hour. It was almost creepy because I have no idea how a 15 yo had those kind of skills."
18,"You, as a female college student, will have a very high success rate with guys by just taking the initiative, saying hello, and giving a simple compliment.

Guys have the same anxiety when it comes to girls, and it's extremely rare for a girl to approach them and say hello, which will definitely make you stand out and always be remembered.

I was complimented exactly two times when I was in university. Guess what? I remember them and their words til this day. People who hardly receive compliments will never forget the few ones that they do receive.
"
19,"My grill is a bit of a cuck, so one time I let my buddy get dress up in a suit and cook a nice rib-eye on her. She came, we ate, good times were had. "
20,"That's what I was thinking. She says she's the one making the first move, but it looks more like she opens possibilities for guys to make the actual first move.

Maybe I'm wrong though, but I thought 'first move' implied the actual act of asking someone out."
21,"Lack of validation. I feel confident when it comes to things like my job and my hobbies because I can obtain measurable results like completing a task or finishing a project and people will tell me I did a good job or they like my work etc. 

Yet when it comes to dating I don't have a lot of confidence because I rarely receive any form of validation that women want me. I've lost count of how many times I've been rejected and I never been in a relationship for longer than two months so in my mind I've put two and two together and realised that the lack of a serious relationship in the past 10 years equals lack of desirability toward me and therefore I don't feel confident in the dating world. 

EDIT: Wow I didn't expect this comment to resonate so much and thank you to the kind person for the gold, much appreciated."
22,"* That we're all the same when it comes to relationships

* That we're fuckbois

* That we can't be trusted as parents to look after a child without the mother

* That we shouldn't cry because it diminishes us as a man."
23,"Reply to the email they sent you and say something along the lines of 

""I'm sorry, but there appears to have been a miscommunication between when my interview was scheduled and when I was told it was scheduled.  What time would you like to reschedule?""

Always initiate, don't wait for them.  Open up the conversation trying to avoid placing blame as much as possible.  If they try to blame you that's when you point out that the email you received clearly says ""Friday"".  Don't beg for the reschedule, or ask ""would you like to reschedule"".  Assume they will and ask them for the time. Make them tell you ""we will not be rescheduling"" before you start to actively defend your position."
24,Strip poker advantage?
25,"We did it on the first date. Towards the end of the dinner we were having at the restaurant, we were leaning towards each other for a rather personal subject matter in our conversation, so that others couldn't hear us. I used that as an opportunity to grab her hand for the next minute or so. Rather than show confusion, she reacted with a smile. We had hugged when we met for the date, but I was super anxious to break the touch barrier in an ""I really like you"" manner, and us leaning made me feel more confident, but still slightly nervous.

After leaving the restaurant, I held her hand again, this time without hesitation, and she proceeded to interlock her fingers with mine, clearly confirming that she liked it.

Near the end of the date, we also ended up kissing and then making out. We might have made out for over 2 minutes uninterrupted; sparks between us were off the charts, which I had never experienced to such an extent on a first date before.

Great going OP. With this question, you just caused me to have a sappy smile as I recall this memory.
"
26,"There is a time to be considerate of others and a time to do what is best for you. As much as you may have respected your ex, you aren't getting any more time to add to your life. If you're really seeking companionship, then don't waste time trying to be considerate of someone who is actually pushing you away during a time of need. 

I knew someone who was in a similar situation -- he broke up with her because his dad had a heart attack and was suddenly disabled and he needed to figure it out on his own. While I totally understand that position, it's contrary to what I would expect of someone in a relationship because I would look to my SO as a respite from all the junk in life. 

TL;DR Life is short. Don't waste time being too considerate to an ex."
27,"When I graduated from high school, I was mistaken for a middle school student. When I graduated from college, I was mistaken for a high school student. That was progress, of a sort."
28,"Single older men are creepy. 

I had a social event at a bar at my last job and my supervisor said there was a guy on her street who (as far as she could see) was single and was in his 40s or so and she thought it was creepy/weird even though he hadn't done anything to weird her out. I'm not in that position but it sucks to hear that when she doesn't know the guy at all"
29,"You can learn so much about a person by seeing who their friends are.

Ask a question about something that doesn't have a binary answer (yes/no). For example, politics. The reasoning behind the answer is what you're looking for, not the answer itself. Unless of course that's something you value.

How does he treat his waiter/bartender. That's a total stranger. You can get a baseline for his kindness, patience, intolerance, generosity. So many things."

96% effective, but Men dropping out of the study due to side effects like weight gain, acne, mood disorders, and generally complaining a lot. However 75% would use it again.

Sounds like female birth control, where a significant minority of women will have sufficiently shit side effects they can't or won't use a particular method. But those of us who don't are super happy to be using it. Pretty strange that they consider those side effects to be 'concerning' though,  when they sound incredibly typical for female birth control."
31,Like having a best friend who you also happen to want to bang a lot.  It's pretty awesome.
32,"Assuming both people are mature enough, political differences really shouldn't affect a relationship at all.

37,"You're not actually making the first move.

Making the first move is when you tell him that you're interested sexually/romantically/etc.

You're just starting a conversation."
38,Oi mate you're fucking creepy. 
39,"That men aren't meant to show affection towards kids that aren't theirs.

I work in a preschool and coach football, and I always feel like I have to ""be careful"" because parents are automatically suspicious of a guy who likes to be around kids. Eventually the guard lowers and the parents are generally quite positive about me, but I still dislike the ""feeling out"" stage."
40,"The only reason I can think of, is to keep a boner in check. 
Other than that I've never worn, or thought of a reason for wearing three pairs of boxer briefs"
41,"If he was recently released from prison, it's statistically likely that he will have more problems with the law in the future, possibly resulting in more jail time."

You've got someone to snuggle up with."
43,"Not knowing yourself well enough, to be honest. 

There's always a reason for attraction, whether it be because their faces are the right proportion and symmetrical (conventional), or because they look like your mom just younger (genetic, not too uncommon), or because they resemble the swimwear model from the Sears catalogue you used to rub one out to when you were 14.

Or it could be something other than a physical feature. It could be her posture or gait (if she looks confident, or resembles the girl you had a crush on in 3rd grade), or the way she laughs, or maybe the way the light shines off her hair reminds you of a happy time in your life. 

*Shrugs* People's brains are weird. "

46,"Pretty much this, though I'd also like to add ""incompetent commercial dad"" to that.

Man, I learned how to one-arm carry/burp my baby and clean up the living room way before mommy did.  A diaper doesn't just become some Gordian Knot of confusion just because I'm a man "
47,"There always seems to be something wrong with the younger generation. Teenage boys and young men in the 80s liked glam metal and wore tight clothes, or were ""nerds"" with thick glasses, who knew their way around a circuit board, but who were painfully awkward around women. In the 70s classic rock was considered by older generations to be ""noise."" Parents were concerned about a new generation of men influenced by androgynous David Bowie, Queen, and Alice Cooper. In the 60s, long-haired, conscientious young men protesting the Vietnam war would cry, ""Don't want no war!"" To which their parents, hardened by World War II, would reply, ""Don't want no job either!"" Shifting attitudes in the realm of civil rights led to more women entering the workforce: surely a product of the lack of ""real men"" to care for them.


There has been a shift in marketable skills that has tracked technological advances. Miners, craftsmen, construction workers, factory workers, and farmers have been replaced by machinery, which has made physical toughness unnecessary. Biceps and brawn are not needed to write code (read: to make a living). We now consider it a crime to put a plow into the hands of a 14-year-old boy (where a pencil and schoolbooks belong). This did not used to be the case.  


More homosexual men than ever can be their authentic selves without fearing for their safety. And many of us now suspect that we have been undervaluing men's emotional needs as a society. Men's fashion and cosmetics are becoming more important as men realize that women tend to like men who know how to dress and take care of their skin. And we're beginning to lose our patience for bullying and the notion that liking pop music, or becoming a figure skater makes you feminine. And we'd rather see our men's heads used for science than for slamming into someone on the football field, triggering the onset of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in middle age.


All of this is cause for celebration. Men are not under the same constraints. They can be themselves. What it means to be masculine has changed and will continue to change. And that's ok. 









"
48,"Yep.

Benefit: Everybody you date will be someone you picked, and you don't have to wait for someone you like to take the initiative.

Drawback:  You have to cast a lot of lines to catch a good fish.  Sometimes there's no fish at all.  Sometimes they don't bite.  Sometimes you have to throw them back.

Now you understand why copypasta is so common on dating sites.  It's the equivalent of drag net fishing.

As others have suggested, you do have to keep the pressure going to build some momentum to get the thing going.  You have to keep showing interest and push for more.  Getting into a relationship isn't risking just one rejection.  It's risking several dozen."

53,"I love this question. :)

A week before we stared officially dating, her and I went to the museum of natural history as friends. We spent a good 4-5 hours looking at all the exhibits and watching videos on dinosaurs, ancient civilizations, space, and other stuff. 

On the ride back back (in the subway) we were both really tired and we're both closing our eyes to rest for a minute. Next thing I know, she places her hand over mine. I look over to her, and I see that she still has her eyes closed. 

I rearranged my hand so that I could intertwine our fingers. The week afterwards, we officially started dating and so far, we are three years strong. 

I really need to marry this woman. "

Me: ""Like cigarettes?""

Then we held other things for other stuff.... "
59,"Enthusiasm is King.  

Bear with me:
If you've ever seen most porn videos, you'll notice the reaction from the female performer(s)

They're amazed at the size of that dick.
They need that dick.
They can't get enough of that dick.
After the man ejaculates, she doesn't treat it like it's gross, in fact, most of the time they treat it like the shit that comes out of a caramello.

The vast majority of porn is written by men for men. And men want you to be very excited about getting to suck that dick.

Most ""techniques"" are just for show. But enthusiasm will last in his memory forever.

"
60,"So you're basically still her boyfriend without her actually being your girlfriend. It sucks, dude, but you've got to extract yourself from this situation. For your sake, get some space from her and stop doing boyfriend things with her. 

If you find someone else to date, that's great. But I'm more concerned about you being taken advantage of by a girl who knows she doesn't want to be with you but can't quite bring herself to give you up.

This situation is the exact one where you stay ""with"" her in the hope that something changes, and then out of nowhere, she introduces you to her new boyfriend. 

""It just happened,"" she'll say. ""And besides, we were broken up.""

And that's how you end up more miserable than you are now. 

Trust me, man. It's time to move on."
61,"And men who don't want sex all the time are emasculine, and if a man doesn't want sex with his partner when offered it's because he finds her unattractive or is cheating on her.  Oh, and if a man can't perform on a particular occasion it's because he finds his partner unattractive.  

Really, anything that follows from the narrative that men always want sex and always need sex and if they don't something is wrong.  "
62,"Imagine if I made a post saying:

63,"We were walking around a park in his hometown in the late morning, and we sat on this bench overlooking most of the park (it was kind of on the edges of the park, just off the trail near this beautiful forest behind us). He put his arm around me and I leaned against him, we made out for a little while, and then he ran his hand down my stomach and into my yoga pants. He felt how wet I was, rubbed my clit and started to fingerfuck me. We had to stop occasionally since there were runners/bikers on the trail, but I was so turned on that I came with his finger deep inside me, his free hand clamped over my mouth so that nobody could hear my moans. It was pretty hot. 

Oh, and he always wakes up earlier than I do in the morning. Several times he's masturbated right beside me while I was sleeping, then came on my face. I'll wake up, still sleepy with cum all over my face, and then I suck off the rest of the cum on his dick. 10/10. "
64,"Yeah I often read guys on Reddit who claim to have ""problems meeting women"" who go out to a bar or something and just expect women to approach them and strike up a conversation, and when women don't, they assume women don't like them or they're destined to be foreveralone or something.

Nothing in life of true value will ever just fall into your hands, you have to work for it.  If you wait for it to just happen, you'll be waiting for years and it will just make you bitter and old."

67,Attraction's not a conscious choice.
68,"Men inherently make more money in the workplace since women earn $0.78 for every $1 a man makes.

Yes, sexism exists in our society.  I agree that women face hurdles in their career which men do not.  Diversity is important and should be encouraged.  However, this statistic is grossly misunderstood and frequently misused creating a false picture of what's actually happening in our culture.

This number is calculated by comparing the median income of men with the median income of women, not by occupation, but in aggregate across our economy.  There is a difference between these two values (~$0.22) but what is ignored is the fact that some of the highest paid careers tend to be male dominated (engineering, computer science, etc) while careers dominated by women tend to be compensated less simply based on the nature of the position (childhood education, health services, etc).  

It's this trend that skews this value more than actual discrepancy in pay, which may exist in some instances, but is in no way a reason demonize men for making more than women solely because they're men.

The following article from the Washington Post backs this up : https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/04/02/the-equal-pay-day-factoid-that-women-make-78-cents-for-every-dollar-earned-by-men/"
69,"It would only be alright under the context that I'm obviously invited but for whatever reason can't be there. Like if my buddy from another state came to town and wanted to get drinks with both of us but I couldn't make it, I wouldn't care if my SO went to get drinks with him. If my buddy and SO made plans without me, that's weird as hell. 

Years ago (when I was still in high school) my friend and my girlfriend and I would all hang out, and they wanted to hang out even when I wasn't there. I thought it made me cool and mature that I was fine with it and trusted them both. It actually made me an idiot - they were hooking up. "

87,"&gt; How does he treat his waiter/bartender. That's a total stranger. You can get a baseline for his kindness, patience, intolerance, generosity. So many things.

Honestly, I've stopped using this as a litmus test simply because far too many people are now *aware* of observations of their behaviour. What I now look out for specifically is how they deal with people when they think I'm not watching. It's not like you're actually shadowing them or anything, but just observing how they interact with animals or people when they don't know you're watching them. 

A long time ago, I was observing my roommates new boyfriend and the man was charming as fuck, was most excellent to all the waiters, played with my roommate's dog, etc. Anyway, fast forward to a few weeks in and I was heading to the kitchen, so while I was in the corridor I noticed that he was sitting in the living room (probably waiting for my roommate as they looked like they were heading for a night out). I didn't say anything, something made me just stand quietly and watch what he did. 

The dog was sitting on the sofa cushion next to him and he was sorta....*poking*? (I couldn't see from my angle, but it looked like he was prodding the dog). Now I know this dog, it will fucking *snap* if it doesn't like something, so it did. Then what the guy did just fucking *floored* me - he yelled, then straight up punched the dog, grabbed it by the collar and threw it to the floor with some amount of force. Dog cried in terror and ran off (examined him later in the evening and took him to the vet with my roommate the next morning, he was alright, thankfully). 

That's when I knew Mr. Charming had *severe* anger issues and I somehow managed to convince my roommate to not go out that night and to trust me. She was mad as fuck because she thought I was having a ""foreign medieval culture weirdo"" moment when I couldn't explain why, but I genuinely feared for her safety. When I finally did get the chance to explain my actions (not the greatest, having to explain creeping on the guy like that), she could see why, but she still didn't entirely believe me, I think. Anyway, that was the last I ever saw of Mr. Volcano. 

I honestly believe that had I not seen that episode, I wouldn't have pegged him as being that sort of guy *at all*. "
88,"Gf gained weight and became unnattractive to me. To be honest, she still looked ok but she was so insecure about it that it became a constant battle to make her feel good about herself.

I got resentful that I couldnt change her behaviour and she became resentful that I wasnt helping her lose weight. She ended up cheating on me."

104,"She gained weight and went from curvy to shapeless, on the precipice of fat. Developed a lot of insecurity issues, constant jealous remarks about other women, paranoia about women I work with, all the while eating with no control and very little exercise. I kept inviting her to gym / running with me - when we started dating she would exercise pretty much every day - but she just stayed home and watched tv. 

Pretty soon she started giving me shit for going to gym or running (because it made her feel bad she wasn't doing anything for herself), and she became very clingy and needy. I was really unhappy about the situation and our bedroom was effectively dead for five months. I really wanted her to work through her issues but nothing helped.

She just failed to understand that she was the only one person responsible for how she looks - no one but her decides what she eats or how much, and no one can do exercise for her. We broke up six weeks ago after dating for two years and living together for six months. "

107,Political beliefs are often little more than public sentiments about core values.
108,"Guys don't have much social support. When I had social anxiety and very low self-esteem I was literally isolated. Nobody would make an effort to interact with me and I didn't make an effort either so I just ended up in a position where I had ""no way out"". Eventually, I did create my own way out but I had to do it on my own. 

By comparison, girls have a strong social support network. They are social from a younger age and maintain social relationships, which means when they are feeling down they have people to support them. ""No, you don't look fat in that dress"", ""He doesn't deserve you anyway"", and ""You totally look fabulous"" sound familiar? 

From what I've read, guys don't exactly get compliments or support very often. If you do well, it's just expected. If you do very well, people look up to you, but then you don't have a problem anyway. If you do badly, you're basically alone.

Of course, it also depends on the individual circumstance. My friends are all very supportive of each other and I fixed my social anxiety through my own efforts so it's not always a dead-end.

111,"My wife was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer 5 weeks before our 1st wedding anniversary. That wasn't the greatest heartbreak. 

She went through 5 surgeries, 6 rounds of radiation, and 3 years of constant chemo. I had to be her rock and be strong for her every day of those 3 years. I had to be brave and tell her that we were going to kick cancer's ass, even though I was dying inside. That wasn't the greatest heartbreak either.

She died on July 1st (3 weeks before my bday) and we buried her on the 4th of July. Neither of those were the greatest heartbreak either.

The greatest heartbreak was sitting with her every night the three weeks or so leading up to her death, holding her hand, talking to her, and knowing that she had no idea who I was, where she was, or what was happening to her. That's what hurt the most. I lost her well before she died."
112,"Like many situations on AskMen, having an adult discussion will solve the problem. I would talk to her and say something like- ""I understand that you are dealing with some issues right now. I care about you but I need to know what future we have."" You need to analyze her behavior and responses carefully. Several things can come out of it-

1. She legitimately needs some time without a relationship to focus on her problems. After she resolves these issues, she wants you back.      
2. She legitimately needs this time but she doesn't see herself with you in the future.  
3. She has already moved on and this ""need some time"" is BS and she is  with other guys. 

Once you have some more clarity about the situation, you need to decide what you are willing to risk/give up for her. Questions you need to honestly answer for yourself-  
1. Are you willing to wait until she resolves these issues?  
2. What happens if you wait and she doesn't want you back?  
3. Can you deal with this type of behavior in the future if you are married?  

In some rare cases, helping someone through a difficult time is ok. Thats what we do for people we care about. OTOH, life is short and its usually better to cut and run, learn form the situation and find someone else. She is not the only woman in the world. Only you can make the decision about what is right for your life but if it was me, I would cut ties and move on. "

126,"I'm probably late to the party, but I hope you read this /u/CorleoneGuy. When you're a couple in love, you truly love her, and she truly loves you, you are complete in a way that's hard to understand until you've been there. There's a reason people call their significant other their ""better half"". It's not me and her, it's us.

I want you to pause and reflect on that for half a second. Us. It's a feeling of fulfillment in a part of you that you might not even know about until it happens, because it's... It's like being blind but suddenly you see.

There's a phrase that goes something like, ""Love is patient. Love is understanding."" etc etc. But while that's true, love is also an understanding in and of itself. It's an entire new sense. A limb you didn't know you have. A piece of your brain that is unlocked. Love songs make sense. Art looks different. You mature in some ways, and feel blissfully young in others. To sum it up in a few words, you change, wholly, irrevocably, and I'd like to think for the better. 

On the flip side, it's the single most painful experience you will ever have. Your heart is entwined with a living breathing person, and when she hurts, you'll bleed inside. When she's sad, when she's angry, when she's hurt, when she's sick, it burns and thrashes inside you.

Empathy was the greatest and hardest lesson I learned from my first real love, and it changed how I interacted with the people around me in a big way. I grew into a better person. I became more confident, because she believed in me. I became more comfortable with myself, because she loved me despite everything I hated about myself. I became kinder, because I wanted her to be proud of me. I worked on myself in any way I could think of because she didn't become a part of my world. She was my world.

It was life changing, and I've never been the same since then. I could wax poetic for weeks like this, but I should probably bring it to a close so I don't make an idiot of myself.  
TL;DR It's the most beautiful and addicting agony you cannot possibly imagine, and I wouldn't give away a second of it for the world and everything in it.

*scrolls to next comment*"
136,"Thank you.

We need to have a real honest to god conversation about this and nobody wants to because, like you said, you feel gross arguing about it.

We have to accept that there are nonverbal ""requests for consent"" or we wind up like PC Principle from South Park asking ""I would like to crush your Puss.  Do I have your consent""  ""gigle... Oh I guess so""  ""No.  that is not good enough.  I must have explicit verbal consent before I begin to crush your Puss""

But there is a line where nonverbal requests cross over into intimidation.  Like Always Sunny's ""Of course if she says no we stop, but she won't say no.  Because of the implication""

It's a mess and the fact that it is a mess is being used against both sides... both in stupid tumbler arguments and in courtrooms.  We need to decide what is a real request for consent, what isn't, teach people what they are, and then hold people to that.  "

- Not respecting their date/girlfriend's decisions.  This doesn't even have to involve anything sexual, trying to push a date to eat a particular dish after she has said she wanted to eat something else is basic controlling behavior.

I met a girl when she was a couple months pregnant, fell pretty hard. Helped her through the process, ended up even being her birth partner.  Cutest kid.  I did everything right, was very supportive, a life saver when she wasn't able to get around by herself. 

Anyway, she works through PPD.  After that, we're still going strong, the cute kid helps.  Come Christmas time, we're house sitting, with the kid, having a great time.  Exchange gifts, the whole works.  I go to work one day, stop a friend's house on the way home.  Sending her texts but I'm getting terse comments in reply.  I figure she's just busy or something, get going.

I walk through the door, and everything is just gone.  All the baby stuff, stroller, walker, everything.  All hints of her and the baby have just been vacuumed up.  A little note left on the counter, saying ""Nice knowing you.""

T_T most awkward thing in the world was having to tell people when they asked about the cute little baby they'd had the chance to meet. 

She ended up giving the kid up to her parents, getting married, getting divorced, and this was all in the last 2 years.

147,"So true. Once I was working at a summer camp that consisted of 5 to 10 year old, boys and girls. On the last day, one of the girls surprise-hugged me by my right side while another girl started to hug me by my left side ( I was able to somewhat ""stop"" her). 

As it happened, one of the female counselors said, ""girls, 16 year old boys aren't supposed to get hugs from little girls."" Or something along those lines. 

I understand that, she probably said that to avoid backlash from parents ( she was a parent herself). 

But just having that stigma against you, stings a little. I was well known amongst some of the the staff. So I wasn't just some random stranger who applied for the job. All the trust that I had gained over a period of three years just went out the window.

This isn’t to say I don’t have a problem with women being stereotyped- of course I do, but it seems to me that in my generation it is quite fashionable to condemn stereotypes against women for what they are- and one can do so quite openly. And yet as a male, if I reject a stereotype pointed towards me, I’m apparently in need of a talking to about male privilege. Our dissent is essentially the blasphemy of our times and when we do not agree with the present narrative, our opinion is often dismissed as “mansplaining” and we are accused of being “bigoted”.

I walk up to her and before I can say anything, she laughs and turns away. Confused, I looked at the people standing there wondering what's going on and she says, ""I'm not going with him. I would rather stay home than do that."". Then it hit me; she was laughing at me. She was talking about me being ugly and laughing in my face at how unattractive I was.

Within the span of a week, two of my friends straight up called me out on it. One of my closest female friends told me that she was starting to feel uncomfortable around me, and my best friend just told me, ""You are being a creep and you need to stop.""

192,"Man, I'd get in trouble for this.

When I first started dating my girlfriend she was in school getting straight A's.  She studied hard, worked harder, and kicked ass.  It was really important to her that she appeared smart, and people thought she was smart.

Over 6 years I've since realized she just avoids anything she's not already good at.  She studied for 8 hours a day because that's how long it took her to read and remember 20 pages.  She's functionally illiterate.  I'd say she's bad at math too, but it's worse than that.  She fundamentally doesn't understand numbers and how they work.  So money causes her constant anxiety.

Getting a smart phone was the worst thing to ever happen to our relationship, and she's so ADD it's impossible to have a conversation with her.  Multiple times in a single sentence she'll space out and stop paying attention.  I've had to repeat myself 4 or 5 times with her, trying to have a casual conversation.  Eventually I give up.

Whenever we get a new appliance for the house, I have to teach her how to use it over and over again, sometimes for months, before it finally sticks, if it ever sticks.  We've used the Playstation 3 to watch Netflix and Youtube the entire duration of our relationship, and she still sometimes forgets how it works.  We got a new TV 2 months ago and that's been a constant uphill struggle as well.

The worst part is, she's so sensitive about it, I'm honestly at a loss.  Anything that makes her feel stupid causes her to rage out.  And most things make her feel stupid.

Obvious disclaimer: This does not capture the whole of our relationship.  There are plenty of good reasons I'm with this woman.  You don't know me, her, or us."

I'm on the large side of average and the 'standard' size condoms I've tried ended up being too tight. By 'too tight' I mean, I got as much pleasure from PIV as from fingering her.  I experimented a bit and condoms are an option again.

231,"1st Generation American-Bengali. I'm in my freshmen year of college and I definitely have some pointers. 

1. Workout:
 From what I've experienced, people from South Asia in general seem to be either on the skinny side or chubby side of the spectrum without much in the middle. This isn't surprising considering a huge part of the diet consists of rice and lentils without any portion control. By working out,  not only will you be able to raise your confidence,  but also attractiveness. 

2. Dress Well, Smell Good,  and Groom:
The difference in fashion styles is huge when coming from South Asia to America. In order to fit in better,  dressing your age and more like an American will help you socialize and be more approachable. This means making sure your clothes fit your body style and highlights your skin tone. Try to avoid jeans with designs on them (something common I see). Find clothing that isn't too tight or too loose. Subreddits like r/malefashionadvice is a great place to see many different styles and see what you like. Make sure you keep your clothing away from wherever you cook and when doing laundry,  you take it away from the kitchen area as soon as possible. Find a cologne that smells nice - nothing too overpowering. Keep your hair trimmed and find a barber who can give you a decent haircut. Try to go back at least every month. Indian hair is often oily so find a shampoo like Head and Shoulders or Selsun Blue. 

3. Social Norms:
Talking to different people is often the hardest part about integrating with American culture. The best advice for this is ""fake it till you make it"". Act confident and you will definitely be more approachable. Try to notice social cues when talking to people. Asians often come off as very forward due to the culture overseas being different. If you're texting someone and they seem to be responding less and less or with few words it probably means they do not want to talk. If they seem to be wanting to end the conversation, then just it be. Smile whenever possible,  you'll come off as a nicer person and again more approachable. Most everything else can be learned. Lastly,  you will encounter racism. Although it may not be super common,  try not to be offended. Some people will make generalizations about you regardless of who you are. 

4. School:
Do not slack on your grades. No matter what stereotypes you hear or what anyone says. If you can get good grades then it'll help you in the future. Remember that one or two bad grades will not kill you and that things will be okay. Study hard, but remember it is okay to take a break.

Chivalry is insisting but relenting. Further, it is relenting in respect of the lady's ability to display her own competance (which I think is kinda sexy), and the insistance is born only out of a desire to provide. As soon as the insistence is because ""that's how it should be,"" it is no longer Chivalry but chauvinism."

304,"**Giving?**

Probably the times when it was still very new and exciting for both of us. Her reactions and her voice and the excitement and everything were just incredible; the first few times just the act of making out with her vulva as if it were a nether mouth made *me* cum.


**Receiving?**

Hard to pick one time. Her blowjobs have always been completely different from anything I had imagined, and from anything I later saw in porn; there are four kinds of blowjob she offers and all of them are pretty...unique.

My favorite probably is what she calls ""loving me with her mouth"", where she'll lie down at a perpendicular angle to me on the bed, resting her cheek on my belly. Then she'll put one hand between her legs to play with her clit (that part's important) and use her other arm either to sorta hug me or run her free hand over my chest or hold my hand.

Like that, she'll take me into her mouth, slipping back the foreskin with her teeth, and then just swirl her tongue around my glans. No bobbing, no hands, no nothing, just swirling her tongue. At every *n*-th swirl, she'll pause, will tighten her lips for a moment, or give the shaft a gentle *tiny* bite just behind the glans, or will give a little suck. Then she'll again swirl her tongue. All this happens with so much gentleness that I almost can't bear it, and the longer it goes on, the more it feels like I'm being melted in a paradise of warmth and wetness and softness.

Meanwhile, I 1.) absolutely have to let my voice out and 2.) have to play with her hair, not being allowed to take my hands out of her hair, or she'll stop. I'm allowed to take one hand away for a moment to caress as much of her as I can reach, or to hold her free hand, but at least one hand always has to remain in her hair, and the more I play with her hair, the more tiny sucks, the more gentle little bites and the more soft moans I get from her.

All that plus the fact alone that she's petting her clit at the same time makes me feel so incredibly close to her, which is only heightened by how incredibly *into it* she gets. On top of that, she's really good at getting us both to cum at the same time, which makes me feel like my heart's gonna stop with happiness and closeness and love. It's especially intense when she'll simply not stop even while I am coming; she'll just open her mouth a little to let the cum drip out and keep on going, while I'm getting full-body winces, seeing stars flickering across my vision, moaning and whimpering uncontrollably, and unable to let go of her hair. To hear her own moans because she's gotten her off at the same time in that moment is just incredible, and I usually need a looooong hug after that because I'm so opened up and vulnerable that I just need to feel her close."

Just last week I wrote a pre-sentence investigation report for an 18 year old male who was charged with felony theft. His 16 year old girlfriend broke into her step-fathers safe and stole gold bullion, jewelry, and silver bars and tried to pawn them. She wasn't able to because you have to be 18 to pawn things, so she called her boyfriend and told him that she had inherited these items from her uncle and could he pawn them for her. He did so and brought her the money. The parents discovered the items missing and the daughter confessed and told them that her boyfriend pawned them. They recovered the items and had the boyfriend arrested. The girl wasn't charged with anything and the boyfriend is now a convicted felon with 10 years probation."

I'd be so impressed with all the things I've accomplished and everything I'd overcome that I'd literally be swooning over myself. And, best of all, I'd know exactly how it felt to be myself. It would be an INSTENSE connection. I'd say things that would make me melt. I'd never have to worry about being misunderstood because I'd always give myself the benefit of the doubt. I'd take me to meet my family, and I'd know they'd all love me. And if I decided to have kids with myself, I'd be thrilled if they came out anything like me or myself. I guess I've just been waiting on someone like me for my entire life. I can't wait to meet me. In the long run, I think I was made for myself. I just fit together with me. "

326,"Tell him that his behavior is unacceptable and inappropriate, especially when he's hitting on your female friends and making them uncomfortable. I have a group of friends and a large chunk of them are guys; we've been hanging out for years. They have this one new friend and he is beyond inappropriate.

He knows that the girls in the group are all close with his male friends but he will not stop being inappropriate. He constantly hits on us (even after we express hard ""no's""), says inappropriate things, and is an embarrassment to bring in public because of how he acts around girls. 

You will never bring new girls to your parties/bars/hangouts if he is acting this way in your group; he will scare ALL of them away. 

My friend's friend makes going out with them somewhat of an unpleasant time, and the worst of it is that he doesn't seem to feel any shame. He doesn't seem to understand how bad it is; his friends will tell him not to do things and he always says ""why? what's wrong with ___?"". He will walk up to girls in bars and say inappropriate things, hit on waitresses, and say creepy things and not understand why girls are disgusted.

For the love of yours and your friends' social lives, tell him his behavior is inappropriate and needs to stop (explain why, be blunt but don't be brutal) or he can't go out with you guys.

347,"Well... I had a situation that kinda sorta matches the title, but not really the second paragraph. Nothing *changed*, it's just we didn't know the relationship would work so well.

In college I was living with my girlfriend and soulmate. Relationship was incredibly great, I was happy as can be and for whatever reason, apparently her too. However, I had had for a long time a dream: after graduation and before entering a lifetime of adulthood settled somewhere, I'd go on an adventure abroad, for at least a year, and probably no more. We discussed about everything, so she knew rather soon about it. And I guess I had an influence on her, because soon she wanted to do exactly that too.

But, our graduations were a year apart, so that would mean, at least two years of separations. We were young, that seemed too long, and our dreams a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. So, years went by and graduation approached, it was decided we'd separate the moment I set foot in the plane. There was a lot of crying.

In the end, though, this separation ended up purely theoretical and never was followed through. We were skyping every day for hours, and every time we'd meet again during a family visit in vacation, we'd put the breakup on hold. When she got back we settled together and ended up married.

349,"College is a weird place. Nobody interrupts anybody for the most part. Even if you're just on your phone, nobody is going to approach you. I don't approach anybody but that's because I made a conscious decision and all this goddamn reading is going to take precedence for at least one more semester and then I can give a shit about meeting people again. 

High school is terrible training for society because everybody is stuffed together and socializing is easier because of an imagined community but in college, proximity to one another means absolutely nothing and relationships need to be built of mutual interests and you just fucking going up to somebody and talking to them."
350,"I guess you can say... You tore yourself a new one.

We met afterwards, spending time with friends. All night horror movie marathons, Dungeons and Dragons games, watching movies at the drive-in from the bed of a pickup.  
She spent time with me and the girl that I had a crush on, gaming and going to the Renaissance fair.  
We went for an eight hour drive with another friend to visit our friend's parents. Sleigh riding, homemade eggnog, and a general good time. This was the time that I realized that she was the girl for me.  
Eventually we ended up spending a few years together, not entirely on our own due to income restraints, but renting a house with a couple of college roommates.  
We married in a low budget ceremony in a log cabin. Most of our wedding gifts were camping gear, which we used to go on our honeymoon.

353,"You're not doing anything wrong. I have had girls make the first move, and it's amazing and I wish more women would do it.

And we were both awkwardly aware of the fact we had nothing left to say. I was very attracted to her we just didn't have chemistry and I was just out of a relationship and very rusty.

I would consider myself a good person, intelligent and relatively successful, but bringing up my past has been a bitch because I know what you say is true. Sometimes, as soon as I mention that I don't talk to my mom anymore, I get a cold shoulder. How does one even talk about something like this?

Even when I was little, as soon as I was old enough to walk and hold small objects, I did stuff like set the table... one fork at a time. Then I graduated to carrying plates to the table and eventually a whole tray. This extended to laundry, mopping floors, toilets, etc. 

My girlfriend now gets mad when she is cooking dinner and I come in the kitchen and try and help. She has a small kitchen and I just get in the way. ""Why don't you just go sit in the living room and watch baseball? I'll bring you dinner when it's ready."" It feels super weird to me. "

360,"Earlier this year I met a smoking hot MILF (I'm 33, she's 39 and a mother of two teenage boys) off of a dating app and when we met up, she ended up ordering two miniature bottles of champagne.  For herself.  The entire bill for dinner was like $80 and she didn't offer to even split the check.  The fuck?

But, she was ridiculously sexy and I wanted that ass, so I asked her out the following Friday night.  We meet at my favorite bar near my house and AGAIN she's downing the champagne.  She brings up that she's very old-fashioned in her approach to dating.  Which is to say that she thinks guys should always pay for everything.  Now, she's a very nice, sweet woman with a body to fucking die for so I don't say anything to ruin my chances of taking her home that night, which I do.  As soon as we get to my place she's got her tongue down my throat and wants to get freaky.  I'm happy to oblige.

I saw her a couple more times but only invited her over to my place to ""hang out"" because fuck dropping a wad of cash every time I see you, that's absurd and how do you think that's ok?

377,"I know we're not supposed to talk about it, but I think men face a similar dilemma as women when it comes to societal pressure. Men are expected to be manly and stoic - they're supposed to live up to the masculine ideal; to be status and power driven with the inborn trait and need to be strong and brave and fearless. 

A lot of men are intimidated and feel inferior around guys with the sports car, the big bank account, and the hot bottle blonde. They feel insecure around the macho athletic guy with the big muscles and six pack abs. Why? Because we are ingrained with the idea that this is alpha; this is what society wants us to be, this is what women are attracted to, and this is what symbolizes power. If you don't desire that, well, you're pretty much useless. You're deemed an effeminate pansy or a mama's boy or some slacker outcast. Over time this starts to have an effect on the male psyche and causes all sorts of anxiety and self-esteem issues. Just look at all the young men basically dropping out of society. From one perspective they're not 'manly' enough, and from another point of view they are potential rapists and losers who only care about video games. So what do they do? They become the perception what society has of them. So they just drop out, unwanted, and unloved.

If guys have any thing that is bothering them? HA! Keep that bottled in. Be a man! Go sign up and fight and die for your country! Go play sports, go make yourself useful. Be a man! 

The reality is, most men aren't like that. They aren't ""alpha"", they aren't robots without emotions. Since technological progress has rendered gender roles virtually useless, ""masculine values"" aren't really necessary. So what we have here are hordes of confused and isolated and disposable men who are shunned by society.

Also, people should be careful not to confuse real confidence (being secure with oneself) vs arrogance that stems from narcissism. 

Anyway, hopefully some day those archaic gender roles and ideals are eliminated from the collective consciousness, both women and men might have an easier time. "

She had my permission, but it was still too weird for me. It was the condition for trying anal in the bedroom. 

She touched her finger to my asshole and my body clenched so hard I'm surprised she didn't lose the tip of her finger. "
401,"&gt; All of this is cause for celebration. Men are not under the same constraints. They can be themselves. What it means to be masculine has changed and will continue to change. And that's ok.

This is the most important point, I think. We're becoming a more open, accepting, understanding society and are slowly inching away from a time where repression/hyper-masculinity was the norm. What a time to be alive. "
402,"I do have (more like had) lots of hobbies, but after a while, you just can't enjoy doing these things on your own anymore, you feel like you need to have someone else do these things with you.

I've basically given up on everything and I'm just trying to drown my days with reddit and video games, trying not to let how alone I am get to me.

I've asked around about clubs, the only active one in which I'm interested in was basically a group of 10 - 15 people who were really close to each other and I always felt like an outsider amongst them, so I stopped going.

And by ""sitting around trying not to look busy"" I meant more like not having headphones on, or studying, etc. The type of stuff if I saw someone else doing I wouldn't wanna interrupt them just to have a small talk."
403,"I was about 13 when I realized that, come hell or high water, I was gonna jack off every day no matter what."
404,"I dated a girl whose parents were from Hong Kong, but she was born and raised in England. There were no issues from either of our friends or families, but one time a guy in a car shouted ""mail order bride"" at us as he drove past. It made both of us feel like shit, to be honest. "
405,"I think it's great, but like the above poster said if she doesn't follow through, don't expect the guy to pick it up. If I was on a smoke break and a woman and I started a conversation while smoking I don't see that as her coming on to me: she's just being friendly. 

It sounds like OP comes across (in the bar situation, at least) as very friendly but maybe not interested. 

I have no idea about the Tinder part; if a girl was like 'oh hey let's just fuck' she'd have to smell weird or be very unattractive for me to turn that down. "
406,"Was fat/socially retarded. 

Now I'm fit and socially retarded."
407,"My cousin did the same thing, and in the article it asked for men to teach their sons not to rape and abuse women. Can you imagine if it was something like ""Muslim's teach your sons not to be terrorists?"" The backlash would be monumental. But no, its ok because it's men."
408,"You're going to hate it but don't be afraid to make the first move. If you're rejected, don't give up. Guys get rejected hundreds of times before they're accepted. It gets easier after you get used to it. Way too many females make a move, get rejected once and then give up"
409,"I've had many female friends tell me they often withhold sex from their boyfriends for weeks at a time but get incredibly angry if they are rejected for sex because it automatically means he is not attracted to them. 

But somehow, claiming you are not in the mood for 3 weeks straight is not insulting to him, and he should respect that you don't feel like it. It's weird."
410,"I experienced a sharp pain on my ass when pooping. Went to the doctor, turns out I have an anal fissure.     

For those who don't know, that means the skin inside my asshole tore open. "
411,[deleted]
412,Okay what is with this attitude in women? No fat man will ever dare to make this comment because they know it's true. I was a fat dude too. I was sad about it but never once did I blame girls for not being attracted to me because I was fat? That's some next level deflection.
413,"Well then stand up, and have another seat. "
414,Probably the ones related to IT and men working in this industry.
415,"Ah, the ol'

""It's hot until somebody I care about looks hot, then it's terrible."""
416,Light up a cigarette.
417,Shaving my beard. Need to take a photo and tape it to my bathroom mirror as a reminder of why this can't ever happen again.
418,"I think you're misinterpreting why woman are going to be butthurt. I think user is trying to say that women will have to deal with what men have been dealing with is ENTIRE time, except it'll be a new concept to them and they'll complain about putting putting themselves out there and..... Not getting any results.

As opposed to just waiting for a good guy to find you and wanting you and hurrah! Success!"
419,If I'm sleeping with someone that's like the *minimum* level of trust required. 
420,I used to be self conscious about my body because I was a fat fuck. So I lost weight and became a non-fat fuck powerlifter/athlete. Now I'll always just be weak. 
421,[deleted]
422,"There it is, the only reasonable answer."
423,"Not to get into stereotypes, but I work in theatre, and I know what you're talking about.  Just like everyone else, gay people come in all kinds.  My boss and my brother, unless they told you, you probably wouldn't really guess that they were gay.  They don't all lisp and yell ""HAAAYYYY."""
424,"You were pretty much trying to narrow down her location, it's weird that you now think it's ""too much information"" after you creeped her post history dude"
425,"If this is her way of dealing with things now, then it's a red flag for later in the relationship -- a huge red flag if you would think of marrying her some day. 

If her family treats you like their own, then they'll be happy for you if you start dating someone else."
426,"I always see this stuff on Reddit, usually /r/AskReddit, talking about how guys spend a lot of time thinking about literally nothing/really stupid stuff, how they need everything spelt out for them and can't pick up on subtleties, and about how guys are just incredibly simple in what they want and need. "
427,"Ah, the love language thing.  I go back and forth between thinking its exactly right and total BS.  Mainly because I don't know if anyone is any one thing"
428,Oh wow that derailed in the end 
429,"Absolutely this.  Mostly because I'm a straight guy.
 
But it's also true that I've slept with more women than I've held hands with."
430,This happened with my current boss. She started a little over a year after me and within a year had been promoted to Director of the department. If she was incompetent it would have driven me up the wall but she's very effective at her job and we've become good friends since. We actually work better as a team this way and she's getting me a promotion to work directly for her in the next few weeks. She might actually be the best boss I've ever had so I've got no complaints about the situation.
431,Only good once and leave generations of destruction and suffering in your wake?
432,"Friends yes, family iffy. 

I tend to keep my SO's away from my family, only because my family would pester me to no end if even the slightest mention of SO appears. Not to mention jumping straight to marriage talks and children. So yeah sorry but I'm keeping you away from my family because it's none of their damn business."
433,"Whenever ""not looking"" tends to work out like that, it also tends to be defined as ""when you're having a blast doing really cool shit and having lots of friends and basically being the kind of person others are actively looking for"". If you aren't doing that, it doesn't work like that. Even if you're doing that, you'll still have to do some pursuing."
434,"/r/askwomen would ban you outright for some silly bullshit like ""no gendered insults"" or ""no invalidation"" or my favorite ""no opinions that we disagree with"".  That place is a fucking echo chamber with mods acting as emotional body guards for women who don't need it and can have a normal conversation.  "
435,"When I realized that basic math/accounting was not her strong suit. She had a side business in antiques that was always losing money. The booth rent was $150 and at the end of the month even with sales she’d still end up writing a check for a $80-90 to cover her rent balance after sales. The booth did not drive sales in any other capacity/venue. It was a sick joke, but she always thought she was making money. 

She's now an EX"
436,"Cholula for breakfast food.

Tapatio for making shitty frozen foods edible."
437,"- Small fry doesn't matter, it's the bigger picture that matters. Little incompatibilities on their own don't matter.

- Out of the great compatibilities - physical-sexual, emotional, depth-psychological and intellectual - I personally find intellectual compatibility the least important: You can have a large subset of diverging interests and opinions and still be reasonably happy, whereas the other ones are make or break."
438,"Thanks for that major downer.

Signed, 24 year old with no long term dating experience. "
439,"I got my little sister a copy of The Guide To Getting It On because our parents neglected her sex ed but she wouldn't have been willing to have a direct conversation about it with me. It covers the basics of just about everything, from consent to STI prevention to the basic mechanics of standard sex acts."
440,And shave your mustache. Don't model your hair style after your father's
441,"&gt; expect us to throw glitters every time we walk into a room

Im not gay, but fuck I'd love glitter cannons in every room I walked into"
442,"Fuck, that. I was dating this guy for a few months, and he never, *never* let me pay. So when we went out on his birthday, I snuck off ""to the bathroom"" and paid the bill. I thought he'd laugh and it would be funny... It wasn't. He was actually angry. I got the hell outta dodge a week later. "
443,"Honestly probably a 5 or a 6. Yeah I like kinky shit, and am down to try just about anything, but there are dudes out there shitting diarrhea into diapers with full on erections while watching two people in my little pony costumes double team a group of midgets puking in a bucket.
"
444,"That's because the dating climate for men is ""prove your worth"" and the dating climate for women is ""prove his worth"". Generally speaking."
445,"Usually when I feel a sudden attraction to a girl that usually wouldn't be my type physically, it's because of this look they get in their eyes. It's kind of like the bedroom eyes, but it's a lot less sexual in nature. Sort of this mischievous glint crossed with a benevolent earnest. Both inclusive and rebellious all at once. As if she were issuing me a friendly challenge in a way that says ""I don't care if you come through"". It's really hard to describe, but when I see that, I'm instantly more attracted, or at the very least, very intrigued"
446,"A/ Be attractive    
B/ Be interesting    
C/ Follow through. There are whole pages of articles along the lines of ""Just because she's nice to you doesn't mean she wants your dick"". So if you do want it, be clear about it.     
D/ How often do you reject peoples approaching you for whatever reason ? Same goes for men. "
447,I'll take a short amount of pain for long term peace of mind any day.
448,"Where I'm from, (SE QLD) it'd be ""Cunt, quit being so seedy to chicks aye."""
449,It has happened a few times but I have almost always immediately stopped dating those girls. A few of them even openly stated that *it is good to finally have a guy to take care of the bill again*. Sad little shits.

452,The entire term rapeculture originates from a documentary about men getting raped.
453,"You just inspired me to check out Fetlife.

I was just browsing the local area on it and stumbled across my work crush in some very skimpy clothes.

Brb."
454,I do. Mine is hot af
455,"I've been asked what my parents do for a living in an interview.  Probably not legal, but do you really want to bring up the legality of personal inquiries while you are trying to land a career position?  You roll with it, or move on to a new company.  "
