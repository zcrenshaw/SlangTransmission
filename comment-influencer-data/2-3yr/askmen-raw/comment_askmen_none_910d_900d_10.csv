1,"In my country, men are conscripted into the army. Saw this on a live TV.

Interviewer: What do you think of the men serving the army?

Woman: It's a wonderful chance for boys to become men, for them to experience leadership, and learn many important life skills.

Interviewer: What if women are conscripted as well?

Woman: Hell no!"
2,"Please, I need all the help I can get."
3,"This isn't true across the board, but I've experienced it with multiple girlfriends and friends who are girls:

When you're getting ready to go somewhere, or leave somewhere, and you ask them ""How much more time do you need?"" instead of replying with a number, which is what was asked for, they'll instead reply with a list of the things they need to do before they're ready.

For example:

""How much time until you're ready to go?""

""I just have to pick out a top, put on some makeup and decide which shoes I'm going to wear, then I'm ready to go.""

This is an answer to a completely different question than the one I asked.  I have no idea how much time any of that takes, I want to know how much more hockey I can watch before I have to slap on pants, a shirt and shoes.  Just give me a number!!!"
4,"Walking home after work minding my own business, guy follows me down alley, my pace quickens, so does his, soon we are both jogging, sprinting. Out of breath I stop and fall to my knees. He stands in front of me, ""What do you want? Please tell me!"" I plead. He grabs me by the lapels and hauls me up to look me in the eyes.

 ""Rate how I look"", he whispers, ""Using a scale of one to ten"".

 ""Eight!Eight!"" I yammer, not wanting to offend him by rating too low or make him think I'm lying by rating too high. 

""My profile has professional shots....."", he continues. "
5,Get good at eating them out and you won't have to ask.
6,"My wife, my daughter, my three sisters, and nearly every woman I've dated all have the following quirk.

I know from decades of experience that I need 25 minutes in the morning to comfortably prepare myself for the day. In that time I wake up, go to the bathroom, shower, shave, dry off, get dressed, brush my hair and teeth, put my shoes on, get my EDC and I'm ready to go. It doesn't matter what time I wake up or what time I need to leave the house; my routine consistently takes 25 minutes.

Wife, Daughter, Sisters, etc needs {x} amount of time to perform their respective morning rituals, where {x} is equal to the amount of time between waking up and when they need to leave the house to be on time, plus five minutes. The value of {x} is *completely* variable.

For example, let's say Wife needs to leave the house at 8:30am. If Wife gets up at 7:30am, then Wife needs 65 minutes to complete her morning routine (7:30am-8:30am = 60 minutes, plus 5 minutes = 65 minutes). However, if Wife gets up at 7am, then wife needs 95 minutes to complete her morning routine. Similarly, if Wife wakes up late — say, 8am — then wife needs only 35 minutes to complete her morning routine.

The truly odd part is, no matter what value {x} turns out to be the amount of steps required to complete the morning routine doesn't change, and there is no difference in quality control. If Wife needs 35 minutes or 95 minutes, when she's done she looks exactly the same and is equally clean and coiffed and made-up. She's not skipping any steps or anything like that.

And it's not just an ""in the morning"" thing either. If we're going out to dinner on a weekend and we need to leave the house at 6pm, it doesn't matter if she starts getting ready at 3pm or 5:30pm. The {x} factor will still come into play and she'll need 185 minutes or 35 minutes, respectively.

I have yet to meet a man who has the same quirk.

What. The. Fuck.

7,"""Hey she's pretty, oh I need to smile real big right now because everyone is watching me to see my face about how I react, oh great I can't wait to hear about their opinions about that, hey I'm actually marrying her this is cool"".

More or less. And I was correct: people immediately felt the need to tell me how sweet it was that I looked so happy, that they could tell there was nothing else in the world for me at that moment except her, etc. Sorry people; I was thinking about how you're going to be evaluating my reactions. "
8,"When I do something wrong in their dreams and they wake up mad at me and stay mad at me. WTF?

26,"Honestly not sure if I am or ever was ugly, but I started shaving, take more showers, and change my pillow cases more often to keep my face clean. Also started getting haircuts more often to keep my hair looking nicer. Even though I'm not overweight, very little of my weight is muscle so I cut back on calories, once I lose enough I'll stop cutting and try to put more muscle on. Seems to be working well, I think I look better so far."
27,"It just is usually very low-grade cheese I guess. And its tossed with cellulose (powdered saw dust) to prevent clumping. She was advocating for grating cheese fresh as you need it. But then again she was manager of a cheese store.

36,"My SO and I use one all the time and it's awesome.

She has more orgasms, which is fucking hot. 
Feeling her orgasm when I'm inside her is fucking hot. 
Often she will slide the vibrator up and down my cock in time with my thrusting, which is fucking hot.

Watching her gorgeous body twitch and arch while she has an orgasm is fucking hot, especially when I am able to keep thrusting and intensify her orgasm, which is fucking hotter.

Tl;Dr It's fucking hot."
37,"seeing everything that's normal to them as somehow better for no reason. 

Actual conversation I've had:

Girl:Why are men so afraid of being seen with handbags or purses ? 


Me: well first of all there is a stigma , but they don't seem practical either. 


Girl: what do you mean ? all your stuff fits in there 


Me: we have pockets for that too , why bother with a bag? And if we need to carry more backpacks keep your hands free. 


Girl: but that isn't fashionable 


me: what ? listen if it's not in fashion for men to have handbags as apparently you never see them out and about like that how would it be unfashionable to not have a handbag ? 


Girl : Whatever, you don't get it.  "
38,"That if a guy wants to have sex with a girl, it means he *only* wants to have sex with her.  The fact that a guy wants to have sex doesn't automatically negate everything else that happened in the friendship or relationship.

Certainly there are *some* guys who only want sex and are willing to fake an entire relationship or friendship to get it, but it's far from being everyone."
39,Acting like being feminine is the same as being weak and helpless. 
40,Think that her cooling off sexually cannot possibly cause him to cool off romantically.
41,"Holy shit, she's way out of my league"
42,Ok cool thank you. A guy i was seeing was really mean to me about it today and i feel insecure about myself now. I dont want the next guy i see to think it has anything to do with them.. i just cant cum through penetration alone :(
43,"Let their hair clog up the drain and not bother to pull that wet, rat-sized clump out afterwards. I personally comb out my hair when I'm shampooing/conditioning and just kind of stick it on the wall, then when I'm done I roll it all up into a ball, which sounds gross but is actually kind of satisfying in itself, and throw it in the trash. 

Also, women that flush tampons. STOP. JUST. DON'T. "

47,"Or, when you're taking a nice relaxing shit you hear ""I need a pee"" from outside. Okay, well, hold on I'll be a few minutes.

""I'VE GOTTA FUCKIN' PEE""... well, shit, how about going sooner next time? Your I-need-a-piss meter goes from needing a piss to wetting yourself in two minutes?! Do some fuckin' kegels!"
48,"All the time. Sometimes I overreact if I run away with my emotions, so I generally take a couple deep breaths, press it down, and unless it still bothers me later, I just let it go. Not all fights are worth fighting."
49,"I wan't the body shape of The Rock, scaled down to a 5' 8"" guy.

51,Glass animals or the xx. Pure love making music
52,"A lot of women are kind of inconsiderate in public spaces, I've noticed. A few examples:

- Walking slowly in groups down the sidewalk.

- Standing right in front of doorways or cash registers while they search for their keys, phone, or whatever.

- Talking loudly and, often, angrily on the phone. No one needs to know about your drama.

- Never holding the door for others.

- Taking forever and a day to back out of parking spaces.

- Spritzing perfume in the office."

My profile has professional shots that I feel great about and a pretty concise and I'll even say witty bio. I also live in a metropolitan area which allows a veritable sea of people to match with. I typically burn out my allotted free matches every single day and never got the bottom of the pool.

64,"Fortunately for you I have a vintage 1898 copy of Miss Manners' Ladies' and Gentlemen's Guide to the Etiquette of Appropriate Recourses for Social Misdemeanors.  It's a comprehensive guide to social etiquette in these situations.  I looked up this particular offense, and it offers this response:

*You, the aggrieved, should in this case befriend a company of local vagrants with a purse of money and a generous offer of the strong, inexpensive drink that is highly valued by street tramps, prostitutes and Irishmen.  Entice them thereby and secure an agreement with them that they will approach the offending villain's carriage under cover of darkness, and, after establishing that the street is unobserved by the constabulary, have the use of it for the making of their nightly toilet.  Let it be known to them that, upon the dawn, they will be visited by further gifts of coin and spirits, if they have been thorough in their desecration of the vehicle.  Pen an inscription and deposit it upon the wheel-housing of the carriage, informing the cur of his offense, and that should he dishonor himself again, your grace and gentlemanly restraint will be most taxed, leaving you no choice but to visit more indelicate recriminations upon his carriage.  Close your notice with an invitation for him to dine upon his mother's rancid quim, that being the ignominious point-of-departure for his sordid existence.*"
65,"So, I've had quite a few partners and hookups over the years, and at some point before hooking up, almost every girl will say something like ""I'm not that kind of girl"" or ""I don't want you to think I'm easy, "" including women that later became long term SOs.

At first I used to take it seriously. I'd back off, get a number and inevitably, never hear from her again. It was only after years of this happening like, twenty times, that I realised I was supposed to just ignore it, and just keep pushing for sex. It still feels wrong to me though. And it creates a terrible precedent when men feel that they are *supposed* to ignore what women say. Where does it end? How do you know when playful shyness ends and discomfort begins? Someone will say that there are ""subtle signs,"" but let's be honest: no one is spotting you're subtle signs in a dark and noisy club 8 drinks down. 

I don't really mind if people aren't interested in me: I'm a man so I'm used to rejection. But it drives me crazy how comfortable women are at putting me into ambiguous situations where misunderstandings are almost inevitable."
66,I've never had a match. I've been swiping for almost 3 years.
67,"So, I had known this girl for... eight years. Good friends. Realised damn, I loved her. So, waited 3 days, then straight out called her, did the ""proclaim feelings"" thing that they tell you never to do.

She took a day to take it in, and was like ""sure, lets have a realationship, I was meaning to talk next time I was down.""

That was some 16 months ago. We're going strong, despite the distance."
68,"""I really hope she doesn't trip coming down those stairs..."" "
69,"&gt; When I do something wrong in their dreams and they wake up mad at me and stay mad at me. WTF?

Reminds me of an episode of *Adventures of Jimmy Neutron* where, in Carl's dream, Jimmy kisses Cindy. Shortly afterward in real life, Cindy marches up to Jimmy and slaps him, saying ""Not even in *his* (Carl's) dreams, Nerdtron!"" Then she wipes her lips in disgust."

77,"For how bad they keep telling me beauty standards are, they sure do love talking about beauty all the time. 

Also women shouldn't be judged for their beauty but they insist that every woman is beautiful.

So many ways that's bullshit. First of all, no, not all women or men for that matter are beautiful. Saying won't change the fact that they aren't. Saying it won't change the fact that people will treat them differently. They aren't stupid, they realize it. And if you keep perpetuating this ""everyone is beautiful"" bullshit I can't help feel that you'll do everything it takes to actually be beautiful to fit this mold everyone seems to fit.

How about, ""not everyone is beautiful, and that's OK, because there is a whole lot more to you than how you look"""

Or try to guilt me into going rafting with her, even though I can't swim.

I guess it's fortunate that I grew up with a mentally ill/manipulative parent. I can spot that shit a mile off, and I had none of it. Eventually, I got sick of it and just dumped her. That was 7 months in.

It serves as an ego boost for me sometimes when I match with a girl I'd consider a total hottie - then get humbled when she doesn't reply to my opening message. My belief is a lot of women are just there for attention but don't actually have any interest in meeting dudes. "

They put up a front, say that they wont have sex, and wont do anything to escalate to sex, but they will go along with it if you take the lead. That way they can have fun doing slutty things without admitting that they actively made it happen.

My dad explained this to me when i was a teenager and gave me some tips (thank god that he did because it always confused me). when he was growing up, he had to have some solid pretenses and a plan to take a girl home. To enable a girl to split off from her group of friends to go off with you, you had to offer a non-sexual pretense like ""hes going to show me this other bar/club/taco stand"" or ""we are going to go meet up with another friend"". Or when you ask her to come to your place, always have a pretense ready like ""ive got this kickass aged whiskey youve gotta try at my place"" or ""come meet my new kitten at my place!"" 

Without pretenses, the girl is pretty much openly admitting to everyone around that she wants to split and fuck you, and most girls wont do that, even in this age. You have to create an option where she can honestly say to herself and others ""one thing lead to another and it just happened! I didnt do anything! Darn these players and their tricksy ways!""

I dont like it either. I dont like the fact that im way more successful with women when i ignore what they say about their intentions."

142,"I was once a bit of a 'nice guy'

It really came from a complete misunderstanding about what romantic relationships are and how they form.  

I used to think that there was no difference between romantic relationships and normal friendships.  That romantic relationships were just a deeper evolution of a friendship.  That if the friendship became so strong that romance would be the next step.  See every 80s teen movie ever.

I felt that the people who were forward and sexually aggressive were assholes trying to bypass the important friendship step.  Trying to trick women into thinking they were friends when clearly they had only one thing in mind (which is its own form of sexism of course, as if women couldn't see through this).  

I finally started to understand how wrong I was when I heard women refer to 'nice guys' as liars.  As being dishonest.  That was shocking to me.  I thought I was the honest one.  I wasn't pretending to be someone's friend.  Chad Thundercock was!  I really wanted to be their friend...  AND more.  I was going about it the 'honest' way.  I wasn't trying to trick anybody, and I wasn't doing it for sex.  I was doing it for a *relationship!*.  I wanted whatever would evolve to be *real* as opposed to just physical.  I still get very little out of purely physical relationships.  

But you can't argue with what they were saying.  They viewed being nice and friendly as deceitful.  Eventually I began to understand why:  Because you never told them you wanted a romantic relationship.  I thought I was, I thought it was something that organically grew from a friendship, but that's nonsense.  They are two completely different kinds of relationships and you **must** let people know which one you're interested in right off the bat.  THAT'S how you avoid being a nice guy.  Flirt.  Make it known that sex is on the table.  Maybe not today, maybe not for a long time, but plant the seed.  Make it explicitly known that you're in this for more than just being friends.  Because romantic relationships are different.  They require the spark to be there right from the beginning.  You need to make it known what it is you're looking for.  

Reddit gets a hard on for attacking the mentality but from what I've seen they like to take the most obnoxious example and paint it as every case.  Yes there are ""nice guys"" that are really using being friendly as a way to cosy up to women with the expectation of sex.  That was never my problem.  I never *expected* anything.  I just hoped that the friendship would deepen to the point of romance and when it never did I blamed myself.  ""I must not be that desirable if I can never take that next step"".  I find this more often the case.  Nice guys are **wrong** and have only themselves to blame, but more often than not they aren't malicious m'lady basement dwellers.  They just don't understand the fundamental aspects of actual romantic relationships.

Make it explicit.  Leave no doubt."

146,"Glasses frames. Brands that everyone knows are like RayBan, Oakley, Nike, Coach, and pretty much almost all frames from designer lines. These frames are mostly made by companies called Luxottica and Marchon. 

Now, if you want the actual better quality ones, Silhouette (made in Austria), Lafont (made in France), ProDesign Denmark (made in Japan, designed in Denmark) are among excellent brands that aren't several thousand dollars for frames. There are many other frame companies out there that make excellent quality frames. I just don't have them all memorized. But there are many I'd recognize and have heard of that colleagues carry or I've seen at trade shows. 

I prefer the good quality lesser known brands personally. "
147,"It's something I wanted to try for a long time, and got really turned on imagining, both doing and having it done to me. I never thought I would get a chance though, because my wife had made it very clear she wasn't interested in anything butt related. She also wasn't really into me going down on her at all, so I was more interested in helping her get comfortable with that, anyway.  

However, with some patience and not pressuring on my part, she became more and more comfortable with doing some different things in the bedroom. One night, she was on her hands and knees and I started going down on her. I made a few moves closer to the back door, and she didn't make any moves to indicate she wasn't enjoying it, so I went for it. She only let me have a few licks before pulling away and telling me she needed me to fuck her, but she moaned when I did it, and definitely didn't tell me not to do it again.  

Then, a few nights later, we were going again, and she asked me if I could play with her, ""back there,"" and we discovered she is really, really into pretty much all things anal. That was about 6 months ago, and our sex life has never been so good. I even got to experience my ass getting eaten a couple of times so far, and she told me she's embarrassed by how much she enjoyed doing that.  

I would say the most important thing is to not pressure someone into something they're not comfortable with, and do everything in your power not to make the experience unpleasant for either partner. When it comes to butt stuff, this means, most importantly, make sure everything is very clean before any type of action, but a shower with a actual scrubbing should be enough to do the trick. But don't believe those videos on the internet that show people putting things into butts and then into mouths, that's a good recipe for a pretty nasty illness."

155,"3 things.  Well, one leading into the other.  the third one is slightly unrelated. 

First this latest fad of crazy possessiveness dressed as humor that I've been seeing on my timeline more and more.  Going through your significant other's phone, threats of violence, and constant interrogations  were scary back in my day. Now it's hilarious apparently. 

Which leads me to the second thing, abuse not being called abuse. If your significant other makes you feel on edge around them it's not normal. If your friend is constantly flinching when they bring their spouse around help them. Shit isn't funny. Shit isn't quirky. Keep your gotdamn hands to yourself. Watch your words. There's a line between taking the piss and verbal abuse. 

Lastly, insecurity has become a cardinal sin that appears through immaculate conception. When someone is insecure, certain subs and certain people tend to tell that person to ""just get over it"". No questions as to whether the insecurity stems from intrusive thoughts or something that their significant other is doing. For fucks sake, look at the term. ***SIGNIFICANT*** other. If you can't confide in that person what makes them so damn significant? Maybe, just maybe, they may be able to say or do something to help. "

* ""Have you ever fantasized about any of my friends?""

* ""What do you think is my biggest flaw?""

* ""If you could change one thing about me, what would it be?""

* ""Did you ever want to break up with me but then decided not to?""

I think it exposes a larger problem though, I would see myself as sexually incompatible with that person.  Maybe that speaks to my own insecurities but it would just make me feel inadequate after a while.  I wouldn't stop you from doing it, but it would be disappointing from my own personal perspective.  I don't think that's selfish, it's more like a confirmation of that inadequacy.

Overall my feeling is my wife can do what she wants and I can do what I want provided it isn't encroaching on other aspects of our relationship. So if my wife says ""oh I'm hanging out with a friend from grad school"", no problem. But if there's a trend of that kind of thing, and it was messing with other stuff, like ""oh could you watch the baby tonight again? Don't wait up I'll be home late"" that would be a concern. And I would get a bit concerned regardless if she was spending a lot of intentional one to one time with a guy. 

In your case, you're not really obligated to change your behavior. I would just say it would be a bit dickish if you were flirting with her, or encouraging her to complain about her bf, or insisting she hang out with you when she says she needs to get home. Doesn't sound like you're doing that though. "

While some situations do lend themselves to people being judged mainly on looks (Tinder, clubs), men that are 'ugly', but who have other redeeming qualities, can still do well for themselves if they put themselves in situations where their good qualities can show through.  If you can never work up the nerve to have a conversation with a girl, she'll never have the chance to be impressed by your intelligence, or to enjoy your sense of humor, or to appreciate your kindness.  It sounds like you aren't in a headspace where you're capable of that right now.

Also, you just called yourself a piece of shit, which bespeaks a serious lack of positive self-image.  Positive self-image is important, because you can't bullshit yourself.  Before you can impress others as someone who seems interesting and worthwhile, you need to see YOURSELF as someone who is interesting and worthwhile.  So, basically, you need to go out there and live.  Practice your hobbies.  Find the job you're meant to be doing.  Go travel and have interesting experiences.  (And, of course, clean up and see to your appearance, if you believe doing so will give you more confidence) Find the things you WANT to do, and do them, rather than just doing whatever to fill up your time.  The goal is to ask yourself 'if I met me, as another guy, would I think that guy was likeable and interesting?' and be able to honestly say 'yes'.  That's self-respect.  If you have it, you'll meet someone.  If you don't, you'll have a hell of a time, because self-loathing isn't sexy."

If someone told me they were going through this, I'd tell them to knock it off, because it's not grounded in reality. Simmering in dopamine isn't worth it.

Confidence is the key.  And yes I was the poster boy for ""How can I be confident if it's never worked before?""  but that's getting it all wrong.  Confidence isn't knowing what you're trying is going to work. Confidence is knowing you'll be okay if it doesn't.  "

234,"This sounds logical.

What exactly are women supposed to do? You're a woman. You don't want to be 35 and begging some guy to marry you and start making babies right away. So, at a much younger age you *have* to have these conversations with the guy you are dating. You *have* to be willing to cut your losses and move on if he doesn't step up and be the man you are looking for. 

I'm a bit older, and nothing is sadder than the ""nice girl"" who dated a guy for all of her child bearing years as he postponed the conversation and side stepped it, and said ""Yeah yeah babe, I swear I'll be ready next year .. "" and she doesn't want to ""pressure"" him, she wants to be the ""cool girlfriend who isn't desperate for marriage and kids"". 

Guess how the ""nice girls"" end up? No marriage, no kids, nothing like the future they wanted, they end up being the desperate 35yo woman they never wanted to be. Even worse is that guys will say shit like ""oh she must have been fucking a million guys in her 20s, no wonder she ended up alone!"" and it's like nope. . just one guy. She just didn't want to be the ""meanie girl"" who actually tried to have an adult conversation with her adult boyfriend. 

The women who cut their losses and moved on after a year or so when the guy was still sort of like ""ah, yeah babe, not ready for that conversation yet, maybe try next year?"" are the ones who eventually end up in the relationship they want to be in. 

It's logical. It just makes sense.

A lot of the criticisms of women in this sub (not OP specifically, but other threads) seem to be ""If a woman dares to directly address her desire for commitment, marriage, or family at any point, she's a desperate hag."" quickly followed by ""Dammit why are women always hinting and suggesting  . why don't they just say what they want!?"" Damned if you do, damned if you don't. "

Then, one day she just showed up at my door with some of my things and said she was moving to Baltimore. And so she was gone. A few monthly later she came home for a visit and I got one of the few booty calls I've ever received in my life. Now she is really gone, living in Baltimore with a serious boyfriend and I am engaged to be married to an amazing woman. We never ""fell in love"", but we both loved to fuck each other and sometimes... sometimes that's enough. In this situation, I am thankful that I was aware that this good thing had come to an end and I was able to just let it go. I am happy knowing that I was not a chain that bound nor anchor that weighed, instead, I was a dependable throbbing rod that was prepared to deliver the goods when that woman needed it. ""Backdoor Man"" will never be the same, thanks to you."

249,"I say kinda sorta for a couple reasons. 1: I was physically bigger and stronger so I had the power to stop it, just didn't. 2: It wasn't bad, in fact I kind of enjoyed it after we got started, it's just that I clearly said no beforehand but she did it anyway. And 3: I don't really like the idea of me being a victim and it's ultimately up to me whether I want to consider what happened rape. If I decide I wasn't, I wasn't, end of story. I just haven't really figured out how I feel about it.

What happened was we matched on tinder, talked a bit and it was clear she was kinky. Short, dark, sexy Muslim girl with an overbearing religious father. We traded numbers and in the first ten seconds of our first phone call she just started masturbating and told me to have phone sex with her. I was, like, kinda just trying to get to know her but momma didn't raise no bitch so I talked dirty while she got off. It was honestly too bizarre and sudden for me at first, but I got into it after a while. 

We had our date, which was (no shit, her idea) at her favorite sex toy shop. We browsed dildos and butt plugs while she regaled me with stories about her favorite kinks. I asked her about school and work and what she wants to do and it became clear that she had no ambitions or hobbies other than getting herself off. I was really not into her. No car, no job, never applied for college, lived with her parents, just a boring, uninspired person.

We end up going to my place where I quickly realize she's going to pressure me into sex, but I figure I'll feel it out and see if I'm into it, who knows. We immediately start making out, it's kinda hot, and she tells me she's on her period but it's no big deal, she'll just blow me. For the record, I have never once turned down a blowjob so she kinda got me on a technicality there, otherwise I really would have told her I wasn't feeling it.

So anyway she blows me for, like, twenty seconds, then she's like okay this is too much, I have to fuck you. And I'm like nahh this is getting kinda weird. She says obviously I'm into it or my dick wouldn't be in her mouth, if I wasn't into it why would I have an erection? I tell her it's just moving kinda fast, I really just think we should get to know each other better first. And she hits me with the old, what are you gay? Don't be a faggot. 

I'm kinda stunned, little affronted, but like wtf I'm clearly not gay. In my moment of confusion she already has her panties off and starts climbing on top of me. I tell her look dude we're not doing this, I told you no. And she doesn't stop, she just says whatever dude you'll like it once we start. And she literally just hops right on like it's no biggy.

I could have shoved her off, but like my sexuality was in question here and it was kind of already in, seemed kinda pointless to fight it at that point. The only thing was that she really was on her period, on my sheets, on my bed and she had a pretty heavy flow. She was right of course, once I got over the whole non-consensual thing I got really into it and basically did my best to destroy her guts. I was kinda mad at that point so I channeled my anger directly at her vagina. Made it look like a murder scene on my bed. My revenge kind of backfired because she loved every bit of it, but I decided to just make it about me getting my rocks off so I didn't really care.

My real revenge came later. She called me like every day for weeks after that and I kept telling her I wasn't feeling it, I had other stuff to do, I was hanging out with other girls, didn't have time. Stuff like that. Gave her just enough reciprocation to string her along. She was some kind of weird control freak so it bugged the shit out of her that I wasn't doing what she wanted. At one point she made me download this messaging app that gives ""read"" receipts so she'd know exactly when I read her messages, obviously so she could badger me about not replying. I told her the app seemed pointless so I deleted it, and of course she exploded. She insisted that I was fucking every other girl in my life, which I wasn't, but I told her I might be and I reserved the right to because we weren't exclusive. Eventually she realized what I was doing and said if I didn't come fuck her that very night we were through. I was like what are you talking about? We never started. Haven't heard from her since.

In the UK, there is no such thing as an ""exclusivity"" talk or a ""where is this going"" talk because exclusivity is more the norm than the exception, so there is such a thing as a ""non-exclusivity"" talk instead. You don't really expect that people are dating multiple people at once because it's a cultural rarity. Not that it doesn't happen, but it's just not so much of an expected thing.

Also, there are no such things as ""milestones"" particularly - things unfold as they unfold. I think we have a bit more of a relaxed attitude to dating. And in fact, ""dating"" itself is a bit of an American word. We don't really have a ""dating scene"" as such. You meet people and if you like them you go out with them a bit and get to know each other and you expect that they're probably only doing that with you at the moment and you just find out whether or not you're really compatible. There's no ""making it official"" either. You call each other bf/gf when ever that feels natural. I guess it's more fluid and less about ""bagging the guy"" (or girl or whatever) and more about just getting to know each other.

Oh also...I don't know if this actually a thing....but chatting women up. Yeah, if you're in the UK probably don't do that. There isn't a culture where the girls get ""chatted up"" (except by arseholes). You just talk to each other.

And the obvious: Women and men are equal in the dating world here. There is no buying stuff for women - like paying for dates. It's considered at best odd here if you do that and at worst controlling.

I'm used to what I'm used to and maybe that's why, but I think the American system sounds stressful."

This is the part that makes me question whether you are being completely honest with yourself about the matter.

333,"I'm going to start this out with lets just say the way she acts has earned her the nickname ""princess"" between me and my friend and we may have joked about sending her a link to an ""adult school"" (ie a ""school"" that teaches people how to be an adult and do things like cook or do taxes). I might update this in a bit but from the top of my head: 

- Obviously if a girl is talking to a guy, especially at a party, she is obviously flirting with him

- Obviously if you want a cute guy to talk to you at the coffee shop, you just need to stand there and look pretty (this might be reason for the makeup idea?). Or maybe it is more of you need to have your hair and makeup all done up and hope a cute guy will talk to you.

- Other general, guy must make the first move/initiate. I think there were a few times she was on tinder and complaining about some guy not talking to her and it's like ""why not say hi to him first?"". Bonus, then she complains if the guy on tinder does a ""lazy"" opening like ""hey, hows it going?"".

- Pretty much, people are supposed to be mind readers and know when and what to say to her. Occasionally she might be in a poor mood and anything you say that is remotely a ""bad topic"" will cause her to get even more upset. Most recently it was my friend talking to her about going to a vegan restaurant in NYC and she immediately thought we only went there because we were visiting other friends (one of which is her ex) and the Ex's GF is vegan. He had made no mention of who went to the restaurant, just that he went to a vegan tapas place in NYC that was good.

- Your SO should always make sure they spend time with you, even if they are busy and stressed with work. This almost sounds reasonable, but she never really put that much effort into relationships or compromises. When she dated a different friend/roommate I think she visited our apartment like 3 times in the 9 months they dated, else he always was the one who had to go to her apartment to sleep over and would get kind of bitchy if he was too tired to do that. 

- Someone obviously doesn't know how to apply makeup unless it follows the current trend/what she thinks is ""correct"". 

- To care for your hair, you need like 3 different types of brushes, 5 different products and masks and who knows what else at the minimum. Similar sort of thing with skin. I'm all for people doing whatever they thing is best for their hair and skin, it is more the ""you must do X"" mentality that is WTF

There are a lot more other things that she does that are WTF, but those are more specific to her and I already feel like I'm kind of just ranting about her at this point instead of weird little WTF rules."
334,"I hate being asked leading questions so that she hopes I arrive at the conclusion she wants without her simply asking for the thing from the top

Example:  both of us in the car

Her: Are you cold?

Me: no, not really.

Her: ok

[12.63 seconds elapse]

Her: because I'm cold, can we turn the heat on?

Me: no, because you were indirect.  Next time start with ""I'm cold can we turn the heat on"" and we'll go from there"

341,"I can only speak for myself but most of the time stuff moves real slow down there, and even when it doesn't I often feel like I have more to go so I just sit there for a while on my phone."
342,"I think I might be able to answer this for you. I don't usually want to be the chick that expects everybody else to hold doors open, so I always try to get there first and do it. Most men will then take the door and insist that I go in first even if I had been holding it and did the ""hand wave"" for them to go in. I prefer to keep to myself when I'm out and about and thus just increases the odds that someone will want to strike up a conversation if I prolong the door dance, so I just thank them and go in to keep it to a minimum. On days when I'm particularly rushed or stressed our standoffish, I avoid racing to get there first and actually slow down if a man is nearby so they can open the door, and I'll just thank them and go through to avoid the door dance entirely. I imagine that the women who never hold doors open are the ones who just never want to bother with the door dance, and I can't say I blame them. It's a self-perpetuating problem. Men aren't used to having women hold doors open so they often turn it into this big annoying dance/event when they do, and women continue not to hold doors open because they don't want to bother with that."

I remember the heartache of having to leave each other and sneak back in to a cold empty bed, feeling an almost physical hunger for  just a few more moments in each other's arms. We used to both drive way out of the way between work or church or etc just to meet behind a Walmart to sneak a kiss and just breathe each other in. He used to drive 3hrs roundtrip nightly to meet me in the tree house across the street from my parents house so we could curl up under a blanket and sleep for a few hours...

350,"Some women need more than the male anatomy can provide.  My small sampling of lovers has run the gamut from one who occasionally came just from prolonged kissing, to one who couldn't come during intercourse except by furiously rubbing her clit or using a vibrator.

It's not about you.  If your lady needs her own hands or a toy to get there, how you can ""be man enough"" is to be secure in your shit and roll with whatever she needs to get her O on."

I also remember that when I was applying for jobs straight out of college and getting ZERO response, their perception was that I was simply not applying at all. Like they could not fathom that nobody was hiring much in the middle of a recession when everyone was *losing* their jobs.

My dad in particular doesn't seem to understand that at most jobs I've had, I haven't been in a position to make demands of my employer. When he found how much I made or how many hours I worked, he always had this attitude that I should just storm up to my boss and DEMAND a raise/more hours...at some part-time job where I was easily replaceable. In the same vein, this partly stemmed from him not understanding just how low the minimum wage was compared to cost of living. I think he thought they were somehow underpaying me, when really sometimes I was getting paid a little more than the minimum.

In recent years this has been changing, as now his own employer has slowly stripped away benefits he took for granted and he's dealing with a lot of the same stuff I am. "

But remember also you can bank this. Being this kind of neighbor, I love doing this sort of thing, but even better if you make him a big pot of chicken soup six months from now when he has the flu, or take in his mail when he goes on vacation. 

To me, the best way to handle this is like a bit of a stalker, you look for opportunities to reciprocate. Much better than than the direct response. That makes it almost transactional. The goal is to strengthen your community.

451,"&gt; Lastly, insecurity has become a cardinal sin that appears through immaculate conception. When someone is insecure, certain subs and certain people tend to tell that person to ""just get over it"".

Not to mention the word insecurity itself is used as a cudgel to shame and silence any man who is frustrated at society. I see this all the time with short guys in the dating scene.

""My dating life is awful and I think being 5'2'' has something to do with it.""

""*No it doesn't. I know a guy who was short and pulled game. Ergo ipso facto, you're a whiny manbaby who doesn't know shit.*""

""But that's just one example... and I've seen girls list on their Tinder profiles they only want guys 6' and higher... and at bars my taller equally attractive friends get so much more attention... and I've read studies saying short guys are paid less than tall guys...""

""*No, no, no. It's all in your head. You know what the real problem is? It's not you height - it's your INSECURITY.*""

483,"I think a big one is the misunderstanding between men and women when it comes to dating and relationships in general. 

Women have the upper hand by a lot. By a whole hell of a lot. Like LeBron James playing a 6 year old in a one on one. 

This causes so many issues I can't even begin to hit them all. Women don't understand the frustrations, anger, and jealousy that can come from it. How men can be just tossed aside because obviously they have multiple other pursuers and it's no big deal. Or to assume that since you are dating around with six different dudes that obviously they are too and there's no need to have that little talk about exclusivity. 

I was blown away when I saw how common this was on reddit and in real life (last five years or so, when online dating really took off). I mean seriously, I would have never known that women will have five plus guys and be simultaneously dating them all. It's just crazy to me, still is, but man. I've also heard this is more of an American thing, but if I'm going on a date with someone it's only that one person. 

And seeing my exes online dating profiles really opened my eyes. Like holy shit, I mean she was pretty and all, but fuck. I would have never guessed the amount of attention a woman gets. When you really get to see this stuff first hand it's shocking. She wasn't model hot either, just an average looking woman. I can't even imagine what it's like for more attractive ones. 

Then you see the opposite. Men and dating is an entirely different ball game. It's all about casting the widest net possible. Matching and talking to hundreds of people every week to maybe, just maybe, get a single coffee date. 

My ex didn't quite understand me when I tried explaining the differences to her, but in the end it seemed to make sense. For a guy/me, they have to put in dozens of hours of pure work to even land a single date with anyone. Not even someone they might be attracted to, literally just another human being. For her/women, the work came from filtering out all the matches/potential partners. 

When you're job hunting would you rather be desperately sending out dozens of resumes a day with barely an interview or even a response, or have dozens of amazing job opportunities offered to you every day and plenty of interviews every week? Which is the better situation? 

"
484,"&gt; How common do you think it is that men would fake a relationship or lie for sex?

I think it depends on how you look at it. I don't think it's very common among men, as in only a small percentage of men behave like this. But I think it's very common for women to encounter. And the reason is that the men who are willing to lie and manipulate for sex are also often aggressive in seeking out women. They approach women at much high rates than other men, so women have disproportionate contact with them. "

Any time the topic of sexual history comes up lots of redditors inevitably talk about *needing* to know sexual history to gauge compatibility, or that one isn't truly comfortable with their partner unless they can discuss it. And hey.. to each their own. But those people who say they have to know their partner's history are often the same people who then post here with threads like ""Reddit, I found out my girlfriend slept with three guys before me and now I want to puke every time I think about it. How can I get over this?""

Well... what did we learn..? "
