1,Nothing says hilarity in bed like pre-memorized lame puns gleaned off reddit.
2,"I met my wife in High School when I was an 18 year old virgin. I am almost 37 now, so I've been with her more than half of my life. We have 3 kids together. Life is pretty good.

But, *yes*, especially during my 20s, I have thought a lot about how it would be/feel to have sex with another woman. Sometimes, I was really frustrated and even let that thought affect me so much that I had bad days or even weeks. 

At first, I didn't say anything, but eventually, I talked to my wife about it. She was understanding. Which is a lot to ask, but doesn't *actually* help. What helps is to make sure you know about the ""grass is greener on the other side""-effect, what helps is making yourself aware of what you *have* and trying to not put too much emphasize on what you *don't* have. 

Sure, we have had our ups and downs during those 18 years, which I think is pretty normal for such a long time and 3 kids, and I admit that especially during ""dry spells"", these thoughts crawl out of the back of my mind again, but in the end I can always say that I married the love of my life, the woman I almost instantly knew I wanted to be the mother of my kids. And that is much more important than having had sex with more than one person."
3,"""Hey, I know that you still want to be friends, but I honestly am not there right now. I'm still in the mind set of wanting to date you. Please respect my feelings enough to give me some time and space to get away from that mentality before trying to be just friends."" 

For the record, you never have to be friends with her, this is just to get her to leave you alone."
4,"Whatever you call the aesthetic that Kylie Jenner sets as the modern ""standard"".  I hate caked makeup, gigantic lips, and whatever else is a component of that look. 

EDIT: Holy smokes, this blew up! Good to know other people feel the same way!"
5,"We'd just got home from dinner with friends.

""I'm all peopled out"", she said.

""Aww, and you still brought one home with you""

""Look, he thinks he's people!"""
6,"I actually have a pretty funny story. I was having sex with my long-distance SO, and we were both excited because we hadn't seen each other in a while. My partner decided to pull out to finish on me. Afterwards he cupped my chin and said, ""I missed you.""

""I missed you, too,"" I say, trying to be romantic too.

He gestures to the mess on the sheets next to me and said, ""No, I *missed* you."" And then he immediately began to crack up."
7,"Not into it. My ex used to do that shit, she was fueled by male attention. She actively did shit like that to cultivate a stable of orbiters who all hoped they were next in line.

People need to get their idealistic comments out of here. Boundaries are awesome, yo."
8,"I have no tips for you but Holy shit how impressed I am with you! This is how you handle a girl of interest! Ask her out and if that doesnt work, move along. No time to be her fanboy. Respekt "
9,Some guy putting too much garlic in the dinner. He had it coming.
10,Girlfriend asked me to put my fingers inside her the other day. I put them up her nose. This did *not* go down well 
11,"In kindergarten, my teacher accused me of cheating because my friend and I (who were sitting next to each other) had gotten the same thing wrong on an activity in class. That was the day I learned of anger and, most importantly, injustice. Still remember it to this day."
12,"""The grass is greener"" effect is a big thing, but you made the right call.  I've had my share of my hookups, but now I'm almost 30, and not even close to finding some one that I want to spend my life with.  I'm not even against the idea of marriage and kids.  As Silent Bob once said, ""You know, there's a million fine looking women in the world, dude. But they don't all bring you lasagna at work."""
13,"We were grocery shopping and split up to tackle the list.  I was done with my items and was looking down each aisle to find her.  I reached the cereal aisle and there she was staring at cereals and dancing, by herself, with nobody else in the aisle.  She was doing like a jazz-hands type thing while shimmying back and forth with a dead-serious look on her face trying to figure out what to buy.  

I had no idea such a creature existed..."
14,"Female here with unsolicited opinion - sorry. 
&gt; I know a lot of girls like this and there is one of two things happening.   Either she's a super nice person and feels bad for rejecting you - her attempts at friendship are her way of trying to smooth over the situation and thinks it will make you feel better. Possibiliy B (and the more likely situation) - that she wants attention and wants to keep a guy around that she knows wants her so she can use you as an ongoing ego boost.    Unfortunately, its most likely the second option - some girls are like this, they love the attention, they love telling their friends how in love with them you are, to make her boyfriend insecure, etc.     If she had any respect for you or her boyfriend she wouldn't be trying to be your best bud, let alone trying this hard.
I imagine her boyfriend would be very unhappy to know that she is trying to become best friends with another guy who has blatantly told her he wants her.    Tell this thot to beat it. She doesn't want to be your friend, she wants an admirer she can keep at arms reach."
15,"The aim of flirting is not to get their number and ask them out. Its to make them laugh and see if you have chemistry. You are going for the number without even establishing if there is chemistry, so of course they are taken back.

You need to start working in more humor, innuendo, being cheeky. Push the boundaries, if they like it keep going, if they cool off you know you're barking up the wrong tree.

16,What's worse? Making up some bullshit which will eventually teach your child that dad tells lies (even if well intentioned) or telling your kid that mom did something bad and had to go to jail?

18,"Red lipstick.

It just makes them look older imo, and not in the good way."
19,This. I've been known to meet my girl for a lunchtime romp half way between our offices. I'm 51.
20,"Mid forties here: You stop giving a shit about it and realize most people just make it up as they go along. 

Everybody's in their own hamster wheel floating on a raging river. You can steer it around a little with effort, but for the most part life's going to hurl you along whether you want to go or not. Might as well enjoy the ride."
21,"Can I answer as a Caribbean creole? I would be called ""black"" in the US.

And essentially I don't. Hiphop isn't a ""black thing"" here (Netherlands), I cannot bring to face a single black rapper. Most are white, a few are North African. Really rappers here mostly seem to rap about video games and [bizarrely enough how orgasmic it is to read the time from the clock.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=887-5bPJnG0) instead of ""Bitchez and Hoez""

Culture is not race bound here, it's ethnicity bound. Most non white people here are either from one or two generations ago, a lot practice the culture of their home country. Black culture in the US is obviously not based upon the culture of whatever place the slaves were reaped 300 years ago. Quite often the second or third generation surrenders the ancestral culture though, typically much to the chagrin of their parents. Especially when they are Moroccan or Chinese.

There's a definite Caribbean culture here from a lot of immigrants but it's not comparable to US black culture at all.

I don't think a lot of countries that aren't the US have such a thing as ""black culture"". It's a common thing amongst South Americans when they come to the US to experience a culture shock of how segregated white and black people are in the US and often that they are suddenly expected to ""be and act black"" for ""not being 100% white"". Most South American countries treat race like a continuum , we typically talk about how dark or pale one is. In the US race is treated like a binary thing where everything in between white and black is grouped into ""black"" which makes it easier for a distinct ""black culture"" to develop.

Edit: One of the things that always fascinated me about the US though is the existence of the ""black voice"", like you can hear someone's race over the phone, fascinating. You can hear ethnicity over the phone here obviously of non-native speakers if they speak with an accent but you can't hear it from the second generation of native speakers. There was this Comedian who refused to treat race as binary who mastered both the 'white voice' and the 'black voice' and it's amazing to see that when he switches to black his voice drops like 2 octaves."
22,"She made me pancakes for breakfast one morning, and tried to ask if I wanted syrup with them. She tripped over the first word, and just kept the sentence going with total gibberish. But I was so used to understanding what she wanted that she was nearly done with the sentence before I realized that she wasn't speaking English. I just knew what she was saying. 
But now she's my ex and she won't tell me why or even look at me. "
23,"Wife referred to Pink Floyd as a ***""him""***."
24,I am 26. I just accept it. We are just chimps trying to collect shinny things 
25,She said The Phantom Menace was the best star wars movie.... 
26,"I was watching TV on the couch and she jumped on me with nothing but panties on and started humping me like an animal as a joke. thats when I knew.

plus we had sex after so yeah."
27,"""If you're depressed because you can't find a job, then you should go backpacking across Europe for six months; you'll feel better when you come back.""


""But...I don't have money.""

28,"Mostly Hasslehoff, right?"
29,"FYI, any guys who married their first sexual partner and have never slept with anyone but her, you should be aware there are ""bachelors"" your age who have had fewer sexual partners than you. #[We're All Virgins]"
30,"Not at all. I've always been told I'm an oreo(black on the outside, white on the inside), because of my mannerisms, way of speech, and likes in music and movies and the such.

So, yeah, not at all. Unless you mean relate in relation to racial discrimination or the like. In that case, mostly no; I spent most of my life before college in Saudi Arabia(I'm sudanese), and I've encountered little(albeit noticeable) racism, maybe because I was privileged, and the environment I was raised and educated in was, well, educated. 

In Sudan where I am now, a country in north Eastern Africa, everyone's black, so yeah."
31,"I've never been attracted to the stereotypical white blonde ""model""-type petite women. They do absolutely nothing for me. "
32,"Height requirements. Doesn't personally bother me, I'm over 6'. But how would she feel if I told her I have a weight requirement?

Also, fuck your devotion to your son. I'm here for hookups. "
33,How bout those fake looking weird eyebrows? I hate that shit. 
34,"I'm against it.  In fact, I don't think I could stay with someone who continued posting that sort of thing after I made it clear I didn't approve."
35,"Asking a girl if you can kiss her (Read it on TwoXChromosomes). According to them it super sexy when a man asks before he goes for kiss. I tried it two girls, the first one said ""You could, but now it is awkward"", and the second one said ""I wouldn't take you home if I didn't want you to kiss me"". 

After these two experiences, I just lean in for kiss (slowly) so the girl has time to reject me if she wants. Most of the time, she has her mouth open before me. "
36,I read an article that said 5 inches was average penis size so I decided to break out the ruler. Worst mistake of my life. 
37,"The reality is that kids are far better at coping than adults give them credit for, especially when given the right support systems.

But to answer your question directly there are too many variables at play to give a really helpful opinion. Was the mother in the childs life already? Were they close? Does she still want to be a part of the childs life moving forward? How serious was the crime and how long is she going away for?

All those things matter because they will help you form a plan on how to deal with this, because eventually you are going to have to tell your kid the truth. What we are really discussing is the best way to do it and how will you support your child emotionally and psychology as they cope with it."
38,"We were making pancakes one morning and I realized we were out of granulated sugar. I suggested asking the couple next door for some, and she started belting out 'Hey Ya!' by Outkast.

""Lend me some sugah, I am your neighbour!"""
39,Hide every single one of my hoodies 
40,This is a great thread to read for maximizing ones loneliness...
41,"Nothing that I can recall, I did start to show my face more often for lack of a better term. I used to always look down when I'd walk, or at my desk in class. I suppose it was confidence and posture that helped, and I got in much better shape from 17 years old onward."
42,"Within the space of about 3 hours went from saying she used to like when I cooked for her more often to complaining because I was frying the sausages with onions. That she bought. Presumably because no kitchen is complete without a decorative bag of chopped onions in the bottom of the freezer or something I DON'T KNOW, IM NOT A FUCKING MARTIAN PSYCHIATRIST."
43,"My wife and I have only been with each other (she was also my first kiss), and I can only speak for myself but I 0 % feel like I'm missing out on anything.

We have a great sex life, and I wouldn't change a thing between us - why would I look back at what could have been?

No sense in eyeballing the Miata next to you when you're driving a BMW"
44,"Man I hope you don't take this wrong, but that's literally the dumbest fucking thing you could have said in that situation."
45,That is gold THANKS! sending her that NOW haha wow
46,"""I'm cumming!""  
""Hi cumming I'm Dad"""
47,"Not a SO but a fuck buddy. He told me he was seriously into pain, like black-out level pain. He loved that it made him feel like an animal. A while back, while out in the woods a stray  bullet went through the outside of his thigh. I asked him a few days later how the wound was healing up. He said it was infected. I asked why and he said it was because he'd jerk off and finger fuck his bullet hole. Haven't hooked up with him since. "
48,Here's a shocking theory: the women who answered the question on Reddit were not the women he went on dates with &amp; kissed.
49,"I went on r/personalfinance when I got my first job out of college, a $50/hour 1 year contract position as a programmer asking what the best investment of the extra money was and what I should be doing. They told me ""you're young and have too much time, go get another job working the night shift, all young people should try bartending'.

Yeah, I'm going to go from my $400 a day programming job to go work at a bar scrounging for tips and fighting over the good weekend shifts. The fuck kind of life do those people live?"
50,"A lot of tattoos. This obviously applies to both men and women and it's not like everyone finds them attractive. I'd be ok with a small one that isn't always noticeable.

Edit: Just to throw it out there my ex actually had a small tattoo on her back. It didn't bother me after a while. It's just that A LOT of them like I said would be a turn off. But I think attraction is more complicated than ""This person has this feature I don't find attractive, therefore I won't date them."" I probably would date another girl with a tattoo if we clicked well."
51,"Marriage will not change your spose for the better. It's not a solution to any problem. 


If there is a mismatch with libido then misery follows. When sex is good it is 25% of the relationship. But when sex is bad it can become 75%."
52,"Go to the gym, enjoy the weight room to myself."
53,"well, that took a turn"
54,The more I workout the less I'm finding the soft skinny look attractive and the more I'm drawn to girls with a toned look with a booty built from deadlifts and hip thrusts.
55,"We were walking up to a building and she began singing and skipping. When we got to the doors she opened one up, ran in and to the one in front of me, and jumped out all while finishing the song. She had the biggest smile on her face and my heart melted."
56,I've been told to do the world a favor and kill myself. That's some poor advice...
57,"Drinking a lot of water can actually help with wrinkles or lines on your face from stress, tiredness, or dehydration. If you're overweight, (unless you're obese), don't for a second think loose shirts are the way to go. Tighter shirts will look much better than you think, especially if you have any muscle. That's all I got from when I used to be fat and look tired "
58,"- Must love dogs

59,"I mean I'm not *extremely* noticed, but women do notice me now, I basically started caring for how I look, my posture (back straight chest out head UP) and I become more confident with experience."
60,"Ukrainian here. No such thing as too much garlic. 


I think killing a person over eating the last piece of whatever in the fridge after you have been thinking about it all day is acceptable. Maybe get time served or community service."
61,"Don't just lie there like a lifeless toy.

Interact with her, be affectionate, be playful, let her know how good it feels. Caress as much of her as you can reach. Grab the sides of her hips and hold her down on you for a moment. Pull her close and give her a big ol' hug. Kiss her and play with her hair. Play with her hands and kiss her hands; or simply hold them for a bit. Let your voice out for her. There's a lot of things to do, there's a living, breathing *woman* on top of you, not a block of ice."
62,"As a Kenyan, I relate to it to the same extent I relate to 17th century Japanese culture. Which means it's completely foreign to me.

Playing with the stereotypes: I've never been shot at, never experienced any gang culture, never been discriminated against, grew up in a rural stable family, etc. Race identity has never been important to me. I am black, but I never feel black.

One thing for sure, I would never want to live in the US (UK yes). I wouldn't fit it in the ""Black Culture"". Black Americans would accuse me of acting white, while White Americans would expect me to play to a stereotype. That's no way to live."
63,"I worked for a law firm when I was like 19. I worked there for about a year and it was the most soul-sucking job I've ever had. My official title was ""Messenger"" but that translated to ""Office Bitch Boy."" The lawyers ignored your existence, the support staff treated you like scum, and my days consisted of doing about 20% of actual work, and 80% personal errands for other people. 

Before and after this job, I always did the right thing buy putting my two weeks in, having a job lined up beforehand, and never burned a bridge. One day I had just had enough and decided to leave. I went to my boss' office and handed over all my shit and simply said ""I'm done."" He was caught off guard and clearly wanted to understand why, but I just walked out of our little office and went up to the 20th floor (We had the 18th through the 21st floor) as I had some business I needed to take care of before actually leaving.

One of the secretaries there became the bane of my existence. She had been there for 30 years, in her 50's but dressed like she was 20. Because she had been there so long (never advancing, never bettering herself), she felt she was afforded some sort of special treatment, and she found that in me. It was painfully obvious that she saw me as *her* assistant as she had me do *everything* for her, regardless of what I had to do from the 60 other people in the office. What made it worse was, since she had been there so long, she had all the top brass in her back pocket, so talking back or giving her shit was essentially a death sentence. 

The office had a very open concept, the secretary's desks lined the halls and the offices for their attorneys were behind them. So standing at any secretary's desk, you could turn in a 360 and see about 6 or 8 other people. I approached this woman's desk and before I could even say a word, she hands be a stack of paper and starts to give me instruction. I dropped the papers on her desk and interrupted her by saying ""No. Fuck your paper and fuck your copy job. You are the biggest cunt I've ever met and I am so glad to be leaving here. And I'm especially glad knowing that as I work to better myself, you'll be stuck here, never moving forward, doing the same shit, until your miserable life comes to a close and you die. Fuck you."" and I walked away feeling incredible.

I don't put that job on my resume.  "
64,"I look down when I walk, but this has nothing to do with confidence.

65,"That's downright inspiring. I'm 28, my 401k can take a backseat to... the backseat. "
66,"Whenever she bottles up with happiness and hypes up with that signature cute smile, not being able to contain it just shaking and giggling with an almost childlike enthusiasm. Also when i kiss her when she's half asleep, she'll seek my mouth almost like a magnet after the first kiss ^^"

Nah honestly, what an odd question? It's never too old so long as you don't break a hip. Have fun."
71,"Copied over my comment from a previous thread 

&gt;I had a girl who wanted me to rape her in a non consensual way.  We would hang out and she would tease me all through the evening and reject every advance i made. There were a few times where she purposefully got herself way too drunk and passed out on the couch with her legs wide open and her panties missing. After that happened for the second time i realized what she was doing. I later talked to her and straight up asked ""Are you purposefully trying to get me drunk and sexually frustrated so that i take advantage of you when you are passed out?"" She then just admitted to it and that is when we stopped hanging out alone.
&gt;
&gt;I could tell that she wasn't trying to get me arrested or anything, this was more like a fetish for her. If this girl would have asked me to do it than i would have done it, but her trying to trick me into it was so incredibly creepy. Idk if she has done that before, but every time i see her i want to go in-depth with her and ask her about this.


That was a big no-no"

The annoying bitch said something annoying as she passed by us, so I responded in kind, and she yelled (annoyingly) from down the hall, ""Fuck you!"" She immediately responded by yelling, ""That's MY job!""

I married her. 29 years this June. "
80,"It doesn't answer your question, but I am so fucking proud of you for standing your ground. You can totally see in her behavior that this is driving her crazy. She wants what she can't have.

To help you keep your wits, realize that her ploy to be friends is her way of keeping you around as a fallback plan. You may have realized this already, but it's worth reinforcing regardless. If need be, you can drop the ultimatum on her, to quote swoozie, ""I ain't nobody's Plan B. You either choose me or you lose me."""
81,"ITT men that think they are the minority when they say they like women who are tall, athletic, don't wear a pound of makeup, don't have tattoos, don't have body jewelry, like to go out, have a good personality, have pale skin, have a natural hair color, not Kylie Jenner.

When people dye their hair, pierce their skin with a needle coated in ink and leave jewelry in their body, it's not to conform to the standard definition of beauty. That is the point. Of course not everyone is going to like that. Especially in a place like Japan, where any form of body art is affiliated with the yakuza and is generally banned or shunned in all public spaces.

Know what I like in my women? Anything. As long as they are happy and love themselves. Who would want to have sex with a bird with a broken wing? I would take care of it, not sexualize it (in this metaphor the bird is not really a bird and the broken wing is not literally a wing, I don't advocate for bestiality calm your downvotes). "
82,"When I was living with an ex, she had a fantasy that she was around 15, 16, and I was her babysitter, aged 35-40s.  I was cool with this, I was SUPER attracted to my girlfriend, we had sex ALL the time, and it was just a fantasy.  We even talked in our roles and all.

She later told me she was actually wishing she was like 7 or 8.  Yep.  My gf was kind of a reverse pedophile.  Totally killed it for me."
83,You held her...like a bowling ball?

85,"I was a preteen and I was having surgery. The surgeon came to meet me and my mom and I really, really impressed him. For whatever reason he bought me a chemistry set and told my mom that he'd pay for me to go to medical school if I wanted to be a doctor. I never even opened the Chem set and I would always blow off meeting with him again.

Now I sit here wishing I'd taken him up on it because I'd love to be a surgeon. "

89,"When I was seven I had a teacher who accused me of not being sick at all the previous day, when I gave her the sick note from my mother. She claimed I had been seen by another student, hanging out in a shopping centre 3 miles away. 

Seven years of age. I'm not sure what she was trying to achieve; either she thought I was the most self-sufficient and devious child on the planet, able to forge flawless sick notes, or my parents were lying about me being sick. And if they were lying, why would she care?

The other student had seen me - the previous weekend. But the teacher obviously got confused.

Still though. After all these years I remain perplexed as to what she was thinking accusing a seven year old of bunking off school. Especially since I was one of the top performers in the class. She was a weird woman."

So I did.  Word of this momentous event quickly made its way throughout the household, and before I knew it, there were 3 very curious pairs of brown eyes peering around the corner,  with my wife looking on.

Reactions were both varied and universally negative:

Wife: Grow it back.  You look like a teenager. You ever cut it off again,  I'm chopping off my hair.

Even getting overly invested in a girl you've just met (or haven't yet met) is a sign that you might benefit from the books I mentioned.

185,"In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good—silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older. On weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale’s or Bergdorf’s and on Evelyn’s advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation. Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it—preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers—which I’ve found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin. Applying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky—which makes it look dull and older—use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing “protective” lotion. A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural-bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb."

202,"Anything involving sex really.

Especially the story of how in high school we went on a school trip to Rome (5 classes of 30 each, together = 150 pupils).

The evenings and nights in the dingy hotel-hostel hybrid can only be described as a gigantic arena of teenage drunkenness and fucking. The teachers immediately hit town every evening to get hosed on Italian red; the one teacher who was supposed to stay behind and supervise us lay on his bed with a few bottles of grappa and sang; those of us who were single spun the bottle on the aisle floors or went to the cheapest bars they could find; and those who were in a relationship fucked their brains out. Many virginities were lost forever those two weeks.

My girlfriend and her best friend had cleverly arranged things so they shared a room, while the best friend's boyfriend and I shared a room in the ""boy's wing"". 

In the evenings, the girlfriend's room, which was farthest from the drunken singing teacher, was the place for us two boys to be. We were all so hot and bothered that several times, my girlfriend and I banged while the other couple went at it in the other bed in the same room; although we're neither exhibitionists by nature, and normally quite private, it didn't bother us. The horniness was simply too great to give a damn, and the other couple being our best friends, we felt safe (for lack of a better word) around them. We didn't even look at them as we were in our own ""bubble"". And from what I gathered, we weren't the only ones for whom logistics beat privacy then and there.

At night, after the perfunctory ""lights out"" round the teachers made, I snuck into my girlfriend's room to spend the night there, while her best friend snuck into my room to spend the night with her boyfriend. It's a good thing the teachers were so utterly hammered because everyone who had a sweetheart was doing that, and on more than one occasion I ran into other people skulking from room to room. 

Almost unbelievably, only one girl ended up pregnant.

"
203,"She would constantly suck me off. I couldn't stop her if I wanted to. Every morning I would wake up to the sound of a blowjob.
It seems like blessing at first, but later it became a bit of an inconvenience especially considering she wanted me to fuck her minimum once a day.

204,"Yea, during the Baywatch phase I masturbated brunettes mostly"
205,"A while ago, I ended up sleeping with a pretty cute girl.  I'm not sure how, we were both wasted.

Anyways we were going at it and it was awesome, but I was suffering from a bad case of whiskey dick.  I lost my erection and the condom actually briefly came off accidentally.  I told her, we stopped immediately, she tells me she's not on the pill.  I didn't think there was that high a chance of pregnancy all things considering, but she was worried and even if it's a tiny chance it would be terrible for both of us.

So I ventured on a 3 AM odyssey to the (apparently second) nearest CVS via Uber.  The driver pulls up, he asks what's up, and in my inebriated state I tell him everything.  He proceeds to reveal way too much information about what he does with his wife, says he wants to help me out.  Dude actually says he'll drive me back for free if I pick him up a water while I'm in there.  I get the Plan B, the water, return to the car and apparently his phone is dead, so I'm navigating.

Turns out super drunk me is not the best navigator.  We spend a good chunk of the last leg of the trip going the wrong way on a 1-way street.  But we don't die.  I make it home, find she's stolen all my blankets, and sleep like shit.  The end.

Not really that great of a story to be honest, but it was weird, and I definitely feel weird telling it to anyone who might know the girl (my friends facebook stalk *relentlessly*)."
206,"I was seeing a younger woman who wanted a live-in slave relationship. We were already having great sex and fun and I knew she was as least as twisted as me so we went for it.

She moved in and from the moment the door closed on our apartment to the moment it opened the next day and we went out for work she was my sex slave.

At the onset it was pretty fun exploring the fantasy. The door would close and she'd immediately disrobe and then do anything I told her to. Every morning she'd wake up before me and give me head until I woke up and told her where I wanted to cum (human alarm clock, best alarm clock), and in general ask for permission before doing anything at all.

As a form of sex play it was insanely great. I'm getting aroused by writing and thinking about it right now. Sharing with someone who's focus is allowing you to ask for anything gets you past your inhibitions and reservations quick and we did quite a bit of grinding out all of my latent fantasies in that month.

The thing is, having a full time slave is exhausting. For sex play? Fantastic! For basics including grooming, cooking, cleaning, reading a book, watching a particular TV channel, etc. it's exhausting.

We were always 'on' in the home and I needed some 'off' time where she could just be natural with me. 

After a month I told her I couldn't keep it up full time and that she should seek out a partner who could. I loved many aspects of what we shared, but needed the time off aspect as well."

So the kid and foreman take about twice as long doing their framing project as they needed because they didn't want to come back and help with the shit stripping job. When they finally did, they just drove by to get coffee, honking and waving at us as they drove by.

An hour later, they come back, with coffees for themselves but not for me or the guy I'm working with. That pisses me off.

""It's not meant to be fucking funny you asshole. Fuck you, I quit.""

I climbed down the ladder, proceeded to dump about three pounds of roofing nails out of my tool belt in front of his truck, grabbed my tools out of the van, tossed anything he owned in, and took off.

Best part is that I had two weeks vacation coming. Got a job that day scraping paint off a house making twice what I was making doing roofing. Plus getting paid because I had my vacation pay coming. 

A week later, I went looking for a job. Got one as a salesman in an air conditioned office within a couple days. 

All in all it worked out great."
214,Yeah I'm really considering it. She's hot as fuck and the sex is amazing but for a serious relationship it's just not what im looking for. I feel like it'd cause me more stress than happiness. 
215,"I'm 5'9"", and I love getting the 'are you 6'?' question.  I reply with 'Do you at least have C cups?'  Hilarity ensues. 

Everyone in my area uses the 'no hookups' line while they have 3 kids.  WTF do you think it's for?  

**Edit for clarification since the shit winds seem to be a-blowin':**

**I don't think anyone is suggesting height can't be a deciding factor. Everyone is, rightly so, attracted to various things.** It's the hardline approach of 'must be this tall to ride' that I find comical and often indicative of a less than desirable experience forthcoming. My comments have been aimed at the entitlement attitude of must be 6 ft, have a 9 in thick dick, &amp; drive a Porsche when she brings little to the table physically and intellectually. That's when I switch to trolling instead of dating.

To the taller ladies that just want a guy to be taller than them, get after it.  There's no judgement at all. I'm^still^interested^though

To the ladies that just prefer taller guys but aren't bringing rulers to dates, get after it.  There's no judgement at all."
216,"No there isnt, and dont call me shirley."

219,"I'm kind of always in flirt mode, even when asking platonic questions. Make eye contact, smile, physical contact when appropriate. Humor is a great bridge to making plans. Make her laugh, then ask her out."
220,"Not married, but committed 20-year relationship (which is longer than most marriages last these days).

I never feel like I've missed out on anything. 

One, we fulfill each other sexually, I don't see what someone else could offer me ""more"" than she does, and I'm not interested in the thrill of novelty; 

two, the attraction between us has always been so intense that from the moment I met her on I've not for one second been interested in any other woman than her; 

and three, once I commit to someone, I am committed 1000%. 

But even *if* I ever felt that way, I'd not tell her. It would hurt her, badly, and I'd prefer to keep things down that can only result in pain for her."
221,"I was in a very similar situation when I was around 22.  A friend of mine introduced me to her friend, she told me her friend was recently divorced and looking to just hook up for some no strings attached fun.  We all hang out together, my friend goes to bed, and her friend and I hook up.

Cut to a few days later, my balls hurt terribly, it hurts to piss (yeah yeah relevant username) and there's a horrible smelly discharge coming from my dick.  Time to go to the doctor!  Here's some pills for your gonnorhea, do not pass go, do not collect $200, silently weep from the shame.

A few days after that a guy shows up at my apartment, he's not happy, he's also the husband of the chick I hooked up with.  Instead of being confrontational to him I was very honest, the last thing I needed was a broken nose while I was still pissing razor blades.  I invited him in, we talked face to face like men, then he started crying telling me how his wife cheats on him all the time.  Guess who also has the clap?  Her husband does.  At least we could bond over having something in common other than his wife.

After a month I figured I was done with the whole situation, including my now ex-friend, nope I don't get lucky like that.  Guess who's pregnant?  She is.  Guess who's sterile?  Her husband.  Guess who believed her when she said her tubes were tied?  Me, because horny younger me was an idiot.  

For the entire time she was pregnant, every day I woke up and the thought of being a dad weighed on my mind and stressed me out, I wasn't ready to accept that much responsibility, I could barely support me let alone a kid.  When she had the baby my aunt paid for a DNA test because she was a total bro when she was alive.  The baby wasn't mine, I threw a party that night, got plastered, and went to bed happy."
222,I think you may have peed yourself
223,But I have to weed them out. I need someone who hates happiness.
224,My wife was actually the one to suggest we do anal
225,"""Maybe if you were a better teacher we wouldn't have gotten it wrong"""
226,"I said ""if you change your mind, call me,"" and gave her my number. Which she promptly lost.

She was the only girl who said no to the photography line. "
227,"I bought a sixpack of Sierra Nevada and drank one. I had work the next morning.

That weekend, my roommate and two of my sergeants brought me to the casino and got wasted. I ended up being the sober one. My roommate barfed in my car. I won $210 at blackjack."

I follow the sound to find her in the kitchen, dancing around adorably in nothing but her superman panties making us both breakfast. Cute as heck, and that booty??  BAM. I was in love with this girl."
235,"I started working on my confidence, posture and replacing all the negative thoughts and victim mentality with a more positive outlook on life. As this gained traction I became a lot more comfortable being me, instead of trying to be someone I thought other people would like. The biggest shift came when I stopped obsessing about women, which I imagined made me more relaxed around them instead of being a giant, thirsty bundle of nerves. I'll admit that I have no idea exactly what happened, but on my end I came to a point where I thought ""Fuck it, I'm done with women"" and started focusing on myself, my well being and having more fun in life. Lo and behold, a few months later I started getting a *lot* more attention from women around me."
236,"Background: I'm brown, turbaned, a chronic/untreatable funnyman, and often mistaken for Muslim.  
Because of this,  I often say things like ""allahu akbar!"" when I'm about to nut or ""suicide vest fits pretty well"" when I'm putting on a condom. I also once referred to the trait of being female as ""Carnal Tunnel Syndrome,"" to great effect.  
Usually, both of us think it's hilarious and go with it. Sex should be fun and natural, not tense and forced!"
237,"Are you kidding me? 

Grab those tits that are hanging in your face. Suck on them. Grab or slap her ass. Wrap your arms around her and bear hug her. Thrust into her. Girl on top is fucking great. "
238,"I'm a woman who has had multiple male housemates. It went fine, exactly the same as having female housemates. Some were courteous, others were slobs who never did the dishes. 

We all mostly kept to ourselves. One of the guys was more outgoing and would invite the house to watch movies with him. Another just stayed in his room whenever he was home but would politely say hi or make small talk if we were both in the kitchen. 

Nothing sexy, nothing awkward, no tension. Well, no sexual tension. Plenty of ""Do the dishes or I'll fucking murder you"" tension."
239,"My overall fitness, I know I'm doing well but I really need to get into a better shape."
240,"Cheated on me while I was deployed in the military, then tried to tell me it was my fault for being away. I was in the military already when we started dating, and I had rented a place I could barely afford so that she could stay somewhere away from the trouble she was in when we met.

Young and dumb..."
241,"This reminds me of the famous [4chan post with a list of Smash Brothers sex puns](http://i.imgur.com/Jck6NWL.png). As a man who has had sex a non-zero number of times, I recommend never using any of these on an actual woman."

261,"1 : It's very long to achieve and can be super frustrating

3 : It last longer than a classical orgasm, i'd say it last 30 seconds longer."
262,"There's a bunch of times that made me realize she's the one.

1) Maybe our second or third time hanging out, we both sat down crisscross applesauce on the floor, and she farted, and she was so embarrassed but I thought it was funny. 

2) She tells me all the time she loves sleeping on my chest, hearing me breath, and my heart breathing. I decided to sleep on her chest one night, and she filled my Snapchat with cute pictures of us sleeping.

3) Might be creepy to some people, but I think it's sweet. She says when she's laying next to me when I'm sleeping, she just looks at me and think about how happy she is with me. "

If I'm feeling something negative about him, even if I know it's not rational and will pass, I should discuss it with him in detail and not worry about it hurting his feelings or upsetting him at all.  

And, since I'm not willing to do the above, I've been advice that I should break up with him to spare him the pain of dating me."
302,"Kind of makes me sad to read this thread where femininity refers to ""weakness"". I perfectly get what everyone here means and I don't blame anyone - in fact I shouldn't even have to say this.

317,"There aren't ""lines"" i use, because every girl and conversation is different. Flirting doesn't have to happen in one sitting, it can progress with time. But the general ""stages"" that I would follow are:

- Can you talk easily, not forced or one sided

- Can you make her laugh and joke 

- Can you say some cheeky things and make her smile/laugh/blush or be cheeky back

- Can you imply some innuendo and have it make her smile/laugh/blush and reciprocate

If you get to the last stage, you should have her number already or damn well get it. If you don't get positive responses to any, take a step back or consider it a failure and move on"

320,"Women are going to be into you or not and vice versa.  I've seen guys talking to girls at parties keeping it small talk for awhile and walking away without a number so sad like you.  Two problems with this, 1) they can sense it on you, they can smell it on you.  I know this because I smell it from across the room, I'm a dude so I got a dude nose for it and women have a blood hound nose for it. 2)  Even if they might be into you, they get the smell but you aren't taking the conversation outside of ""how about that weather at your pet dog's job"" they get bored, you're boring and afraid to sort of take the lead.

Try to get a sense on how a girl acts when she's into vs. just friendly small talk, it's a big fucking difference.  if this means you gotta talk to some old fat chicks then go talk to some old fat chicks.  If your intentions are asking her on a date steer the conversation that way ""Hey what's a good sushi place? oh yeah, we should go.""

You don't need to flirt, you need to be honest and drop the fear of rejection.  You will get a lot of rejection. Girls are typically non-confrontational, she won't laugh at you for the sushi invite, she will just be busy thst day with no open ends."

4. If she says no don't take it as the end of the world. Keep being nice and respectful towards her and don't shut her out. Take from experience she may just put you over with her friends. "

I remember one night getting plastered and calling up my FWB, only to get super mad when he arrived and I found out he had been drinking as well. I'm not saying this is what happened to her, but I understand those urges and the shame that makes it hard to admit.
That being said, it's definitely not okay to do anything like that without clearing it ahead of time. Lots of communication and safe words are key for any type of rape roleplay."
345,"He was a good friend of a guy I consider one of my best friends. They'd been friends since elementary school. I always thought he was a douchebag, and didn't give a rats ass about anyone but himself.

This is all fine, except that he shits on everyone around him that has different priorities than him. If someone spends time at the gym and socializing with friends and as a result doesn't have the same quality career he thinks they're worthless garbage. Not only does he think that, he tells everyone.

Pretty sure he's just insecure about his lack of a social life and physical health and many other things, but it's pretty obnoxious for him to think he's gods gift to the world when he struggles in so many areas."

1. Max out employer matched 401k contributions. Those are 100%+ returns on investment since the 401k goes on to make more money the more you contribute.

2. Pay off loans highest interest rate first. Making extra payments towards the principle saves an obscene amount of money so do it.

3. You can also pay off the smallest loan first if you want, but if you do then once its fully paid off take the monthly payment that you would have paid and put that towards the next loan and make that shit snowball.

4. Pay off your credit card in full every month and always pay with credit if you can afford to in order to further build your credit.

This is why I don't like the first and only thing. You don't know what type of woman you really want until you experience a few different ones."
353,I know someone you can easily make dry heave if you remind him that women do grow body hair
354,My biggest missed opportunity so far was not screwing my Zumba instructor. Im still kicking myself for it.
355,"FTFY: I ain't those guys

"
356,"Damn I'm sorry man. Screw her that just messed up. A lot of times people don't realize how much the other person would appreciate it if they were just honest and said they weren't interested anymore.

The only thing for you to do is just let it go and head back home. It's not gonna undo anything that happened today, but it is the way to move forward."
357,I'm the girlfriend. I can kill bugs without screaming and freaking the fuck out.
358,"Jokes on them, I've been fixed."
359,:(
360,"Lack of confidence.

Laziness.

Not knowing about weightlifting."
361,I thought jaywalking was a stupid thing to get in trouble for then I got hit by a car so I don't do that anymore.
362,"""Girls will break rules for guys they like, and make rules for guys they don't""

Chances are, if she had sex quickly with other guys in the past but won't with you, she's just not attracted to you. Or at the very least, she sees you as a provider or ""stable"" guy who doesn't really turn her on. 

A girl who actually finds you hot won't make you jump through hoops to have sex with her. I personally would cut contact pretty quick. I want to date someone who lusts after me and is excited about hopping in bed with me. Not someone who has the mentality of ""I want you to take me out on dates for at least X months until I'll let you get any"". Especially if she had no problem fucking random strangers in the past."
363,Felt bad for the first girl. Was happy to be with the second girl. 
364,"Not a fan of the dark lipsticks, or lipstick in general. A good layer of Chapstick to make the lips soft and fresh looking is best. "
365,"For whatever reason, thigh gaps just aren't my thing. "
366,I've only hated it with women who don't respond to it.
367,When I realized I was blaming other people for my problems and I wasn't actually being nice or myself. 
368,"I like watching people taller than me run into them.


Also I'm literally Hitler so it's what I do :P"
369,And that's why she's your ex...
370,"These are all good, but I find nothing beats the standard ""you like that, you fucking retard?"""
371,Why didn't you just go to her apartment lol
372,"&gt;So you get your canned chopped chicken,


no you don't"
373,"Hey you're not OP!

EVERYONE LOOK OVER HERE! A BIG FAT PHONEY"
374,"Selling my ~3000 bitcoins when they were ~8 cents a piece (had just risen 1000% in like 4 days or something).

I don't want to look but I think they are over 1000 bucks each now. "
375,that boy ain't right.
376,"A month? Holy shit, I thought you were talking about a few days or something. 

That sounds tiring as fuck. "
377,"Not only could you probably share that story with your friends, sounds like a lot of them were involved in the story with you. "
378,"I almost always sit down to pee. I live alone, so who's gonna know? Plus it gives me a chance to check my phone without worrying about dropping it in the toilet. "
379,The grass is greener where you water it.
380,"Squats. Holy shit, her squats. I could watch that all day."
381,"Maybe not specifically manly, but I'm an engineer, she's not. However, most of the time when something needs to be fixed she is the one who will come up with some crazy-yet-robust solution. Being an engineer I feel like this should be my force, but she really has a knack for it! "
382,I need more science before I stop worrying
383,"Picked up a girl at a bar who wanted to go back to her apartment.  As we got close, I realized she lived in the same complex as a married couple I was good friends with and who I had helped move out just a few days before.  Knowing their old apartment was probably still vacant, I hopped the fence near the back patio, slid open the sliding door (unlocked) and went to the front door to let her in.

We banged on the bedroom floor because there was no furniture and the carpeting was cleaner than in the living room.  I'm not sure they would care, but it's a little awkward to tell a married couple you used their recently-abandoned bedroom for a one-night stand."
384,"It would be extremely painful...

*...for them.*"
385,"This happened about 5 minutes ago:

I've had some tendinitis in my foot for the past couple weeks. My wife has been nagging me to go to the doctor about it. I tell her, I've been to doctors. They say it's tendinitis. She tells me she doesn't think it is.

So I went to the doctor yesterday. He didn't say tendinitis, but his diagnosis was way off the mark, and we both knew that. I was texting her about it today and she hits me with:

""I think it's tendinitis."""
386,"Terribly low self esteem, depression, lots of anxiety, displeasure with being in the hospital in the first place, I directed that anger at him and associated him with everything unpleasant in life at that time.

It's probably one of the one or two worst decisions in my life. "
387,"I was listening to NPR with my SO in the car and a female victim of domestic violence was describing how she and her husband were talking about where they would go for dinner and how, after she'd complained she was hungry and declined his first three suggestions, the man snapped and beat her.

I looked meaningfully at my girlfriend and after a long pause she said, ""Yes, I can see how that could happen.""

"
388,"I take care of my skin.

I live in Australia where melanoma rates are sky high. It's rare for me to even leave the house without sunscreen and moisturizer on. I get mocked occasionally for my smooth and pale skin but jokes on them, I can't hear them over the sound of their leathery skin creaking.

EDIT: I have also cried at the end of every single studio ghibli movie"
389,"College. I was a 2nd or 3rd year. I'd hung out with this really cute Freshman girl a few times (I forget where we met). We only made out briefly until this point. I invited her to one of my fraternity date parties. We both get pretty drunk. End up making out in the middle of the dance floor. We go up to my room and chat a bit...she says she's feeling a bit sick, but she's coherent from what I remember. We start making out. I ask her if she's feeling ok. She gets on the bed, takes off her own dress, gets on all 4s, wiggles her ass at me and tells me to come fuck her.  I oblige, and we had sex (very regrettably no condom).  

We fall asleep, and wake up at like 4 or 5am fairly sober. She gives me a blowjob. We fall back asleep.

Next morning we cuddle for a bit. She gets her clothes, kisses me goodbye, and walks home. AFAIK everthing was all good.

Fast forward 2 weeks, and my friend comes up and tells me ""Dude, my friend Matt on the soccer team is telling everyone you raped his girlfriend. He wants to kill you man"". I have no idea whats going on. That girl was the only girl I had sex with recently and she never mentioned a boyfriend. I certainly never raped her. After some questioning, what apparently happened is that girl had became official girlfriend to a guy either a day or two before we hooked up, or immediately after. The guy somehow found out we hooked up - I'm not entirely sure if she volunteered the information, or he found out on his own. So she told him I raped her...presumably to cover her ass.

So I texted the girl that we need to talk. She comes over...alone (interesting move for someone who thinks they were raped). I ask her what all of these rumors are about. She tells me all of a sudden she doesn't remember what happened that night. Or the next morning. I told her exactly what I remember. The conversation didn't really go anywhere after that. She left.

I was scared shitless for the next few months. Her bf was going around telling everyone I raped this girl. The entire soccer team wants to kill me. I think I'm going to be beaten up or arrested at any second. At one point he used a fake FB account to try to lure me to an off campus apartment.

Oh to top things off, she gave me genital herpes. I had a severe initial outbreak that started a couple days after we had sex. It was an abnormal case which lasted months, with over a hundred sores. It was the worst pain I've ever been in.  

Ever since then I lost trust in every girl I sleep with. In the early stages I'd even try to subtly turn on my cellphone voice recorder to get audio of verbal consent...but don't do that anymore. I still am hyperaware of intoxication levels when sleeping with a new girl. Very very hesitant to engage in one night stands. Maybe a positive side effect is I'm a lot more responsible with who I sleep with.

So yea, that sucked. "
390,"Reported boss to OSHA for safety violations and then the IRS for skimming our paychecks. 

OSHA notified me the day before they were going to do a spot check. Boss ended up losing his contract and got hit with a $75,000 fine.

A few months later my old boss was in the newspaper after he got convicted of tax fraud and was sentenced to 10 years."
391,"Slept with a girl who had a boyfriend. She hung out with our group, without him, and complained about him all the time. I still shouldn't have done it, but I was on a drought of like 3-4 years. 

A few months later she told her bf, who started threatening me online, both in messages and linking me to videos of people being murdered.  I had moved away by then but was concerned since my family was around. The police just said there wasn't anything they could do and I'd need to contact the police where I was. 

Meh anyway the guy shut up eventually. "
392,"I have two right now and it's fine. I rarely see them anyway. If you think that living with them will open your life up to moments of debauchery, well, that's probably not going to happen."
393,"Being cocky. A lot of women say they like ""confident but not cocky"" but I've found most women don't really know the difference, and like cocky."
394,"Let the record show that Honey-Badger, indeed, did not care."
395,....did you not read?  She already turned him down.  She likes the attention he gives her.  
396,"I just want to say fuck tickling.  I'm extremely ticklish, and when somebody starts in with me, I laugh so hard that I can't breathe.  It's like if you had spasms in your diaphragm that forced you to exhale and wouldn't let you take in more air.  Eventually I start to feel like I'm suffocating; I'm struggling to force myself to gasp some oxygen, fighting against the urge to continue laughing (which at this point isn't actually making any noise because I have no air left in my lungs), and I'm going into serious panic mode.  I start lashing out physically, trying to get the person away from me long enough to start breathing again, then I usually start crying.

The worst part is that tickling is an innocent, playful thing, so people don't realize that they're doing something wrong.  ""But you were laughing!""  I didn't have any control over that, asshole."
397,"Like i said, if she would have asked me i would have been down. I've done rape roleplay with a couple of girls before, but her just hoping that i raped her without asking was a giant red flag."
398,Works better if used during gay sex 
399,I'm like your friend. Big butts do nothing for me.
400,"The fact that she may be trying to lure you into friendship by dressing sexy and presenting her ass to you makes me wonder what she actually means by ""friendship."" I don't think she understands how platonic relationships work.

Part of me wonders if she doesn't actually want friendship but wants you to stick around as some kind of lifeboat if her relationship were ever to sink."
401,"Yep exactly this. Believe me, no girl will care if you don't have a car if your in a city university or any college for that matter. Take Seattle, Washington for example. Most people don't have a car there, not because they can afford it but because it is incredibly inefficient to use. That goes for college students and others. 

The girl isn't worth it if she doesn't stay around cause you don't have a car. "
402,"I'm Californian too. I've never heard ""oreo,"" but people in school would call me a banana - yellow (Asian) on the outside, white on the inside. 

It *is* pretty insulting cause it implies white people have a monopoly on American culture. I was *born here,* so this is just as much my culture as it is yours. I'm not acting ""white,"" I'm just acting like any other American kid in this upper middle class California suburb."
403,"""No bathroom selfies"" or ""no shirtless pics boys""

How about I put up whatever fucking pictures I want, and if you don't like them: slide left"
404,"Ya me too.  I act this way with people in general, even men.  Just make jokes, smile, have light hearted conversation, and both men and women will like you.  I don't do the physical contact piece ""kino"" with men though, only women.  Unless I'm feeling a bit gay.  Just kidding.  Or am I?  *Wink* "
405,"23 is a little late to the party, but not so late that it's impossible to work with. Just don't let it dissuade you from even trying. I believe in you. "
406,"The day-to-day changes are subtle, but my wife isn't the same person she was yesterday or last week, let alone when we first met. That means I'm banging a different woman every night. :)"
407,"Asking a girl for her number or to go on a date with you is not ""pulling out the big guns."" Asking for anal, or a threesome with another woman are ""big guns."" 

A lot of flirting begins with teasing. Busting a girl's chops in a playful way. If you're not good at that, then try to form a connection. Try to find common ground. It can be anything. Take it and run with it. I'm not there with you, I can't decode the woman's body language and other nuances that would tell me where to steer the conversation. You have to do the heavy lifting. But the overall point is - don't make asking for her number or asking her out a monumental thing. It should be natural and fluid. 

If you're meeting these girls at bars and parties, after your convo, just casually say ""here"" and hand her your phone with an add new contact page on the screen. This is how I've done it, I've never actually asked a girl for her number straight up. It usually looks like this:

Me: Joking/teasing.

Her: Joking/teasing. 

Me: Haha yeah, totally. Totally. Oh. Here. 

*Hands her phone*

*She types contact in phone*

Me (as she's typing): Joking/teasing. 

And we continue our conversation. *Sometimes* I'll ask for her gram instead, and then build a little rapport through there before DMing her for her number. I only do this if time is limited and I didn't have enough time to build rapport. "
