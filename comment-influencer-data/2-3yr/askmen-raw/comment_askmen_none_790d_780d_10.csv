25,No. Instead I'll blackmail the entire world into giving me money instead. If each woman in the world gave me 1 cent to prevent being shrunk down I'd have 35 million instead. I'd double that amount by telling men to also pay me 1 cent each which they would of course pay because they wouldn't want to lose out on women.

49,"I fully believe that a man truly in love becomes the best version of himself that he can and will ever be. 

There‚Äôs something about knowing that a person you‚Äôre madly in love with feels the same way about you that makes you want to do things you‚Äôve never done before. As a man, even when you know she‚Äôs already yours and you‚Äôre already hers, you‚Äôll still want to impress her, in every single moment. 

I loved a girl once and because of that love, I was motivated to do the things I‚Äôd always wanted to do but never did. I worked out and got fucking shredded when previously I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to stick with it for longer than a few days. My laziness melted away and my procrastination was handled immediately, all because I knew that doing these things I wanted to do, that she knew I wanted to do, would make her happy and fall in love with me even more. I was never bored, never not motivated to go out and experience the world and do things when normally I‚Äôd be in bed all day doing nothing. Why? Because that‚Äôs what she wanted to do. And I knew it‚Äôd make her happy. And it made me happy knowing that I made her. 

It goes both ways, I think, but in men, that primal instinct we all have to prove ourself and earn and do things worth showing off gets cranked way. "

Honestly, no matter how clumsy I feel like you'd have to be attached at my hip to get elbowed in the face 3 times in one day.  Same with stepping on feet.

So...you either don't see your gf that week, only see her briefly, or see her AND the kid.


If you're averse to any contact with the kid, it probably won't work out. I and her kid get along, so when I do see them, it's fine..but if the kid was annoying, it would make it hard.

107,"I personally love the way a guy described it from a thread in askwomen some time ago.

&gt;I'm not ""mansplaining"" or trying to discount how you feel - I'm offering a perspective that might help. Believe me - I know what it's like to dislike your body. I got zapped in Iraq and I've got some unsightly scars, and I sometimes struggle to accept that I'll never be as physically capable as I used to be. Fucking sucks sometimes.  

&gt;Anyway...I wish I could let you into a man's head as he's falling in love with a woman. It's a process that's so alien, so strange, that I'm afraid you've got to experience it to believe it. But it's as real as death and taxes....  
Sometimes, a guy will meet a gal and think nothing of it. Maybe she's a co-worker, classmate, or his buddy's friend. She gets mentally categorized as ""Female, acquaintance, feelings neutral"". Then, he gets to know her better. If they mesh personality-wise, something fascinating happens in the man's mind. He starts to notice things about her appearance - pleasant things. It starts small - one day he realizes he likes looking at the curve of her nose, or where her ear lobe meets her face.  
It's nothing he can put his finger on or describe, really...just that looking at that part of her makes him feel good. He starts wanting to do that more. Then, he notices an expression she makes - could be her genuine belly-laugh, or the way she furrows her brow in concern - and he gets a little flutter in his chest.  

&gt;They stay friendly for awhile, get to know each other better.  

&gt;Then, one day, she hugs him goodbye....and he can't stop thinking about it. He plays it over and over in his head - the feel of her breasts through two shirts, her arms around his back, her smell...he finds these little mental movies of her playing unbidden when he's driving somewhere, squeezing out his other usual daydreams.  

&gt;Shortly thereafter, the guy realizes that whenever he looks at this woman, he feels good. He likes her lines, her curves, her sounds and smells...  

&gt;It's like she's gradually turned from a black-and-white photo into a 3D color movie with surround-sound - a perfect movie that makes him feel good. He starts wondering what he can do to keep her around, to make her happy. He realizes that he likes looking at her more than any other human being in the world.  

&gt;To him, she is perfect and beautiful.  

&gt;A man in love with a woman doesn't see her objectively. There is a filter there, or some kind of participatory illusion. He does not see who you see in the mirror. He is seeing someone beautiful and perfect and sublime, and it's one of the most powerful things in his life.  

&gt;Go watch a happy old couple that's been married for decades. Watch the man's eyes. Sure, he may appreciate some young woman's ass in yoga pants or whatever...but watch his eyes when he's looking at his spouse. If you're paying close enough attention, you can almost see the filter click on when his gaze settles on her. In that moment, he's not seeing the same frumpy empty-nester that you or I see - he's seeing something wonderful.  

&gt;No shit. If I hadn't lived this stuff, I wouldn't believe it either. But it's true.

138,"Falling asleep mid sex could sort of, possibly, be taken as a good sign, depending on the overall atmosphere and relationship. I've fallen asleep while masturbating several times because I was just so relaxed and it felt so good and soothing and I just drifted off. I had a guy fall asleep while I was slowly stroking him, he even started snoring gently, it was adorable. When he woke up about 15 minutes later he just smiled at me and said that was the most comfortable he had ever been in someone else's bed, made me feel good. Of course, if you were really going at it and she just straight up fell asleep from boredom/lack of stimulation or something, that's... unfortunate, haha."

One day I tried to text and call her, couldn't reach her. So I called her mother asking her to get her daughter to call me; and she replied ""why is something wrong? Is she not with you?"" I was confused, I went with it.

""No, she had a a hissy fit and stormed off just wondering where she is"" (I was close with her mother, and she knows how bitchy she can be)

""That girl, storming off while in a camping site, who knows what weirdos are roaming those woods"" 

So of course when I was actually able to contact her I found out she went with someone else. I told her dad all of this and even got my parents to agree that we have never gone camping. "

148,"40 years ago, my wife and I at our camp with another couple for a week.  Log cabin.  No power, no shower, no running water.  Baths taken in the river, which was down a stair case from the camp.  The female half of our friends was going to wash her hair, warned me so I wouldn't go look, got down there, removed her top.......and realized she had forgotten the bucket used to pour water over her head.  Covered herself by holding her shirt up over her boobs, yelled to me to throw her the bucket.

I came out with the bucket, and as I went to throw it, the Devil whispered in my ear ""throw high""

I did.  She reached with both hands to catch, dropping the shirt.

She estimated me to be about 23, and when I told her the truth she excused herself and said she would never date a younger guy. I find that a very odd idea, especially given that she clearly seemed interested before when she thought I was older..."
151,"No idea. Eventually, I just gave up and concluded that when people said I wasn't unattractive, they lacked enough motive to be lying.

152,"I can't watch porn. Every time I go one one of those sites, a horny milf in my neighborhood wants to chat with me. Sometimes we exchange a few pleasantries, but usually they just want to fuck me right now. 

I'm usually at their place in a half hour or so, and we end up having sex, and by the time I get home, I'm not horny enough to jerk off and pull up the ol porn anymore. 

And, if I do end up getting back online, there's just another horny milf in the neighborhood looking to fuck again. 

Quite honestly, I don't know why any of you guys bother jerking off to porn. So many horny milfs looking to fuck in your neighborhood. "

162,"Ok I read most of the responses here and I respectfully disagree with the majority of it. Now I am going to go over some of your facts to make sure I am personally not jumping the gun.

&gt;  she has made a bunch of lady friends through work. They're all single, she's the only taken one in the group.

 ALL OF THEM!? Not one of them has a boyfriend?! Not a red flag but an orange one in my book. Ladies tend to adapt to and mimic their environment. A taken woman will behave like a single one in that kind of setting.

&gt; They occasionally go out for ""girls nights"" together, of which I'm obviously rarely invited to.

 Depending on how frequent occasional is this may or may not be an issue. Is she going out every weekend? Every other day? What?

&gt; My girlfriend is the kind of girl who very frequently checks her phone. When I'm with her she's pretty much glued to the thing and very responsive to anyone who messages her.

That is a red flag unless you are calling her every hour on the hour. A person that is glued to their phone doesn't break that habit regardless of who they are with. I can guarantee shes semi glued to her phone when she's out as well. If she's not answering your calls or messages then shes ignoring them. 

&gt;  I won't lie, it makes me feel really insecure / paranoid

No her behavior is setting off alarms in your head because you know if the positions where reversed you wouldn't do the same thing. Insecurity is asking her if she loves you every few hours. This is your brain telling you something could be up. There is a major difference.

&gt;  I know it's illogical because we've been together for so long  

Length of the relationship doesn't mean a thing. If she finds something better then guess what? Not saying that is what is going on but don't use the length as an excuse as to why she wouldn't do something. If that is the case you'd think after six years of being together she wouldn't ignore you for hours at a time right?

&gt; I pretty much don't hear a peep from her for 2,3,4+ hours. 
 
 Now for me personally that is unacceptable and suspicious. Again if the positions were reverse how would she behave and gauge the situation from your answer.

&gt; she usually only ends up responding when she's on her way home. 

 That is common for people that have been ignoring you the entire day/night. Another flag here.


&gt; I feel like im being insecure, since I trust her,

 No you don't and to be honest considering her actions I wouldn't either. Again don't confuse suspicion for insecurity, they are two different beasts. If you 100% trusted her this post wouldn't even exists. In fact the thought wouldn't cross your mind,

&gt; What are signs to look for of this being the case?

 Here are a few for sure:

* She pays more attention to her phone than you.

* She's less interested in sex.

* Her social calendar is suddenly bursting at the seams.

* She makes a point to say she‚Äôs unhappy.

* She falls off the radar for large gaps of time.

 Now out of 5 I can see shes got at least two of these under her belt already. The other three only you can answer for sure. As for giving her space she seems to be creating plenty for herself already. Keep an eye on this, as it's not something you should just chill out about. On another note I would still find things to occupy your time anyway. Your girlfriend shouldn't be your only source of social interaction."
163,"Being a straight man is exactly the same as what you're describing.  Most straight men spend their lives attracted to women that are way out of their league.  They have plenty of rage about the fact that these women aren't attracted to them, you can see it painted all over Reddit."

165,"On paper I had a very stable life pretty young (career, education, bought house at 24, no car payments etc) so in the back of my mind I was always wondering if they really loved me or if they simply liked me and realized I was a good choice for their kid.  And honestly I can't blame them, because my #1 priority would be giving my child the best life they can and stability helps with that considerably.  "

So, yeah, don't do that.

Then again, I was 10 years old. You're an adult. It'll probably be hard for you but it's not the end of the world. Try to talk to your dad from time to time. He'll probably be grieving for a while, that's normal, just make sure he doesn't dull his feelings with excessive booze or drugs. Be supportive if or when he tries to meet a new partner. Take your own time to deal with this as well, but don't shirk on the other stuff you mentioned. Seeing his oldest son do well will probably mean the world to your dad."

187,"Worst was more a lack of dialogue after my first time, which was the end of a summer fling with brilliant, lovely girl who taught me everything from kissing to sex. I wanted to learn how to get her off and you could just tell...  lessons were over.

Best would be either ""I don't believe you've only had sex once or twice"" or ""That's never happened before"" after a few full bodied orgasms and a girl tapping out.  Thanks for the study notes, summer girl."
188,Really? That looks pretty boring.
189,"I mean, as you should be.  How its this a pitfall?  Its a kid.  She's his/her mom.  You're a grown man.  The kids' needs are far more important than yours and its a mother's biological duty to care for her child above anybody else.

Edit: I realize my comment is a bit off topic from the question that OP is really asking.  I agree it can indeed be a pitfall in the context of a relationship.  Just stating that coming 2nd to a kid goes for all parents, including a spouse, not just single mothers, as parents are biologically influenced to care for their children above anybody else."

198,"She told me she was pregnant and that it was up to me if I wanted to be with her, but if I didn't want a child she'd leave me and I'd never see her again. I didn't want a child, I was at uni and broke, but I wanted her and so I stayed with her.

She then told me a couple months later she thought she had a miscarriage, she went to get checked out and all that and told me they confirmed it. Turns out the doctor visit was because she was developing schizophrenia. 

I found out about the schizophrenia during the relationship, it's a bit hard to hide from someone you live with. But she still kept going on about the baby, I said something in passing to one of her by then former best friends a few years later and she told me she'd made it all up. Obviously I confronted my now ex about it and she told me the truth, that she thought she was pregnant, and because we were going through a rocky patch she decided to tell me she was and had already planned it all out to keep me around.

Assure her mom that you're not settling for her daughter, you've been through loads of women in college and this one is just so special you can't let go. No worries about pump and dump here. Suggest that she might even be marriage material. 

Offer her little brother to hit the gym with you to show you're a team player and part of the family. Teach him some tricks in Call Of Duty. 

If she has sisters, make a joke apology about how you're already taken. Other than that just talk about fashion and comment on their outfits. 

Close with a gentle touch. Give each family member a rose with a special message just for them. Look through some hallmark cards for suggestions, they're usually pretty spot on. 

Alright, now you're ready to knock it out of the park.

Main thing is just have tact. Be respectful even if you think something is really odd. Don't knock on anyone or comment how ugly someone looks in a family photo. Basically just don't be an ass and you should be fine. Also don't rip on them afterward to the GF, she may take offense to that. "

256,"I think there are a couple questions you should ask yourself:

1) Was this a gradual change or a sudden one?

2) Has her behavior changed around you (in person) since this started?

The only reasonable cause for worry is if this change happened suddenly and is accompanied by changes in other behaviors, specifically if she has seems to be less interested in you in person. 

If this is not the case, then it's just normal. People get used to each other, especially if you've been together for 6 years. And at that point I would imagine it's healthy to take time apart from each other once in a while. I am not surprised and neither should you that you're not invited to girl outings.

Just whatever you do, don't keep texting her or bothering her about it. If you know that she isn't going to respond to you until she's on her way home, then why even bother unless it's an emergency? You'll only risk coming off as needy and insecure which is going to drive her away for real, if that's not already the underlying issue. I'm not saying that this is the case with you, but I think that a lot of guys tend to get complacent in relationship and stop doing things that she once found attractive and/or start doing unattractive things.

If you are really *that* concerned, then I would have a conversation with her about it, being extremely careful not to accuse her of cheating. Frame it this way: just tell her that you miss having all those fun conversations with her you used to have by text and you've noticed it hasn't been happening as much anymore, and see what she says."

My boyfriend at the time treated meeting my parents like meeting constituents at a political rally, all firm handshakes and Uncanny Valley grin.  My best advice to guys is to not try SO hard to be ""likeable"".  If you're a good dude, that will shine through in your normal interactions.

287,"Actually, Opening Up The Marriage = she already knows who"
288,"It's not because you're spending too much time together, although you could certainly benefit from some time apart. Here is my best advice for you though:

1) Get a life apart from your life with her. If you have a lot of free time, that's great. That should make this a piece of cake then. Find some hobbies - constructive hobbies that will develop you as a person - NOT video gaming. Explore lots of different activities and hold onto those that you're passionate about. Do NOT do something purely for the sake of having a hobby. The keyword is passion here, and that's not possible to fake.

2) Meanwhile, make some friends. #1 should help you with this. Join interest groups and connect with people who share your new hobbies. If you don't have an occupation that allows you to make friends easily, try meetup.com. Develop a circle of friends that you can hang out with apart from (or with, but mainly apart from) your girlfriend, and make sure you do so regularly.

2a) Do NOT turn this into some weird competition about who can spend the most time *not with* the other person. It's not about ""getting back"" at her or ""showing her how it feels."" If this sentiment ever crosses your mind you should stop and feel ashamed of yourself for a moment. This is about developing you as a person which will make you happier and more secure with yourself and in turn improve your relationship with her.

3) Reassess what it means to be a) a man, b) a boyfriend, and c) a suitor. My guess is that you probably have b) taken care of, but are lacking in a) and c) which ironically are the more important things here. Go on dates with her. Make bold moves. Give her butterflies again. Dress sharply and put on some expensive cologne. Spend *quality* time together, instead of routine boring shit that I'm sure you've got a lot of after all that time. To help you figure out what ""quality"" mean, ask yourself if you'll remember doing this with her a year from now. Laugh and have fun and show her a good time, like you would if you had been dating for 6 weeks and not 6 years.

4) Finally, let go. This is the hardest part and probably the most difficult one to understand but it is important. You have to accept the fact that it might be too late and she's already too far gone and will leave you at some point down the road. I'm not saying that to scare you or make you more anxious about the situation. I'm saying it because you should always learn to accept the fact that people can leave at anytime, regardless of how unlikely it seems. The reason why you feel so insecure about her behavior is because you're holding on way too tightly, because you are terrified of losing her, and ironically, that's causing you to exhibit behaviors which may turn that into a self-fulfilling prophecy. As soon as you can let that go and realize that you will be fine without her (and you will be) and there are other girls for you out there (and there are), things will become a lot clearer and easier for you.

Sorry this got so long lol but hope it helped"

In the end its just an act, and me constantly getting off from viewing fake intimacy made me depressed after a while. I was addicted for years to porn. It was a ritual to me, like brushing my teeth to have a good wank in the mornin'. I began to associate porn with actual relationships, and I truly believe that my porn habit got in the way of a healthy love life. It's hard getting over it, because it's too damn easy. Sometimes I'll partake, but I usually view the softer porn now, like modeling or x-art style. Even then I know it's just acting, and it's nothing compared to real intimacy. "
366,"If I'm allowed to play armchair psychologist for a second, I believe this is called emotional extortion or something of the like. It's one of the building blocks for a toxic and abusive relationship.

369,"I dated a girl for about a month when I was 19 who wasn't on the pill. During sex she kept telling me to finish in her then broke down crying when I didn't. Needless to say I didn't talk to her afterwards. She didn't really try to contact me much afterwards, I think she understood that I didn't want to put up with that crazy shit. "

372,"That kinda describes my step mom (snob, high end clothes, fancy services and not so much the immature stuff). I'm not too sure why my dad is really into her since he is sort of a minimalist, but maybe it has to do with her still looking good in her 60s and some similar interests.    

Edit: I feel I should also add some positive aspects since I do like her. She works in executive positions and can afford the shit she buys, and she does have interesting stories and is nice to people close to her. Big reason why I wonder how her and dad get along is due to different political beliefs, religious beliefs, views on smoking, and how to treat kids after high school."

374,"When you say ""she didn't do it on purpose""....it's almost worse, because she did it because she had no consideration for your time. She never thought to call you ahead of time and plan it out, to consider that you actually have a life and your own things going on. It's a lack of consideration on her part, she takes it for granted that you will drop anything for her. 

You're a really good brother. "

381,"In a comitted relationship when you get to a point of trust some people will forgo the expense and pleasure blockers of condoms. Sometimes women will break that trust and just stop taking birth control all together. Then people like you will be like ""hurrr hurrr why didnt you just use a condom"" portraying themselves as somone whos never actually been in a long term relationship.
 
Lying about your birth control is aboslutely a shitty thing to do ESPECIALLY when there is literally nothing a man can do.
 
Meanwhile if you take your condom off during intercourse without telling the woman you can be charged convicted and imprisoned for a sexual offence.

394,"**Good:**

I had tried a really spicy hot sauce a month earlier and it burned me pretty good. So I decided I would build my tolerance. I bought a bottle of strong hot sauce and put it on nearly everything I ate; I put progressively more on as my tolerance got stronger.

Fast forward to me with my partner at the time. She wanted to try me finishing in her mouth. I was all for it. We do the deed, I finish in her mouth. Then she says ""Did you eat something spicy? Because your cum tasted like Thai food.""

**Bad:**

I didn't have a lot of success with women when I was younger and I was pretty insecure about it. I also wasn't very good at performing and was insecure about that, too. I had a hard time getting started and then I'd have a hard time lasting very long.

I got into pick-up as a way to overcome those insecurities. One of the books recommended acting as if you were already a ladies' man when you were with women. I had hit it off with a barista; we went out later, went back to her place and had sex. For about a minute.

We go on a second date. I think I laid it on a little heavy with the ""I get around"" game. End of the night we go back to her place, I get it up but I last less than a minute, again. I'm disappointed in myself and all the old insecurities are bubbling up again. Then she says ""Is that all you do? You pick up girls then can't do anything with them?""

That hurt pretty bad for a long time but it doesn't bother me anymore. I've been fortunate enough to overcome my romantic/sexual insecurities through a combination of doing better with women and changing how I see myself.

404,"I'd recommend coffee, to be honest. Less likely that liquid courage is gonna be involved, which is a good thing because it gets rid of a small crutch, clubs would be too loud to actually enjoy each other's company, and bars/pubs can be a mixed bag. but a simple cafe could be a great way to wind down after a long day at the office. "
405,"I think ultimately you don't have a say in it. But seeing that your partner is someone you care a lot about, you should strive for some compromise and discuss changes.     

If one person thinks he/she can veto a change that would be just as big a problem as not caring at all about what your partner thinks about a change you plan. "

442,"I'd known what some of the symptoms were from my education so that helped me realise something was wrong, in the end she told me but I knew something wasn't right and would have guessed at schizophrenia, even though I was in no position to say exactly.

It started of with small things. We'd be spending time together and she'd turn her head and stare at things that weren't there, when she did she either mumbled to herself as if she was talking to someone or become very agitated about what she was seeing. 

She'd try to talk to me about things that didn't happen or that no one could physically do, convinced we did them or that we could. She'd also become aggressive with me for no reason, then a few minutes later snap out of it and ask what was going on. 

I'd overhear her talking to someone in the other room, I kept thinking she was on the phone. I'd ask her about it, she said she was talking to someone called Helen, now she had a family friend called Helen so until I didn't think much of it to begin with. That is until one night I woke up to her curled up in bed crying and repeating ""no"". She said she was talking to this Helen girl who was sat at the end of the bed and Helen hated me. Now no one was there, but bloody hell that was terrifying. 

A week or so later I found her crying in the kitchen holding a knife, Helen had been telling her she had to hurt/kill me for weeks none stop. After I'd gotten the knife, calmed her down and all that she told me about the diagnosis. "

450,"These are all the same ex. I don't know if these count as entrapment, but it was manipulative.

1. Me: Wanna do dinner tonight?
    Her: I can't, I'm having dinner  with Chris
    Me: Oh, cool. Tell him I say hey! And take pictures of the food if it's good!
    Her: Aren't you worried?!
    Me: ......No...?
    Her: *odd grunt/sound that signaled acknowledgement of and dissatisfaction with my response*

2. The time she got upset with me because my dinner plans with a female friend interfered with her ""plans to make plans with me"". She accused me of cheating and then, in order to help ""fight her anxieties"", suggested: *""Please be more forthcoming about your plans with people throughout the week so I'm not taken by surprise. Like literally send me your plans to hang out with people as you make them. Let's try it for a couple of weeks and see how it goes.""* I, of course, said ""no"".

3. I don't live with people. She knew this well before we dated. Toward the end of our (7 month) relationship, she basically tried to convince me to move her in by arguing that we'd have more sex that way.

4. The time she asked out of the blue, quite calmly, if I watch porn, then freaked out and screamed and cried at me when I said I did. When I failed to respond to her by trying to comfort her,calm her down, or offer to stop viewing it, she mellowed and then went ""Would you give it up if I asked you to?. I, of course, said ""no"". Cue more crying and wailing. 

Eventually, I was just like, ""Look...you don't get a say in how I masturbate. This a dealbreaker for you?""
