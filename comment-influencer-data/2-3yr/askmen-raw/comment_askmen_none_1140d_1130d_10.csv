0,"When I turned 21 I became an EMT and began working 911 response in Detroit. I don't do that anymore, but I keep very close to me two letters that I was sent by a hospital after two particularly difficult runs. The letters are a little weird honestly, half congratulations on a job well done, half a follow up to let me know what happened with the patients.

The first was a mother who'd been stabbed in the arm. It wasn't a terribly large wound, but the placement was just so that the knife shredded her brachial artery, and she lost blood incredibly quickly. My partner and I were two kids in our twenties, suddenly dealing with a woman dying as her kids looked on. Once we got her in the ambulance, away from the children, she seized my eyes with hers and asked me ""am I gonna die?"" and as I promised her she wouldn't, she stopped breathing and had a seizure. The ride to the hospital was a blur, I was driving while trying to radio in a report to the hospital, when suddenly my partner yells that she's breathing again. About two minutes later we pulled up to the hospital and that was that. We'd done it. We'd saved that woman's life. There wasn't a shadow of doubt in my mind. My partner started crying after we got back in the rig as I drove home and kept saying to him ""you did it man, you fucking saved her"". It was the last call of our shift, we cleaned up the ambulance and went home.

The second run was a motorcycle accident. There was a crowd of people before we even arrived and the police strobe lights were bouncing off the pavement, highlighting the damp patches and streaks. Our patient hadn't worn a helmet, or gloves, or boots, his only protection was his leather vest, covered in local gang patches, though several were ripped away as he was flung from his seat and skidded almost 50 yards from where his bike lay. He was unconscious, he had obvious fractures in his skull, and he was breathing maybe two or three times a minute with the kind of ragged, heaving respirations that let you know something's properly wrong. We did what we could, but the problems he had you can't fix with a basic life support rig and elbow grease. My partner drove fast, I kept him breathing, we dropped him off to the hospital knowing it'd be a miracle if he survived. I mean he was already on his way out and we didn't even have the full bill of what was killing him. When we got back in the ambulance we knew we'd done our jobs, and we knew that kid would die, we didn't have to say anything. It was the last run of our shift, we cleaned, we smoked, we went home.

A month or so later I got my letters. I had to read them several times through to even make sense of them as they were so cryptic, but my eyes settled on a certain sentence: ""Jane Doe was found pulseless post-surgery"". The mother died. And on the next one: ""John Doe was stable post surgery and is beginning recovery."" The gang member lived.

There's that saying that the opposite of love isn't hate, it's apathy. In that moment, reading those letters, I felt the full weight of the world's apathy, and I was absolutely crushed beneath it.


Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming response guys, I'm so glad that people were moved by these experiences and I was able to shine a little light on EMS. It's a demanding job that's often forgotten amidst conversations about firefighters and police. I'm definitely gonna try to respond to any questions/comments once I have some free time. (Also 6x gold? damn son)"
1,"September 2007 (or was it 2008 - it's hazy now). My wife was bleeding out internally; she had an ectopic pregnancy that had ruptured while I was at work. When we got her to the ER, her blood pressure as 50/20 (or somewhere thereabouts) - very nearly dead. 

The hospital we took her to first wasn't equipped to help her, so they called around trying to find somewhere to take her (St Francis in Columbus GA). Another hospital in town said ""don't bring her here - she'll only die"" (Medical Center in Columbus GA - yes this really happened). We finally found one that could/would operate on her (GYN unit at Doctor's Hospital in Columbus GA), and had to transport her by ambulance.

I will never forget watching the nurse climb in with her to keep pumping bags of still-cold blood into her, while the EMTs tore down the road to the other hospital, managing to make killer time while keeping the ride somewhat smooth. My wife would later recall (she is alive and well now) the feeling of security she felt being taken by the nurse and the EMTs. The level of professionalism and genuine care exhibited by the hospital staff, nurse Rose (I'll never forget her name), the surgery team at Doctor's Hospital, and the 2 EMTs that I never got the chance to thank because they had to move on to someone else - it was beyond overwhelming. Drafting through traffic behind that ambulance, if you had told me that day, ""Nurses and EMTs are sent by God himself"" - I wouldn't have argued one bit.

Thanks for helping.

**edit**: Thanks for the (multiple) gold, kind strangers!"
2,"Warning: Rambling and long!

I want to chime in here as a guy who goes both ways, and has experience in the straight and gay dating scene. I feel like we can better understand male-female interactions by comparing them to female-female and male-male interactions.

In my entire adult life (let's say the last 12 years), I have been solicited by women 4 times. By 'solicited' I mean the woman made the first move (in person, not on a dating site), and been very forward about their interest in sex with me in the immediate future. In that same amount of time, I have been solicited by men *every time* I have gone to a gay bar, pride parade, street fair, new years eve party, and several times in bookstores, at work, at concerts, at dive bars, on the street, and once actually had a male flight attendant tell me what hotel he was staying at for the night and give me his phone number. And I'm not particularly effeminate, so these guys either have spectacular gaydar or (more likely) these guys see their forwardness as not being at all rude, even though it only works a small fraction of the time. Important to point out, I am also small enough that I wouldn't pose any kind of threat in the ""What if he's straight and is so offended he's gonna punch me for asking for the dick?"" (aka 'gay-panic') worst case scenario. And yes, it does work sometimes: A select few of those dudes actually took me home. And on the other hand, there's only one or two that stand out as being offensive to me or reacted poorly to my refusal. 99% of the time, they take no for an answer because they know that within the next hour or two some other dude is going to say yes.

When men apply that same tactic towards women it is NOT appreciated. It's seen as completely predatory. In fact, some of the things I've had random dudes say to me at a gay club would get them flat-out pepper sprayed if they'd said it to a woman. Furthermore, straight men are waaaay more likely to get *angry* at a woman for turning them down, or ""leading them on"", or whatever rationale they have for it. Yet they keep trying.

So this gives men the impression that ""women can have sex anytime they want"" because there is a HUGE supply of willing dick... but there's not a demand. So the [dick is abundant and therefor low value](https://medium.com/matter/the-dickonomics-of-tinder-b14956c0c2c7#.1o3d4rid4) (please follow that link, it is amazing). Meanwhile, there is a HUGE demand for pussy, but it's in very small supply.

We can conclude that women have (on average) a higher standard and/or a lower sex drive than men. When I say higher standard, it's not as simple as attractiveness. It's a whole bunch of things, it can be very complicated and encompass a range of emotional and physical needs. Whereas for men, it's often *not even attractiveness*, attractiveness is a plus but all you really need is consent (even if that consent is transactional). Sometimes with men it's literally a hole in the wall that you stick your dick into and some unseen stranger sucks it on the other side. That literally is a thing. There's 4 of them in my town.

I think it says a lot that straight and lesbian culture doesn't have glory holes. And that almost all the lesbian pornography out there is being produced by male directors and sold to a male audience.

Men don't comprehend a womans experience of sexuality very well, so they just imagine ""Well, what if I was a woman?"" and the answer they arrive at is ""Oh my god I'd totally fuck ALL THE TIME. These lucky women, they could be getting head every night from a different person!"" ... as if that is something women want. I won't get into why, but it is obvious that it is not."

4,"She has horrible memory, absolutely awful. 

She once forgot her car. Found it the next day, but still. She forgot that she had driven her car that day and just walked home.


The upside though is that i can reuse jokes a lot and she finds them funny each time"
5,"The secret to long term happiness is to pair up with a woman whose flaws are not going to pose a risk to you or the relationship.

In other words, if you're trying to get to space with your ass intact, who cares if the name of the shuttle is spelled wrong but don't you dare blast off with a leaking fuel tank. 

With that in mind, I married a woman whose imperfections were absolutely trivial. Who cares if she's clumsy and sends a few glasses to their death on the ceramic tiles every year, when she's good with money. Who cares if she's too hasty when fixing a problem (like a stain on the carpet) and makes it worse, when she's incredibly loyal and honest. 

Where people run into trouble is they overlook big flaws in the beginning (like dishonesty or horrible money habits) and think they'll get better when they won't.

Maybe my grandfather instilled some Great Depression era wife criteria in me or something, but I got surprisingly excited when I learned that this girl I had a crush on would can tomatoes from her family garden."

Plenty of demand for that"
9,"My freshmen year in high school, I made a pretty good friend in a class. She was a very nice person and funny. I knew she had some problems at home but never knew how bad.

One night, I'm watching the news with my parents and there's a report about a murder/suicide at a house. Think nothing of it.

The next morning at school, someone came to one of my classes and let us know that my friend had died. I was shocked as I've never had something like this happen. When I found out what happened, I was crushed. She was one of the victims of the report I had seen the night before. Her Dad had a history of being physically abusive towards her and her mom. Her parents got into an argument. He got a gun and shot my friend. Her mom ran out of the house and was shot in the yard. He then blockaded himself in the house and later shot himself.

Devastated as all I say of how I felt. She was friendly, nice, caring. She didn't deserve that. "
10,"I never thought I'd actually be that guy who did something like that... I had all the trust of my wife, her friends, family, and really looking back the payoff want that big. Sure it'd feel good for a minute, but to live with the guilt for the rest of my life, it's hard you know?

Anyway. Story is that we were at a mutual friend's house. We were all drinking, just hanging out. Got to be late in the night, and her friend was giving me this look, and I just kind of shrugged it off. No big deal. But as the night went on and the liquor flowed, it went from looks to dares when my wife wasn't listening or paying attention. Well later on she left the room, had to deal with something in another room. The friend and I both pounced, since there was no one else in the room and we didn't have much time. We went nuts for like 1 minute, when we thought my wife was coming back into the room. Doesn't matter, it was enough time. The wife never suspected a thing, and the rest of the night I just felt like a piece of shit, though the friend had this strange grin.

Worst thing is that I still lost the game... In that minute I only managed to grab a couple hundred, and didn't even swipe anyone else's properties, get out of jail free cards... Only went for the cash. Went bankrupt within half an hour. I'm just such a piece of shit"

12,I'd go places I knew she sometimes went on the off chance that I would run I to her and we would talk. In my head we would talk for a little bit and then we'd go somewhere like a coffee shop and she'd remember why she loved me and we'd get back together. In reality I was a weird creepy stalker ex boyfriend.

15,"I was about 6 and was walking home from  kindergarten with my dad and he gave me $0.30 to get this ice cream I liked. I ran ahead and was happy to be getting my ice cream. I paid for it. It was actually $0.35 when the store owner counted the change he screamed at me, threw the change on my face, reached over grabbed the ice cream and went on some tirade about black people. I didn't know it was a 'thing'.My father came in and asked if I got the ice and the store owner kinda froze. I told him it was 0.35$ and he gave me a whole dollar to get extra. I asked him to pay for it and on the way home told him what happened and gave me the talk. I couldn't understand what it all meant but I felt it was unfair."
16,"I asked my husband. He said he didn't know, I said I'd bug him until he came up with an answer, he said my insistence on pestering him with annoying questions like these."

21,"I'm going with zombies. With a nuclear apocalypse, the water supply is fucked and you have radiation everywhere so you have to wear a hazmat suit and deal with the possibility of your offspring being born with 6 limbs and 3 eyes.

With zombies, you just have to stay away from/kill the zombies and hope you don't get bitten. "
22,"The statement itself is a hyperbole of a real phenomenon. Women's sexuality is more openly accepted than men's, it's true. You're right, a 4/10 woman can't walk into a bar and go home with a 9/10 guy, but she can probably get a guy between 1-6 if she wants. A 4/10 guy who goes into a bar is lucky to have any woman talk to him. Just imagine the different reactions if a woman or a man went up to a stranger and said ""You're so hot, I want you to fuck me"".

So you're right, attractiveness obviously plays a part, but the statement is more about the fact that women generally have more power in dating, sex, and relationships than men. As an attractive guy who has no problem with women, I can still say it's a lot harder. If I'm being social and going out, I get approached maybe once every one or two weeks. My gf gets approached at least once every 30 mins if she's alone.
"
23,"I went into the Army when I was a kid and during Infantry basic training I caught on early that guys who had pictures of pretty girls on the insides of their lockers got off easy on inspections.  The Drill Sergeants would spend more time talking with them about their hot girlfriends than they would looking through their stuff.  I didn't have a girlfriend at home but I did have 7 sisters so I asked them to send pictures.

The only one of my sisters who answered was in a half way house for girls.  She'd had some problems with drugs and been in trouble with the law a few times.  She was the only white girl in the whole place and she sent me pictures of all the pretty black girls that she was living with.

I, of course, am also white but I hung those pictures up because why not.  The first person to notice them was my fellow trainee squad leader.  For whatever reason when he asked who they were, I answered ""those are my sisters.""

He didn't believe me at first and why would he? I'm pale, have straight brown hair and blue eyes.  But I insist. ""Yeah, Mom is Irish and Dad's African American.""  

He looks at me real close and says, ""yeah, I see it now.""

For reasons unknown all of the other squad leaders were also black and all of the sudden I'm part of the very small minority of black guys in our platoon.  They start inviting me to hang out, I got privileges that I didn't have before.  Basic training still sucked but for the rest of my cycle I was part of the in crowd."

27,"My ex lied to me for 5 years while sleeping around with other men behind my back. Funny part is, when I confronted her and asked how she could claim to still love me, yet sleep with other men she had no answer and could only say ""I never thought of it like that"".

She messed me up pretty good because 3 years later I still don't have the confidence to pursue another relationship."

32,"When I think back to the one girl who led me on for a year, telling me she didn't want anything serious but oh hey, can you drive me around and buy me shit because I reeeaaalllly like you?  I don't feel bad at all.  Hell, she probably fucked a number of other guys while we were together.

When I think back on the girl who I thought I was going to marry, I feel like a shithead.  Even though we broke up for unrelated reasons 6 months later it's like, why did I do that?  The one night stand was amazing, I admit that, but what was the point?  Just to prove I could.  It was that whole juvenile, ""Oh my god this girl wants to fuck me and I'm a nerd and no one will ever want to fuck me again"" lack of self confidence from when I was younger that reared it's ugly head."

In the years that I have been with my (black) wife, I have witnessed some subtle but ugly episodes that as a white guy never would have imagined still would happen in the US in the 21st century. It's fucking heartbreaking that you have to deal with that every day of your life.

Sometimes when it happens I don't even catch on, it's only in review or my wife saying something that I realize what happened. Just makes no sense to me."
50,"I'm a 17-year-old dude. I have the opportunity to look at this with a less jaded view. So hear me out. '

My dad had an affair. I found out about it when I was around 6. And it taught me a lot about the way people behave and the way they see their actions. It's always very interesting to stumble on a thread like this. Because one thing about human psychology is extremely apparent. We rarely ever blame anything solely on ourselves. Dale Carnegie talked about this in How to Win Friends and Influence People. There's always some reason, like ""He didn't love me  enough,"" or, ""There were so many problems in the relationship that she didn't realize,"" and so on. But it's usually people who have cheated who come up with this. My guess is that they come up with all these explanations AFTER the cheating. I doubt any of the guys on here went through exactly why they were cheating before they did. They felt ""bad"" after the fact and thought, ""Well, I'm awesome, so there must be a reason. Let's see. Why did I do this?"" Then they come up with something. I notice these things in myself too whenever I do something I know I shouldn't have. 

I'd also like to point out that cheating isn't a ""mistake"" like a lot of people seem to think it is. It's a few dozen mistakes that happen over period of time. Even if you cheat with a one night stand, it's not like one minute you noticed someone was attractive and the next minute you two were fucking. There were MANY decisions you made that led to that. And you fucked up with every single one of those decisions...on purpose.

So yeah, be honest with yourself. "
51,"When I got arrested for a crime I did not commit, purely based on what a little girl thought she saw and her family's insistence that I be incarcerated. I ended up not getting a job a few months after the fact because the nolle prosse thing still came up on a background check.

52,"That's how I snagged my boyfriend. Random events kept having us meet up so one night I messaged him on Facebook with a joke to break the ice. After a while of messaging each other all hours of the day and night, I went out with some girlfriends and gave him the option of picking me up to drive me home or regret not getting me by the morning. He picked me up, we drove around for hours laughing and talking. When I was sobered up 6 hours later to drive my vehicle home, I got out and told him ""This is what we're doing from now on"" and left. Years later with a new baby and home renos, no regrets.

53,"I got initiated in 2011 and live in the west coast. The shit we did during the semester leading up to what is known as ""hell week"" isn't bad. Since we can decide to leave at any point, they usually don't make you do anything TOO crazy before hell week. I got initiated with 22 other guys, and one of them tried to quit during hell week but at that point you've seen the worst of the worst so they don't really allow you to leave until you become initiated. As far as drinking goes, it's not forced but it's definitely encouraged.

I never ended up saying anything to my mom, all I did was cry on the phone for about 10 to 30 minutes (I didn't have any sense of time), while she tried to comfort me even though she has no idea, zero, what happened and why I'm crying.

I eventually stopped and hanged up, she immediately called my grandma and woke her up, who then proceeded to my room, I cried again, for a long ass time, I managed to tell her what happened, vaguely anyway, and like my mom, she just said things that I needed to hear.

It's been almost a decade, but my uncle (he's only 5 yrs older than me so we're kinda close) has been telling every person he knows whenever I'm around to hear him share it, it always makes for a funny story. I do hope, he never mentions it to one particular friend, because I'm interested in her and I'd like to be the one to tell that story when the time is right."

Probably because you've never exploited your capabilities and opportunities. Or wanted to. Women are typically much pickier than men, too, and actively go looking for flaws to rule someone out when their interest is just a fuck.

Try genuinely inviting your male friends over for a bootycall or to Netflix and chill. The results will probably surprise you and be yawn-inducingly common to men."

Oh look that random thing I wanted is on sale. 

I wonder if I could build a helicopter in my garage

Eh not worth the probable drama. 

Hope neither one notices me checking her out. 

Wonder if I'm gonna figure out a way to get some tonight

99,"&gt;Furthermore, straight men are waaaay more likely to get angry at a woman for turning them down, or ""leading them on"", or whatever rationale they have for it. Yet they keep trying.

Which is really quite scary sometimes. I knew a guy who used to throw a tantrum if a girl didn't want to go home with him at the end of the night after she'd been dancing with him for a long time or hanging out all night and it's actually really disconcerting and sometimes legitimately frightening to be on the receiving end of stuff like this, especially when the person is drunk. 

Stuff like that makes women less likely to approach men, in my experience. It would be a lot easier if you know that you could you talk to a guy and if you realize you don't like him after all, he's definitely not going to flip out on you or call you gender slurs."

103,"It was the most unreasonable situation; little girl saw me standing by a bike rack while I waited for my younger brother. He had just turned 18, so we were gonna walk to the nearby corner store and grab some stogies. We walk to this place and he goes inside to buy em. I sit at a table outside because the weather's nice and I didn't bring my wallet. About five-ish minutes after sitting down, a posse of some 10 people ALL riding bikes come up and surround me. It was some two families staying together. I think two were teenagers, two kids, and several adults of varying ages. For how ridiculous this sounds, I couldn't believe it myself. They start accusing me (and my brother once he came out of the store) of stealing their bike... which we had never seen. They're trying to interrogate us to ""just fess up and tell [them] where the black bike is."" This goes on for a bit before they mention they already had a cop at the place and will just have us all talk to them. So, they 'escort' my brother and I back to that particular bike rack and we speak with the cop. I hadn't had to deal with cops before, but I said exactly what my understanding was; I hadn't touched any bike and neither did my brother. 

We do some more waiting until the cop somehow decides to arrest me, probably due to the older fuckface who kept saying he wanted to press charges. I don't understand it all still. My brother gets to go... so I told him he was going to be the one to pick me up since he saw everything that happened. I ended up riding about an hour away to the county jail to sit around and wait until about 1:30ish in the morning for the jail to get their shit together and give me my phone call. The cops in that jail were so awful to one another... I finally get picked up and get back around 3:30. Miserable. Ruined our vacation. On top of that, my best friend of the time was there with us and I'm almost certain that's what led to him fading out of my life. 

All because some little girl thought I was trying to steal one of their other bikes or something? Ugh.

112,"In general terms I would say the sexual heirarchy looks like this:

-Attractive women

-Average women

-Attractive men

-Average men

-Unattractive women

-Unattractive men

They have an edge at every level. Since we'll assume most guys are in the ""average"" range - they are 3 levels behind attractive men and women, and average women, in terms of sexual options. Anyone who is unattractive, is going to have trouble finding love, but if we're comparing what average women can get versus average men? It's no contest, as some here have already said."
113,"When I went to college. I grew up lower middle class, had to take on a lot of debt to get an education I wanted, and watched that debt actually hurt my job hunt (had to work 40 hours a week just to get by, had trouble getting time off, credit checks on a few jobs destroyed me, etc).

Meanwhile, friends who came from families that paid tuition straight up are currently working, found jobs relatively quickly, as many of them didn't have to have a day job, their bills were covered until they found something.

I don't blame them, but man, I'm envious."
114,"First break up was super cringey. For context, she hooked up with one of my best friends in a very public way about a week after we broke up. It happened at a dance they went to as a couple, so there were pictures of it all over facebook. It was pretty humiliating, I got texts from people being like ""Uh why is one of your best friends with your girl?"" - I found out the hooking up started happening while we were still together, they just now felt free to be public about it.

I kept pining after her for months, trying to convince her of how miserable I was so that she'd feel guilty and responsible. I desperately wanted everyone to know how shitty she was and it bothered me to no end that her life was actually really good and she didn't really face negative consequences. I couldn't get over the injustice of it all. 

I'd get really mad at her if she stopped a conversation in the middle or fell asleep while we (really just me) were trying to 'talk something out.' I left her a birthday present (card and candy) to try to solidify an actual friendship. I used to have borderline panic attacks when I thought I saw her somewhere.

I continued to lean on her for other things because I just wanted her to feel bad, honestly, and a little because I missed her. 

Eventually I went to college and just didn't care anymore. Now I'm several years removed from it and it seems comical that I ever cared so much. I've been through more breakups from more serious relationships and they haven't affected me nearly as much because I've grown up tremendously. Nothing like your first one, folks. "
115,Don't use it then.
116,"That was nice to read, thank you for sharing. I'm glad your wife is doing well "
117,"Her smell.

We were studying together in a small enclosed room and her scent completely caught me off guard. I don't have a strong nose so I had never believed in the power of pheromones.

But the longer we were in the tiny office together, the more I realized I just kept fantasizing about picking her up and laying her on the table. It got to the point where I couldn't think straight and was stammering over my sentences with how suddenly attracted to her I was. So I excused myself from the room, splashed cold water on my face in the bathroom, and asked if ""wouldn't it be better if we studied on a picnic table outside?""

Good ending: we later dated for over a year before deciding we weren't going anywhere together and remained friends. But the smell-attraction never wore off.

Edited to add, other things:

1) choker necklaces

2) and this is embarrassing to admit, but when other dudes/women find her attractive. It wakes up some shitty cromagnon alpha male gene in me that just makes me want to assert myself. I keep it in check but in the interest of being honest to myself have to admit it's a part of me."
118,"She is incredibly anti-social with other people, has very few friends and gets exhausted spending too much time with family. I get her out of the house to visit family but make sure I can get her home after a reasonable time frame and ensure she can relax once she gets there. This means I do a disproportionate amount of chores and have to regularly sacrifice my own free time but it's worth it to keep her happy and in touch with other people. Beyond that she's about as close to flawless as I ever expect to find and I'd fall on a sword for her. "

My one best friend Jon/Amanda are getting married next year. I have been through 3 girlfriends since they met and I was there on their first Valentine's day on a double date. Amanda gets $1,000 bonus checks a month, will soon be a DM for a pretty big company. Jon is also doing well. They have a fucking awesome house and are talking kids.

My other best friend Joe married Becky last year. They have the best 2 year old I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. They are looking for a house. I spend a lot of time with Joe and Becky together, and one on one. They're awesome people.

I'm still working on my bachelors. I have no dating prospects. I live at home still. I have my own hobbies and success despite not being on the same time frame as them.

My advice? They're your fucking friends. Get the fuck out of your head because you're being a complete idiot about the situation. If you want to ruin your friendships because you feel inadequate then you're honestly an idiot.

Want honesty? I bet those guys have no fucking clue what they're doing and they're probably not as happy as you'd think. People put on their best for public. It's human nature. 

Again, don't ruin good friendships because you feel inadequate. Worry about you and be thankful you have people who show care towards you and want to spend time with you. I know I'm super thankful that I have such awesome friends despite them being more ""successful"" than me.

You're going to be an engineer, you've got your priorities in order, just a bit slower than them. You're fine dude. I promise. 

And yes, this is some tough love, stop being so hard on yourself. People don't care how much you make or where you are in life. They want to spend time with you because they enjoy who you are as a person. Own it."

134,"I've been trying for a while to figure out how to word this, but basically:

I show I care in open ways. I like to hold hands, random hugs and kisses, getting a small something they like (like a bag of candy or a soda or something) if I'm out and about, I text a good amount, all that jazz. I dunno how others show they care, but I lean towards physical affection and acts of kindness. The big thing, though, is that I don't hold it back. Like, I know how I love, and I accept how I love and go with that without worrying about being clingy or whatever. I want a girl who loves me in the same way, and if she has any reservations about showing that love (doesn't wanna seem need/clingy/desperate, etc.), it's not going to work, period. Let it out, be uninhibited about how you feel. Don't hold back because you're embarrassed or think I'll find you clingy or something."
135,always does
136,"There were virtually no men in her family. All of the women had been divorced at least once, if not multiple times. All these women talked about men as if they were all idiots, though I could tell they tended to date men without many redeeming qualities. 

They looked at men as impermanent and disposable. Her mother may have been the worst. She would date a guy for a few months, move in with him, and then another month or two later move out, while taking a bunch of his shit with her. It was such a terrible coven of secondhand furniture. "

145,"And vice versa too. That minor flaw your SO has? It's probably not worth breaking up over. No one is ever going to be and do 100% of everything you could ever want and need 100% of the time.

Just think about this: there are minor flaws they're willing to overlook for you too. You owe them that much in return rather than nitpicking or mocking every little thing they do. The kind of people who are unable to do this often wind up being the ones complaining because they're constantly alone."
146,"You're thinking too small. You're thinking that guy's talking about you, saying something about you. He ain't. When someone calls you nigger, they're telling you nothing about you, but a whole hell of a lot about themselves. A lot of the reason you get angry about it is because you've been told that you should. But words only have the power that you give them. The word ""nigger"" has a ton of bad connotations, but they're all historical bullshit with no basis in reality. That jackass calling you a nigger online doesn't mean anything other than that he's a hateful jackass bigot who's opinion ain't worth shit. Why would you give a half a damn what that guy thinks? Just because he believes something is true doesn't make it true. People believe in some crazy ass shit. 

And of all the racist things you're going to have to deal with in your life, being called a nigger in passing is just about the last thing you should be worried about. The only reason I can think that you would get upset about it is at the fact that such bigoted thinking still exists at all, but that's like being mad that tornadoes are a thing. There's always going to be hate and there's always going to be people who hate on you specifically for something you got no control over. If it wasn't for your race, it'd be for something else just as dumb. If you really want to be mad about something race related, be mad about something that could actually have some kind of real effect on you, not some asshole's ignorant internet bullshit. And really, why get mad at all? The best revenge is a life well lived, which means there's fucking work to do."

152,"Former EMT. 

You clean the ambulance after every run. It doesn't matter if it's the end of your shift or not, if there's blood all over the back you're cleaning it before you put another patient back there. Even if your patient wasn't expelling any manner of bodily fluid you still had to change the sheets, clean any trash (mostly packaging for single-use medical equipment), and wipe down with disinfectant. 

Typically the driver would clean the back while the person who worked the patient was writing up the run-report at the hospital. Person who worked the patient and wrote the run report would also restock after they finished writing. If it was really bad, the person who wrote the report and restocked would also help clean once they finished those other two tasks. But yes, the EMT themselves did the cleaning. It's a major part of the job.

In between calls you might clean the outside of the ambulance if it needed it and restock things you couldn't do at the hospital (typically things like changing out the oxygen tanks if the onboard O2 was getting low). Maybe do a more in-depth cleaning if the ambulance was due for it, it was a REALLY bad call, or you were having a slow day.  "
153,Yes.
154,"It's never happened to me but close friends have gone through it and the one shocking thing I learned was that the cheating had very little reflection on their happiness inside the relationship.

155,"Let's break it down. Tough love style. 

You are married. You have been married for 3 years. Don't try and reframe it away from the facts. 

And, apparently, you're a selfish son of a bitch. She stood by you through pain, surgery, and recovery and while you worked your way through school. Now she wants her turn and you don't want to do the same for her.

You have what many dream about: a loving, supportive spouse. She is even standing by your indecisiveness. 

Forget about another wedding. You're married. Just tell everyone and have a party.

158,"As man, the expectations laid on you by everybody are endless and you will never be able to fulfill all of them because many represents conflicted requirements. I am not bitter, I am in fact very happy. Some of the points below may be exaggerations or sarcastic in nature.

The government is simple. All they want from me is to make money so I can pay taxes, preferably a lot of taxes. They also want me to serve in the army so they can put my head on the line if necessary. Of course if I die I won't be able to pay taxes anymore so there's that. Ideally, I pay lots of social security and die on the day of my retirement. Everybody else can then profit off of me (women in particular live longer than men, but men still have to work longer and thus pay more in my country).

Society as a whole is more complicated. From a young age, men are told basically not to behave like boys but at the same time remain boys. Don't fight but be strong. Vocalize your emotions but don't be a girl or sissy. Girls are exactly like you except you can't do this or that. We grow up in a society that is very inconsistent for boys because somebody feels it is wrong for them to  act like boys at times. Everything has to be debated. When we grow up, it doesn't stop. Society gives us little but expects us to give back so much in return. In school, we get no preferred treatment while girls do. But somehow, nobody expects a girl who did good in school to become a scientist or engineer while guys who are encouraged to go into arts are laughed at later. Arts major? Have fun working at McDonald's. You're worthless if you don't make tons of money and how are you going to support a family? Does the average woman get this question?

Women seem even more complicated because what they expect is very ambivalent. At times it seems they don't know what they want from men. They look for a breadwinner while they can spend their own money, manual laborer who is good with computers, great cook and house man who does the dishes and keeps the house clean, funny, intelligent, charming, handsome guy, but not too handsome as not to attract other women, who never cries or voices negative emotions but somehow is an emotional being and capable of never ending empathy, who will always do as told except in the bedroom where he's a total lion king and puts even the great Rocco to shame. Oh, and obviously he must not have any expectations himself.

**tl;dr**: The expectations put on you slowly turn you into a sarcastic being. Select a few and try to live up to them but don't try to make everybody else happy because it will make you sad."

161,"I grew up fundamentalist. I had no idea, but I was also abused as a child.

I'd been told my whole life I deserved punishment. I believed that the bad things that happened to me happened because I, like all humans, was inherently sinful and had rebelled against God (or my parents). Loneliness, depression, self-hatred, and all the other symptoms of childhood abuse were simply because I was a bad person and deserved to suffer. I believed that my duty was to grit my teeth and bear the suffering because eventually God would make everything okay.

Then I realized I had been abused. And I started therapy. And I started healing. And I realized God either let the abuse happen and left me in the dark for 30 years, or there was no God.

It was tremendously freeing to realize that bad things happen *for no reason*, and that it *wasn't my fault* that I suffered. The universe is not just and what I experienced was not the result of some cosmic judge making me suffer for my crimes. I didn't earn the abuse. The benefits of life I now enjoy because of where I was born were not earned, either. We're all masters of our own fate to some extent, and victims of circumstance in other ways. It is okay to want good things and to defend what I have.

I know a lot of people in this thread are going to post about bad stuff that taught them the world wasn't nice. But for someone that was taught the fairness of the universe meant a panopticon of suffering and pain, an apathetic and uncaring universe is a tremendous joy."
162,"Assertiveness. I'm 28, and up until meeting my current girlfriend, most of the girls I was attracted to were a little shy and awkward  (I'm a big nerd, so it kinda follows logically).

Then my now-gf and I met, and she asked me out and laid out via text how she wasn't interested in dating games or conventional crap, and that she thought we might work out so why not give it a try? I was very blown away, and I still have a lot of respect for her ability to take initiative. It's not something I commonly see with women, and she knows I'm a bit introverted and she's fine with that.

172,"I generally don't give a shit what people think so don't pay them any attention. She will point out someone leering at us in public, talking in hushed tones, and even pointing. Very obvious what you're talking about and thinking. 

A few times something has been 'closed'  or what have you, and the other person handles the situation in such a way that it's not something I would encounter if I were alone. Subtle, but there's usually something off that sets off my spider sense.

Waitstaff have made strange comments sometimes, such as ""How INTERESTING that you two are together..."". 

One fathers' day we went out with a few couples in a group. The waiter handed ALL of the (white) wives their cards back to them except for my wife, who had handed him the card in the first place and whose name was on the damn thing.

Black people can be some of the most overtly racist people out there, I've found. But it's not like white people racism in that I don't really get snubbed, but they give my wife shit and snub HER for marrying 'outside the race' or whatever. She deals with a surprising amount of that. 

That all said, most people absolutely don't give a shit, so that's good. "

I made up a load of shit that she said and did to me in the bathroom one day. There was no one else in the bathroom so there was no one to say she didn't do it and my school had a no bullying policy so they believed me and obviously thought she was lying to get out of trouble. She got in school suspension for three days and I got everyone to start calling her ""lunatic"" which was a play on her last name.

Turned out that I was the lunatic. "

178,"I'm sure this will be pretty far down and most likely not read but I'm going to share it anyways. 

When I was 8 years old, poor as fuck and living in rural Oregon we ran out of food 3 days before we could get money for gas so we could drive into town to visit the food bank. My mom and stepdad both had jobs but my stepdad was in logging and work was sporadic even though he was guaranteed a steady job when we moved there. Mom was an ambulance dispatcher and not making enough to carry us.    

Anyways, my moms relief was running late so she couldn't pick me up from school one day so a friend said I could go home with him until she got off. 

Huge, clean, warm, beautiful house. His mom didn't work and had snacks ready for us when we got there. I still  remember that the ""snacks"" were ham and cheese sandwiches with mayo, mustard, lettuce, sprouts and tomato with no crust. One each with chips. 

I only ate half of mine so I could give my other half to my mom and asked for some aluminum foil to wrap it up. My friends mom said if I wasn't hungry it was okay and I could ""just  throw it out, honey"". I started bawling.

The question was ""What made you realize life was not fair?"",  well, my friends dad got home before my mom got there to pick me up. Later than night I found out he was the manager that hired my step-dad promising a full time job.        "
179,"The initiation is just a ceremony, maybe some robes, silly hats, and candles, but it's nothing that is strange or crazy.  

Now the hazing during pledge semester and hell week are a whole other beast.  

I went greek in the 90's so I have no idea what it's like today.  
I ate goldfish, went on crazy road trips, stole all sorts of things, streaked parties, drank until I puked or blacked out or both.  

There are lots of mind fucks, like jumping on tacks and other stuff I don't remember.

During Hell Week we didn't shower or sleep much, didn't change our clothes and we had to swap underwear with a pledge brother everynight, and they would rotate out some of the underwear with girls panties.  

We did things like a burrito relay, shotgun a warm can of beer (like warm not just room temp), sprint 200 yards, eat a taco bell burrito sprint back and shotgun a second warm beer.  We found out later that even if the beer or running didn't make you puke, they had put Copenhagen in the burritos.  We were lined up near a trash can in a way that we ended up puking on each other.  

Lots of super gross stuff, but it was tempered with fun stuff too.  

The thing about Fraternities is the Lord of the Flies behavior. The older guys are always saying how much worse it was back in the day, so the younger guys just try to out do that. Or if one guy does something, the next guy tries to go further, this is how boys often behave, but in a group of 3-5 friends it dies out and they move on, when it goes through 30-50 iterations the behavior gets really bad.

TL:DR Fraternities are different from each other and at different schools, it's not for everyone, but there are a lot of potential positives. As was said elsewhere, do your homework."
180,"What sort of zombies, and what sort of nukes are we talking about here?

Are the zombies supernatural, spore-borne, or a mystery? How fast are they? How smart are they? I'd have a much easier time making this decision if I knew whether the it leant more on the Walking Dead side of things or the 28 Days Later side, considering the disparity of danger between those types of zombies.

As far as the nukes go, are we dealing with Fallout-style ""SCIENCE!"" where the dangers are mostly about as scientifically accurate as 50s Sci-Fi B-Movies, or are we dealing with hyper-realistic nuclear winter like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.? I need to know whether or not I can reasonably create solutions to the challenges of this new world based on my current knowledge."

Again, not worth the risk! Don't take that kind of chance. The stakes are too high, you have to trust your gut. But also be kind, because you don't want to make her feel crazy for the very normal behaviour of using the bathroom right after sex."

I'm not sure how it is, I'm happy with who I am and don't really care if I don't fit in the norm.

Edit: I'm actually going to add that I was really insecure in my masculinity in the ages 15-16. I was in a class with 15 girls &amp; 2 guys, most of my friends were female and I had interests in arts which often isn't very well regarded among young men. I'd like to think I grew out of caring what people thought &amp; the people around me also grew up and stopped caring. I just realized who I was and began feeling okay with it. Honestly after a while of just doing the things I liked instead of thinking about the stigma I just got used to it. Nobody really cares, I guess realizing that helped.

Friend of mine was considered even more effeminate than me, and he had a harder time. Lots of female friends asking you if you could be their ""gay best friend"" without knowing anything about your sexuality. Just projected their view of the world onto you.

There's always some stigma about showing emotion as a man, but honestly fuck anyone who tries to shame you for it, they're not worth your time. It tends to get better as people grow up as welm."

222,"Every time women ask something like this here, it seems like they're looking for a way to put themselves out there without actually putting themselves out there. They're looking for some way to convey interest while maintaining plausible deniability after the fact.

It doesn't work that way. If you want the payoff, you'll have to risk rejection. You'll have to assume some vulnerability. There's no way around this. It's simply a consequence of revealing your interest in someone. You'll have to accept the idea that it might not go the way you want it to. The other person is under no obligation to reciprocate your interest, and you have little control over how they are going to react.

The only real trick here is to employ the same level of discretion, tact, and poise that you would strive for in any other social situation. Be genuine, don't be duplicitous, don't hide behind subterfuge. Men and women tend to have vastly different ideas of what constitutes ""creepiness."" We're more likely to creeped out by situations rather than specific people. We tend to place more emphasis on directness in conversation. This doesn't mean you get to abandon all pretense of social grace, it just means that we get pretty damn weary of people who continually try to dance around the point.

If you want something, go for it. Maybe it will go your way, maybe it won't. If the guy in question is already into you, you can get away with a lot of fumbling and awkwardness. 
"
223,"Yeah, it's not okay to waste people's time. That's shitty. But the punishment often doesn't fit the crime. 

Like sorry I wasted your time buddy and then realized I don't want to go home with you because you did something that makes you seem like a jerk and now I'm trying to be polite instead of just telling you that (because you might react badly), but it's not okay to follow me around yelling that I'm a ""gender slur"" for any amount of time.

When the time comes, hold him, the entire time, you're his human as much as he is your dog, don't bitch out on him because you're scared, be there for him until the very end, you know what's about to happen, he has no idea.

251,"When I was 20, I was battling a fairly deep depression, and was lost in that transition from child to adult. I lied to almost all my friends and family that I had joined the Army and was doing basic training at Fort Benning. My girlfriend, whom I later married, and I were communicating periodically via email. I told her I got computer privileges because of good behavior. 

The entire time, I was at my friends house across town, living there with no job and not even looking for one, like the loser I was at the time. I got caught when, after pulling this ruse for nearly three months, my mom told my girlfriend that she called Fort Benning to find out where to write me and when I would be graduating, only to find out that there was no record of me even being there. 

One of the scariest moments of my life to that point was the moment I received an email from my SO demanding me to tell her what the fuck was really going on. She was completely beside herself when I told her I was still in town. 

There were a lot of lies within the lie, but damn I was so relieved afterward that I had gotten caught. "

I got off on it too though. That she would so deliberately swallow my cum as in a ritual, it really got my blood flowing. I'm all into being really dominant so it was perfect. She was honouring me.

Goddamm. "
257,"No, we are not inserting an unspoken ""attractive"".

If you are female and have even partially functioning orifices, you can find a sex partner.

258,Here's an idea.  QUIT FUCKING HER YOU IDIOT!
259,"I would want to have sex more often with her, like 5 times a week. About 3 times a week is still pretty decent and I am happy.

In the moment it's annoying, but upon reflection I genuinely don't mind.
Everyone recieves love in different ways. For me, I need to hear words of affection and to be told how much I'm appreciated. For her, its having her significant other do things to help out and make her happy. 
There's another that isn't neccessarily a flaw, just a difference in personality, but I don't talk very much unless I'm really really into something. She can talk for hours without stopping, and if I don't reply sometimes she gets mad, and its not that I'm not paying her attention I just don't talk. "
263,"Let me tell you about my horrible sixth grade maths teacher.

I was a fairly bright kid, and always among the top five of the ""high"" clustered class. Primary school went swimmingly, but in Middle School I had to face Mrs. X. Now, Mrs. X had a reputation for being strict but fair, so I was excited. Strict but fair teachers were by far my favorite, because they kept asshole classmates in line, but generally trusted us to experiment more and learn in abstract ways.

The ""fair"" portion of Mrs. X was overstated, I came to find out.

From day one it seemed that she didn't like me. Before each lesson was taught, she liked to see if anyone knew how to do these complex new problems on the board. Being our first introduction to true algebra, we, of course, did not. I could count on being the one called up to face a seemingly random smattering of numbers, letters, and symbols on the board. However, whenever we had free flowing discussion, my raised hand was never called on. So my questions were never answered, and my confusion was never cleared.

I remember in one discussion, we (for some reason in a maths class) were grouping traits of dogs and traits of cats and talking about their differences. In a rare deviation from the norm, I was called on and said, ""Claws.""

""No,"" Mrs. X dismissed, ""Both have claws."" With a shake of her head she immediately called on someone else.

""No ma'am,"" I persisted, ""I meant they have different types of claws.""

""That's silly, they both have claws.""

""But cat's claws can go away,"" I said, not being able to articulate the word ""retractable"" while standing up to an authority figure.

Mrs. X laughed. She fucking laughed at me causing classmates to laugh. Friends to laugh. 

""Where do you think they go?"" 

Of course at this point I was defeated even though I knew I was right. And even some of my friends said later they agreed with me. The ones that laughed.

But the kicker, the thing that sticks in my mind the most is goddamn Math Crunchers. The first one of us to finish our work without mistake could play Math Crunchers (a silly educational maths computer game with aliens). I remember standing from my desk and walking to hers. Waiting patiently, to not interrupt her as her head was down, focused on some work. By the time she looked up, two people had queued behind me. 

Mrs. X took a look at the girl's paper behind me. She missed a couple.

I held my paper out to her.

She took the paper of the boy who had been third. He missed some.

She graded mine and I got a check mark at the top of the sheet. Not a 100 with a ""Wow!"" like other students received. Just a check mark.

""May I play Math Crunchers?"" I asked.

""No,"" Mrs. X replied without looking up.

I was crushed.

""But,"" I said, ""I got everything right.

""I said no, don't argue with your teacher."" I remember her not looking up. Refusing to even look at me.

Furious, defeated, wronged, I slowly went back to my desk and put my head down. 

A few minutes later I saw a girl sitting at the computer playing Math Crunchers.

This was the last AP maths class I was in. By the time I reached reached High School I was adequate in maths. At university, I squeaked into my College Algebra class when I most likely should have taken a remedial class. Because I stopped trying in sixth grade. And was slightly behind in seventh. More so in eighth.

Because Mrs. X was a horrible teacher and a worse person."

276,"I didn't have a girlfriend until after college.

Why?  

Well, during my teen years, I was too ashamed that my father would tease me if I brought a girl home.  During college in the city, I mostly had zero social skills.  I finished college in a more rural area while living with my mom, so yeah, that put on a damper on things (even though in hindsight, my mom really wouldn't have cared).

Finally got my groove on after college when I moved a couple hundred miles away for my first real job.  Started online dating and probably went out with more women in 3 months than my ""experienced"" friends did in their entire lives.  

That was about 15 years ago.  Have dated, had relationships, and had sex pretty consistently since then.  

Trust me, it doesn't matter what happened in high school or college.  You aren't ""permanently behind"" when it comes to relationships.  "
277,"3.5 years together. Can't really think of any flaws. She had flaws, like being too clingy, unwillingness to work out, tendency to neglect her other friends to be only with me. We talked about all these things, I wanted to be supportive instead of demanding, as she is with me, and now I really can't imagine life without her."
278,"She still has panics from her last relationship due to how messed up they were, so sometimes she gets panicky and asks me bizarre questions, wondering if I'm angry at her.  The last one was if I was angry at her that she decided to wear makeup one day.  I had no idea why that would be... evidently one of her exes had gotten really pissed when she wore makeup.

Generally speaking, this just results in me getting a little confused and then giving her a hug (and asking why, exactly, I would be angry about this).  She gets this shy little smile though, like she's just realized everything's going to be okay each time.  And then she relaxes, and everything's fine.

The other thing is when we wrestle she steals my wallet and pulls my armpit hair.  Dating people with siblings is hard... they know all sorts of annoying tricks like that!"

288,"That is common. I know it's tough, but don't let her decisions devalue you because it really is like a sick person choosing other sick people over a healthy person. If anything, and pondering upon this point, try to find some solace in it, and it's that in the psychology of attraction, generally speaking, emotionally healthy people are attracted to emotionally healthy people and emotionally unhealthy people are attracted to emotionally unhealthy people. I think that it ultimately comes down to how we subconsciously interpret this concept of 'love'. 


Generally, when a person, a girl in this case, doesn't receive enough emotional validation and attentive love and care from her primary caregivers, particularly her father, then the child feels a sense of abandonment. This abandonment, because of how vulnerable children are, triggers our death instinct, and so we respond with fear which is felt as anxiety. But also because of how vulnerable children are we interpret that everything our parents do to us is love, and so we associate that feeling of anxiety with love; that is what love feels like. 


As adults our attractions are most strongly based on the subconscious factors. We have an uncanny affinity towards those who remind us of our childhood image of our parents. We subconsciously pick up on the patterns of abandonment behavior exhibited by a person who we are romantically interested in that reminds us of our parents. If her father was physically abusive then she is subconsciously choosing partners who will abuse her and abandon her in the same way, that is the premise of her attraction. These attractions are felt as that deep sense of longing, to fill a void of emptiness and pain. It's our inner child's attempt at changing the outcome with our parents so that we may finally feel loved. This is called validation seeking, when we lack a sense of self-value such that we search for it external to ourselves. It's the role of parents to instill in their children self-value, which leads to psychological and emotional independence and confidence in adulthood. But parents, because of their own emotional hunger and insecurity, drain their children of their emotional resources by using them as a source of validation and an outlet for their own sense of longing and need and unhealthy emotions. 


There are unhealthy attractions, what Page calls attractions of deprivation, and healthy attractions, what he calls attractions of inspiration. Attractions of deprivation tend to be that neurotically driven sense of need, that we need to have this person in order to be complete. Unfortunately, popular culture valorizes that as love, we see this in music and movies, but all it is is emotional hunger. The dangerous thing about it though is that emotionally hungry people can drain other people of their emotional resources. So in the case that a person who is securely attached is in a relationship with someone who is anxiously attached or avoidant-attached, the insecurity and emotional hunger of the latter two can drain the former thus reducing them to an insecure attachment style as well. So in the long run, a lot of times when these relationships don't work out because one of the people is just so emotionally damaged is actually a good thing for the other person. There's only so much energy that can be drained from another person that the relationship just becomes incredibly toxic.

1. There was a secret santa, but presents were required to be fifths of alcohol. One brother would dress up as Santa and each brother had to sit on his lap and drink the fifth until he'd finished it. This was enforced.

2. Each year the new brothers would kidnap one of the brothers who was a graduating senior. The kidnapped brother would be forcibly taken, locked up somewhere, and supplied with nothing but drugs and alcohol until the rest of the brothers found him.

305,"Eh, Reddit has a sort of fickle opinion on these things. Pretty much always. I've seen two completely contradictory posts (One saying it's ""definitely a red flag"" and the other saying ""it's a red flag when someone says it's a red flag"") both have thousands of upvotes with just one day in between. So I wouldn't put much store in any answer given in this post. But for the sake of discussion, I guess it's always good that people answer, and I'll do the same.

In my personal opinion it matters. It's a fetish thing. I'm definitely monogamous and that monogamy extends into the bedroom. Sexual adventurousness is good, but only up to a certain point. Threesomes with random strangers (I don't do strangers, but whatever) is fine, but to involve someone else in the bedroom in a relationship? To me, I see that as a form of cuckholding which is such a huge turn-off for me I almost get angry when I happen to stumble upon it randomly on the internet. To sum up; cuckholding is a fetish and to me three-/moresomes comes close to it. When fetishes are too incompatible then a relationship becomes difficult.

Furthermore, I don't want to know that my girlfriend fantasizes about sex with someone else. If she brings up having a threesome that's pretty much what that is. No thank you.

Done it in the past? Okay. If she liked it then perhaps that's going to be something she wants again? Now it's a problem for me. So yes, it can be a problem.

I'd say your friend is way off, though. There are definitely a lot of men up for it. And yeah, he did seem like a bit of a hypocrite."
306,"Currently my SO is the same height as me, like literally the exact same height.  But I have dated a few girls who were taller.

That makes me feel a little bad that I limit their wardrobe, but honestly it's up to them in what they wanna wear."
307,"I did tech support in a call center for like 5 years. The job itself was unpleasant, but easy, it was the management that drove me insane.

During every evaluation they would find something wrong. It would be some metric that they never brought up before. Nothing could end on a positive note, ever. 

They liked to switch your schedule around twice a year, so you could be working Jan-June 8-5 M-F and then end up spending the Rest of the year working 5 to Midnight to with Sunday and Thursday off. 

If you tried to book a week or more of PTO they would just deny random days, I'll never forget having to call into take a sick day from Dublin. My supervisor knew I was in Ireland, but told me I absolutely had to call anyway. 

One time on the Saturday morning shift, the manager forgot his key. As a result, nobody was able to get into the building before 7:15A (start time was 7). We all got written up for being late. On another instance, their computers fucked up over night and the clocks ended up being 10 minutes fast, rather than use common sense and forgive people who punched in 10 minutes ""late"" they wrote people up for being on time, saying we should have known the clocks were messed up.

The final straw came when I got in trouble for having an unopened can of soup on my desk. Some guy I had never seen before insisted that I go put it in the refrigerator because ""It could spill"" and then tried to write me up for signing off the phones for a few minutes to go do what he asked.

I think this says a lot though. You have to ask yourself, why would she go out of her way to intentionally make the most hurtful statement she could think of? Because she was hurting, not because it was true. If you really didn't matter to her, she wouldn't have been motivated to be so hurtful. She doesn't choose her words based on reality, but based on the effect they have on the person she is talking to. A lot of cheaters are like that, in my experience."

317,"I should clarify, I consider anything a girl does to begin an interaction as ""approaching"". Only a few have actually straight up asked me for my number or something like that.

On a side note, I have no idea why everyone's opinion towards the matter is ""eh, the past is the past. It doesn't matter."" For practically everything else, past behavior matters. How else do we judge a person? If you have a past of being abusive for instance, I'm not going to be going ""ah, the past is the past. That has no bearing on who they are now. It's whatever"" so it makes absolutely no sense to me how it having been done in the past makes it irrelevant today."

336,"""If she cheated with you she will cheat on you""

You have no idea how often I have said this in conversations similar to this discussion. Sometimes from younger friends discussing their situations or general conversation. A large majority of the time there is someone there to argue this logic. It's almost always when referring to the woman being the cheater. Nobody defends a male cheater. They start saying things like ""what if she wasn't happy in her previous relationship but then found the true one?!"" or ""What if he was abusive?"" and the golden vague statement of ""You don't know their situation. Everyone is different.""

My answer is always the same. Sure there are those who have made it work. There are those people who have cheated with someone and ended up being blissfully happy for eternity. They are the exception to the rule and not the metric that defeats it. Cheating isn't only an act but a steady progression of acts. It's a conscious decision to avoid issues within your own current relationship and handling them appropriately. By seeking outside attention that you should be seeking from your current SO. It's the understanding that the very act of cheating is an emotional blow to the one being cheated on but not having the respect for their feelings. 

It shows issues with conflict resolution, communication, and so much more. It's an issue if she cannot handle her uncomfortable situations in life and come to a proper resolution as an adult. It's just irresponsibility. Also it shows a horrible example of what she does when trouble arises in the relationship or some new charming guy comes along. Does she run to that guy friend who seems to be on the bench waiting to be called up? When she is out with the girls or on a business trip somewhere what happens when that good looking and charming guy hits on her at the bar? Does her casual feelings about cheating and her already proven ability to ignore her partners feelings result in a hotel room romp? After all, cheating seems to be easy for her. As long as you won't find out no harm no foul right?

I can go on for ages.  "

We went out for coffee, then took a walk. Overall our first date was like 5 hours of just talking constantly. She had so much to say, and we both had the exact same sense of humour. I was smitten, honestly. We hugged but, being sober and in public, that's all.

The day after *she* was pushing to meet again soon. We texted constantly for a week then met up for an afternoon pub crawl to show her around town (she was pretty new). It went just as well as the first, and by this point I was getting worried. I wasn't really looking to get serious with anyone but now I had no choice because *damn*. She was funny, sarky, very smart, ambitious, very self-aware, and really bloody pretty. I had friends staying with me for the weekend so I couldn't invite her in. We kissed, then went our separate ways.

Next weekend was my birthday weekend so we met up on the Sunday. She organised this one. We met in our usual spot, and abused some Mormons who wouldn't leave us alone. Then she lead me to a cool secret park to watch the sunset, and drink wine. At this point she revealed she'd actually baked me god damned birthday cupcakes. I was getting waaaaay too far ahead of myself for a third date. In my head I was basically planning out what our kids would be called. In my defense, she seemed every bit as keen.

It was cold and I didn't wear a jacket so we headed back to her flat. We ended up sitting in the living room with her flatmate doing shots and talking nonsense until about 1am when her flatmate went to bed. We talked a bit more before we began making out. We alternated between talking and making out until dawn and it was just... incredibly intimate, even though deals weren't sealed. She kicked me out, which was fair enough.

Next week, plans to meet but she said she was ill. We texted quite a bit, and she still seemed very much into this. We made plans for the weekend after. She was in the middle of exams so it was just a quick coffee. It went fine, things still seemed great.

Then she just disappeared. No text, no indication, no nothing.

After finding out at the senior breakfast, I looked all over for him trying to confront him, but he had already left. The next day i brought back everything she had given me, and we had just gone on a disneyland trip a couple months prior, and we got each other Duffy Bears, its essentially a bear that Minnie made Mickey when he went into the Navy, something like that, we had matching Mickey and Minnie shirts, and she got me a ""story of Duffy bear"" book, and she altered the speech bubbles by making them relevant to us, anyways, when i returned everything it was altered....  i wrote book of lies all over the duffy book, ripped up my shirt and wrote fuck you and cunt all over it, and the duffy bear with his eyes ripped out and head halfway ripped off.

That if I saw someone left out, to invite them, or someone without a lunch, to share even if it meant I would be starving by the time I got home.

2)I'm out with friends.  I don't do well flirting in front of my friends, I just feel weird.  I've had girls approach me in bars while out in my group, and I just kind of ignore them/never really flirt back.

the one I said yes to was a friend of a friend.  She was so insanely attractive.  Tall, blonde, track athlete.  I honestly wish I could have met her later in life so we were more sexually compatible.  I was still nervous about sex (only had slept with one girl, an ex-GF who was really catholic... yeah missionary position).  Damn, the things I would do to that blondie today :/  There is no way she enjoyed most of the sex we had, but she would still booty call me all the time."

However, I really want to stress that if she were an otherwise normal girl, I would not see what was wrong with her wanting to rub your jizz all over her, and there's definitely nothing wrong with a girl running to the bathroom immediately after sex. Few people want cold, goopy spunk sitting in their belly button or sliding slowly down their sides and onto the sheets. Even more important, few people want a giant UTI in the morning. It's important to pee after sex. For women who are prone to UTIs, they may be so paranoid that they jump up and run to the bathroom to pee IMMEDIATELY afterward. I do."

Finding that kind of shit out will make anyone think ""what's wrong with me that they don't want to explore sex with *me*?!"" and that may turn to ""those desires just didn't go away, so either I'm so repulsive that she can't have fun sex with me, or she's having fun sex with someone else"" and thus kill that relationship. 

So, if you're sexually adventurous, then find someone else who is sexually adventurous and have lots of babies in a very freaky way. (Or don't have babies and just have freaky sex.)"

As for what makes her the love of my life... not only is she beautiful, a great mother, and someone I can depend on to make good choices with money and in other life matters, but she's easy to live with. 

Perhaps for some of the younger guys reading this that won't mean much... but when you pair up with someone for the rest of your life, if they are, in any way, difficult to live with... it wears you down. Your spouse is supposed to be someone who provides a refuge from the stress and grind of your job, the grind of real life, etc.

If you come home every day after work and instead of finding a respite from the harshness of the world you simply exchange one source of stress for another source of stress, it'll slowly kill you (or, over the years, you'll wish that it would). 

You don't want a wife that is hard to live with. You don't want a wife that nags you, argues with you, fights with you over money or big issues like familial relationships or having children, etc. 

Life is hard enough without having the one person you should be able to trust above all, at odds with your happiness."

449,"Together about 13 years, married for nearly 10.

I'm not so oblivious that I think that the woman is perfect, and I have no doubt that other people could pick out flaws in her.  As sappy as it sounds, I honestly can't think of any part of her looks or character that I'd call a flaw.  That's not to say that she could do no wrong, but the things that would be deal breakers are so far outside of her character it just isn't something I spend time thinking about.

Maybe I'm an outlier here and I just got very, very lucky, but for me it's not about coming to terms with her imperfections, but that I love the woman so much that whatever flaws she has are irrelevant to me.  She's not perfect, but she's perfect for me.  

Jesus crap that sounds fucking lame.  She drives into shit a little more often than I'd like.  Does that count?"
450,"In general, I used to be concerned about surface things like how similar our music tastes were and what foods we both liked. I think it was because I never dated anyone long enough to get past those things mattering.

Now I couldn't really care less what someone thinks about tomatoes on a salad. If I were to date again, I'd be much more concerned about the how kind she is, how she solves conflict, how she takes criticism, etc. 

I'd also be wary of someone who was a prude in bed. If doggy style is too kinky for you, we're probably not a good match."

I won't go into full detail on it, but the EMTs were absolutely amazing and did everything in their power for her. She didn't make it, but they worked their asses off to give her the best chance.

I never got a chance to properly thank them, so I'll thank you right now for all you did during that time."
463,"Let's say she's in medical school. She's going to spend a ridiculous amount of time studying, doing rounds, etc. over a four year period. Little time for anything else.

At the end of her four years, she'll go through a matching process to get into residency programs. Aside from choosing which programs to apply to, she has little control over where she ends up. Say she wants to go to a prestigious residency program that's out of state and she has a good shot at getting in, is she going to apply to only local programs instead for the sake of the relationship? Am I really going to move when I have my own ambitions? 

Then there's the actual residency program. She'll spend 60-80 hours a week working (getting up very early in the morning) but since she's still a student, she'll be studying after work too. Because she'll have exams that she has to take.

Then after residency, she might want to do a fellowship. Again, where the hell is she going to end up? 

Probably the biggest problem with becoming a doctor is that she's going to spend so much time focused on medicine that she's not going to be able to hold a conversation on anything else. You won't just hear about what goes on in the hospital, she'll try to explain some of the more technical details too. Which is incredibly boring."
464,"I took a gap year to travel abroad for seven months. It even got in my local newspaper, and it was overall some of the best times I've had so far.

I tell people that I just really wanted to travel and see the world before getting bogged down by student debt, but really I was trying to find a place away from home to kill myself far from everyone else I knew, because it would potentially hurt them less if I was an ocean or two away.

On Christmas Eve, I remember walking through the midnight streets of a Cologne suburb. I went down to a small stream in a park and followed it into the woods. The whole time, I was thinking about how best to kill myself and if I should even do it. I was pretty sure that this would be my final night on this earth.

I kept walking for a few hours until about 4 in the morning, intermittently sobbing or sitting next to an electrical pole. I saw nobody, and nobody saw me.

The only reason I'm still not dead is because I consciously chose to just ride out the rest of life until the good times end, and see what happens after that, but I couldn't really give too much of a reason. It was just something my brain decided not to do. So I lived.

I don't really know what's gonna happen after the good times."
465,"You're going to fight so you're going to need to learn how to fight better. 

When you disagree communication tends to break down. That's the time to take a break. 


While you're calming down think about what your spouse was trying to say, and try to empathize with them. 


When you reconvene speak with the intention of making your spouse feel heard. If you don't lead with empathy you will go right back into fighting again. Hold your spouse accountable for making your feel heard. It doesn't come naturally to most people so you'll probably have to walk them through it at first.

If it's a big problem the two of you can get back to working on it as a team once you both feel heard. Compromise and follow through with action on what you two decide.

If it's a small problem you can both drop it so it doesn't ruin the rest of the day."

I tried calling him, texted twice. I just wanted to know why. He lived 45 minutes away and I had no car. So, I got my mom to take me. I waited outside his house for an hour on the porch. He came home from school and almost drove away when he saw me.

I brought his pillow and some of his other things as a ""reason"" to come over. His mom came in and made things awkward. Basically, whisper yelling ""why is she here?"" We talked for 2 hours. He said he never wanted to be with me EVER again. That I should move on, because he wants to be with other girls and I should be with other guys. I went home crushed, but relieved to have some sense of closure. 

I ""moved on"" a week later. Started dating a guy. Within a week of me dating this other guy with the same exact first name as him, he was begging for me to come back, he missed me, he loved me, ect. (First time he said he loved me.) 

Needless to say, I totally went back.

This led to low-quality work while everyone was trying to survive by hitting those numbers, which led to problems down the line for someone who didn't do the low quality work, but now has to take the hit on numbers and potentially face punishment/firing. 

""Managers"" would never give any positive feedback, only negative and often uncaring. So, if we said something like ""trying my best, but it's hard because this machine is shit/there's no room to stow items/there's too many broken products taking my time"" they simply blamed us (the individual being talked to) for it.

Everyone was hired via a temp agency, so could be let go at any time, often without warning.

There were 'problem solvers' who would help you if you had a malfunction/damaged item, etc. But there would only be one available for a floor of 20-30 people. So, they constantly had a queue, plus their own tasks to fulfill simultaneously. 

Crazy overtime rules where we were told halfway through the 10-hour shift that we would have overtime the next day for X hours and if we called-in we would be punished. This put people with other jobs, families, or obligations out because the overtime was certainly random.

That and when complaints were voiced for things that would help us do our jobs better (via process, available supplies, etc), they fell upon deaf ears or were implemented half-assedly. 

We had to be on our feet for 10-12 hours on a concrete floor, and only had two 15-minute breaks where part of our break time was used walking to the other side of the warehouse to the break rooms. 

Lunch was 30 minutes and the lunchroom was usually on the opposite end of the warehouse from where we worked, so about 10-12 minutes was spent just walking there and back because the warehouses themselves were simply ginormous. 

The pay was higher than most other businesses in the area, and we got an insurance package, but it wasn't worth the treatment/conditions.

I've heard that other warehouses have similar systems/conditions, but aren't cranked up to 11 like Amazon is. "
474,It work fine. Her boobs are always in my face when we hug.
475,She loves you both did you ask for a threesome
476,"Then why the ""no regrets""?"
477,Families are a huge tell for how a girlfriend will act. I always try to meet the family before getting serious with anyone. 
478,"She's long distance and wants a break? That usually means she wants the freedom to pursue someone else who is there, but keep you as a fallback option if things don't work out.

Just go and pursue other women. Accept that this one is gone. Keep yourself busy. Go out with your male friends."
479,"&gt; Later than night I found out he was the manager that hired my step-dad promising a full time job.

My Jaw hit the fucking floor. "
480,"I'm studying to be a nurse right now. I've got my last exams of the semester tomorrow and the following Tuesday. It's hard. Hardest thing I've done so far. Doing something so hard puts so many doubts into my mind with this career choice.

But reading stuff like this... damn, this is what I'm fighting for. If I can just make one difference in one person's life half as big as your tale then it will all be worth it.

I don't know what else to say, just... thanks for sharing. I'm glad she made it."
481,"Oh, we do. It's just that what men consider to be an average or unattractive woman is different from what women consider to be an average or unattractive woman. "
482,You might want to bring her to a doctor about that.  Mostly because she might forget why she's there. 
483,Would *you* date a guy like that?
484,"&gt; father-in-law, uncle, wife, and mother in the same year

That's honestly the makings of a bad decade; to endure all that in a year? Holy crap, I'm sorry. 

I don't know what I'd do if I lost my wife. I just don't know. Only thing worse I can think of is losing my daughter. "
485,"I totally understand the concern over feeling objectified, but then what about the feeling that you're not even worth that much, that you're not good enough to even be objectified? That's a pretty low bar."
486,"I used to work at a small advertising agency in Minneapolis. Great place, we were a little family, the underdog that bit off big clients and did great work. The President of the agency was a really nice guy, a former priest, a foodie, and a man of the people. 

Well, one day someone comes up with the idea of lunch club and we start doing it. Eight people sign up, and one day per week, for eight weeks, we take turns bringing in a main course and one side for people. Some winning entries were Phaux Pho, Grilled Cheese Bar, Ropa Vieja ... great stuff. It became very popular and we did seven rounds of it before I departed the company.

One day the president is rolling through at lunch and sees us all down there. Being a foodie, he perks up and is like all interested. So we invite him to the next one. I forget that it's his day, until I stroll into the kitchen / bar area and smell the cooking. Being a filthy rich guy and a consummate food and wine guy, we were all looking forward to his contribution. So I come rolling in, and I'm like, ""MMM MMM what's cookin? Smells great!"" to which he says, ""Oh it's mushroom bisque with caviar on top."" 

Mushrooms and caviar. My two least favorite foods ever. Ever. But he's ladling up a bowl and everyone else is slurping soup and I felt like all eyes were on me to accept the proffered bowl of food. I froze.

Then I lied. 

""Oh that smells really great but I can't. I have a mushroom allergy.""

(*Internal monologue: DIPSHIT!! Can you even have that? Is that a real thing? Do they know you're bullshitting? You better google it quick if you make it out of this alive!*)

So the President retracts the bowl and then goes on to over apologize and make the biggest deal of it. I'm like, ""No no, it's not a big deal!! I'll just go next door and get a sandwich, no big deal please! haha!"" but everyone is making a fuss and it was terrible. 

About an hour later, the person whose turn was next week sent an email asking if anyone was allergic to shellfish, and it was decided that an allergen policy was best. So now it became a thing to ask everyone if they were allergic to the thing you were thinking of making. Sigh. 

To take it one further, the guy whose office was next to me, and our shared Creative Director, both knew I was full of shit. So whenever the president was around, mushroom allergy came up. Also, whenever we were just out having lunch or drinks with coworkers and friends, and ordering came up, so did The Mushroom Allergy. 

FURTHERMORE, when I left, and went to a new job, my Creative Director, being a clever jackass, *fucking sent my new boss a LinkedIn request, and they messaged about this, and it was transmitted to my new job.* People at my new job, who were never there, know the story. And give me shit for it.

To this day, it will come up. It's been years, and I never copped to it to the President.

It's a lie I will take to my grave, haha. "
487,"I grew up in a poor environment but I never even knew. I understood that money was tight and we weren't rich, but I never really got a full grasp of the situation. I didn't question any of it until I was a teen, but by then my dad hit it big so it didn't really matter.

Children don't need money to grow up happy. Just a caring family."
488,A cute face because at the end of the day im gonna be looking at her face way more than im gonna be looking at her ass or boobs.
489,"&gt;a few times

A few times. "
490,She's the Barefoot Contessa!
491,"They're not bad at judging women by their looks, they're good at lying to an unattractive friend about how hot she is. Gotta spare the feelings."
492,"My wife is a beautiful, educated woman who while at work is in charge of several people, and apparently does an amazing job leading them. 

But then she gets how and will literally ask me before doing anything. ""Should I have the kids put on their shoes? You think I should go work out? What should I have for lunch?"". Some questions she could answer herself if she thought for a moment. 

I once counted for a day and she asked me over 100 questions when I finally told her, and the day wasn't over. We have a 6 year old girl that doesn't do half that. 

I think it has to do with her culture, she comes from a conservative Muslim household, and maybe wanting to not have to make decisions while off work. We're working on it. But in the meantime, she is an amazing mother and wife. "
493,That is awesome hahah
494,"I get what you're saying, really I do, but I have a pug who's currently snoring on his back and I couldn't help but laugh as I read it."
495,"This. I actually prefer a girl who's thick, but ""fat"" is a clear distinction, and the difference is the stomach, mainly. I dated a fat girl for a long time, and while I loved her very much and still found her attractive, her insecurity about it was so strong that after 2 years I never actually saw her fully naked. I might have sex with a fat girl but I don't think I'll ever date one again because it tends to be a pretty big indicator of other mental issues, namely depression and lack of self-discipline. The correlation, in my experience, is just too strong to ignore."
496,"Pros: knowing a lot more about yourself than other people, not beeing involved in drama, just simplier life, with less worries most of the time


Cons: More likely to be in a sad mood, uncomfortable in social situations(especially if not with friends), lack of courage to meet new, different people"
497,Hell no. I deleted NSFW pictures of my ex a couple days after we broke up. 
498,"Yes,  I got a bad vibe and sensed that something wasn't right with her.
She ended up stalking me for a year and a half, until she found a guy that said yes to her."
499,"&gt; Waitstaff have made strange comments sometimes, such as ""How INTERESTING that you two are together..."".

""How INTERESTING that you're not getting a tip. ""

My first job was in a restaurant and I tip well and I probably wouldn't not tip someone unless they just sucked and had a bad attitude (happened only once in my life), but if I heard that, I couldn't not do something about it. "
500,Not awesome at all
501,Our music taste has almost zero overlap. But we have similar opinions and thoughts on the things that really matter.
502,Absolutely.
503,"That shit blew me away in elementary school. One kid told about his summer vacation trip and I was like ""your family goes away on vacation? Like on purpose.."""
504,"Yeah, but who actually has the personality of a Jack Black? The guy is world class when it comes to talent, humor and personality. "
505,"I have approached twice in my life. First time, guy wasn't interested. No problem. I walked back to my friends and had a great time. Second time, the guy was really attractive, but 5 minutes of conversation showed what a conceited jerk he was so I became disinterested and tried to leave. He flipped out. According to him, I had come up to him so I couldn't play games with him like that and walk away. I had opened a can of worms and now he felt entitled to my time, and, as was quickly obvious, my body. The bartender rescued me and threw him out, but it was terrifying. And thus I never approached a guy again."
506,"Cross-dressing fashion show, running race with tampons up your ass, etc.

Nothing too crazy, the point of it was just to bond with your pledge class."
507,Can you T-Bone a smart car? Seems more like dotting an i...
508,Lol
509,"Constant complaining about other people, zero accountability - always an excuse. Never bringing up issues face-to-face with that person, always instead gossiping to other people. Eventually I was the one she settled on complaining about"
510,"I find that if a girl is interested in me, I'm more likely to be interested in her... perhaps because not many girls are interested in me.  =/"
511,"There were a few mind fucks along the way but the initiation itself is what you would expect. A ceremony of sorts. I did promise never to talk about it and even though I don't give a shit anymore, I don't want to be the one asshole who spills a national organization's cool secrets. 

The mindfucks are more interesting anyways. Convincing you that you've been dropped from the pledge process and then ambushing you as you walk home. Convincing you to come and hang out then placing you an a pitch black room with crazy music and dudes bursting in drinking challenges every hour for hours. Convincing you of one final impossible test that someone has already failed and then just throwing you all a fun party.

Not super creative for interesting but I found it fun."
512,"When she says ""I have an IUD."""
513,[deleted]
514,I'm so tired of ugly people complaining about not wanting to date other ugly people. 
515,"She had just gotten out of a loooong ass relationship only 2-3 months prior, but she was THAT girl from middle school/high school that I never thought I'd have a chance with and she slid into my DMs after 4 years of not having talked.  

We had a stupidity intense relationship that lasted about two months before she realized ""oh wait, I don't wanna be in a relationship, so all that stuff I said about loving you? Yeah...no."" 

Looking back, it was blindly obvious, but there was no way I was passing that chance up lol.  Worth it.  "
516,"If I had been 10 minutes later getting home, this story might end in a tragedy. I look back on that day and realize how incredible it is that she survived. The planets truly aligned, and we got lucky.

&gt; If I can just make one difference in one person's life

Keep that in mind - not every story you come across as a healthcare provider will have a happy ending. Some will break you down and leave you scrubbing the last remains of someone else's life up off the floor, proverbially and literally. 

But ... there will be those times when you're someone's hero. My brother James (God rest him) was fond of saying, ""*You are only promised three things in this world: You were born; You will die; You will have the chance to do the right thing*"". Sounds like you're preparing to do the right thing when the time comes."
517,"For your #3, since it probably isn't the healthiest interest, have you tried shifting focus instead of eliminating your attraction altogether?  So instead of going for a woman who gets into random brawls, focus on women who are into martial arts or who practice kickboxing at the gym.  They should still have that same 'feel' to them without all the associated negativity."
518,Jesus Christ. How the hell can someone beat a *four month old*?
519,I got back together with her.  Repeatedly.  Wasn't a great move.
520,Having dated a doctor and having been friends with other doctors I can tell you you are way off. Some of the coolest and most interesting people I have known. 
521,"All that sweet sweet gaming time tho! 

OP will most likely have an okay time with this coworker. 


**OR**


An awesome time playing some vidya! Weekends only come around like once every 5 days or so. Time is precious and must not be wasted! "
522,"&gt;kind of misses the point cause by then you'll be exhausted again.

Yeah, employers don't give a flying fuck if you're exhausted or not. Anything having to do with workers rights is against company interests as far as a lot of menial jobs are concerned. Some companies are better than others, but you'd get fired on the spot at a Wal-Mart if you so much as mention this around the wrong manager or coworker."
523,Fuck work weeks like that. There needs to be a work life balance. My old job had me working 6 days but absolutely NO overtime under any circumstance. So I had a 40 hour week but only 1 day off. So after more than a month of being lied to that they were looking for more people I finally said fuck them and left
524,"Ok. I'm female and I have to admit that my dumb 18 year old brain did stuff like this to me. I'm 31 now and I cringe looking back. This might not be what she's doing but the point is that age is complicated. 

My first year of college I was shy, insecure and didn't have any friends beyond my roommates. Met a guy. We hung out a lot. We fooled around but I didn't want a relationship with him. He was also a little awkward and his insatiable appetite for Aqua Teen Hunger Force, when it was more hit or miss for me, got on my nerves. 

I see all these movies and shows talking about friends with benefits and how *easy* it is. I read shitty magazines marketed to me so I don't realize how shitty they are. I am a strong independent soon-to-be educated woman who can sleep around ""just like the boys"" completely unattached. So I stupidly establish this FWB rule having not enough experience to understand that sex or things of a sexual nature complicates things and my immature and inexperienced 18 year old brain might not be able to deal. 

Remember, I'm shy, insecure and friendless. Never had much attention from guys and I'm struggling to find a support system away from my family. I like having someone to rely on when I'm feeling lonely. He does too. So we talk on the phone at night and blah blah blah...we are basically a couple. But not. Because I said so. 

So FWB. He's like ""ok that's fine."" But let down. THEN he sees another girl. She's in to him. And I'm like ""oh god did I miss something? Is he *actually* boyfriend material? If *she* likes him so much then maybe he is actually amazing. If they start dating he won't need me anymore. But I still need him! Fuck. I'm jealous."" 

Suddenly Aqua Teen Hunger Force seems not so bad. "
525,Mom died when I was 1.5 years old.  I don't remember anything about her.  
526,"This is very accurate.

Source: Am boring. Family is very boring."
527,"Have you considered the possibility that she thinks you left it out on purpose to brag to her how wealthy you are and now she's posting on AW about her date who ""accidentally"" left out a bank receipt?

No need for panic.  Quit worrying about it and just relax!"
528,"I don't spend two hours at the gym every night, nor do I necessarily cook every night. I also stay up later and wake up earlier than you."
529,"Underated logic joke.   

A pregnant logician is riding the subway. 
""Is it a boy or a girl?"" asks an onlooking woman.   

""Yes,"" said the logician"
