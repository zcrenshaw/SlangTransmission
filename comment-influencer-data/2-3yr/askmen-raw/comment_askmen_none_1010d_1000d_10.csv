0,"Hey guys who piss all over the floor instead of in the urinal itself (at work, where you are not drunk), what's the deal? "
1,"""You'll find someone when you stop looking""

Too vague, and too easily misunderstood as giving up on dating, etc. What it really means is stop being so obsessed with getting in a relationship because that desperation is overshadowing your real personality. "
2,"Don't stop dating.

Have date days where both of you go out together and do things like you did before."
3,"""Don't go to bed angry.""

Absolutely go to bed angry. It's the best thing you can do. You won't solve anything till you've calmed down, and in the morning, you will be able to see how silly your fight really was."
4,"I'd masturbate. Then I'd have a threesome.

I would also probably enjoy turning down a lot of men after having them buying me drinks, that seems like a fun thing to do isn't it Paula you fucking bitch. 
"
5,"""Pick a career you're passionate about, and money won't be a problem.""

Just because you're passionate about something when you're 18, doesn't mean you will be for the rest of your life, or that doing it professionally won't kill your passion for it. It also doesn't mean you're skilled or talented enough to find a job in it, or that such a job would pay for a comfortable living."
6,Not even pick up her phone. 
7,"I once had a girl over at mine. I kissed her goodbye and went inside. 

She got to the end of my driveway, then came running back inside to kiss me again. 


Genuine 11/10 moment in my life. 
"
8,"Look back just before disappearing from view at the end. Like, lets say you are getting into a cab. Just before you close the door, you stand up again, look over the door for one last glance, then get in and ride away. "
9,"Your wife will react to things in ways that don't make sense to you.  She'll think something is really important when it isn't.  She'll be really upset over something trivial.

Recognize that this isn't a 'Woman Thing'.  It's a 'People thing'.  You are doing the same thing to her as well.  And that's okay.

Learn to understand the difference between times where you should try to comfort her by discussing how little something really is (this is rare by the way) and when to recognize that it's just that it is trivial *to you*.  

I'm not saying that you need to make these things important to you... you don't have to care about the event... but you should care that she cares instead of ""fixing the problem"" of her caring about something trivial.  

Recognize that it is important to her and work with that in mind.  "
10,"I'm drunk at work, duh"
11,"Hakuna Prostata

What a wonderful phrase

12,"Important clarification: *Do* stop dating *other people*. Don't stop dating your spouse. (I read it wrong the first time and was like ""Whaaaa."")"
13,"Broke up with my girlfriend who was crazy about me because it was her dream to go to school across the country, in hawaii. Broke her heart. Broke mine. She has a new boyfriend and is happy while I hate myself and want to die."
14,Self respect.
15,"Hey guys who stumble into bathroom heaving and gasping for air to take a piss like you just ran a fucking marathon, what's the deal with that too?"
16,No fat chicks.
17,"""You shouldn't care about what other people think of you.""

Of course you should care about what other people think of you.  Caring what other people think about you is the cornerstone of social cohesiveness.  It's the absolute foundation of compassion, consideration, manners and etiquette.  

Now get the fuck off my lawn."
18,Pick your fights. Very few things are worth arguing over.  But also know when to say No.
19,Might be Prostata problems.
20,"I have Crohn's disease and am missing a lot of parts. I also need to use the bathroom suddenly and urgently at any time.

I have sex almost every night. I am married to an awesome woman who sees me as the man she loves, not the guy with a disability. "
21,"Don't keep score.

There will always be times where one person thinks the other isn't doing enough to help out around the house / with the kids / whatever.  Every time we've had conversations about it we both realized the other person was doing a lot more than we thought."
22,"Find one that isn't soul-crushing.

You don't have to find a job you love.  Honestly that's pretty unrealistic anyway.  But if your job is that bad, it's time to find something else."
23,"*In Soviet Russia, vegetable eats you!*"
24,A relationship like that would become a real pain in the ass.
25,Be interested in what I'm saying. Kissing me. I'm a simple man
26,They just ran a fucking marathon to take a piss.
27,I didn't date a girl who liked me cuz her I didn't like her name...
28,"Do what you say and say what you do. 

Don't caught up in lies. Even the smallest ones can/will break Trust eventually. Always and I mean ALWAYS be honest and truthful with her and she with you. 

Kiss her good morning, hello, goodbye and goodnight as if you may never see her again. Oh...and grab her ass while you do it. Just a squeeze should do. Make it known that she still does it for you. 

Wine &amp; dine her AT LEAST once per month or so. Life doesn't end when you're married and she should always feel like you're still very into her (and you should be, so don't fake it). Date night is my favorite because we get to spend time alone just my best friend and I. 

Surprise her with little things. Home one day? Do the dishes &amp; laundry (on top of yard work if you've got that to do). 

Don't ever treat her as though what she says, does or feels is less important than what you do, say, feel, etc. 

Remember: she's your wife and that makes her special.

29,"Keep your full body pics public and leave it at that.

If you don't want to draw attention to it, then simply don't.

Don't go into paragraphs talking about all the shit you do to make yourself not feel fat, because at your size, we're not believing it.

If you don't care, don't talk about it.  

Anyone interested has eyes, no need to try and weave some wordcraft, it just draws more attention."
30,"""Relationships are a lot of hard work.""

Don't get me wrong; in some ways they definitely are. But I've heard a lot of people use this to justify what are clearly bad relationships. Good relationships, on the whole, feel pretty damn easy most of the time. "
31,"This is something I have noticed with lots of my friends and mostly my housemate... the ability to clean up after yourself and cook yourself a proper meal. 
I never understood why all my exes were shocked when theyd see me clean up/do dishes/cook/wash/iron/keep the house clean etc, i get it now.
Shout outs to my mum for making me do all my own shit when I turned 15 though."
32,Take my clothes off and play with my boobs.
33,"""Just tell her how you really feel about her""

This isn't that terrible but it normally leads to some guy confessing his love for a girl who he's friends with. Expressing interest is fine but don't go all in with the ""I love you and we should be together."" 

And if she is happy and in a relationship you should probably move on."
34,"Growing up poor, I watched my mother do menial things in order to survive. To this day, I remain sensitive to this and am aware when someone is powering through such a task, or when they resent having to do it. Later in life, I got a career in advertising and witnessed an ultimate smackdown by the Group Creative Director. For anyone unfamiliar with agency life, this is the ultra boss. The boss of all the creative people, in an environment where creative is king. This person is THE BOSS. 

Anyway.

Before I was the boss, I was a senior level employee working with a really great GCD. Super guy. I shared a corner office affectionately referred to as a ""playpen"" with two other designers, one of whom was a bit of a hot girl living in an entitlement bubble. She's complaining about having to do a banner ad — we all hate them, yes — and as the Group Creative Director is walking by, he hears her whining something like, ""I didn't incur SCAD debt so I could schlep banner ads!"" 

And he does one of those snappy ""about face"" maneuvers and comes into our office. He just starts chatting like, no big deal, hey how you guys doing? Whatcha working on? He engages in casual conversation and is seemingly just shooting the shit with us. The intern sounds a little crestfallen when she tells him she is working on ad banners. Then he's like, 

""No worries, I'll do it.""

The blank look of incomprehension on her face was priceless. Her mind flatlined. What? The big boss ... is going to take over my ad banner?

Yep. And that's what he did. He took her off the project and assigned himself. He lowered his bill rate to hers for the client. He attended meetings and let the less senior creative director work with him on the ad banner and copy. 

We all learned a valuable lesson. 

I eventually became good friends with him and went on to being a boss myself. I still dabble in my subject matter to stay sharp, I don't just sit around and boss all day. When things get busy, I start working like the team, too. 

Good guy, I miss working with him.

Nothing is beneath you."

43,Yo America.  You know Europe isn't just one big country right? It's lots of little ones that are completely different. 
44,"This.  Can not stress this enough.  Too many people I know treat marriage as ""winning the race"" and then stop training, take off the uniform, relax and ""be themselves"", which means they didn't marry you, they married the illusion you were presenting.  Be yourself while dating and continue doing so when you're married.  Every day is a chance to make her smile and support her.

Additionally, manage your stress.  She has as much stress as you do, so if you come home and dump your stress on her, now she has hers AND yours and no place to put it, so it's coming back at you, and it just goes downhill from there.  Ignore your respective income levels and treat each other with the respect of equals."
45,I think you should see a therapist.
46,"We just compromise. My wife is quite extroverted. So for her, she would like to spend a weekend driving across the state visiting every single person she knows and accepting any and all social invitations.

[If Only... Gender Differences in Sexual Regret
](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201306/if-only-gender-differences-in-sexual-regret)

Excerpt:

&gt;A partner’s physical attractiveness is commonly thought of as a male preoccupation, but apparently when it comes to casual sex, women tend to raise the attractiveness bar for agreement (**""I’ll have a one night stand with someone, but only if he looks like George Clooney""**) 

&gt;while men tend to lower it: (**""It’s just a one-nighter, who cares if she looks like George Clooney""**).

Had to bold those quotes for hilariousness and capturing the ideas well."

Making this bigger for people to understand."
61,Lasting long enough. I try to pace myself but sometimes stuff doesn't go as planned.
62,"I had a friend who developed feelings for me, I just didn't feel the same way. She was emotionally unstable at this stage, and a lot of the time we were together she'd hang on my word or react in really extreme ways to things I did or said. Things I'd take as mild banter, she'd take as really deep insults, mild compliments would be taken extremely positively. I felt like I was on eggshells when I was hanging with her, I struggled to make boundaries clear and that was my mistake.

Being a fucking dumbass, and a few drinks down, I fooled around with her at a party. The aftermath didn't end well, and truth be told, I was a fucking asshole and I should have been more considerate of my friend. She was really really hurt by how I acted.

We stopped hanging out or really interacting regularly for a long time, she started taking meds, dated a few people, had a decent relationship, had another one, etc. I became a lot more emotionally intelligent, have a good relationship. We still hang around in the same social circles and over time we've become like friends again, both of us have changed for the better in the intervening time-  she's doing really well for herself. 

To be honest, my feelings towards her are a mixture of guilt at how I acted, and admiration for how she's clearly become a well-rounded person who's dealt with the issues she's had. "
63,A woman I'm not in love with is having my baby. 
64,"I'm even worse than just that. I'll fuck a slightly chubby chick, but wouldn't ever date one. "
65,If you have kids let them get dirty etc. While disgusting it will strengthen their immune system.
66,"It felt like shit. Watching theonly person that you have ever loved turn into a suicidal blob is not a good feeling. 

She's doing better now. Just ran a marathon I hear."
67,I'd drink it so I can be honest with myself
68,I have a quadriplegic buddy that gets laid all the time. Chicks have a fetish and he gets boners every time they stand him up in his walking machine. Says he knows he orgasmed when he gets a crazy headache. Dude loves to eat pussy. 
69,"Yeah, when we were dating. I can probably pinpoint it to one time when we drove a few hours away to visit friends. I told her before the weekend ""I want to be home by 6 on Sunday so I have time to wind down.""

Well on Sunday we visited her friends and sat there. Chatted, hung out, but I noticed it was approaching the time we would need to leave to arrive home by 6. I kept saying ""hey maybe we should leave soon..."" and I'd get brushed off.

Finally it was about 6 and we finally left. Then one of her friends called and wanted to go out to dinner and she asked me while the friend was on the phone, so I didn't want to be the bad guy and shut it down. So we ended up getting home at like midnight. 

The next day I told her I felt completely disregarded and she apologized. From there we had a better understanding. "
70,"The whole ""Breastaurant"" concept. (Hooters, Twin Peaks, Tilted Kilt, Bikinis, etc.)

It's all the sleazy, empty pandering and inflated prices of a strip club, with none of the partial (or in some states, full) nudity. What's more unsettling as due to the lack of nudity, these places are branded as ""family restaurants"" as well. 

No thanks."
71,"boi that's some cute as fuck romcom shit, why you gotta make me feel like that"
72,"Something I've had to learn being married is I have to be assertive about what I want and how I feel. There's a time and a place to compromise and make some degree of sacrifice, but if I don't express my wants/desires/feelings I'll become very bitter and unhappy down the road.  
  
This may not apply to a majority of men, and it almost certainly applies to some women, but nonetheless."
73,Most women have some standard for confidence and stoicism in their partners. It doesn't mean that you can't ever show weakness but I don't think most women like *weak men*.

Edit: you'd also be surprised how much can be accomplished by grunting and rudimentary hand gestures."
75,"*Thanks to Gmail and their wonderful search function, here is the exact text (modified to protect anonymity) of my response to a $90,000 offer that resulted in an increase to $105,000 (this was about a decade ago, so things may be different now).*

Thank you for the offer letter and the additional information you provided to me regarding the Company's benefits package.  I continue to be excited about the opportunity to work with you and to help [the company] grow to its full potential.  As I mentioned in our last conversation, I truly believe that I am an ideal fit for [the company] in this role.  The position offers all the aspects I'm looking for from the day-to-day responsibility for financial reporting to the upper management roles of driving profitability, strategic management and business analysis.

Based upon the time I have spent with you, I believe that the keys to success for [the company] are to analyze and accurately project future cash flow, while also identifying and analyzing the costs of each specific job order.  With accurate information about both cash needs and project profitability, as a management team we will be able to make business decisions in the best interest of the Company and its investors.  This is very similar to the situation I was faced with when I joined [my previous employer] 5 years ago.  By providing accurate financial information on a product and customer basis, we were able to make proper business decisions which led that company to strong profitability after a decade of losses.  Based upon that experience, I believe I can duplicate that success at [the company].

However, the salary and benefits package provided for in the offer letter were significantly lower than what I was anticipating and desiring and I do not feel it reflects this value that I would bring to the Company.  As we discussed during the interview process, I am flexible with my salary requirements and do not necessarily need to replace the base salary of $113,000 that I was making in my previous position.  However, I was hoping to stay as close to that range as possible and anticipating a decrease closer to 5%, rather than the 20% represented by the $90,000 in the offer.  

To make certain that I wasn't being unreasonable with my expectations, I consulted the Salary Guide for Accounting and Finance Professionals published by Accounting Principles.  As you can see from the extract below, my expectations are significantly below the $129,000 average [position] salary for small companies.

[Salary Guide Extract with Markups.JPG]

I know, name, that this leaves us with a pretty big gap between the offer and what I'm looking for.  I don't know how much flexibility you have to increase the offer closer to the $107,000 - $110,000 range, but I believe that is a reasonable salary for the position and would adequately reflect my skills, experience and the value that I will bring to the Company.  I truly believe that adding me as an additional strong and experienced leader on your management team would lead to the financial success that you and the investors are looking for at [the company].

I wanted to respond in writing to give you an opportunity to fully absorb and contemplate the information provided.  Please let me know your thoughts and if you would like to discuss any possible alternatives in more detail, please call me.  I'd also be happy to meet with you again if you feel that would be more productive.

Best regards,

*A couple keys in this negotiation were that (a) the offer was coming from a company that I knew was struggling financially, so I wasn't sure they'd be able to afford my demands and (b) I had confidence that I could probably find a different job that paid more, and at worst could find another job that would pay me $90,000, if this one didn't work out.  So even if they had told me that $90,000 was the best they could do, I would have been fine with rejecting the offer and continuing my search.*"
76,"Letting out piss after holding it in for a very long time almost feels as good as an orgasm though. I'm not a grunter, but I understand it... "
77,"You guys will be fine considering that you're aware of this issue and are willing to accommodate his need.

My responsibility is to tell my wife when my 'batteries are getting low'. My wife's responsibility is to be considerate when she's making plans for the week/month. 

For example she won't schedule a group date with our friends the day after a family party. 

I get off work 2-3 hours before my wife gets home so I have that time to myself. I have Friday and Saturday off and my wife has Saturday and Sunday off. Friday is my day to recharge and spend time alone. Saturday is our day to enjoy each other. 


She usually spends Sunday with her family and she sees her friends once a week."
78,"23 year old man with achondroplastic dwarfism here (making me 4ft tall). My sex life is non-existent, but I wouldn't entirely blame that on my condition. I'm a very introverted person who also seems to have a pretty low sex drive, so I've gone through most of my adult life not thinking about sex that much. When I do, it's more worrying about what other people will think about me being a virgin still, not about wanting to have sex myself.

Another factor is that the only sexual interaction I've had with another person was both non-consensual and a very unpleasant experience for me. People have suggested that my lack of sexual interest is a defence mechanism from that experience, which is a possibility as well. Either way, I'm content with not having a sex life currently. I get on with other things, and I'm happy with that.

110,"I think people misinterpret this advise to mean that you need to ""finish"" this fight before going to sleep. What it really means to me is that if you're having a major altercation with your SO, then you need to at least come to some sort of resolve before going to sleep. Even if it's just an agreement to discuss it again in the morning or this weekend. If you don't do that, and just go to sleep without resolving anything, then you wake up in the morning and *kinda* forget about it.

That might seem just fine at first, but if you keep doing it, it just builds up. Everyday busy life takes over, and you never end up ever dealing with these issues. Eventually they build up a ton or resentment between a couple because nothing that they argue about ever comes to any sort of resolution.

Most of the time when people get divorced it isn't because someone was cheating or someone was abusive. If you ask a lot of divorced people they will say something along the lines of ""it wasn't any big thing, just a lot of little things that added up over time"". Ever wonder what those little things were? A lot of the time, the people in the relationship can't exactly put their finger on it. That's because they did exactly this. They had a fight, left it open ended, and kinda forgot about it. The specific fight or issue might fade. But the resentment for your partner lingers.

Obviously, there is no way that all the fights a couple has will be resolved in the time to take to go to bed. But at the very least you should try to get on the same page about how you're going to approach the issue going forward. If you don't at least do that, you *will* end up ignoring these issues in the short term, and it *will* cause longer term problems. "

Even in social gatherings now with friends or out on the town, that blue-white hue surrounding people's faces bothers me. I'm a hypocrite though, I do it too. It's not that using your phone is a bad thing, it's just that we are all so caught up in projecting our perceived best selves on the internet with social media that we forget sometimes the real interactions are more important.

118,"I'm in my mid-20's and have always been pretty nerdy.  I'm huge into video games, used to own a bunch of Star Wars novels, played MTG and had multiple decks through high school and part of college.  But I work with a lot of other men who are all mostly ""guy's guys"" macho kind of dudes that all watch sports and talk about it a lot.  I tend to just throw myself into work when the sports chatter starts.  I don't feel the need to participate in the talk because I don't care.  

As for the masculinity thing...it used to make me feel pretty iffy about my own masculinity.  But then one day I was sitting in the breakroom and eating the tacos my boss had bought us for breakfast while he was chatting with my coworker about their fantasy league.  For some reason I was actually listening to it but as they talked more and more about their players' stats, injuries, and busting out all these terms I had never even heard before for this ""fantasy"" thing I realized something: 

Those guys are fucking *nerds.*  The ones that are really into it (especially the fantasy league people) talk about their fantasy football in the *exact* same way my buddies would talk about their *Magic: the Gathering* decks.   Hearing my boss talk about the pros and cons of taking Player A over Player B sounded just like me talking about increased survivability vs extra DPS in an RPG.  

My point is this: everybody is kind of a nerd about something.  Sports guys are just nerds about sports. "

121,"I feel like most redditors just misunderstand what ""being yourself"" means. It doesn't mean that you drop all situational awareness and let your urges dictate your behavior. It instead means to be comfortable with yourself. That you should stop being so self conscious and not worry so much at how others might think of you. You shouldn't be afraid to express your feelings, and doing so is important for social interaction. If someone else is unable to anticipate your mood and reactions, then you will make them feel uncomfortable and consequently they'll think you are a weirdo."
122,"Tip:

Try having her behind you, giving you a shoulder/neck massage while you masturbate. That way there's not as much pressure than if she were just lying or sitting right in front of you.

Take your time and just enjoy her presence and her touch. She can play around with kissing your neck, nibbling your ears, and talking dirty about what you're doing, what she wants to do to you, and about what *you* want to do to her.

She can even do a reach around and stroke you occasionally, and you'll still be able to passionately kiss each other, etc. Try this until you can build up to just you masturbating by yourself with her simply watching and participating less and less, if that's her true fantasy."

Full of darkness and danger they were,

How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened?

Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.


Those were the stories that stayed with you.
That meant something.

For example, my husband thinks it's super irrational that I get anxious and upset if he's late coming home from work (and it is!). But for the most part I can't help it--if he's not home within half an hour of the standard time I assume he's dead. So even though he thinks it's dumb that I get so worried and that he shouldn't have to step away for 30 seconds to shoot me a text letting me know he's running late, he still does it because he doesn't want me to be sad and scared.

He cares about *me*, and that's what's important."

Twice we ended up having threesomes with friends of hers, one who had a crush on her and another that I found out she'd fooled around with prior to us getting together. The one with the crush on her it ended up a mess because the girl got obsessed with the idea and kept showing up at our place asking for another, we obliged a few times but when she started referring to it as a ""tri-relationship"" and wanted us to share her we cut her off. The other girl it was not an issue.

Or you develop a back problem and don't want to go out as much, but your thing had been going out. Or one of you develops acid reflux and you can't eat pizza as much. Or a couple you are close to splits up for reasons that, at first glance, seem eerily similar to problems you have. Her best friend gets pregnant by some jerk who she should have dumped and she spends more time with her for a year. 

All kinds of things change relationships. And one of the BEST ones is that you grow closer and more comfortable with each other. You develop more and more tricks and strategies that help you guys be an awesome team. But, this means you may not fight as much about something you used to, or you navigate social situations smoother. You'll never see it in the moment, only realize it later. It changes because you change. And your partner changes. You look back and compare it to an earlier time and realize it is different. And that is okay.

When it comes to benefits/bonuses it largely depends on the company if they even negotiate those. Most rigid corporate structures, and especially large nonprofits tend to have a set benefits plan including PTO and it's usually non-negotiable. If any part of the offer is non-negotiable, HR will usually tell you up front if you bring it up. "

And, after the date/in the end of it, show that you want to do it again. There's nothing more amazing (at least for me) then a woman who's confident enough to show that she liked you and it's eager to go after you.

Anyway I'm mostly commenting to say that my city has a pet bylaw about this that basically states that if you allow your dog to defecate on someone else's property it MUST be cleaned up right away. There's a hefty fine attached to it if it goes that far. I would imagine that other city's have something similar so if the problem keeps persisting after trying to deal with it directly, you may have options. "

243,"Dearest, my greatest concern is that you may have many other issues worth addressing if you are uncomfortable discussing sex with a medical provider. You're correct to abstain from sexual activity with out proper means of birth control that you feel comfortable with. However you might consider that a healthy sexual relationship as an adult requires a mature mentality regarding the activity. If you're uncomfortable discussing sex, should you be engaging in sexual intercourse? I would very much recommend that you find a female OBGYN in your area to discuss options and concerns, this will be covered by your health insurance as preventative maintenance, just as a check up from your GP would be. Also it would be within your rights as a patient to go to the office, tell the front desk you are looking to establish care but would like to meet and greet with the female provider before scheduling an appointment. You are capable of shopping for a provider that you are comfortable with. It all comes down to how important this issue is to you and your motivation to address your concerns. Good luck out there, consider your physical and mental health first above all else. "

252,"OP, you need to be realistic about the fact that the original commenter is going to represent to vast majority of men. Telling a guy ""Yeah I'm never going to want to have PIV sex"" is a huge deal breaker for nearly ever man out there, because it's a natural part of a heterosexual relationship. If PIV had to be put off with a definitive end point (ex: you had surgery down there and had to avoid sex until you were healed) then at least there's a light at the end of the tunnel. You're saying there's no light. You couldn't possibly know that PIV sex would be unenjoyable for you even without the pain since you've never experienced it. Tons of women don't *orgasm* from PIV alone, but that doesn't mean they don't enjoy PIV as a sexual act, and most orgasm before or after PIV by oral/manual means anyway. Have you ever orgasmed, OP? 

I think you need to approach this with a more positive mindset. Right now you're saying ""I'm never going to have PIV"" sex, even though you never actually have. Losing one's virginity is rarely ever comfortable as a woman, and it's quite painful for many others. That's normal. It's quite possible that you are just ""tight"" and having a pushy, unsupportive ex who made you nervous and guilty didn't help you relax down there. With the right partner and mindset you could get past this. Right now you're obviously still carrying some pretty negative feelings about your ex, and letting that dictate the future of your sex life. That's toxic, OP, stop it. I get where you're coming from, though, I had a bad ex who forced sex on me a lot and it left me with a horrible attitude towards sex and never wanting to do it. But I worked on that attitude because I deserve a happy sex life, and I sure as hell wasnt going to let an ex ruin that for me. 

Worst case scenario though you have vaginismus, which is a clinical problem with spastic pelvic floor muscles creating very painful sex. You need to see your doctor about this instead of throwing in the towel. At the very least approach this with men you date as ""I've never actually had sex because it's been very painful when I've tried. I'm not saying it's off the table with us, but you'll have to be patient and work with me on it."" This shows you're still sexually attracted to the guy, and you're actually interested in fixing it; that's wildly more enticing than ""You're never putting your penis in my vagina."" Which, if that's your MO, you need to be realistic that you aren't going to have your pick of the litter when it comes to romantic partners. Sure, that's unfair, but that's reality here. 

Edit to add: And as far as birth control goes, the risk of blood clot if you're taking the pill and not smoking cigarettes is minuscule. How many women out there are on birth control and *not* dying? Millions, if not billions are using hormonal birth control. Combine that with a condom and you're multiplying 99% effectiveness with 98% effectiveness. The chances of an unwanted pregnancy occurring are near *impossible*. I get the fear, no woman wants an unwanted pregnancy, but you should also be realistic about the risk."

Childhood masturbation starts much earlier than age seven and is part of children learning their body (e.g.  Leung, Robson (1993): Childhood masturbation. in: Clinical Pediatrics, Vol 32(4), Apr 238-241.) and is absolutely normal. It seems so ""young"" because we don't retain memory of it happening early into adulthood. That's why most people imagine themselves ""starting to masturbate"" around 10-11, when in reality they simply don't remember it happening earlier.

273,"Yes. People will say that men aren't very emotional or sentimental, but it's bullshit. 

Men want to be wanted. 

When reddit always offers the sage relationship advice ""give him more blowjobs"", this is what they are getting at. Blowjobs are great, but showing a man that you *want* to give him blowjobs because you want *him* is going to drive most men wild. It's why porn aimed at men often has women admire the dude's dick so much or has them desperately want his cum on their face. It isn't just about cumming on a face, part of it is about her *wanting* his cum on her face.

And the dick isn't the only way to get to a man's heart. Men want to be wanted romantically too. That's why this one-last-look thing is getting such a response. We can be super sentimental about this. It helps show that desire is mutual. Another example is if the girl texts the guy first after a first date. 

The basic chemistry of mutual attraction is important too, of course. Men want to be wanted by the women they want. But as long as that is true, affirmation and demonstration of desire can really help keep his attention. Or keep him at attention. "

313,"The only person who can put you in the friend zone is you.  No one else can do it.

After some time of hanging out he laments being put in the friend zone by her, meanwhile she has no fucking clue he wants a romantic relationship, she just thinks she has a friend.  Who is a guy.

Guy put himself in the friend zone by not asking her out and being direct.

Second is the tricky, conniving girl who a guy asks out, says ""I just want to be friends"" then proceeds to still accept gifts and shit, and maybe even calls the dude up for favors.  Dude laments that those tricky women got him in the friend zone for free shit.

And that's a situation where either A) she fucking said she wasn't interested so stop trying to date her because I fucking know if some chick was buying me free shit I'd probably not stop her because... free shit.  Or B) she ain't your friend and why the fuck are you letting her do that shit? 

Both cases, dude put himself in the friend zone.  And in both cases it's got a wrong name as they ain't friends - he's a creep who can't accept No or she's an abusive manipulator.  Not friends.

The friend zone only exists in the mind of someone who thinks he's stuck in it.  Because he put himself there."

I've tried ever since, but I'm always terrified that I don't do nearly enough to hold up my end of the housework.

333,"In my opinion (as a woman, for the record) a slut is someone who is allowing casual sex to negatively influence her life, whether that be unplanned pregnancies, STDs, an emotional roller coaster.. but she continues to pursue casual sex despite the fact it's not working well for her. 

A slut can also be someone who pursues casual sex but makes that the main facet of her personality. She posts sexually suggestive photos on Facebook, she constantly tells anecdotes about her sexual exploits (especially when people don't want to hear them or when it's not related to the topic at hand,) she prides herself on how much guys want her and insults other women by saying that guys want her more than them, she clearly seems to be using casual sex as a way to bolster her low self confidence. 

Someone who simply enjoys casual sex does it safely, responsibly, and knows whether or not casual sex is a good option for them (I know a lot of women who want to be the type of woman who ""keeps things casual"" but always ends up catching feelings or not being able to handle it emotionally, yet they continue to pursue it.) They also don't lord it over people or make *their* casual sex *other people's* business. 

That's just my opinion. The definition of ""slut"" will be different for everyone, more negative or less negative, with more conservative or less conservative qualifiers. I honestly never find myself using the term as an insult or a descriptor for people, but if I had to define it, this is it. 

Edit to add: I use the terms ""woman"" and ""she/her"" here but a guy can definitely be a slut as well, albeit the term isn't routinely used for dudes. ""Manwhore"" comes to mind, though. "

Sadly, my roommate agreed to do it with me because it was something her boyfriend was also interested in. (Being blunt yet again, I agreed to let BOTH her boyfriend and my BF come in my mouth, then I would spit it into hers to finish it.)

I guarantee my BF would have called it off if he came first. But he didn't. I don't think he even noticed when his friend came in my mouth...he was thinking beyond the moment like I was a means to the end he wanted my roommate to do.

Well, my roommate chickened out after both of our byfriends came and I wound up swallowing because I didn't know what else to do. My relationship went to shit after that. My BF couldn't stand the idea that I swallowed and made me feel shameful about it.

Currently, I'd say truck commercials, which still look like 80's action movies, and motorcycles, which are currently marketed as though they turn you into an oddly self-sufficient beat poet."

Anyway, on one of his first days he stuck his head in my office and asked me if I could get his copies off the copier and bring them to his meeting. I thought it was weird, but he seemed nervous so I did it to help out. No big deal. The next day, our entire department was all in a meeting together, and he was presenting something. Of the 20 or so people in the room, me and the head of regulatory were the only women there (both happen to be blonde and fairly young, attractive women). In the middle of his presentation, he's writing on the white board and turns around and says to us, ""Hey can one of you girls take notes?"" Whole room got deathly quiet. I start laughing, the head of regulatory goes, ""What the fuck?"" She was legitimately angry and ended up reporting him to HR.

Takeaways:

* Open with enthusiasm for the position.

* Focus on the value you bring, not just the money you want. Especially if you can cite examples of past experience that would be helpful to the employer, i.e. ""I've tackled your company's exact issues at my last job.""

* Express slight disappointment at the initial salary offer.

* Cite sources that support your salary expectations.

* Reiterate the value you bring.

* Politely invite the employer to make a better offer.

Quoted AlwaysABride to save:

&gt;*Thanks to Gmail and their wonderful search function, here is the exact text (modified to protect anonymity) of my response to a $90,000 offer that resulted in an increase to $105,000 (this was about a decade ago, so things may be different now).*
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for the offer letter and the additional information you provided to me regarding the Company's benefits package. I continue to be excited about the opportunity to work with you and to help [the company] grow to its full potential. As I mentioned in our last conversation, I truly believe that I am an ideal fit for [the company] in this role. The position offers all the aspects I'm looking for from the day-to-day responsibility for financial reporting to the upper management roles of driving profitability, strategic management and business analysis.
&gt; 
&gt; Based upon the time I have spent with you, I believe that the keys to success for [the company] are to analyze and accurately project future cash flow, while also identifying and analyzing the costs of each specific job order. With accurate information about both cash needs and project profitability, as a management team we will be able to make business decisions in the best interest of the Company and its investors. This is very similar to the situation I was faced with when I joined [my previous employer] 5 years ago. By providing accurate financial information on a product and customer basis, we were able to make proper business decisions which led that company to strong profitability after a decade of losses. Based upon that experience, I believe I can duplicate that success at [the company].
&gt; 
&gt; However, the salary and benefits package provided for in the offer letter were significantly lower than what I was anticipating and desiring and I do not feel it reflects this value that I would bring to the Company. As we discussed during the interview process, I am flexible with my salary requirements and do not necessarily need to replace the base salary of $113,000 that I was making in my previous position. However, I was hoping to stay as close to that range as possible and anticipating a decrease closer to 5%, rather than the 20% represented by the $90,000 in the offer.
&gt; 
&gt; To make certain that I wasn't being unreasonable with my expectations, I consulted the Salary Guide for Accounting and Finance Professionals published by Accounting Principles. As you can see from the extract below, my expectations are significantly below the $129,000 average [position] salary for small companies.
&gt; 
&gt; [Salary Guide Extract with Markups.JPG]
&gt; 
&gt; I know, name, that this leaves us with a pretty big gap between the offer and what I'm looking for. I don't know how much flexibility you have to increase the offer closer to the $107,000 - $110,000 range, but I believe that is a reasonable salary for the position and would adequately reflect my skills, experience and the value that I will bring to the Company. I truly believe that adding me as an additional strong and experienced leader on your management team would lead to the financial success that you and the investors are looking for at [the company].
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to respond in writing to give you an opportunity to fully absorb and contemplate the information provided. Please let me know your thoughts and if you would like to discuss any possible alternatives in more detail, please call me. I'd also be happy to meet with you again if you feel that would be more productive.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; 
&gt; *A couple keys in this negotiation were that (a) the offer was coming from a company that I knew was struggling financially, so I wasn't sure they'd be able to afford my demands and (b) I had confidence that I could probably find a different job that paid more, and at worst could find another job that would pay me $90,000, if this one didn't work out. So even if they had told me that $90,000 was the best they could do, I would have been fine with rejecting the offer and continuing my search.*

As you said, it is important because sex is amazing, it's bonding, and good sex life/communication is required for long term relationships. You can not expect a partner to be fine with it and stick with you. Some might, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be rare (and you might wonder about their goals/inner workings).

I doesn't make you broken for all and every relationship, but IMHO it does make you not a good partner for relationships in which sex is important. Whatever is causing your vagina to be grumpy, adress it asap (both on a physical and psychological plan) if you feel like it, because it's cutting you off a large part of the dating pool. 

That being said, don't stress it out too much, because dating &amp; sex isn't the only thing in life. (And maybe get on some form of contraception if it's really stressing you out, regarless on your ability to have PIV).

Edit: I'm assuming PIV is your main form of sex. If I find a partner that shares other sexlife elements (kinks, good anal/oral skills), but can't have PIV sex, it could be fine short term, but again, I really think it's the lack of foreseeable ending to the problem that's worrying. ""I can't fuck for 3 months because X/Y/Z"" is fine, ""I might never eveeeeeeer have sex"" is an entire other ballpark.

437,"Here's advice I've shared before, for flirting in a party/bar/nightclub setting, so it's right up your alley. 

**Step 0** is to fix your mindset. 

* Love yourself.  You don't seek approval, validation and care; you generate it and provide it to yourself. This is 90 percent of the battle.  All the tactics and behavior will happen naturally if you love yourself first.

* Neediness kills attraction.  Independence ignites attraction. Believe you'll have a good time with or without her.

* She doesn't have to like you to be attracted to you. Girls often ""test"" guys they're attracted to. They want a guy who can stay cool and flirt back. Dueling with words is foreplay.

* It's okay to have needs, wants and desires. Do not feel guilty for having them.

* You are married to your mission and goals, and women are your mistress.

* Do not treat women you want like you treat your mother. Doubly true for those who grew up in religious, conservative or Asian families.  Be a gentleman to your mother but a rogue (better yet, a gentleman rogue!) to your girlfriend(s).

* Women are sexual beings.  They enjoy pleasure as much as if not more than men do. You are not doing them a favor by treating them like innocent angels. They often resent when you fall in love with a romanticized illusion, not with their real selves. You're paying her a compliment by acting like she's attractive.

* Start believing that the possibility of intimacy is always there, with every girl you talk to. 

* Feel nervous when a girl gets flirty and touches you? That's okay. There's a reason why it's called sexual *tension,* not sexual torpor. Flirting is the increase of pressure. Kissing and sex is the release of pressure. Don't fight it. *Embrace it.* 

* Your time, attention and most of all commitment are valuable. *You* have value. Don't waste them on girls who don't reciprocate your feelings. Don't give her boyfriend-level attention if she don't give you girlfriend-level affection.

* Rejection is better than regret. You'll forget the rejections. The regrets where you never made a move can haunt you for life. 

**Step 1** is to stop making self-deprecating jokes. Don't put yourself down.  That's one of the simplest, fastest and most effective things a guy can do appear more confident and attractive. Maybe later when you're doing it from a place of confidence, however it too easily falls into approval-seeking.

Don't fawn over girls because of their looks. Be the one guy who doesn't fall all over himself to impress her just because she's hot. 

**Step 2** is learning how to playfully tease girls. Tease your way into a girl's heart; don't teach your way into it. If you can get them to laugh at their own foibles, you're golden. I would start small, and ramp up as you get bolder. If you overshoot, you could piss her off.  

One mental shift that helped me was to think of flirting as ""verbal tickling"" or ""tickling with words."" A light poke, not a punch to the face.  This helped me a lot in coming up with clever lines on the fly. 

Always be playful. Also move on quickly to a new thing in the conversation; don't necessarily wait and watch for her reaction.

A little trick I've done is to notice something about the girl and mock another girl I know who has the same quirk (who's not present with us). It's a great way to practice, and the girl you're into doesn't take it personally and get offended.

Example:

&gt;Her: Sorry I'm late! I couldn't decide what to wear.

&gt;You: (chuckles confidently).  You're okay.  I knew one girl, she couldn't decide what to buy at a hot dog stand--that only sold one type of hot dog.

&gt;Her: Ha ha! Oh my God. 

I've found either girls act relieved they aren't as bad as the girl you're mocking, or they laugh and agree, ""Oh God, I'm so like that too!"" Either way, she doesn't feel personally attacked as long as you're playful. 

Make it clear you're only making fun of *one* girl though. If you speak generally or about all women, that often goes badly.

**Step 3** is speaking in a slower, lower, deeper voice, more in command. One mistake I see a lot of guys do, is they're so indecisive, even their statements sound like questions, e.g. ""I'm Ron Burgundy?"" 

Speak with more authority, not like you're trying to get approval.  More ""I'm Ron fucking Swanson."" A mind trick is to think of ""owning"" what you say. 

**Step 4** is ""I Don't Give A Fuck"" (IDGAF) level. A more concrete way to think about this is, ""Never apologize, never explain."" Obviously that's extreme.  I would experiment with not being so quick to say you're sorry, you're kidding, you're just joking unless the other party really expresses feeling offended. 

Accept that it's okay to disagree with her. It's a mistake when you say your honest opinion, a girl disagrees and you cave in or back-pedal from your statement. A lot of times, she'll respect you more for sticking to your guns. 

I can't count how many times I've hooked up with a girl after we earlier disagreed about something.  While the guys who sucked up to her and complimented everything she said were ignored.

Girls are attracted to guys who stand up for what they believe in.  Joke: what do girls think the sexiest body part of a guy is? Answer: having a spine.

**Step 5** is to touch her.  Breaking the physical barrier is tricky but absolutely essential in showing her that you're comfortable with your body and expressing interest in her.  There are tons of seduction/pickup material on what lines to say, but the most powerful communication is nonverbal, speaking through your body language.

As easy way to start off is with innocent touching, e.g. moving her out of the way when someone is trying to pass by.  If you're in a loud environment like a bar or nightclub, one of my go-to moves if I can't hear her well is to touch her lower back, tilt my head toward her and get her to talk into my ear. Feels more intimate.

If she doesn't pull away from your touch, you can escalate. Move closer, touch her arm when reacting to something funny she says, put an arm around her and if you're sitting together, press your leg against hers. Pat her knee or thigh once in a while. 

Touching progression:

Innocent &gt; Playful &gt; Flirty &gt; Sexy

Show you're not afraid of contact. If you're cool about it, often she will be too. If you're nervous and uncomfortable, she'll mirror that as well. Ideally, she should be reciprocating or accepting. 

If she's not and is looking freaked out, dial it down immediately. Maybe even bail out entirely. Read the situation and use your best judgment.

Here's a great blog post by a Redditor that goes into more detail:

**Step 6** is to get her alone.  Go outside for a smoke break, invite her to your place for a drink/a movie/whatever.  Or just say something like, ""Hey, you wanna get out of here?"" Don't overthink it and try to come up with some clever line.

You really want to get her away from her friends (if she's in a group). Best case scenario is her friends might be overprotective. That's understandable. Nothing wrong with rescuing a girl from a guy she's clearly not interested in. 

Worse case scenario is they're jealous of her and if they don't get male attention, they don't want other girls to get any either. Those are the types that will try to sabotage you, even if the girl has shown she likes you.

Also, a girl doesn't want to risk damaging her reputation. She won't be comfortable with escalating if her friends are around. Although most girls will deny this, they care a lot about what other people think (especially friends).

You want to create a little privacy bubble where she'll be more comfortable with having fun with you, without worrying about social consequences. 

**Step 7** is to make a move.  Once you've got some privacy, here's a sequence you can try:

* Look in her eyes.

* Put your hands on her hips.

* Pull her towards you.

* If she doesn't pull away, go for the kiss.  Don't: shove your tongue down her throat. Do: gently nibble her lip and touch her neck.

The key thing is you need to have been *touching her throughout the conversation*.  If you try to ambush her with a kiss at the end of the night, she might reject out of surprise even if she's into you. The earlier touching is a preview of telling her with your body language, ""Hey, I'm into you.""  So the kiss, when it happens, will feel much more natural.  

Make out with her or go further if you're both up for it.  And if she's not feeling it right now, that's okay too. 

Try to get her number so you can ask her out later. However, I leave that as the last resort. Exchanging phone numbers is the end of an interaction, not an escalation.

Unless she rejects really hard, then there was some miscommunication: she may have acted flirty without realizing it or you misread things as signals when they weren't. Don't stress, it happens.

Generally, I've found it best to escalate as much as you can the first few times you meet her. That's when you're at your most mysterious to her. You're an attractive stranger, not a friend she sees as a brother. Girls don't want to hook up with their brother. 

You're also at your most confident because you aren't invested in her yet.  It's easier to get a date after some physical intimacy, the flake factor goes way down. The whole getting-her-number-then-dating is much more of a gamble.

The keys are to keep it light, casual and fun. *You* are the party, and she's invited to tap into your energy or not. If a girl senses you're trying to ""get"" approval, validation, affection from her, it's a big turn-off.  You love yourself; and hey, you're open to her loving you too. But you don't need her.

Try to flirt with girls who have *already expressed interest in you.* For a list of hints and signals that girls like you, click on my user name and sort comments by ""Top"" ""All Time.""

438,Post accurate pictures...? 
439,I hope I'm tight enough.  Several infants have passed through there....
440,My IQ standards drop a long way if I know my friends will never find out
441,You can start by dressing up as a nurse. It makes everything you do more effective.
442,"That's good to hear. If I do eventually feel up to dating, I would like it to be with people I've spent some time with beforehand, so that they can start to see past my dwarfism.

I wouldn't feel comfortable going into the fetish scene, though. I have experienced being fetishized before and I felt like shit for months after. Something about it just made me feel less than human. So not for me I think haha"
443,"Yeah France has history of smelly cheese, snootyness and garlic. No other country can match that! 😉"
444,"I accept that the people who have casual sex have different ideas about what sex is, and that they get different things from sex. I'm not slut shaming them, but I'm certainly not joining them."
445,"I had the choice if she was going to Hawaii or an in-state school an hour away. I told her to choose Hawaii even though the major she left for is the same as the school here. We were thinking about married (after a few more years) and I could see her in the rest of my life.

It's been 6 months and I still can't drop her. I watched Titanic for the first time tonight and something in it reminded me of her, and since then I've just felt like a loser and an idiot.

If I could go back 8 months, everything would be different. I'd be happy.

I'm sorry if I'm bitching about something that's a non-issue, I just have nobody to vent to.

I really appreciate your concern and your words. I've been unable to leave this dark place I'm trapped in.

edit: more"
446,"her: no sex until we're married

*has sex with another guy a week after we break up*"
447,Sounding
448,"Wait, some of you think that 18 years old is a ""late bloomer""? Holy shit I'm fucked."
449,"I have no problem seeing a naked man, in a naked appropriate spot. The gym is fine. The homeless naked guy masturbating under the bridge I can do without. "
450,"I would never have Anal sex with a girl. Why anyone would want to stick their penis in a woman's anus, while the vagina is right next to it is beyond me. "
451,Have you ever noticed that it's always old people that say that?
452,"That's very different across Europe. Believe me, here in Northern Europe it's sacred. It makes crowded subway cars a horrendous experience for the average Scandinavian."
453,"Should be ""Don't worry what others think of you."""
454,"For all the hoops she made you jump through just to get her in the sack, there is some guy out there that she slept with on the first night because he was hotter then you.  "
455,"Don't. You made the best decision for you, and her. You let her follow her dreams, and you get to keep living your life without having our partner on the other side of the country. It may feel shitty, but it was the best choice for both of you. Break ups aren't always a bad thing, in fact they're generally a good thing."
456,"&gt;I can't afford surgery

If ever there were an argument for universal health care, this is it. "
457,They are no longer my friends. 
458,"It has to be about 25 years ago, I dated this girl and it was just one date, about a week later I was just sitting around not doing anything so I went for a drive, I decided to stop at her house just to say hey. When she answered the door I got knocked over by the smell of gas from her stove. I asked her do you smell that and she told me she had no since of smell, I got her out opened the windows and aired the house out. Low and behold we got married. So all because I was board I wound up getting married.  On a side note we divorced after 12 years because I finally figured she was a vapid bitch. But life is good now, new wife and two wonderful daughters.  "
459,"I am quite a slut. I wouldn't want to date or marry you either,  so no dramas on that front. However, I do think a few of your points are a little wrong. I encourage you by all means to keep your standards where they are because having similar values to your partner, including sexual values, is really important. 

But:

* You seem to assume that girls who have had a lot of sex are necessarily more likely to cheat.  That may actually be so statistically speaking, but really, you're conflating integrity and sexual partner count and they aren't the same thing. Liking sex (and being able to have it outside the relationship context) and being a person of one's word (ie not being a cheater) are not actually related things. If a person has integrity, and you're satisfied of that, I don't see why you'd assume they are more likely to go against that nature just because they like sex (particularly if they haven't cheated before).

* That study found a correlation, not causation. I can imagine that women who are self confident, assertive, know what they want and don't really care what other people think (ie are happy to choose to have multiple sexual partners in the face of societal slut shaming) are less likely to stay in a marriage that doesn't work for them, just because of social pressures.  That is to say, there may be very positive reasons for that statistic being the case.  I would say, personally, the better choice might be to find someone who wants a real partnership and is prepared to put the work in to achieve that. 

* In any event, the risk basically got astronomical after a woman had a few partners. You're only low level risk with a virgin, and you basically shouldn't even bother if you're further down the track than her second sexual partner. So, you know, inform yourself properly. (Aaand if we're looking for reasons, chances are quite reasonable that you're marrying a person who is pretty religious if you're at that super low partner count level. Nothing wrong with that, but it's a whole other kettle of fish.)

You seem to miss the fact that women are individuals, not statistics. While I understand wanting to optimize your odds, I think you'd be better off focusing on the things IN your control and in hers, rather than on things outside that (statistics). I can't see why those things would matter overly unless they indicated incompatibility (which in fact may well be the case for you regarding sexual and other values, and I don't mean to criticise that) or you are a really bad judge of character."
460,"Fuck those people, man. I hate it when people do that shit. We also have a handful of assholes who stick gum under the railing of the elevator, but there are some trashcans on the way out to the parking garage. "
461,"Women can be very flaky. I've noticed in general, girls are very prone to cancelling plans last minute, or simply ghosting on you out of nowhere. That's why nowadays when I set up dates with girls I've just began to know, I always have a ""backup plan"" in case she flakes. For example, hit the gym, call up a few friends to grab drinks, etc. "
462,Get over shit.  Guys seem to get over little shit a lot faster than woman.
463,"I think if a relationship feels hard more often than it feels easy, it's definitely a bad one. 

I didn't really realize this until my first good relationship - it was a revelation. "
464,I like fucking goats not children you perverted piece of shit.
465,"you don't piss _as_ you're pulling back the foreskin. fucking wait, genius."
466,"I honestly can't become motivated to flirt, date, pursue, etc. I just don't have any desire even if I find someone attractive or when they have expressed interest in me. There is like a psychological block. But in the words of Jonwayne, ""sometimes it's lonely but maybe I'm all I need."" So I'm not that sad about it. "
467,"There were a lot of things she said about being a very clean house person, always tidying... also being very independent, shared my fears that we'd be spending too much time together...

Yeah it was all crap.  Just as messy as I am. Hates tidying as much as I do. Relies on me for far more than I'd expected &amp; wants to spend way more time with me than I'm happy with.

But we make it work :)"
468,"You don't really need truth serum for this, you could probably just have a normal conversation about it"
469,"Fuck man, you're such a good guy. Legit no sarcasm. Know you made the right decision, even if it feels like shit right now."
470,"Stay off your goddamn phone. Period. Don't check text notifications, don't even check the time. "
471,"She tried to choke me with her tit the night we first hooked up. It was an accident but pretty funny when I told her afterwards. Never told anyone.

Once I woke up and kissed her on the cheek. She was still sleeping and said ""baby don't stop"". I was shaking with laughter. She told her best friend later who references it to mess with her. 

She let me respond to her friend after she asked why she was still up at 3am on Thanksgiving. I replied ""Thankful for Daddy's dick this evening"". Her friend took a screen shot and made it her snapchat story. At least 200 people saw. She was embarrassed, but got over it. 

Oh and I guess some of Reddit knows now."
